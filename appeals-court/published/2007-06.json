Dudek of the South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Special Assistant Attorney General Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina T. Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Appellant, Braxton J. Bell, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in (1) failing to disqualify the Tenth Judicial Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office and (2) refusing to dismiss a juror.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBraxton Bell was indicted for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime in regard to the shooting death of Jonathan Gambrell at the Newport Commons apartment complex in Anderson County.Â  The case proceeded to trial, at which time Bell presented a claim of self-defense.Â  The jury convicted Bell of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter, as well as the weapon possession charge.Â  The trial court sentenced him to thirty years for manslaughter and five years for possession of the firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBell raises two issues on appeal.Â  He contends the trial court erred in refusing to disqualify the Tenth Judicial Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office from prosecuting the case because a current investigator with the Solicitorâ€™s Office was a former investigator for the Anderson County Public Defenderâ€™s Office who had interviewed appellant while with the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  He further maintains the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss a juror who reported she was asked by a daycare worker whether she was serving on the case where the daycare workerâ€™s cousin had been shot.\r\nI.Â Disqualification of Solicitorâ€™s Office\r\nThe record shows that at the start of the case, Bell made a motion to disqualify the Solicitorâ€™s Office from prosecuting his case arguing there was a conflict of interest based on the investigator for the Solicitorâ€™s Office, Jimmy Penn, having previously interviewed Bell while Penn was an investigator for the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  Counsel for the defense stated it was his belief that â€œthere was information transferred from Mr. Penn to the Solicitorâ€™s Officeâ€ resulting in actual prejudice to Bell.Â  Counsel further asserted, even if the court found no actual prejudice, the Solicitorâ€™s Office should be disqualified based on â€œthe perception of a conflictâ€ in Penn â€œswitching from one side to the other.â€Â  Finally, counsel maintained failure to disqualify the Solicitorâ€™s Office would violate Bellâ€™s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because when Penn â€œswitched sidesâ€ it caused a chilling effect on Bell being able to talk to his attorneys.Â  \r\nThe trial court held an in camera hearing on the matter at which time the defense presented Bellâ€™s testimony.Â  Bell stated that on November 16, 2004, Penn came to the jail to talk to him about his case.Â  Penn identified himself at that time as an investigator with the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  Penn asked Bell some questions and Bell told him he was being charged with murder, that he and the victim had been arguing, and that someone else shot the victim and he, Bell, ran with the others.Â  This information was recorded on the bottom of an interview sheet.Â  Penn spoke with Bell for about fifteen or twenty minutes.Â  Bell testified that Penn only came to see him that one time, and sometime after January 1, 2005, he learned from other inmates that Penn had become an investigator for the Solicitorâ€™s Office.Â  Bell maintained that he felt betrayed when Penn switched sides and that when a different attorney appeared to represent him at his preliminary hearing than the one who had been to see him twice before, he felt betrayed again.Â  According to Bell, this created a difficulty in him discussing the case with his current attorney, and the first time they discussed self-defense was approximately two weeks before trial.Â  \r\nThe State then called Penn to the stand to testify in the hearing.Â  Penn stated that he began working for the Solicitorâ€™s Office on January 12, 2005, having previously worked for the Anderson County Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  Penn acknowledged it was his handwriting on the client interview sheet[2] dated November 16, 2004.Â  However, he stated it was routine for him to go to the jail and speak with clients and he would see approximately ten to twenty clients a week.Â  He did not remember what he had written on the document until defense counsel stated what the interview sheet included. Â Penn stated he remembered a bond reduction request form for Bell that had been faxed to him at the Solicitorâ€™s Office from the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  He recalled he brought the matter to the prosecuting attorneyâ€™s attention, who relayed to Penn there was no change of circumstances justifying a reduction in bond, which Penn then relayed to the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  His only other involvement with this case was to serve subpoenas on witnesses, which he did because the prosecuting attorneyâ€™s investigator was off work that week.Â  He further denied ever speaking to the other investigator about the case and denied talking to the witnesses he served about the case.Â  When asked if he had shared any confidential information with the solicitor that he learned from Bell at the interview, Penn replied, â€œAbsolutely not.â€Â  He further denied having any confidential conversations with anyone else involved in the matter.Â  \r\nThe trial court found there was no prejudice to Bell, noting he believed Penn did not even remember the interview and, even if he had, that information was not unduly prejudicial.Â  It found that Pennâ€™s service of subpoenas was a ministerial act and the evidence showed Penn did not take that opportunity to discuss the case with anyone.Â  It further determined there was nothing Penn did in response to the bond reduction request that would amount to prejudice to Bell. Â Finally, the court found any chilling effect on Bellâ€™s cooperation with his attorney was an unreasonable reaction.Â  The court therefore denied Bellâ€™s motion to disqualify the Solicitorâ€™s Office.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Bell contends the trial court erred in failing to disqualify the Solicitorâ€™s Office based on the fact that Bell initially denied to Penn that he shot the victim, and this denial was clearly inconsistent with the self-defense claim he presented at trial. Â He argues his right to effective representation was adversely affected by Pennâ€™s betrayal, that Pennâ€™s later participation in his prosecution created more than just an appearance of impropriety, and that there was no clear evidence that no actual breach of confidence occurred.Â  Bell also asserts Pennâ€™s participation likely led the Solicitorâ€™s Office to feel, because of Bellâ€™s initial statement to Penn, that Bellâ€™s claim of self-defense was not genuine, therefore adversely affecting the trial and any effort to plea bargain his case.Â  He thus maintains the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to disqualify the Solicitorâ€™s Office and he is therefore entitled to a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 299 S.E.2d 686 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), our supreme court addressed the standard for disqualification of a Solicitorâ€™s Office where an attorney in that office had been employed by the Public Defenderâ€™s Office during the pendency of charges against the appellant.Â  There, the court rejected the standard of a presumption of betrayal from mere allegation of successive adverse representation resulting in a per se disqualification.Â  Id. at 518, 299 S.E.2d at 688.Â  Instead, the court adopted the requirement of a showing of actual prejudice to the defendantâ€™s case.Â  Id. at 518-19, 299 S.E.2d at 688. Finding no evidence that any secrets or confidences of Smart were revealed, the court affirmed the denial of Smartâ€™s motion for disqualification.Â  Id. at 520-521, 299 S.E.2d at 689.Â  Thereafter, in State v. Chisolm, 312 S.C. 235, 439 S.E.2d 850 (1994), our supreme court again articulated that an appellant who seeks disqualification of a Solicitorâ€™s Office must show actual prejudice.Â  Id. at 238, 439 S.E.2d at 852.\r\nBell attempts to distinguish Smart on the basis that the attorney involved in that case did not discuss evidentiary matters or trial strategy with Smart while working for the defense, whereas investigator Penn interviewed Bell regarding the circumstances surrounding the incident.Â  He argues that involvement with the defense, along with Pennâ€™s later involvement in the request for bond reduction and service of subpoenas while working for the Solicitorâ€™s Office, adversely affected the trial of his case and any effort to plea bargain.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Smart, attorney DuTremble was assigned to prepare a brief on behalf of Smart while working for the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  Thereafter, attorney DuTrembleâ€™s work for the prosecution consisted of research on a narrow issue of law regarding admissibility of certain psychiatric evaluations.Â  Our supreme court, noting attorney DuTremble denied under oath that he personally spoke with Smart or that he discussed evidentiary matters or trial strategy with Smartâ€™s counsel, determined the facts failed to suggest betrayal of any secrets or confidences.Â  Smart, 278 S.C. at 519, 299 S.E.2d at 688-89.Â  While, in the case at hand, investigator Penn admitted the client interview document regarding Bell was in his handwriting, he denied remembering the contents of the document, stating he interviewed anywhere from ten to twenty clients a week when he worked for the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  Further, his involvement with Bellâ€™s case once he moved to the Solicitorâ€™s Office was minimal, involving only ministerial acts.Â  There simply is no evidence investigator Penn was involved with any substantive or strategic prosecution work suggestive of betrayal of any secrets or confidences.Â  Indeed, Penn denied ever speaking to the prosecuting attorney or the other investigator at the Solicitorâ€™s Office or any of the witnesses he served about the case, and adamantly maintained under oath that he had no confidential conversations with anyone else involved in the matter.Â  Contrary to Bellâ€™s assertion, a thorough review of the record reveals no breach of confidence occurred and there was no actual prejudice to Bell.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we find no merit to Bellâ€™s argument that he was adversely affected in any effort to plea bargain his case.Â  First, we note there is no evidence of record that Bell ever attempted to attain a plea bargain.Â  Second, Bell has no constitutional right to plea bargain.Â  See State v. Chisolm, 312 S.C. 235, 237-38, 439 S.E.2d 850, 851-52 (1994) (holding, where appellant claimed prejudice because the solicitor failed to negotiate any plea agreement in matter where assistant solicitor had inappropriate communication with appellant during pendency of charges, appellant failed to show actual prejudice necessary to disqualify the solicitorâ€™s office, noting appellant had no constitutional right to plea bargain).\r\nFinally, Bell cites the case of State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000) for the proposition that our courts will not tolerate â€œinterference or corruption into attorney-client confidencesâ€ and that a solicitorâ€™s office should be disqualified based on the damage such interference does to our entire criminal justice system.Â  Quattlebaum is clearly distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  There, our supreme court found the solicitorâ€™s office should have been disqualified based on a violation of Quattlebaumâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as well as to protect the integrity of the judicial system, where a member of the prosecution team intentionally eavesdropped on a confidential defense conversation.Â  The court held in Quattlebaum that a defendant must show either deliberate prosecutorial misconduct or prejudice to make out a Sixth Amendment violation of right to counsel, but not both.Â  Id. at 448, 527 S.E.2d at 109.Â  It noted that deliberate prosecutorial misconduct raises an irrebuttable presumption of prejudice.Â  Id. Â The court further held the solicitorâ€™s office should have also been disqualified because the deliberate prosecutorial conduct threatened rights fundamental to liberty and justice, calling into question the integrity of the entire judicial system. Â Id. at 449, 527 S.E.2d at 449.Â  Here, however, there is no such deliberate prosecutorial misconduct.Â  Because we have found no actual prejudice to Bell, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to disqualify the Solicitorâ€™s Office from the prosecution of Bellâ€™s case.\r\nII. Dismissal of Juror\r\nFollowing jury selection, the trial court informed the jurors the trial would not start until after lunch and they were to be back at 3:00 oâ€™clock that afternoon.Â  The court instructed the jurors that they should not talk to anybody about the case and if anyone asked them, to tell them they had been selected to serve on a jury but they could not even tell them the name of the case.Â  He told the jurors not to discuss the case among themselves or with anyone else.Â  Upon their return, the trial court informed the parties one of the jurors had reported someone talked to her about the case when she took her child to daycare and explained she may be late coming back to get the child because she was on a jury. Â The trial court then brought the juror in for questioning to determine whether she should be disqualified.Â  The following colloquy occurred between the judge and the juror:\r\n\r\n  [Court]:Â  . . . I understand you had something that happened at lunch you wanted to inform the court about?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  [Court]:Â  Tell us about that, please.\r\n  [Juror]:Â  I took my son to a daycare and was explaining to them why it was last minute, that they were squeezing him in, they didnâ€™t have room, but I had been selected for the jury, for jury duty.Â  Thatâ€™s all I said.\r\n  [Court]:Â  This is not a regular daycare?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  Itâ€™s an after-school type thing.\r\n  [Court]:Â  I mean, is it one you regularly use?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  Yeah, itâ€™s one I go to during the school year, but not during the summer because I teach.\r\n  [Court]: All right.\r\n  [Juror]:Â  And one of the girls in there said, â€œMy cousin was shot, and his trial begins today.Â  Are you on that jury?â€Â  And I said, â€œI canâ€™t talk about it.â€\r\n  [Court]:Â  So you think her cousin was the victim in the case?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  The victim, yeah, thatâ€™s the way it sounded.\r\n  [Court]:Â  Okay.Â  And that was the conversation?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  (Nodded head.)Â  And then she started to tell another child, and I left the room, and all I heard was, â€œMy cousin was shot.â€Â  She repeated that.\r\n  [Court]:Â  All right.Â  Would anything about that incident cause you to fear your ability to be a fair and impartial juror to both the State and the defendant?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  Not me personally.Â  I donâ€™t know if she thinks something, if she thinks that Iâ€™m on this jury - - I donâ€™t . . .\r\n  [Court]:Â  But it wouldnâ€™t affect your decision?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  No, it wouldnâ€™t affect my decision.\r\n  [Court]:Â  Is she someone that you knew, that you regularly - - -\r\n  [Juror]:Â  She was a former student of mine.\r\n  [Court]:Â  Okay.Â  But it wouldnâ€™t affect your ability;Â  you could put that aside and make your decision based solely on what you hear in this courtroom?\r\n  [Juror]:Â  Yes, yes.\r\n  [Court]:Â  All right.Â  You did nothing - - you did absolutely right, number one in the way you handled it, and number two telling the bailiff as soon as you got back.Â  So weâ€™ll be ready to get started in just a couple minutes, so please retire to the jury room.Â  And donâ€™t discuss this with any other juror.Â  Thank you, maâ€™am.\r\n  [Juror]:Â  I wonâ€™t, I promise.\r\n\r\nThe State had no objection to having this juror continue in service.Â  The defense, however, did, stating that if the juror was close to the daycare worker, â€œshe may lean that way unintentionally.â€ Â The defense further expressed concern that when she took her child into the daycare again, the juror might be asked something about the case and, even though she would probably indicate she could not talk about it, the juror would feel pressured.Â  It thus asked that the juror be removed.Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s initial response was that it was going to excuse the juror stating, â€œIâ€™m going to excuse her, not because I think - - Iâ€™m just going to excuse her because I got two alternates, and hopefully weâ€™ll finish this trial by Thursday. . . .â€Â  After the State and the defense agreed the trial should be finished in that time, the trial court changed its ruling.Â  The court explained its decision as follows:\r\n\r\n  I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s done anything wrong.Â  I was very impressed with the way she answered the questions.Â  Sheâ€™s a school teacher, sheâ€™s intelligent, she knew what to do.Â  She handled it properly at the time, she didnâ€™t discuss it, and she reported it immediately.Â  And so I . . . Iâ€™m not gonna excuse her.Â  I think sheâ€™s a qualified juror.Â  Had she answered the question in the same fashion as we were qualifying the jury, that she knew the cousin of the victim was working at the daycare, then I would not have disqualified her at that time.Â  Of course you [the defense] would have had an opportunity to strike at that time.\r\n\r\nThe defense noted its exception to the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  It further requested, if the juror remained on the jury, the court continue to question her in the morning about whether sheâ€™d had any further discussions.Â  The trial court agreed to caution the juror that she should not speak to anybody else about the matter and to report it immediately if anyone tried to speak with her.Â  The court refused to excuse the juror, however, stating, â€œBecause I think sheâ€™s qualified, I think sheâ€™s very honest when she answered the question.Â  Iâ€™m very impressed with the way she handled the entire situation, and so I think thereâ€™s no need to excuse her from this jury.â€ Â \r\nIn its preliminary instructions to the jury, the trial court informed them they should not speak to anyone about the case, and told them to report back immediately if someone did try to speak to them about it.Â  When the court later recessed for the day, it again instructed the jury not to talk with anyone about the case, and if anyone attempted to talk with them, they should report it to the bailiff the first thing in the morning. Â After the jury exited the courtroom, the trial court stated, â€œLet the record note that I admonished the jury not to talk about the case and to report back in the morning of any efforts to contact her.Â  I looked directly at [the juror ], who was in previously, and she nodded to me both times.Â  So I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any point of me singling her out;Â  she got the message and nodded both times.â€Â  The court further cautioned the members of the victimâ€™s family present in the courtroom not to contact the daycare worker who was the cousin of the victim.Â  When the trial resumed the next morning, the jury was questioned whether any of them heard anything about the case or were contacted by anyone in regard to it, and the court received a negative response.Â  At the conclusion of testimony for that day, the trial court again instructed the jury not to talk about the case, and again received a negative response when it asked the jury the next morning if any of them had been contacted by anyone in regard to the case.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Bell contends the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the juror.Â  He argues the colloquy between the court and the juror shows the juror was apprehensive and uncomfortable about the situation.Â  He further maintains, even accepting the juror would not have been disqualified had the relationship been raised during voir dire, because this juror would continue to see the decedentâ€™s cousin who was caring for the jurorâ€™s child, this juror would have been removed by the exercise of a peremptory challenge. Â Accordingly, Bell asserts the trial court abused his discretion in refusing to replace the juror.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA â€˜defendant has a constitutional right to be tried by competent jurors,â€™ which â€˜implies a tribunal both impartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.â€™â€Â  State v. Hurd, 325 S.C. 384, 389, 480 S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1996) (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 134, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 2755, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987) (Marshall, J., dissenting)).Â  A decision on whether to dismiss a juror and replace her with an alternate is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and such decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Smith, 338 S.C. 66, 71, 525 S.E.2d 263, 265 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  More specifically, â€œ[i]t is within the discretion of the trial court to determine whether bias results from a jurorâ€™s reception of outside information concerning the case being tried.â€Â  Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 118, 451 S.E.2d 894, 900 (1994).Â  See also State v. Ivey, 331 S.C. 118, 123, 502 S.E.2d 92, 94 (1998) (noting a jurorâ€™s competence is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and is not reviewable on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence).\r\nBell relies on the case of State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 567 S.E.2d 244 (2002) in arguing the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to remove the juror. Â In Stone, the defendantâ€™s aunt was called as a witness during the sentencing phase of the trial.Â  When the aunt took the stand, one of the jurors informed the court that she knew the aunt.Â  Although the auntâ€™s name had been announced at the start of voir dire, the juror did not know her name.Â  The juror had lived down the street from the aunt some five or six years earlier, and they were casual acquaintances only.Â  The State objected to the continued participation of the juror arguing it would be difficult for the juror to impose a death sentence on a former acquaintanceâ€™s nephew, and the trial court removed the juror, replacing her with an alternate.Â  Our supreme court reversed, finding the trial court abused its discretion in removing the juror.Â  Id. at 448-49, 567 S.E. 2d at 247-48.Â  Bell maintains, unlike the finding of the court in Stone that failure to disclose an acquaintance with a witness would not have been a material factor in the exercise of a peremptory challenge, the juror here would have been removed by the exercise of a peremptory challenge and therefore the trial court abused its discretion in failing to remove the juror.Â  In Stone, however, the court reaffirmed the following proposition:\r\n\r\n  When a juror conceals information inquired into during voir dire, a new trial is required only when the court finds the juror intentionally concealed the information, and that the information concealed would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material factor in the use of the partyâ€™s peremptory challenges.\r\n\r\nId. at 448, 567 S.E.2d at 247 (quoting State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 587-88, 550 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  Here, there is no concealment, intentional or otherwise, of information by a juror.Â  Thus, the language from Stone regarding whether the information would have been a material factor in the use of a peremptory challenge is inapplicable to this case.\r\nThe record here discloses the trial court properly inquired into the jurorâ€™s exposure to outside information and the effect the information would have on her ability to be a fair and impartial juror.Â  Contrary to Bellâ€™s assertion, the juror unequivocally stated this outside knowledge would not affect her decision or her ability to be fair and impartial.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing her to remain on the jury.Â  See State v. Ivey, 331 S.C. 118, 122-23, 502 S.E.2d 92, 94 (1998) (holding, where juror sent note to judge during trial that she knew individual who allegedly loaned murder weapon to defendantâ€™s accomplice, trial judge properly inquired into the effect jurorâ€™s knowledge of this person would have on her ability to be fair and impartial, and juror unequivocally stated such knowledge would have no effect on her ability to render an impartial verdict, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing juror to remain on the jury);Â  Washington v.

Gambrell, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In\r\n  this breach of contract action,Hall Contracting Corporation (Hall) appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s\r\n  finding for Hardaway Concrete Company, Inc. (Hardaway) and awarding Hardaway\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and modify.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina Public Service\r\n  Authority (Santee Cooper) sought bids for suppliers and contractors in the\r\n  construction of a new power plant in Cross, South Carolina.Â  Initially,\r\n  Santee Cooper sought bids from suppliers of the materials to be used in the\r\n  construction process.Â  Hardaway submitted a successful bid to become the\r\n  concrete supplier and entered into a contract with Santee Cooper.Â  The\r\n  contract provided that Hardaway set up two on-site concrete plants: a primary\r\n  plant with a rated capacity of 150 cubic yards of concrete per hour and a\r\n  backup plant with a rated capacity of 100 cubic yards of concrete per hour.Â  The\r\n  contract specified the concrete be delivered to the jobsite in a â€œtimely and\r\n  continuous manner.â€ Â Hardaway would be paid by the concrete placement\r\n  contractor, not Santee Cooper, according to the cubic yards agreed to on the\r\n  batch tickets. Â Further, the contract required Hardaway to furnish\r\n  â€œ[i]ce making and cooling equipment for temperature control during hot weather\r\n  concrete placementâ€ and provided for the price per pound of ice Hardaway would\r\n  receive. Â \r\nAfter accepting Hardawayâ€™s bid, Santee\r\n  Cooper sought bids for concrete placement contractors for the foundation of the\r\n  chimney.Â  Hall submitted the lowest bid at $1,746,652.Â  The other\r\n  bids were higher than Hallâ€™s by at least $200,000. Â Ultimately, Hall received\r\n  the contract for the concrete placement work.Â  Hallâ€™s contract provided\r\n  that it would pay for the concrete by the cubic yards agreed to on the batch\r\n  tickets.Â  \r\nHall sent Hardaway a facsimile (First\r\n  Facsimile) stating, â€œHall Contracting agrees to the unit rates, terms and\r\n  conditions listed in Santee Cooper contract . . . (see attached copy).â€Â  The\r\n  attached copy of the contract contained Hardawayâ€™s right to charge for ice.Â  On March 17, 2003, Hall sent Hardaway a purchase order regarding the first\r\n  pour, specifying how long the pour would take and stating it would be â€œusing\r\n  two pump and requires a minimum of 200 [cubic yards] per hour (100 [cubic\r\n  yards] to each pump).â€Â  Although the purchase order contained a space for\r\n  Hardaway to sign, Hardaway never signed the purchase order.Â  Hall sent\r\n  Hardaway a purchase order before each of the five pours, purporting to set out\r\n  a specific schedule for the rate of the concrete.Â  Hardaway never signed any of\r\n  these purchase orders.Â  \r\nAfter the completion of the project, Hardaway\r\n  billed Hall for the supplied concrete.Â  Hall paid all but $45,123.84 and sent\r\n  Hardaway a letter informing Hardaway that Hall was due a credit in that amount\r\n  from Hardaway.Â  Hardaway brought suit against Hall for breach of contract for\r\n  failure to pay the $45,123.84.Â  Hall answered and counterclaimed that it\r\n  and Hardaway entered into an enforceable agreement to supply concrete at a\r\n  minimum rate of 200 cubic yards per hour.Â  Hall alleged Hardaway breached the\r\n  contract and asked for damages of $45,123.84.Â  \r\nAt trial, David Russell, a senior\r\n  vice-president at Hall, testified that during the bid process, Hall contacted\r\n  Hardaway to confirm the capacity of the concrete plants and learned the\r\n  capacities Hall had been given were â€œrated capacities and not actual production\r\n  capacitiesâ€ and Hall could expect a maximum of 200 cubic yards year hour.Â  He\r\n  testified that Hall based a lot of its pricing on that information.Â  Russell\r\n  testified that Hall lost around $60,000 on the Santee Cooper job and probably\r\n  made an error in estimating.Â  Further he testified the error was made by an\r\n  estimator who was fired, in part, for his mistakes in estimating.Â  Â \r\nThe master found Hall was a third-party beneficiary in the\r\n  contract between Hardaway and Santee Cooper, and Hardaway was a third-party\r\n  beneficiary of the contract between Hall and Santee Cooper.Â  Further,\r\n  the master found Hardaway and Hall also formed a contract in the First Facsimile.Â \r\n  The master determined Hardaway produced and delivered the concrete as\r\n  contemplated in the agreements and accordingly, Hall owed Hardaway the\r\n  remainder of $45,123.84.Â  Further, it found Hall fraudulently, and in bad faith,\r\n  generated a list of back charges.Â  Additionally, the master granted\r\n  Hardawayâ€™s motion to amend its complaint to include a claim for attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  under section 27-1-15\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (1991).Â  \r\nOn January 5, 2006, the master held a separate hearing on\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The master found that Hardaway had met its burden of\r\n  showing Hall had not conducted a fair and reasonable investigation and was thus\r\n  entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees under section 27-1-15.Â  Accordingly, the master\r\n  awarded Hardaway attorneyâ€™s fees of $53,592.56.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the findings of\r\n  fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266\r\n  S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  The rule is the same whether the trial courtâ€™s findings are made\r\n  with or without reference.Â  Id.Â  The trial courtâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in\r\n  a law action.Â  Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 567, 211\r\n  S.E.2d 876, 877 (1975).Â  This court must determine whether any\r\n  evidence reasonably supports the factual findings of\r\n  the trial court.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd., 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 776. Â Additionally, the appellate court can correct errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Se. Site\r\n    Prep, L.L.C. 353\r\n  S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003). Â â€œThis scope of review is equally applicable to the\r\n  factual determinations of a master when, as in the present case, he enters\r\n  final judgment.â€Â  Wigfall v.\r\n    Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 61, 367 S.E.2d 156,\r\n  157 (1988).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Interpretation of the\r\n  contract\r\nHall argues the master erred in awarding judgment in\r\n  favor of Hardaway.Â  Specifically, Hall contends the master erred in finding:\r\n  (1) Hardaway was not bound by the concrete production rates provided in the\r\n  purchase orders and pour specifications; and (2) Hardaway was entitled to charge\r\n  for ice.Â  \r\nA.Â  Pour Rate\r\nHall argues the\r\n  master erred by not finding Hardaway was bound by the pour specifications\r\n  requested by Hall.Â  Hall argues the sale of concrete is a transaction of goods,\r\n  and therefore, Article 2 of the U.C.C. governed the transaction.[1]Â \r\n  Hall argues Hardaway was aware of the specifications and knew that Hall was\r\n  relying on Hardaway to provide concrete consistent with those provisions.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  Hall proceeded solely under a contract theory at trial.Â  It did not raise the\r\n  U.C.C. issue in its answer or in arguments during trial.Â  Because the issue was\r\n  not raised before the master, the master did not get the opportunity to rule\r\n  upon the question of whether Hardawayâ€™s actions violated the U.C.C.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review and we may not address it.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729,\r\n  732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional\r\n  circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Ice\r\nHall argues the\r\n  masterâ€™s finding that it was responsible for $1,874.50 in ice charges was not supported\r\n  by the evidence.Â  Hardaway argues this issue is not preserved.Â  At oral\r\n  argument, Hardaway alternately argued that it is irrelevant that its original\r\n  contract with Santee Cooper was later altered to disallow ice charges because\r\n  Hall sent Hardaway a fax adopting the original contract between Hardaway and\r\n  Santee Cooper.Â  We agree with Hall.\r\nThe elements\r\n  required for formation of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable\r\n  consideration. Â Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581 S.E.2d 161,\r\n  166 (2003).Â \r\n  In order for a contract to arise, there must be a meeting of the minds of the parties involved with regard to\r\n  all essential and material terms of the agreement. Â Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d\r\n  891, 893 (1989) (â€œ[I]n order to have a valid and\r\n  enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties\r\n  with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.â€); Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 290, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 917, 922 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that for a contract to arise, there\r\n  must be a meeting of the minds of the parties involved).Â  Generally,\r\n  a third person not in privity of contract with the contracting parties\r\n  does not have a right to enforce the contract.Â  Goode\r\n    v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 445, 494 S.E.2d 827,\r\n  833 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œHowever, if a\r\n  contract is made for the benefit of a third person, that person may enforce the\r\n  contract if the contracting parties intended to create a direct, rather than an\r\n  incidental or consequential, benefit to such third person.â€Â  Bob Hammond Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. Co., 312 S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nWe first address\r\n  Hardawayâ€™s argument that this issue is not preserved.Â  Hardaway admits in its\r\n  brief that Hall raised the ice issue below.Â  However, Hardaway argues the\r\n  master failed to address these specific arguments in its order. Â In fact, the\r\n  master reviewed the evidence and the arguments of both parties and determined\r\n  that Hardaway was entitled to charge for ice based on the first contract and\r\n  the fax between the parties.Â  Because Hall raised the issue of whether Hardaway\r\n  was entitled to charge for ice and the master determined Hardaway was entitled\r\n  to do so, the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the master.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the issue is preserved for appellate review.[2]Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546\r\n  (2000) (holding that matters must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court in order for the matter to be preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nOn the merits, this\r\n  case presents the situation where Santee Cooper contracted with both Hall and\r\n  Hardaway for services related to the construction of the power plant, but where\r\n  neither Hall nor Hardaway contracted with each other.Â  The master found that\r\n  Hall was the third party beneficiary of the contract between Hardaway and\r\n  Santee Cooper.Â  This finding is unappealed, and thus, it is the law of the\r\n  case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisitions Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C.\r\n  238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding that an unchallenged ruling,\r\n  right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â  \r\nWith that\r\n  understanding in mind, we believe the evidence does not support the masterâ€™s\r\n  finding that Hardaway was entitled to charge Hall for ice.Â  The original\r\n  contract with Santee Cooper provided that Hardaway was responsible for â€œ[i]ce making and cooling equipment for\r\n  temperature control during hot weather concrete placementâ€ and that Hardaway\r\n  could bill Hall for â€œsupplemental iceâ€ as necessary for cooling the concrete. Â Hall faxed a letter to Hardaway indicating it\r\n  accepted the rates and terms of Hardawayâ€™s contract with Santee Cooper.Â  However,\r\n  Hardawayâ€™s contract with Santee Cooper was later amended to disallow ice\r\n  charges.Â  A Santee Cooper employee testified at trial that the contract was\r\n  amended so that Santee Cooper would pay Hardaway a lump sum to provide all the\r\n  cooling equipment including supplemental ice.Â  Hardaway also sent a letter to\r\n  the project manager indicating that Hardaway would provide the cooling system\r\n  and that the â€œthe cost for supplemental ice, if required, is also included.â€Â \r\n  The record also includes an email from the project manager to Hardaway stating\r\n  that Hardaway was responsible for all the cooling equipment, including\r\n  supplemental ice.Â  Because Hall was the third-party beneficiary of Hardawayâ€™s\r\n  modified contract with Santee Cooper, Hardaway was not entitled to charge Hall\r\n  for ice.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  there was no substantial evidence to support the masterâ€™s finding that Hardaway\r\n  was entitled to charge Hall $1,874.50 for the provision of ice, and Hardawayâ€™s\r\n  award shall be modified to reduce it by this amount.Â Â  \r\nII. Â Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nA.Â \r\n  Amending Complaint\r\nHall\r\n  contends the master erred by allowing Hardaway to amend its complaint to add a\r\n  claim for attorneyâ€™s fees under section 27-1-15\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (1991).Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  party normally may amend his pleadings once as a matter of course within thirty\r\n  days of the time a responsive pleading has been served.Â  Thereafter, however, â€œa\r\n  party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of\r\n  the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires and\r\n  does not prejudice any other party.â€Â  Rule 15, SCRCP.Â  A motion to amend is\r\n  addressed to the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and the burden of establishing\r\n  prejudice rests on the party opposing the motion.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 313, 566\r\n  S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002).Â  â€œIn considering potential\r\n  prejudice to the opposing party, the court should consider whether the opposing\r\n  party â€˜has had the opportunity to prepare for the issue now being raised\r\n  formally.â€™â€ Â Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs,\r\n    Inc. v. Folly Assocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987) (quoting H. Lightsey &amp; J. Flanagan, South\r\n      Carolina Civil Procedure at 291 (1985)).\r\nHall admitted knowing of Hardawayâ€™s intention to seek\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees under section 27-1-515 two weeks before trial began.Â  Hardaway\r\n  contends Hall had more notice than two weeks, because Hardaway sent letters to\r\n  Hall informing it of its intention to assert the section on June 27, 2005, and the\r\n  trial did not actually begin until August 29, 2005.[3]Â  The master noted that Hall ably\r\n  argued two motions on the motion to amend and even presented the master with the\r\n  only case substantively discussing the attorneyâ€™s fee statute.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  Hall did not demonstrate prejudice, and the master did not abuse his discretion\r\n  in allowing Hardaway to amend its complaint.\r\nB.Â  Denial of\r\n  Motion to Dismiss\r\nHall asserts the master erred\r\n  in denying Hallâ€™s Rule 41(b), SCRCP, motion to dismiss the claim for attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 41(b), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\n  After the plaintiff in an action tried by the court\r\n    without a jury has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant,\r\n    without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not\r\n    granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law\r\n    the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\r\n    \r\n    The court as trier of the facts may then determine\r\n    them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any\r\n      judgment until the close of all the evidence. If the court renders judgment\r\n    on the merits against the plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in\r\n    Rule 52(a). Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a\r\n    dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this\r\n    rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue or\r\n    for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the\r\n    merits.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nHall argues the\r\n  master erred in waiting until the close of all evidence to decide the motion\r\n  because Hardaway did not present any evidence regarding an investigation.Â  As\r\n  Rule 41(b) specifically states, a court may wait until the close of evidence to\r\n  render judgment.Â  Because of the unusual manner in which the parties chose to\r\n  present evidence in order to have a more efficient trial, the master chose to wait.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the master did not err in waiting until the close of evidence to\r\n  rule on the motion.Â  The master determined that Hardaway\r\n  met its burden of showing Hall had not conducted a fair and reasonable\r\n  investigation because\r\n  Hall fraudulently, and in bad faith, generated a list of back charges.Â  The\r\n  evidence supports the masterâ€™s finding that Hall did not conduct a fair and reasonable investigation. Â Accordingly,\r\n  the master did not err in denying Hallâ€™s motion to dismiss.\r\nC.Â  Fair and\r\n  Reasonable Investigation\r\nHall argues the\r\n  master erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees under section 27-1-15.Â  Hall contends it conducted a fair and\r\n  reasonable investigation before withholding payment.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  section provides:\r\n\r\n  Whenever\r\n    a contractor, laborer, design professional, or materials supplier has expended\r\n    labor, services, or materials under contract for the improvement of real\r\n    property, and where due and just demand has been made by certified or\r\n    registered mail for payment for the labor, services, or materials under the\r\n    terms of any regulation, undertaking, or statute, it is the duty of the person\r\n    upon whom the claim is made to make a reasonable and fair investigation of the\r\n    merits of the claim and to pay it, or whatever portion of it is determined as\r\n    valid, within forty-five days from the date of mailing the demand. Â If the\r\n    person fails to make a fair investigation or otherwise unreasonably refuses to\r\n    pay the claim or proper portion, he is liable for reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n    and interest at the judgment rate from the date of the demand.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-1-15\r\n  (1991).Â  The\r\n  party seeking an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and interest under the statute has\r\n  the initial burden of presenting prima facie evidence that\r\n  the opposing party did not make a fair and reasonable investigation.Â  Moore Elec. Supply, Inc. v. Ward, 316 S.C. 367, 374-75,\r\n  450 S.E.2d 96, 100 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Whether a partyâ€™s steps taken were â€œreasonable\r\n  and fairâ€ is a question of fact.Â  Id.\r\nThe master\r\n  determined not only had Hall not made a fair and reasonable investigation, it\r\n  further â€œintentionally refused to pay [Hardaway] its rightful charges in\r\n  contravention of the agreement between the parties.â€Â  In support of this\r\n  finding, the master cited: (1) Hallâ€™s admissions regarding the amount of concrete\r\n  delivered; (2) Hallâ€™s admissions regarding amount of offsetting overtime; and\r\n  (3) Hallâ€™s attempts to vary the terms of the contract after the project was\r\n  completed.Â  We find the evidence in the record supports the masterâ€™s finding\r\n  that Hall acted in bad faith and did not make a fair and reasonable\r\n  investigation.\r\nD.Â  Amount of Attorneyâ€™s\r\n      Fees\r\nHall argues the master erred in determining the amount\r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We agree in part.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute. Â Baron\r\n    Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989).Â  â€œThe determination of whether\r\n  statutory attorney fees should be awarded is treated as one in equity.â€ Â Kilcawley v. Kilcawley, 312 S.C. 425, 427, 440\r\n  S.E.2d 892, 893 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Accordingly, in reviewing the award, we may\r\n  take our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Kelly v. Peeples, 294 S.C. 63, 65, 362\r\n  S.E.2d 636, 637 (1987).Â  â€œEven where this court may find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not required to\r\n  disregard the factual findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility and demeanor.â€ Â Â Kilcawley, 312 S.C. at 427, 440\r\n  S.E.2d at 893.\r\nâ€œOur\r\n  case law and court rules make clear that when a contract or statute authorizes\r\n  an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must make specific findings of\r\n  fact on the record for each of the required factors to be considered.â€ Â Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The factors a trial court\r\n  should consider in determining reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees are:\r\n\r\n   (1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) time and\r\n    labor devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\n    contingency of compensation; (5) fee customarily charged in the locality for\r\n    similar services; and (6) beneficial results obtained.\r\n\r\nBlumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d\r\n  659, 660 (1993).Â  â€œ[A]bsent sufficient evidentiary support on\r\n  the record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded\r\n  for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Id. at 494, 427\r\n  S.E.2d at 661.\r\nHall\r\n  raises several issues regarding the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We will address\r\n  Hallâ€™s specific reasons why the master erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  below.Â  \r\n1. Â Fees\r\n  Relating to Counterclaims\r\nHall maintains that\r\n  Hardawayâ€™s fees for defending Hallâ€™s counterclaims are not recoverable.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 483, 458 S.E.2d 431, 438-39 (Ct. App. 1995), the\r\n  defendant alleged the amount of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was improper\r\n  because some of the fees were\r\n  attributable to defending counterclaims and some were previously awarded in the\r\n  initial action.Â  This court found the distinction to be â€œspecious.â€Â  Id. at 484, 458 S.E.2d at 439. Â We held â€œ[t]he trial court clearly found that the facts and issues\r\n  surrounding the promissory note were intertwined with those of the\r\n  counterclaims which required extensive discovery and transformed\r\n  a normally uncomplicated action . . . into complex litigation.â€ Â Id. at 483-84, 458 S.E.2d at 439.Â  Further, this court agreed with the trial court and found the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees for the\r\n  counterclaim. Â Id. at 484, 458 S.E.2d at 439.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, the issues presented in Hallâ€™s counterclaims were\r\n  intertwined with Hardawayâ€™s causes of action. Â Accordingly, the master did not\r\n  abuse his discretion in allowing Hardaway to recover attorneyâ€™s fees for\r\n  defending Hallâ€™s counterclaims. Â See Am. Fed. Bank, FSB v. No.\r\n    One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 175, 467 S.E.2d 439, 443 (1996) (holding that\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees could be awarded for defending counterclaims where the\r\n  counterclaims were intertwined with the issue of the bankâ€™s ability to proceed\r\n  on a note).\r\n2.\r\n  Reasonable Fees\r\nHall argues the attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees the master awarded are not reasonable and only reasonable fees may be\r\n  recovered.Â  We disagree.\r\nHardawayâ€™s attorney\r\n  submitted an affidavit requesting $53,592.56 in attorneyâ€™s fees, including\r\n  $5,377.50 related to the motion for sanctions.Â  The master awarded all of the\r\n  fees Hardawayâ€™s attorney stated in his affidavit that he incurred.Â  The master\r\n  issued a twenty-two page order on the determination of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  While\r\n  the master did a thorough job of determining whether Hardaway had met its\r\n  burden under the statute authorizing fees, the order only contains one\r\n  paragraph on the actual amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This paragraph is the last\r\n  paragraph in the order but is the first time the actual amount of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees is addressed.Â  The master awarded Hardaway attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount\r\n  of $53,592.26, specifically finding:\r\n\r\n  This\r\n    amount includes $48,215.06 for the litigation of the . . . case, including\r\n    trial preparation fees and costs on two separate occasions.Â  In addition, the\r\n    total amount includes attorneyâ€™s fees $5,377.50 for fees and costs associated\r\n    with a motion for sanctions which [the master] previously denied.Â  Although,\r\n    [the master] denied the motion for sanctions, [the master] hereby found that\r\n    [Hardaway] incurred those attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in the course of the litigation,\r\n    and those fees and costs are properly payable. \r\n\r\nWhile\r\n  the master was required to make findings with regard to all six factors in Blumberg in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, Hall focuses only on the necessary â€œtime and\r\n  laborâ€ factor and the â€œbeneficial results obtainedâ€ factor in its argument.Â \r\n  The masterâ€™s order did not make specific findings with regard to these to\r\n  factors in the analysis.Â  However, with the exception of the motion for\r\n  sanctions and certain costs which we will discuss below, we can glean evidence\r\n  from the record on these two factors that would support the masterâ€™s award.Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Berger, 365 S.C. 234, 240, 616 S.E.2d 431, 435 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œOn appeal an award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record\r\n  supports each factor.â€).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find, except for the motion for sanctions, the record supports the masterâ€™s award\r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees to Hardaway. \r\n3.Â \r\n  Fees for Motion for Sanctions\r\nHall\r\n  argues the master erred in awarding $5,377.50 in fees for the motion for\r\n  sanctions because Hardaway lost the motion, and therefore, the fees were not\r\n  recoverable.Â  We agree.\r\nNothing\r\n  in the record supports the masterâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees for the motion for\r\n  sanctions, which Hardaway lost.Â  Hardawayâ€™s attorneyâ€™s did not obtain\r\n  beneficial results from this particular motion, and nothing in the masterâ€™s\r\n  order supports the reasonableness of this fee.Â  Accordingly, we find the master\r\n  erred in awarding $5,377.50 in attorneyâ€™s fees for the lost sanctions motion.Â \r\n  The attorneyâ€™s fees award shall be reduced by that amount. \r\n4.Â \r\n  Fees for Repreparing for Trial\r\nHall\r\n  contends that Hardawayâ€™s fees for repreparing for trial were not recoverable.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWe\r\n  find no error in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees for repreparing for trial.Â  The trial\r\n  occurred approximately two months after it was to originally begin, not simply\r\n  a few days.Â  This court finds it reasonable that counsel would need to refresh himself\r\n  pending such a period of time.\r\n5.\r\n  Â Fees Limited to Evidence Presented at Trial\r\nHall maintains that\r\n  the attorneyâ€™s fees should have been limited to evidence presented at trial and\r\n  the affidavit submitted after trial should not have been considered.Â  We disagree.\r\nHall alleges\r\n  Hardaway should be limited to the $35,762.17, the amount specified in its\r\n  damages summary as its attorneyâ€™s fees and costs â€œestimated through trial.â€Â  However,\r\n  on January 5, 2006, when the master reopened the matter to hold a hearing to\r\n  determine attorneyâ€™s fees, Hardawayâ€™s attorney submitted an affidavit stating\r\n  that Hardaway incurred fees of $53,592.56 including attorneyâ€™s fees of $5,377.50\r\n  for the motion for sanctions.Â  The additional hearing on attorneyâ€™s fees was\r\n  not anticipated in the original estimation of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The revised\r\n  estimate for attorneyâ€™s fees included many charges for services after the trial,\r\n  including researching and preparing the order.Â  Â \r\nâ€œA judge may not, after all testimony has been taken,\r\n  receive additional contested evidence without reopening the case.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 288 S.C. 270, 274, 341\r\n  S.E.2d 811, 814 (Ct. App. 1986).Â \r\n  However, in the case at hand, the case was already re-opened to hold a hearing\r\n  on attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Hall had the opportunity to contest the affidavit and\r\n  did.Â  Although the charges were presented after the trial, we find it\r\n  appropriate in the current situation to allow them.\r\n6.Â \r\n  Non-Attorney Services\r\nHall complains that\r\n  $125 in charges allowed to Hardaway were unrecoverable. Â Specifically, Hall\r\n  complains about the time spent: Â (1) copying depositions; (2) reorganizing case\r\n  file; (3) faxing documents; (4) picking up attorneys and the owner of Hardaway;\r\n  and (5) printing orders.[4]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we address Hardawayâ€™s contention that because these charges were for the\r\n  services of law clerk, â€œdrs,â€ Hall is arguing that all charges billed by law\r\n  clerks are not allowed as attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, Hall only complains about\r\n  five specific charges by â€œdrsâ€ and does not challenge any of the other charges\r\n  by â€œdrs.â€Â  Thus, it does not appear that Hall is arguing that law clerk charges,\r\n  in general, are unrecoverable as attorneyâ€™s fees, and we decline to address\r\n  this question.Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  any event, we do not believe Hall preserved this argument for appellate\r\n  review.Â  Hall sent a memorandum to the master that, among other complaints,\r\n  specifically raised the issue of the five charges for â€œdrsâ€ and whether the\r\n  five specific charges were recoverable â€œnon-attorney services.â€Â  However, the master\r\n  did not address this argument in the final attorneyâ€™s fees order, and Hall did\r\n  not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration of the matter.Â \r\n  Because the matter was not ruled upon, it is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546 (holding that\r\n  matters must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order for the\r\n  matter to be preserved for appellate review).Â  Further, Hall does not cite to\r\n  any supporting authority for its argument, rendering the issue abandoned on\r\n  appeal.Â  Joubert v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176,\r\n  192-93, 534 S.E.2d 1, 9-10 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that the failure to provide\r\n  argument or supporting authority for an issue renders it abandoned).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  evidence in the record supports the master awarding judgment in favor of\r\n  Hardaway and ordering Hall to pay the outstanding amount of $45,123.84 minus $1,874.50 for the provision of ice.Â  The master\r\n  correctly awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, we find the master\r\n  erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees for the lost sanctions motion and reduce the\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees award by $5,377.50.Â  Accordingly, the order of\r\n  the master is\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND MODIFIED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Hall further contended in its brief that even if the\r\n  contract was not governed by the U.C.C., Hardaway was estopped from objecting\r\n  to the specifications in the purchase order and pour specifications.Â  However,\r\n  at the oral argument of this case, Hallâ€™s attorney informed this court that it\r\n  was specifically waiving its estoppel argument and was proceeding solely on the\r\n  U.C.C. argument.Â  Thus, we need only address the U.C.C. argument.\r\n[2]Â  Hardaway also asserted for the first time at oral\r\n  argument that the ice issue was not preserved for review because Hallâ€™s U.C.C.\r\n  and estoppel arguments were not ruled upon by the trial judge and constitute\r\n  the â€œonly basis for appeal.â€Â  Although Hall raises U.C.C. and estoppel\r\n  arguments with regard to pour specifications in its brief, it is clear from the\r\n  separate ice argument that Hall is only referring to the wording of the\r\n  underlying contracts.Â  The contract matter was ruled upon by the master, and it\r\n  is preserved for our review. \r\n[3] The actual letters are not included in the record. Â \r\n[4]Â  Hall specifically references $125 of fees charged\r\n  for the services of â€œdrs.â€Â  Although nothing in the record indicates who â€œdrsâ€\r\n  is, Hardaway alleges that â€œdrsâ€ refers to its attorneyâ€™s law clerk.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4253","title":"Hernandez-Zuniga v.

Spann-Wilder, of North Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tTerri Morrill Lynch, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â The Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (â€œSCWCCâ€) found Andrew Tickle (â€œTickleâ€) did not regularly employ four or more employees.Â  Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not have jurisdiction to award benefits to Hernandez-Zuniga (â€œClaimantâ€).Â  The circuit court affirmed the Decision and Order of the Appellate Panel.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nClaimant sustained his injury on May 10, 2003 when he fell from a ladder while painting for his employer, Tickle.Â  He sought temporary disability benefits and medical treatment under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (Act).Â  Tickle claimed he was not subject to the Act because he regularly employed less than four workers.Â \r\n \r\nAt the time of his hearing, Claimant was a twenty-one year old Honduran with a sixth grade education who had been in the United States four years working as a painter.Â  He began working for Tickle some time in the spring of 2003.Â  Claimant worked eight hours a day and some weekends, earning ten dollars per hour.Â  Tickle paid him directly, once a week, in cash.Â  After commencing work for Tickle, Claimant worked regularly for approximately one month, until the day he fell.Â  Claimant believed he would have continued employment with Tickle had he not been injured.Â \r\n \r\nClaimant undertook three projects for Tickleâ€”one project painting beach chairs and two house-painting projects.Â  Two people, Claimant and Alle Hernandez (Alle),[2] worked on the beach chairs project.Â  Claimant, Alle, and Victor Valdez (Victor) began painting the first house owned by the Garretts.Â  Claimant and Alle subsequently went to the Hewitt[3] home while Victor purportedly continued work on the Garrett house.Â  Franklin Hernandez-Zuniga (Franklin) allegedly joined Claimant and Alle at the Hewitt home, the site where Claimant fell. Â Claimant believed Franklin began work the day before the accident and quit shortly after Claimant was injured.Â  Victor moved to the Hewitt project after Claimantâ€™s accident.Â \r\n \r\nTickle left his previous employer, the Finish Company, in 2003 and started his own business as a painting contractor.Â  He claimed he initially arranged with Claimant and the other workers to supply all the paint for the Garrett house, get a draw each week, and divide the proceeds with them, in cash, without tax deductions. Â Ultimately he paid them weekly wages at an hourly rate. Â Tickle explained he hired the workers â€œproject by projectâ€ because he had not yet established his company.Â  Claimant and his co-workers provided their own brushes and caulk guns.Â  Tickle acknowledged he agreed to pay them a flat fee of $1000 to paint the Hewitt house. Â Claimant did not complete the Hewitt project because of his injury, so Tickle paid him hourly for work completed. Â \r\nTickle asseverated there were never more than three people working for him in April or May 2003.Â  He thought someone helped finish up after Claimant fell but denied knowing anyone named Franklin working on the projects.Â  Beth Garrett, owner of the first house Tickleâ€™s crew painted, maintained she never observed more than three people working on her home.\r\nTickle obtained a business license on June 26, 2003 and established Tickle Tools in July 2003.Â  He declared he conducted no official business as Tickle Tools before July 21, 2003.\r\n \r\nThe hearing commissioner found:\r\n\r\n\tThe evidence established that upon the jobs where the Claimant worked there were only two (2) individuals on the first and three (3) on the second.Â  The only evidence of employment of four (4) employees, which is conflicting, was for a day or two.Â  Therefore, the Claimant did not meet his burden of proving the Employer â€œregularlyâ€ employed four or more employees.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the hearing commissioner ruled Claimant was not entitled to benefits under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because Tickle did not regularly employ four (4) or more employees as required by section 42-1-150 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2006).Â  Consequently, the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction to address the claim.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the hearing commissionerâ€™s ruling and adopted his Decision and Order in its entirety. Â The circuit court affirmed.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Claimant demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Tickle regularly employed four or more employees and was subject to the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nJudicial review of a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision is governed by the substantial evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43 (2006); Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  However, if the factual issue before the Commission involves a jurisdictional question, this courtâ€™s review is governed by the preponderance of evidence standard. Â Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 343 S.C. 102, 108, 538 S.E.2d 276, 279 (Ct. App. 2000) affâ€™d 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002); Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 314 S.C. 43, 45, 443 S.E.2d 803, 804 (1994); Vines v. Champion Bldg. Prods., 315 S.C. 13, 16, 431 S.E.2d, 585, 586 (1993); Porter v. Labor Depot, Op. No. 4212 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 5, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 52); Cooke v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 367 S.C. 167, 173, 624 S.E.2d 439, 441 (Ct. App. 2005); Edens v. Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 440, 597 S.E.2d 863, 867 (Ct. App. 2004); Simons v. Longbranch Farms, Inc., 345 S.C. 277, 280, 547 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 2001); Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 654 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Consequently, our review is not bound by the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact on which jurisdiction is based. Â Canady v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 265 S.C. 21, 25, 216 S.E.2d 755, 757 (1975) A reviewing court has both the power and duty to review the entire record, find jurisdictional facts without regard to conclusions of the Commission on the issue, and decide the jurisdictional question in accord with the preponderance of evidence.Â  Id ; see also Kirksey, 314 S.C. at 45, 443 S.E.2d at 804 (holding this court can find facts in accordance with the preponderance of evidence when determining a jurisdictional question in a Workersâ€™ Compensation case); Sanders v. Litchfield Country Club, 297 S.C. 339, 342, 377 S.E.2d 111, 113 (Ct. App. 1989) (deciding where a jurisdictional issue is raised, this court must review record and make its own determination whether the preponderance of evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s factual findings bearing on that issue).\r\nWorkersâ€™ compensation statutes are construed liberally in favor of coverage, and South Carolinaâ€™s policy is to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of employees within workersâ€™ compensation coverage. Â Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 343 S.C. 102, 109, 538 S.E.2d 276, 279 (Ct. App. 2000) affâ€™d 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002) (citing Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992); Oâ€™Briant v. Daniel Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 254, 305 S.E.2d 241 (1983); Horton v. Baruch, 217 S.C. 48, 59 S.E.2d 545 (1950); Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996); McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 313 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1984)).\r\n\r\n\tIn determining such jurisdictional questions, it must be kept in mind that the basic purpose of the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act is the inclusion of employers and employees within its coverage and not their exclusion, and doubts of jurisdiction will be resolved in favor of inclusion rather than exclusion. Â However, a construction should not be adopted that does violence to the specific provisions of the Act.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhite v. J. T. Strahan Co., 244 S.C. 120, 135 S.E.2d 720, 723 (1964)\r\nWhile the appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of evidence on the existence of an employer-employee relationship, the final determination of witness credibility is usually reserved to the Appellate Panel. Â See Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 441, 534 S.E.2d 700, 704 (2000) (citing Ford v. Allied Chem. Corp., 252 S.C. 561, 167 S.E.2d 564 (1969)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nClaimant contends the circuit court erred in finding Tickle was not an employer subject to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because he did not have four or more persons regularly employed.Â  Specifically, Claimant maintains that four workers were Tickleâ€™s regular employees, and three individuals were his statutory employees.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe issue of whether an employer regularly employs the requisite number of employees to be subject to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is jurisdictional.â€Â  Harding v. Plumley, 329 S.C. 580, 584, 496 S.E.2d 29, 31 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000); Roper Hosp. v. Clemons, 326 S.C. 534, 536, 484 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  On appeal from the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, this court may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n \r\nPellucidly, the appellate courtâ€™s standard of review in cases involving jurisdictional questions is not a substantial evidence standard.Â  Our precedent lucidly establishes that an appellate court reviews jurisdictional issues by making its own findings of fact without regard to the findings and conclusions of the Appellate Panel.Â  Harding, 329 S.C at 584, 496 S.E.2d at 31 (citing Kirksey, 314 S.C. at 45, 443 S.E.2d at 804).Â  Furthermore, the appellate court evaluates the record and resolves the issue by determining whether the preponderance of evidence supports inclusion under the Act.Â  Id.Â  The appellant bears the burden of showing that the circuit courtâ€™s decision is against the preponderance of evidence.Â  Gray, 339 S.C. at 182, 528 S.E.2d at 440 (citing Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 498 S.E.2d 650 (Ct. App. 1998)); Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 180 S.E.2d 648 (1971); Crim v. Decoratorâ€™s Supply, 291 S.C. 193, 352 S.E.2d 520 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nI.&nbsp; Four or More Persons Regularly Employed\r\nClaimant urges that section 42-1-360(2) does not apply in the instant case, because the greater weight of the evidence indicates Tickle had four regularly employed workers during the relevant time period.Â \r\n \r\nThe South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act does not mandate coverage for all employees.Â  Section 42-1-360 specifies that the Act excludes \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1) Casual employees, as defined in Â§ 42-1-130, and Federal employees in this State;\r\n\t(2) Any person who has regularly employed in service less than four employees in the same business within the State or who had a total annual payroll during the previous calendar year of less than three thousand dollars regardless of the number of persons employed during that period;\r\n\t(3) Textile Hall Corporation, an eleemosynary corporation whose principal object is the organizing and production of the Southern Textile Exposition;\r\n\t(4) State and county fair associations; unless any such employer voluntarily elects to be bound by this Title, as provided by Â§ 42-1-380.\r\n\t(5) Agricultural employees; unless the agricultural employer voluntarily elects to be bound by this Title, as provided by Â§ 42-1-380.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-360 (Supp. 2006); see also Nolan v. National Sales Co., Inc., 294 S.C. 371, 372, 364 S.E.2d 752, 753 (1988) (holding an employer must have at least four employees in the state to be subject to provisions of South Carolinas Workersâ€™ Compensation Act).\r\nAddressing the minimum number requirement in exemption provisions like section 42-1-306(2), Professor Larson inculcates:\r\n\r\n\tThe controlling number of employees is determined in light of the employerâ€™s established mode or plan in the operation of its business.Â  If it regularly employs the requisite number, the employer remains covered although the number employed falls temporarily below the minimum.Â  Ordinarily only such employees as would themselves be subject to the act are included in the count.Â  Details of interpretation should be controlled by the underlying purpose of the exemption, which is to avoid administrative inconvenience to very small employers.\r\n\tThe most common problem under the usual wording of statutes conferring this type of exemption is the question of whether the employer â€œregularlyâ€ employs more than the minimum number.Â  Since the practical effect of the numerical boundary is normally to determine whether compensation insurance is compulsory, an employer cannot be allowed to oscillate between coverage and exemption as its labor force exceeds or falls below the minimum from day to day.Â  Therefore, if an employer has once regularly employed enough men to come under the act, it remains there even when the number employed temporarily falls below the minimum.Â  The term â€œregularly employedâ€ has been construed to embrace regularly-employed part-time as well as full-time workers.Â  In all these cases, the fact that the number working at the exact time of injury was below the minimum is of course immaterial. . . .\r\n\tThe question whether a particular employee should be disregarded for numerical-minimum purposes is very similar to the question whether he or she is a casual employee.Â  It has been said that the two concepts are the same, and observation which, if true, would somewhat simplify the classification problem.Â  As in the casual employment definition, both duration and regularity of recurrence are important factors.Â  Thus, if the minimum number is exceeded on only eight of the one hundred and four days preceding the accident, the employer is not regularly employing the minimum.Â  But if the number exceeds the minimum on seventeen out of twenty-seven days in the course of a construction job, the employer is covered. . . .Â  It is the established mode or plan of operation of the business that is decisive.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4 Larson, Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§Â§ 74.01-02 (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nA.&nbsp; â€œRegularly Employedâ€\r\nIn Harding v. Plumley, we applied section 42-1-360 (2) to a set of facts similar to those in the instant case.Â  329 S.C. at 584, 496 S.E.2d at 31. Â Plumley owned a construction company and hired Harding as a general laborer.Â  Id. at 582, 496 S.E.2d at 30.Â  Harding was injured on his first and only day on the job.Â  Id.Â  The hearing commissioner found the relevant time period for determining the number of regularly employed workers ran from two months before through two months after the accident, which corresponded to the period of construction.Â  Id. at 584, 496 S.E.2d at 31. Â We concluded Plumley had â€œat the most, two regularly employed laborersâ€ who worked during the relevant time period and were paid on an almost weekly basis.Â  Id. at 586, 496 S.E.2d at 33.Â  Two other laborers worked on occasion and received only one or two paychecks.Â  Id.Â  Assuming Hardingâ€™s one day on the job amounted to regular employment, a fourth employee was still needed to meet jurisdictional requirements under section 42-1-360.Â  Id. at 587, 496 S.E.2d at 33.Â  \r\n \r\nTurning to the case sub judice, we focus on the definition of â€œregularly employed.â€Â  As noted in Harding, section 42-1-360 does not define the term â€œregularly employed.â€ 329 S.C. at 584, 496 S.E.2d at 31.Â  When faced with an undefined statutory term, the court must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Branch v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 405, 409-10, 532 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2000); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 622, 611 S.E.2d 297, 302 (Ct. App. 2005); University of Southern California v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 276, 617 S.E.2d 135, 138 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Santee Cooper Resort v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 298 S.C. 179, 184, 379 S.E.2d 119, 122 (1989) (â€œWords used in a statute should be taken in their ordinary and popular significance unless there is something in the statute requiring a different interpretation.â€). Â â€œThe terms must be construed in context and their meaning determined by looking at the other terms used in the statute.â€ Â Hinton v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole and Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 332-33, 592 S.E.2d 335, 338 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nCourts should consider not merely the language of the particular clause being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 16, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997); see also State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 152, 588 S.E.2d 105, 110 (2003) (â€œ[T]he court should not consider the particular clause being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.â€); Stephen v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 340, 478 S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding statutory provisions should be given reasonable and practical construction consistent with purpose and policy of entire act).Â  \r\n \r\nDictionaries can be helpful tools during the initial stages of legal research for the purpose of defining statutory terms. Â Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for City of Beaufort, 346 S.C. 401, 409, 552 S.E.2d 42, 46 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The term â€œregularlyâ€ means â€œ[a]t fixed and certain intervals, regular in point of time.Â  In accordance with some consistent or periodical rule or practice.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, 1286 (6th ed. 1990).Â  â€œRegularâ€ is defined as â€œusual, customary, normal or general.â€Â  Id. at 1285. \r\n \r\nIn the context of construing the statute, the term â€œregularâ€ is often juxtaposed with the term â€œcasual.â€ Â 4 Larson, Workersâ€™Compensation Â§Â§ 74.01-02 (â€œIt has been said that the two concepts are the same . . . in the casual employment definition, both duration and regularity of recurrence are important factors.â€).Â  Where employment cannot be characterized as permanent or periodically regular, but occurs by chance, or with the intention and understanding on the part of both employer and employee that it shall not be continuous, it is casual. Â Smith v. Coastal Tire and Auto Service 263 S.C. 77, 81, 207 S.E.2d 810, 812 (1974).Â  â€œEmployment is casual when not permanent or periodically regular but occasional or by chance and not in the usual course of the employers trade or business.â€Â  Singleton v. J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., Inc., 533 F. Supp. 887, 892 (D.C.S.C. 1982) affâ€™d Singleton v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 1011 (4th Cir. (1984); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2006) (excluding â€œa person whose employment is both casual and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of his employerâ€ from the definition of employee under the Act).Â  \r\n \r\nBecause South Carolina workersâ€™ compensation law is fashioned after North Carolinaâ€™s statute, our courts often rely on North Carolina precedent for guidance in interpreting the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 343 S.C. 102, 117-118, 538 S.E.2d 276, 284 (Ct. App. 2000) affâ€™d 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002) (citing Spoone v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, 309 S.C. 432, 424 S.E.2d 489 (1992); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 340, 478 S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996) (decisions of North Carolina courts interpreting that stateâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation statute are entitled to weight when South Carolina courts interpret South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation law).Â  \r\n \r\nNorth Carolina courts have interpreted â€œregularly employedâ€ as â€œemployment of the same number of persons throughout the period with some constancy.â€Â  Grouse v. DRB Baseball Management, Inc., 465 S.E.2d 568, 570 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996) (citing Patterson v. L.M. Parker Co., 162 S.E.2d 571, 575 (1968)).Â  The court explained the purpose of the Act would not be accomplished â€œby making it applicable to an employer who may have had, in the total number of persons entering and leaving his service during the period, more than the minimum number required by the Act.â€Â  Patterson, 162 S.E.2d at 575. \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Relevant Time Period\r\nA priori, we must identify the relevant time period for determining whether a minimum number of persons were employed throughout the period with some constancy.Â  This task is particularly difficult for employment in which workers come and go due to the nature and type of work they perform.\r\nAs Professor Larson edifies, the employerâ€™s established mode or plan of operation dictates, to a large extent, the relevant time period, and both duration and regularity of occurrence are important factors.Â  In Harding, the time roughly corresponding to the duration of the construction project constituted the relevant period.Â  Harding v. Plumley, 329 S.C. 580, 584, 496 S.E.2d 29, 31 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Because only two employees worked with any constancy for the duration of that period, the employer was not required to provide Workersâ€™ Compensation coverage. Â Id. at 587, 496 S.E.2d at 31.\r\nIn Patterson, the North Carolina Supreme Court looked at the number employed six weeks prior to the claimantâ€™s injury and determined it was less than the jurisdictional minimum.Â  Patterson v. L.M. Parker Co., 162 S.E.2d 571, 574 (1968).Â  The court concluded the minimum number was not employed with sufficient constancy or regularity during that time to bring the employer under the provisions of the Act.Â  Id. Â \r\nIn Durham v. McLamb, an employer hired four carpenters to work on a construction project in December, 1979.Â  296 S.E.2d 3, 5 (N.C. Ct. App. 1982).Â  The claimant was injured on December 20, 1979. Â Id. at 4. Â All the workers were discharged in January 1980 because the employer could no longer pay them.Â  Id. at 5.Â  The employer argued he was exempt from the Act because during the week claimant was injured, only three workers were on the job. Â Id. at 7. Â The court reasoned â€œthe number of workers on the job site on the date of the injury, standing alone, is not determinative of the issue. Â If the defendant had four or more â€œregularly employedâ€ employees, the fact that he fell below the minimum requirement on the actual date of injury would not preclude coverage.â€Â  Id.Â  The four employees were deemed full-time and â€œregularly employedâ€ until their discharge in early January, 1980. Â Id. Â â€œ[A]lthough they worked irregular days and hours, their employment extended over a period of some four weeks, during which they worked, not by chance or for a particular occasion, but according to a definite employment at hourly wages which were paid at the end of each week worked.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals revisited this issue in Grouse v. DRB Baseball Management, Inc., 465 S.E.2d 568, 570 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996).Â  The court found evidence DRB employed â€œwith some constancyâ€ at least four people during the year the claimant was injured, even though only three regularly employed workers were present on the day of the injury.Â  Id. at 571.Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn the case at bar, Tickle left the Finish Company and engaged in itinerant projects to earn income while he was developing his business plan.Â  His mode of operation was â€œproject to project.â€ Â He claimed he initially attempted to form a partnership with the workers. Â Nevertheless, he paid the workers hourly wages, and that arrangement persisted throughout the period. Â \r\nOnce Claimant commenced work in the spring of 2003, he worked continuously until the day of his accident, a period of approximately four to six weeks.Â  Work on Tickleâ€™s projects subsided after Claimant was injured and resumed after Tickle obtained a business license and workersâ€™ compensation insurance.\r\n \r\nWe determine the relevant time period for ascertaining whether Tickle regularly employed four or more employees with some constancy began when Claimant started working for Tickle on the beach chairs project.Â  The period terminated shortly after Claimantâ€™s injury, when Tickle ceased operating until he officially opened his business.\r\nDuring the relevant period, the workers undertook three projects.Â  Two people worked on the first project painting beach chairs.Â  Three people worked on each of the two houses.Â  Allegedly, a fourth employee continued to finish up work on the Garrett house while the others moved on to the next project.Â  Claimant and Alle worked every weekday and some weekends after Tickle hired them; they expected their employment to continue.\r\n \r\nTickle disavowed any employment relationship with the workers, professing instead to have formed a business partnership with them.Â  The record provides little to substantiate Tickleâ€™s assertion.Â  Alternatively, Tickle admitted he hired the workers on a project-by-project basis, because he was just starting up his painting business.\r\nWe conclude Claimant and Alle were Tickleâ€™s employees and not business partners.Â  In addition, they were â€œregularly employedâ€ workers during the relevant period.Â  On the other hand, the greater weight of evidence indicates Franklin was not regularly employed by Tickle.Â  Testimony about the duration of his employment was conflicting and inconclusive.Â  Tickle disclaimed any knowledge that Franklin worked on any of the projects, though he was aware another individual might have worked on the Hewitt project. Â Moreover, Beth Garrett never observed more than three workers painting her house.Â  Even if Victor worked for Tickle at the same time, but in another location, Claimant still fails to demonstrate Tickle regularly employed at least four workers with some constancy during the relevant period. Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Statutory Employees \r\n\r\nClaimant argues that three individuals were Tickleâ€™s statutory employees under section 42-1-400 and should be counted to meet the jurisdictional requirement of four or more regular employees.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nThe question of whether a worker is a statutory employee is jurisdictional and is therefore a question of law for the court.Â  Riden v. Kemet Electronics Corp., 313 S.C. 261, 263, 437 S.E.2d 156, 157 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Â Â Bigham v. Nassau Recycle Corp., 285 S.C. 200, 328 S.E.2d 663 (Ct. App. 1985). Â \r\nSection 42-1-400 defines an ownerâ€™s obligation to provide workersâ€™ compensation coverage for the workmen of his subcontractor:\r\n\r\n\tWhen any person, in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 and 42-1-430 referred to as â€œowner,â€ undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 referred to as â€œsubcontractorâ€) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Title which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C.Â  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (Supp. 2006).\r\nIn Ost v. Integrated Prod., Inc.[4], the supreme court first addressed whether statutory employees of a subcontractor may be counted toward the number of employees required to bring the general contractor within the Act.Â  296 S.C. 241, 371 S.E.2d 796 (1988).Â  Integrated was a Georgia corporation employing three pilots who regularly flew into South Carolina in the course and scope of their employment. Â Id. at 243, 371 S.E.2d at 797. Â Integrated contracted with National Sales Company, a Georgia corporation, to provide personnel to sell Integratedâ€™s yarn products in South Carolina. Â Id.Â  Neither the pilots nor the sales personnel were residents of South Carolina, but \r\nall traveled into South Carolina regularly in the course of their employment.Â  \r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nOst, a pilot for Integrated, was killed in an airplane crash near Greenville, South Carolina.Â  Id. at 242-43, 371 S.E.2d at 797.Â  The circuit court upheld a Workersâ€™ Compensation award of death benefits and Integrated appealed, arguing it had less than four employees working in South Carolina and was exempt from the Act under S.C. Code section 42-1-360(2). Â Id. at 242, 371 S.E.2d at 797.Â  Ost asserted the employees of National Sales, Integratedâ€™s subcontractor, were statutory employees and should be counted for purposes of meeting the jurisdictional requirement. Â Id.\r\nThe court analyzed three South Carolina cases interpreting section 42-1-400 â€œto determine whether employees of a secondary employer constitute statutory employees of the principal employer.â€Â  Ost, 296 S.C. at 244, 371 S.E.2d at 798.\r\n\r\n\tIn the leading case, Marchbanks v. Duke Power Company, 190 S.C. 336, 2 S.E.2d 825 (1939), this Court held that when a person performs work which is part of the trade or business of the principal, the employees of the person will be considered statutory employees of the principal. Â We concluded that a person who was injured while painting the power companyâ€™s pole was engaged in the â€˜trade, business or occupationâ€™ of the power company because the activity was an important part of the power companyâ€™s trade or business.\r\n\tLikewise, in Boseman v. Pacific Mills, 193 S.C. 479, 8 S.E.2d 878 (1940), we held that when an activity performed by the employees of a subcontractor is necessary, or essential to, or an integral part of, the operation of the principal employerâ€™s business, the employees of the subcontractor constitute the statutory employees of the principal employer.Â  There, an employee of the subcontractor, who was painting a water tank at a mill, was killed when the tank caught fire and exploded. Â Our court reasoned that the water tank, which provided essential protection to the mill against fires, was an integral part of the trade or business of the mill as to subject it to liability for the death of Boseman.\r\n\tThis court espoused another test to determine whether an employee of a subcontractor was a statutory employee in\r\n\tBridges v. Wyandotte Worsted Company, 243 S.C. 1, 132 S.E.2d 18 (1963). Â In \r\n\tBridges, the defendant contracted with an electric company, plaintiffâ€™s employer, to repair or replace the transmission line owned by the defendant and located on his property. Â The lines had been replaced on a previous occasion, and customarily maintained by a qualified crew regularly employed by the defendant. Â We concluded that the repair or replacement of the transmission lines was a part of the work ordinarily and customarily performed by the employees of the defendant in the prosecution of the defendantâ€™s business. Â Finding the repair of the transmission lines was a part of the defendantâ€™s trade or business, we held that the defendant was liable for the subcontractorâ€™s employeesâ€™ injuries.\r\n\r\nId. at 245, 371 S.E.2d at 798-99.\r\nThus, a three-part test emerged to ascertain whether employees of a subcontractor are statutory employees of the general contractor. Â Id. at 246-47, 371 S.E.2d at 799. Â â€œThis statutory requirement has been construed to include activities that: (1) are an important part of the trade or business of the employer, (2) are a necessary, essential, and integral part of the business of the employer, or (3) have been previously performed by employees of the employer.â€Â  Glass v. Dow Chemical Co., 325 S.C. 198, 201, 482 S.E.2d 49, 50-51 (1997) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (1976)); Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 315 S.C. 329, 337, 433 S.E.2d 890, 894 (Ct. App. 1993), vacated on other grounds, 319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995)). Â â€œOnly one of these tests must be met in order for a subcontractorâ€™s employees to be considered the statutory employees of the owner.â€ Â Glass, 325 S.C. at 201, 482 S.E.2d at 51 (citing Woodard, 315 S.C. at 337, 433 S.E.2d at 894). Â â€œSince no easily applied formula can be laid down for determining whether work in a particular case meets these tests, each case must be decided on its own facts.â€ Â Id. (citing Ost, 296 S.C. at 244, 371 S.E.2d at 798); see also Olmstead v. Shakespeare, 354 S.C. 421, 581 S.E.2d 483 (2003); Meyer v. Piggly Wiggly No. 24, Inc., 331 S.C. 261, 500 S.E.2d 190 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n \r\nThe Ost court concluded National Salesâ€™ employees were statutory employees of Integrated and held those employees may be included to satisfy the four person jurisdictional requirement of Section 42-1-360(2). Â Ost, 296 S.C. at 247, 371 S.E.2d at 799. Â In reaching this conclusion the court considered the underlying purpose of the Act:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIt was evidently realized by the General Assembly that it would not be fair to relieve the owner of compensation to employees doing work which was part of his trade or business by permitting such owner to sublet or subcontract some part of said work. Â Doubtless in many instances such contractor would be financially irresponsible, or the number of employees under him would be so small, as in this case, that such contractor would not be required under the Act to carry compensation insurance. Â It was therefore, provided under the first paragraph that where such work in which the employee was engaged was a part of the ownerâ€™s trade or business, the owner would be responsible in compensation to all employees doing such work, whether employees of an independent contractor or not.\r\n\r\nId. at 247, 371 S.E.2d at 800.\r\nIn Harding, Plumley engaged two subcontractors during the relevant time period to perform certain parts of the construction.Â  329 S.C. at 585, 496 S.E.2d at 32.Â  Harding argued the subcontractorsâ€™ two workers were statutory employees according to section 42-1-400 of the South Carolina Code of Laws and should be counted in determining whether Plumley was exempt under provision 42-1-360(2).Â  Id.Â  The court considered Ost in addressing the claimantâ€™s argument.Â  We noted one of Plumleyâ€™s subcontractors was paid only once and the other, twice, during the relevant time period.Â  In contrast, the statutory employees in Ost â€œregularlyâ€ traveled into South Carolina as part of their employment.Â  Even assuming Plumleyâ€™s subcontractorsâ€™ workers were statutory employees, we held the record did not support a conclusion that Plumley employed the â€œsame number of persons through the period with some constancy.â€ Â Id. at 587, 496 S.E.2d at 33 (citing Patterson v. L.M. Parker Co., 162 S.E.2d 571, 575 (N.C. 1968).Â  \r\n \r\nHere, Claimant asserted that three individualsâ€”Rene, Fernando Lucas, and Claudio Gomezâ€”were statutory employees of Tickle and should be counted toward the jurisdictional minimum.Â  Tickle disclosed that he hired Rene to finish up work after Claimantâ€™s accident.Â  He then explained Fernando Lucas was a finisher with whom he subcontracted to â€œdo a couple of patches.â€Â  Tickle paid Lucas $120.00 on April 10, 2003, $40.00 on May 2, 2003, and $970.00 on July 31, 2003.Â  Tickle issued a $750.00 check to Claudio Gomez on July 25, 2003.[5]Â  The record substantiates that Fernando Lucas performed work that was an important part of Tickleâ€™s painting business and a necessary and integral part of Tickleâ€™s trade.Â  See Ost, 296 S.C. at 244, 371 S.E.2d at 798.Â  However, without evidence describing the work Rene and Gomez performed, we cannot determine whether they were Tickleâ€™s statutory employees under section 42-1-400 and the test in Ost.Â  Even assuming the three were all statutory employees, our reasoning in Harding is equally applicable in addressing whether they should be counted toward the jurisdictional minimum.Â  Like the subcontractorsâ€™ workers in Harding, the statutory employees here did not work for Tickle in a regular, recurring capacity.Â  Although Tickle may have employed some additional workers or statutory employees, the record fails to support the conclusion that Tickle employed â€œthe same number of persons throughout the period with some constancy.â€ Â Harding v. Plumley, 329 S.C. at 587, 496 S.E.2d at 33.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTo promote the purpose of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, the statute is to be construed liberally for the protection of the injured worker, with jurisdictional doubts generally resolved in favor of inclusion.Â  We are, nevertheless, constrained to interpret the Act as it is written and do not have the power to expand its scope.Â \r\n \r\nThe statutory language unequivocally exempts employers who do not regularly employ four or more employees.Â  We adopt the definition of â€œregularly employedâ€ as employment of the same number of persons with some constancy throughout a relevant time period.Â  We rule the relevant time period should be identified by considering (1) the employerâ€™s established mode of operation; (2) whether the employer generally employs the jurisdictional number at any time during his operation, and (3) the period during which employment is definite and recurrent rather than occasional, sporadic, or indefinite.Â \r\n \r\nTaking our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we conclude Tickle regularly employed less than four workers during the identified relevant time period.Â  Tickle was exempt from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act when Claimant sustained his injury.Â  The Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission did not have jurisdiction to consider his claim.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] This witness is referred to in the Briefs on Appeal as Alle Hernandez.Â  However, at the hearing the witness said his name was Alle Hernandez Alverez.Â  For the sake of clarity we will refer to him as â€œAlle.â€Â  Additionally, Appellantâ€™s Brief refers to Reneâ€™ Alverez, as the worker who finished up after Claimant was injured.Â  However, Tickle declared the workerâ€™s name was Reneâ€™ Everest.Â  Assuming this is the same individual, we will refer to him as â€œRene.â€\r\n[3] The second painting job is confusingly referred to as the Hewitt house in some parts of the record and as the Pitts house in other parts.Â  For clarity we refer to the second house as the Hewitt house. \r\n \r\n[4] The court distinguished Nolan v. National Sales, 294 S.C. 371, 364 S.E.2d 752 (1988) in its analysis in Ost.Â  In Nolan, the claimant, a National Sales employee, attempted to amalgamate Integratedâ€™s pilots as Nationalâ€™s statutory employees in order to meet the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Actâ€™s jurisdictional requirement.Â  The Court of Appeals held Nolanâ€™s assertion was not preserved and without merit.Â  The supreme court affirmed and suggested its agreement with the Court of Appeals that National Sales, as the subcontractor of Integrated, could not count Integratedâ€™s employees to meet the jurisdictional requirement.\r\n \r\n[5]Â  We are unable to identify from the handwriting on this check the purpose of its issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4254","title":"Ecclesiastes Production Ministries v.

Â Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 611 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Hinkle v. Natâ€™l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003); Huffines Co. v. Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 187, 617 S.E.2d 125, 129 (Ct. App. 2005); Lingard v. Carolina By-Products, 361 S.C. 442, 446, 605 S.E.2d 545, 547 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The trial court must deny such a motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt. Â Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999); Collins Entertainment, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 611 S.E.2d 262 (Ct. App. 2005); Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 860 (Ct. App. 2001). Â If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied. Â Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003); Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995); Huffines at 187, 617 S.E.2d at 129.\r\nA motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and may be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability. Â Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346, 358, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972).Â  â€œWhen the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.â€ Â Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476-77, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999); accord Sims, at 714, 541 S.E.2d at 860; R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l. Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 540 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2000). Â â€œThe issue must be submitted to the jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.â€Â  Small v. Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 461, 494 S.E.2d 835, 841 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, if the evidence taken as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the case must be submitted to the jury. Â Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998); Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 426, 489 S.E.2d 223, 223 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Heyward v. Christmas, 352 S.C. 298, 573 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 2002) (if the evidence is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the court may not grant a directed verdict).\r\nâ€œWhen considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.â€ Â Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002); accord Pond Place Partners v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002); Boddie-Noell Props., Inc. v. 42 Magnolia Pâ€™ship, 344 S.C. 474, 482, 544 S.E.2d 279, 283 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d as modified by 352 S.C. 437, 574 S.E.2d 726 (2002). Â â€œThe issue must be submitted to the jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.â€Â  Huffines, at 188, 617 S.E.2d at 129-30 (citing Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997)). Â However, this rule does not authorize the jury to the submission of speculative, theoretical, or hypothetical views. Â Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 461, 494 S.E.2d 835, 842 (Ct. App. 1997). Â Our courts have recognized that when only one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for the court to determine. Â Bell v. Bank of Abbeville, 211 S.C. 167, 173, 44 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1947); Small, 329 S.C. at 461, 494 S.E.2d at 841-42. Â â€œA corollary of this rule is that verdicts may not be permitted to rest upon surmise, conjecture or speculation.â€ Â Hanahan, 326 S.C. at 149, 485 S.E.2d at 908; Small, 329 S.C. at 461, 494 S.E.2d at 841-42. Â This does not mean the trial court should ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party. Â Long v. Norris &amp; Assocs., Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 568, 538 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2000); Love v. Gamble, 316 S.C. 203, 208, 448 S.E.2d 876, 879 (Ct. App. 1994). Â In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the court is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence. Â Pond Place Partners, Inc., 351 S.C. at 15, 567 S.E.2d at 888.\r\nAn appellate court will reverse only where there is no evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s ruling, or where the ruling was controlled by an error of law. Â Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Public Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005); Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999); Abu-Shawareb v. S.C. State Univ., 364 S.C. 358, 613 S.E.2d 757 (Ct. App. 2005); Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000). Â Essentially, this court must resolve whether it would be reasonably conceivable to have a verdict for a party opposing the motion under the facts as liberally construed in the opposing partyâ€™s favor. Â Harvey, 350 S.C. at 309, 566 S.E.2d at 532; Hanahan, 326 S.C. at 149, 485 S.E.2d at 908.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEPM argues the trial judge erred in granting Outparcelâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the ground that the mutual release granted by EPM and JDL to one another had the effect of releasing Outparcel as well.Â  EPM avers that viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the law of contract construction does not allow for finding that the Settlement Agreement provides for Outparcelâ€™s release from EPMâ€™s third-party claim.Â  We agree.\r\nA. The Extant Precedent\r\n1.Â  Settlement Agreements\r\nThe term â€œreleaseâ€ has been defined as the â€œrelinquishment, concession, or giving up of a right, claim, or privilege, by the person in whom it exists or to whom it accrues, to the person against whom it might have been demanded or enforced.â€Â  76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 2 (1994).Â  A release is an agreement providing that a duty owed to the maker of the release is discharged immediately.Â  Id.; see also Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1315-16 (6th ed. 1990) (a release is the act of giving up a right or claim to the person against whom it could have been enforced).Â  Whether a particular agreement constitutes a release is to be determined from the intent of the parties.Â  Id.\r\nUnder the common law, the release of one of multiple joint tortfeasors, unavoidably resulted in the release of all. Bartholomew v. McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 179 S.E.2d 912 (1971).Â  In response to the obvious quandaries caused by this rule, South Carolina jurisprudence adopted documents in lieu of a general release:Â  (1) a covenant not to sue; and (2) a covenant not to execute.Â  A covenant not to sue was recognized and approved in Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 156 S.E.2d 759 (1967).Â  A covenant not to execute received the imprimatur and approbation of our supreme court in Poston by Poston v. Barnes, 294 S.C. 261, 363 S.E.2d 888 (1987).\r\nIn Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1995), this court discussed the genesis of the covenant not to sue:\r\n\r\n\tAt common law, a valid release of one joint tort-feasor was usually a release of all the joint wrongdoers and was a bar to a suit against any of them for the same wrong.Â  At the base of this rule was the theory that there could be but one compensation for the joint wrong.Â  If the injured party was paid by one of the wrongdoers for the injury he had suffered, each wrongdoer being responsible for the whole damage, his cause of action was satisfied in exchange for a release, and he could not proceed against the others.Â  Thus a release of one joint wrongdoer released all.Â  But when the consideration received for the release was not full compensation for the injury, the purpose for the harsh rule did not exist.Â  To allow for this, the covenant not to sue was developed.\r\n\r\nAckerman, 318 S.C. at 146-47, 456 S.E.2d at 413.Â  Technically, in the case of a release, there is an immediate discharge; whereas, in the case of a covenant not to sue, there is merely an agreement not to prosecute a suit.Â  66 Am. Jur. 2d Release Â§ 2 (1973).Â  \r\n \r\nThe differences between a covenant not to sue and a covenant not to execute were succinctly explained in Poston:\r\n\r\n\tOther jurisdictions hold that a Covenant Not To Execute is not a satisfaction or a release and that its legal effect is similar to that of a Covenant Not To Sue because it does not operate to release other joint tortfeasors. Â A Covenant Not To Execute is a promise not to enforce a right of action or execute a judgment when one had such a right at the time of entering into the agreement. Â A Covenant Not to Sue and a Covenant Not to Execute are so closely akin that a major distinguishing factor is that the latter is normally executed when a settlement occurs after the filing of a lawsuit, while the former is entered into before a lawsuit is filed. Â In South Carolina when a Covenant Not To Sue has been entered into, usually the covenanting tortfeasor is no longer a party to the litigation.\r\n\tWe are cognizant that litigants are free to devise a settlement agreement in any manner that does not contravene public policy or the law. Â In fact, this Court encourages such compromise agreements because they avoid costly litigation and delay to an injured party. Â However, these settlement agreements must be carefully scrutinized in order to determine their efficiency and impact upon the integrity of the judicial process.\r\n\r\nPoston, 294 S.C. at 263-64, 363 S.E.2d at 889-90 (citations omitted).\r\nBartholomew v. McCartha addressed the efficacy of a settlement agreementâ€™s release as to the liability of a third-party and manifestly replaced â€œthe ancient common-law rule, that regardless of the intention of the parties, the release of one joint tort-feasor releases all.â€Â  255 S.C. 489, 491, 179 S.E.2d 912, 913 (1971) (quoting Mickle v. Blackmond, 252 S.C. 202, 224, 166 S.E.2d 173, 182 (1969)).Â  In Bartholomew the plaintiff was involved in a car crash with two other vehicles.Â  After the victim settled out of court with one of the two tortfeasor defendants, the remaining defendant claimed the other partiesâ€™ agreement released him from liability as well.Â  Declining to adopt the traditional common-law rule that the release of one joint tortfeasor discharged all others, the court held:\r\n\r\n\tBeing untrammeled by the ancient rule which, in our view, tends to stifle settlements, defeat the intention of parties and extol technicality, we adopt the view that the release of one tort-feasor does not release others who wrongfully contributed to plaintiffâ€™s injuries unless this was the intention of the parties, or unless plaintiff has, in fact, received full compensation amounting to a satisfaction. Â It, therefore, becomes unnecessary for us to determine whether the instrument involved here is a release rather than a covenant.\r\n\r\nBartholomew at 492, 179 S.E.2d at 914.\r\nFinding no merit to the appellantsâ€™ contention that the circuit court erred in finding the plaintiffâ€™s release of another defendant did not, as a matter of law, operate to exonerate the appellants from liability, in Scott by McClure v. Fruehauf Corp., 302 S.C. 364, 396 S.E.2d 354 (1990), the South Carolina Supreme Court enunciated:\r\n\r\n\tThe release of one tortfeasor does not constitute a release of others who contributed to the plaintiffâ€™s injuries unless the parties intended such a release or the plaintiff received full satisfaction. Â Bartholomew v. McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 179 S.E.2d 912 (1971). Â The release here evidences no intent to release others from liability and in fact contemplates further litigation against other tortfeasors to fully compensate [the plaintiff].\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 368, 396 S.E.2d at 356.\r\nIn Loydâ€™s Inc. by Richardson Const. Co. of Columbia, S.C., Inc. v. Good, 306 S.C. 450, 412 S.E.2d 441, (Ct. App. 1991), a release was executed between a subcontractor and pond owner who had suffered siltation damage.Â  The agreement provided full satisfaction of the pond ownerâ€™s claims, and therefore had the efficacy of releasing the general contractor and upstream property owner from liability as well.Â  This court instructed:\r\n\r\n\t[B]efore the effective date of the [act creating a right of contribution of joint tortfeasors], the law was clear that the release of one tortfeasor served to release others who wrongfully contributed to the plaintiffâ€™s injuries only if the injured party and released party intended that result, or the injured party in fact received full compensation for his injuries amounting to a satisfaction. Â Following this reasoning, a covenant not to sue or a release which is not effective as a full release of all tortfeasors is a satisfaction â€œpro tantoâ€ and reduces the amount of damages recoverable against the nonsettling tortfeasors by the amount of the consideration for the release.\r\n\r\nId. at Â 454, 412 S.E.2d at 444 (internal citations omitted).\r\nAfter executing a release with other persons involved in their automobile accident, in Bowers v. South Carolina Dept. of Trans., 360 S.C. 149, 600 S.E.2d 543 (Ct. App. 2004), an injured motorist and her parents filed suit against the South Carolina Department of Transportation alleging its negligence in roadway maintenance contributed to the collision.Â  Looking to the language of the release document, the Court of Appeals upheld the circuit courtâ€™s award of summary judgment.Â  The court based its determination on both prongs of Bartholomew, and concluded Â that, under the terms of the release, the parties received full compensation and intended that all claims for injuries would be relinquished: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe terms of the Release do not evince an intent to limit its scope to any specifically identified parties. Â Rather, the Release is general and all encompassing in its scope. Â It clearly states that the Appellants released the tort-feasor â€œand all other persons, firms or corporations liable, or who might be claimed to be liable.â€ Â This language is a clear, explicit, and unequivocal indication of the partiesâ€™ intent that\r\n\tall claims arising from the accident-now and in the future-are barred under the terms of the Release. Â Had Appellants intended a contrary result and desired to limit the operation of the Release to named persons only, the terms of the Release could have been easily tailored to that end. Â We are constrained by the plain, unambiguous language of the Release to find that Appellantsâ€™ claims against SCDOT fall within the terms of the Release.\r\n\tThis result is also compelled under the second prong of \r\n\tBartholomew. The Release clearly and unequivocally contemplates that the respective settlement payments to Appellants constituted a â€œfull compensation amounting to a satisfaction.â€\r\n\tAppellants, however, argue that â€œdamages to be awarded for injury and resulting pain and suffering cannot be determined with mathematical precisionâ€ and this determination is, therefore, always â€œan issue of fact.â€ Â They essentially argue that full compensation is always a function of the juryâ€™s discretion, rendering summary judgment unavailable. While we agree that damages, especially non-pecuniary damages, in a personal injury claim are difficult to ascertain in light of the broad discretion accorded the trier of fact, Appellants misconstrue the precise issue before us. Â The issue is not determining the exact amount (assuming liability) a jury would award. Instead, the issue is â€œfull compensation amounting to a satisfaction.â€ Â Id. at 491, 179 S.E.2d at 913 (emphasis added).\r\n\tA â€œsatisfactionâ€ is generally defined as â€œ[t]he discharge of an obligation by paying a party what is due to himâ€ or â€œ[t]he performance of a substituted obligation in return for the discharge of the original obligation.â€ \r\n\tBlackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1342 (6th ed. 1990). Â In cases involving a disputed or liquidated claim arising in contract or tort, the parties will reach an â€œaccordâ€ whereby one of the parties agrees to accept as â€œsatisfactionâ€ of the disputed claim some performance or undertaking different from that which he considers himself entitled. Â See\r\n\tSouth Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kelly, 345 S.C. 232, 239, 547 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting that â€œ[a]n accord and satisfaction occurs when there is (1) an agreement to accept in discharge of an obligation something different from that which the creditor is claiming or is entitled to receive; and (2) payment of the consideration expressed in the new agreement.â€) (quoting \r\n\tTremont Constr. Co. v. Dunlap, 310 S.C. 180, 182, 425 S.E.2d 792, 793 (Ct. App. 1992); \r\n\tMercury Marine Div. v. Costas, 288 S.C. 383, 386, 342 S.E.2d 632, 633 (Ct. App. 1986)). Indeed, parties regularly reach compromise settlements for a variety of reasons, including the vagaries and unpredictability of litigation and the desire for finality. Where, as here, a party accepts â€œa full and final compromise adjustment and settlement of any and all claims,â€ such amounts to a Bartholomew satisfaction, thereby extending the preclusive effect of the release to nonparties to the instrument.\r\n\r\nBowers v. Dept. of Transp., 360 S.C. 149, 154-55, 600 S.E.2d 543, 545-46 (Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis in original).\r\n2. Contract Interpretation\r\nA release is a contract and contract principles of law should be used to determine what the parties intended.Â  See Bowers v. Dept. of Transp., 360 S.C. 149, 153, 600 S.E.2d 543, 545 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating â€œThe Release is a contractâ€ and applying South Carolinaâ€™s rules of contract construction); see also Lowery v. Callahan, 210 S.C. 300, 300, 42 S.E.2d 457, 458 (1947) (noting that the â€œsame principles of adequacy of consideration which apply to other contracts, govern as to releasesâ€); Hyman v. Ford Motor Co., 142 F. Supp. 2d 735 (D.S.C. 2001) (applying South Carolina contract law principles to determine validity of a release); 18 S.C. Jur. Release Â§ 2 (2003) (â€œBecause a release is a contract, principles of law applicable to contracts generally are also applicable to releases.â€); 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 2 (1994) (stating that a release is contractual in nature). \r\n \r\nâ€œIn construing a contract, the primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.â€Â  Southern Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 349 S.C. 77, 80-81, 562 S.E.2d 482, 484-85&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002); accordÂ  D.A. Davis Constr. Co., Inc. v.

Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 234 S.C. 182, 188, 107 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1958).\r\nThe partiesâ€™ intention must, in the first instance, be derived from the language of the contract.Â  Schulmeyer v.

Service Merch. Co., 297 S.C. 123, 375 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  To discover the intention of a contract, the court must first look to its languageâ€”if the language is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, it alone determines the documentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Superior Auto.

Brady, 222 S.C. 242, 72 S.E.2d 193 (1952) the South Carolina Supreme Court asseverated:\r\n\r\n\tIt is fundamental that in the construction of the language of a [contract], it is proper to read together the different provisions therein dealing with the same subject matter, and where possible, all the language used should be given a reasonable meaning.\r\n\tAgreements should be liberally construed so as to give them effect and carry out the intention of the parties.Â  In arriving at the intention of the parties to a lease, the subject matter, the surrounding circumstances, the situation of the parties, and the object in view and intended to be accomplished by the parties at the time, are to be regarded, and the lease construed as a whole.Â  Different provisions dealing with the same subject matter are to be read together.\r\n\r\nId. at 246-47, 72 S.E.2d at 195.  \r\nIf a contractâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, no construction is required and its language determines the instrumentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Jordan v. Security Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993); Blakeley at 72, 221 S.E.2d at 769.Â  â€œWhere an agreement is clear and capable of legal interpretation, the courts only function is to interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it.â€Â  Ellie at 93, 594 S.E.2d at 493 (quoting Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  However, where an agreement is ambiguous, the court should seek to determine the partiesâ€™ intent.Â  Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 295, 543 S.E.2d 271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001); Prestwick Golf Club, Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 331 S.C. 385, 390, 503 S.E.2d 184, 187 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œA contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning or when its meaning is unclear.â€Â  Ellie at 94, 594 S.E.2d at 493; accord Bruce at 160, 127 S.E.2d at 441; Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 493 S.E.2d 875 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œ[A]n ambiguous contract is one capable of being understood in more senses than one, an agreement obscure in meaning, through indefiniteness of expression, or having a double meaning.â€Â  Carolina Ceramics, Inc. v. Carolina Pipeline Co., 251 S.C. 151, 155-56, 161 S.E.2d 179, 181 (1968) (citation omitted)\r\nâ€œAmbiguous language in a contract should be construed liberally and most strongly in favor of the party who did not write or prepare the contract and is not responsible for the ambiguity; and any ambiguity in a contract, doubt, or uncertainty as to its meaning should be resolved against the party who prepared the contract or is responsible for the verbiage.â€Â  Myrtle Beach Lumber Co., Inc. v. Willoughby, 276 S.C. 3, 8, 274 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1981) (quoting 17A C.J.S.

Security Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993). \r\n \r\nWhether a contractâ€™s language is ambiguous is a question of law.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources v.

App. 2002), affâ€™d as modified, 356 S.C. 444, 590 S.E.2d 27 (2003).Â  Once the court decides the language is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the parties.Â  Id.; see also Charles v. B &amp; B Theatres, Inc., 234 S.C. 15, 18, 106 S.E.2d 455, 456 (1959) (â€œ[W]hen the written contract is ambiguous in its terms, ... parol and other extrinsic evidence will be admitted to determine the intent of the parties.â€) (citation omitted).Â  The determination of the partiesâ€™ intent is then a question of fact for the jury to determine.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources, 345 S.C. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 303.\r\nB. The Case Sub Judice\r\nIn granting Outparcelâ€™s motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n\tIâ€™m going to grant the motion for a directed verdict based on this mutual settlement and release that I marked as a Courtâ€™s Exhibit.Â  And just reading that there is no question that this lease and any causes of action that arise out of it, have been transferred to Mr. Ashy and his company, JDL Holdings.Â  That while I donâ€™t condone the actions of Mr. Gleatonâ€™s client, they are in privity, in privity with Mr. Ashy and his company with respect to this agreement.Â  And that all causes of action then existing or now existing at the time of the release arising hereafter, related to the events set forth in the lawsuit which could have been asserted in the lawsuit or related to the business relationship among the parties were fully settled.Â  So Iâ€™m granting the directed verdict.\r\n\r\nAlthough the judge was somewhat enigmatical, it appears he based the directed verdict award on Outparcelâ€™s contention that the Settlement Agreement between EPM to JDL had the effect of releasing Outparcel from EPMâ€™s claim for breach of their contractual right of first refusal.Â  This argument centered upon the following provision in the Settlement Agreement:\r\n\r\n\t3. Release by Danny Yopp d/b/a Ecclesiastes Ministries.Â  Danny Yopp d/b/a Ecclesiastes Ministries and its members, officers, directors, employees, heirs, successors and assigns, hereby release and forever discharge JDL Holdings, LLC, and any shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, servants, successors, and assigns, and any parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, and any other persons, firms, or corporations who are or may be liable, now or in the future, from any and all claims, demands, actions, or causes in action, whether in law or in equity, whether\r\n\tex contractu or ex delicto, for damages of any kind, including compensation, loss of profits or income, expenses, consequential damages, punitive damages, costs, attorneyâ€™s fees, expert witness fees, or any other damages, whether known or unknown, presently existing or which may arise in the future, arising out of, in connection with, or in any way related to the events set forth in the Lawsuit, or any other event, failures or breaches which are asserted or which could have been asserted in the Lawsuit.\r\n\r\nFollowing South Carolinaâ€™s rules of contract construction, the quoted language of the Settlement Agreement cannot possibly bear the meaning placed upon it by Outparcel and the circuit court.Â  Executed only days before the trial between EPM and JDL was scheduled to begin, the first sentence of the Settlement/Release states: Â â€œThis Mutual Release is . . . by and between JDL Holdings, LLC, Plaintiff and Danny Yopp d/b/a Ecclesiastes Productions Ministries.â€Â  Palpably, the Settlement Agreement was exclusively between EPM and JDL.Â  Outparcel is not, and was not invited to be, a party to the Settlement Agreement. Â Despite Outparcelâ€™s urging to the contrary, the release of â€œany other persons, firms, or corporations who are or may be liable, now or in the future, from any and all claims, demands, actions, or causes in actionâ€ can only reasonably be interpreted to include those persons and entities involved in the claims directly between EPM and JDL.\r\nEPM and JDL mutually settled and released the other from what the Settlement Agreement captioned as, â€œthe Lawsuit.â€Â  While the meaning of the term â€œthe Lawsuitâ€ may refer to the entirety of the litigation, pellucidly EPM and JDL did not intend to include any claims against Outparcel in what was being settled, as the agreement discusses the continued pursuit of claims against Outparcel by both EPM and JDL.Â  Unlike the general release in Bowers, the Settlement Agreement here clearly evinces an intent to limit its scope to the claims asserted by EPM and JDL against one another.\r\n\r\n\tThe Settlement Agreement is predicated upon the continuation of EPMâ€™s claims against Outparcel for fraud and contractual breach of the right of first refusal.Â  The fifth paragraph of the Settlement Agreement reads:\r\n\t5.Â  Payment by Danny Yopp d/b/a Ecclesiastes Ministries: In consideration of the aforementioned covenants and promises Danny Yopp d/b/a\r\n\tEcclesiastes Ministries, agrees to pay JDL Holdings, LLC the following:\r\n\tA.Â  One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars as settlement of JDLâ€™s claims for past due rents, attorneyâ€™s fees, etc.\r\n\ti.Â  Payment of the aforementioned $100,000.00 shall be due and payable if, and only if, Danny Yopp and/or Ecclesiastes Ministries are successful in obtaining a judgment against Outparcel Associates, LLC on the Cross Claims filed in said Lawsuit for an amount in excess of $200,000.00 and is successful in collecting on the judgment as provided herein. Â Danny Yopp agrees to vigorously pursue recovery of all of its damages as demanded in its complaint against Outparcel. Â In the event Danny Yopp and/or Ecclesiastes Ministries are successful in obtaining a judgment against Outparcel Associates, LLC on the Cross Claims filed in said Lawsuit for an amount less than $200,000.00, no amount will be due JDL Holdings, LLC or Peter Ashy. If Danny Yopp is awarded a judgment in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), the first one hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars received toward satisfaction of the judgment Danny Yopp may obtain against Outparcel will be free and clear of any claim by JDL Holdings, LLC or Peter Ashy. Any amounts received to satisfy the judgment in excess of $100,000 dollars will be divided 20% in favor of JDL Holdings and 80% in favor of Danny Yopp up to a maximum of $100,000 dollars (less attorney fees as provided herein) being paid to JDL Holdings to satisfy the terms of this settlement agreement. The actual amounts due and payable will be directly contingent upon the judgment obtained by Danny Yopp, if any, and those monies received to satisfy said judgment, if any. The parties further agree their respective attorneys will execute an additional addendum to this agreement following the outcome of the February 9th trial, in which the attorneyâ€™s [sic] will set forth in detail the actual judgment amounts and the ratioâ€™s [sic] and/or percentage each parties [sic] will be entitled to any collected monies. In the event Danny Yopp engages the services of an attorney to pursue collection of any judgment amount awarded, any reasonable contingency fees and costs charged by the attorney will be applied to any amounts received before applying the distribution percentages shown above. Payment will be due within fifteen (15) days of Danny Yopp and/or Ecclesiastes Production Ministries receiving cash or other funds as satisfaction of the judgment it anticipates obtaining on claims filed in this Lawsuit.\r\n\t\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tiv. The parties also recognize that JDL Holdings, LLC is in the process of filing a claim against Outparcel Associates, LLC and Solomon Bekele for breach of contract, conversion and other related claims. The parties agree that any judgment obtained by JDL Holdings, LLC against Outparcel in the subsequent suit will be subordinate to the first one hundred thousand dollars of the escrowed funds generated by the sale of the disputed property and being held by North Georgia Title, Inc., the Qualified Intermediary, or any real estate purchased with those funds, which may be available to satisfy both judgments. Â This provision in no manner limits, restricts or otherwise subordinates JDL Holdings, LLC ability to collect any judgment it may obtain against Solomon Bekele individually.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â   \r\nJDLâ€™s recovery from EPM is entirely dependent on EPM successfully recovering in its suit with Outparcel.Â  Key provisions of the agreement contemplate successful litigation against Outparcel, not its release.Â  EPMâ€™s settlement payment to JDL is conditioned upon EPMâ€™s continued pursuit of its claims against Outparcel: â€œPayment . . . shall be due and payable if, and only if Danny Yopp and/or [EPM] are successful in obtaining a judgment against Outparcel . . . .â€Â  EPM agrees to â€œvigorously pursue recovery of all of its damages as demanded in its complaint against Outparcel.â€Â  Furthermore, the agreement discusses a lawsuit JDL has filed against Outparcel.Â  In order for this section to be efficaciousness and have any purpose whatsoever, indubitably the Settlement Agreement must be interpreted as effecting solely the suit between EPM and JDL. Â An interpretation otherwise would render this section absurd and nugatory.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4255","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Furman Thompson appeals his convictions for first degree burglary and attempted armed robbery, claiming the judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the morning of February 16, 2004, Thompson met with Wanda Harris and discussed whether she knew of a â€œlick.â€ Â Harris testified a â€œlickâ€ is a target for a robbery. Â Later that day, Harris called Thompson and told him about a potential lick and asked him to meet her.Â  Thompson showed up approximately one hour later with Darrel Sturkey, the codefendant in the underlying case. Â Sturkey and Harris planned the details of the burglary while Thompson spoke with Tyrone Scott, who accompanied Harris to the scene.\r\n \r\nAccording to the plan, Harris walked alone to the apartment to investigate the potential lick under the guise of purchasing crack cocaine.Â  Harris testified that as she approached the apartment, Scott lagged behind her. Â Just before Harris entered the apartment, she turned around and did not see Thompson or Sturkey.\r\n \r\nHarris then entered the apartment and began a conversation with Torrey Hudson, who lived there, while Hudsonâ€™s friend, Andre Chiles, sat on the couch watching television. Â Chiles had a gun on the couch next to him. Â While Harris attempted to buy some crack cocaine, Scott knocked on the door and was let into the apartment. Â Harris and Scott are frequently together so this did not alarm Hudson or Chiles. Â Scott informed Hudson he knew of other potential customers in case Hudson wanted to sell more crack cocaine, but Hudson informed Scott he did not have any more crack. Â Shortly thereafter, Harris and Scott attempted to leave the apartment. \r\n \r\nAs Harris walked out of the door, she saw Sturkey standing against the outer wall of the apartment pulling a ski mask over his head. Â Sturkey pushed Harris out of the way, stepped into the apartment and fired a gun into the apartment. Â Chiles immediately grabbed his gun and returned fire towards the intruder. Â After several shots were exchanged between Sturkey and Chiles, Chilesâ€™ gun jammed and he retreated into the bathroom to clear the gun. Â When Chiles came out of the bathroom, the apartment was empty.\r\n \r\nAs a result of the altercation, Chiles sustained two gunshots to the abdomen.Â  Sturkey sustained one gunshot to his right leg.Â  Nothing was stolen from the apartment or from either of the occupants.Â  Thompson and Sturkey were charged with first degree burglary and attempted armed robbery, and Sturkey was also charged with assault and battery with attempt to kill.Â  Thompson and Sturkey were tried together, and the jury convicted each on their respective charges.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThompson argues the trial judge erred by not directing a verdict of not guilty because the state failed to present any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence to show that Thompson was guilty of first degree burglary or attempted armed robbery, either as a principal or as an accomplice.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen analyzing the denial of a directed verdict motion, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  â€œThe trial court, in a directed verdict motion, is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its weight.â€Â  State v. Elmore, 368 S.C. 230, 234, 628 S.E.2d 271, 273 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The trial court must be affirmed if the record contains any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 294, 509 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1998); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 274, 276, 400 S.E.2d 131, 132 (1991).\r\nâ€œUnder the â€˜hand of one is the hand of allâ€™ theory [of accomplice liability], one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.â€Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œA defendant may be convicted on a theory of accomplice liability pursuant to an indictment charging him only with the principal offense.â€Â  Id. at 194, 562 S.E.2d at 325. \r\n \r\nMere presence and prior knowledge that a crime was going to be committed, without more, is insufficient to constitute guilt.Â  Id. at 195, 562 S.E.2d at 325.Â  However, â€œpresence at the scene of a crime by pre-arrangement to aid, encourage, or abet in the perpetration of the crime constitutes guilt as a [principal].â€Â  State v. Hill, 268 S.C. 390, 395-96, 234 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1977).Â  \r\n \r\nA person is guilty of first degree burglary when he enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling and either:\r\n\r\n\t(1) when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime: (a) is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; or (b) causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime; or (c) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or (d) displays what is or appears to be a knife, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm; or . . . (3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. 2006).Â  A person is guilty of attempted armed robbery if the person has a specific intent to commit armed robbery.Â  State v. Nesbit, 346 S.C. 226, 231, 550 S.E.2d 864, 866-67 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â  â€œRobbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€Â  State v. Bland, 315 S.C. 315, 317, 457 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1995).Â Â Â  The crime is â€œarmed robberyâ€ when a person commits a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.Â  State v. Tasco, 292 S.C. 270, 272, 356 S.E.2d 117, 118 (1987).Â  \r\n \r\nTestimony in this case establishes that the codefendant, Sturkey, entered the apartment without permission, during the nighttime, with a gun, and intended to commit the crime of armed robbery.Â  Therefore, the crime of burglary in the first degree with respect to Sturkey was established sufficiently to withstand a directed verdict motion.Â  Testimony also showed that it was the intent of Sturkey, at the very least, to use a deadly weapon to rob Hudson of money, goods, or personal property.Â  Therefore, the crime of attempted armed robbery with respect to Sturkey was sufficiently established to withstand a directed verdict motion.Â  The question that remains before us is whether Sturkeyâ€™s crimes can be imputed to Thompson either as a principal or under a theory of accomplice liability.\r\nSturkeyâ€™s statement, which was read into evidence during Officer Bobby Cariasâ€™ testimony, establishes that Sturkey and three others were together when they came up with the plan to rob Hudson. Â Later when everyone ran from the scene, â€œthe guy asked if [Sturkey] was okay.Â  [Sturkey] told him [he] was okay. . . .Â  We got in the car and went home.â€ Â Sturkeyâ€™s statement constitutes direct evidence that Sturkey arrived at the scene and left the scene with one of the three other participants.Â \r\n \r\nHarrisâ€™ testimony constitutes direct evidence that Thompson asked her if she knew of a lick, then later spoke to her on the phone about a possible lick.Â  Further, it establishes Thompson then showed up with Sturkey at the apartment complex where Harris informed him there was a possible lick, and Thompson was present in the vicinity while Harris and Sturkey planned the robbery. Â \r\nIn Hill, the appellant previously discussed the robbery with the perpetrators, appeared at the crime scene, and may have viewed the commission of the robbery, but he was possibly unaware of the final planning and did not accompany the perpetrators as they committed the robbery.Â  Hill at 396, 234 S.E.2d at 221.Â  The Court in Hill found the evidence justified submission of the case to the jury.Â  Id.Â  Likewise, here Thompson discussed the robbery, appeared at the crime scene with Sturkey, and may have viewed the attempted robbery.Â  At the very least, Thompson aided the commission of the crime by driving Sturkey to the scene and encouraged the crime by setting the events in motion earlier that day.\r\nThus, under the hand of one is the hand of all theory of accomplice liability, acts committed by Sturkey are imputed to Thompson making him guilty of any acts done incidental to the execution of the common design or scheme of the crime.Â  State v. Curry, 370 S.C. 674, 684, 636 S.E.2d 649, 654 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the trial judge properly denied Thompsonâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on each charge and submitted the case to the jury. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â  \r\nSTILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4256","title":"Shuler v.

Painter, of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Frederick D. Shuler filed this action alleging entitlement to workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Shuler appeals the circuit courtâ€™s ruling he was not an employee of Tri-County Electric Co-op, Inc. (the Co-op) and therefore not entitled to coverage.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Co-op is a rural electric cooperative.[1]Â  Shuler served on the Co-opâ€™s Board of Trustees.Â  Shuler requested authorization from the Co-op to attend the annual convention of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association in Dallas.Â  Although Shulerâ€™s attendance was not mandatory, and he was not a voting delegate at the meeting, the Co-op approved his request.Â  Shuler was injured in an automobile accident while driving to Dallas and filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  The Co-op denied the claim, contending Shuler was not an employee.Â  \r\n \r\nAs a board member, Shuler received compensation from the Co-op, including reimbursed expenses and a per diem allowance for attendance at meetings.Â  This compensation was designated on Shulerâ€™s IRS 1099 form issued by the Co-op as â€œNonemployee compensation.â€Â  Shuler also received benefits from enrollment in the Co-opâ€™s retirement and health insurance plans. Â \r\nThe single commissioner found Shuler was not the Co-opâ€™s employee and was therefore ineligible for workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  The full commission reversed the commissioner.Â  The circuit court reversed the full commission, reinstating the single commissionerâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe existence of an employer-employee relationship is a factual question that determines the jurisdiction of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110, 112&nbsp;(2002).Â  When an issue involves jurisdiction, the appellate court can take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â Â  Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703&nbsp;(2000).Â  â€œIn determining jurisdictional questions, doubts of jurisdiction will be resolved in favor of inclusion of employees within workersâ€™ compensation coverage rather than exclusion.â€Â  Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, 94, 447 S.E.2d 841, 842&nbsp;(1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nShuler argues he is an employee of the Co-op and therefore entitled to workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nTo decide the issue of employment in this case, we are required to review:Â  1) the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, 2) the Electric Cooperative Act, and 3) the Co-opâ€™s by-laws. Â We shall do so seriatim.\r\nIn interpreting the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, we are required to construe the statutes liberally in favor of coverage.Â  Peay v. U.S. Silica Co., 313 S.C. 91, 94, 437 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1993).Â  The primary section of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act involved in this case is section 42-1-130.Â  Section 42-1-130 defines an employee as a â€œperson engaged in an employment under any appointment [or] contract of hire, . . . expressed or implied, oral or written . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2006). \r\n \r\nIn construing the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act to define an employee, our court has held that coverage depends on the existence of an employment relationship.Â  Edens v. Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 439, 597 S.E.2d 863, 866&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  The â€˜contract of employmentâ€™ is the jurisdictional factor used to determine if an employment relationship exists.Â  Alewine v. Tobin Quarries, Inc., 206 S.C. 103, 109, 33 S.E.2d 81, 83 (1945).Â  Although no formality is required, the contract is established if the parties recognize each other as employer and employee.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, an employeeâ€™s right to demand payment for his services from the employer is essential to the establishment of an employment relationship.Â  Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 311 S.C. 255, 257, 428 S.E.2d 721, 723&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993), affâ€™d, 314 S.C. 43, 443 S.E.2d 803 (1994).Â  For example, in Doe v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 323 S.C. 33, 39-40, 448 S.E.2d 564, 567-68 (Ct. App. 1994), this court held an unpaid volunteer candy striper was not the employee of a hospital.Â  Likewise, in McCreery v. Covenant Presbyterian, this court found an unpaid church volunteer not an employee of the church for workersâ€™ compensation purposes.Â  299 S.C. 218, 383 S.E.2d 264 (1989), revâ€™d on other grounds, 303 S.C. 271, 400 S.E.2d 130 (1990).Â  See also Kirksey, 311 S.C. at 257, 428 S.E.2d at 723 (finding unpaid daughter of store owner not an employee).Â  See generally 3 Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 65.01 (2006). \r\n \r\nTo correctly determine the relationship of the parties in this case, we must next turn our attention to the language of the Electric Cooperative Act and the by-laws adopted by the individual co-op pursuant to the provisions of that act.Â  The Electric Cooperative Act governs rural electric cooperatives in South Carolina.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§33-49-10 to -1450 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2006).Â  Section 33-49-630 of the Electric Cooperative Act, entitled â€œCompensation or employment of trustee,â€ provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe bylaws may make provision for the compensation of trustees; \r\n\tprovided, however, that compensation shall not be paid except for actual attendance upon activities authorized by the board. Â The bylaws may also provide for the travel, expenses and other benefits of trustees, as set by the board. Â A trustee, except in emergencies, shall not be employed by the cooperative in any other capacity involving compensation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-630 (2006) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n \r\nWhile we are required to construe the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act liberally in favor of coverage, the same is not true in the interpretation and construction of either the Electric Cooperative Act or the by-laws adopted pursuant thereto.Â  With regard to these enactments, we apply more general rules of construction. Â The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp., 369 S.C. 150, 153-54, 631 S.E.2d 533, 535&nbsp;(2006).Â  The court should give words their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Sloan&nbsp;v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598, 607&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\n \r\nThe plain language of section 33-49-630 allows a rural electric cooperative to provide for the compensation of trustees and limits this compensation â€œfor actual attendance upon activities authorized by the board.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-49-630 (2006).Â  However, this section does not mandate the compensation or employment of a trustee, nor does it create in the trustee a right to demand payment.Â  See, e.g., Nallan v. Motion Picture Studio Mechs. Union, 360 N.E.2d 353, 353&nbsp;(N.Y. 1976) (emphasizing, in the context of whether a board member of a labor union was an employee of the union, that the board memberâ€™s stipend did not constitute a salary or compensation under workersâ€™ compensation laws).Â  We also find instructive the language of the Electric Cooperative Act itself, which prohibits a trustee from being employed by the cooperative in any other capacity involving compensation except in emergency situations.Â  We are able to discern no right to demand a wage arising pursuant to section 33-49-630 sufficient to satisfy the test for the creation of an employment relationship as required in court decisions.Â  Nor do we discern from the Electric Cooperative Act any intent by the legislature to create an employment relationship for purposes of workersâ€™ compensation benefits. \r\n \r\nFinally, we look to the by-laws of the individual co-op to determine if they provide a basis for concluding that an employment relationship existed between the Co-op and Shuler.Â  The by-laws are an integral component establishing Shulerâ€™s relationship as a board member of Tri-County Electric Co-op.Â  The by-laws should be construed in the same manner a contract is construed because they form the basis for the relationship between the parties, as does a typical contract.Â  â€œThe primary purpose of all rules of contract construction is to determine the intent of the parties.â€Â  Goldston v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 358 S.C. 157, 170, 594 S.E.2d 511, 518&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  In determining the partiesâ€™ intentions, the court must read the contract as a whole.Â  S. Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 356 S.C. 444, 447, 590 S.E.2d 27, 29&nbsp;(2003).Â  When the language of a contract is clear, explicit, and unambiguous, the language of the contract alone determines the contractâ€™s force and effect, and the court must construe it according to its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  Moser v. Gosnell, 334 S.C. 425, 430, 513 S.E.2d 123, 125 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nArticle IV, Section 9 \r\n\tof the by-laws provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tBoard members shall not receive any salary for their services as such, except that the board may authorize a fixed sum for each day or portion thereof spent on Cooperative business . . . . Â If authorized by the board, board members may also be reimbursed for expenses actually and necessarily incurred in carrying out such cooperative business or granted a reasonable per diem allowance . . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nOther provisions of the by-laws provide that trustees are elected by the Co-op members and serve for a fixed term of three years.Â  The by-laws provide that trustees must be members, but employees do not have to be members.Â  They also prohibit any employee from being a trustee while being simultaneously employed by the Co-op or having been employed in the preceding five years.Â  â€œNo person shall be eligible to become or remain a board member . . . who . . . is employed by the Cooperative or was employed by the Cooperative at any time during the preceding five (5) years.â€Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough the by-laws permit compensation on a per diem basis, provide for trustees to be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred, and allow other benefits, when read as a whole the by-laws do not create an employment relationship.Â  Rather, these benefits and compensation constitute gratuitous payments, allowed in the boardâ€™s discretion, and are not compensation for services rendered.Â \r\n \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold Shuler is not the Co-opâ€™s employee, and he is not entitled to coverage under the workersâ€™ compensation act.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The parties stipulated many of the facts before the single commissioner. Â \r\n[2]&nbsp; Shuler contends the circuit court erred in several other aspects of its analysis.Â  However, based on our conclusion that Shuler is not the Co-opâ€™s employee, we need not address these issues.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4257","title":"State v.

Â Circuit Court Judge Jackson Gregory sentenced Spare to ten years imprisonment, which was suspended upon five years probation and the payment of restitution in an amount to be calculated at a later date.Â  After a restitution hearing was held on August 13, 2003, Judge Gregory ordered Spare to pay restitution in the amount of $34,475 to the victim, plus a mandatory 20 percent collection fee, resulting in a total restitution obligation of $41,370.Â  \r\n \r\nOn May 12, 2004, Spareâ€™s probation agent served Spare with a financial probation citation, alleging that Spare was in arrears for his restitution.Â  By order dated June 15, 2004, Judge Gregory continued Spare on probation but ordered him to enroll in the Restitution Center.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nOn September 12, 2005, Spare was again served with a financial probation citation for being $4,921 in arrears on restitution. Â On that date, the unpaid balance of the restitution was $40,362.75.\r\nCircuit Court Judge Howard King held a probation revocation hearing on September 15, 2005.Â  In addressing the court regarding the violation, Spareâ€™s probation agent stated that Spare had reported on time and had paid what he could toward the restitution.Â  He added that Spare has â€œsome financial situations that donâ€™t particularly allow him to pay the $753 a month that he has been ordered to.â€Â  In terms of Spareâ€™s employment, Spareâ€™s counsel explained that Spare was unable to work for the government, his previous employer, or use his masterâ€™s degree as a result of his criminal record, which included a drug conviction.Â  Spare was employed with Cracker Barrel for forty-four hours per week.Â  His check, however, had been garnished by the Internal Revenue Service for payment of back taxes and was also used to make payments to probation.Â  He further stated that Spare does not own any real property, but instead, resides at a Motel 6 and eats all of his meals at his place of employment.Â  Counsel emphasized that Spare had â€œnot missed a payment other than . . . not having the ability to make the required payment a month.â€Â  Counsel also pointed out that Spare paid less toward his financial obligation when he attended the Restitution Center for 181 days because he was making less money than he was currently earning at Cracker Barrel. \r\n \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Judge King found that \r\nSpare had willfully violated the terms of his probation.&nbsp; As a result, \r\nJudge King revoked one year of Spareâ€™s sentence and ordered Spare to remain on \r\nprobation and pay restitution when he was released from prison.&nbsp;  \r\nSpare appeals the revocation of his probation.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSpare argues the circuit court judge erred in revoking his probation when he was employed full time and paying restitution.Â  He contends his failure to pay was not willful given he was making a bona fide effort to pay his court-ordered obligation.Â  \r\n \r\nThe decision to revoke probation is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 94, 634 S.E.2d 653, 655 (2006); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-460 (2007).Â  â€œThis courtâ€™s authority to review such a decision is confined to correcting errors of law unless the lack of a legal or evidentiary basis indicates the circuit judgeâ€™s decision was arbitrary and capricious.â€Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 647, 511 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Â \r\nIn deciding whether to revoke probation, â€œ[t]he trial court must determine whether the State has presented sufficient evidence to establish that a probationer has violated the conditions of his probation.â€Â  Allen, 370 S.C. at 94, 634 S.E.2d at 655.Â  â€œProbation is a matter of grace; revocation is the means to enforce the conditions of probation.â€Â  Hamilton, 333 S.C. at 97, 511 S.E.2d at 648; see State v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 136, 61 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1950) (â€œWhile probation is a matter of grace, the probationer is entitled to fair treatment, and is not to be made the victim of whim or caprice.â€).Â  Â â€œHowever, the authority of the revoking court should always be predicated upon an evidentiary showing of fact tending to establish a violation of the conditions.â€Â  Hamilton, 333 S.C. at 97, 511 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nOur appellate courts have continued to maintain that â€œprobation may not be revoked solely for failure to make required payments of fines or restitution without the circuit judge first determining on the record that the probationer has failed to make a bona fide effort to pay.â€ Â Hamilton, 333 S.C. at 649, 511 S.E.2d at 97 (discussing Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983))[2]; Nichols v. State, 308 S.C. 334, 337, 417 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1992); Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481, 483, 343 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1986).Â  â€œTherefore, in those cases involving the failure to pay fines or restitution, the circuit judge must, in addition to finding sufficient factual evidence of the violation, make an additional finding of willfulness.â€Â  Hamilton, 333 S.C. at 649, 511 S.E.2d at 97.\r\nâ€œWillful failure to pay means a voluntary, conscious and intentional failure.â€Â  People v. Davis, 576 N.E.2d 510, 513 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991); see State v. Sowell, 370 S.C. 330, 336, 635 S.E.2d 81, 83 (2006) (â€œA willful act is defined as one â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€ (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988))). Â â€œThe trial court may infer that the failure to pay is intentional where a probationer has the ability to pay a fee, but does not do so.â€Â  Joseph v. State, 3 S.W.3d 627, 641 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)(citations omitted).Â \r\n \r\nâ€œA proper analysis should include an inquiry into the reasons surrounding the probationerâ€™s failure to pay, followed by a determination of whether the probationer made a willful choice not to pay.â€Â  Commonwealth v. Eggers, 742 A.2d 174, 176 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1999).Â  â€œAfter making those determinations, if the court finds the probationer â€˜could not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to do so,â€™ the court should then consider alternatives to incarceration in accordance with Bearden.â€ Id. at 176 (quoting Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 672 (1983)).\r\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, we find the circuit court judge abused his discretion in concluding that Spareâ€™s failure to pay restitution was willful.Â  Based on our review of the record, we believe the judge failed to make the requisite inquiry into Spareâ€™s ability to pay, his reasons for failing to pay, and whether his failure to pay was willful.Â  From all indications, Spare was making progress, albeit slow, toward paying his restitution obligation.Â  After being released from the Restitution Center, he obtained a full-time job in which he worked forty-four hours per week.Â  As represented by counsel, Spare was using his income from this job to pay for housing at a local motel, pay the IRS for back taxes, and make payments toward his court-ordered financial obligation.Â  Significantly, Spareâ€™s probation agent stated at the hearing that Spare has â€œsome financial situations that donâ€™t particularly allow him to pay the $753 a month that he has been ordered to.â€\r\n \r\nTherefore, without a specific accounting of Spareâ€™s total earnings, living expenses, other sources of income, and potential earning capacity, it is difficult to conclude that he had the ability to pay more toward his restitution but made a voluntary, conscious, and intentional decision not to pay.Â  Although we understand the courtâ€™s frustration with Spareâ€™s limited progress in making payments, we find the evidence does not support the courtâ€™s finding of willfulness.Â  \r\n \r\nBased on the foregoing discussion, we vacate the revocation of Spareâ€™s probation and remand this case for a new probation revocation hearing.Â  See Eggers, 742 A.2d at 176 (vacating revocation of probation based on probationerâ€™s failure to pay and remanding for a new hearing where trial court â€œmade no judicial inquiry into the [probationerâ€™s] ability to pay and reasons for [probationerâ€™s] failure to make paymentâ€ and disregarded â€œan inquiry into whether the failure to pay was willful, and if willful, whether alternatives to incarceration were properâ€); Davis, 576 N.E.2d at 513-14 (reversing revocation of probation for probationerâ€™s failure to pay and remanding for trial court to determine whether an additional period of probation should be granted within which restitution may be paid where there was evidence that probationer made restitution payments before becoming unemployed and the record did not show that defendant refused to work merely to avoid restitution); see also Jordan v. State, 939 S.W.2d 255, 257-58 (Ark. 1997)(reversing and remanding revocation of probation for failure to pay, based on state statutory guidelines, and holding that probationerâ€™s lack of financial assistance from family and friends did not demonstrate that probationer willfully refused to pay restitution and could not be the basis for revoking probation).\r\nVACATED AND REMANDED.[3]\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In Bearden v. Georgia, the United States Supreme Court established the analytical procedure required for the revocation of probation based solely on a probationerâ€™s failure to pay a fine and make restitution.Â  Specifically, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\tWe hold, therefore, that in revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay.Â  If the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to pay, the court may revoke probation and sentence the defendant to imprisonment within the authorized range of its sentencing authority.Â  If the probationer could not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to do so, the court must consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment.Â  Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the Stateâ€™s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay.Â  To do otherwise would deprive the probationer of his conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay the fine.Â  Such a deprivation would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nBearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 673 (1983).\r\n[3]Â Â  Although the State indicates in its brief that Spare was released from prison during the pendency of this appeal, we do not believe the issue presented is moot given the restitution is still outstanding and Spare will undoubtedly be issued another financial probation citation for being in arrears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4258","title":"Plott v.

Plott and Demitria C. Votta (collectively Respondents) to use an easement and directing them to cease these actions.Â  In addition, Appellants contend the trial judge erred in refusing to apply res judicata or collateral estoppel to bar Respondentsâ€™ suit.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nEncampment Plantation is an 852-acre tract of land in Charleston County.Â  Robert Lawson Horner and Lisa J. Horner owned 64.57 acres of real property known as â€œTract 1â€ in Encampment Plantation.Â  In April 1994, the Horners obtained the approval of the Charleston County Planning Board to subdivide Tract 1.Â  As part of the process, they agreed to dedicate a fifty-foot wide right-of-way easement known as â€œEncampment Plantation Driveâ€ in between the two new tracts, known as â€œTract 1Aâ€ and â€œTract 1B,â€ respectively.[1]Â  On April 20, 1994, they recorded a plat showing Tracts 1A and 1B, as well as Encampment Plantation Drive.\r\nOn May 12, 1994, the Horners conveyed Tract 1B to Myrtis M. Jenkins, Lisa Hornerâ€™s mother.Â  Jenkins immediately sold the tract to Susan Dillard, who eventually deeded it to Respondents.Â  Each deed contains the following pertinent language creating an easement for the benefit of Tract 1B:\r\n\r\n\tTOGETHER with a perpetual, non-exclusive, appendant and appurtenant easement for ingress and egress upon, over and across that certain 2.22 acre 50' right-of-way known as â€œENCAMPMENT PLANTATION DRIVEâ€ . . . . This easement is for the commercial and economic benefit of [Tract 1B] and is appurtenant to and transferable with the title to said [Tract 1B].\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 1994, the Horners conveyed both Tract 1A and Encampment Plantation Drive to Appellants, with the following language in the property description:\r\n\r\n\tSAID PROPERTY IS CONVEYED SUBJECT to the ingress and egress easement over and across that certain 2.22 acre 50' right-of-way known as \r\n\t\r\n\tEncampment Plantation Drive granted to Susan P. Dillard by deed of Myrtis M. Jenkins . . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nEncampment Plantation Drive provides access to Highway 17 from various properties within Encampment Plantation.Â  From Highway 17, a traveler would turn onto Encampment Plantation Drive and proceed north.Â  Several hundred feet from Highway 17, Tract 1A would lie to the west and Tract 1B to the east of Encampment Plantation Drive. Encampment Plantation Drive ends at a cul-de-sac.Â  Tract 1B fronts the eastern side of Encampment Plantation Drive for approximately 451 feet. \r\n \r\nIn 1997, Appellant Justin Enterprises instituted an action against Respondents, alleging Respondents trespassed on Tract 1A and removed timber.Â  Respondents answered and asserted several counterclaims for trespass and interference with their use of Tract 1B.[2]Â  On March 14, 2000, Respondents moved to amend their answer and assert additional counterclaims.Â  Of relevance to this appeal is Respondentsâ€™ attempt to claim Justin Enterprises placed stakes along the eastern boundary of Encampment Plantation Drive and set a log within the cul-de-sac.Â  Respondents further argued these actions interfered with their use of the easement.\r\nThe trial court denied Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend, emphasizing the motion was made approximately one month before the trial scheduled for April 17, 2000.Â  At trial, Respondents referenced the actions leading to the proposed amendment and referenced the prohibited counterclaim in closing argument.Â  The jury awarded Justin Enterprises $1,300 on the causes of action it raised in its complaint and denied Respondents relief on their counterclaims.[3] \r\n \r\nIn September 2002, Appellants began planting large shrubs on the eastern boundary of Encampment Plantation Drive.Â  Eventually, Appellants built a wire fence on the same boundary.Â  These actions prevented Respondents from accessing Tract 1B at any point prior to the cul-de-sac.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nRespondents then filed this action for declaratory judgment defining the rights of the parties in and to the easement, as well as an injunction ordering Appellants to tear down the fence and remove the newly-planted shrubs.Â  Appellants answered, asserting the prior action between the parties barred Respondentsâ€™ suit under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.Â  Appellants also denied their actions interfered with Respondentsâ€™ rights.\r\nAfter a bench trial, the trial judge granted injunctive relief to Respondents.Â  The trial judge also found â€œthe grant and scope of the easement . . . was not at issue in the previous litigation and . . . neither the doctrine of res judicata nor collateral estoppel bar suit in the present action.â€Â  Appellants moved for reconsideration or a new trial, both of which the trial judge denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law action,[4] the determination of the extent of an easement is an equitable matter.[5]Â  Accordingly, an appellate court may review the trial judgeâ€™s findings de novo.[6]Â  â€œOur broad scope of review, however, does not require this Court to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility.â€[7]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Appellants contend the trial judge erred in refusing to apply the doctrine of res judicata.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œRes judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between those parties.â€[8]Â  Under res judicata, â€œ[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€[9]\r\nâ€œRes judicata requires three elements be met: Â 1) a final, valid judgment on the merits; 2) identity of parties; and 3) the second action must involve matters properly included in the first suit.â€[10]Â  â€œThe rule as to the conclusiveness of the prior adjudication has a different application where the prior and subsequent causes of action are identical and where the subsequent action is on a different cause of action.â€[11] Â Although res judicata may apply even though the plaintiff in the first suit proceeded under a different legal theory,[12] â€œwhere the second suit is upon a different claim, the former judgment is conclusive only as to those issues actually determined.â€[13] \r\n \r\nAccording to the amended complaint from the 1997 action, Justin Enterprises alleged Respondents were â€œcontinuously trespassing on [its] property, removing marketable timber, destroying landscape and burning evidence of such conduct . . . .â€Â  In their answer and counterclaim, Respondents alleged Justin Enterprises â€œdeliberately interfered with the free use and enjoyment . . . of their property by preventing [them] and those hired by them from performing work on [their] property . . . .â€Â  They also alleged Justin Enterprises trespassed on their property â€œby constructing and maintaining an underground power line without permissionâ€ and maintaining a pond and ditch system that caused flooding on their property. Â We have found nothing in the arguments Appellants presented either in their briefs or during oral argument that would explain how resolution of any of the claims or counterclaims would necessarily involve a determination of where Respondents could access their property from the right-of-way.[14]Â  Moreover, the trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow Respondents to proceed on their claim for interference with their use of the right-of-way was not a ruling on the merits of that cause of action.[15]Â  We therefore hold there were no circumstances that would support a determination that res judicata barred Respondentsâ€™ cause of action for interference with their easement.\r\nÂ 2.Â  Appellants also contend Respondents were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the scope of the easement. We disagree.\r\n \r\nâ€œCollateral estoppel prevents a party from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.â€[16]Â  â€œIn order to successfully assert collateral estoppel, the party seeking issue preclusion must show that the issue was actually litigated and directly determined in the prior action, and that the matter or fact directly in issue was necessary to support the first judgment.â€[17]Â  \r\n \r\nIn support of their argument that Respondents were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the scope of the easement, Appellants have quoted extensively from the trial transcript of the 1997 lawsuit.Â  In the previous action, however, Justin Enterprises also advanced the position that Respondents could have removed the stakes placed along the eastern boundary of Encampment Plantation Drive.Â  The verdict for Justin Enterprises in that action, then, could have been based on the juryâ€™s determination that the obstructions were not unreasonable rather than on any finding concerning Respondentsâ€™ right to access their property at any point other than the cul-de-sac.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold Appellants have not shown that resolution of the issue in controversy in the present appeal, namely where Respondents could access Encampment Plantation Drive from Tract 1B, was necessary to support the prior judgment.\r\n3.Â  Appellants argue the trial judge erred in finding their placement of the fence and shrubbery along the eastern boundary of Encampment Plantation Drive improperly interfered with Respondentsâ€™ use of the easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe language of an easement determines its extent.â€[18]Â  Thus, this court must construe unambiguous language in the grant of an easement according to the terms the parties have used.[19]Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œThe general rule is that the character of an express easement is determined by the nature of the right and the intention of the parties creating it.â€[20]Â  The easement in this case was expressly â€œfor the commercial and economic benefit ofâ€ Tract 1B.Â  It grants Respondents a right of ingress and egress â€œupon, over and acrossâ€ Encampment Plantation Drive and provides no express limits on the right of Respondents to traverse Encampment Plantation Drive as it existed at the time the easement was created.[21]Â  The word â€œacrossâ€ means â€œso as to intersect or pass at an angle (as a right angle) to . . . .â€[22]Â  Respondents presented ample testimony supporting their contention that the fence and shrubbery prevented them from proceeding across Encampment Plantation Drive at several points along its eastern boundary.[23]Â  Accordingly, we hold a preponderance of the evidence supports the trial judgeâ€™s determination that the shrubbery and fence interfered with Respondentsâ€™ use and enjoyment of the easement.[24]Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n4.Â  Finally, we reject Appellantsâ€™ contention that â€œthe disputed easement was created through a process tainted by misrepresentation in violation of the Charleston County Subdivision Regulations and was thus void ab initio.â€\r\nAppellants argue that, because Robert Horner used his mother-in-law, Myrtis Jenkins, as a â€œstraw purchaserâ€ to circumvent applicable county regulations when he subdivided Tract 1, the subdivision failed to meet the requirements of the applicable regulations and was by definition invalid.Â  We disagree.Â  Notwithstanding the allegedly suspect nature of both the conveyance to Jenkins and her sale of Tract 1B to Respondentsâ€™ predecessor-in-interest the same day she received title from the Horners, the initial transfer conformed to the regulations relevant to intra-family conveyances, and we are unaware of any restrictions on subsequent conveyances to other persons.[25]Â  Moreover, there appears to be no dispute that both the subdivision and the easement were properly platted and recorded.Â  To invalidate the easement to which Appellantsâ€™ property is subject because of some impropriety allegedly tainting a prior transfer within their chain of title would be inherently unfair to subsequent purchasers, who rely on public documents to determine their rights under recorded plats and deeds.Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Within Encampment Plantation Drive lies an existing avenue that serves other properties in the area.Â  \r\n \r\n[2]Â  The counterclaims included allegations that (1) Justin Enterprises prevented Respondents and those hired by them from performing work on Respondentsâ€™ property; (2) Justin Enterprises trespassed on and damaged Respondentsâ€™ property by constructing and maintaining an underground power line without permission; and (3) the maintenance of a pond and ditch system by Justin Enterprises on its property caused flooding problems on Respondentsâ€™ land.\r\n[3] Â The verdict form failed to delineate the individual counterclaims, leaving this court to speculate which issues the jury decided.\r\n[4]Â  Jowers v.

Salter, III, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Jeremy Avery appeals his convictions and sentences for murder, armed robbery, and car jacking.Â  Avery argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his motions for change of venue and severance.Â  He also argues the trial court erred in ruling his statements to law enforcement were admissible because they were given voluntarily.Â  Finally, Avery asserts the family court erred in failing to consider the appropriate factors before transferring jurisdiction to the circuit court, and that the transfer was unconstitutional.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nI.\r\nOn September 27, 2002, Avery and another man car-jacked, robbed, and murdered a man in Sumter County.Â  Shortly thereafter, law enforcement took Avery to the Sumter County Law Enforcement Center, where they handcuffed him to a chair, and read him his Miranda rights.[2]Â  Avery signed a waiver of his Miranda rights and verbally confessed to the car jacking, robbery, and murder.Â  Law enforcement allowed Avery to talk to his mother, after which Avery signed a written statement memorializing his earlier verbal confession.Â  The Department of Juvenile Justice assumed custody of Avery, and the case went before the family court. \r\n \r\nThe family court transferred jurisdiction of the case to the circuit court.Â  Avery moved the trial court for (1) change of venue, (2) severance, (3) suppression of written statements Avery made to Sumter County law enforcement, and (4) remand back to the family court because the transfer violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  The trial court denied all motions.Â  The jury convicted Avery of all charges and the trial judge sentenced him to thirty-five years imprisonment.Â  Avery appeals. \r\n \r\nII.\r\nA.&nbsp; Change of Venue \r\nAvery argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for change of venue because the members of the jury were exposed to extensive pretrial publicity.Â  The trial court did not err.\r\n \r\nâ€œA motion to change venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 7, 495 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1997).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling has no evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tWhen a trial judge bases the denial of a motion for a change of venue because of pretrial publicity upon an adequate voir dire examination of the jurors, his decision will not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances.Â  When jurors have been exposed to pretrial publicity, a denial of a change of venue is not error when the jurors are found to have the ability to set aside any impressions or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial.Â  Therefore, mere exposure to pretrial publicity does not automatically disqualify a prospective juror.Â  Instead, the relevant question is not whether the community remembered the case, but whether the jurors had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.Â  It is the defendantâ€™s burden to demonstrate actual juror prejudice as a result of such publicity.\r\n\r\nSheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 655, 594 S.E.2d 462, 467 (2004) (citations omitted); see also State v. Evins, Op. No. 26329 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 14, 2007) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 20 at 21).Â  â€œAbsent extraordinary circumstances, the ruling of the trial judge, developed through adequate voir dire examination of the jurors, that the objectivity of the jury panel has not been polluted with outside influence, will not be disturbed.â€Â  State v. Fowler, 266 S.C. 203, 208, 222 S.E.2d 497, 499 (1976).Â  \r\n \r\nHere, the trial court thoroughly examined the venirepersons regarding pretrial publicity.Â  The trial court informed the venirepersons:\r\n\r\n\tNow, ladies and gentlemen, I now need to know what knowledge you might have about this particular case, and ultimately what impact, if any, that knowledge may have upon your ability to serve as a juror in this case.\r\n\tI have read the indictment to you as I have said not because it is evidence nor is it proof of anything that it contains.Â  It is simply a charging paper that tells you or me or anybody else who reads it what this case is all about. \r\n\t\r\n\tBecause I needâ€”now need to know if any of you all know anything about this case, if you have seen or heard or read anything about this case or if you have any knowledge about this case from any source at all, the first thing that I need to know is just simply to identify you by juror name and by number, and then we will go from that point on to the next level of inquiry in a slightly different setting. \r\n\t\r\n\tSo the first thing that I need to know is if you have seen or heard or read anything about this case or if you have any knowledge about the case of any source at all, please stand at this time.\r\n\r\nAt this point, thirty-two venirepersons stood.[3]Â  The trial court then related to these venirepersons:\r\n\r\n\tAll right.Â  Ladies and gentlemen, hereâ€™s what we need to do now.Â  Weâ€™re going to need to inquire of you individually across the hall in the jury room about your knowledge about this case and as I have said, about what impact it will have on you, if any at all.Â  It may not, but we need to know that. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial court then individually examined these venirepersons; the court inquired as to each venirepersonâ€™s (1) exposure to the case, (2) formation of opinions about the case, and (3) ability to set aside those opinions in order to determine with impartiality whether the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Â \r\n \r\nOf the thirty-two venirepersons who said they heard something about the case, a vast majority of them read about the crime in the local newspaper (at the time the crime occurred) and could not remember anything beyond the fact that the crime occurred.Â  All but six venirepersons formed no opinion about the defendantâ€™s guilt or innocence, and of the six venirepersons who formed an opinion, all but two told the trial court they could set aside that opinion to judge the defendantâ€™s guilt or innocence with impartiality.Â  The two venirepersons who could not set aside their formed opinions were excused by the trial court.Â \r\n \r\nAvery then moved the trial court for a change of venue, which the trial court denied, stating:\r\n\r\n\tI think our system recognizes that it is practically impossible in the world that is fraught with . . . news coverage, as ours is, to find the type of informed juror that you would want to be on a jury panel in the first place who has not read or heard or seen something about most high profile cases, and certainly this is one, and so it does not require disqualification on that basis alone. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe question is whether or not they have formed an opinion.Â  And then even beyond that, forming an opinion under the case law is not fatal to their qualification as a juror if they are able to set aside the opinion that they have formed and base their decision in the trial of the case on the evidence presented in court.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tAnd all the people who indicated that they have formed an opinion . . . all of them were . . . people who had the ability, the intellect, in some case the education, to be able to objectively analyze a situation and to base their decision on what they would hear in court, and they told me that. \r\n\t\r\n\tAnd there was no reason in my observation of them for me to believe that they were sandbagging us or that they were being disingenuous or whether they were being untruthful. \r\n\t\r\n\tSo I respectfully note your motion, your renewal of your motion for change of venue, but must deny it on those basis. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Averyâ€™s motion for change of venue.Â  If anything, the learned trial judge took a textbook approach in handling a defendantâ€™s motion for change of venue based on pretrial publicity.Â  The trial court identified the venirepersons who were exposed to pretrial publicity, and individually examined them to determine whether they were so polluted by the pretrial publicity that they could not determine the defendantâ€™s guilt with impartiality.Â  A vast majority of the venirepersons who were exposed to pretrial publicity were not infected by it; that is, they were fully capable of objectively viewing the evidence to determine whether Avery was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  As the trial court articulated, mere exposure to pretrial publicity is not enough to disqualify a venireperson.Â  The venireperson must not only have a formed opinion of the defendantâ€™s guilt, but also be unable to set that opinion aside to view the evidence with impartiality.Â  The trial court excused the two venirepersons who could not do so.Â  The remaining venirepersons, the record demonstrates, could view the evidence impartially.Â  The trial court is affirmed on this issue.\r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Severance \r\nAvery argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for severance because Averyâ€™s co-defendant â€œplaced Avery in a situation of fear and intimidation.â€Â  Avery has not shown prejudice. \r\n \r\n\r\n\tA motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tThere can be no clearly defined rule for determining when a defendant is entitled to a separate trial, because the exercise of discretion means that the decision must be based upon a just and proper consideration of the particular circumstances which are presented to the court in each case.Â  A severance should be granted only when there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of a codefendant or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about a codefendant's guilt.Â  An appellate court should not reverse a conviction achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a reasonable probability that the defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate trial. \r\n\t\r\n\tA defendant who alleges he was improperly tried jointly must show prejudice before this court will reverse his conviction.Â  The general rule allowing joint trials applies with equal force when a defendantâ€™s severance motion is based upon the likelihood he and a codefendant will present mutually antagonistic defenses, i.e., accuse one another of committing the crime.Â  The rule allowing joint trials is not impugned simply because the codefendants may present evidence accusing each other of the crime.\r\n\r\nState v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 656-57, 623 S.E.2d 122, 128-29 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted). \r\n \r\nAvery has not shown how he was prejudiced by the joint trial.Â  His first claim is that he could not confide in his attorney because his co-defendant intimidated him.Â  To the extent this would even serve as a ground for severance, Avery put forth no proof of this intimidation, let alone proof of how, specifically, this intimidation hindered his attorneyâ€™s ability to defend him.Â  Averyâ€™s second claim is that the joint trial violated his right to confront the witnesses against him.Â  In this case, all statements from Averyâ€™s co-defendant that referred to Avery were redacted precisely so Averyâ€™s right to confront his witness would not be impinged.Â  See Bruton v. U.S., 391 U.S. 123 (1968).Â  Because Avery has not demonstrated how he was prejudiced by the joint trial, the trial court is affirmed on this issue. \r\n \r\nC.&nbsp; Confession\r\n&nbsp;Avery argues the trial court erred in ruling his statements to law enforcement were admissible as voluntarily given because at the time they were given Avery was young, intoxicated, and tired.Â  The trial court did not err.\r\n \r\n&nbsp;â€œThe trial judgeâ€™s determination of whether a statement was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, requires an examination of â€˜the totality of the circumstancesâ€™ surrounding the waiver.â€Â  State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990).Â  â€œOn appeal, the conclusion of the trial judge on issues of fact as to the voluntariness of a confession will not be disturbed unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe South Carolina Supreme Court has rejected the position a minorâ€™s inculpatory statement obtained in the absence of counsel, parent, or other friendly adult is per se inadmissible.â€Â  In the Interest of Christopher W., 285 S.C. 329, 330, 329 S.E.2d 769, 770 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  â€œInstead, the court has adopted a totality of the circumstances test: â€˜While the age of the individual is a factor to be taken into consideration, the admissibility of a statement or confession of a minor depends upon its voluntariness, to be determined from the totality of the circumstances under which it is made.â€™â€Â  Id. at 330-31, 329 S.E.2d at 770.Â  \r\n \r\n&nbsp;Here, the trial court found that, under the totality of the circumstances, Averyâ€™s confession was voluntarily given.Â  The record fully supports this finding.Â  Avery was informed of his Miranda rights, and, after meeting with his mother, signed a written waiver of those rights.Â  Further, Avery issued a written confession of the crime.Â  The trial court thoughtfully considered Averyâ€™s age, intellect, and ability to understand his rights before deciding that Avery voluntarily confessed to the crime.Â  The trial court is affirmed on this issue. \r\n \r\nD.&nbsp; Transfer of Jurisdiction\r\n&nbsp;Avery argues the family court erred in failing to consider the appropriate factors before transferring jurisdiction to the trial court.Â  The family court did not err.Â Â \r\n \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œThe appellate court will affirm a transfer order unless the family court has abused its discretion.â€Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 292, 509 S.E.2d 476, 481 (1999).Â  â€œThe serious nature of the offense is a major factor in the transfer decision.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe best interests of the public or of the juvenile may require the juvenile be held accountable as an adult for his criminal conduct.â€Â  Id. at 293, 509 S.E.2d at 481.Â  \r\n \r\n&nbsp;Here, the family court carefully considered the eight factors enumerated by the United States Supreme Court in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), and condoned by our supreme court.Â  See State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 118, 529 S.E.2d 20, 27 (2000) (â€œIn evaluating whether the family court abused its discretion [in transferring jurisdiction to the trial court], we consider the Kent factors and emphasize that the serious nature of the offense is a major factor in the transfer decision.â€).Â  The family court considered the Kent factors as well as the serious nature of the offense (Avery was charged with murder) before transferring jurisdiction to the trial court.Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion.Â Â  \r\n \r\nE.&nbsp; Cruel and Unusual Punishment\r\n&nbsp;Avery argues the transfer from the family court to the trial court violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  The transfer was not unconstitutional. \r\n \r\n&nbsp;Avery cites Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), for the proposition that subjecting a minor to a potential life sentence without parole violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Roper held that the Eighth Amendment prevented states from executing minors under the age of eighteen.Â  It had nothing to say about whether the Eighth Amendment prevents states from imposing a life sentence without parole on minors under the age of eighteen.Â  In any event, Avery was sentenced to thirty-five years imprisonment, not life without parole.Â  Thus, the issue is a non-starter, and Averyâ€™s Eighth Amendment challenge must fail. \r\n \r\nIII.\r\n&nbsp;The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Averyâ€™s motion for change of venue, severance, and suppression of a written confession to law enforcement.Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion in transferring jurisdiction to the circuit court, and the transfer did not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  The judgments of the trial court and family court are\r\n&nbsp;AFFIRMED.\r\n&nbsp;HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â &nbsp;Miranda v.

OF THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA.â€Â  The agreement contains the following pertinent provisions:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\t12.4 Governing Law.Â  The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of South Carolina regardless of the residence or domicile, now or in the future, of any party hereto and notwithstanding any conflicts of laws.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t12.5 Consent to Jurisdiction.Â  Except as otherwise required by law, \r\n\tthe parties to this Agreement hereby agree that the courts of the State of New York shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any matter arising from the interpretation, purpose, effect, or operation of this Agreement, and with regard to all matters associated with operation of the Companyâ€™s business.Â  Except as otherwise required by law, \r\n\tthe parties consent to venue in New York County, New York, and waive any rights they may have to assert jurisdiction or venue in any other court, administrative forum, or other adjudicative body.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\t12.18 Arbitration.Â  Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the requirements of the American Arbitration Association (or successor thereto) (the â€œAAAâ€).Â  \r\n\tAll arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in New York County, New York. . . . The arbitrators shall be directed to apply the governing law of this Agreement in rendering their decision.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â   \r\nIn March 2005, Kriti and Ashley River Properties II initiated arbitration proceedings against Longman and Emerald alleging breach of the operating agreement stemming from a development containing a marina and condominiums located in Charleston, South Carolina, known as Ripley Light Yacht Club Marina and Condominiums.Â  Longman objected to his inclusion in the arbitration, asserting that he signed the agreement in limited joinder only.\r\n \r\nOn July 11, 2005, the New York arbitration panel issued a written order holding it had jurisdiction over Longman.Â  On October 31, 2005, the arbitrators rendered their final arbitration decision, requiring, inter alia, that Emerald relinquish its voting rights in Ashley River Properties II and Kriti was to have the right to purchase Emeraldâ€™s interest in Ashley River Properties II.Â  The order stated: â€œThis Award is in full settlement of all claims and counterclaims submitted in this arbitration.Â  All other claims and counterclaims in this proceeding are denied . . . except ones pertaining to a final accounting in connection with the use of Ashley River Properties II, LLC, funds by Emerald and Longman.â€\r\n \r\nPending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding, Kriti and Ashley River Properties II filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to enforce the right to control Ashley River Properties II.Â  After the first arbitration award was issued, Emerald filed its own lawsuit in the Southern District of New York contesting whether Kriti made a proper tender for the interest awarded in the first decision from the arbitrators.Â  Both lawsuits were assigned to the same judge.Â  Appellantsâ€™ New York counsel filed a motion to dismiss the federal action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  A few days later, Appellantsâ€™ counsel informed the court the parties had agreed to dismiss the federal court actions with prejudice because of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â \r\n \r\nAppellants filed the current action in the Court of Common Pleas for Charleston County on November 9, 2005.Â  An amended complaint was filed on December 30, 2005, seeking to:Â  (1) vacate or modify the arbitration award previously rendered in New York; and (2) judicially dissolve Ashley River Properties II.Â  Additionally, Ashley River Properties I desired a declaration of rights under the operating agreement as a good faith third party purchaser, because it was not a party to the original contract.Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court severed the claims of Ashley River Properties I from the remaining causes of action.Â  Ashley River Properties II and Kriti (collectively â€œRespondentsâ€) moved to dismiss based primarily on the argument that South Carolina courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute.Â  Respondents asserted that New York courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute pursuant to the law of South Carolina and the operating agreement.Â  The circuit court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss, finding the claims should have been brought in New York.Â  Additionally, the circuit court found the claim to judicially dissolve Ashley River Properties II addressed an issue already decided by the arbitrators and was therefore not properly before the court.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move for dismissal based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Â Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 201, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999)). Â A trial judge in the civil setting may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in the pleadings filed with the court. Â Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2001). Â â€œGenerally, in considering a 12(b)(6) motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.â€Â  Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 469, 605 S.E.2d 556, 559 (Ct. App. 2004), affâ€™d 2007 WL 1321978; accord Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995); see also Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 353 S.E.2d 697 (1987) (noting trial court must dispose of a motion for failure to state a cause of action based solely upon the allegations set forth on face of complaint); Williams, 347 S.C. at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 499 (finding trial courtâ€™s ruling on 12(b)(6) motion must be bottomed and premised solely upon allegations set forth by plaintiff).\r\nâ€œA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.â€ Â Flateau, 355 S.C. at 202, 584 S.E.2d at 415; see Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 522 S.E.2d 137 (1999); see also Baird, 333 S.C. at 527, 511 S.E.2d at 73 (declaring that if the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged on the complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper); McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1997) (concluding a motion to dismiss cannot be sustained if the facts alleged in complaint and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case). Â In deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, this court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief. Â See Gentry, 337 S.C. at 5, 522 S.E.2d at 139; see also Cowart v. Poore, 337 S.C. 359, 523 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1999) (explaining that looking at facts in light most favorable to plaintiff, and with all doubts resolved in his behalf, the court must consider whether the pleadings articulate any valid claim for relief).\r\nThe complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action. Â Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987). Â The trial courtâ€™s grant of a motion to dismiss will be sustained only if the facts alleged in the complaint do not support relief under any theory of law. Â Tatum v. Medical Univ. of S.C., 346 S.C. 194, 552 S.E.2d 18 (2001); see also Gray v. State Farm Auto Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 646, 491 S.E.2d 272 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating motion must be granted if facts and inferences reasonably deducible \r\nfrom them show that plaintiff could not prevail on any theory of the case).\r\n \r\nâ€œDismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is appealable.â€ Â Williams, 347 S.C. at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 500. Â Upon review of a dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the appellate court applies the same standard of review implemented by the trial court. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants appeal the dismissal of their action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Appellant Longman contends the circuit court erred in dismissing his causes of action because he only signed the operating agreement in a limited capacity and did not consent to arbitration.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nNotwithstanding their agreement to arbitrate and litigate in New York, Appellants argue that because the partiesâ€™ arbitration is governed by the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (S.C. Ann. Â§Â§ 15-48-10 to -240 (2005)), they may, or must, apply to the courts of South Carolina to modify or vacate the arbitration award.\r\nThe South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (â€œthe Actâ€) states that agreements to arbitrate are â€œvalid, enforceable, and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(a) (2005).Â  Furthermore, South Carolina policy favors arbitrating disputes.Â  Towles v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 34, 524 S.E.2d 839, 842 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. Â Â Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 236, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994).Â  In support of their argument, Appellants cite section 15-48-180 of the South Carolina Code (2005), which states:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe term â€˜courtâ€™ means any court of competent jurisdiction of this State.Â  The making of an agreement described in Â§ 15-48-10 providing for arbitration in this State confers jurisdiction on the court to enforce the agreement under this chapter and to enter judgment on an award thereunder.Â  Unless otherwise provided by the arbitration agreement, when a dispute is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrators shall determine questions of both law and fact.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing in this section confers subject matter jurisdiction to South Carolina courts when, as in the case sub judice, the arbitration is held as agreed by the parties in New York.Â  Appellants entered into an agreement unambiguously providing for arbitration in New York, yet now contend that section 15-48-180, by defining the word â€œcourtâ€ to mean courts of competent jurisdiction of South Carolina, requires that an arbitration subject to the Act may be reviewed by South Carolinaâ€™s courts.Â  However, this is not what the Act requires.Â  Courts in South Carolina are not courts of competent jurisdiction in the face of an arbitration agreement mandating arbitration in New York.Â  \r\n \r\nAgreements such as the one at issue are construed pursuant to the rules of contract interpretation.Â  See generally McPherson v. J.E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183, 33 S.E.2d 501 (1945).Â  The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined by the contract language.Â  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 105, 413 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  If the contractâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force and effect. See id.Â  When a contract is unambiguous, a court must construe its provisions according to the terms the parties used as understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense. C.A.N. Enter., Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988).Â  The forum selection clause contained in section 12.5 of the operating agreement unambiguously provides that the courts of New York shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any matter arising from the operating agreement, which includes those issues litigated in the instant case.\r\nAdditionally, section 15-48-230 of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides that the Act is to be interpreted so as to make its application uniform among the states that adopt it.Â  Courts of other states applying the Uniform Arbitration Act to this issue have uniformly held a courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction to consider motions related to arbitration is dependent upon, and arises from, the partiesâ€™ agreement to conduct the arbitration proceedings in that state.Â  See Government e-Mgmt. Solutions, Inc. v. Am Arbitration Assâ€™n, Inc., 142 S.W.3d 857, 861 (Mo. App. 2004); Atrip v. Samons Constr., Inc., 54 S.W.3d 169, 171 (Ky. App. 2001); Chicago Southshore &amp; South Bend R.R. v. N. Indiana Commuter Transp. Dist., 703 N.E.2d 7, 9 (Ill. 1998); Tru Green Corp. v. Sampson, 802 S.W.2d 951, 953 (Ky. App. 1991).Â  Accordingly, applying both the plain language of the Act and the cases of other states interpreting similar provisions, South Carolina courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider a motion to review an arbitration award issued in a proceeding conducted in New York pursuant to the partiesâ€™ written agreement.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants contend section 15-7-120 of the South Carolina Code (2005) stipulates that contracts that purport to divest South Carolina courts of jurisdiction over matters otherwise within their jurisdiction are unenforceable as a matter of law.Â  Section 15-7-120(A) provides:Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding a provision in a contract requiring a cause of action arising under it to be brought in a location other than as provided in this title and the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure for a similar cause of action, the cause of action alternatively may be brought in the manner provided in this title and the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure for such causes of action.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nHowever, to the extent that this section is construed to invalidate the partiesâ€™ specification as to which court may vacate, modify, or confirm their arbitration award, such a construction would directly conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 9.Â  The Federal Arbitration Act (â€œthe FAAâ€) expressly states that review of an award will be conducted by the court specified by the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  As the Supreme Court of the United States noted in Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Stanford University, 489 U.S. 468, 478 (1989), â€œ[t]he FAA was designed to â€˜overrule the judiciaryâ€™s long-standing refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.â€™â€Â  The FAA requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance with their terms.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, this court has held when section 15-7-120 and the FAA conflict, the FAA preempts and section 15-7-120 is unenforceable.Â  Tritech Elec. v. Hall, 343 S.C. 396, 400, 540 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Because the current lawsuit brought by Appellants clearly conflicts with the FAAâ€™s policy that review be conducted by the court specified in the agreement, section 15-7-120 is preempted.Â  Accordingly, the partiesâ€™ agreement designating New York as the forum in which the parties may litigate is valid and enforceable and requires Appellants to proceed in New York to modify, vacate, or confirm the arbitration award.[1]Â   \r\nII. Longmanâ€™s Claim\r\nLongman contends that because he signed the operating agreement in limited joinder only as to Section 3.9 and 3.10, the circuit court erred in dismissing his causes of action.Â  Longman argues the circuit courtâ€™s severing of Ashley River Properties Iâ€™s claims and allowing them to proceed supports his position that the circuit court should have found he was not a part of the operating agreement.Â \r\n \r\nHowever, the circuit courtâ€™s severing of Ashley River Properties Iâ€™s claims is not inconsistent with its dismissal of Emerald and Longmanâ€™s claims.Â  There is no disputation that: Â (1) Emerald was a party to the arbitration proceeding and a signatory to the operating agreement; and (2) Longman signed the operating agreement and was specifically adjudicated by the arbitration panel to be subject to, and a party in, the arbitration proceeding.Â  Ashley River Properties I did not sign the operating agreement and was not expressly ruled by the arbitration panel to be a party to the proceedings.Â  Furthermore, by severing Ashley River Properties Iâ€™s claims, the circuit court has not ruled on the claims; it simply has not dismissed them.Â  The circuit court did not err in dismissing Longmanâ€™s claims while severing and keeping Ashley River Properties Iâ€™s claims.Â \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that South Carolina does not have subject matter jurisdiction of an arbitration appeal from a decision by a New York arbitration panel where the parties signed a written agreement consenting to jurisdiction for New York courts in all arbitration proceedings.Â  Based upon the foregoing, the circuit court did not err in dismissing Appellantsâ€™ cause of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Additionally, Longmanâ€™s claims were properly dismissed as they too lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Additionally, Appellants argue Emeraldâ€™s claims to judicially dissolve Ashley River Properties II should not have been dismissed because a South Carolina court must entertain a lawsuit to judicially dissolve a South Carolina limited liability company.Â  However, the arbitration award gave Kriti the right to acquire all of Emeraldâ€™s interest in Ashley River Properties II.Â  Therefore, unless the arbitration award is overturned, Emerald has no standing to seek judicial dissolution of the business.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4261","title":"State v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General W. Edgar Salter, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Jason, Maceo, and Jonais Edwards (collectively Defendants) appeal their criminal convictions, contending the trial court erred in 1) failing to follow the proper procedure for a Batson[1] challenge during jury selection; 2) denying Defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss the criminal charges because they were not granted a speedy trial; and 3) denying Defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss based on the Stateâ€™s violation of Rule 3, SCRCrimP.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 11, 2004, the Williamsburg County Grand Jury indicted Jason and Maceo Edwards, each on two counts of murder and one count of possession of a weapon during a violent act.Â  The Grand Jury indicted Jonais Edwards for accessory after the fact of murder.Â  The charges stemmed from the June 19, 2002, murders of Joe Woods and Jimmy Robinson.Â  Arrest warrants for Jonais and Maceo were issued on June 22, 2002, and for Jason on October 31, 2002.Â  Each defendant filed a motion for a speedy trial.Â \r\n \r\nDefendants were tried jointly before a jury in January of 2006.Â  The trial court quashed the first jury and impaneled a second jury in response to the Stateâ€™s Batson motion. Â Jason Edwards[2] moved to dismiss the charges based on alleged violations of his right to a speedy trial and Rule 3, SCRCrimP.Â  The trial court denied the motion to dismiss.\r\nThe jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts.Â  The trial court sentenced Jason to life imprisonment for the murders and five years, concurrent, for possession of a weapon during a violent crime.Â  Maceo received thirty years for the murders and a concurrent five-year sentence for possession of a weapon during a violent crime.Â  The trial court sentenced Jonais to fifteen years for his conviction on accessory after the fact, suspended upon service of seven years in prison, and five years probation.Â  Defendants were credited with time served.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004). Â We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Â State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Williams, 326 S.C. 130, 485 S.E.2d 99&nbsp;(1997); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004). Â This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Â Wilson, 345 S.C. at 1, 545 S.E.2d at 827; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nOn appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion. Â State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 626 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support. Â Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506 (2005); Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 274 S.E.2d 290 (1981); see also Simon v. Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 550, 99 S.E.2d 391, 393-94 (1957) (â€œ â€˜[E]rror at lawâ€™ exists: (1) when the circuit judge, in issuing [the order], was controlled by some error of lawÂ  . . . or (2) where the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, considerations, is without adequate evidentiary support.â€); McSween v. Windham, 77 S.C. 223, 226, 57 S.E. 847, 848 (1907) (â€œ[T]he determination of the court will not be interfered with, unless there is an abuse of discretion, or unless the exercise of discretion was controlled by some error of law.â€).Â \r\n \r\nIn determining whether a party exercised strikes in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), the appellate court must examine the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record surrounding the strikes. Â State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings regarding purposeful discrimination in the exercise of peremptory strikes rest largely on evaluation of demeanor and credibility. Â Southerland v. State, 337 S.C. 610, 524 S.E.2d 833 (1999); State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999).Â  Often the demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination.Â  Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991); Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615-16, 545 S.E.2d at 810. Â Furthermore, a strike must be examined in light of the circumstances under which it is exercised, including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes. Id. at 616, 545 S.E.2d at 810-11.\r\nThe judgeâ€™s findings as to purposeful discrimination are entitled to great deference and will be set aside on appeal only if clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); State v. Adams,&nbsp;322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  The body of law extant in regard to rulings made by a trial judge in a Batson hearing reveals luculently that the appellate court must give deferential treatment to the trial judge on review.Â  State v. Cochran, 369 S.C. 308, 326, 631 S.E.2d 294, 304 (Ct. App. 2006) Anderson, J. concurring in result only.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Batson v. Kentucky\r\nDefendants assert the trial court erred by quashing the first jury panel following a Batson hearing.Â  Specifically, Defendants contend the trial courtâ€™s handling of the Batson hearing effectively placed the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of purposeful discrimination after they had articulated racially neutral explanations for their strikes.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986), the Supreme Court, through the Equal Protection clause, forbade prosecutors from using peremptory challenges to strike jurors because of their race.Â  The purposes of Batson v. Kentucky and its progeny are to protect a defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a jury of his peers, protect each venirepersonâ€™s right not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory reasons, and preserve public confidence in the fairness of the justice system by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection process. State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); State v. Flynn, 368 S.C. 83, 627 S.E.2d 763 (Ct. App. 2006). Â It is unconstitutional to strike a juror on the basis of race or gender.Â  See J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994). Â The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venireperson on the basis of race. Â State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001); Haigler, 334 S.C. at 628, 515 S.E.2d at 90.Â  â€œPurposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire violates a defendantâ€™s right to equal protection because it denies him the protection that a trial by jury is intended to secure.â€ Â Batson, 476 U.S. at 86.Â  A criminal defendant may object to race-based peremptory challenges on equal protection grounds regardless of whether the defendant and potential juror share the same race. Â Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991); Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998). Â Both the State and defendants are prohibited from discriminatorily exercising a peremptory challenge of a prospective juror. Â Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992).\r\nA hearing held pursuant to Batson v. Kentucky is trifurcated. Â In State v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 631 S.E.2d 244 (2006) our supreme court reiterated the proper procedure for conducting a Batson hearing originally set forth in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) [3] (citing Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995)).Â  First, when one party strikes a member of a cognizable racial group, the circuit court must hold a Batson hearing if the opposing party requests one. Â Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810; Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 90. Â In order to raise and preserve a Batson issue, the opposing party must move for the hearing after the jury is selected but before it is sworn. Â State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987). Â This hearing must be held out of the presence of the jury panel and the jury venire. Â Id. Â Second, the proponent of the strike, to successfully rebut the presumption of a Batson violation, must then offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike. Â Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 90-91. Â Third, the opponent of the strike must show that the race-neutral explanation given was mere pretext. Â Id. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91; Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372.\r\nA. The Strike &amp; Batson Request\r\nThe trial judge must hold a Batson hearing when members of a cognizable racial group are struck and the opposing party requests a hearing.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999); Jones, 293 S.C. at 54, 358 S.E.2d at 701. Â Any person, regardless of race, may set forth a Batson claim. Â State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995).Â  Both the defendant and the State can make a Batson motion. Â See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998).\r\nBatson requires a hearing to allow a party the opportunity to make a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination by challenging the other partyâ€™s use of a peremptory strike, and if such discrimination is found, the proponent of the strike has the opportunity to present a neutral explanation for the strike. Â Jones, 293 S.C. at 56-57, 358 S.E.2d at 702-03.\r\nB. Explanation for the Strike\r\nThe proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike. Â Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 90; Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372; State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 519 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App. 1999). Â The explanation need not be clear, reasonably specific, or legitimate; it only needs to be race-neutral. Â State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 471 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997). Â The reason is not required to be persuasive or plausible and may even be silly or superstitious. Â Purkett, 514 U.S. at 765 (1995); State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  While merely denying a discriminatory motive is insufficient, the proponent of the strike need only present race-neutral reasons. Â Id. at 451-52, 481 S.E.2d at 171-72. Â At this stage of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the explanation. Â \r\n\r\n\tThe second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. . . . It is not until the third step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant-the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. Â At that stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination. Â But to say that a trial judge may choose to disbelieve a silly or superstitious reason at step 3 is quite different from saying that a trial judge must terminate the inquiry at step 2 when the race-neutral reason is silly or superstitious. Â The latter violates the principle that the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\r\n\r\nAdams, 322 S.C. at 123-24, 470 S.E.2d at 371-72. Â Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the proponentâ€™s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race-neutral. Â Tucker, 334 S.C. at 8, 512 S.E.2d at 102; Payton, 329 S.C. at 51, 495 S.E.2d at 205.\r\nSouth Carolina rejected the dual motivation doctrine in the Batson context. Â Payton, 329 S.C. at 59-60, 495 S.E.2d at 210. Â We adopted the â€œtaintedâ€ approach whereby a discriminatory explanation for the exercise of a peremptory challenge will vitiate other nondiscriminatory explanations for the strike. Â Id.\r\ni. Examples-Valid Reasons for Strike\r\n1. Demeanor can be considered a racially neutral explanation. Â Counsel may strike venirepersons based on their demeanor and disposition. Â See Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d 907 (4th Cir.1997) (holding the State is allowed to consider tone, demeanor, facial expression, and any other race-neutral factors when striking jurors); State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 413 S.E.2d 323 (1991) (two black males struck because they were late); State v. Wright, 304 S.C. 529, 405 S.E.2d 825 (1991) (struck juror had disinterested attitude and demeanor); Smalls, 336 S.C. at 309, 519 S.E.2d at 797 (finding no discriminatory intent inherent in defense counselâ€™s explanation for striking jurors who appeared to counsel as â€œlooking in a â€˜mean,â€™ â€˜sternâ€™ or â€˜accusatoryâ€™ mannerâ€); State v. Guess, 318 S.C. 269, 457 S.E.2d 6 (Ct. App. 1995) (declaring solicitor could strike venireperson because of demeanor observed during qualification; juror appeared to be â€œslowâ€).\r\n2. Recipient of prior strike. Â See Sumpter v. State, 312 S.C. 221, 223, 439 S.E.2d 842, 844 (1994) (â€œwe find the solicitorâ€™s additional explanation that he struck Mr. Wright because he had struck him earlier in the week is also race neutralâ€).\r\n3. Prior jury service. Â Recent prior jury service is a facially neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike.Â  Casey, 325 S.C. at 453, 481 S.E.2d at 172.\r\n4. Prior criminal conviction. Â A prior criminal conviction is a neutral reason to strike.

Possible criminal record. Â State v. Martinez, 294 S.C. 72, 362 S.E.2d 641 (1987).\r\n6. Prior prosecution by that particular Solicitorâ€™s office. Â State v. Dyar, 317 S.C. 77, 452 S.E.2d 603 (1994); Sumpter, 312 S.C. at 223-24, 439 S.E.2d at 844.\r\n7. Acquaintance with the trial judge. Â See State v. Adams, 322 S.C. Â 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (noting a potential jurorâ€™s acquaintance with the trial judge is a valid reason for exercising a peremptory strike).\r\n8. Relationship with attorney. Â An attorneyâ€™s personal knowledge of and relationship with a prospective juror is a race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike. Â State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999).\r\n9. Relationship with law enforcement or pro-law enforcement attitude. Â A potential jurorâ€™s relationship with a law enforcement official, or a potential jurorâ€™s pro-law enforcement attitude, is a race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike. Â Ford, 334 S.C. at 65, 512 S.E.2d at 504; cf. State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (noting Stateâ€™s explanation that juror was anti-law enforcement was race-neutral).\r\n10. Knowledge of and association with defendant. Â State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990).\r\n11. Unemployment is a race-neutral reason for a strike. Â State v. Green, 306 S.C. 94, 409 S.E.2d 785 (1991).\r\n12. Place or type of employment. Â It is legitimate to strike potential jurors because of their employment. Â Ford, 334 S.C. at 65, 512 S.E.2d at 504; see also Adams, 322 S.C. at 125, 470 S.E.2d at 372 (finding potential jurorâ€™s employment as a court reporter is a valid reason for exercising a peremptory strike). \r\n \r\n13. â€œGeneral instability.â€ Â See State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991) (indicating that Solicitorâ€™s reasons for striking black juror were racially neutral and were not pretext for discrimination where Solicitor stated he struck juror because of her â€œgeneral instability,â€ in that she had changed employment several times after relatively short periods of employment, was unmarried mother of two-year-old, and was still living at her parentsâ€™ home, and juror admitted on voir dire that she had seen outspoken advocate of defendant discussing his case on television).\r\nii. Examples-Invalid Reasons for Strike\r\n1. Desire to seat other venirepersons who have not yet been presented. Â See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998) (stating black murder defendant who exercised nine of his peremptory strikes to remove white prospective jurors and one peremptory strike to remove black prospective juror from panel failed to satisfy requirement of Batson that he offer race-neutral explanation for his exercise of strikes against two of those white prospective jurors; defendant explained he struck those jurors â€œto reach some jurors further down the list,â€ but he offered no explanation as to which jurors he was attempting to seat or why other jurors were more desirable than the two in question); State v. Grandy, 306 S.C. 224, 411 S.E.2d 207 (1991) (emphasizing that solicitor failed to articulate racially neutral explanation in his assertion he excluded prospective black juror because he wanted to seat other venirepersons; solicitor gave no reason why it was desirable to have other venirepersons seated, as opposed to the black juror; effect was same as if no reason was given for striking black juror).\r\n2. Generalization about an entire group. Â See Payton v Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (ruling that striking white juror because she was a â€œredneckâ€ was not valid race-neutral reason on its face; thus, strike was facially discriminatory and violated Batson; term â€œredneckâ€ was racially derogatory term applied exclusively to members of white race, and term stereotyped subgroup of white race without any evidence that each member of group was actually possessed of bias or prejudice).\r\n3. Potential juror who â€œshucked and jivedâ€ to the microphone. Â See State v. Tomlin, 299 S.C. 294, 299, 384 S.E.2d 707, 710 (1989) (â€œThe trial court failed to inquire into or comment on the prosecutorâ€™s explanation that the juror was struck because he â€˜shucked and jived.â€™ The use of this racial stereotype is evidence of the prosecutorâ€™s subjective intent to discriminate and clearly violates the mandates of Batson.â€).\r\n4. Racial stereotypes. Â See Tomlin, 299 S.C. at 298-99, 384 S.E.2d at 710 (noting prosecutor stated he struck juror, a forty-three-year-old black woman, because she walked slow, talked low, and might not be able to withstand trial; rather than inquiring into legitimacy of this explanation, trial court suggested juror had lack of education, was extremely sluggish, and would be a â€œfillerâ€ if seated on the jury; supreme court concluded use of such racial stereotypes violates Batson ).\r\n3. Argument of Mere Pretext\r\nOnce a race-neutral explanation is given, the opponent of the strike must show the explanation was mere pretext to engage in purposeful racial discrimination. State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999); Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372. Â Pretext generally will be established by demonstrating that a similarly situated member of another race was seated on the jury.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 632, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); Adams, 322 S.C. at 123, 470 S.E.2d at 371. Â Under some circumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible that the judge may determine, at this third step of the analysis, that the explanation was mere pretext even without a showing of disparate treatment. Â Payton , 329 S.C. at 55, 495 S.E.2d at 208.\r\nThe uneven application of a neutral reason does not automatically result in a finding of invidious discrimination if the strikeâ€™s proponent provides a race-neutral explanation for the inconsistency. Â See State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (finding State provided a racially neutral explanation for why Solicitor did not strike juror with similar characteristics to one previously stricken). Â Under this prong, persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant. Â Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995).Â  The opponent of the strike carries the burden of persuading the circuit court the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner. Â State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996); see also Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91 (stating burden of persuading court a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on opponent of strike); State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 308, 519 S.E.2d 793, 796 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œAt this third step, the burden returns to the party challenging the strike to establish that the explanation is mere pretext.â€). Â The ultimate question the trial court resolves under this prong is whether the movant has met his burden in demonstrating purposeful discrimination. Â State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\nA racially neutral reason can be negated by showing that the party created a pretext for purposeful discrimination by applying his allegedly racially neutral standard in a discriminatory manner. Â State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 471 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997). Â In State v. Oglesby, 298 S.C. 279, 379 S.E.2d 891 (1989), our supreme court found a Batson violation when the State struck three black women because they were patients of a doctor who was a defense witness, but seated a white woman who was a patient of the same doctor.Â  The court held the Stateâ€™s race-neutral reason for striking the three black women was mere pretext in light of the fact that it seated a similarly situated white woman. Â Id. Â Similarly, in Easler, the court of appeals found a Batson violation when the defendant struck a black man because of his age, but seated a white man within the same age bracket. Â 322 S.C. at 348, 471 S.E.2d at 754.Â  This court held the defendantâ€™s race-neutral reason for striking the black man was negated by the fact he seated several white venirepersons in the same age bracket.Â  Id.\r\nThe determination of whether the minimum quantum of evidence has been produced under this prong is flexible, for the trial courtâ€™s ruling turns on an examination of the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record, including the credibility and demeanor of the strikeâ€™s proponent, and the plausibility of a neutral, but otherwise unpersuasive, reason. Â Casey, 325 S.C. at 452, 481 S.E.2d at 172.\r\nIn deciding whether the opponent of a strike has carried the burden of persuasion, a court must undertake a sensitive inquiry into the circumstantial and direct evidence of intent. Â Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91. Â A strike must be examined in light of the circumstances under which it is exercised, including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes. Â Id.\r\n4. After Batson Motion is Granted\r\nIf the trial judge finds the opposing party has established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and that the proponent of the strike has failed to give race-neutral reasons for the contested strikes, the process of selecting a jury shall start over. Â See State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987). Â Thus, if the trial court finds â€œa juror has been struck in violation of Batson, our supreme court has mandated that the circuit court strike the entire jury and begin the jury selection process de novo.â€Â  State v. Heyward,&nbsp;357 S.C. 577, 580-81, 594 S.E.2d 168, 169&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  The quashed jury will then reenter the jury venire, and jury selection will begin anew from the jury venire.Â  Jones, 293 S.C. at 58 n.3, 358 S.E.2d at 704 n.3.\r\nOnce a juror has been unconstitutionally struck, the jury selection process relative to that juror is tainted. Â State v. Lewis, 363 S.C. 37, 609 S.E.2d 515 (2005). Â If the trial court chooses to reseat the improperly struck juror, the striking party may not use a peremptory strike to remove that juror from the panel a second time. Â Id. Â Therefore, during the subsequent jury selection, the trial judge may prohibit the party who violated Batson from striking a juror who was improperly struck during the previous jury selection.Â  Id.; State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357 (1995).\r\n5.Â  The Factual Record\r\nInitially, we dispose of a procedural matter raised by Defendants.Â  The trial court heard the partiesâ€™ Batson motions with only ten jurors seated on the panel. Â Prior to ruling on the Batson motions, the trial court sought the addition of twenty-five potential jurors to the venire, because the number of available individuals had been exhausted. Â Defendants maintain the trial court should not have heard the Batson motions because a full jury had not been seated.Â  However, Defendants did not preserve this contention with a contemporaneous objection. It is well settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved. Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 633 S.E.2d 505 (2006). Â Moreover, Defendants proffered and argued their own Batson motion, apparently acquiescing to the procedure, despite the deficit in the number of jurors.Â  A party cannot argue one theory at trial and a different theory on appeal.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989). On the merits, Defendants rely on procedure set forth in State v Jones to invalidate the trial courtâ€™s conduct of the Batson hearing.Â  293 S.C. 54, 58, 358 S.E.2d 701, 704 (1987) (â€œIn order to raise and preserve a Batson issue, the defendant must move for a hearing after the jury is selected but before it is sworn.â€).Â  We determine the gravamen of the Jones holding is the preservation of a Batson issue before the jury is sworn.Â  In that regard, the trial court followed the proper procedure in conducting the Batson hearing. \r\n \r\nThe State asserted Defendants exercised nine of their sixteen peremptory challenges to strike white veniremen in violation of Batson v. Kentucky.Â  The trial court found the State identified a racially cognizable group and the burden shifted to Defendants to provide racially neutral justifications for striking the nine potential jurors.Â  \r\n \r\nDefendants explained two of the challenged veniremen had possible connections with another lawsuit in which defense counsel was involved.Â  They struck four other jurors on the basis of relationship, personal knowledge, demeanor, or recent criminal victimization.Â \r\n \r\nDefendants challenged 1) juror 19 because he was self-employed and defense counsel was concerned about self-employed individuals being able to sit and fairly adjudicate a case; 2) juror 50 because he was a newspaper editor and might have knowledge about the case as a newspaper editor or might be writing a story about the case; and 3) juror 131 because she worked for the Department of Motor Vehicles and had interaction with law enforcement.Â  It was defense counselâ€™s policy to strike all State government employees.Â  \r\n \r\nThe State declared Defendantsâ€™ reasons for striking jurors 19, 50, and 131 were mere pretext, averring that 1) juror 39 was, like juror 19, self-employed, but was, nevertheless, seated on the jury; 2) no evidence existed that juror 50 â€œeither wrote an opinion with regard to this case, a story related to this case, or is in any way familiar with the facts of the caseâ€; and 3) the â€œnotion of striking every SCDOT employeeâ€ was â€œsimply a pretextual reason for strikingâ€ juror 131.\r\nIn its Batson motion, the defense claimed four of the Stateâ€™s five strikes were from a racially cognizable group. Â The trial court agreed and instructed the State to present racially neutral justifications.Â  The State offered the following reasons for the disputed strikes: 1) juror 22 lived with a cousin of a defendant; 2) juror 64 knew the parents of a defendant; 3) juror 123 had been arrested multiple times; and 4) juror 111 told the court he was related to one of the victims.Â  \r\n \r\nDefendants disputed the Stateâ€™s reasons as pretextual, complaining: 1) â€œI would like to know how they know number 22 lived with the Defendantsâ€™ cousin?â€; 2) â€œnumber 64 did not say he knew anybody and was related or could not be fair and impartial, but he went to high school with [counsel for State]â€; 3) number 123â€™s arrest record was not a conviction and â€œIâ€™d like to see the rap sheet.â€; and 4) number 111 is â€œrelated to one of the dead guys in this case . . . I canâ€™t imagine a better juror for them.â€ Â Â \r\n\r\n\tThe trial court held: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe court has considered the strikes made by the Defense, and with regard, and Iâ€™ll put the reasons on the record later on, but with regard to the strikes made by the Defendant the court finds that the Defendant has given an [sic] racially neutral explanation for striking jurors number [140, 16, 3, 139, 28, 106]. Â However, I find that the explanation given for striking jurors number 19, 50, and 131 are not racially neutral and for that reason the entire jury panel will be struck, and the jury will be selected again, and the Defense will not be allowed to strike jurors number 19, 50, and 131.Â  With regard to the Defense motion regarding the Stateâ€™s strikes, that being jurors number 22, 64, 123, and 111, I find that the State has given a racially neutral explanation and am denying the Defense motion for striking the jury panel on the basis of \r\n\t\tBatson.Â  Let me give just a little bit about my thinking and the reasons for these ruling [sic] because they somewhat overlap.Â  In my view, personal acquaintance with a juror by the party striking that juror, and knowing how that party thinks and behaves is a legitimate reason, and that was the reason that I am allowing the strike of number 16, because Defense had personal knowledge of that individual.Â  Number 3, personal knowledge of Ms. [Â  ], . . . one hundred six, . . . the same reason I am allowing the strikes by the state of number 64 and 111.Â  Both of them with personal knowledge . . .So I think thatâ€™s [sic] there is personal knowledge that somebodyâ€”not only personal knowledge, personal acquaintance with, and knowing how that person thinks is a legitimate reason. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(jurorsâ€™ names redacted).\r\nAdhering to the trifurcated Batson procedure, the trial court found Defendants peremptorily challenged members of a racially cognizable group, and, upon the motion of counsel, conducted a hearing outside the juryâ€™s presence.Â  The court required Defendants to proffer racially neutral explanations for the preemptory strikes.Â  After Defendantsâ€™ explanations, the State argued Defendantsâ€™ reasons for striking jurors 19, 50, and 131 were mere pretext for engaging in racial discriminatory exclusions. Â The trial court granted the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, finding the State established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and Defendants failed to give race-neutral reasons for the contested strikes. \r\n \r\nWhile the trial court did not specifically articulate reasoning for finding Defendantsâ€™ explanations were not racially neutral, the record contains sufficient justification to conclude there was no abuse of discretion.Â  Defendants struck white juror 19 because he was self-employed and the defense did not want self-employed persons on the jury.Â  However, Defendants seated juror 39, a black woman who, like juror 19, was self-employed.Â  See State v. Oglesby, 298 S.C. 279, 379 S.E.2d 891 (1989) (race-neutral reason for striking the three black women was mere pretext in light of the fact that similarly situated white woman was seated). Â Juror 50 was challenged because he was a newspaper editor and might be writing a story about the crime or might know something about the case as a newspaper editor.Â  Although juror 50â€™s employment qualified as racially neutral, the speculation that he might be impartial because of familiarity with the case was inconsistent with his failure to respond to questioning about familiarity with the case on voir dire. See Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (a discriminatory explanation for the exercise of a peremptory challenge will vitiate other nondiscriminatory explanations for the strike).Â  Defendants struck juror 131, a state employee with the SCDOT, maintaining she had contact with law enforcement and it was their practice to strike all State employees.Â  This generalization about an entire group, without any evidence that every employee of SCDOT is actually biased, is prejudiced, or has a relationship with law enforcement or a pro-law enforcement attitude, was not a valid reason for striking juror 131.Â  See Â Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (strike because juror was member of generalized group without any evidence that each member of group was actually possessed of bias or prejudice not valid race-neutral reason); State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999).\r\nFollowing our supreme courtâ€™s mandate in State v. Heyward, the trial court quashed the entire jury panel, returned the jurors names to the jury venire, and began the jury selection process anew. &nbsp;357 S.C. 577, 580-81, 594 S.E.2d 168, 169&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004); State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987).Â  In addition, the trial court prohibited Defendants, who violated Batson, from striking any juror during the subsequent jury selection who was improperly challenged during the previous jury selection. Â See State v. Lewis, 363 S.C. 37, 609 S.E.2d 515 (2005); State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357 (1995). Â Subsequently, jurors 50 and 131 were seated on the jury chosen to hear the case.\r\nWe hold the trial court properly followed the Batson protocol established in State v. Adams and reiterated in State v. Rayfield, thereby ensuring that ultimately the State, as opponent of the disputed strikes, carried the burden of persuading the court Defendants exercised the strikes in a discriminatory manner. \r\n \r\nII. Speedy Trial\r\nDefendant Jason Edwards argues his right to a speedy trial was violated under the United States and South Carolina constitutions and, therefore, the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the criminal charges against him.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  â€œAny person charged with an offense shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.\r\nThe Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, and the South Carolina Constitution guarantee an accused the right to a speedy trial.Â  State v. Kennedy, 339 S.C. 243, 528 S.E.2d 700, (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d 348 S.C. 32, 558 S.E.2d 527 (2002); State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 480 S.E.2d 64, (1997); State v. Chapman, 289 S.C. 42, 344 S.E.2d 611 (1986). Â â€œThe right to a speedy trial is not a theoretical or abstract right but one rooted in hard reality in the need to have charges promptly exposed.â€Â  Dickey v. Florida, 398 U.S. 30, 37 (1970).Â  The determination of whether or not an accused has been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial depends on the circumstances of each case.Â  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70; State v. Monroe, 262 S.C. 346, 204 S.E.2d 433 (1974). Â â€œA speedy trial does not mean an immediate one . . . it simply means a trial without unreasonable and unnecessary delay.â€Â  State v. Dukes, 256 S.C. 218, 222, 182 S.E.2d 286, 288&nbsp;(1971).\r\nÂ In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 521 (1972), the United States Supreme Court observed that the right to a speedy trial is a vague concept, making it difficult to pinpoint the moment a defendant is denied the right.Â  Therefore, the Court identified four factors to be used in determining whether a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial:Â  1) the length of the delay; 2) the reason the State asserts to justify the delay; 3) when and how the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial; and 4) prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id. at 530-32; see also Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70; State v. Foster, 260 S.C. 511, 514, 197 S.E.2d 280, 281 (1973).Â  Courts must engage in a balancing test with these â€œrelated factors,â€ which â€œmust be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.â€Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 533.Â  South Carolina has recognized these factors and adopted this balancing approach to the speedy trial analysis.Â  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70; Chapman, 289 S.C. at 44, 344 S.E.2d at 612.\r\nThe first factor, length of delay, acts as a threshold requirement.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 530. Â Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, it is not necessary to inquire into the other factors.Â  Id.Â  See Â Foster, 260 S.C. at 514,Â  197 S.E.2dÂ  at 281(explaining that the length of delay is merely a triggering mechanism which brings additional factors into consideration); State v. Tyson, 283 S.C. 375, 323 S.E.2d 770 (1984) (affirming a trial judgeâ€™s denial of a speedy trial motion where there was no detriment other than the incarceration); Brazell, 325 S.C. at 69, 480 S.E.2d at 73 (holding there was no violation of the right to a speedy trial where lack of prejudice negated the long delay and, in the context of pre-indictment delay, the defendant has the burden to show the delay caused substantial actual prejudice to his right to a fair trial).Â  \r\n \r\nA personâ€™s right to a speedy trial arises when he becomes the accused. Â Id., at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70 (citing United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. at 6 (1982); see also United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 313 (1971) (holding Sixth Amendment speedy trial provision does not provide defendant protection until he or she is indicted).Â  In Chapman, 289 S.C. at 44, 344 S.E.2d at 612-13, our supreme court additionally considered the purpose of the speedy trial guarantee in determining when a defendantâ€™s right to a speedy trial began to run.\r\n\r\n\tThe Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is thus not primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time; that interest is protected primarily by the due process clause and by statutes of limitations. Â The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but never the less substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.\r\n\r\nJonaisâ€™s and Maceoâ€™s arrest warrants were issued on June 22, 2002.Â  Jasonâ€™s arrest warrant was issued on October 31, 2002, and all Defendants were indicted on October 11, 2004.Â  Defendantsâ€™ trial began January 30, 2006.Â  The time from Defendantsâ€™ arrests to trial was approximately three years and seven months.Â  However, the duration from the time of Defendantsâ€™ indictments to trial was approximately fifteen months.Â  Jason submitted a motion and supporting memorandum to dismiss his criminal charges based on lack of a speedy trial.Â  The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, explaining its reasoning pursuant to Barker v. Wingo and State v. Brazell:\r\n\r\n\t1) Length of delay.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIâ€™ll be very frank with you, I am troubled by the fact that the delay in this case was three years and seven months since the time of the incident until the matter is brought to trial, and that does cause me a great deal of consternation, and itâ€™s something that I debated long and hard on, but when I reviewed the other three factors I have concluded that that is not sufficient reason to dismiss the case under the right for a speedy trial.Â  Â Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t2) Stateâ€™s reasons for delay.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe record is very vague as to the reasons for the delay . . . none of the dates are in the record that show what the reasons for the delay were.Â  Itâ€™s my view that the moving party bears the burden of pushing and submitting to the Court the length of time, and the unreasonableness of the delay as much as the State must present the reasonableness of the delay.\r\n\t\r\n\t3)Â  When and how Defendant asserted the right.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe only thing in the record is that the Defendant filed a motion for speedy trial and served it on the Solicitor, but there is nothing to show that any effort was ever made to bring the motion to the Courtâ€™s attention, to schedule the motion, or to make a motion for bond reduction or anything else that would have gotten this matter before the Court before today. . . .\r\n\t\r\n\t4)Â  Prejudice to Defendant.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn Barker v. Wingo the interests identified as being protected were to prevent pre-trial incarceration, again it seems like to me if that is a concern to the Defendant a motion could have been made to reduce the bond, or make some adjustment in the bond, nothing was done.\r\n\t\tTo minimize anxiety and concern of the accused, there is really nothing in the record to show that that is a concern, and finally to limit the possibility that the Defense would be impaired, and thatâ€™s the prejudice issue.\r\n\t\tI would find, based on the record before me there is no showing of prejudice. . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDefense counsel raised three issues alleging prejudice by the delay of Defendantsâ€™ trial.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\t1) Toxicology reports indicated alcohol and cocaine in the victimsâ€™ blood.Â  Defense counsel complained the technicians who issued the reports were no longer available to testify.Â \r\n\t\r\n\t2) Defense counsel claimed prejudice by the absence of the testimony from a deceased investigator who had taken a witnessâ€™s statement.Â \r\n\t\r\n\t3) A witness had moved out of state during the delay.Â  Defendants contended the unavailability of the witness affected Defendantsâ€™ ability to impeach.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial court indicated the contents of the toxicology report would be admissible and the unavailability of laboratory witnesses was not prejudicial.Â  Moreover, an expert, other than one who conducted the toxicology tests, if qualified, could render an opinion regarding the results of those tests. Â The court ruled there was no showing that the statement of the witness to the deceased investigator would be used or that the witness would actually testify or need to be impeached.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Furthermore, the trial court noted nothing in the record suggested what the out-of-state witnessâ€™s testimony would be; therefore, it could have benefited either side.Â  Under those circumstances, prejudice to Defendant had not been demonstrated. \r\n \r\nThe trial court conducted a lengthy review of the constitutional considerations at stake in the speedy trial issue.Â  We discern no abuse of discretion in its ruling. \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Delayed Indictments\r\nDefendant Jason Edwards additionally premises his motion to dismiss on the trial courts ruling concerning Rule 3, SCRCrimP.Â  Specifically, Defendant alleges the State violated Rule 3 by allowing over 800 days to elapse between the issue of the arrest warrant and the indictment.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 3(c), SCRCrimP, states:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWithin ninety (90) days after receipt of an arrest warrant from the Clerk of Court, the solicitor shall take action on the warrant by (1) preparing an indictment for presentment to the grand jury, which indictment shall be filed with the Clerk of Court, assigned a criminal case number, and presented to the Grand Jury; (2) formally dismissing the warrant, noting on the face of the warrant the action taken; or (3) making other affirmative disposition in writing and filing such action with the Clerk of Court.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn State v. Culbreath, 282 S.C. 38, 316 S.E.2d 681 (1984) the South Carolina Supreme Court interpreted the rule requiring solicitors to act on a warrant within ninety days of its issue.Â  The court agreed with and affirmed the trial courtâ€™s holding that such a rule was administrative not jurisdictional.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, the court stated a solicitorâ€™s delay does not within itself invalidate a warrant or prevent subsequent prosecution.Â  Id. at 40, 31 S.E.2d at 681.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tHere, the trial court clarified:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tItâ€™s my view that Rule Three is a procedural rule.Â  It deals with when the Magistrate must send the warrants over to the Clerkâ€™s office, when the Clerkâ€™s office must send the warrants to the Solicitorâ€™s office, and when the Solicitor is to present them to the Grand Jury.Â  My view of that is that it is strictly procedural; that it is not substantive, it does not infer any substantive rights, and that is does not affect the jurisdiction of this Court nor the charges if the Rule is not followed.Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s analysis is consistent with South Carolina precedent interpreting Rule 3 SCRCrimP.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court properly adhered to the procedure set forth in State v. Adams in addressing the Batson motions raised in this case.Â  We rule the Barker v. Wingo factors relevant to the speedy trial issue were thoroughly considered and analyzed.Â  In addition, we conclude the trial court did not err in finding the effect of Rule 3, SCRCrimP is administrative rather than substantive.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s rulings on the Batson issues and Defendantâ€™s Motion to Dismiss are \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986).Â  \r\n \r\n[2] The record on appeal provides only Defendant Jason Edwardsâ€™ Motion to Dismiss Criminal Charges. In the Brief on Appeal, Defendantsâ€™ counsel addresses the issues in the Motion on behalf of all appellants.Â  However, the record indicates Maceo and Jonais subsequently obtained separate counsel.Â  Therefore, we only consider the Motion before us filed on behalf of Jason Edwards.\r\n \r\n[3] In State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996), the Court adopted the Batson procedure set forth in Purkett v.

McCormac, of Clemson, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â Â  Annette Holley and Anne Holley-Barnes (collectively the Holleys) appeal an order in which the master-in-equity found the enforcement of a zoning ordinance against them did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1986, the Town of Iva (the Town) adopted a zoning ordinance that included an â€œRSâ€ classification intended to provide â€œhomogeneous and aesthetically harmonious development of single-family dwellings on lots having an area of 10,000 square feet or more.â€Â  One permitted use in the RS area was â€œ[d]etached single-family dwellings, excluding mobile homes.â€ Â After enactment of the ordinance, however, city officials did not regularly enforce the portion of the ordinance not allowing mobile homes in the RS zone even after appellant Annette Holley complained in 1999 during a town council meeting that mobile homes had been placed in areas that were not zoned for them. Â \r\nOn July 1, 2002, the Townâ€™s newly elected mayor and council members were sworn into office.Â  Since then, the Town has prohibited mobile homes in RS areas that were not in place before the new administration took office. Â The decision to enforce the prohibition against mobile homes in RS areas was made without a public vote or public notice, and the Town apparently failed to notify Anderson County, the governmental entity responsible for issuing permits to move mobile homes.Â  \r\n \r\nOn January 15, 2003, Holleyâ€™s daughter, appellant Anne Holley-Barnes, obtained a permit from Anderson County to move her mobile home onto Holleyâ€™s property at 400 Betsy Street.Â  400 Betsy Street is in an RS zone of the Town.Â  In preparation for the move, Holley-Barnes paid a deposit to the Town for sewer and water connections.Â  After the mobile home was moved onto the lot, both a Town police officer and a Town council member informed Holley-Barnes the mobile home was located on property not zoned for mobile homes and she would not be allowed to complete the installation.Â  The Holleys refused to remove the mobile home from the property and continued with the remaining preparations.Â  On January 20, 2003, the mayor and town council notified Holley-Barnes by letter to â€œcease and desist from continuing any further actions to install a mobile home on the property.â€Â  Although the Town sent the Holleys several more letters informing them of the zoning ordinance violation and their rights to appeal the zoning enforcement, the Holleys persisted in their refusal to remove the mobile home from 400 Betsy Street.\r\nOn October 9, 2003, the Town filed a complaint against the Holleys for violating the zoning ordinance.Â  The Holleys answered, asserting the Town was selectively enforcing the zoning ordinance in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.[1]Â  At trial, the town clerk and treasurer acknowledged that, since the adoption of the ordinance in 1986, many mobile homes, including one in which the mayor resided, had been moved into the RS zone.Â  Two witnesses who had both previously served as mayor and as council members testified that, while they were in office, the Town had never enforced the zoning ordinance as to mobile homes.Â  Both witnesses left their offices in 2002.\r\nThe master found the Holleys did not demonstrate the Town did not treat them differently from the way it treated other similarly situated persons, namely those desiring to place mobile homes in RS areas after July 1, 2002, when the members of the current administration took office.Â  Furthermore, the master found the Holleys were in knowing violation of the zoning ordinance since January 15, 2003, and ordered them to remove the mobile home within ninety days.Â  The master declined to assess any fines against the Holleys unless the mobile home was not removed in the time specified, in which case they would be fined $500.00 per day.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the Holleys contend the master erred in failing to find the Town, in enforcing the zoning ordinance against them, denied them equal protection under the law.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a state may not â€œdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.â€[2] Â This clause requires that â€œthe states apply each law, within its scope, equally to persons similarly situated, and that any differences of application must be justified by the lawâ€™s purpose.â€[3] Â It does not dictate that people in different circumstances cannot be treated differently under the law.[4] Â Rather, â€œthe classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.â€[5] Â \r\nOne seeking to show discriminatory enforcement in violation of the Equal Protection Clause must demonstrate arbitrary and purposeful discrimination in the administration of the law being enforced.[6]Â  â€œ[E]ven assuming [a governmental entity] is not enforcing [an] ordinance equally, the fact that there is some unequal treatment does not necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional equal protection violation.â€[7]Â   \r\nIn the present case, we agree with the master that the Holleys failed to establish the Town had a discriminatory purpose in enforcing the zoning ordinance against them.Â  In their brief, the Holleys noted there had been a feud between Annette Holley and the Town since 1999, when Holley began appearing at council meetings to complain about mobile homes installed in violation of the ordinance[8]; however, the record shows the Town has enforced the ordinance against all others attempting to move mobile homes into RS areas since July 1, 2002, even those who sought to replace mobiles homes that were installed in such areas before enactment of the ordinance. \r\n \r\nMoreover, we do not agree with the Holleys that the â€œclass of oneâ€ concept discussed by the United States Supreme Court in Village of Willowbrook v. Olech[9] supports their claim of an equal protection violation. Â Willowbrook concerned a dismissal of a complaint â€œfor failure to state a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection Clause.â€[10] Â The present case, however, involves a merits hearing at which the Town demonstrated to the satisfaction of the hearing tribunal that the efforts of the current council members to enforce the ordinance against those seeking to move mobile homes onto properties in RS areas after July 1, 2002, would further the stated purpose of the ordinance of â€œprovid[ing] a homogeneous and aesthetically harmonious development of single-family dwellings on lots having an area of 10,000 square feet or more.â€[11]Â  Moreover, consistent enforcement of the prohibition against mobile homes in RS areas, regardless of when such enforcement has begun, will eventually result in phasing out all mobile homes in those locations because of the relatively temporary nature of this type of dwelling. Â Â Â \r\nBecause the Town has enforced the ordinance against all others attempting to move mobile homes onto property in the RS areas after the new Town administration took office and because the enforcement was rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective, we affirm the masterâ€™s determination that the application of the zoning ordinance against the Holleys did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.Â \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The pleadings indicate the Holleys unsuccessfully sought to have the Town rezone the property at 400 Betsy Street; however, it was unclear whether the Holleys sought judicial review of the Townâ€™s decision.\r\n[2]Â  U.S. Const. amend.

Anderson and Wanda H. Sturkey as defendants in their individual capacities.Â  We reverse and remand.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband married Betty R. Williams (Wife) in 1981.Â  Both had been married before.Â  Before the marriage, Husband owned as his separate property a lot and residence located at 237 Lowry Road in Lexington, South Carolina.Â  Husband had purchased this property with a Veterans Administration loan in his name.\r\nDuring the early years of their marriage, Husband drank to excess regularly.Â  Around 1982, Husband was committed to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health for treatment of various problems, most of which concerned his drinking. \r\n \r\nHusband maintained that, because of his memory deficits and vulnerability, he thereafter depended on Wife to handle his financial dealings.Â  Regardless of whether this assertion is correct, it appears undisputed that most of his income was deposited into a joint account on which Wife could write checks. \r\n \r\nApparently with the consent of both Husband and Wife, Respondent Anderson, one of Wifeâ€™s daughters from a prior marriage, moved with her family into the residence on the Lowry Road property with the understanding that she pay rent.Â  Husband and Wife then moved into a mobile home on the same lot.Â  Thereafter, according to Husband, Respondent Sturkey, another of Wifeâ€™s daughters from her prior marriage, moved her mobile home to the Lowry Road property on the condition that she also pay rent.\r\nIn 2003, Husband, while measuring the residence so he could have aluminum siding installed, was verbally accosted by Anderson, who asserted she now owned the residence and he could not have anything to do with it.Â  Husband then went to the Lexington County Registrar of Deeds and located two deeds, one dated July 1, 1983, and the other dated January 26, 1995.Â  In the first deed, Husband purportedly conveyed the Lowry Road property to Wife.Â  In the second deed, Wife in turn transferred the property to Anderson and Sturkey.Â  According to Husband, further investigation revealed that neither Anderson nor Sturkey paid rent and both had misappropriated money from the joint checking account.\r\nHusband commenced this action against Wife, Anderson, and Sturkey on July 11, 2003.Â  In his pleadings, Husband alleged he â€œdid not recall signingâ€ the 1983 deed and â€œbelieve[d] he was tricked into signing said document.â€Â  Husband requested, among other relief, an equitable division of the assets of the marriage, including the Lowry Road property and rental income from Anderson and Sturkey. Â On September 10, 2003, counsel for Wife,[1] Sturkey, and Anderson filed responsive pleadings contending, among other defenses, the action should be dismissed because Husband failed to allege sufficient facts to support an action for fraud. Â Â \r\nA final hearing in the matter took place on August 29 and 30, 2005.Â  By order dated October 13, 2005, the family court, although finding the action was for equitable division and declining to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, granted the motion to dismiss insofar as it concerned the Lowry Road property on the ground that Husbandâ€™s allegations concerning this asset did not include the requisite elements of a cause of action for fraud.Â  In addition, the family court dismissed Sturkey and Anderson as defendants in their individual capacities.[2]Â  Following the denial of his motion to reconsider, Husband filed this appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Husband contends that, because the family court had subject matter jurisdiction to apportion property owned by third parties, it erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraud and in dismissing Anderson and Sturkey as individual defendants in this action.Â  We agree.[3]\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 20-7-473 defines marital property as â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . regardless of how legal title is held.â€[4]Â  As noted by the supreme court in Sexton v. Sexton, â€œ[t]his section specifically provides for the possibility that marital property could be titled in a third party.â€[5] Â \r\nIn the present case, neither Husband nor Wife has held legal title to the disputed property since 1995.Â  Nevertheless, under Sexton, the family court in this case had subject matter jurisdiction to determine if the Lowry Road property was marital property as defined in section 20-7-473 and to join Anderson and Sturkey as defendants in their individual capacities based their position as record owners of the property under the 1995 deed.Â \r\n \r\nIn our view, the complaint adequately alleges the Lowry Road property was subject to equitable division.Â  Whether Husband knowingly deeded the property to Wife in 1983 or she deceived him into transferring it to her, the conveyance of the property from Husband to Wife during the partiesâ€™ marriage would have been sufficient reason to classify it as marital property, but for Wifeâ€™s purported conveyance to Anderson and Sturkey.[6] Â \r\nFurthermore, because Anderson and Sturkey hold title to the property, we agree with Husband they should not have been dismissed as defendants to this lawsuit.Â  As the supreme court held in Sexton, \r\n \r\n\r\n\t[W]hen property is alleged to be marital property, but is owned by a third party, the Family Court has the subject matter jurisdiction to join all persons with a possible interest in the property as parties to the action and to determine if the property constitutes marital property as defined in Â§ 20-7-473.Â  If it is determined that the property is marital property, then the Family Court has the authority to determine the partiesâ€™ equitable rights therein.[7]Â  Â \r\n\r\nAs evident in the above-quoted passage, to join a third party in an action for equitable distribution, a litigant needs only to make allegations to support a contention that property titled in the third partyâ€™s name is actually marital property.Â  Moreover, the language in this passage indicates that, if the requisite allegation is made, the party seeking equitable division is entitled at least to a determination by the family court as to whether the property in question is in fact a marital asset.[8]Â  In the present case, the complaint alleges facts that, if substantiated at trial, would support a finding that Wife â€œacquiredâ€ the Lowry Road property during the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  We therefore hold the family court prematurely dismissed Husbandâ€™s claim for equitable distribution of the Lowry Road property.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn determining that Husband was entitled to have the family court determine whether or not the Lowry Road property was a marital asset, we are mindful of the caveat in Panhorst v. Panhorst, wherein this court cautioned that section 20-7-473, in specifying â€œthat the marital estate must be identified as of a fixed date,â€ . . . has the effect of â€œforeclos[ing] spouses from litigating every expenditure or transfer of property during the marriageâ€ and preventing marital litigants from â€œresurrectingâ€ foolish, selfish, or unprofitable transactions â€œto gain an advantage in the equitable distribution.â€[9] Â We note, however, that in Panhorst this court also recognized that cases involving â€œfraudulent transfers or dissipation of marital assets in contemplation of the breakdown of the marriageâ€ are distinguishable.[10]Â  Moreover, in following the supreme courtâ€™s directive in Sexton, we hold that a party seeking equitable division of an asset need only set forth allegations to support a finding that the asset is marital property in order to have the family court make this threshold determination.[11]\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold Husband is entitled to have the family court determine whether the Lowry Road property is a marital asset and, if so, to have the court determine the rights of all parties claiming an interest to it.Â  For this reason, we also hold Anderson and Sturkey should remain parties to this action pending further determination by the family court as to the marital nature of the property.\r\n&nbsp;REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Wife died on September 4, 2003, and her estate was later substituted as a party Defendant through her personal representative.\r\n[2]Â  In the appealed order, the family court granted Husband his personal property that was located at the Lowry Road property and a cemetery plot in West Columbia, South Carolina.Â  The court also dismissed Husbandâ€™s claim for damages on the ground that it lacked statutory authority.\r\n[3]Â  Husband does not appeal the dismissal of his claim for damages; therefore, we do not consider whether he can proceed on his claims concerning rent payments, funds allegedly misappropriated by Anderson and Sturkey, or damages allegedly caused by Sturkey in placing a right-of-way on the Lowry Road property.\r\n[4]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added).\r\n[5]Â  Sexton v. Sexton, 298 S.C. 359, 361, 380 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1989); see also S.C. Code Ann. 20-7-420(19) (1985) (granting the family court jurisdiction to â€œbring in and make parties to any proceedings pending in the court any person or persons . . . whose presence to the proceedings may be found necessary to complete determination of the issues therein . . . .â€).\r\n[6]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1) (Supp. 2006) (exempting â€œproperty acquired by either party by . . . giftâ€ from inclusion in the marital estate, but noting the gift must be â€œfrom a party other than the spouseâ€).\r\n[7]Â  Â Sexton, 298 S.C. at 361-62, 380 S.E.2d at 834 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n \r\n[8]Â  As noted in Sexton, â€œ[i]f the property is found to be marital property, the Court has the authority to apportion it among the parties. In contrast, if it is not marital property, the owners of the property may be dismissed as parties.â€Â  Id. at 361, 380 S.E.2d at 834.\r\n[9] Â Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 105, 390 S.E.2d 376, 379 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\n[10] Id. at 105, 390 S.E.2d at 379.\r\n[11] It is for this reason that we reject Respondentsâ€™ argument that Husbandâ€™s action, insofar as it concerned the Lowry Road property, was incorrectly filed in the family court.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4264","title":"Law Firm of Paul L.

Erickson, of Asheville, N.C., for Appellant.\r\n        Carolyn R. Hills, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Â Paul\r\n  L. Erickson appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order denying enforcement of a North Carolina default judgment based on the foreign courtâ€™s lack of personal\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJames and Mona Boykin (the Boykins) are\r\n  residents of Horry County, South Carolina and the parents of an autistic son.Â  In 1999, they hired Erickson, a North Carolina attorney licensed to\r\n  practice law in South Carolina, to represent them in an action against the Horry County  School District for failure to provide certain services to their son.\r\nErickson\r\n  represented the Boykins at a four-day administrative hearing before the School\r\n  District, at an appeal before the Horry County Circuit Court, and before a\r\n  federal court in Florence.Â  The action was ultimately unsuccessful; thus, the Boykins\r\n  were required to pay Erickson a discounted rate of $50 per hour for legal\r\n  services rendered.Â  Although the Boykins had already paid him over\r\n  $20,000 in legal fees, Erickson maintained they still owed $21,660.00, plus\r\n  interest.Â  The Boykins refused to pay Erickson the remaining legal fees\r\n  he claims they owe. \r\nOn August 18, 2003, Erickson obtained a\r\n  default judgment against the Boykins in Buncombe County, North Carolina.Â  On\r\n  December 6, 2004, Erickson filed to have the foreign judgment enforced in Horry County.Â  In response, the Boykins moved for relief of enforcement on the basis\r\n  that North Carolina lacked personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on June 1, 2005, Ericksonâ€™s attorney argued North\r\n  Carolina had personal jurisdiction over the Boykins because they visited his\r\n  office in North Carolina and because the attorney/client agreement between Erickson and the Boykins provided that any action to collect fees would\r\n  take place in Buncombe County, North Carolina.Â  The Boykinsâ€™ attorney denied\r\n  her clients ever traveled to North Carolina to meet with Erickson and objected\r\n  to the contract being entered into evidence because it had not been filed with\r\n  the default judgment and was a hearsay document.Â  The Boykinsâ€™ attorney also\r\n  argued that the Boykins had no contact with the State of North Carolina and\r\n  that both parties contemplated that any action taken by Erickson on behalf of\r\n  the Boykins would occur in South Carolina.Â Â  \r\nBy order dated June 1, 2005, the circuit court granted the\r\n  Boykinsâ€™ motion for relief, provided the Boykinsâ€™ attorney with one week to\r\n  submit a proposed written order, and provided Ericksonâ€™s attorney with one week\r\n  to respond to the proposed written order.Â  On June 15, 2005, Erickson submitted\r\n  to the circuit court an affidavit regarding solicitation and services performed\r\n  and a request for the court to take judicial notice of the North Carolina complaint\r\n  and the attorney/client agreement.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court issued its final order on June 17, 2005. Â In\r\n  this order, the circuit court noted the attorney/client\r\n  agreement had not been\r\n  admitted into evidence because it was a hearsay document and lacked proper\r\n  foundation. The circuit court further found no evidence had been offered to\r\n  show the Boykins had established the requisite minimum contacts to confer\r\n  personal jurisdiction upon the North Carolina court.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  circuit court granted the Boykins relief from the North Carolina judgment.\r\nOn\r\n  June 18, 2005, Erickson filed a motion for reconsideration and again requested\r\n  the circuit court consider the affidavit and take judicial notice of the\r\n  documents.Â  On August 26, 2005, the circuit court issued an order denying\r\n  Ericksonâ€™s motion for reconsideration, his request for the court to take\r\n  judicial notice of the documents, and his request for the court to consider the\r\n  affidavit.Â  In that order, the circuit court found the documents were not\r\n  admissible because they were submitted after the hearing.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to\r\n  enforce a foreign judgment is an action of law.â€Â  Sec. Credit Leasing, Inc. v. Armaly, 339 S.C. 533, 539, 529 S.E.2d 283, 286 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000).Â  On appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact will not be disturbed if there is any evidence which\r\n  reasonably supports the findings.Â  Carson v. Vance,\r\n  326 S.C. 543, 547, 485 S.E.2d 126, 128 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nErickson\r\n  argues the circuit court erred by failing to give full faith and credit to the North Carolina judgment.Â  He maintains the North Carolina judgment was valid and, as such,\r\n  bore a presumption that personal jurisdiction was proper.Â  He also contends the\r\n  Boykins failed to carry the necessary burden of proof to overcome the\r\n  presumption.Â Â Â  Erickson further alleges error in the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  acceptance and entry of an order provided by the Boykinsâ€™ attorney which\r\n  contained findings he claims are unsupported in the record.Â  Lastly, Erickson argues\r\n  the circuit court erred by failing to take judicial notice of numerous\r\n  documents and facts submitted to the circuit court after the hearing, and he\r\n  requests that this court take judicial notice of the same.Â  We disagree with\r\n  each of Ericksonâ€™s arguments and affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\nDEFAULT JUDGMENT\r\nThe Full Faith and\r\n  Credit Clause provides that â€œFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each state\r\n  to the . . . judicial proceedings of every other State.â€Â  U.S. Const. Art. IV. Â§ 1.Â  This clause requires that judgments of the courts of one state are given\r\n  the same faith and credit in another state.Â  Hamilton v. Patterson, 236\r\n  S.C. 487, 492, 115 S.E.2d 68, 70 (1960) (citation omitted). Â Where a judgment\r\n  is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Full Faith and Credit\r\n  Clause precludes any examination into the merits of the case â€œor the validity\r\n  of the legal principles on which the judgment is based.â€Â  Id.Â  However, the\r\n  â€œFull Faith and Credit Clause does not prevent the litigation of personal jurisdiction in an action\r\n  to enforce a foreign judgment.Â  Colonial Pacific Leasing Corp. v. Taylor,\r\n  326 S.C. 529, 532, 484 S.E.2d 595, 596-7&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  Â Â \r\nThe Supreme\r\n  Court of South Carolina has recognized that a judgment rendered by a court\r\n  presumes subject matter and personal jurisdiction, and if the judgment â€œappears\r\n  on its face to be a record of a court of general jurisdiction, such\r\n  jurisdiction overâ€ the case is presumed â€œunless disproved by extrinsic\r\n  evidence, or by the record itself.â€Â  Taylor v. Taylor, 229 S.C.\r\n  92, 97, 91 S.E.2d 876, 879 (1956) (citations omitted).Â  As part of the Uniform\r\n  Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, South Carolina has enacted Â§15-35-940 which\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)Â \r\n    The judgment debtor may file a motion for relief from, or notice of defense to,\r\n    the foreign judgment . . . on any . . . ground for which relief from a judgment\r\n    of this State is allowed.\r\n  (B)Â  If\r\n    the judgment debtor has filed a motion for relief or notice of defenses, then\r\n    the judgment creditor may move for enforcement or security of the foreign\r\n    judgment as a judgment of this State, if all appeals of the foreign judgment\r\n    are finally concluded and the judgment is not further contested.Â  The judgment\r\n    creditorâ€™s motion must be heard before a judge who has jurisdiction of the\r\n    matter based upon the amount in controversy as the amount remaining unpaid on\r\n    the foreign judgment.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply.Â  The\r\n      judgment creditor has the burden of proving that the foreign judgment is\r\n      entitled to full faith and credit.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940 (2005)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThis statute was enacted by\r\n  the Legislature to extend greater protection to South Carolina citizens in the\r\n  enforcement of foreign judgments and impacts the earlier presumption of\r\n  validity laid out in South Carolina case law.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  this statutory scheme, the presumption of regularity ends when the judgment\r\n  debtor files a motion for relief from or notice of defense to the foreign\r\n  judgment.Â  At that time, the burden of proving the foreign judgment is entitled\r\n  to full faith and credit shifts to the judgment creditor.[1]Â  See The Jay Group, Ltd. v. The Bootery of Haywood Mall, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 114, 116, 515 S.E.2d 542, 543 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The judgment creditorâ€™s\r\n  burden extends to situations where the judgment debtor challenges the validity\r\n  of the foreign judgment based on a lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the Boykins, who did not make a general appearance in North Carolina, moved for relief from enforcement of the foreign judgment.Â  Upon this\r\n  motion, pursuant to Â§15-35-940(B) the burden of proving the North Carolina\r\n  judgment was entitled to full faith and credit shifted to Erickson.Â  The only evidence\r\n  offered by Erickson at the hearing, the attorney/client agreement, was\r\n  excluded by the circuit court.[2] Â A full review of the record shows only that the Boykins are South Carolina\r\n  residents who hired Erickson to represent them in litigation in South Carolina.Â  The certified copy of the foreign judgment which Erickson filed with the\r\n  court is devoid of any statement or explanation of personal jurisdiction over\r\n  the Boykins.Â  Therefore, Erickson has failed to meet his burden of proving that\r\n  the foreign judgment was entitled to full faith and credit. \r\nThe dissent\r\n  would reverse based on a finding that Erickson, the judgment creditor, had not\r\n  moved for enforcement of the foreign judgment, and therefore, the burden had\r\n  not shifted to Erickson to prove the foreign judgment was entitled to full\r\n  faith and credit.Â  This finding is rooted in the language of Â§15-35-940(B)\r\n  which states:\r\n\r\n  If the\r\n    judgment debtor has filed a motion for relief or notice of defenses, then the\r\n    judgment creditor may move for enforcement or security of the foreign judgment\r\n    as a judgment of this State, if all appeals of the foreign judgment are finally\r\n    concluded and the judgment is not further contested.Â  The judgment creditorâ€™s\r\n      motion must be heard before a judge who has jurisdiction of the matter based\r\n      upon the amount in controversy as the amount remaining unpaid on the foreign\r\n      judgment.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply.Â  The judgment\r\n    creditor has the burden of proving that the foreign judgment is entitled to\r\n    full faith and credit.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940\r\n  (2005) (emphasis added).Â  The dissentâ€™s reasoning is essentially that because\r\n  the sentence emphasized above is expressly limited to only the judgment\r\n  creditorâ€™s motion the two sentences which follow are likewise limited.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  though the second sentence of Subsection (B) is expressly limited to only the\r\n  judgment creditorâ€™s motion, it does not follow that the remaining sentences are\r\n  subject to the same limitation.Â Â  This is exemplified by the third sentenceâ€™s\r\n  mandate that the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply.Â  Clearly the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure would apply to motions made by either party.Â \r\n  Under the statute before us, we fail to see why the assignment of the burden of\r\n  proof would not likewise apply to both motions.Â  Furthermore, the only South\r\n  Carolina case to ever expressly address the burden of proof in a judgment\r\n  creditorâ€™s motion for relief under Â§ 15-35-940 states the burden is on the\r\n  judgment creditor to prove the foreign judgment is entitled to full faith and\r\n  credit.Â  See The Jay Group, Ltd. v. The Bootery of Haywood Mall, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 114, 116, 515 S.E.2d 542, 543 (Ct. App. 1999).Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nTHE COURTâ€™S ORDER\r\nErickson\r\n  argues the seventh finding of fact in the circuit courtâ€™s order was erroneous.Â \r\n  In its order, the circuit court found: \r\n\r\n  There\r\n    was no evidence presented that any services rendered by Plaintiff on behalf of\r\n    the Defendant[s] took place in North Carolina. Â To the contrary, it was\r\n    undisputed that all meetings, hearing, filings, and other contact incident to\r\n    Plaintiffâ€™s services took place in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAs\r\n  laid out in Ericksonâ€™s brief, his allegation of error appears to focus on whether\r\n  or not it was disputed that a meeting between the parties took place in North Carolina.Â  At the hearing, Ericksonâ€™s attorney stated that the Boykins had traveled\r\n  to North Carolina to meet with his client.Â  As correctly pointed out by\r\n  Ericksonâ€™s attorney in his motion for reconsideration and by Erickson himself\r\n  in his reply brief, an argument by a partyâ€™s attorney is not evidence.Â  See Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 403 S.E.2d 127 (Ct. App. 1991). Â The burden of proving the foreign judgment was entitled to full faith and credit fell on Erickson.Â  Since Ericksonâ€™s attorneyâ€™s argument was not\r\n  evidence, the circuit court judge correctly found there was no evidence\r\n  presented to show Erickson had performed any services on behalf of the Boykins\r\n  in North Carolina.\r\nJUDICIAL NOTICE\r\nErickson\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in failing to take judicial notice of numerous\r\n  documents and facts, and he requests this court take judicial notice of the\r\n  same.Â  We find no error and deny his request.Â  \r\nErickson requested\r\n  that the circuit court take judicial notice of the complaint he filed in North Carolina, the attorney/client agreement between the parties, and an affidavit stating\r\n  the Boykins solicited his services and attesting to the number of hours he\r\n  spent working on the case. Â By\r\n  order dated August 26, 2005, the circuit court denied these requests.Â  In that\r\n  order, the circuit court found the documents were not admissible because they\r\n  were submitted after the hearing. Â Â \r\nRule\r\n  201, SCRE, governs the taking of judicial notice and provides:\r\n\r\n  (a)\r\n    Scope of Rule. This rule governs\r\n    only judicial notice of adjudicative facts.\r\n  (b)\r\n    Kinds of Facts. A judicially noticed fact\r\n    must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in\r\n    that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the\r\n    trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to\r\n    sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\r\n  (f)\r\n    Time of Taking Notice. Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding. . . .\r\n\r\nWhen a court takes judicial\r\n  notice of a fact it â€œadmit[s] into evidence and consider[s], without proof of\r\n  the facts, matters of common and general knowledge.â€ Moss v. Aetna Life Ins.\r\n    Co.,&nbsp; 267 S.C. 370, 377, 228 S.E.2d 108, 112&nbsp;(1976) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  In order for a fact to be subjected to judicial notice, the fact\r\n  must be of â€œsuch common knowledge that it is\r\n  accepted by the general public without qualification or contention, or its\r\n  accuracy may be ascertained by reference to readily available sources of\r\n  indisputable reliability.â€Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 94, 561\r\n  S.E.2d 610, 615&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (citation omitted). \r\nThe facts included\r\n  in the documents presented by Erickson are not the type accepted without\r\n  qualification or contention, and, in fact, the Boykins contest the facts\r\n  contained in these documents.Â  Accepting these facts into evidence without\r\n  proof would be improper. Â Moreover, Erickson did not submit these documents or\r\n  make his request for the circuit court to take judicial notice until after the circuit\r\n  court had granted the Boykinsâ€™ motion for relief. Â By form order dated June 1,\r\n  2005 and filed June 6, 2005, the circuit court granted the Boykinsâ€™ motion for\r\n  relief.Â  Erickson did not submit the documents or request the court to take\r\n  judicial notice of the documents until June 15, 2005.Â  Accordingly, the circuit\r\n  court denied Ericksonâ€™s motion because it was filed after the hearing.Â  Given\r\n  the dispute in this case and the time at which the documents were submitted and\r\n  the request made, we find the doctrine of judicial notice is not properly\r\n  applicable to these documents.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Erickson requests this court take judicial notice of certain facts showing the\r\n  majority of the time he spent working on the case was in North Carolina.Â  It is\r\n  difficult to discern from the record if Erickson requested the circuit court\r\n  take judicial notice of these particular facts.Â  However, even if these facts\r\n  were properly presented to the circuit court, we find no error in the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s failure to take judicial notice.Â  Furthermore, we refuse to take\r\n  judicial notice of these facts as they are irrelevant to the determination of\r\n  the matter before this court.Â  Ericksonâ€™s travel time and time spent in North Carolina as opposed to time he spent in South Carolina have no bearing on whether North Carolina has personal jurisdiction over the Boykins.Â  See Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958) (â€œThe unilateral activity [within the forum state] of\r\n  those who claim some relationship with a non-resident defendant cannot satisfy\r\n  the requirement of contact with the forum State.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe appellant failed to present competent evidence to\r\n  show that the North Carolina judgment was entitled to full faith and credit;\r\n  therefore, the judgment of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nHUFF, STILWELL,\r\n  KITTREDGE, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\nGOOLSBY,\r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which CURETON and LEE, A.JJ., concur. \r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would\r\n  reverse the judgment below, principally because the trial judge placed the\r\n  burden of proof upon the wrong party.Â  The judgment debtors bore that burden in\r\n  this instance, not the judgment creditor, and the judgment debtors failed to\r\n  carry that burden.Â  \r\nThe appellant Law\r\n  Firm of Paul L. Erickson, P.A., filed with the clerk of court of Horry County\r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-920(A) (2005)[4] a properly authenticated copy of a North Carolina judgment it obtained against\r\n  the respondents James R. Boykin and Mona S. Boykin, two South Carolina\r\n  residents, on August 19, 2003, in Buncombe County, North Carolina. Â An\r\n  affidavit, which the firmâ€™s president executed and which indicated, among other\r\n  things, the judgment was uncontested and wholly unsatisfied, accompanied the\r\n  copy of the judgment.[5]Â \r\n  The Law Firm thereafter served the notice required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-35-930(A) (2005) upon the Boykins.\r\nAs allowed by S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940(A) (2005),[6] the Boykins filed a â€œMotion for Relief from Enforcement of Foreign Judgment,â€\r\n  contesting the North Carolina judgment on the ground â€œthat the North Carolina court lacked personal jurisdiction over the [Boykins].â€Â  The Law Firm did\r\n  not move, as it could have done, â€œfor enforcement or security of the foreign\r\n  judgment as a judgment of this State.â€[7]\r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing[8] upon the Boykinsâ€™ motion,[9] the trial court granted the Boykinsâ€™ â€œmotion for reliefâ€ after finding â€œno\r\n  evidence offered . . . suggest[ed] that the [Boykins] ever established any\r\n  contact with North Carolina . . . sufficient to rise to the level of the\r\n  â€˜minimum contactsâ€™ required.â€ Â The Boykins, however, offered no evidence at all\r\n  at the hearing either by testimony or by affidavit regarding the issue of\r\n  personal jurisdiction, notwithstanding the file containing a copy of the foreign\r\n  judgment, which appears regular on its face, had been produced to the trial\r\n  court.[10]Â \r\n  Neither did the Boykins point to anything in the record that supported their\r\n  contention.Â  What they did offer was argument of counsel, which, of course, is\r\n  not â€œevidence.â€[11]\r\nThe rule that â€œ[a] judgment pronounced by a court of\r\n  record of general jurisdiction, regular on its face, carries with it a\r\n  presumption of validityâ€[12] is so elementary that citation to the rule ought not to be necessary.Â \r\n  Consistent with this rule is the one that â€œ[a] party seeking to enforce a\r\n  judgment usually is aided by certain presumptions as to matters such as\r\n  jurisdiction, and ordinarily establishes his or her case by producing the\r\n  judgment.â€[13]Â \r\n  Moreover, â€œa party who controverts the validity of a judgment generally bears\r\n  the burden of showing such invalidity by proper evidence.â€[14]Â \r\n  With respect to foreign judgments in particular, such a judgment is presumed to\r\n  be valid where â€œrendered by a court of general jurisdictionâ€;[15] and the party attacking the foreign judgment bears the burden of proving â€œit\r\n  should not be given full faith and credit.â€[16]\r\nIn South Carolina, â€œ[a] judgment creditor may move for\r\n  enforcement . . . of the judgment as a judgment of this Stateâ€[17] where the judgment debtor, as here, has filed a motion to be relieved from a\r\n  foreign judgment. Â If the judgment creditor&#9472;here, the Law Firm&#9472;does\r\n  so move, our statute plainly mandates the motion for enforcement be â€œheard\r\n  before a judge who has jurisdiction of the matter,â€ prescribes the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure are to apply, and places upon the judgment\r\n  creditor â€œthe burden of proving that the foreign judgment is entitled to full\r\n  faith and credit.â€[18]\r\nOur\r\n  stateâ€™s version of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act does not\r\n  alter in any way material in this instance the general rule regarding who has\r\n  the burden of proof.Â  This is because the judgment creditor here has not yet moved\r\n  to enforce its foreign judgment against the judgment debtors, the Boykins.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  we read the record, all that occurred here was that (a) the Law Firm filed with\r\n  the appropriate South Carolina clerk of court pursuant to sec. 15-35-920(A) a\r\n  copy of an authenticated copy of its foreign judgment along with a supporting\r\n  affidavit; (b) the Law Firm served a notice of the filing pursuant to sec.\r\n  15-35-930(A) upon the Boykins; (c) the Boykins filed a motion for relief from\r\n  the foreign judgment pursuant to sec. 15-35-940(A);[19] and (d) the Boykins at the hearing on their motion failed to rebut the\r\n  presumption that the Law Firmâ€™s North Carolina judgment is entitled to full\r\n  faith and credit.Â  The presumption arose when the Law Firm filed with the clerk\r\n  of court and served on the Boykins a â€œfiled, stamped copyâ€[20] of a foreign judgment that was properly authenticated pursuant to Rule 44(a)(2),\r\n  SCRCP,[21] a copy of which was included in the file at the hearing and was before the\r\n  trial court.Â  Under these circumstances, the trial court should not have\r\n  granted the Boykins the relief that they sought because they, not the Law Firm,\r\n  had the burden of proof and they offered no evidence and pointed to nothing in\r\n  the record, as it existed at the time of the hearing, that supported their\r\n  position that the North Carolina court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.Â \r\n  The Law Firmâ€™s judgment, which appears regular on its face, was entitled,\r\n  therefore, to full faith and credit.[22]\r\nI\r\n  would reverse.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] To the extent that Sec. Credit Leasing, Inc. v.\r\n  Armaly, 339 S.C. 533, 529 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 2000) is inconsistent with\r\n  this opinion, it is overruled.\r\n[2] Erickson argues that the forum selection clause in\r\n  the attorney/client agreement provides North Carolina with personal\r\n  jurisdiction. The circuit court found the agreement containing the clause was\r\n  not admissible because it was\r\n  a hearsay document and lacked a proper foundation.Â  Erickson does not appeal this ruling.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  have not considered the forum selection clause in reaching this\r\n  decision.\r\n[3]Â  Erickson requests that if we determine he is not\r\n  entitled to have his foreign judgment enforced, we enter our order without\r\n  prejudice so he can bring a â€œcommon law action for the enforcement of his\r\n  judgment.â€Â  Â Â We hold the issues of prejudice and the future application\r\n  of preclusion are not properly before this court for review.Â  \r\n[4] Â The cited code section is included within an article\r\n  entitled â€œthe Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  15-35-900 to -960 (2005).\r\n[5] Â The filing of a foreign judgment and affidavit\r\n  allows the foreign judgment to be docketed and indexed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-35-920(B) (2005).Â  Once a foreign judgment is filed pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-35-920(A), it â€œhas the same effect and is subject to the same\r\n  defenses as a judgment of this State and must be enforced or satisfied in like\r\n  manner.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-920(C) (2005); see 50 C.J.S. Judgment Â§ 985, at 593 (1997) (â€œ[A] foreign judgment rendered by a court of competent\r\n  jurisdiction may be registered in a court of the forum state for the purposes\r\n  of enforcement.â€).\r\n[6] Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940(A) (2005) provides in\r\n  relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    judgment debtor may file a motion for relief from . . . the foreign judgment .\r\n    . . on any ground for which relief from a judgment of this State is allowed.\r\n\r\n[7] Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940(B).Â  The cited section\r\n  reads:\r\n\r\n  If the judgment debtor has filed a motion for relief\r\n    or notice of defenses, then the judgment creditor may move for enforcement or\r\n    security of the foreign judgment as a judgment of this State, if all appeals of\r\n    the foreign judgment are finally concluded and the judgment is not further\r\n    contested.Â  The judgment creditorâ€™s motion must be heard before a judge who has\r\n    jurisdiction of the matter based upon the amount in controversy as the amount\r\n    remaining unpaid on the foreign judgment. Â The South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n    Procedure apply.Â  The judgment creditor has the burden of proving that the\r\n    foreign judgment is entitled to full faith and credit.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act does not affect a â€œjudgment\r\n  creditorâ€™s right to bring a civil action in this State to enforce the\r\n  creditorâ€™s judgment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-950 (2005).Â  See 50 C.J.S. Judgment Â§1042, at 650 (1997) (â€œCourts recognize at least two\r\n  proceedings for the enforcement of foreign judgments: filing under the Uniform\r\n  Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act . . . or filing a common law action.â€).\r\n[8] Â The trial judge recognized the Boykins as the moving\r\n  party at the hearing when he addressed the Boykinsâ€™ counsel. â€œGive me,â€ he\r\n  said, â€œa little factual history, moving party, what youâ€™re seeking, then Iâ€™ll\r\n  hear counsel tell me why he thinks you ought not to get that remedy.â€Â \r\n  Whereupon, as the record shows, counsel for the Boykins explained the\r\n  background of the case.Â  In doing so, counsel for the Boykins admitted her\r\n  clients â€œreceived a default judgment which [the Law Firm] has since registered\r\n  in Horry County and [the Boykins had] moved for relief from the enforcement of\r\n  the judgment based on the lack of personal jurisdiction.â€\r\n[9] Â The first sentence of the trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  recites that â€œTHIS MATTER COMES BEFORE THE COURT pursuant to a motion\r\n  filed by [the Boykins] seeking relief from the enforcement of a final\r\n  [j]udgment issued in the Buncombe County, North Carolina Superior Court on\r\n  August 19, 2003.Â  (Bolding in original)â€\r\n[10] Â See infra note 16.\r\n[11] Â See Gilmore v.

Stanton Cross, Jr., Master In Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4265\r\nHeard May 9, 2007 â€“ Filed June 27, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John Ravenel Chase, of Florence, and Sarah Patrick Spruill, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        David B. Miller and Mary Anna Neill, both of Myrtle Beach, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Shirley Osterneck appeals the master in equityâ€™s ruling that Myles\r\n  Osterneck is the owner of property formerly owned by his parents, David and\r\n  Gertrude Osterneck (Father and Mother).Â  Shirley disputes the masterâ€™s reliance\r\n  on a purported family agreement between Mother and her children, and the\r\n  allowance of testimony by Rhoda Osterneck, Father and Motherâ€™s\r\n  daughter-in-law.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather died testate on November 9, 1986,\r\n  survived by Mother and their three sons: Â Robert, Guy Kenneth, and Myles.Â  Fatherâ€™s\r\n  will named Myles and Robert as co-executors; however, Robert declined to serve.Â \r\n  Fatherâ€™s estate consisted of a one-half interest in the marital home, worth\r\n  approximately $225,000, and approximately $231,000 in other assets.Â  Father and\r\n  Mother also held a joint certificate of deposit with a right of survivorship.Â \r\n  The certificate of deposit was valued at $230,000.Â  Fatherâ€™s will left Mother\r\n  all personal property and the sons $500,000 to divide equally. Â There were\r\n  insufficient non-marital assets in the estate to fund the bequest to the sons.Â \r\n  Fatherâ€™s will did not specifically devise his one-half interest in the marital\r\n  home.Â  On June 11, 1987, Mother disclaimed her interest in the certificate of\r\n  deposit, allowing the money to pass to the estate.Â  \r\nFather and Motherâ€™s eldest son, Robert, died in 1991 and was\r\n  survived by his widow, Rhoda.Â  Father and Motherâ€™s middle son, Guy Kenneth,\r\n  passed away in 1993 and was survived by his widow, Shirley, the appellant.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  October 1993, Myles filed a petition to reopen Fatherâ€™s estate for the purpose\r\n  of conveying Fatherâ€™s one-half interest in the marital home to Mother.Â  In a letter dated December 1994, Shirley received\r\n  notice regarding the deed of distribution. \r\nIn October 1998, Myles purchased the marital home from Mother for\r\n  $635,000, $10,000 more than its appraised value.Â  In March 2001, Shirley\r\n  instituted litigation claiming an interest in the marital home.Â  She subsequently\r\n  filed an amended complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty and fraud by\r\n  Myles.Â  \r\nThe master found\r\n  that a family agreement existed to exchange Fatherâ€™s half interest in the\r\n  marital home for Motherâ€™s interest in the certificate of deposit, and that\r\n  title to the marital home belonged to Myles.Â  Further, the master held Myles\r\n  did not commit fraud or breach his fiduciary duty and that these claims were\r\n  barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe parties\r\n  disagree on the applicable standard of review.Â  A declaratory judgment action\r\n  is neither equitable nor legal, but is instead determined by the nature of the\r\n  underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400\r\n  S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  \r\nShirley argues the underlying action is to quiet\r\n  title, which she requested in her amended complaint.Â  An action to quiet title\r\n  resides in equity. Â Van Every v. Chinquapin Hollow, Inc., 265 S.C. 474,\r\n  477, 219 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1975).Â  When reviewing an equitable action heard first\r\n  by a master-in-equity and appealed directly to an appellate court, the court\r\n  should review the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  evidence in the record.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229,\r\n  237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990).Â  This broad scope of review does not require\r\n  the appellate court to ignore the fact that the master was in a better position\r\n  to assess the credibility of witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Id.\r\nMyles argues the\r\n  real issue is determining who has title to the marital home.Â  The determination\r\n  of who has title to real estate is a legal issue.Â  Cook&nbsp;v. Eller,\r\n  298 S.C. 395, 397, 380 S.E.2d 853, 854 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œIn a law case tried\r\n  by the judge without a jury the standard of appellate review is limited to a\r\n  correction of errors of law and a determination if there is any evidence to\r\n  support the factual findings of the trial judge.â€Â  Id. (citing Wigfall&nbsp;v.\r\n    Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 367 S.E.2d 156 (1988); Patterson v. I.H. Servs. Inc.,\r\n  295 S.C. 300, 368 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 1988)).\r\nIt is unnecessary\r\n  for us to determine which standard of review is applicable in this particular\r\n  case, as under either standard the result would be the same.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Family Agreement\r\nShirley argues the master\r\n  erred in finding the existence of a family agreement to exchange Fatherâ€™s\r\n  estateâ€™s half interest in the marital home for Motherâ€™s interest in a\r\n  certificate of deposit.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst,\r\n  we note the South Carolina Probate Code generally requires family agreements to\r\n  be in writing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-912 (1987).Â  However, the South Carolina\r\n  Probate Code does not apply to this case, because the probate code took effect\r\n  on July 1, 1987, after the agreement resulting in the swap of assets.[1] \r\nThe recognition\r\n  of family agreements is favored by the courts, and the evidence in this case\r\n  fully supports the making of such an agreement.Â  Smith&nbsp;v. Williams,\r\n  141 S.C. 265, 279, 139 S.E. 625, 629 (1927).Â  From a documentary perspective,\r\n  Fatherâ€™s estateâ€™s half interest in the marital home was initially listed in the\r\n  estateâ€™s probate papers.Â  Mother then signed a document disclaiming her\r\n  interest in a certificate of deposit worth $230,000, allowing this sum to pass\r\n  through the estate to the sons.Â  Subsequently, an accounting was submitted by\r\n  Myles, which listed the certificate of deposit but did not list the one-half\r\n  interest in the marital home.Â  Lastly, the deed of distribution was executed by\r\n  Myles on behalf of Fatherâ€™s estate, giving Mother the entire interest in the\r\n  marital home.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  testimony of several parties corroborated the evidence regarding the existence\r\n  of a family agreement.Â  Kenneth Davis, the accountant who prepared the tax\r\n  return for Fatherâ€™s estate, stated in a deposition:\r\n\r\n  So all\r\n    of us met - - Myles, Guy [Kenneth], Bob, and his mother.Â  All these Osternecks\r\n    and myself met in Guyâ€™s office.Â  And thatâ€™s when they told me that they had\r\n    decided that they had made a swap of the CD for the - - for the house in her\r\n    name.Â  So - - and for me to go ahead and make the tax return based on - - and -\r\n    - and whatever was best.Â  So thatâ€™s when I came up with the disclaimer.\r\n\r\nAt trial Myles\r\n  testified, â€œ[m]y brothers and myself agreed to exchange the half interest in my\r\n  father and motherâ€™s home so that my mother had full title to the house in\r\n  exchange for the $230,000.â€Â  In addition, the testimony of Rhoda, discussed in\r\n  more detail below, further corroborates the existence of the agreement. \r\nShirley correctly\r\n  notes that certain tax returns for Fatherâ€™s estate indicate that Mother and\r\n  Father jointly held title to the marital home as tenants by the entirety.[2]Â \r\n  She contends therefore that the family believed Mother already owned the\r\n  marital home outright, and she gave her disclaimer for no consideration.Â  If\r\n  so, there was no true exchange, and Fatherâ€™s half interest in the house should\r\n  remain in trust for the ultimate benefit of the sons or their heirs.Â  Despite\r\n  the tax returns, the greater weight of the evidence supports the existence of a\r\n  family agreement.Â  Consequently, the ruling of the master was appropriate.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Testimony Against\r\n  Interest\r\nShirley\r\n  further argues the master erred by admitting hearsay testimony from Rhoda\r\n  Osterneck regarding statements by Rhodaâ€™s deceased husband, Robert.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  admission of evidence is a matter left to the discretion of the trial judge\r\n  and, absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Carlyle v.\r\n    Tuomey Hosp.,&nbsp;305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633&nbsp;(1991)\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  â€œIn order for this court to reverse a case based on the\r\n  erroneous admission or erroneous exclusion of evidence the plaintiff must show\r\n  error and prejudice.â€Â  Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C.\r\n  378, 405, 175 S.E.2d 805, 819&nbsp;(1970).\r\nRules\r\n  804(a)(4) and 804(b)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provide\r\n  exceptions to the hearsay rule if the declarant, in this case Robert, is\r\n  unavailable due to death. Â The exception permits the admission of the statement\r\n  if it is so far contrary to the declarantâ€™s pecuniary interest that a\r\n  reasonable man in the same position would not have made the statement unless it\r\n  was true.Â  Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE. \r\nSection\r\n  19-11-20 of the South Carolina Code (1976), the â€œDead Manâ€™sâ€ statute, bars the\r\n  testimony of a person with an interest from testifying regarding a conversation\r\n  with a deceased individual.Â  However, the statute has many exceptions,\r\n  including â€œwitness testimony that is against his or her interest.â€Â  Brooks\r\n    v. Kay, 339 S.C. 479, 486, 530 S.E.2d 120, 124 (2000).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Rhoda agreed she was in the same legal position as Shirley because they\r\n  are both widows of a son of Father and Mother.Â  Rhoda testified her deceased\r\n  husband had told her that the sons and Mother met with the accountant and\r\n  decided Mother would disclaim her interest in the certificate of deposit in\r\n  exchange for Fatherâ€™s estateâ€™s one-half interest in the marital home.Â  \r\nRhodaâ€™s\r\n  testimony was against her personal interest, because she could make the same\r\n  claim Shirley was pursuing for an interest in the marital home.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Rhodaâ€™s husbandâ€™s statement was against his own interest because, if the family\r\n  agreement did not exist and Mother disclaimed her interest in the certificate\r\n  of deposit, the sons would have a windfall.Â  Therefore, the master did not\r\n  abuse his discretion in admitting Rhodaâ€™s testimony.Â  Even if the master erred\r\n  in admitting Rhodaâ€™s testimony, Shirley was not prejudiced due to the\r\n  overwhelming evidence that the family agreement existed.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Deed of\r\n  Distribution\r\nShirley\r\n  argues the deed of distribution does not convey Fatherâ€™s one-half interest in\r\n  the marital home to Mother.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  deed of distribution from a personal representative is evidence that the distributee has succeeded to the interest of the estate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-908 (Supp. 2006).Â  A personal representative\r\n  is also authorized to make a distribution in kind pursuant to section 62-3-907\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\nFatherâ€™s\r\n  will vested in Myles, as executor, the following powers:\r\n\r\n  (a)Â  To\r\n    sell, transfer and convey the whole or any part of the property, whether real\r\n    or personal, constituting this estate or trust, at such times, in such manner,\r\n    upon such terms and conditions, and for such price, as to the executor or\r\n    trustee shall seem best, together with power to make, execute and deliver such\r\n    instruments as shall be necessary to effectuate such sale or sales without an\r\n    order of court.\r\n\r\nMyles acted within\r\n  his power as executor by releasing the estateâ€™s claim on the marital home in\r\n  accordance with the family agreement through the deed of distribution.Â \r\n  Therefore, relying heavily on the masterâ€™s comprehensive opinion, we hold the\r\n  equities and legal conclusions reside with Myles.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the master did not err in holding Myles the sole owner of title to the marital\r\n  home because evidence established that a family agreement existed.Â  Further,\r\n  the master did not err in admitting Rhodaâ€™s testimony regarding statements made\r\n  by her deceased husband, and Myles acted within his powers as executor in\r\n  releasing Fatherâ€™s estateâ€™s claim on the marital home.Â  Therefore, the masterâ€™s\r\n  ruling is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Code Â§ 62-1-100 (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  Section 62-1-100(4) provides:\r\n\r\n  [A]n act done before the effective date in any proceeding and any\r\n    accrued right is not impaired by this Code.

Brown, Matthew K. Mahoney, and Jeffrey J. Wiseman, all\r\n          of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n        Joe Ann Matthews Calvy, of Kingstree, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  REA\r\n  Construction Co., Inc. and Zurich-American Insurance Co. (collectively â€œInsurerâ€)\r\n  appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order requiring them to provide Terry Pressley with a\r\n  wheelchair accessible mobile home and awarding Pressley compensation for ten\r\n  hours per day of non-professional home healthcare services.Â  We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 24, 2001, Pressley suffered a\r\n  compensable injury to his spinal cord while working for REA. The injury\r\n  rendered Pressley a paraplegic.Â  Â Insurer admitted Pressley suffered a\r\n  compensable injury and agreed Pressley was entitled to lifetime benefits.\r\n  Accordingly, Insurer has continuously provided appropriate medical care and\r\n  treatment to Pressley.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the time of the accident, Pressley\r\n  rented an apartment. After his injury, Pressley temporarily resided in various\r\n  rehabilitation facilities and hospitals. In September 2002, Pressley moved in\r\n  with his mother (Mother) where he has lived since. Initially, when Pressley\r\n  moved in with Mother, professional caregivers attended to his needs about eight\r\n  hours per day, five days a week. For reasons the record does not reveal,\r\n  professional care has since diminished to four hours per day.Â  Mother takes\r\n  care of him at all other times.Â  \r\nAt some point, to accommodate Pressleyâ€™s needs, Insurer made minor\r\n  modifications to Motherâ€™s house. However, the modifications only allowed\r\n  Pressley to access his bedroom; Pressley could not access any other room,\r\n  including the kitchen or the bathroom.Â  Motherâ€™s house could be modified to\r\n  become completely handicap accessible for a cost of approximately $68,400,[2] which, according to one estimate, is\r\n  almost as much as the cost of a new house upfitted for wheelchair\r\n  accessibility.Â Â  \r\nIn June\r\n  2002, Pressley filed a Form 50 with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission\r\n  seeking, in relevant part, increased medical care and wheelchair accessible\r\n  housing. After a hearing, the Single Commissioner held Pressley was entitled\r\n  to: (1) professional home healthcare for six hours a day, seven days a week;\r\n  (2) non-professional healthcare (from Mother or other non-professional) for ten\r\n  hours a day, seven days a week, at $7.00 per hour; and (3) wheelchair\r\n  accessible housing.Â  To determine the most appropriate method of providing\r\n  wheelchair accessible housing, the single commissioner instructed Insurer to\r\n  provide cost estimates for modifying Motherâ€™s house, providing a wheelchair\r\n  accessible apartment, purchasing wheelchair accessible housing with ownership\r\n  reverting to or retained by Insurer, and other appropriate options.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, an appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (hereafter\r\n  Commission) affirmed the Single Commissioner. However, the Commissionâ€™s order\r\n  included two â€œamendmentsâ€ to the Commissionerâ€™s order: â€œHousing: Carrier to\r\n  provide handicap accessible housing-mobile home or residential care facility.Â \r\n  If housing is mobile home, the ownership remains with carrier.Â  Finding of Fact\r\n  #7:Â  [Pressley] entitled to eight hours professional home health care seven\r\n  days a week; [Pressley] entitled to additional rehabilitation training.â€ The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s ruling â€œin regards to wheelchair accessible\r\n  housingâ€ and found Pressley was â€œentitled to eight hours of professional home\r\n  healthcare as ordered by the [Commission],â€ and further held Pressley was\r\n  â€œentitled to ten hours of non-professional care as ordered by the single\r\n  commissioner.â€Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of a\r\n  decision of an administrative agency.â€Â  Clark v. Aiken County Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102, 107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(5) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) establishes the substantial evidence rule\r\n  as the standard of review.Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse\r\n  or modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or\r\n  modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  See Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d) and (e).Â  \r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission\r\n  in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports the\r\n  findings.â€Â  Peoples v. Henry Co., 364 S.C. 123, 127, 611 S.E.2d 527, 528-29 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œâ€˜Substantial\r\n  evidenceâ€™ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly\r\n  from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a\r\n  whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the\r\n  administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its\r\n  action.â€Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n  (1981) (citation omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  primary rule of statutory construction is that the courts must ascertain the\r\n  intention of the legislature. Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002). The interpretation of a statute involves a question of\r\n  law for the court. Charleston County Parks &amp; Rec. Commâ€™n\r\n    v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995). Thus, this court is\r\n  free to decide matters of law with no particular deference to the trial court. Â Moriarty\r\n    v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675\r\n  (2000). Nevertheless, ordinarily, the construction of a statute by an agency\r\n  charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful deference\r\n  and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons. Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410,414 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase of Wheelchair\r\n  Accessible Mobile Home\r\nInsurer\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s order requiring\r\n  Insurer to purchase Pressley a wheelchair-accessible mobile home.[3]Â \r\n  Specifically, Insurer contends the Commission does not have the statutory\r\n  authority under Â§ 42-15-60 of the South Carolina Code (1985) to require an\r\n  Insurer to cover the total purchase price of a wheelchair accessible mobile\r\n  home. Insurer contends the statute only gives the Commission authority to\r\n  require the payment of necessary costs to make housing provided by claimant\r\n  handicap accessible, i.e. the difference between a comparable new mobile home\r\n  and a new modified mobile home.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSection\r\n  42-15-60 governs the Commissionâ€™s award of reasonably necessary medical costs.Â \r\n  Section 42-15-60 provides, in pertinent part: â€œIn cases in which total and\r\n  permanent disability results, reasonable and necessary nursing services,\r\n  medicines, prosthetic devices, sick travel, medical, hospital and other\r\n    treatment or care shall be paid during the life of the injured employee,\r\n  without regard to any limitation in this title including the\r\n  maximum compensation limit.â€Â  (emphasis added). Thus, this appeal presents the novel issue of whether the Commission has\r\n  the statutory authority to require an insurer to provide the base cost of\r\n  furnishing an employee handicap accessible housing. Both parties rely on Strickland v.\r\n    Bowater, Inc., 322 S.C. 471,\r\n  472 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 1996) as furnishing the answer to this question.\r\nIn Strickland,\r\n  this court analyzed whether Â§ 42-15-60, in particular the provision allowing\r\n  for â€œother treatment or care,â€ authorizes the Commission to require an Insurer\r\n  to pay the full cost of a van modified to accommodate the handicapped\r\n  claimant.Â  In Strickland, the employer agreed to pay the costs associated with modifying the van and\r\n  acquiesced to the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  order to pay the cost difference between an unmodified van and a mid-range\r\n  automobile of the same year.Â  On appeal, the employee argued the Insurer should\r\n  also be required to pay the â€œbase costâ€ of the modified van.Â  We held: â€œWhile the provisions of the workersâ€™ compensation law are\r\n  entitled to a liberal construction in favor of the employee, we do not believe\r\n  that under our present statute an employer could be required to pay for [the\r\n  base costs of the unmodified van].â€Â  Id. at 474, 472 S.E.2d at 637.Â  \r\nIn Thompson\r\n  v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369\r\n  S.C. 606, 632 S.E.2d 874 (Ct. App. 2006) (cert. pending), we examined whether\r\n  the Commission erred in denying an employeeâ€™s request for funds to upfit his\r\n  new home to accommodate his special needs.Â  In Thompson, the Commission\r\n  ordered employer to advance the employee a lump sum to purchase a new home;\r\n  however, the Commission did not require the employer to pay the costs for\r\n  modifying the employeeâ€™s new home.Â  Id. at 610-11, 632 S.E.2d at 877.Â  Both\r\n  parties appealed.Â  This court affirmed the partial-lump sum award[4] and held the employer must also pay to upfit the employeeâ€™s home\r\n  because â€œ[t]he modifications are necessitated solely by [employeeâ€™s] admittedly\r\n  compensable injury.â€Â  Id. at 619, 632 S.E.2d at 882.Â  Thus, the employer\r\n  was required to both advance sums to purchase the employeeâ€™s new home, and pay\r\n  the cost to modify it.Â  \r\nWhile Strickland and Thompson offer guidance as to the appropriate\r\n  interpretation of Â§42-15-60, neither case controls our analysis in the present\r\n  appeal.Â  In Strickland, the employer agreed to pay certain costs\r\n  directly connected to employeeâ€™s handicapped condition (the costs of\r\n  modification and increased price of van over average mid-size car).Â  As such, Strickland only stands for the proposition that\r\n  the Commission has authority to require an employer to pay for that portion of\r\n  the base cost an employeeâ€™s unmodified van that exceeds the price of an average\r\n  mid-sized car.Â  Similarly, in Thompson,\r\n  the employer only argued the partial-lump sum advance for the new house, i.e.\r\n  the â€œbase cost,â€ violated section 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2005); the employer did not contend the Commission lacked the authority to make\r\n  such an award.Â  Id. at 614-15, 632 S.E.2d at 879.Â  Accordingly, Thompson fails to articulate whether Â§ 42-15-60 allows the Commission to require the\r\n  employer to pay the â€œbase costâ€ of the employeeâ€™s new home.Â  \r\nInasmuch\r\n  as our Workerâ€™s Compensation Act is modeled after the North Carolina Act, we\r\n  naturally look to North Carolinaâ€™sÂ  decisions in interpreting similar\r\n  provisions. As stated in Strickland, the North Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  held in Derebery v. Pitt County Fire Marshall, 318 N.C. 192, 347 S.E.2d\r\n  814 (1986) that â€œother treatment or careâ€ as contained in its statute required\r\n  an employer to provide an employee with wheelchair-accessible housing. However,\r\n  we note that in the subsequent North Carolina Court of Appeals case ofÂ  Timmons\r\n    v. N. C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 123 N.C. App. 456, 462-63, 473 S.E. 2d 356, 360\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996), that court found that the employer did not have to absorb the\r\n  entire cost of constructing the claimantâ€™s new residence.Â  The court reasoned:Â  \r\n\r\n  We\r\n    do not agree with [claimant], however that Derebery requires [employer]\r\n    to pay the entire cost of constructing his residence. As pointed out by Justice\r\n    (later Chief Justice) Billings in her dissent in Derebery, the expense\r\n    of housing is an ordinary necessity of life, to be paid from the statutory\r\n    substitute for wages provided by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. The costs of\r\n    modifying such housing, however, to accommodate one with extraordinary needs\r\n    occasioned by a workplace injury, such as the [claimant] in this case, is not\r\n    an ordinary expense of life for which the statutory substitute wage is intended\r\n    as compensation. \r\n\r\nId. at 461-62, 473 S.E.2d at 359 (affirmed by Timmons v. N.C. Depâ€™t\r\n  of Transp., 346 N.C. 173, 484 S.E.2d 551 (1997)).\r\nWe are in\r\n  agreement with what appears to be the law of North Carolina that the base cost\r\n  of providing an injured employee housing is an ordinary necessity of life which\r\n  the statutory substitute for wages should be utilized by the employee to\r\n  obtain.Â  We, therefore, reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order to the extent it\r\n  holds that section 42-15-60 permits the Commission to order an employer to pay\r\n  the base cost of handicap accessible housing.\r\nAt\r\n  oral argument, it developed that although the employer is willing to provide\r\n  care for Pressley in a residential care facility, Pressley has refused the same.Â \r\n  On the other hand, although Pressley appealed to the circuit court the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s failure to â€œenter specific findings as to its basis/rationale for\r\n  determining that [employer] is only required to provide [him] handicap\r\n  accessible housing-mobile home or residential care facility,â€ he has not\r\n  appealed the failure of the trial court to address that issue.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  Commission adopted â€œin totoâ€ the findings of fact of the Single Commissioner\r\n  which required Insurer to provide a factual basis to enable it to determine\r\n  what type of handicap accessible housing would be appropriate for Pressley.Â  This\r\n  has never been done, and the Commission did not have this information before it\r\n  when it made its decision.Â  The posture of the case is further complicated by\r\n  the failure of the Commission and trial court to specify whether Insurer or\r\n  Pressley has the option to choose which of the two types of housing enumerated\r\n  in the Commissionâ€™s order the Insurer must provide.\r\nUnder\r\n  the unique facts of this case, it appears that under both \r\n      Strickland and Thompson, the Commission could have ordered the\r\n  Insurer to absorb the cost to modify Pressleyâ€™s motherâ€™s house. Moreover, the\r\n  record indicates that the cost to modify the motherâ€™s house totals between\r\n  $68,400[5] and $70,000.[6]Â  According to the trial court, the apparent reason for the Commission\r\n  not ordering that option was its economic infeasibility.Â  Under the confused\r\n  posture of this case, justice demands we remand to the Commission to determine\r\n  what wheelchair accessible housing is appropriate in light of our decision that\r\n  the statute does not permit the Commission to require the employer to pay the\r\n  base cost of a wheelchair accessible mobile home.Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;Non-Professional Care\r\nInsurer\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding Pressley was entitled to receive ten\r\n  hours per day of non-professional home healthcare.Â  We agree.\r\nSection\r\n  42-15-60 also controls our analysis of this issue.Â  Pursuant to section\r\n  42-15-60, an injured employee is entitled to receive â€œreasonable and necessary\r\n  nursing services.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  Single Commissioner, under findings of fact #7 held:\r\n\r\n  [Pressley] is entitled to\r\n    professional home health care for 6 hours a day, 7 days a week.Â  [Pressley]â€™s mother or other non-professional should be paid $7.00\r\n    an hour for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week.Â  This is a total of 16 hours of\r\n    health care [sic] and/or assistance per day.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Commissionâ€™s order also contained an amendment which read: â€œFinding of Fact #7:Â  [Pressley] entitled\r\n  to eight hours professional home health careÂ  seven days a week; [Pressley]\r\n  entitled to additional rehabilitation training.â€Â  The circuit court held\r\n  Pressley was entitled to eight hours professional home healthcare as ordered by\r\n  the Commission and ten hours non-professional care as ordered by the Single Commissioner.Â \r\n  The circuit court also remanded the case to the Commission to determine the\r\n  appropriate compensation rate for non-professional healthcare providers.Â Â  \r\nInsurer contends the Commissionâ€™s order implicitly\r\n  reversed the Single Commissionerâ€™s order in regards to non-professional care. Â We\r\n  agree.Â  The Commissionâ€™s order amends finding of fact # 7 to award 8 hours of\r\n  professional care and eliminates any requirement to pay for non-professional\r\n  care.Â  Pressley appealed the Commissionâ€™s failure to provide for non-professional\r\n  care to the circuit court, which awarded 10 hours of non-professional care\r\n  daily. \r\nBefore\r\n  the Single Commissioner, Pressley testified he needs assistance throughout most\r\n  of the day and, at times, when he wakes in the middle of the night. Â Pressley\r\n  also testified he believes he needs help twenty-four hours a day.Â  Further, a\r\n  doctorâ€™s evaluation provides that while Pressley is able to perform some\r\n  self-care functions he â€œwill always need a caregiver to assist him with all the\r\n  activities of daily living.â€ On the other hand, Dr. Adora Matthews of Palmetto\r\n  Rehabilitation Medicine stated that â€œPressley will benefit from some care in\r\n  the home, probably up to 8 hours per day.â€ \r\nAlthough\r\n  there is evidence that some non-professional care is needed, there is no basis\r\n  for the finding of the circuit court awarding 10 hours of non-professional\r\n  care.[7]Â \r\n  After a thorough review of the record, we hold substantial evidence supports\r\n  the finding of the Commission regarding the professional care needed by\r\n  Pressley, but not a finding that Pressley does not need any non-professional\r\n  home care.Â  Moreover, while the circuit court could have found the evidence\r\n  mandated remand to the Commission for a determination of the appropriate hours\r\n  of non- professional care, the court was not free to establish the hours at ten\r\n  hours per day.Â  We therefore remand to the Commission the issues of the\r\n  appropriate number of non-professional hours of care Pressley is entitled to\r\n  and the establishment of the rate to be paid for that care. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the circuit court erred in concluding the Insurer was required to provide\r\n  Pressley with a handicap accessible mobile home.Â  Additionally, the court erred\r\n  in ordering employer to pay for ten hours per day of non-professional care.Â  We\r\n  therefore remand this case to the Commission to determine the appropriate\r\n  handicap accessible housing for Pressley, the appropriate number of hours of\r\n  non-professional care he may be entitled to receive, and the rate at which the\r\n  care is to be paid.Â  On both issues, the Commission shall with specificity set\r\n  forth the basis for its decision in accordance with Shealy v. Aiken County,\r\n  341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000) and Baldwin v. James River Corp.,\r\n  304 S.C. 485, 405 S.E.2d 421 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Accordingly, the order of the\r\n  circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.Â Â Â  \r\nBEATTY\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Pressley testified it would cost $70,000 to upfit his\r\n  motherâ€™s home, while a contractor submitted an estimate for $68,400 to make the\r\n  home wheelchair accessible.\r\n[3] We note the Commissionâ€™s order appears to provide\r\n  that the purchase of the mobile home is one option Insurer may undertake and\r\n  does not specifically require Insurer to purchase the mobile home. Â Â Â Â \r\n[4] This lump-sum was to be deducted from the employeeâ€™s\r\n  life time benefits.\r\n[5] As stated by a builder.\r\n[6] As testified to by Pressley.\r\n[7] In this regard, the Commission, not the circuit court\r\n  is the fact finder as to how much non-professional care Pressley is entitled\r\n  to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4267","title":"State v.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Â Terry Bernard Davis (â€œDavisâ€) appeals his conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Â  Davis argues that the trial judge erred in declining to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n Davis, along with his cousin Robert Britton, lived in the home of his brother, Christopher Davis (â€œChristopherâ€).Â  Davis, a crack cocaine user, allowed Kevin Harrison and Shontae Broaddus to sell crack cocaine out of Christopherâ€™s home in exchange for some of their crack cocaine.[2]Â  Davis also acted as a sort of middleman for Harrison and Broaddus, bringing customers to the dealers in exchange for a portion of the crack cocaine being sold.Â  Davis allowed Bridgette Martin, a fellow crack cocaine user, to live in the home. [3] \r\n\r\nBefore leaving for work on the morning of October 1, 2003, Christopher told Davis that Harrison and Broaddus could no longer stay in the house and that Davis would have to ask them to leave.Â  Broaddus overheard Christopherâ€™s request and, realizing he was no longer welcome, decided to leave.Â  Broaddus commented to Harrison that he should leave too; however, Harrison ignored him and returned to a recliner he had been sleeping in earlier.\r\nDavis, in a statement to the police, claimed he asked Harrison to leave the residence.Â  By this time, Christopher, Broaddus, and Britton had already left the house.Â  Harrison supposedly pulled out his handgun, put it to Davisâ€™s head, and told Davis to leave him alone.Â  Harrison reportedly said he had given Davis enough crack cocaine to entitle him to remain in the home until 10 a.m.Â  Davis returned shortly thereafter with Brittonâ€™s five-pound sledgehammer, wrapped a towel around the head of it, and hit Harrison twice in the head with it.Â  Harrison was seated in the recliner when Davis struck him with the sledgehammer.Â  The first blow supposedly stunned Harrison, but Davis claimed he needed to hit Harrison again to prevent Harrison from using his gun.Â  Davis then enlisted Martinâ€™s help, the only other person in the house at that time, and the two of them dragged Harrisonâ€™s body outside.Â  Davis repeated this version of events to Christopher and Britton, although in Brittonâ€™s version Davis claimed he only intended to knock Harrison out and remove him from the home.\r\nMartin testified she did not hear Davis and Harrison argue that day.Â  Before Harrison was killed, Davis told her, â€œIâ€™m gone [sic] kill that b***h.â€Â  Martin initially ignored the statement, but Davis returned later and said, while dragging Harrisonâ€™s body past the bedroom door, that he â€œkill[ed] that b***h.â€Â  Davis was holding a sledgehammer with the hammer part wrapped in a towel as he dragged Harrisonâ€™s body.Â  Martin testified Davis had threatened other dealers in the past, often with a variation of the phrase â€œ[I will] [k]ill you and smoke your s**t like a chimneyâ€; however, the threats were never taken seriously.Â  Martin admitted she smoked crack cocaine and consumed alcohol on the morning that Harrison was killed.\r\n Davis traded Harrisonâ€™s gun and cell phone for $40 in crack cocaine.Â  Martin also claims that Davis took Harrisonâ€™s supply of crack cocaine and offered to share with her.Â  A neighbor discovered Harrisonâ€™s body, wrapped in a carpet, situated between his yard and Christopher Davisâ€™s property.\r\nAn autopsy of Harrison revealed an injury to his skull, caused by a significant blow to the side of Harrisonâ€™s head, which produced a fracture at the base of Harrisonâ€™s skull from ear to ear.Â  The forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Janice Ross, opined that Harrisonâ€™s injury was consistent with one or two blows from a sledgehammer that he received while seated.Â  Her examination of Harrison did not reveal any defensive wounds.[4]\r\n Davis was indicted for murder.Â  Davisâ€™s counsel requested jury instructions on involuntary manslaughter and self-defense.Â  The State objected to the involuntary manslaughter charge and the trial court declined to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  The jury found Davis guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and the trial court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.â€[5]Â  â€œTo warrant reversal, a trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.â€[6]Â  â€œDue process requires that a lesser included offense be charged when the evidence warrants it but only if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense.â€[7]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDavis argues the trial judge erred by declining to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is defined as â€œthe killing of another without malice and unintentionally while engaged in either: (1) an unlawful act not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) a lawful act with reckless disregard for the safety of others.â€[8]Â  â€œTo constitute involuntary manslaughter, there must be a finding of criminal negligence, statutorily defined as a reckless disregard of the safety of others.â€[9]\r\nDavis relies on State v. Chatman for the proposition that an intentional act causing death does not necessarily preclude involuntary manslaughter.[10]Â  We believe Chatman is distinguishable from the case at hand.Â  Chatman was engaged in an assault and battery with the victim, during which Chatman, while facing the victim, pressed his shoulder into the victimâ€™s neck.[11] Â Although Chatman released the victim shortly thereafter, the victim â€œdied as a result of asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.â€[12]Â  Chatmanâ€™s actions did not fit the typical strangulation type situation because he did not place his hands around the victimâ€™s neck.[13]Â  As a result, the court concluded Chatman was entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter because his actions were not the kind that would naturally tend to cause serious bodily injury or death.[14]Â  We think the facts in this case do not fit the first definition of involuntary manslaughter, as the court used in deciding Chatman, because striking someone on the side of the head with a five-pound sledgehammer would naturally tend to cause death or great bodily injury.[15]\r\nDavis also argues the facts of this case fit the second definition of involuntary manslaughter.Â  He contends he acted lawfully by arming himself in self-defense to drive out an armed trespasser.Â  Davis fails to meet the second definition of involuntary manslaughter because there is no evidence he handled the sledgehammer with reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  The evidence firmly establishes that Davis intentionally struck Harrison on the head with the sledgehammer. [16] \r\nBased on the above, we hold the trial court did not commit error in denying Davisâ€™s request for a jury charge on involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Harrison is also referred to by his alias â€œLittle Kâ€ throughout the record.\r\n[3]Â  Martin testified she only stayed at the home during the daytime.\r\n[4]Â  Dr. Ross testified that defensive wounds are wounds incurred by the victim while trying to defend from an attacker.Â  These injuries are usually in the form of bruises or lacerations on the outside of the arms or hands.\r\n[5]Â  State v.

Brown, of Fountain Inn, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tPhillip E. Reeves, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Annabelle Shelton appeals the trial courtâ€™s granting of summary judgment to LS&amp;K, Inc., and its denial of Sheltonâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises out of an accident that occurred on May 7, 2004 in front of a Burger King franchise owned and operated by respondent LS&amp;K.Â  The accident occurred when Jo Ann Suttles was exiting the parking lot to turn onto North Main Street in Fountain Inn, South Carolina.Â  The driveway exit crossed a pedestrian sidewalk to reach the street.\r\nImmediately prior to the accident, Suttles approached the parking lot exit and stopped her vehicle to wait for traffic to pass before making a right turn.Â  Unbeknownst to Suttles, Annabelle Shelton was walking along the sidewalk to the right of Suttlesâ€™ car.Â  When the traffic cleared, Suttles started her right-turn and struck Shelton as she crossed the driveway on the sidewalk.Â \r\n \r\nShelton sustained a head injury and has no recollection of how the accident occurred.Â  Officer R. E. Inman saw the accident as Shelton was struck by the car, but did not see any of the preceding events.Â  There were no other witnesses.\r\nThe dispute in this case centers on a Bradford Pear tree which was located to Suttlesâ€™ right as she exited the parking lot onto North Main.Â  Suttles testified that she frequently visited the Burger King and was familiar with the parking lot and the location of the pear tree.Â  Shelton maintains that the tree obscured Suttlesâ€™ view of Shelton walking on the sidewalk. Â Shelton alleged that LS&amp;K was negligent in failing to maintain its premises so that drivers exiting the parking lot had a clear view of pedestrians on the sidewalk.\r\nShelton filed her amended complaint in September of 2004, alleging that LS&amp;K was negligent in the design of its landscaping and parking lot and causing and/or contributing to the accident.Â  After discovery, LS&amp;K moved for summary judgment, arguing no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the elements of negligence.Â  The trial court granted its motion, finding Shelton did not provide evidence that LS&amp;K breached any duty of care owed to her, and that she did not provide evidence of proximate cause.Â  The trial court concluded Shelton failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence against LS&amp;K, because she offered no expert testimony to establish the appropriate standard of care.Â  This appeal followed. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellate courts review a grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  â€œSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.Â Â  When reviewing the record, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id. 361-62.Â  The existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving partyâ€™s position is not sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment.Â  Bravis v. Dunbar, 316 S.C. 263, 265, 449 S.E.2d 495, 496 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 341, 499 S.E.2d 488, 493 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  With respect to an issue upon which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof, this initial responsibility may be discharged by showing the trial court there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partyâ€™s case.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Breached Duty of Care\r\nShelton first argues the court misapprehended her negligence claim as an allegation of negligent design, and therefore improperly ruled against her based upon lack of expert testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court held there was no evidence to establish that LS&amp;K breached any duty of care owed to the plaintiff because it found that negligence in the design and construction, as a matter of professional negligence, requires qualified expert testimony to establish both the standard of care for design and construction of the parking lot, and LS&amp;Kâ€™s deviation therefrom.Â  Notably, Shelton conceded before the circuit court that the design of a parking lot is a matter not within the expertise of a layperson.Â  Thus, because Â Sheltonâ€™s only expert had no opinion relating to the design of the parking lot or any other standard of care, the court concluded that Shelton presented no evidence of a breached duty of care.\r\nOn appeal, Shelton argues that it was never her position that the parking lot was designed improperly.Â  However, Sheltonâ€™s complaint and arguments at trial are at odds with this contention.Â  Sheltonâ€™s amended complaint alleges that LS&amp;K was negligent in â€œ[p]lacing inappropriate trees, shrubbery and landscaping around the driveway,â€ and in â€œ[f]ailing to appropriately delineate where the sidewalk was with any sort of lineage.â€Â  Also, at the summary judgment hearing, Shelton argued to the trial court: â€œThey designed the lot.Â  They designed where the exit was.Â  They designed where the tree was planted and they planted it.â€Â  We find that these allegations and arguments did indeed contemplate a claim of negligence in the design. Â â€œIt is well settled that one cannot present and try [her] case on one theory and then change [her] theory on appeal.â€Â  Gurganious v. City of Beaufort, 317 S.C. 481, 488, 454 S.E.2d 912, 916 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, even if this was not a design defect case, we would affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment. Â In deciding whether a defendant acted negligently, â€œ[t]he court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a particular duty.Â  If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Underwood v. Coponen, 367 S.C. 214, 217, 625 S.E.2d 236, 238 (Ct. App. 2006). Â Here, Shelton failed to supply any evidence, expert or otherwise, regarding the proper placement and maintenance of trees in a commercial parking lot.Â  Thus, based on the evidence presented, the visual obstruction caused by the tree was no different than an obstruction caused by a building or anything else encountered in daily life.Â  We find that without any basis on which a jury might differentiate between those visual obstructions which are permissible and those which are not, a jury would have to engage in pure conjecture and speculation in deciding how LS&amp;K should have designed or maintained its parking lot. [1]\r\nUnderwood v. Coponen is factually a very similar case.Â  In Underwood, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of a defendant landowner whose tree obstructed a stop sign, thereby causing a motorist to be involved in a collision.Â  367 S.C. 214, 625 S.E.2d 236 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The court of appeals affirmed summary judgment because Underwood failed to establish a legal duty on the part of the landowner to prevent his tree from causing such obstruction.Â  Likewise, Shelton does not establish a legal duty on the part of LS&amp;K to prevent the obstruction caused by the Bradford pear tree in this case.\r\nFurther, Sheltonâ€™s own expert testified that Suttles had an unobstructed view twenty-five feet down the sidewalk to her right before she struck Shelton and that Shelton had an unobstructed view of the front of Suttlesâ€™ vehicle from forty-five feet away.Â  Shelton provided no evidence of how far a pedestrian and a driver should have been afforded unobstructed views at the parking lot exit, and she provided no evidence that these views were insufficient. Â See Williams v. Lancaster County School Dist., 369 S.C. 293, 307, 631 S.E.2d 286, 294 (Ct. App. 2006) (summary judgment upheld because of claimantâ€™s â€œinability to establish evidence to support the elements required under the claimâ€). \r\n \r\nFinally, landowners generally do not owe a duty to warn others of an open and obvious condition on the property.Â  See Denton v. Winn Dixie Greenville, Inc., 312 S.C. 119, 121, 439 S.E.2d 292, 294 (Ct. App. 1993) (affirming summary judgment in a negligence action where customer tripped over a shopping cart corral in a parking lot, reasoning corrals are common structures that a person taking reasonable care for her own safety would likely expect and see while on the premises).Â  Absent any evidence that LS&amp;K created an unreasonably dangerous condition, there is no genuine issue of material fact and summary judgment is appropriate.Â  Garvin v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 343 S.C. 625, 629, 541 S.E.2d 831, 833 (2001).Â Â  Because Shelton has failed to provide any evidence to establish how the presence of the tree was unreasonable, she failed to meet her burden of proof.Â  Therefore, we find no error by the trial court in granting summary judgment.\r\nII.&nbsp; Proximate Cause\r\nSecond, Shelton argues that the court improperly ruled against her based on lack of evidence of proximate cause.Â  Because we affirm summary judgment based on the duty of care and breach elements, we do not reach Sheltonâ€™s second argument. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the undisputed facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to Shelton, we find that Shelton failed to present evidence of a duty on the part of LS&amp;K, or that such a duty was breached. Based on the foregoing, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] South Carolina does recognize a duty of reasonable care on the part of urban landowners to inspect trees on their property and make sure they are safe.Â  Underwood v. Coponen, 367 S.C. 214, 217, 625 S.E.2d 236, 238 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  But this duty extends only to ensuring that a tree is not â€œunsound or defective.â€Â  Israel v. Carolina Bar-B-Que, 292 S.C. 282, 288-90, 356 S.E.2d 123, 127-28 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding an urban landowner liable for damage caused by a fallen limb because there was evidence that the owner saw or could have seen upon reasonable inspection that the tree was partially decayed).Â  Because the only alleged defect of the tree was that it obscured Suttlesâ€™ vision at some point before she reached the sidewalk, the Israel rule does not apply to these facts.Â  Underwood v. Coponen, 367 S.C. 214, 218, 625 S.E.2d 236, 238 (Ct.

Brittingham and James T. Hedgepath, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tG. Conrad Derrick, of Florence, Â for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  The State Budget and Control Board Employee Insurance Program (the Insurance Program) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s award of long term disability benefits to Linda McPhail Wilson.Â Â  The Insurance Program argues the circuit court exceeded its scope of review when it reversed the Long Term Disability Appeals Committeeâ€™s denial of Wilsonâ€™s claim.Â  We agree and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilson, a â€œjob developerâ€ for the Darlington County Disabilities and Special Needs Board, applied for long term disability benefits after she was involved in an automobile accident on April 28, 2001.Â  She sought disability benefits due to an alleged injury to her lower back and knee.\r\nInitially, Wilsonâ€™s claim was reviewed by Standard Insurance Company (Standard), the third-party claims administrator for her long term disability plan.Â  Standard denied the claim, and Wilson requested a review of the denial.Â  For the review, Wilson submitted additional medical records, but again, Standard denied her claim. Â After receiving this second denial, Wilson sought an independent review from Standardâ€™s Quality Assurance Unit, which also denied Wilsonâ€™s claim. After this denial, Wilson pursued an appeal to the Employee Insurance Programâ€™s Long Term Disability Appeals Committee (Appeals Committee).Â  This three-member committee conducted a de novo review of Wilsonâ€™s Long Term Disability Insurance Plan (the Insurance Plan) and Wilsonâ€™s medical records.Â  \r\n \r\nAccording to the Insurance Plan, employees are considered disabled if an injury renders them unable to perform â€œwith reasonable continuity the Material Duties of [their] Own Occupation.â€Â  The Insurance Plan further explains:\r\n\r\n\tOwn Occupation means any employment, business, trade, profession, calling or vocation that involves Material Duties of the same general character as your regular and ordinary employment with the Employer.Â  Your Own Occupation is not limited to your job with your Employer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the generic description of a â€œJob Developer,â€ the position involves standing, walking, sitting, lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, climbing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling, and reaching, among other less strenuous activities.Â  However, Wilsonâ€™s supervisor, Christopher Woods, stated that Wilsonâ€™s job merely required frequent driving, walking, and standing with no lifting.Â  Furthermore, Karol Paquette, Wilsonâ€™s vocational case manager, reported that the physical requirements of Wilsonâ€™s job did not require crawling, kneeling, crouching, or climbing.Â  Paquette opined that Wilsonâ€™s job might fall in the â€œsedentary to light range of strength.â€Â  \r\n \r\nIn addition to this evidence regarding Wilsonâ€™s â€œOwn Occupation,â€ the Appeals Committee also reviewed a long transcript of medical records from five different physicians: Dr. Hyler, Wilsonâ€™s family doctor; Dr. Faulstich, Wilsonâ€™s radiologist; Dr. Healy, a neurologist; Dr. Beeson, a board-certified internist; and Dr. DeMichele, a neurologist.\r\nDr. Hyler noted that Wilson experienced â€œspasms and pain in [her] lower back,â€ and he recommended she stop working after the accident. Â He referred Wilson to a neurologist.Â  As of July 5, 2001, Dr. Hyler opined she could likely return to work in three months.Â \r\n \r\nOn June 6, 2001, Dr. Faulstich performed an MRI of Wilsonâ€™s spine and found no abnormalities.Â  The record before the Appeals Committee also contained an X-Ray of Wilsonâ€™s spine taken the day of her accident.Â  This X-Ray did not reveal any abnormalities either.\r\n \r\nDr. Healy, the neurologist to whom Dr. Hyler referred Wilson, also reviewed the June 6, 2001 MRI and found it â€œunremarkable.â€Â  He suggested Wilson pursue physical therapy to alleviate her pain.Â \r\n \r\nDr. Beeson reviewed Wilsonâ€™s medical records at the behest of Standard, the third-party insurer.Â  In August of 2002, he found that based on the information from Wilsonâ€™s treating physicians, Wilson could â€œcontinue to work in a sedentary or light occupation such as that of a job development specialist.â€Â  \r\n \r\nIn October of 2002, Wilson consulted Dr. DeMichele, who ordered a bone scan of Wilsonâ€™s entire body.Â  The bone scan showed signs of arthritis in Wilsonâ€™s back.Â  Dr. DeMichele also had Wilson participate in a lower body nerve conduction study.Â  The results showed evidence of nerve damage in Wilsonâ€™s left leg.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter visiting with Dr. DeMichele, Wilson submitted the results of her bone scan and nerve conduction study to Dr. Beeson.Â  Even in light of this additional information, Dr. Beeson was of the opinion that Wilson could perform a light work occupation.Â \r\n \r\nBefore the Appeals Committee made its determination, Wilson submitted a February 18, 2003 note from Dr. DeMichele, which stated Wilson was â€œtotally and permanently disabled.â€Â  Wilson also submitted notes from her March 19, 2003 visit with Dr. DeMichele, which stated, â€œIf they could read, they would see a nerve conduction study . . . which shows diffuse polyneuropathy in [Wilsonâ€™s] lower extremity.â€Â  The notes also opined that Wilson had osteoarthritis and other problems in her lower back.Â \r\n \r\nWith these facts before it, the Appeals Committee unanimously denied Wilsonâ€™s claim, finding â€œinsufficient medical documentation to support limitations or restrictions that continued through the end of the [Planâ€™s 90-day Benefit Waiting Period].â€Â  The Appeals Committee also found Wilsonâ€™s occupation involved â€œsedentary-light workâ€ and that she was capable of performing the duties required of her.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter receiving this decision from the Appeals Committee, Wilson submitted documentation establishing that she had been approved to receive Social Security Disability.Â  The Appeals Committee reconsidered the case in light of the finding of disability by the Social Security Administration, but reaffirmed its denial of Wilsonâ€™s claim.Â  The Appeals Committee noted that it was bound by the Long Term Disability Income Benefit Plan, and the information provided regarding Social Security benefits did not alter the Committeeâ€™s original decision that Wilson did not meet the Planâ€™s definition of disabled.Â  \r\n \r\nWilson appealed this decision to the circuit court.Â  After hearing oral argument from counsel, the circuit court suggested an independent medical examination be conducted by Dr. Donald Johnson, a surgeon at the Southeastern Spine Institute.Â  Both parties consented, and Dr. Johnson examined Wilson and her medical records.Â  Based on his examination, Dr. Johnson opined:Â  â€œBased on the medical records, particularly the objective information that I have seen, I would expect that this patient should be able to return to sedentary/light work.â€Â  \r\n \r\nDespite Dr. Johnsonâ€™s independent medical examination, the circuit court found the decision of the Appeals Committee was arbitrary, capricious, and clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence in the record.Â  Specifically, the circuit court found the Appeals Committee erred in relying on the opinion of Dr. Beeson, a non-treating internist, rather than on the opinions of her treating physicians, particularly that of Dr. Hyler and Dr. DeMichele.Â  Pursuant to its holding, the circuit court awarded Wilson $36,800 in retroactive benefits and continuing benefits as allowed under the Long Term Disability policy.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nPursuant to section 1-23-380(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005), when the circuit court reviews the final decision of an agency, â€œ[t]he court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€Â  Rather, the decision of the agency should be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence in the record, is arbitrary or capricious, or is affected by other error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(6) (2005).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Insurance Program argues the circuit court erred in finding the denial of benefits to Wilson was not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough Wilson presented evidence to the Appeals Committee supporting her disability claim, the Committee also had before it substantial evidence to the contrary.Â  The X-Ray of Wilsonâ€™s spine taken immediately after the accident showed no abnormalities, and both Dr. Faulstich and Dr. Healy found no abnormalities in the MRI performed on Wilsonâ€™s lumbar spine in June of 2001.Â  Based on a review of Wilsonâ€™s medical records, Dr. Beeson unequivocally found Wilson was not disabled.Â  Furthermore, substantial evidence in the record supported the finding that Wilsonâ€™s job required light to sedentary work.Â  Thus, even though the bone scan showed that Wilson suffered from osteoarthritis, substantial evidence did not demonstrate why such a condition would prevent her from performing light duties.Â  Notably, both parties consented to allowing Dr. Johnson to perform an independent medical examination of Wilson for the circuit courtâ€™s benefit.Â  Dr. Johnsonâ€™s opinion reaffirmed the opinion of the Appeals Committee that Wilson was capable of performing light work.Â \r\n \r\nWhile we recognize that Dr. DeMichele and the Social Security Administration found otherwise, we remain cognizant that as an appellate court, we must affirm an agencyâ€™s decision when substantial evidence supports the decision.Â  See Converse Power Corp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 39, 46, 564 S.E.2d 341, 345 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œUnder our standard of review, we may not substitute our judgment for that of an agency unless the agencyâ€™s findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the whole record.â€).Â  Accordingly, based on the substantial evidence refuting Wilsonâ€™s disability claims, the circuit courtâ€™s award of benefits is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4270","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody Brown, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  John Henry Ward appeals his murder conviction, arguing the trial court erred by (1) refusing to grant a mistrial after the State insinuated the crime revolved around gang activity, (2) permitting autopsy photos to be admitted, (3) charging the jury that â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all,â€ (4) refusing to grant a directed verdict in Wardâ€™s favor, and (5) allowing the State to play a recording of a co-defendantâ€™s testimony from a prior trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the early morning hours of May 11, 2003, Jamie Simmons was fatally wounded when a gunfight broke out in the parking lot area of Club Diamante in Charleston County.Â  Simmons, who had the misfortune of stopping outside the club on his way home from work to speak with his cousin, had not been involved in the altercation.Â  Instead, the tragedy resulted from a long-running feud between residents of two communities â€“ the Petersfield community and the Cherry Hill community.Â  This particular fight erupted when John Campbell, a man from Cherry Hill, danced with the girlfriend of Keith Richards, a man from Petersfield.Â  The fight began indoors, but moved outdoors where it continued to escalate.Â \r\n \r\nOnce outdoors, Campbell ran to a truck where his cousin, Kevin Dunmeyer, was waiting to give Campbell a ride home.Â  As Campbell tried to flee the scene, a group of Petersfield men, which included Appellant Ward and his co-defendant Tremayne Washington, confronted Dunmeyer and Campbell. Â Dunmeyer was separated from his vehicle, so he attempted to flee on foot.Â  As he ran, he was chased by a group of Petersfield men.Â  Dunmeyer was rescued by Antonio Washington, a compatriot from the Cherry Hill community, who drove toward Dunmeyer and attempted to run over anyone from Petersfield who was in the way.Â \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, Appellant Ward, co-defendant Washington, and Catrell Douglas, leapt into a truck and chased after Antonio Washington and Dunmeyer.Â  Before the Petersfield contingent got into the truck, a witness heard co-defendant Washington declare: â€œWe will handle that,â€ and â€œsome bitch is going to die tonight.â€Â  As the two vehicles left the parking lot, heavy gunfire erupted.Â  Later, investigators found shell casings from three different types of guns: a .40-caliber, a 9-millimeter, and a .25-caliber. Â Forensic experts determined it was a 9-millimeter bullet that struck and killed Simmons.Â \r\n \r\nThe State initially tried Ward for the murder of Simmons in December of 2004; the case ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury.Â  Ward was tried again in June of 2005, this time with Tremayne Washington.Â  The two were tried together as accomplices under the theory that both were guilty because â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â \r\n \r\nAt this second trial, numerous witnesses testified regarding the shooting.Â  One witness, James Murphy, remembered that Simmons fell to the ground as soon as the gunfire began but before any shots came from the truck in which Ward rode.Â  Murphy stated that he thought he saw shots fired from the passenger side of the truck.Â  Catrell Douglas, the driver of the truck, testified that Ward fired gunshots out of the window.Â  Although co-defendant Washington did not testify during the second trial, the jury heard testimony from Wardâ€™s first trial, wherein Washington indicated Ward had fired shots toward the other vehicle.Â \r\n \r\nWhen investigators searched the truck, they found an empty holster, a shell casing, an unfired bullet, and magazines, but did not find a gun.Â  At trial, no weapon was introduced into evidence, though records revealing that co-defendant Washington owned a 9-millimeter pistol were entered.Â \r\n \r\nThe jury convicted both Ward and Washington, and they were sentenced to thirty yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWard argues the trial court erred by (1) refusing to grant a mistrial after the prosecutor insinuated the crime revolved around gang activity, (2) permitting autopsy photos to be admitted, (3) charging the jury that â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all,â€ (4) refusing to grant a directed verdict in Wardâ€™s favor, and (5) allowing the State to play a recording of a co-defendantâ€™s testimony from a prior trial.Â  We address each issue in turn below.\r\nI.&nbsp; Insinuation of Gang Activity\r\nWard first argues he is entitled to a new trial because the State repeatedly suggested that he was a gangster, and this insinuation infected the trial with prejudice that denied him due process of the law.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nThe comments about which Ward complains first occurred during opening statements when the prosecutor described the victim as someone who â€œwas not a drinker, was not a drug user, [and] was not a gang banger.â€ Unlike the victim, Ward and his co-defendant were described by the prosecutor as drinkers who â€œwere beating their chest[s] and they [had] something to prove that night.â€ According to Ward, this contrasting description of the victim and the defendants implied that the defendants were â€œdrinking and gang banging at the club.â€Â  Ward also complains that the prosecutor described the fight as being between â€œa gang ofâ€ people from the Cherry Hill community and â€œa bunch of Petersfield people,â€ and later told the jury that Ward was from Petersfield.Â  However, Ward made no objection to the solicitorâ€™s opening argument.\r\nLater in the trial, Kevin Dunmeyer testified that when he attempted to get into his vehicle, there â€œwas a gang of guys at my door.â€Â  In response to this testimony, the prosecutor asked, â€œA gang of guys at your door.Â  Where was this gang of guys from?â€Â  Dunmeyer answered, â€œ[The] Petersfield area.â€Â  Again, Ward did not object to this testimony.\r\nSometime after Dunmeyer testified, a crime scene investigator testified about the discharge of shell casings.Â  The prosecutor asked if the way bullets ejected depended on whether the weapon was held â€œstraight upâ€ or in a â€œgangster hold.â€Â  This time, Ward objected.Â  Then, during the cross-examination of a defense expert, the prosecutor again asked about a method of shooting known as â€œgangster style.â€Â  Wardâ€™s co-defendant objected, and the trial court sustained the objection, advising the jury to disregard the comment.Â  After the defense expert testified, no other witness was called to the stand.Â  Ward moved for a mistrial based on the Stateâ€™s implication that the defendants were gangsters.Â  The trial court denied the motion, but directed the prosecutor to refrain from mentioning gangs in his closing.Â \r\n \r\nâ€œThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 376, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 34, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nHere, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  Ward failed to object to most of the references about which he now complains.Â  In fact, the only objection preserved for our review came when the prosecutor asked the crime scene investigator if the ejection of bullets depended on whether the shooter held the weapon â€œstraight upâ€ or in a â€œgangster hold.â€ Â The other references came in without objection or were objected to by Wardâ€™s co-defendant, and therefore are not preserved for review.Â  See Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 324 n.3, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 n.3 (1997) (explaining that appellant cannot bootstrap an issue for appeal by way of a co-defendantâ€™s objection).Â  We do not believe the isolated reference to which Ward objected warranted the grant of his motion for a mistrial, nor do we believe the combination of references which were unobjected to would require the trial court to grant the motion.Â \r\n \r\nBlackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) defines a gang as â€œ[a] group of persons who go about together or act in concert, esp. for antisocial or criminal purposes.â€Â  Certainly, the groups of people on both sides of this altercation outside of Club Diamante could be referred to as gangs considering their actions that evening.Â  Furthermore, the term â€œgangster styleâ€ described the way the gun may have been fired â€“ from a horizontal position rather than from the normal, vertical position.Â  See Urban Dictionary, available at http://www.urbandictionary.com (â€œTo hold a gun horizontally instead of the way it is normally supposed to be held vertically.â€).Â  Because the Stateâ€™s references to gangs were not completely gratuitous and were unobjected to for the most part, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a mistrial.\r\nII.&nbsp; Autopsy Photographs\r\nWard next argues the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to enter photographs of the victimâ€™s wounds into evidence.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThe relevance, materiality and admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court, and a ruling regarding photographsâ€™ admissibility will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1999).Â  â€œTo constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must create â€˜an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.â€™â€Â  State v. Jackson, 364 S.C. 329, 334, 613 S.E.2d 374, 376 (2005) (quoting State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991)).Â  â€œ[P]hotographs which are calculated to arouse the sympathies or prejudices of the jury should be excluded from the guilt phase of a [trial] if they are irrelevant or not substantially necessary to show material facts or conditions.â€Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 288, 350 S.E.2d 180, 185 (1986).\r\nHere, the trial court allowed two photographs which illustrated graze wounds on the victimâ€™s back.Â  Ward objected, arguing the probative value of the photographs was outweighed by their prejudicial effect.Â  The trial court overruled the objection, finding the juryâ€™s knowledge of the graze wound was necessary to rebut the defenseâ€™s arguments about the angle of the shot, and therefore the photographsâ€™ probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect.Â  This determination is left to the discretion of the trial court, and the record evinces no abuse of that discretion.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Jury Charge on â€œThe Hand of One Is the Hand of Allâ€\r\nWard also argues the trial court erred by charging the jury that â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472-73 (2004).Â  â€œThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.â€ Â State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  If any evidence supports a requested jury charge, the trial court should grant the request.Â  State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n \r\nUnder â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory, â€œone who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.â€Â  State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 648, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1999).Â  Ward argues this theory should not have been charged to the jury because there was no evidence of a common plan or scheme between Ward and his co-defendant.Â  However, evidence revealed that both defendants were with the group of men who confronted Dunmeyer at his truck after the fight spilled outside of the club.Â  As Dunmeyer attempted to run away from the mob, a witness testified that Wardâ€™s co-defendant said, â€œsome bitch is going to die tonight,â€ and â€œwe will handle that.â€Â  The co-defendant and Ward then got into the truck that chased after the car in which Dunmeyer rode.Â  Witnesses also testified that Ward shot his gun toward the other car, and the victim was killed by a stray bullet from this shoot out.Â  After the shooting, the defendants slept at a friendâ€™s house, and Wardâ€™s co-defendant washed his hands with bleach in the morning.Â \r\n \r\nThe evidence at trial supported the theory that Ward and his co-defendant joined together to accomplish an illegal purpose, and therefore it was appropriate for the trial court to instruct the jury that if it found such a joint endeavor existed, each defendant was liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of that endeavor.Â  See id.Â Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury that â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€ \r\n \r\nIV.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nWard next argues the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in his favor.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.â€ State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 270-271, 580 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 2003). Â When ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002). Â â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€ Padgett, 354 S.C. at 271, 580 S.E.2d at 161.Â  â€œHowever, if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, [the appellate court] must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€Â  Id. \r\n \r\nThe gist of Wardâ€™s argument that he is entitled to a directed verdict harkens back to his argument regarding the jury charge:Â  Ward believes there is insufficient evidence to show he and his co-defendant were acting in concert.Â  As explained above, evidence was presented to show that the two were involved in the fight with Dunmeyer; that as Dunmeyer fled, Wardâ€™s co-defendant threatened to kill someone that night; and that moments after that threat, Ward and the co-defendant got into a truck from which gunfire erupted towards the vehicle in which Dunmeyer rode.Â  Furthermore, the driver of the truck as well as the co-defendant stated that Ward was shooting out of the passenger side window of the truck. Â Accordingly, there was some evidence that Ward shot the victim as he fired his weapon toward the other vehicle, and the trial court did not err in sending the case to the jury.\r\nV.&nbsp; Co-Defendantâ€™s Testimony\r\nFinally, Ward argues the trial court erred by allowing the State to play a recording of the testimony given by Wardâ€™s co-defendant during Wardâ€™s first trial.Â  At trial, however, Ward never argued that this former testimony was inadmissible, but instead specifically agreed that the testimony was admissible.[1]Â  Because the issue was never raised or ruled upon by the trial court, it is not preserved for our review. Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€). \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in denying Wardâ€™s motions for a mistrial and directed verdict.Â  We also find no error in the admission of the autopsy photographs or with the jury being instructed that the hand of one is the hand of all.Â  Finally, we find Ward failed to preserve any argument with regard to his co-defendantâ€™s testimony.Â  Accordingly, Wardâ€™s murder conviction is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On appeal, Ward admits he acquiesced to the playing of the former testimony; however, he points out that he later argued â€œthat the prosecution had tried the case differently than in the first trial.â€Â Â Â  According to Ward, this argument related back to â€œa lack of the same motive for cross-examination in the first trial as in the second trial,â€ so the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  We disagree.Â  The record reveals that at the end of the trial, when Ward made his motion for a directed verdict, he argued that the State should be estopped from taking a position in this trial that was different from the position in the first trial.Â  Specifically, he complained that in the first trial, Ward was tried solely as a perpetrator and not as an accomplice, so the defense presented evidence that Tremayne Washington (his co-defendant in the second trial) washed his hands in bleach after the shooting.Â  In the second trial, the State presented the evidence of the hand-washing.Â  However, Ward never argued the trial court erred in allowing his co-defendantâ€™s testimony to be played during his current trial, nor did he argue that the change in the Stateâ€™s strategy prevented him from thoroughly cross-examining his co-defendant during that first trial.Â  Thus, his estoppel argument in no way encompassed the argument he makes on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4271","title":"MID-SOUTH MANAGEMENT v.

Buchheit Trust A, and Beach Cove Associates Joint Venture (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€), appeal from the master-in-equityâ€™s order finding the parent companies of Sherwood Development Corporation were not liable to pay Appellantsâ€™ judgment against Sherwood.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSpartanburg Beach Cove Associates is a general partnership with Mid-South and the William C. Buchheit Trust A as its majority partners.Â  Spartanburg and Sherwood formed a Joint Venture, Beach Cove Associates Joint Venture.Â  Spartanburg had two-thirds interest in the Joint Venture and Sherwood had the remaining one-third interest.[1] Â All income and expenses of the Joint Venture were to be allocated in accordance with the partiesâ€™ percentage interest. Â The sole purpose of the Joint Venture was to develop a multi-unit condominium complex in Myrtle Beach.Â   \r\nSherwood was incorporated by James Clemmons and Mike Gerald, president of Sherwood, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coastal Mortgage Bankers and Realty Company, Inc.Â  Coastal Mortgage is the wholly owned subsidiary of Coastal Federal Savings Bank, which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Coastal Financial Corporation.Â  Â \r\nSherwood was initially capitalized with $10,000, and had no liabilities at its inception.Â  This was sufficient capital to cover the initial investment into the Joint Venture as required by the Joint Venture agreement.Â  Additionally, Coastal Federal provided the financing for the acquisition of the land and construction by the Joint Venture.Â  Sherwood maintained an active board of directors which held routine meetings in order to conduct the business of the corporation.Â  However, the officers and directors of Sherwood were also in various positions of its parent companies and the company did not maintain separate offices. Â While Sherwood failed to have its own employees, the Joint Venture contracted with others to provide services.Â  Finally, Sherwood maintained minutes of the board meetings and appropriate financial records, which were independent of its parent companies. \r\n \r\nThe Joint Venture acquired the property and constructed the condominiums in accordance with the Joint Venture agreement.Â  The parties entered into the project believing it would be profitable and would be able to sustain its own operations.Â  However, the project lost at least $7-8 million, of which Sherwood was responsible for one-third.Â  Sherwood contributed approximately $2.5 million to the Joint Venture as capital calls were made in order to cover the losses generated by the project.Â  The money provided for these capital calls came from Coastal Mortgage.Â  Coastal Mortgage either purchased shares of treasury stock or provided debt funding for Sherwood to continue in operation.Â \r\n \r\nIn 1990, S.M. Johnson expressed his interest in purchasing the commercial operations of the Joint Venture as well as undeveloped land owned by the Joint Venture.Â  In a letter to Vickie Myers, a representative of Spartanburg and the accountant for the Joint Venture, Gerald explained that selling may be in the Joint Ventureâ€™s best interest.Â  Additionally, Gerald explained: Â â€œA major area of concern for our Board is the recently enacted banking legislation which necessitates the divestiture of this type of investment by financial institutions.Â  Therefore, Sherwood Development Corporation may, if operating deficits continue, find that it is incapable of supporting the hotel operation further.â€Â  The deal to sell the commercial operations and property was not approved at that time.Â \r\n \r\nIn 1991, Delmar Jones was hired to act as property manager for the condominium project.Â  He had discussions with the homeownersâ€™ association board members regarding complaints and problems with water intrusion.Â  However, Jones was unclear about whether he ever reported the problems to the Joint Venture, Sherwood, or any of Sherwoodâ€™s representatives.Â  Additionally, Jones believed any problems with water intrusion in the common areas was the problem of the homeownersâ€™ association and not the Joint Venture.Â \r\n \r\nGerald was told in late 1992 by Jack Cochrane, president of the homeownersâ€™ association, that the association had hired an attorney to look into problems related to the parking garage.Â  In addition, Cochrane stated the attorney â€œwould look around and see if he could make that $200,000 case more like a $2 million case.â€Â \r\n \r\nIn February of 1993, the Joint Venture sold the commercial portion of the venture and some undeveloped property to S.M. Johnson.Â  The proceeds from the sale were approximately $1 million.Â  Sherwood received a distribution from the Joint Venture of approximately $330,000 for its one-third share of the proceeds.Â  Spartanburg received the remainder.Â  Sherwood did not pay dividends with the money, but it instead utilized that money to repay debt owed to Coastal Mortgage from its previous capital contributions to the Joint Venture.Â  Spartanburg also made a distribution of its portion of the proceeds to its partners.Â  Neither Sherwood, Spartanburg, nor anyone associated with the Joint Venture proposed setting aside any of the money in a reserve for future capital requirements.Â  \r\n \r\nIn August 1993, the homeownersâ€™ association brought suit against, among others, the Joint Venture, seeking damages resulting from the stucco application and water intrusion. Â As a result, the Joint Venture hired counsel, who began negotiating a possible settlement.Â  Sherwood maintained that it believed the partners of the Joint Venture should not be responsible for payment of any of the settlement.Â  However, Sherwood offered $100,000 towards settlement if the offer was also approved by Coastal Mortgage.Â \r\n \r\n Spartanburg instructed counsel the joint venture would contribute up to $1,000,000 to settle the suit.Â  Counsel was able to settle the suit for a total of $5,450,000.Â  Numerous other defendants and insurance policies contributed to the settlement amount.Â  The Joint Venture was ultimately responsible for $835,000, which was paid by a check drawn on Mid-South Management, one of Spartanburgâ€™s partners.Â  Spartanburg declined Sherwoodâ€™s offer of contributing $100,000 toward the settlement.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter Sherwood refused to pay a capital call for its portion of the settlement amount, Appellants brought suit against Sherwood and its parent companies seeking to recover Sherwoodâ€™s portion of the settlement.Â  After the trial was bifurcated, Sherwood was found liable for one-third of the settlement amount pursuant to the Joint Venture agreement.[2]Â  The second phase of the trial was to determine whether Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies or individual officers should be liable for the judgment obtained against Sherwood.\r\nAppellants proffered three main theories seeking to hold Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies liable: the alter-ego or instrumentality theory, the amalgamation of interest theory, and piercing the corporate veil.Â  At the trial, Appellants offered the testimony of Dr. Oliver Wood, a professor at the University of South Carolina, as an expert to show Sherwood was undercapitalized and operated as an instrument or faÃ§ade for its parent companies. Â Additionally, Dr. Wood testified that all reported accounting indicated that Sherwood was consolidated with its parent companies for reporting purposes.Â  Finally, Appellants showed that Sherwood had no employees, and the officers and board members were all involved with Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies in addition to Sherwood.Â  \r\n \r\nSherwood presented the testimony of Professor John Freeman as its expert.Â  Professor Freeman testified that he believed Sherwood was adequately capitalized and protected by insurance given the nature of its business.Â  In addition, he explained that Sherwood was not established as a sham, but for legitimate business reasons of reducing risk and exposure to liability. Â He testified there was nothing improper in the way Sherwood was run, the method of reporting and recording Sherwoodâ€™s activities, or in the manner in which Sherwood operated.Â  With regard to the repayment of the loan to the parent company, Professor Freeman stated, â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with using some of your cash to pay down your debt. . . . Even if the debt is to your parent corporation.â€\r\n \r\nThe master found piercing the corporate veil was the only theory recognized in South Carolina upon which Appellants could receive relief.Â  The court found the alter-ego or instrumentality theory and the amalgamation of interest theory were reserved for specific circumstances, not present in this case.Â  Finally, the master found Appellants failed to demonstrate that Sherwoodâ€™s corporate veil should equitably be pierced.Â  Accordingly, the master found Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies were not liable for the judgment against Sherwood.[3] Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to pierce the corporate veil is one in equity. Â Thus this court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Dumas v. Infosafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 192, 463 S.E.2d 641, 643 (Ct. App. 1995); see Sturkie v. Sifly, 280 S.C. 453, 456-57, 313 S.E.2d 316, 318 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding that an action to pierce the corporate veil is one in equity and the appellate court takes its own view of the preponderance of the evidence).Â  â€œThe broad scope of review applicable to appeals in equity actions does not, however, require an appellate court to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  Hunting v. Elders, 359 S.C. 217, 223, 597 S.E.2d 803, 806 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. dismissed (Oct. 5, 2005).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the master erred in not finding Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies liable for the judgment Appellants obtained against Sherwood.Â  Appellants assert Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies should be liable because: Â (1) Sherwoodâ€™s corporate veil should be pierced; (2) Sherwood was the mere instrumentality or alter-ego of the parent companies; or (3) the amalgamation of corporate interests, entities, and activities blurs the legal description between the corporations and their activities.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Piercing the Corporate Veil\r\nAppellants maintain the master erred in failing to pierce Sherwoodâ€™s corporate veil and finding the parent companies liable for Sherwoodâ€™s obligations.Â  We find Appellants have failed to prove the necessity for piercing the corporate veil of Sherwood.\r\nIt is generally recognized that a corporation is an entity that is separate and distinct from, and its debts are not the individual debts of, its officers and stockholders.Â  Hunting, 359 S.C. at 223, 597 S.E.2d at 806 (citing DeWitt Truck Brokers, Inc. v. W. Ray Flemming Fruit Co., 540 F.2d 681, 683 (4th Cir. 1976)).Â  Although the corporate entity may be disregarded in some situations, piercing the corporate veil is not a doctrine to be applied without substantial reflection.Â  Baker v. Equitable Leasing Corp., 275 S.C. 359, 367, 271 S.E.2d 596, 600 (1980) (â€œHowever, â€˜piercing the corporate veilâ€™ is not a doctrine to be applied without substantial reflection.â€).Â  Courts are generally reluctant to disregard the corporate entity:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIf any general rule can be laid down, it is that a corporation will be looked upon as a legal entity until sufficient reason to the contrary appears; but when the notion of legal entity is used to protect fraud, justify wrong, or defeat public policy, the law will regard the corporation as an association of persons.Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nSturkie, 280 S.C. at 457, 313 S.E.2d at 318.Â  Thus, courts generally disregard the corporate entity only where equity requires piercing the corporate veil to assist a third party.Â  Woodside v. Woodside, 290 S.C. 366, 370, 350 S.E.2d 407, 410 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œThe corporate form may be disregarded only where equity requires the action to assist a third party.â€).Â  The burden of proof is on the party asserting that the corporate veil should be pierced.Â  Id.\r\nOur courts have outlined a two-prong test to determine whether a corporate veil should be pierced.Â  The first part of the test requires an eight-factor analysis and looks to observance of the corporate formalities by the dominant shareholders. Â Sturkie, 280 S.C. at 457-58, 313 S.E.2d at 318. Â â€œThe second part requires that there be an element of injustice or fundamental unfairness if the acts of the corporation be not regarded as the acts of the individuals.â€Â  Id. Â In determining whether the corporate formalities were observed under the first prong of the Sturkie test, the courts consider eight factors:\r\n\r\n\t(1) whether the corporation was grossly undercapitalized;\r\n\t(2) failure to observe corporate formalities;\r\n\t(3) non-payment of dividends;\r\n\t(4) insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time;\r\n\t(5) siphoning of funds of the corporation by the dominant stockholder;\r\n\t(6) non-functioning of other officers or directors;\r\n\t(7) absence of corporate records;Â  and\r\n\t(8) the fact that the corporation was merely a faÃ§ade for the operations of the dominant stockholder.\r\n\r\nDumas, 320 S.C. at 192, 463 S.E.2d at 644.Â  â€œThe conclusion to disregard the corporate entity must involve a number of the eight factors, but need not involve them all.â€Â  Id. [4] Â  \r\n \r\nUnder the second prong of the Sturkie test, the party seeking to pierce the corporate veil must prove injustice or fundamental unfairness if the corporate veil is not pierced.Â  Multimedia Publâ€™g of S.C., Inc. v. Mullins, 314 S.C. 551, 553, 431 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1993).Â  â€œThe essence of the fairness test is simply that an individual businessman cannot be allowed to hide from the normal consequences of carefree entrepreneuring by doing so through a corporate shell.â€Â  Id. at 556, 431 S.E.2d at 573.Â   \r\nA. Corporate Formalities\r\nReviewing the eight factors to be considered in the first prong of the Sturkie test, we find Appellants did not meet their burden of proving that Sherwood failed to observe corporate formalities.Â  Sherwood was able to meet all capital calls totaling approximately $2.5 million, it observed corporate formalities by having meetings and keeping records, it had functioning officers and directors, and, although it did not have the money to pay its portion of the settlement at the time of this action, there is no evidence that Sherwood was insolvent because it did not have any outstanding debt nor was it otherwise unable to seek additional funding from its parent companies.Â  The repayment of the loan to the parent corporations out of the sole distribution to Sherwood did not amount to the â€œsiphoningâ€ of funds.Â  There was no evidence that Sherwood was â€œmerely a faÃ§adeâ€ for the parent companies.Â  The failure of Sherwood to pay dividends to its shareholders did not amount to fraudulent behavior where the Joint Venture never made a profit and the sole distribution was used to repay a debt to the parent companies.Â  Accordingly, Appellants failed to prove Sherwood did not observe corporate formalities. \r\n \r\nB. Fundamental Unfairness\r\nEven assuming Sherwood failed to observe corporate formalities, Appellants failed to prove that failure to pierce the corporate veil would result in fundamental unfairness.Â  \r\n \r\nThe heart of a piercing the corporate veil dispute lies in proving the second prong of the Sturkie test, which requires a showing of fundamental unfairness in recognizing the corporate entity.Â  The main purpose of piercing the corporate veil is to prevent the likelihood of injustice or unfairness if the limited liability enjoyed by the corporate entity is sustained.Â  Sturkie, 280 S.C. at 458-59, 313 S.E.2d at 318.Â  The burden of proving this fundamental unfairness requires the plaintiff to â€œestablish that (1) the defendant was aware of the plaintiffâ€™s claim against the corporation, and (2) thereafter, the defendant acted in a self-serving manner with regard to the property of the corporation and in disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s claim in the property.â€Â  Dumas, 320 S.C. at 192, 463 S.E.2d at 644.Â  The actual knowledge requirement has been clarified to mean that a person is â€œâ€˜awareâ€™ of a claim against the corporation if he has notice of facts which, if pursued with due diligence, would lead to knowledge of the claim.â€Â  Hunting, 359 S.C. at 229, 597 S.E.2d at 809.\r\nFirst, we must determine the â€œplaintiffâ€™s claimâ€ that is at issue in this action.Â  Appellants assert the â€œclaimâ€ is the likelihood of damages resulting from the potential suit by the homeowners and Sherwood should have taken steps to insure any judgment received by the homeowners could be covered.Â  Sherwood, on the other hand, contends the â€œclaimâ€ is the request by Spartanburg for contribution of money to satisfy Sherwoodâ€™s one-third liability for the amount the Joint Venture was required to pay to settle the homeownersâ€™ claims.Â  Much of the litigation and the Record on Appeal are devoted to attempting to show what Sherwood knew, should have known, or did not know regarding the homeownersâ€™ claims and the potential liability from those claims.Â  However, we find based on the clear language used in numerous cases, the claim to be considered is the claim asserted by Appellants and not the claim asserted by the homeowners against the Joint Venture.Â  See Dumas, 320 S.C. at 192, 463 S.E.2d at 644 (stating that â€œthe defendant was aware of the plaintiffâ€™s claim against the corporationâ€) (emphasis added); Sturkie, 280 S.C. at 459, 313 S.E.2d at 319 (reviewing the plaintiff receiverâ€™s claim against the corporation). \r\n \r\nBased on the record before us, Sherwood would have been aware of Appellantsâ€™ claims no earlier than when the Joint Venture agreed to pay $835,000 towards settlement of the homeownersâ€™ lawsuit.Â  The settlement was reached on February 3, 1997.Â  Prior to this time, Sherwood was under a belief that there would be no requirement of contribution from the Joint Venture and that insurance and other parties would be responsible as had previously taken place when a similar subsidiary of Coastal was involved in a lawsuit and was not responsible for payment of any damages. Â At the time of the settlement, Sherwood should have known that it would be responsible for one-third of the resulting settlement amount.Â  \r\n \r\nThe record is devoid of any evidence of self-serving behavior on the part of Sherwood after February 1997.Â  Nothing in the record indicates Sherwood transferred money, property, or other assets out of the corporation after February 1997.Â  Spartanburg knew of Sherwoodâ€™s resistance to contributing to any proposed settlement based on Sherwoodâ€™s belief that insurance and other parties should be responsible.Â  In addition, Spartanburg turned down a $100,000 proposed payment by Sherwood, contingent on approval by Coastal Mortgage.Â  \r\n \r\nAs to any unfairness, we find Appellants knew at all times that Sherwood was a corporation and enjoyed limited liability.Â  Myers testified that she dealt with Sherwood and not any of the parent companies.Â  Sherwood had previously warned Appellants that it may be forced to cease operations if the operating deficits continued to accrue.Â  This is not a case in which the defendant acted in bad faith or with deceit to take advantage of the plaintiff.Â  The Joint Venture was a business deal among sophisticated parties, and Sherwood contributed over $2 million to the venture due to its continuous losses.Â  Accordingly, we find there is no evidence in the record demonstrating any fundamental unfairness resulting from recognizing the limited liability given to Sherwood as a corporation.\r\nHowever, even assuming Appellants are correct that the â€œclaimâ€ in this case was the likelihood of the Joint Venture being liable to the homeowners, we find Sherwood was not aware of the claim until the suit was filed in August 1993.Â  As discussed in the facts above, Gerald was notified sometime in the fall of 1992 by the homeownersâ€™ association that it hired an attorney due to defects with the parking garage.Â  However, the uncontroverted evidence by Gerald was that he thought the issue with the parking garage was being resolved.Â  In addition, he was told that the attorney for the homeownersâ€™ association planned to look around and see â€œif he could make that $200,000 case more like a $2 million case.â€Â  However, nothing in this statement would put Gerald or Sherwood on notice of the upcoming lawsuit over stucco and water intrusion damage.Â  Gerald testified that when he received the complaint in August 1993, he was shocked, and it was the first time he had any knowledge of the homeownersâ€™ specific allegations.Â \r\n \r\nAppellants attempt to argue Sherwoodâ€™s self-dealing and unfair behavior was the transfer of the $330,000 from Sherwood to its parent company to repay a debt sometime after March 1993.Â  Appellants maintain Sherwood acted improperly by not setting aside an amount in reserve for the potential homeownersâ€™ litigation.Â  However, the testimony by Gerald and Myers reveals that no one from Spartanburg or the other Appellants ever discussed setting up a reserve with the proceeds received from the commercial sale.Â  In addition, Spartanburg distributed its share of the proceeds to its partners and made no attempt to establish a similar reserve that it now demands Sherwood should have done.Â  We find Appellants have presented insufficient evidence that Sherwood acted in a self-serving manner with regard to the property of the corporation and in disregard of Appellantsâ€™ claim in the property.Â  \r\n \r\nAgain, Appellants have failed to demonstrate the unfairness resulting from recognizing the corporate entity in order to pierce the corporate veil of Sherwood, even considering the transfer of the $330,000 to its parent company.Â  As discussed above, these are sophisticated parties who entered into a risky development with the expectation of making a profit that ended in the reality of significant losses.Â  \r\n \r\nRegardless of the date of the â€œclaimâ€ against Sherwood, we find Sherwood and its parent companies did not act in a self-serving or unfair manner.Â  We agree with the master in this case that no injustice or fundamental unfairness results from allowing Sherwood to maintain its corporate status and its shareholders to enjoy the limited liability that accompanies being part of a corporation.\r\nII.&nbsp; Other Grounds\r\nAppellants aver that Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies should also be held liable under either: (1) an alter-ego or instrumentality theory; or (2) an amalgamation of interest or blurred identity theory.Â  We disagree.\r\na.&nbsp; Alter-Ego or Instrumentality Theory\r\nAppellants maintain the master committed error by failing to recognize that Sherwood was the mere instrumentality of its parent companies and in failing to find the parent companies, therefore, liable for Sherwoodâ€™s debts.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur supreme court has recently addressed the application of the alter-ego theory in Colleton County Taxpayers v. School District of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 237, 638 S.E.2d 685, 692 (2006). Â In that case, a non-profit corporation was created by the Colleton County School District to raise funds for renovating existing public school facilities.Â  In determining whether the corporation was the alter-ego of the school district, and thus, subject to the general obligation debt limit imposed on school districts by the South Carolina Constitution, the court stated:\r\n\r\n\tAn alter-ego theory requires a showing of total domination and control of one entity by another and inequitable consequences caused thereby.Â  \r\n\tPeoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 310 S.C. 132, 148, 425 S.E.2d 764, 774 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Control may be shown where the subservient entity manifests no separate interest of its own and functions solely to achieve the goals of the dominant entity.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tId.Â  However, this theory does not apply in the absence of fraud or misuse of control by the dominant entity which results in some injustice.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tId. \r\n\r\nColleton County Taxpayers, 371 S.C. at 237, 638 S.E.2d at 692.Â  The Colleton County court went on to reference Baker v. Equitable Leasing Corporation, 275 S.C. 359, 367-68, 271 S.E.2d 596, 600 (1980), for the theory that control, in and of itself, is not sufficient to find that a subservient corporation is the alter-ego of the dominant one; one must show that the retention of separate corporate personalities would promote fraud, wrong or injustice, or would contravene public policy.Â  Id.Â  Noting that there was no evidence of dominance and control, the court found the corporation was not the alter-ego of the school district.Â  Id. at 238, 638 S.E.2d at 692.  \r\nIn the present case, the master found the alter-ego or instrumentality theory was not appropriate for piercing the corporate veil because, up to that point, our courts had only applied the theory when:Â  (1) recognizing the attorney as the alter-ego of the client; (2) determining whether an employer is liable for the bad acts of its employee; and (3) determining lender liability.[5]Â  The master found that the Sturkie test for piercing the corporate veil was the only way to evaluate corporate structure.Â Â  \r\n \r\nNothing in the Colleton County Taxpayers case limits application of the alter-ego theory solely to the situations listed by the master.Â  In fact, the case cites Baker, a veil-piercing case, to support its finding that the alter-ego theory does not apply in the absence of fraud or misuse of control resulting in injustice.Â  Colleton County Taxpayers, 371 S.C. at 237, 638 S.E.2d at 692; see Baker, 275 S.C. at 367-68, 271 S.E.2d at 600 (noting that piercing the corporate veil is normally only allowed where retaining separate corporate entities would result in fraud, wrong or injustice or would contravene public policy).Â  Although Colleton County Taxpayers was decided after the master determined the underlying case and the master did not have the benefit of reviewing it, it appears that the alter-ego theory also applies in corporate situations.Â  \r\n \r\nNevertheless, we find the alter-ego theory is inapplicable to the present case.Â  While Sherwoodâ€™s officers also held positions in the parent companies, Sherwood maintained separate corporate records.Â  As previously discussed, we find nothing inappropriate about Sherwoodâ€™s transfer of money to its parent companies to repay a debt.Â  Nothing in the record indicates that the â€œdominantâ€ companies misused their control over Sherwood to promote fraud.Â  The record reflects that Sherwood was incorporated to limit liability, not to promote fraud.Â  As Professor Freeman testified at the trial, â€œjust because a business fails doesnâ€™t mean that thereâ€™s been fraud.â€Â  Because there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies abused their control over Sherwood or that a fraud was committed, the alter-ego theory is inapplicable in the present case.Â  Accordingly, the master did not err in finding the parent companies were not liable for the judgment against Sherwood.\r\nb.&nbsp; Amalgamation of Interest or Blurred Identity Theory\r\nAppellants maintain the court erred in failing to find the parent companies liable under an amalgamation of interest theory where the companiesâ€™ interests, entities, and activities blur the identity of the various companies.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Kincaid v. Landing Development Corporation, this court found a sibling company liable for the obligation of another sibling company due to the evidence revealing an â€œâ€˜amalgamation of corporate interests, entities, and activities so as to blur the legal distinction between the corporations and their activities.â€™â€Â  Kincaid v. Landing Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 89, 96, 344 S.E.2d 869, 874 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting the trial courtâ€™s order).Â  In Kincaid, the Landing Development Corporation (LDC), Resort Management Group, Incorporated (RMG), and Resort Construction Corporation (RCC) were all sibling corporations and were sued for negligent construction and breach of warranty. Â Id. at 91, 344 S.E.2d at 871. Â On appeal RMG argued the trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor as it was simply the marketing and sales company.Â  Id. at 96, 344 S.E.2d at 874.Â  However, the Kincaid court found the three companies shared officers, shareholders, and location.Â  In addition, the evidence showed RMG was the â€œproject managerâ€ and was the company who the defendant called to attempt to remedy problems.Â  Finally, company letterhead said:Â  â€œResort Management Group Inc.,â€ with a notation, â€œA Development, Construction, Sales, and Property Management Company.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn Kincaid, this court found sibling companies jointly liable for negligent construction.Â  Kincaid was not a situation in which one company owed a judgment and the court imposed liability upon the parent company or a shareholder.Â  Thus, Kincaid is inapplicable to the present action.Â  \r\n \r\nIn addition, there is no evidence in the record that Spartanburg or the other Appellants could confuse Sherwood with its parent companies.Â  At all times, Appellants dealt only with Sherwood and not Coastal Mortgage.Â  Sherwood had separate letterhead and Myers testified she knew she was dealing only with Sherwood and not Coastal Mortgage.Â  Accordingly, even if the Kincaid amalgamation of interest theory could be used to find a shareholder liable for debts of a corporation, we find Appellants failed to present sufficient evidence to find Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies liable for its judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the master correctly found there was no fundamental unfairness in the way Sherwood conducted business and find Appellants failed to prove a sufficient number of the Sturkie factors to justify piercing the corporate veil.Â  We further find the alter-ego and amalgamation of interest theories are inapplicable to hold Sherwoodâ€™s parent companies liable for the judgment given the circumstances of this case.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the master is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] When the Joint Venture was originally established, a third entity, Beach Cove Development Corporation, was also involved.Â  The original division of ownership was one-half to Spartanburg, and one-fourth to each Sherwood and Beach Cove Development.Â  However, at all times relevant to this appeal, the only two members of the Joint Venture were Spartanburg and Sherwood.\r\n[2] This court upheld the masterâ€™s order in Mid-South Mgmt. Co. v. Sherwood Dev. Corp., Op. No. 2004-UP-611 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 7, 2004).\r\n[3] The master also found that individual officers Michael Gerald and James Clemmons were not liable for the judgment against Sherwood.Â  Appellants have not raised any issue on appeal regarding the liability of the individual officers for the judgment.Â  As a result, that portion of the masterâ€™s order finding the individual officers were not liable is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (finding that an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance).Â \r\n \r\n[4]Â Although Sherwood was not a statutory close corporation, this court has recently noted that the statutory creation of such an entity, designed to lessen the formalities necessary for a corporation, has lessened the importance of some of the Sturkie factors, including:Â  the failure to observe corporate formalities; the nonfunctioning of other officers or other directors; the absence of corporate records; and the nonpayment of dividends.Â  Hunting, 359 S.C. at 225, 597 S.E.2d at 807.Â  \r\n \r\n[5] The master relied upon the following cases in determining what he perceived to be limitations on the application of the alter-ego theory:Â  Williams v. Williams, 335 S.C. 386, 391, 517 S.E.2d 689, 692 (1999) (holding that an attorney is the â€œalter-egoâ€ of his client); Dickert v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 218, 220, 428 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1993) (finding that only dominant corporate owners and officers, and not supervisory employees such as an office manager, may be â€œalter-egosâ€ of employers such that liability falls outside of scope of Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and the matter is not one within exclusive province of the Act); and Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 310 S.C. 132, 148, 425 S.E.2d 764, 774 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that when a lender controls the business decisions and actions of its borrower, the borrower becomes the instrument or alter-ego of the lender).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
