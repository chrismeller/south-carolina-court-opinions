Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh and Senior \r\n          Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and \r\n        Solicitor C. Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n  \r\nMOREHEAD, A.J.: \r\n  A jury convicted Michael Dinkins on charges of kidnapping, armed robbery, possession \r\n  of a weapon during a violent crime, and possession of a pistol by a person under \r\n  the age of twenty-one. The trial court sentenced Dinkins to concurrent terms \r\n  of fifteen years, fifteen years, five years, and five years, respectively. Dinkins \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial court erred in admitting the statement of a witness \r\n  who refused to testify and failing to grant a directed verdict on the charge \r\n  of possession of a pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nOn June 17, 1997, teenagers Chris \r\n  Branham, Amy Vance, and Melanie Lively (collectively, \"the victims\") visited \r\n  a Burger King in Sumter. As they were leaving the parking lot in Branham's Ford \r\n  Explorer, a man approached, put a gun to Branham's chest, and told Branham to \r\n  climb into the back seat. The man assumed the driver's seat as a second man \r\n  got into the back seat. The driver handed the second man the gun and, with the \r\n  victims inside, drove to a field several miles away where the men abandoned \r\n  the victims.\r\n  \r\nOn July 18, 1997, Devon Dinkins (Devon) \r\n  told police that he was at Burger King \"that night\" with Tiawon Tindal, Corey \r\n  Prioleau, and Dinkins. According to Devon, while they were sitting in Tindal's \r\n  car, Prioleau mentioned something about carjacking and Devon expressed disbelief. \r\n  When Prioleau got out of the car, Devon saw that he was armed. Prioleau commented \r\n  about a \"Blazer type vehicle\" with three teenaged passengers: one male and two \r\n  females. As Prioleau and Dinkins walked around the front of Tindal's car, presumably \r\n  toward the Explorer, Devon and Tindal \"didn't believe this was happening\" and \r\n  left.\r\n  \r\nThe police arrested Dinkins on the \r\n  day of Devon's statement and later transported him to a preliminary hearing. \r\n  After the hearing, Dinkins \"blurted\" out to an officer that he \"did it,\" attempted \r\n  to explain why he participated, and offered to help the police recover the gun \r\n  used against the victims.\r\n  \r\nThe State jointly tried Dinkins and \r\n  Prioleau for kidnapping, armed robbery, possession of a weapon during a violent \r\n  crime, and possession of a pistol by a person under twenty-one years of age. \r\n  The jury found both defendants guilty as charged. Dinkins appeals.\r\n  \r\nI. Devon Dinkins's \r\n  Statement\r\n  \r\nDinkins argues the trial court erred \r\n  in admitting Devon's statement into evidence because Devon refused to testify \r\n  at trial. We find no reversible error.\r\n  \r\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a \r\n  criminal defendant the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. VI. The right of confrontation \"is essential to a fair trial \r\n  in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and insures that convictions \r\n  will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.\" \r\n  State v. Martin, 292 S.C. 437, 439, 357 S.E.2d 21, 22 (1987). The Confrontation \r\n  Clause requires a witness to testify under oath and submit to cross-examination \r\n  so that the jury can observe the witness's demeanor and assess his credibility. \r\n  State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. 351, 354, 353 S.E.2d 451, 453 (1987).\r\n  \r\nIn South Carolina, \"[a]n incriminating \r\n  statement admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule also is admissible \r\n  under the Confrontation Clause only if it bears adequate 'indicia of reliability.'\" \r\n  State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, ___, 523 S.E.2d 173, 178 (1999). If a \r\n  hearsay statement falls within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, \r\n  then the statement meets the \"indicia of reliability\" requirement. Id. \r\n  at ___, 523 S.E.2d at 178. An accomplice's confession that inculpates the defendant \r\n  is not admissible under a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule. Lilly \r\n  v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, ___, 119 S. Ct. 1887, 1899 (1999). Such statements \r\n  are considered inherently unreliable because an accomplice is motivated to lie \r\n  in order to shift some, if not all, blame from himself to others. Lilly, \r\n  527 U.S. at ___, 119 S. Ct. at 1897-98; Martin, 292 S.C. at 439, 357 \r\n  S.E.2d at 22.\r\n  \r\nIn this case, the State called Devon \r\n  as its first witness at trial. After answering questions about his name and \r\n  address, Devon invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \r\n  and indicated he would continue to assert that right if asked to testify further. \r\n  Over defense objections, the trial court ruled Devon's statement to police admissible \r\n  as a statement against penal interest under Rule 804(b)(3) of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Evidence. An officer read Devon's statement to the jury.\r\n  \r\nDevon's statement alleges he did \r\n  not participate in or act as an accomplice to any of the various crimes committed \r\n  against the victims. According to Devon, he left when he realized Prioleau and \r\n  Dinkins were about to commit a crime. At the time Devon made the statement to \r\n  police, he did not intend to expose himself to criminal liability, but rather \r\n  to absolve himself. See Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE (statement against penal \r\n  interest must be one that, at the time of its making, tends to expose the declarant \r\n  to criminal liability). Devon's statement was self-serving and thus does not \r\n  qualify as a statement against penal interest.\r\n  \r\nThe trial court erred in admitting \r\n  the statement as a statement against penal interest. See Williamson \r\n  v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 600-01 (1994) (Rule 804(b)(3) \"does not \r\n  allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within \r\n  a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory\"); State v. Singleton, \r\n  303 S.C. 313, 400 S.E.2d 487 (1991) (physical description of defendant must \r\n  be redacted from a nontestifying co-defendant's statement in order to protect \r\n  defendant's right of confrontation); cf. State v. Evans, 316 S.C. \r\n  303, 450 S.E.2d 47 (1994) (admission of co-defendant's confession that, on its \r\n  face, does not incriminate the defendant does not violate the defendant's right \r\n  of confrontation).\r\n  \r\nFurthermore, the statement does not \r\n  qualify under any of the firmly rooted exceptions to the hearsay rule. Cf. \r\n  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 45, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999) (\"excited \r\n  utterance exception is firmly rooted in South Carolina law and satisfies the \r\n  requirements of the Confrontation Clause\"); State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. \r\n  35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (statement made by one conspirator during the conspiracy \r\n  and in furtherance thereof is admissible against co-conspirator without violating \r\n  Confrontation Clause). We, therefore, must conclude the admission of Devon's \r\n  statement violated Dinkins's right of confrontation.(1) \r\n  Having reached this conclusion, we must consider whether the violation warrants \r\n  reversal of his convictions.\r\n  \r\nA violation of the Confrontation \r\n  Clause is not per se reversible error. State v. Jenkins, 322 S.C. \r\n  360, 364, 474 S.E.2d 812, 815 (Ct. App. 1996). We must consider several factors \r\n  to determine whether the error is harmless or requires reversal. These factors \r\n  include the importance of the challenged evidence to the State's case, whether \r\n  the evidence was cumulative, whether the evidence was materially corroborated \r\n  or contradicted by other evidence introduced at trial, the extent of cross-examination \r\n  otherwise permitted, and the overall strength of the State's case. Id. \r\n  at 364-65, 474 S.E.2d at 815.\r\n  \r\nDevon's description of Dinkins approaching \r\n  the victims' car with armed Prioleau shortly after Prioleau talked about carjacking \r\n  the victims' car was not cumulative to other evidence. Devon's statement placed \r\n  Dinkins at the scene of the crime by a person whose ability to identify him \r\n  could not be seriously questioned. Dinkins was deprived of the opportunity to \r\n  cross-examine Devon about his statement or his credibility.\r\n  \r\nUnlike State v. Prioleau, \r\n  Op. No. 3142 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 3, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 \r\n  at 6), where there was confusion surrounding the driver's description and there \r\n  was no voluntary admission, Devon's statement was not significant to the State's \r\n  case. Cf. Jenkins, 322 S.C. at 365, 474 S.E.2d at 815 (where judge \r\n  ruled defendant could not cross-examine police officer about the confidential \r\n  informant where informant was \"linchpin\" in the State's case, defendant's right \r\n  of confrontation was violated). The victims' testimony and Dinkins's admission \r\n  corroborated Devon's account of the evening. Cf. State v. Smith, \r\n  315 S.C. 547, 553, 446 S.E.2d 411, 414 (1994) (where judge limited cross-examination \r\n  of witness, defendant's right of confrontation was not violated because witness's \r\n  testimony was corroborated by other evidence). Furthermore, the State presented \r\n  a particularly strong case against Dinkins. Prior to trial, Lively identified \r\n  Dinkins from a photographic lineup. At trial, Branham and Lively identified \r\n  Dinkins as the man who sat in the back seat. Vance testified she did not see \r\n  the person in the back seat well enough to identify him visually, but when she \r\n  heard Dinkins speak she recognized him as that perpetrator by voice. Because \r\n  the State introduced evidence at trial that each victim identified Dinkins and \r\n  that Dinkins made a voluntary admission to police, we find the admission of \r\n  the challenged statement was harmless.\r\n  \r\nII. Directed \r\n  Verdict\r\n  \r\nDinkins also argues the trial court \r\n  erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the charge of possession \r\n  of a pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one. He argues no evidence was \r\n  introduced as to his age. We find the trial court properly denied Dinkins's \r\n  motion.\r\n  \r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State. \r\n  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998). If there \r\n  is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence tending to prove the defendant's \r\n  guilt, this court must find the motion was properly denied. Id. at 62, \r\n  502 S.E.2d at 69. In considering a directed verdict motion, the trial court \r\n  is concerned with the existence of evidence rather than its weight. Id. \r\n  at 62, 502 S.E.2d at 69.\r\n  \r\nSergeant Mike Hicks, the arresting \r\n  officer, testified at trial that he obtained Dinkins's date of birth as part \r\n  of the normal processing or \"booking\" procedure and that Dinkins was under twenty-one \r\n  years of age at the time of the crime. Sergeant Hicks's testimony was sufficient \r\n  evidence of Dinkins's age for the trial court to submit this charge to the jury.\r\n  \r\nFor the reasons discussed above, \r\n  Dinkins's appealed convictions are \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  Once the United \r\n  States Supreme Court determines a statement does not fall within a firmly rooted \r\n  exception to the hearsay rule, the Court then analyzes whether the statement \r\n  bears any other particularized guarantees of trustworthiness before deciding \r\n  the statement violates the defendant's right of confrontation. Ohio v. Roberts, \r\n  448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980). Our analysis, however, stops once we decide the statement \r\n  does not fall within a firmly rooted exception. Our state supreme court recently \r\n  held we will not consider any other \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" \r\n  when analyzing the admissibility of statements under the Confrontation Clause. \r\n  State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, ___, 523 S.E.2d 168, 172 (1999). But \r\n  see State v. Williams, 285 S.C. 544, 554-55, 331 S.E.2d 354, 360 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1985) (prior to the adoption of the new rules of evidence, appellate \r\n  court discussed admissibility of statement under firmly rooted hearsay exception \r\n  analysis and \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" analysis); cf. \r\n  Richland County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 30, 496 \r\n  S.E.2d 864, 867 (1998) (in child abuse and neglect cases, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180 \r\n  specifically allows the admission of the child's out-of-court statement if the \r\n  child is unavailable and the statement is shown to possess \"particularized guarantees \r\n  of trustworthiness\"). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3142","title":"State v.

Wilder, Jr., of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n  \r\nHOWARD, J.: Corey \r\n  Prioleau was convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery, possession of a weapon \r\n  during a violent crime, and possession of a pistol by a person under the age \r\n  of twenty-one. The trial court sentenced Prioleau to fifteen years for kidnapping, \r\n  fifteen years for armed robbery, and five years for each weapons charge, with \r\n  all sentences running concurrently. Prioleau appeals, arguing the trial court \r\n  erred in (1) admitting a non-self-inculpatory statement of an unavailable witness \r\n  under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE; (2) permitting an unduly suggestive, in-court, photo \r\n  identification of Prioleau as the perpetrator; and (3) failing to grant a directed \r\n  verdict on the charge of possession of a pistol by a person under the age of \r\n  twenty-one. We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nLate in the evening of June 17, 1997, \r\n  teenagers Chris Branham, Amy Vance, and Melanie Lively (victims) were sitting \r\n  together in Branham's Ford Explorer in the parking lot of the Burger King restaurant \r\n  in Sumter, South Carolina. As they began to leave, two men got out of another \r\n  vehicle, leaving two men inside. They began walking towards Branham's Explorer. \r\n  One of the men approached Branham, put a gun to his chest, and told him to climb \r\n  into the back seat. The man assumed the driver's seat, handing the gun to the \r\n  second assailant, who entered the back seat. With the victims inside, the assailants \r\n  drove Branham's Explorer to a field approximately eight miles away, where they \r\n  released the victims. The assailants then left in the Explorer. The \r\n  vehicle was discovered by police the next night, abandoned and destroyed by \r\n  fire.\r\n  \r\nOn July 18, 1997, Devon Dinkins went \r\n  to the police and identified himself as one of the two men who had remained \r\n  in the other vehicle on the night of the incident. He gave the following narrative \r\n  statement:\r\n  \r\nI'll start by who all was there at \r\n  Burger King that night about a month or so ago. It was me, Tiawon Tindal, Michael \r\n  Dinkins, Corey Prioleau. We were having a conversation. I forgot how it got \r\n  started, but Corey was saying something about carjacking. I was telling him \r\n  that I didn't believe he was going to do this because they had talked about \r\n  doing a jacking before or something. Corey looked around and said \"You don't \r\n  believe me\" or something like that and next thing I knew Corey got out the car \r\n  and I seen the gun. I didn't even know the gun was there until then. It was \r\n  a dark gun. He was saying something about a white Suburban or Blazer type vehicle \r\n  that was parked there at Burger King. The people getting into this vehicle were \r\n  young Caucasian kids. I saw about three, one boy and two girls. Corey got out \r\n  the car, Tiawon's car. Mike got out the car. They walked around the front of \r\n  the car and me and Tiawon was saying we didn't believe this was happening. We \r\n  left and went to my neighbor's house and stayed there for about 30 minutes. \r\n  Then I left and went home and Tiawon left and went home. I didn't see Mike or \r\n  Corey again until about two weeks later and the conversation didn't come back \r\n  up. \r\n  \r\nPrioleau and Devon Dinkins's cousin, \r\n  Michael Dinkins, were each charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, possession \r\n  of a weapon during a violent crime, and possession of a pistol by a person under \r\n  twenty-one years of age. \r\n  \r\nIdentification was a major issue \r\n  at trial. According to police notes, at least one of the initial descriptions \r\n  of the assailant who drove Branham's Explorer indicated he was bald. The assailants \r\n  were described to be about 5'8' and 5'9\" tall. Branham and Vance later identified \r\n  Prioleau as the driver from a photo line-up. However, at trial Prioleau was \r\n  described as being about 6'2\" tall, with hair. \r\n  \r\nWhen the State called Devon Dinkins \r\n  as a witness, he refused to testify, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege \r\n  against self-incrimination. The State then offered Dinkins's pre-trial statement. \r\n  The defense objected on multiple grounds, including that the statement was inadmissible \r\n  hearsay. The court admitted the statement under the hearsay exception found \r\n  in Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, as a prior statement by an unavailable witness which \r\n  was against the declarant's penal interest. \r\nThe jury found Prioleau guilty as \r\n  charged. This appeal follows.\r\n  \r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial court abuse \r\n  its discretion by admitting the statement of Devon Dinkins into evidence pursuant \r\n  to Rule 804(b)(3)?\r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court err \r\n  by allowing an in-court photographic identification of Prioleau as the perpetrator? \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII. Did the trial court \r\n  err in denying the motion for directed verdict on the charge of possession of \r\n  a pistol by a minor?\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial court abuse \r\n  its discretion by admitting the statement of Devon Dinkins into evidence pursuant \r\n  to Rule 804(b)(3)?\r\n  \r\nFirst, Prioleau claims the trial \r\n  court erred in admitting the statement of Devon Dinkins. We agree. \r\n  \r\nAn abuse of discretion standard is \r\n  applied to a trial court's ruling on the issue of whether a statement is admissible \r\n  as a declaration against penal interest under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE. State \r\n  v. Kinloch, Op. No. 25044 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed January 10, 2000) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 39). Where the statement is not offered to exculpate the accused, \r\n  the rule provides a two step inquiry. The first step is to determine that the \r\n  witness is unavailable. In this case, satisfaction of this criterion is not \r\n  disputed. See Rule 804(a)(1)&amp;(2), SCRE; State v. Doctor, 306 \r\n  S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992). The second prong of the inquiry is to determine \r\n  whether the statement was at \r\n  the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary \r\n  interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, \r\n  or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable \r\n  person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless \r\n  believing it to be true. \r\n  \r\nRule 804(b)(3), SCRE.\r\n  \r\nOur supreme court recently decided \r\n  that Rule 804(b)(3) does not allow the admission of a non-self-inculpatory statement \r\n  which is collateral to a self-inculpatory statement. State v. Fuller, \r\n  337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999). The court noted that Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, \r\n  is identical to federal rule 804(b)(3). Consequently, the court relied upon \r\n  the United States Supreme Court's analysis of the federal rule as found in Williamson \r\n  v. United States, 512 U.S. 594 (1994). \r\n  \r\nIn Williamson, the Supreme \r\n  Court considered the scope of this hearsay exception in the context of circumstances \r\n  analogous to those here. The plurality opinion of the Court contains several \r\n  general observations which provide helpful guidance to the trial court, and \r\n  are pertinent to the analysis in this case. \r\n  \r\nAs the Court first observed, \"Rule \r\n  804(b)(3) is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even \r\n  reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory \r\n  statements unless they believe them to be true.\" Williamson, 512 U.S. \r\n  at 599. But as the Court explained, the fact that a person makes a confession \r\n  which is broadly self-inculpatory does not make more credible those portions \r\n  of the confession which are not self-inculpatory. \"One of the most effective \r\n  ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly \r\n  persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature.\" Id. at 599-600. \r\n  \r\nWhen the statement is actually self-exculpatory, \r\n  \"the generalization on which Rule 804(b)(3) is founded becomes even less applicable \r\n  . . .[because] [s]elf-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones which people \r\n  are most likely to make even when they are false.\" Id. at 600. Consequently, \r\n  the Court concluded that \"the most faithful reading of Rule 804(b)(3) is that \r\n  it does not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they \r\n  are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory.\" Id. \r\n  at 600-601.\r\n  \r\nThe question of whether a statement \r\n  is self-inculpatory must be answered by viewing the statement in the context \r\n  of all the circumstances. \"The question under Rule 804(b)(3) is always whether \r\n  the statement was sufficiently against the declarant's penal interest 'that \r\n  a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement \r\n  unless believing it to be true,' and this question can only be answered in light \r\n  of all the surrounding circumstances.\" Id. at 603-604. \r\n  \r\nTurning to Devon Dinkins's statement, \r\n  we conclude that all but the first three sentences of the statement are clearly \r\n  inadmissible. Devon Dinkins's statement is far from self-inculpatory. Indeed, \r\n  it is highly suspect by virtue of its selectivity and self-exculpatory nature. \r\n  Dinkins was present in the car, and the vehicle was seen by various witnesses \r\n  who testified at trial. According to Deputy Hicks, Devon Dinkins met the description \r\n  of the backseat assailant, as did his cousin Michael. It is not unreasonable \r\n  to assume that as the police investigation narrowed, Devon Dinkins anticipated \r\n  being identified as one of the four people in the assailants' car, thereby implicating \r\n  him in the crime. In contrast to his disclosure of being present at the Burger \r\n  King on the night in question with Prioleau, his cousin Michael, and Tiawon \r\n  Tindal, the remainder of his statement does not admit to any wrongdoing on his \r\n  part. Indeed, it sets the stage for total exoneration as an innocent bystander \r\n  who left before the crime was committed. Aside from the admission of being present, \r\n  the remainder of the statement is not, under any reasonable view, against the \r\n  penal interest of the declarant. See Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. \r\n  530, 541 (1986) (\"Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and \r\n  to exonerate himself, a codefendant's statements about what the defendant said \r\n  or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\").(1) \r\n  \r\nThere may be a portion of Dinkins's \r\n  statement which the trial court could determine to be admissible under the analysis \r\n  outlined in Williamson and Fuller, but that is a decision for \r\n  the trial court in the first instance. But see Williamson, 512 \r\n  U.S. at 608 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (noting that the arguably self-inculpatory \r\n  statements in that case were too closely intertwined with the self-serving declarations \r\n  to be ranked as trustworthy). Even if all or a portion of the first part of \r\n  the statement placing Devon Dinkins with Prioleau, Tindal, and Michael Dinkins \r\n  at the scene of the crime is sufficiently self-inculpatory to be considered \r\n  trustworthy, the remainder of the narrative is not self-inculpatory, and it \r\n  was error to have admitted it. Id. at 600-601. (\"In our view, the most \r\n  faithful reading of Rule 804(b)(3) is that it does not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory \r\n  statements, even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally \r\n  self-inculpatory.\"); see also Fuller, 337 S.C. at ___, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  at 172. \r\n  \r\nHaving concluded the introduction \r\n  of Dinkins' statement under Rule 804(b)(3) was an error constituting an abuse \r\n  of discretion, we must now consider whether the error warrants reversal of Prioleau's \r\n  convictions. \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Dinkins, Op. No. \r\n  3141 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 3, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 1), this \r\n  Court affirmed the conviction of Prioleau's co-defendant, Michael Dinkins. Despite \r\n  finding that the trial court erred in admitting Devon Dinkins's statement, this \r\n  Court concluded the error was harmless.(2) However, \r\n  in this case, we find that Devon Dinkins's statement was critical evidence in \r\n  the State's case against Prioleau and therefore its admission cannot be considered \r\n  harmless error. The statement placed Prioleau armed with a pistol at the scene \r\n  of the crime by a person who knew him and whose ability to identify him could \r\n  not be seriously questioned and described Prioleau's comments about car-jacking \r\n  and his approach towards the victims' car. This evidence was not cumulative \r\n  to other testimony. See State v. Ballen, 333 S.C. 378, 510 S.E.2d \r\n  226 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding error in the admission of hearsay testimony harmless, \r\n  where testimony was merely cumulative to other properly admitted evidence). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe only corroboration of this evidence \r\n  was the testimony of the victims, whose identification of Prioleau was subject \r\n  to attack because the early descriptions of the driver arguably did not match \r\n  him. The victims' identifications of Prioleau were not as strong as their identifications \r\n  of Michael Dinkins. \"When a witness' testimony is disputed or his credibility \r\n  called into question, other testimony verifying the facts or opinions given \r\n  by the witness is not merely cumulative.\" Doctor, 306 S.C. at 530, 413 \r\n  S.E.2d at 38. Moreover, Prioleau made no self-incriminating statements to police, \r\n  whereas Michael Dinkins admitted his involvement to police. Considering these \r\n  factors, we find the error in admitting the statement cannot be considered harmless. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court err \r\n  by allowing an in-court photographic identification of Prioleau as the perpetrator?\r\n  \r\nNext, Prioleau asserts the trial \r\n  court erred in allowing the State to conduct an in-court photo identification \r\n  of him while he was in plain view of the witness. We agree.\r\n  \r\nTwo of the victims viewed the photo \r\n  line-up and identified a picture of Prioleau as that of their assailant. The \r\n  third victim, Lively, was not available to view the photo line-up, and did not \r\n  attempt to identify Prioleau from it prior to trial. Instead, with Prioleau \r\n  sitting at the defense table, the assistant solicitor showed Lively the photo \r\n  lineup and, over defense objection, she picked out Prioleau's picture. Lively \r\n  subsequently testified, without objection, that she had positively identified \r\n  Prioleau at the preliminary hearing, and she further identified him without \r\n  objection in the courtroom. \r\n  \r\nIt can hardly be argued that allowing \r\n  a witness to identify the accused from a photographic line-up while the accused \r\n  sits in plain view at nearby counsel table is a proper identification procedure, \r\n  absent some special circumstances not present here. There can be no question \r\n  but that this procedure is unduly suggestive. Ordinarily, an unduly suggestive \r\n  identification procedure will cause the exclusion of an identification where, \r\n  based on various factors, there is a substantial likelihood of misidentification. \r\n  State v. Washington, 323 S.C. 106, 473 S.E.2d 479 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  \r\nPrioleau did not object to the subsequent \r\n  identification testimony by the witness, and a careful reading of his argument \r\n  on appeal reflects that he does not contend the in-court, face to face, identification \r\n  was a product of the improper photo line-up procedure. For this reason, we do \r\n  not analyze whether the circumstances of this improper identification procedure \r\n  affected the subsequent in-court identification, such that there is \"a very \r\n  substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\" See State \r\n  v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 451, 272 S.E.2d 628, 630 (1980); Simmons v. \r\n  United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968). \r\n  \r\nHowever, the use of this procedure \r\n  was prejudicial, notwithstanding the victim's allegedly independent identification \r\n  at trial, because it improperly bolstered the initial photographic line-up identifications \r\n  made by the remaining two victims. There was little likelihood the witness would \r\n  be unable to identify Prioleau's photograph while he was seated across from \r\n  her in the courtroom. By selecting his picture, the witness gave undeserved \r\n  credibility to the pre-trial identifications made by the remaining two victims. \r\n  We have previously discussed the critical nature of this testimony, and need \r\n  not restate it here. Under these circumstances, the improper bolstering was \r\n  not harmless error. See State v. Barrett, 299 S.C. 485, 386 S.E.2d \r\n  242 (1989). \r\n \r\nIII. Did the trial court \r\n  err in denying the motion for directed verdict on the charge of possession of \r\n  a pistol by a minor?\r\n  \r\nIn his last argument, Prioleau asserts \r\n  the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the charge \r\n  of possession of a pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one. He contends \r\n  no evidence was introduced as to his age. We find this argument to be without \r\n  merit. \r\n  \r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State \r\n  and if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence tending to \r\n  prove the defendant's guilt, the appellate court must find the motion was properly \r\n  denied. State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998). In considering \r\n  a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned with the existence of \r\n  evidence rather than with its weight. Id.\r\n  \r\nSergeant Mike Hicks, the officer \r\n  who arrested Prioleau, testified that he obtained Prioleau's date of birth as \r\n  part of the normal processing or \"booking\" procedure. He testified further that \r\n  at the time of the crime, Prioleau was under twenty-one years of age. We conclude \r\n  this testimony was sufficient evidence of Prioleau's age to require submission \r\n  of this charge to the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Prioleau's \r\n  convictions are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND \r\n  REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nCURETON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Though Devon \r\n  Dinkins was not arrested for the crime, we believe his statement must also be \r\n  viewed with suspicion because he is a possible accomplice. See State \r\n  v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999) (collateral, non-self-inculpatory \r\n  statement of possible accomplice inadmissible); see also Lee, \r\n  476 U.S. at 541 (\"when one person accuses another of a crime under circumstances \r\n  in which the declarant stands to gain by inculpating another, the accusation \r\n  is presumptively suspect\"). \r\n2.  Both Prioleau \r\n  and Michael Dinkins argued on appeal that the statement's admission violated \r\n  their Confrontation Clause rights. Although this court addressed this argument \r\n  in Dinkins, we need not address it here because we reverse on the ground \r\n  that the statement constituted inadmissable, prejudicial hearsay under the Rules \r\n  of Evidence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3143","title":"Duval v.

Duval, as Personal Representative of the Estate of her \r\n  husband, Edward Duval, Sr., to stop the accrual of statutory post-judgment interest \r\n  pending both parties' appeals in the underlying action. The trial court granted \r\n  the motion and ordered Heritage to include with the deposit the statutory interest \r\n  that accrued from the date of the judgment to the date of the deposit of funds \r\n  into a Merrill Lynch account. Heritage appeals arguing Duval is not entitled \r\n  to any statutory interest because she appealed the insufficiency of the award \r\n  in the underlying action. Duval cross-appeals asserting the judgment debtor's \r\n  deposit of the funds should not stop the accrual of statutory interest. We affirm.(1)\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nDuval sued Heritage for breach of \r\n  contract and bad faith failure to pay the proceeds of a life insurance policy. \r\n  A jury found in favor of Duval on the contract claim and in favor of Heritage \r\n  on the bad faith claim. On December 2, 1997, the trial court denied both parties' \r\n  motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but granted Duval's motion \r\n  for pre-judgment interest accruing from the date Heritage denied her claim. \r\n  The total award, including the breach of contract judgment and pre-judgment \r\n  interest, was $110,639.71. Duval and Heritage appealed.(2)\r\n  \r\nHeritage filed in the supreme court \r\n  a motion to deposit the amount of the judgment and pre-judgment interest with \r\n  the court of appeals pending the outcome of the parties' appeal. After the supreme \r\n  court transferred the appeal, this court denied the motion, finding Heritage \r\n  should direct the motion to the trial court. Heritage subsequently filed a motion \r\n  in the trial court to deposit $110,639.71. Heritage asserted Duval was not entitled \r\n  to any post-judgment interest because she was the first to appeal the underlying \r\n  jury verdict of $87,571.70. Heritage sought to avoid any argument over Duval's \r\n  entitlement to post-judgment interest by depositing the funds with the court, \r\n  thereby terminating the accrual of statutory interest. Duval opposed the motion, \r\n  asserting she was entitled to post-judgment interest during the pendency of \r\n  Heritage's appeal. She also argued against precedent that a judgment debtor \r\n  should not be allowed to avoid post-judgment interest by depositing the judgment \r\n  amount with the court. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court granted Heritage \r\n  leave pursuant to Rule 67, SCRCP, to deposit with the clerk of court the judgment \r\n  amount plus additional interest accruing on that amount at the post-judgment \r\n  interest rate of fourteen percent per annum from the date of judgment until \r\n  the date of deposit. The court then ruled that statutory post-judgment interest \r\n  would not accrue upon deposit of the funds into an interest-bearing Merrill \r\n  Lynch account. Regarding Duval's entitlement to post-judgment interest during \r\n  the pendency of Heritage's appeal, the court found the issue to be unripe because \r\n  the court could not ascertain whether Duval would be an unsuccessful judgment \r\n  creditor in the appeal on the merits.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nHeritage's appeal\r\n  \r\nHeritage argues Duval is not entitled \r\n  to any post-judgment interest or interest that accrues on the deposited amount \r\n  because she appealed the underlying order of judgment. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nIn Sears v. Fowler,(3) \r\n  the supreme court, adopting the majority rule, held \"[a] judgment creditor who \r\n  appeals based on the insufficiency of the verdict is not entitled to interest \r\n  during the pendency of the appeal when the verdict is later upheld.\" The rationale \r\n  for the rule is that a judgment creditor's appeal delays his or her right to \r\n  the judgment, and the debtor, therefore, should not be required to pay interest.(4)\r\n  \r\nDuval, however, did not appeal the \r\n  insufficiency of the judgment by challenging the amount of the jury's award \r\n  on her breach of contract claim. Instead, she appealed the verdict in favor \r\n  of Heritage on the bad faith claim. Duval argued the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to grant her a directed verdict motion on the contract claim. Duval maintained \r\n  the jury verdict on the bad faith cause of action may have differed if a breach \r\n  of the contract had been established as a matter of law because the jury would \r\n  no longer have been considering whether a contract existed between the parties. \r\n  Duval was appealing, therefore, the issue of liability and not the inadequacy \r\n  of the award.\r\n  \r\nHeritage's appeal, rather than Duval's \r\n  appeal, delayed her receipt of the judgment. We find Duval is entitled to the \r\n  post-judgment interest that accrued prior to Heritage's depositing of the funds \r\n  with the clerk of court and the interest on the deposited funds that accrued \r\n  pending the appeal of the underlying order.\r\n  \r\nDuval's appeal\r\n  \r\nDuval argues against precedent that \r\n  a judgment debtor should not be allowed to avoid post-judgment interest by depositing \r\n  the amount of the judgment with the court. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nIn Russo v. Sutton,(5) \r\n  the supreme court held a judgment debtor's deposit of funds into court pursuant \r\n  to Rule 67, SCRCP, pending the debtor's own appeal stops the accrual of interest \r\n  on the judgment. The rationale was that \"such a rule encourages the debtor to \r\n  pay the judgment and assures the judgment creditor the funds will be available.\"(6) \r\n  This court has followed that rule.(7)\r\n  \r\nThe court of appeals is bound by \r\n  the decisions of the supreme court.(8) Where \r\n  the law is unmistakably clear, this court has no authority to change it.(9) \r\n  We affirm the trial court on this issue.\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.

During the course of their marriage, \r\n  Samuel and Jean jointly purchased a house on Lake Cheohee (Lake property).\r\n  \r\nOn November 17, 1983, in an effort \r\n  to receive a tax break, Jean conveyed to Samuel a one-half interest in the Walhalla \r\n  house. That same day, Samuel executed a will leaving his interest in the Walhalla \r\n  house to Jean's children if Jean predeceased him.\r\n  \r\nOn July 20, 1994, Samuel executed \r\n  a deed purportedly conveying his interest in the Walhalla house and Lake property \r\n  to his daughters, Mariner and Parker, reserving a life estate in the properties \r\n  for himself. Samuel instructed the attorney who prepared the deed that he did \r\n  not want Jean to know about the transfer. The attorney mailed the deed to Mariner, \r\n  with instructions to record the deed after Samuel's death. The same day he executed \r\n  the deed, Samuel executed a new will devising his estate to Jean. The will provided \r\n  that his estate be equally divided between his and Jean's children should Jean \r\n  predecease him.\r\n  \r\nSamuel passed away on May 31, 1995. \r\n  Mariner recorded the deed shortly after his death. Jean subsequently brought \r\n  this action to determine the validity of the deed.\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\nBefore addressing the substantive \r\n  issues on appeal, we must first define the appropriate standard of review. Determination \r\n  of the proper standard of review turns on whether the case is legal or equitable.(2)\r\n  \r\nAt trial, Donnan argued, and the \r\n  master agreed, that the deed was void for lack of delivery. An action to set \r\n  aside a deed for lack of delivery is an action at law.(3) \r\n  Accordingly, we are limited in our review to corrections of errors of law and \r\n  a determination of whether or not there is any evidence to support the trial \r\n  judge's findings.(4)\r\n  \r\nDonnan also sought avoidance or cancellation \r\n  of the deed on several additional grounds. Donnan first argued that the trial \r\n  judge should impose a constructive or resulting trust for the benefit of Jean's \r\n  estate. Donnan also argued that the deed was procured through undue influence.(5) \r\n  It is clear that both of these causes of action are in equity.(6) \r\n  As such, we may determine the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.(7) We, however, will not disregard \r\n  the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a \r\n  better position to judge their credibility.(8) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\n1. Delivery of the deed\r\n  \r\nMariner and Parker argue the referee \r\n  erred in finding no effective delivery of the deed. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nA deed is not legally effective until \r\n  it has been delivered.(9) While there is no prescribed \r\n  method for an effective delivery of a deed, manual transfer of the instrument \r\n  into the hand of the grantee is neither required to effectuate a valid delivery, \r\n  nor dispositive of the issue.(10) The term delivery \r\n  in this regard refers to \"not so much a manual act but the intention of the \r\n  maker . . . existing at the time of the transaction . . . and not subject to \r\n  later change of mind.\"(11) \"Delivery of a deed \r\n  includes, not only an act by which the grantor evinces a purpose to part with \r\n  the control of the instrument, but a concurring intent thereby to vest the title \r\n  in the grantee.\"(12)  \r\n  \"The controlling question of delivery in all cases is one of intention.\"(13)\r\n  \r\nThe trial judge found Samuel's actions \r\n  contradicted any intent to transfer the properties. Although Samuel sent the \r\n  deed to Mariner, he instructed her that the deed was not to be recorded until \r\n  after his death. Mariner was instructed not to tell Jean or her sister about \r\n  the deed. Despite the alleged transfer of the property, Samuel continued to \r\n  exercise control over the lake property inconsistent with the life estate he \r\n  retained in the property. Three months after executing a deed, Samuel and Jean \r\n  conveyed a portion of the lake property, in fee simple, to a neighbor in order \r\n  to settle a property line dispute. Moreover, Bobby Long, the Owens' next-door \r\n  neighbor testified that Samuel often talked about selling the lake property \r\n  to Long, even after Samuel allegedly transferred the property to his daughters, \r\n  and had even gone so far as to state a price for the property.\r\n  \r\nWe find ample evidence to support \r\n  the trial judge's finding that Samuel did not intend to part with control of \r\n  the properties during his lifetime. Because Samuel did not effectively deliver \r\n  the deed prior to his death, it is invalid.(14)\r\n  \r\n2. Resulting trust\r\n  \r\nMariner and Parker next argue the \r\n  referee erred in finding a resulting trust arose in favor of Jean's estate as \r\n  to the Walhalla house. We disagree.\r\n  \r\n A resulting trust arises to effectuate \r\n  the intent of the parties in certain situations where one party pays for property, \r\n  in whole or in part, that for a different reason is titled in the name of another.(15) \r\n  Generally, when real estate is conveyed to one person and the consideration \r\n  paid by another, it is presumed that the party who pays the purchase money intended \r\n  a benefit to himself, and accordingly a resulting trust is raised in his behalf.(16) \r\n  The presumption may be rebutted and the actual intention shown by parol evidence.(17) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn contrast, when the conveyance \r\n  is given to a spouse or child, or to any other person for whom the purchaser \r\n  is under legal obligation to provide, the presumption is that the purchase was \r\n  designated as a gift or advancement to the person to whom the conveyance is \r\n  made.(18) This presumption, however, may be \r\n  rebutted by parol evidence or circumstances showing a contrary intention.(19) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nJean and her first husband purchased \r\n  the Walhalla house together. The mortgage on the house was satisfied by insurance \r\n  proceeds Jean received upon his death. For several years Jean refused Samuel's \r\n  requests that she give him an interest in the house. She reluctantly transferred \r\n  a half-interest in the Walhalla house to Samuel in order to qualify for a tax \r\n  exemption. Jean, however, did not want Samuel's daughters to inherit the house. \r\n  Samuel agreed that his daughters would not share in the house. Jean stated the \r\n  only reason she consented to the transfer was because Samuel executed a will \r\n  that devised the house to her, or if she predeceased him, to her children.\r\n  \r\nWe find the evidence sufficient to \r\n  rebut the presumption that Jean intended to make a gift of the Walhalla house \r\n  to Samuel.\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

In this negligence \r\n  action, Gerald D. Wade, Jr., appeals from the trial court's order granting summary \r\n  judgment to Berkeley County pursuant to the Tort Claims Act.(1) \r\n  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nOn the morning of June \r\n  1, 1995, Bobby Joe Pierce was driving his personal vehicle to his job as an \r\n  animal control officer with Berkeley County. While on the way, Pierce stopped \r\n  to determine if a dead dog on the side of the road was wearing a collar. The \r\n  night before, Pierce received a phone call from a woman who informed him the \r\n  dog had been run over and was dead. According to Pierce, after resuming his \r\n  trip to work, he was forced to drive into the left hand lane to avoid a John \r\n  Doe driver who suddenly stopped in front of him. Pierce's car collided head \r\n  on with Wade's vehicle.\r\n  \r\nWade filed a negligence \r\n  action against Pierce and the John Doe driver. In the initial complaint, Wade \r\n  made no allegation concerning Pierce's employment with the County. In his deposition, \r\n  Pierce testified he stopped to check on the dead animal because that was his \r\n  job and he considered himself on the job at the time.&nbsp; Subsequently, Pierce's \r\n  personal liability insurance carrier paid Wade $13,000 in exchange for a Covenant \r\n  Not to Execute Judgment. At the time of this payment, Wade had made no claim \r\n  against Berkeley County.\r\n  \r\nThereafter, Wade filed \r\n  an amended complaint against Berkeley County, pursuant to the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act, and John Doe as a result of the same accident. Pierce was not \r\n  a named party in the amended complaint. Wade alleged Pierce was acting as an \r\n  agent and servant of the County at the time of the accident. The County denied \r\n  this allegation and averred as an affirmative defense the action was barred \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(d) (Supp. 1999), which addresses the effect \r\n  of a judgment or settlement. The County filed a motion for summary judgment(2) \r\n  based upon this section.\r\n  \r\nIn granting the motion, the trial \r\n  court held Berkeley County was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law \r\n  \"since there was a prior settlement of Wade's personal injury claims between \r\n  Wade and an alleged tortfeasor-employee (i.e., Pierce) for the same occurrence.\" \r\n  The court concluded \"[t]his settlement constitutes a complete bar to any further \r\n  action by Wade against the relevant governmental entity--employer (i.e., Berkeley \r\n  County) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-70(d).\"\r\n  \r\nISSUES\r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial court err in ruling \r\n  there was a full settlement between Wade and Pierce?\r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment based on his conclusion the execution of the document constituted \r\n  \"a settlement of a claim\" initiated under the Tort Claims Act?\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mosteller v. County of Lexington, \r\n  336 S.C. 360, 520 S.E.2d 620 (1999); Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, \r\n  the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. \r\n  Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); \r\n  Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, \r\n  518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999). If triable issues exist, those issues must go \r\n  to the jury. Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, 409 S.E.2d 366 (1991); \r\n  Young, supra.\r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the \r\n  application of the law. Mosteller, supra. All ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against \r\n  the moving party. Vermeer, supra. Even when there is no dispute \r\n  as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be \r\n  drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Id. Because it \r\n  is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues. Baughman \r\n  v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991).\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS(3)\r\n  \r\nI. EFFICACY OF SETTLEMENT \r\n  DOCUMENTS UNDER\r\n  SOUTH CAROLINA JURISPRUDENCE\r\n  \r\nWithout a jury verdict, order of \r\n  judgment, or confession of judgment, cases are disposed of by way of amicable \r\n  disposition under the aegis and ambit of three recognizable legal documents \r\n  effectuating the settlement: (1) general release; (2) covenant not to \r\n  sue; and (3) covenant not to execute. The bench and bar have great concernment \r\n  in regard to the avenues of disposition available to party litigants, especially \r\n  in the proliferating multi-party litigation, such as product liability, professional \r\n  malpractice, and construction litigation. Attorneys representing litigants subsumed \r\n  in multi-party litigation ofttimes seek to extricate a party while the remaining \r\n  parties litigate to an ultimate resolution. A cardinal principle inherent in \r\n  the settlement process is the utilitarian use of the proper document to achieve \r\n  the desired result, i.e., the salvation of the party from further liability \r\n  or exposure. We analyze with certitude the precedent governing the documents \r\n  to achieve the ultimate goals of the parties.\r\n  \r\nA. General Release\r\n  \r\nThe term \"release\" has been defined \r\n  as the \"relinquishment, concession, or giving up of a right, claim, or privilege, \r\n  by the person in whom it exists or to whom it accrues, to the person against \r\n  whom it might have been demanded or enforced.\" 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ \r\n  2 (1994). A release is an agreement providing that a duty owed to the maker \r\n  of the release is discharged immediately. Id. See also Black's \r\n  Law Dictionary 1289 (6th ed. 1990)(a release is a writing or \r\n  oral statement manifesting an intention to discharge another from an existing \r\n  or asserted duty). A release is contractual in nature. 76 C.J.S. Release \r\n  Â§ 2. Whether a particular agreement constitutes a release is to be determined \r\n  from the intent of the parties. Id.\r\n  \r\nUnder the common law, the release \r\n  of one of multiple joint tortfeasors, regardless of the intention of the parties, \r\n  released all. Bartholomew v. McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 179 S.E.2d 912 \r\n  (1971). In Bartholomew, the Court rejected this common law rule and \r\n  held:\r\n  \r\nBeing untrammeled by the ancient \r\n  rule which, in our view, tends to stifle settlements, defeat the intention of \r\n  parties and extol technicality, we adopt the view that the release of one tort-feasor \r\n  does not release others who wrongfully contributed to plaintiff's injuries unless \r\n  this was the intention of the parties, or unless plaintiff has, in fact, received \r\n  full compensation amounting to a satisfaction.\r\n  \r\nBartholomew, 255 S.C. at \r\n  492, 179 S.E.2d at 914. See also Scott by McClure v. Fruehauf Corp., \r\n  302 S.C. 364, 396 S.E.2d 354 (1990)(release of one tortfeasor does not constitute \r\n  release of others who contributed to plaintiff's injuries unless parties intended \r\n  such a release or plaintiff received full satisfaction).\r\n  \r\nB. Covenant Not to \r\n  Sue\r\n  \r\nThe covenant not to sue was developed \r\n  at common law to permit the release of one or more joint tortfeasors without \r\n  affecting the covenantor's rights against the other joint tortfeasors. A covenant \r\n  not to sue is a covenant by one who had a right of action at the time of making \r\n  it against another person, by which he agrees not to sue to enforce such right \r\n  of action. 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 4 (1994). \"Such covenant does not extinguish \r\n  a cause of action and does not release other joint tort-feasors even if it does \r\n  not specifically reserve rights against them.\" Black's Law Dictionary \r\n  364 (6th ed. 1990). However, one tortfeasor is entitled to credit \r\n  for the amount paid by another tortfeasor for a covenant not to sue. See \r\n  Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 156 S.E.2d 759 (1967).\r\n  \r\nA covenant not to sue is not a release. \r\n  76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 4. \"The difference is one of intent and grows out \r\n  of the construction placed on the terms of the instrument, since a covenant \r\n  not to sue is not a present abandonment or relinquishment of a right or claim \r\n  but merely an agreement not to enforce an existing cause of action, and, although \r\n  it may operate as a release between the parties to the agreement, it will not \r\n  release a claim against joint obligors or joint tort-feasors.\" Id. \r\n  (Footnotes omitted). In the case of a release, there is an immediate discharge; \r\n  where as, in the case of a covenant not to sue, there is merely an agreement \r\n  not to prosecute a suit. 66 Am. Jur. 2d Release Â§ 2 (1973). It is nothing \r\n  but a contract and should be so construed. Id.\r\n  \r\nIn Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity \r\n  Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1995), this Court discussed \r\n  the genesis of the covenant not to sue:\r\n  \r\n\"At common law, a valid release of \r\n  one joint tort-feasor was usually a release of all the joint wrongdoers and \r\n  was a bar to a suit against any of them for the same wrong. At the base of this \r\n  rule was the theory that there could be but one compensation for the joint wrong. \r\n  If the injured party was paid by one of the wrongdoers for the injury he had \r\n  suffered, each wrongdoer being responsible for the whole damage, his cause of \r\n  action was satisfied in exchange for a release, and he could not proceed against \r\n  the others. Thus a release of one joint wrongdoer released all. But when the \r\n  consideration received for the release was not full compensation for the injury, \r\n  the purpose for the harsh rule did not exist. To allow for this, the covenant \r\n  not to sue was developed.\"\r\n  \r\nAckerman, 318 S.C. at 146-47, \r\n  456 S.E.2d at 413.\r\n  \r\nC. Covenant Not to \r\n  Execute\r\n  \r\nA covenant not to execute \"is a promise \r\n  not to enforce a right of action or execute a judgment when one had such a right \r\n  at the time of entering into the agreement.\" 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 4 \r\n  (1994). It is merely a contract and not a release. Id. A covenant not \r\n  to execute is distinguishable from a covenant not to sue in that the former \r\n  is normally executed when a settlement occurs after the filing of a lawsuit, \r\n  while the latter is entered into before a lawsuit is filed. Id.\r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina courts have recognized \r\n  the distinctions between a release, a covenant not to sue, and a covenant not \r\n  to execute. In Poston by Poston v. Barnes, 294 S.C. 261, 363 S.E.2d \r\n  888 (1987), the Supreme Court explained:\r\n  \r\nOther jurisdictions hold that a Covenant \r\n  Not To Execute is not a satisfaction or a release and that its legal effect \r\n  is similar to that of a Covenant Not To Sue because it does not operate to release \r\n  other joint tortfeasors. A Covenant Not To Execute is a promise not to enforce \r\n  a right of action or execute a judgment when one had such a right at the time \r\n  of entering into the agreement. A Covenant Not to Sue and a Covenant Not to \r\n  Execute are so closely akin that a major distinguishing factor is that the latter \r\n  is normally executed when a settlement occurs after the filing of a lawsuit, \r\n  while the former is entered into before a lawsuit is filed. In South Carolina \r\n  when a Covenant Not To Sue has been entered into, usually the covenanting tortfeasor \r\n  is no longer a party to the litigation.\r\n  \r\nPoston, 294 S.C. at 263-64, \r\n  363 S.E.2d at 889-90 (citations omitted).\r\n  \r\nThe intention of the parties governs \r\n  in determining whether an instrument is a covenant not to execute or a release. \r\n  Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995). See also Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 482 S.E.2d \r\n  589 (Ct. App. 1997)(to determine whether instrument is covenant not to execute \r\n  or release, this Court looks to intention of parties).\r\n  \r\nII. VALIDITY AND IMPACT \r\n  OF DOCUMENT\r\n  UTILIZED IN CASE SUB JUDICE\r\n  \r\nIn exchange for the payment of $13,000, \r\n  Wade and Pierce executed a document entitled \"Covenant Not To Execute Judgment.\" \r\n  The document acknowledged Wade's damages exceeded the amount of liability insurance \r\n  coverage available to Pierce from his personal insurance carrier. The covenant \r\n  contained the following language:\r\n  \r\n3. That Gerald D. Wade, Jr. and Shirley \r\n  M. Wade do hereby promise and covenant for themselves, their heirs, personal \r\n  representatives, administrators, legal representatives and assigns, not to execute \r\n  against Bobby Joe Pierce or Government Employees Insurance Company, their heirs, \r\n  personal representatives, administrators, legal representatives, successors \r\n  or assigns, on any judgment that may be attained by Gerald D. Wade, Jr. and \r\n  Shirley M. Wade on account of any and all claims, demands, damages, costs or \r\n  expenses, including, but not limited to, any medical or hospital expenses, loss \r\n  of services, actions and causes of action, arising from any act, omission or \r\n  occurrence or resulting or to result from the automobile accident which occurred \r\n  on June 1, 1995, in Berkeley County, South Carolina, when Gerald D. Wade, Jr. \r\n  was involved in a motor vehicle collision with a vehicle driven by Bobby Joe \r\n  Pierce. \r\n4. That, furthermore, Gerald D. Wade, \r\n  Jr. and Shirley M. Wade do further covenant and promise that if they should \r\n  attain a judgment against Bobby Joe Pierce or Government Employees Insurance \r\n  Company, they will not execute on said judgment against Bobby Joe Pierce or \r\n  Government Employees Insurance Company and that, upon a final determination \r\n  of whether any underinsured motorist benefits will be paid, they and their attorney, \r\n  George J. Kefalos, will cause the judgment to be marked and entered as satisfied.\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\n10. That Gerald D. Wade, Jr. and \r\n  Shirley M. Wade, Bobby Joe Pierce and Government Employees Insurance Company \r\n  furthermore agree and understand that this instrument is not intended as a release \r\n  or discharge, nor as an accord and satisfaction with any person whomsoever, \r\n  but only as a Covenant Not to Execute against Bobby Joe Pierce and Government \r\n  Employees Insurance Company, their heirs, personal representatives, administrators, \r\n  legal representatives, successors and assigns, and is executed simply to purchase \r\n  freedom from the threat of execution upon any judgment that may be attained \r\n  against Bobby Joe Pierce or Government Employees Insurance Company including \r\n  any judgment in the lawsuit filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Berkeley \r\n  County, South Carolina, and assigned Case No. 95-CP-08-1281. (Emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nBased upon its language, we conclude \r\n  the document executed by Wade and Pierce was intended to be a covenant not to \r\n  execute as opposed to a settlement agreement, release, or covenant not to sue. \r\n  The document evidences no intent to release others from liability and, in fact, \r\n  contemplates further litigation against other tortfeasors. The instrument recognizes \r\n  Wade was not fully compensated for his injuries. It contemplates Wade's pursuit \r\n  of underinsured motorist coverage. Further, the agreement explicitly states \r\n  it does not operate as a release or discharge. As such, the document is very \r\n  similar to the documents found by the Court to be covenants not to execute in \r\n  the cases of Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 \r\n  S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1995), and Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 482 \r\n  S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n  \r\nWade is still entitled to seek a \r\n  judgment against Pierce and Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). \r\n  He merely agreed not to legally enforce the judgment. In fact, the \r\n  covenant not to execute expressly reserves Wade's right to obtain a judgment \r\n  against Pierce.\r\n  \r\nIII. SOUTH CAROLINA \r\n  TORT CLAIMS ACT-- \r\n  \"SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM UNDER \r\n  THIS CHAPTER\"\r\nThe trial judge concluded Wade's \r\n  covenant not to execute constituted a \"settlement\" under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(d) \r\n  (Supp. 1999). We disagree.\r\n  \r\nSection 15-78-70(d) of the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act provides:\r\n  \r\nA settlement or judgment in an action \r\n  or a settlement of a claim under this chapter constitutes a complete bar to \r\n  any further action by the claimant against an employee or governmental entity \r\n  by reason of the same occurrence.\r\n  \r\nThe original complaint against Pierce \r\n  and John Doe was not a proceeding under the South Carolina Tort Claims \r\n  Act. The lawsuit at this stage had not been initiated under the Act. Section \r\n  15-78-70(c) (Supp. 1999) provides:\r\n  \r\n[A] person, when bringing an action \r\n  against a governmental entity under the provisions of this chapter, shall name \r\n  as a party defendant only the agency or political subdivision for which the \r\n  employee was acting and is not required to name the employee individually, unless \r\n  the agency or political subdivision for which the employee was acting cannot \r\n  be determined at the time the action is instituted.\r\n  \r\nThe gravamen of the entire controversy \r\n  revolves around the determination of the status of Pierce. The statutory language \r\n  \"for which the employee was acting cannot be determined at the time the action \r\n  is instituted\" identifies the conundrum facing Pierce, GEICO, and Wade.\r\n  \r\nA. Statutory Construction\r\n  \r\nWhen construing a statute, the primary \r\n  function of the court is to ascertain the intention of the legislature. See \r\n  Lester v. South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 751 (1999). A statutory provision should be given a reasonable and \r\n  practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the \r\n  statute. Davis v. NationsCredit Financial Servs. Corp., 326 S.C. 83, \r\n  484 S.E.2d 471 (1997). If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and \r\n  conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules \r\n  of statutory interpretation and the Court has no right to look for or impose \r\n  another meaning. Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  16 (1998); City of Columbia v. A.C.L.U. of South Carolina, Inc., 323 \r\n  S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996). Where the terms of a statute are clear, the \r\n  court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning. Paschal \r\n  v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995). The words \r\n  of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting \r\n  to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its scope. Durham v. \r\n  United Companies Financial Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d 465 (1998). \r\n  Where a statute is ambiguous, however, the Court must construe the terms of \r\n  the statute. Lester, supra. Any ambiguity in a statute should \r\n  be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of the law. \r\n  City of Sumter Police Dep't v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. \r\n  371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  \r\nIf the language of an act gives rise \r\n  to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search \r\n  for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself. The Lite House, Inc. \r\n  v. J.C. Roy, Co., 309 S.C. 50, 419 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 1992). Where the \r\n  legislature elects not to define the term in the statute, courts will interpret \r\n  the term in accord with its usual and customary meaning. Adoptive Parents \r\n  v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 446 S.E.2d 404 (1994). In construing \r\n  a statute, the court looks to its language as a whole in light of its manifest \r\n  purpose. Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320 S.C. 213, 464 S.E.2d 109 (1995).\r\n  \r\nB. Covenant Not to \r\n  Execute Did Not Constitute a\r\n  \"settlement of a claim under \r\n  this chapter\"\r\n  \r\nThe phrase \"under this chapter\" in \r\n  Â§ 15-78-70(d) refers to the Tort Claims Act and modifies the prior \"settlement\" \r\n  phrases. Thus, a \"settlement or judgment in an action\" under the Tort Claims \r\n  Act or the \"settlement of a claim\" under the Tort Claims Act \"constitutes a \r\n  complete bar to any further action by the claimant against an employee or governmental \r\n  entity by reason of the same occurrence.\" However, in the instant case, there \r\n  is no \"settlement or judgment in an action or a settlement of a claim\" \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act. The modifier mandates that the settlement or judgment \r\n  activity be \"under this chapter.\" The document executed by Wade is not \r\n  \"under this chapter.\"\r\n  \r\nThe trial judge concluded the covenant \r\n  not to execute constituted a \"settlement\" under Â§ 15-78-70(d) \"since an agreement \r\n  ha[d] been reached between Wade and Pierce which settlement . . . fully resolved \r\n  the matters between Wade and Pierce.\" We disagree.\r\n  \r\nHere, the covenant not to execute \r\n  did not relate to an action or claim under the Tort Claims Act. The covenant \r\n  was not a \"settlement or judgment in an action or a settlement of a claim\" \r\n  under Â§ 15-78-70(d). No claim had been made against the County at the time Pierce's \r\n  personal liability insurance carrier paid $13,000 in exchange for the covenant \r\n  not to execute. The initial complaint alleged causes of action against Pierce \r\n  personally. How can an action against Pierce in his individual capacity \r\n  constitute an action under the Tort Claims Act?\r\n  \r\nThe payment to Wade by Pierce and \r\n  GEICO was effectuated so as to eliminate personal liability of Pierce in his \r\n  status as an individual. If Pierce was not acting within the course and scope \r\n  of his employment, he faced personal liability for damages caused to Wade. The \r\n  County maintains Pierce was not acting within the course and scope of his employment \r\n  at the time of the collision in which Wade was injured. Footnote 2 in the dissent \r\n  avers the allegations in regard to the employment status of Pierce in the complaint \r\n  must be accepted as true because this is a summary judgment motion. We disagree \r\n  with this statement. The instant case is in the unusual posture of having been \r\n  before the Court of Appeals on a prior occasion. In the first appeal, this Court \r\n  ruled: \"The facts of this case create a jury question as to whether Pierce was \r\n  acting within the course and scope of his employment when he collided with Wade. \r\n  . . . [B]ecause a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether \r\n  Pierce was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred, \r\n  the law does not support the trial court's grant of summary judgment to County.\" \r\n  Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, 320-21, 498 S.E.2d 684, 689 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998)(emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nPierce desired protection from his \r\n  vulnerable status if it was decided at a later time that he was not within \r\n  the course and scope of his employment. The document at issue only gave \r\n  Pierce protection as an individual. It never contemplated any impact on the \r\n  issue of his employment status.\r\n  \r\nNeither a \"governmental entity,\" \r\n  as defined in Â§ 15-79-30(d), nor its insurer paid any funds for the covenant. \r\n  Therefore, this case does not present a question of double recovery against \r\n  a governmental entity. Further, the covenant not to execute recognized Wade \r\n  had not been fully compensated for his injuries. The covenant explicitly stated \r\n  it did not operate as a release or discharge. Simplistically put, there was \r\n  no \"settlement of a claim under this chapter.\"\r\n  \r\nThe dissent asserts: \"The majority's \r\n  holding allows a plaintiff to sue an employee of a governmental entity first \r\n  in his or her individual capacity, force the employee into settling the claim \r\n  based on the employee's potential individual liability, and then subsequently \r\n  amend the complaint to add the governmental entity as a defendant.\" Factually, \r\n  this statement is not correct. Here, Wade only added the County after \r\n  Pierce testified in his deposition that he was working on the job. In short, \r\n  under the facts here, to refuse to let Wade end his lawsuit with GEICO would \r\n  force him to go to trial against both parties-even though GEICO wanted \r\n  out. As a matter of judicial policy, it would wreak havoc to adopt \r\n  the position of the dissent. We refuse to countenance the use of a judicial \r\n  straitjacket in this trial scenario.\r\n  \r\nAdditionally, this is not \r\n  an election of remedies issue. Rather, it is an analysis by the Court as to \r\n  whether the covenant not to execute bars Wade's claim against the County. Wade \r\n  did not elect a remedy. In this factual scenario, Wade contractually agreed \r\n  with Pierce (private individual) and Government Employees Insurance Company \r\n  (Pierce's private insurance company) inter sese not to execute on any \r\n  judgment that may be obtained against Pierce as an individual.\r\n  \r\nFinally, in contrariety to the dissent's \r\n  assertion, we do not hold or suggest Pierce and \r\n  the County are joint tortfeasors. Nothing in this opinion is bottomed and premised \r\n  upon the notion that Pierce and the County are joint tortfeasors. There is no \r\n  assumption that Pierce and Berkeley County are joint tortfeasors.\r\n  \r\nFor the sake of clarity, we limit \r\n  the efficacy of this opinion to the unique facts of this case.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nWe hold Â§ 15-78-70(d) does not bar \r\n  Wade's action against the County under the Tort Claims Act. First, the covenant \r\n  not to execute does not constitute a \"settlement of a claim under \r\n  this chapter.\" (Emphasis added). Second, Wade's claim against Pierce was \r\n  not under the Tort Claims Act. It was an action against Pierce as an individual \r\n  facing personal liability in an alleged non-governmental employment status. \r\n  Accordingly, the Circuit Court's order granting summary judgment to the County \r\n  is\r\n  \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR, HUFF, and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\nHEARN, J., concurs in a separate \r\n  opinion, joined by CURETON and STILWELL, JJ.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate \r\n  opinion.\r\nHOWELL, C.J., concurs in the opinion \r\n  of Judge Goolsby.\r\n1. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10, \r\net seq. (Supp. 1999). \r\n2. This case was \r\n  previously before the Court in Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 684 (Ct. App. 1998). In that opinion, this Court concluded Wade was \r\n  not collaterally estopped by a prior Workers' Compensation finding from litigating \r\n  the issue of whether the County employee, Bobby Joe Pierce, was acting within \r\n  the course and scope of his employment when his vehicle collided with Wade's \r\n  vehicle. We ruled a material issue of fact existed concerning Pierce's scope \r\n  of employment and reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor \r\n  of the County. The case is now before us pursuant to a second motion for summary \r\n  judgment on a different ground. \r\n3. We initially \r\n  note there is a question of fact as to whether Pierce was acting within the \r\n  course and scope of his employment with Berkeley County at the time of the accident. \r\n  Wade asserts this factual dispute prevents the grant of summary judgment. If \r\n  Pierce was not acting in the course and scope of his employment, then the County \r\n  would have no vicarious liability under the Tort Claims Act. However, assuming \r\n  Pierce was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the \r\n  accident, the court would still be required to determine the legal issue of \r\n  whether Wade's action against the County was barred based upon Â§ 15-78-70(d). \r\n  Thus, this factual dispute is not material so as to prevent disposition by summary \r\n  judgment.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3146","title":"In the Interest of Robert D.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3146","description":"","date":"2000-04-10","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Interest of Robert D.,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE \r\n  OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Court \r\n  of Appeals\r\n  ________\r\n  \r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n       \r\n        In the Interest of Robert \r\n          D., \r\n        A minor under the age of \r\n            seventeen (17), Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  ________\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nAppeal From Richland \r\n  County\r\n  Donna S.

Giese, all of \r\n        Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n  \r\nHOWARD, J.: The \r\n  family court adjudicated Robert D. delinquent for assault with intent to commit \r\n  criminal sexual conduct. The court committed him to the Department of Juvenile \r\n  Justice for an indefinite term not to exceed his twenty-first birthday. Robert \r\n  D. appeals, arguing the trial court (1) violated his right to confront the witnesses \r\n  against him by allowing the complaining witness to testify via closed-circuit \r\n  television (CCTV); and (2) erred in refusing to hold a Neil v. Biggers(1) \r\n  hearing. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nThe victim is a mentally \r\n  disabled girl who, at the time of the assault, attended high school with Robert \r\n  D. She reported to a physical education teacher and a coach that a boy named \r\n  \"Robert\" sexually assaulted her between classes. She did not know Robert's last \r\n  name, but could describe him and knew that he was friends with two girls in \r\n  her special education class. Based on this information, the coach/school administrator \r\n  investigated her complaint, and concluded Robert D. was the person identified \r\n  by the victim. He brought Robert into his office where the victim positively \r\n  identified him as her attacker. \r\n  \r\nThe solicitor's office \r\n  filed a juvenile petition with the family court charging Robert D. with assault \r\n  with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct. At an adjudicatory hearing, the \r\n  family court allowed the victim to testify via CCTV and refused to hold a Neil \r\n  v. Biggers hearing regarding her pre-trial identification of Robert D. \r\n  \r\nThe victim testified in \r\n  detail about the attack. She also stated that immediately after the assault, \r\n  Robert D. put his hands around her throat and threatened her to keep her from \r\n  telling. This appeal follows Robert D.'s delinquency adjudication and dispositional \r\n  hearing. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nRobert D. first argues \r\n  the family court violated his state and federal constitutional rights to confront \r\n  the witnesses against him by allowing the victim to testify via CCTV. Specifically, \r\n  he argues the court failed to make the factual findings required by Maryland \r\n  v. Craig,(2) in order to determine that the \r\n  special procedure was necessary. (3) \r\n  We find no error.\r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Section 16-3-1550(E) \r\n  requires circuit and family courts to treat certain witnesses, including the \r\n  very young and the handicapped, sensitively. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1550(E) (Supp. \r\n  1999). Our supreme court has held a former version of this statute allows use \r\n  of videotaped testimony, under certain circumstances, without offending the \r\n  defendant's confrontation rights. See State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. \r\n  351, 353 S.E.2d 451 (1987) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1530(G) (1985)). In \r\n  State v. Murrell, our supreme court described the procedure for trial \r\n  courts to follow in permitting a witness to testify via CCTV or videotape:\r\n  \r\nFirst, the trial judge must make \r\n  a case-specific determination of the need for videotaped testimony. In making \r\n  this determination, the trial court should consider the testimony of an expert \r\n  witness, parents or other relatives, other concerned and relevant parties, and \r\n  the child. Second, the court should place the child in as close to a courtroom \r\n  setting as possible. Third, the defendant should be able to see and hear the \r\n  child, should have counsel present both in the courtroom and with him, and communication \r\n  should be available between counsel and appellant.\r\n  \r\nState v. Murrell, 302 S.C. \r\n  77, 80-81, 393 S.E.2d 919, 921 (1990) (footnote omitted). The court noted that \r\n  a trial court's decision to allow testimony via CCTV will only be reversed for \r\n  abuse of discretion in making the decision or in implementing the appropriate \r\n  procedure. Id. at 82, 393 S.E.2d at 922.\r\n  \r\nIn 1990, the United States Supreme \r\n  Court addressed a confrontation clause argument against the use of child testimony \r\n  via CCTV. Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990). The Court ruled that \r\n  a finding of necessity of such procedures must be made on a case by case basis, \r\n  and is proper only if (1) the procedure is necessary to protect the welfare \r\n  of the child witness; (2) the witness would be traumatized, not by the courtroom \r\n  in general, but by the presence of the accused in particular; and (3) the witness's \r\n  emotional distress is more than mere nervousness or reluctance to testify. Id.\r\n  \r\nIn considering the effect of Craig \r\n  on our state guidelines for taped or CCTV testimony, this Court reasoned:\r\n  \r\nCraig did not alter the Murrell \r\n  analysis but instead further amplified its first prong: a trial court's decision \r\n  must be based on the case-specific finding that the use of an alternative procedure \r\n  is necessary to prevent a particular child from the trauma of testifying in \r\n  the defendant's presence. Only then can a state's compelling interest outweigh \r\n  a defendant's Constitutional guarantee of the right to confront the witnesses \r\n  against him.\r\n  \r\nState v. Lewis, 324 S.C. 539, \r\n  545, 478 S.E.2d 861, 864 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  \r\nAs a threshold matter, the State \r\n  argues Robert D. failed to adequately raise this issue to the trial court. We \r\n  disagree. Although he did not specifically mention any constitutional provisions, \r\n  the record reflects Robert D. complained the testimony would violate his right \r\n  of confrontation. Additionally, although he did not mention Craig or \r\n  Lewis by name, Robert D. did argue the court would have to make a specific \r\n  finding of necessity and, for the CCTV testimony to be allowed, the victim's \r\n  fear would have to be of the defendant. Therefore, we find \r\n  the issue is properly preserved for appeal.\r\n  \r\nWe also conclude, however, that the \r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the victim to testify via \r\n  closed circuit television. The court considered testimony from a medical doctor, \r\n  a psychotherapist, the victim, and the victim's mother in support of the State's \r\n  request that the victim testify via CCTV. In addition to having the mental functioning \r\n  of a seven or eight year old, the victim in this case also suffered from a hereditary \r\n  immune system disorder placing her at risk of severe swelling of any body part \r\n  during periods of illness or stress. A medical doctor who treated the victim \r\n  for this disorder testified the victim had previously been hospitalized when \r\n  swelling in her intestines triggered intractable vomiting resulting in dehydration. \r\n  According to the doctor, emotional distress could cause severe swelling in her \r\n  air passages resulting in death by suffocation. The victim's immune system disorder \r\n  further complicates her condition because it sometimes prevents proper absorption \r\n  of medication taken for her seizure disorder. The doctor explained that because \r\n  of the various risks to her life and health the victim \"should take special \r\n  precautions to avoid situations that can be avoidable, particularly those that \r\n  would be severely emotionally stressful.\" \r\n  \r\nThe State also presented substantial \r\n  evidence the victim would suffer emotional distress if forced to testify in \r\n  Robert D.'s presence. Following the assault, she suffered nightmares, anxiety, \r\n  irritability, and aggressiveness. A clinical psychotherapist who counseled the \r\n  victim after the attack opined the victim would not be able to testify fully \r\n  in the defendant's presence because she would be easily upset, scared, and confused. \r\n  The victim testified that although she wanted to testify against Robert D., \r\n  she did not want to testify in his presence because she was afraid of him because \r\n  following the attack, he threatened her. Her mother also testified the victim \r\n  had previously stated she was afraid to see Robert D. \r\n  \r\nThe court articulated case specific \r\n  reasons for the decision, finding the procedure necessary to protect the victim's \r\n  physical and psychological welfare. The court noted the victim would suffer \r\n  more than simple nervousness if made to testify in Robert D.'s presence. It \r\n  is clear from the ruling, when read in the context of the testimony supporting \r\n  the decision, that the court concluded the victim would be traumatized by being \r\n  forced to testify in the defendant's presence. Consequently, we find no abuse \r\n  of discretion.\r\n  \r\nII. Identification \r\n  Hearing\r\n  \r\nRobert D. next argues the family \r\n  court erred by refusing to hold an identification hearing pursuant to Neil \r\n  v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972). We disagree.\r\n  \r\nFirst, Robert D. contends the family \r\n  court erred in concluding that Neil v. Biggers did not apply because \r\n  law enforcement agents did not arrange the out-of-court identification. However, \r\n  we agree with the family court and the courts of other jurisdictions that \"the \r\n  principle expressed in Neil v. Biggers deals with the suggestiveness \r\n  of an identification procedure used by police, and applies only to state action.\" \r\n  Semple v. State, 519 S.E.2d 912 (Ga. 1999); see also United \r\n  States v. Peele, 574 F.2d 489 (9th Cir. 1978). School officials, \r\n  rather than the police, arranged the victim's identification of Robert D. in \r\n  this case. Therefore, Neil v. Biggers does not apply.\r\n  \r\nEven if Neil v. Biggers does \r\n  apply to identifications arranged by persons not connected with law enforcement, \r\n  we also agree with the family court that a hearing was not necessary in this \r\n  case because the victim knew the defendant. The record reflects the victim knew \r\n  Robert D. by his first name, recognized him as a friend of two of her classmates, \r\n  and remembered he watched a couple of films with her class. The victim's teacher \r\n  verified Robert D. watched films with her class and was friendly with the classmates \r\n  the victim mentioned. The rules regarding out-of-court identifications \"are \r\n  designed for application where the accused and the victim are strangers to each \r\n  other; they were never intended to apply where the victim knew the accused. \r\n  The constitutional and procedural safeguards, which the defendant claims were \r\n  necessary, simply do not apply under the facts of this case.\" State v. McLeod, \r\n  260 S.C. 445, 448, 196 S.E.2d 645, 646 (1973).\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nAccordingly, for the reasons discussed \r\n  above, Robert D.'s delinquency adjudication is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n1.  \r\n409 U.S. 188 (1972). \r\n2.  497 U.S. 836 \r\n  (1990).  \r\n3.  \r\n  Although Robert D. challenges the decision to allow the use of CCTV for the \r\n  victim's testimony, he does not challenge the manner in which the family court \r\n  implemented the procedure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3147","title":"Becker v.

The trial court granted, and \r\n  Becker accepted, a remittitur reducing the award to $525,000.00. Both parties \r\n  appeal. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nOn October 12, 1995, Becker was shopping \r\n  in a Wal-Mart store on Hilton Head Island. Becker, seventy-three at the time, \r\n  was pushing a shopping cart down an aisle in the appliance section when a box \r\n  containing a space heater fell from a shelf to her left and struck her left \r\n  foot.(1) Becker immediately experienced numbness \r\n  as a result, and the assistant manager noticed a red mark on her foot. At the \r\n  time, Becker refused medical attention and left the store after completing a \r\n  company incident report. Over the next thirty-six hours, however, Becker's injury \r\n  progressively worsened. On October 14, Becker sought help from her former family \r\n  physician, who referred her to several specialists. In time it was determined \r\n  that Becker had developed \"reflex sympathetic dystrophy,\" or RSD, a painful \r\n  disorder involving the peripheral and sympathetic nerves of the extremity. \r\n  \r\nAs a result of the RSD, Becker endured \r\n  constant, intense pain in her foot over several months, eventually necessitating \r\n  the surgical implantation of an epidural \"portacath\" to obtain relief. She also \r\n  suffered from depression associated with the pain. Becker achieved some improvement, \r\n  however, and finally reached a plateau at which the pain eased to a chronic, \r\n  lower level. One treating physician analogized her discomfort factor as \"sort \r\n  of like having a chronic [foot] fracture that just won't heal, hasn't healed, \r\n  and won't ever heal . . . .\" Becker was ultimately assigned a four per cent \r\n  impairment rating to the lower extremity, which corresponded to a two per cent \r\n  impairment rating to the whole body. \r\n  \r\nOn June 25, 1996, Becker sued Wal-Mart \r\n  Stores, Inc., alleging negligence and seeking both actual and punitive damages. \r\n  At trial, held October 21-22, 1998, the parties stipulated to the admission \r\n  of Becker's medical bills, which totaled $30,538.44. Becker subsequently called \r\n  eight witnesses, including three experts via video deposition. Wal-Mart did \r\n  not present a case. At the close of the evidence, the trial court denied Wal-Mart's \r\n  directed verdict motion, but granted its motion to strike Becker's claim for \r\n  punitive damages. The trial court also denied Becker's motion for a directed \r\n  verdict on the issue of liability only.\r\n  \r\nFollowing the trial court's charge, \r\n  the jury returned a verdict for Becker in the amount of $1,750,000.00. Immediately \r\n  thereafter, Wal-Mart moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new \r\n  trial absolute or, in the alternative, a new trial nisi remittitur. At the trial \r\n  court's request, both parties submitted memoranda supporting their positions.\r\n  \r\nOn January 14, 1999, the trial court \r\n  denied Wal-Mart's post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  and new trial absolute, but granted its motion for new trial nisi remittitur \r\n  and reduced the jury's verdict to $525,000.00. Becker accepted the remittitur \r\n  January 20, 1999. Both parties subsequently filed timely appeals. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nWal-Mart's Appeal\r\n  \r\nI. Directed Verdict \r\n  and Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\r\n  \r\nWal-Mart first argues the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to direct a verdict in its favor. This issue is not preserved \r\n  for our review. \r\n  \r\nThe record reflects Wal-Mart offered \r\n  its motion in the following manner: \"Your honor, for the record, I'd like to \r\n  make a motion for directed verdict.\" Because Wal-Mart failed to specify any \r\n  grounds for the motion, we may not review the trial court's decision to deny \r\n  it.(2) Likewise, the trial court's failure to \r\n  grant Wal-Mart's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is also not \r\n  preserved.(3) \r\n  \r\nII. New Trial Absolute\r\n  \r\nWal-Mart next asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in refusing to grant its motion for a new trial absolute, claiming the \r\n  jury's verdict was based on passion, prejudice, or partiality. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"When a party moves for a new trial \r\n  based on a challenge that the verdict is either excessive or inadequate, the \r\n  trial judge must distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or \r\n  conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice, or prejudice.\"(4) \r\n  The trial court must set aside a verdict only when it is shockingly disproportionate \r\n  to the injuries suffered and thus indicates that passion, caprice, prejudice, \r\n  or other considerations not reflected by the evidence affected the amount awarded.(5) \r\n  In other words, to warrant a new trial absolute, the verdict reached must be \r\n  so \"grossly excessive\" as to clearly indicate the influence of an improper motive \r\n  on the jury.(6) \r\n  \r\nThe decision to grant a new trial \r\n  absolute based on the excessiveness of a verdict rests in the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial court and ordinarily will not be disturbed on appeal. An abuse \r\n  of discretion occurs if the trial court's findings are wholly unsupported by \r\n  the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law.(7) \r\n  In deciding whether to assess error when a new trial motion is denied, the appellate \r\n  court must consider the testimony and reasonable inferences therefrom in the \r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party.(8) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHere, the trial court expressly found \r\n  the jury's award was not grossly excessive, but rather merely excessive. We \r\n  agree. Mere undue liberality on the part of the jury does not warrant an inference \r\n  that the verdict resulted from improper influences.(9) \r\n  Moreover, Wal-Mart admits that \"without question\" Becker sustained an injury \r\n  as a result of the accident. Indeed, Wal-Mart's own brief describes the factual \r\n  circumstances surrounding Becker's injury in sufficient detail to warrant upholding \r\n  the trial court's finding that the evidence presented permitted the jury to \r\n  infer she had incurred substantial damages. Because Wal-Mart fails to identify \r\n  any reason to consider the verdict grossly excessive, the trial court did not \r\n  err in denying a new trial absolute on this ground. \r\n  \r\nWal-Mart further asserts the fact \r\n  that the jury reached its verdict in only about twenty minutes indicates the \r\n  verdict was affected by some improper influence. We disagree. Although tried \r\n  over two days, the case was relatively simple; Wal-Mart did not even put up \r\n  a case. In our view, the evidence presented at trial did not require prolonged \r\n  consideration by the jury, and we will not draw any unwarranted conclusions \r\n  from the brevity of the deliberations.(10) We \r\n  therefore find no abuse of discretion in the denial of a new trial in this case. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecker's Cross-Appeal\r\n  \r\nAlthough she makes several arguments, \r\n  Becker's sole complaint on appeal concerns the trial court's decision to grant \r\n  Wal-Mart's motion for new trial nisi remittitur. \r\n  \r\nInitially, we note that a plaintiff \r\n  who accepts a remittitur in lieu of a new trial is ordinarily bound by that \r\n  election and may not appeal.(11) An exception \r\n  to the general rule, however, permits a plaintiff to cross-appeal the reduction \r\n  in damages when the defendant appeals.(12) Becker's \r\n  appeal on this issue, therefore, is proper. \r\n  \r\n\"The trial court has wide discretionary \r\n  power to reduce the amount of a verdict which in his or her judgment is excessive.\"(13) \r\n  Indeed, when the verdict indicates the jury was unduly liberal in determining \r\n  damages, the trial court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi remittitur.(14) \r\n  This decision will not be disturbed on appeal, therefore, \"unless it clearly \r\n  appears that the exercise of discretion was controlled by a manifest error of \r\n  law.\"(15)\r\n  \r\nIn considering a motion for new trial \r\n  nisi, the trial court must evaluate the adequacy of the verdict in light of \r\n  the evidence presented.(16) In this case, after \r\n  reviewing the evidence, the trial court expressly found the verdict returned \r\n  by the jury was \"merely excessive.\" We agree with this finding. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court granted the remittitur \r\n  based on the amount of Becker's medical expenses, the \"moderate\" nature of the \r\n  diagnosed condition resulting from her injury, her resulting impairment rating \r\n  of four per cent, her age, and her statutory life expectancy.(17) \r\n  Under these circumstances, especially the intangible elements of damages presented \r\n  in this case,(18) we cannot say the trial court \r\n  erred.(19) \r\n  \r\nBecker first argues the trial court \r\n  erred in reducing the jury award because Wal-Mart failed to propose a figure \r\n  for the trial court's consideration. Becker contends the trial court should \r\n  not have granted the remittitur because Wal-Mart failed to suggest an amount \r\n  to be remitted.(20) Because, however, Becker \r\n  did not present this argument to the trial court, either by way of objection \r\n  to Wal-Mart's motion or a separate motion to alter or amend, it cannot be considered \r\n  on appeal.(21) \r\n  \r\nBecker further asserts there were \r\n  no compelling reasons to justify the grant of a remittitur. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nAs Becker correctly notes, compelling \r\n  reasons must accompany the grant of a new trial nisi to justify invading the \r\n  province of the jury.(22) Contrary to Becker's \r\n  assertion, however, the trial court did in fact give specific reasons for its \r\n  decision, namely Becker's pecuniary damages, the nature of her injury, her resulting \r\n  impairment, her age, and her life expectancy. As discussed above, given the \r\n  broad discretion accorded the trial court in such matters, its decision to reduce \r\n  the verdict from $1,750,000.00 to $525,000.00 was not error. \r\n  \r\nFinally, Becker contends the very \r\n  nature of her actual damages claim, i.e., pain and suffering, \r\n  mandates our affirmance of the jury's verdict in toto because a decision on \r\n  such indeterminate damages is inherently within the jury's province. Although \r\n  we agree that a jury's assessment of a plaintiff's pain and suffering is entitled \r\n  to substantial deference,(23) this deference \r\n  does not abrogate the authority of the trial court to grant a new trial nisi \r\n  upon finding \"the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.\"(24) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Daniel v. Sharpe Construction \r\n  Co.,(25) a wrongful death action in which \r\n  the trial court reduced the award to the statutory beneficiaries, the plaintiff \r\n  contended that, because the evidence supported the verdict, the trial court \r\n  erred in granting the defendant's motion for new trial nisi remittitur. The \r\n  supreme court, quoting Lucht v. Youngblood,(26) \r\n  stated:\r\n  \r\nThe reasonableness of the verdict \r\n  was challenged before the trial judge and he reduced it. The fact he heard the \r\n  evidence and was more familiar than we with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial \r\n  gives him, we think, a better informed view than we have. This is particularly \r\n  true when the elements of damage are intangibles and the appraisal depends somewhat \r\n  on an observation of the beneficiaries and evaluation of their testimony.(27)\r\n  \r\nThe statutory beneficiaries in Daniel \r\n  claimed damages for mental shock, wounded feelings, grief, sorrow, loss of companionship, \r\n  and deprivation of the use and comfort of the decedent's society. These losses, \r\n  like pain and suffering, are intangible and nonpecuniary in nature. We therefore \r\n  find the above-quoted language instructive in the present case and hold that, \r\n  notwithstanding the subjectivity necessarily involved in determining a significant \r\n  portion of Becker's damages, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in \r\n  granting Wal-Mart's motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.(28)\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

Yadkin appeals the trial court's directed \r\n    verdict on its claim for diminution in property value and the court's application \r\n    of an offset for settlement amounts Yadkin received from other defendants \r\n    in this action. Eastman cross appeals, alleging the trial court erred in denying \r\n    its motion for a directed verdict on Yadkin's negligence cause of action. \r\n    We affirm.\r\n   FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n    BACKGROUND\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis case arises from a contract \r\n  for the cleanup of a basin at the Eastman plant located in Calhoun County. In \r\n  the early 1990s, Eastman decided to replace its Dowtherm basin, an outdoor concrete \r\n  basin primarily used to recover leaks from failed pump seals. For the last sixteen \r\n  years, a sludge containing grit, sand, fuel oil, Dowtherm, and other materials \r\n  had accumulated at the bottom of the basin. Dowtherm is a heat transfer liquid \r\n  used by Eastman in its production of plastic pellets. It is not considered a \r\n  hazardous material pursuant to the principal federal law and regulations governing \r\n  disposal of this type waste. \r\n  \r\nIn conjunction with the basin's replacement, \r\n  Eastman asked Westinghouse to run analytical laboratory tests on samples taken \r\n  from the basin. A Westinghouse report dated January 8, 1992 indicated that no \r\n  Dowtherm was detected in the samples. \r\nEastman hired Yeargin, Inc., a construction \r\n  company, to solicit bids from specified disposal companies for removal of the \r\n  sludge. Yeargin awarded the contract to Nu-Way Environmental, Inc. Nu-Way, in \r\n  turn, contracted with Soil Remediation Company (SRC), now known as Materials \r\n  Recovery Company, to dispose of the solidified sludge. SRC had a marketing agreement \r\n  with Yadkin and arranged, with Eastman's approval, for the sludge to be delivered \r\n  to Yadkin's property. Yadkin, which possessed permits from North Carolina environmental \r\n  authorities allowing it to incorporate defined proportions of petroleum-contaminated \r\n  soils into its brick-making process, intended to use the sludge for that purpose.\r\n  \r\nOn July 1, 1992, after the removal \r\n  and delivery of Eastman's sludge was underway and Yadkin had received approximately \r\n  850 tons of the material, Yadkin stopped accepting further shipments because \r\n  of the sludge's extremely strong odor. When effluent material began running \r\n  from the sludge and Yadkin was unable to contact Eastman personnel for advice, \r\n  they mixed the sludge with over 3000 tons of other material. On July 6, 1992, \r\n  Yadkin's owner, Jerry Jordan, finally reached personnel at Eastman and was advised \r\n  that Eastman's sludge contained Dowtherm. Yadkin's permits did not include an \r\n  authorization for processing or storing Dowtherm. \r\n  \r\nYadkin's original action was instituted \r\n  in 1992 after the companies involved were unable to come to terms over the removal \r\n  of the contaminated soil. Its current amended complaint was filed in 1997. Yadkin \r\n  alleged several causes of action, including negligence, breach of contract, \r\n  and nuisance, and sought recovery for the cost of cleanup, lost profits,(1) \r\n  and other damages. Yadkin also claimed a diminution in property value because \r\n  of the presence of the Dowtherm-contaminated soil. At the time of trial, the \r\n  brickyard had been sold to a third party. \r\n \r\nBy the time the case went to the \r\n  jury, most of the original parties had settled and only Yadkin and Eastman remained \r\n  in the suit.(2) The jury returned a verdict in \r\n  favor of Yadkin for $255,000 actual damages, assigning thirty-nine percent comparative \r\n  negligence to Yadkin and sixty-one percent to Eastman. The trial court reduced \r\n  the verdict to $155,550 in conformity with the jury's determination of Yadkin's \r\n  comparative negligence. Further, the trial court determined that Eastman was \r\n  entitled to an offset of $351,000 for the amounts Yadkin received in settlement, \r\n  leaving no monies due Yadkin. Both Yadkin and Eastman appeal. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nI. Yadkin's Appeal\r\n1. Directed \r\n  Verdict on Yadkin's Claim for Diminution in Property Value \r\nAt trial, Eastman moved for a directed \r\n  verdict on Yadkin's claim for diminution in property value, arguing Yadkin had \r\n  failed to show a permanent injury to the property. The trial court agreed and \r\n  granted Eastman's motion. Yadkin contends the trial court erred in granting \r\n  the directed verdict in favor of Eastman. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nWhen reviewing a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, a trial court must \"view the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" Swinton Creek Nursery \r\n  v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999). \r\n  A directed verdict is properly granted when the evidence yields only one inference. \r\n  Id. On review, this court may only reverse the trial court if there is \r\n  no evidence to support the trial court's ruling. Id. at 477, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  at 130.\r\n  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, \r\n  \r\n[t]he general rule is that in case \r\n  of an injury of a permanent nature to real property . . . the \r\n  proper measure of damages is the diminution of the market value by reason of \r\n  that injury, or in other words, the difference between the value of the land \r\n  before the injury and its value after the injury. Where the pollution . . . \r\n  results in a temporary or nonpermanent injury to real property, the injured \r\n  landowner can recover the depreciation in the rental or usable value of the \r\n  property caused by the pollution. \r\n  \r\nGray v. Southern Facilities, Inc., \r\n  256 S.C. 558, 569, 183 S.E.2d 438, 443 (1971) (emphasis added); see also \r\n  Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 465, 434 S.E.2d 296, 307 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993) (\"The measure of damages for permanent injury to real property by \r\n  pollution, whether by nuisance, trespass, negligence, or inverse condemnation \r\n  is the diminution in the market value of the property.\") (footnote omitted). \r\n  The amount of damages need not be proved with mathematical certainty. The evidence, \r\n  however, should be such that a court or jury can reasonably determine an appropriate \r\n  amount. Gray, 256 S.C. at 570, 183 S.E.2d at 444. \"Neither the existence, \r\n  causation nor amount of damages can be left to [the judge or jury's] conjecture, \r\n  guess or speculation.\" Id. at 570-71, 183 S.E.2d at 444. Moreover, bald \r\n  allegations are insufficient to establish a claim for diminution in value, and \r\n  the evidence must not be speculative as to the amount of the alleged diminution. \r\n  See  Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 \r\n  S.E.2d 537 (1991).\r\n  \r\nIn support of its argument that it \r\n  presented evidence sufficient to create a jury question, Yadkin cites the discrepancy \r\n  between the estimated value of the property and its sale price. Fred H. Beck, \r\n  a real estate appraiser who had previously provided appraisals for Yadkin when \r\n  the company applied for financing, estimated the value of the property in 1996 \r\n  to be $2,585,000, exclusive of any consideration for the Dowtherm contamination. \r\n  Interestingly, no one indicated to Beck during the loan process that the Dowtherm-contaminated \r\n  soil could impact the value of the property. When asked his opinion during the \r\n  litigation as to the diminution in property value resulting from the presence \r\n  of Dowtherm on the property, Beck stated that such an opinion was beyond his \r\n  expertise. \r\n  \r\nJordan purchased the Yadkin Brickyard \r\n  in 1990 for approximately $850,000 and owned it at the time this incident occurred. \r\n  Jordan testified that he listed the property for sale at $2,800,000, basing \r\n  this figure on the brickyard's productivity, its value as an operating contamination \r\n  reclaiming business, and his knowledge of the brick industry. However, no offers \r\n  were received at that asking price. \r\n  \r\nIn 1996, the brickyard was sold to \r\n  Edward Craig Sasser for $1,800,000, which included $500,000 in inventory and \r\n  a promise that the property would be cleaned up within three years. Thus, the \r\n  sales price attributable to the property itself without the extra inventory \r\n  was $1,300,000. Jordan testified he attributed the difference in price between \r\n  what he believed the property was worth and its ultimate selling price on \"the \r\n  fact that we had been knocked out of the contamination reclaiming business\" \r\n  which was \"vitally important\" to the plant's survival. Although Sasser testified \r\n  Jordan informed him of the contamination and that he took it under consideration \r\n  when negotiating for the property and its cleanup, Sasser's statements fall \r\n  far short of indicating that he purposefully subtracted a certain sum because \r\n  of the Dowtherm on the property and/or the possible loss of use of one holding \r\n  area.\r\n  \r\nMichael T. Stanforth, Yadkin's expert \r\n  witness on remediation and cleanup of petroleum-contaminated soil, testified \r\n  about the remediation of the Dowtherm-contaminated soil. Stanforth estimated \r\n  cleanup costs for removing the soil to be $255,000. Stanforth testified that \r\n  upon taking samples, he discovered free liquids at the base of the stockpile. \r\n  Although he noted that \"there's a possibility of additional migration of the \r\n  Dowtherm down into the clay or the underlying groundwater,\" Stanforth never \r\n  indicated that the property could not be adequately cleaned up or that the contamination \r\n  would result in permanent injury. \r\n  \r\nWe agree with the trial court's conclusion \r\n  that Yadkin failed to present any evidence of a permanent injury to its \r\n  property to warrant submission to the jury of a claim for diminution in property \r\n  value. There was no evidence presented to establish that damage to the property \r\n  would continue to exist once the cleanup was accomplished. \r\n  \r\nYadkin argues, however, a novel theory \r\n  of permanency. Its contention is that since the property was sold during the \r\n  pendency of the action and, according to Yadkin's view, the sales price was \r\n  depressed due to the presence of the Dowtherm-contaminated soil, the damage \r\n  to Yadkin is therefore permanent. This is not, however, the correct analysis. \r\n  Yadkin must prove that the damage is permanent to the property, not just to \r\n  itself. See Gray, 256 S.C. at 569, 183 S.E.2d at 443; Ravan, \r\n  315 S.C. at 465, 434 S.E.2d at 307.\r\n  \r\nThe reasoning of the court in Gray \r\n  would allow for the recovery of personal damages to the landowner when pollution \r\n  only temporarily injures real property. See Gray, 256 S.C. at \r\n  569, 183 S.E.2d at 443. However, at trial Yadkin abandoned any claim for lost \r\n  profits and consented to a directed verdict on this point. \r\n \r\nWe agree with the trial court's decision \r\n  to remove from the jury's consideration any question of permanent damage by \r\n  way of diminution of value of the property from the contamination and instead \r\n  submit only the issue of cleanup costs.\r\n2. Offset for Settlement Amounts \r\nYadkin also argues the trial court \r\n  erred in allowing an offset of the amounts it received in settlement from other \r\n  defendants. \r\n  \r\nAfter the jury's verdict, Eastman's \r\n  counsel moved the court to apply an offset of $351,000--the amount Yadkin received \r\n  in settlement from other defendants. The trial court granted the motion, explaining \r\n  that it would apply a $351,000 offset which would result in the verdict being \r\n  offset in its entirety with no further recovery to Yadkin. Yadkin asserted no \r\n  argument at trial that the offset was improper. Further, when the court asked \r\n  for any post-trial motions, Yadkin's counsel stated, \"I have no motions to make, \r\n  your Honor.\" Finally, Yadkin did not challenge the propriety of the offset by \r\n  means of a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion.\r\n  \r\nBecause Yadkin failed to raise this \r\n  issue below, it is not preserved for our review. See Wilder Corp. \r\n  v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998) (explaining that alleged error \r\n  must be raised to and ruled on by the trial court to be preserved for appellate \r\n  review). Moreover, Yadkin conceded at oral argument that this issue was not \r\n  preserved.  \r\nII. Eastman's Appeal\r\n  \r\nEastman contends the trial court \r\n  erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict on Yadkin's negligence cause \r\n  of action. Yadkin's failure to preserve the issue of set-off and our affirmance \r\n  of Eastman's directed verdict on the diminution in property value results in \r\n  no further monies due Yadkin. Thus Eastman's appeal of the negligence cause \r\n  of action is rendered moot.(3) See Gainey \r\n  v. Gainey, 279 S.C. 68, 69, 301 S.E.2d 763, 764 (1983) (\"This Court will \r\n  not issue advisory opinions on questions for which no meaningful relief can \r\n  be granted.\").\r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n1.  Yadkin consented \r\n  at trial to a directed verdict in favor of Eastman on its lost profits claim. \r\n  \r\n2.  Prior to trial, \r\n  all claims with regard to Yeargin, SCR (and the related entities of Materials \r\n  Recovery Co.), Soil Remediation Corp. (USA), and Foster Dixiana Corp. were settled \r\n  and the parties dismissed. During trial, Yadkin, Nu-Way, and Nu-Way's president, \r\n  Jonathan Rabley, entered into a settlement and were also dismissed as parties. \r\n  \r\n3.  Eastman concedes \r\n  in its brief that its \"cross-appeal may not need to be addressed . . . unless \r\n  the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3149","title":"Scott v.

The jury awarded Lynn Scott, Lance's mother and Personal Representative, \r\n  six hundred thousand dollars in actual damages and 1.5 million dollars in punitive \r\n  damages in the survival action, and 1.5 million dollars in actual damages and \r\n  two million in punitive damages in the wrongful death action. Porter raises \r\n  two issues on appeal: 1) that the verdict should be reversed because of an alleged \r\n  inflammatory closing argument; and 2) that the damages awarded were the result \r\n  of passion, partiality, and prejudice. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nIn December 1992, Lance Scott, then \r\n  fourteen months old, experienced two febrile seizures.(1) \r\n  A CAT scan and EEG performed on Lance revealed no abnormality. After being discharged, \r\n  Lynn took Lance to a follow-up appointment with a neurologist. The neurologist \r\n  examined Lance and concluded he was fine. Lance had no significant medical problems \r\n  until June of 1993.\r\n  \r\nOn the morning of June 2, 1993, Lance \r\n  again had a seizure. Lynn accompanied Lance to Mary Black Hospital in an ambulance. \r\n  At the hospital, Lance became nauseated and threw up several times in the x-ray \r\n  room. Lab tests revealed Lance's serum sodium level was in the low range. In \r\n  contrast to the December seizures, these were not the result of a fever. Finding \r\n  no cause for the seizures, the hospital released Lance and arranged for him \r\n  to see Dr. Porter in her office that afternoon. \r\n  \r\nAt Dr. Porter's office, Lance went \r\n  into another seizure. When the seizure did not appear to be subsiding on its \r\n  own, Porter administered medication to stop it and decided to admit Lance to \r\n  Spartanburg Regional Hospital.\r\n  \r\nAt Spartanburg Regional Lance was \r\n  given an IV of one quarter normal saline at 10 ccs an hour per Porter's orders. \r\n  Spartanburg Regional repeated the same lab work performed earlier in the day \r\n  at Mary Black Hospital. These tests also revealed Lance's sodium level was low. \r\n  However, Porter did not believe Lance's low sodium levels were clinically significant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the IV room at Spartanburg Regional, \r\n  Lance had another seizure. The hospital called Porter who approved an anti-seizure \r\n  drug to be added to Lance's IV. Porter then increased Lance's IV fluid rate \r\n  to 40 ccs an hour. On its own initiative, the nursing staff at the hospital \r\n  placed Lance on an apnea bradycardia (AB) monitor which would alert the staff \r\n  if Lance stopped breathing during a seizure.\r\n  \r\nLance did not have any more seizures \r\n  after approximately 7:00 p.m. However, Lance whined and became restless, pulling \r\n  at his monitors, sheets and bed. Toward morning Lance was combative and unconsolable. \r\n  He fought Lynn when she tried to hold him. At some point Lance stated \"Mommy, \r\n  I no feel good. Hold me.\"\r\n  \r\nLynn summoned the nurses and told \r\n  them she was worried about Lance's behavior and thought he might be on the verge \r\n  of having another seizure. The nurse assured her Lance's behavior was normal. \r\n  When Porter arrived to see Lance around 8:30 a.m., Lance did not seem to recognize \r\n  his mother. Lynn asked if the medicine could be causing Lance's uncharacteristic \r\n  combative behavior. Porter indicated it could and informed Lynn that Lance would \r\n  be sent down for a CAT scan sometime that morning and they would know more after \r\n  that. A student nurse and transport technician later arrived and took Lance \r\n  for an EEG and CAT scan around 9:15 a.m. Before Lance left the room, the nurses \r\n  disconnected his AB monitor.\r\n  \r\nWhile in the CAT scanner, Lance stopped \r\n  breathing. Emergency room pediatrician Dr. Lucy Foxworth ran to the CAT scanner, \r\n  intubated Lance, and put him on a ventilator. Foxworth ordered an arterial blood \r\n  gas test. When it came back, it also listed Lance's sodium level as unusually \r\n  low. Foxworth ordered that the sodium test be repeated to check for an error. \r\n  When the test came back the second time, it showed Lance's sodium level as 120. \r\n  Foxworth ordered a three percent saline solution for Lance and transferred him \r\n  to Greenville Memorial's pediatric intensive care unit. By 3:15 that day, Lance's \r\n  brain had swollen to the point it was too badly damaged for him to survive. \r\n  Lance remained in a coma until his death on June 18. This lawsuit ensued.\r\n  \r\nPlaintiff's expert, Dr. Allen Arieff, \r\n  a specialist in hyponatremia, testifed Lance died as a result of his already \r\n  low blood sodium level being further diluted by the quarter normal sodium IV \r\n  solution. This resulted in water passing into his brain causing it to swell. \r\n  The swelling brain compressed the nerves responsible for breathing. Another \r\n  expert witness offered by the plaintiff, Dr. Duaine Murphee, concurred.\r\n  \r\nArieff stated Porter breached the \r\n  standard of care by failing to monitor Lance's blood sodium level after placing \r\n  him on the dilute IV fluid. He further testified Lance could have been saved \r\n  by simply turning off the IV before he stopped breathing. \r\n  \r\nThe cases were submitted to the jury.(2) \r\n  The jury found Porter negligent and awarded actual and punitive damages against \r\n  her and Foothills Family Medicine Center, P.A. in both cases. After the verdicts, \r\n  Porter moved for a new trial absolute on the ground that the verdict was grossly \r\n  excessive. The court denied the motion. This appeal results.\r\n  \r\nLAW\r\n  \r\nI. CLOSING \r\n  ARGUMENT \r\n  \r\nPorter first argues the verdict should \r\n  be reversed because of an alleged inflammatory closing argument which invited \r\n  jurors to send a message which would put Spartanburg on the map and which \"heaped \r\n  abuse and scorn on defendant and her expert witnesses.\" Specifically, Porter \r\n  refers to the following portions of the closing argument as being abusive:\r\n  \r\nWell I would like to know what the \r\n  jury thinks about the real world because you have seen a real microcosm, a real \r\n  picture here of what the real world is. And I think it comes from the nurses, \r\n  and I think it comes from the experts who have been genuine and honest with \r\n  you. And I think you have seen a sorted (sic) side of that world from another \r\n  contingent of people. I could sit here and contend with you for a very long \r\n  period of time to the many different ways you know you've seen. \r\n  \r\n* * *\r\n  \r\nI don't know if you have ever heard \r\n  about it or not, but there was a story about this particular child molester, \r\n  multiple child molester, (sic) got out of jail and went to this particular neighborhood, \r\n  and the authorities didn't let anyone know that he moved out of jail and into \r\n  this quiet little neighborhood. And he took a girl and he did the same thing \r\n  again. And they call that Megan's Law.\r\n  \r\nThey passed a law as a result of \r\n  that so that all child offenders from then on would have to give their locations, \r\n  and people in the neighboring areas would have to know that the child molester \r\n  was there because who knows what man moves next door to you and has cute little \r\n  bunnies that attract little children or gives them candy or whatever and maybe \r\n  you just think he's nice. If you knew he was a child molester, (sic) you would \r\n  have been told, you wouldn't dare let your child go over there.\r\n  \r\nWell, we will never forget Megan. \r\n  Her life ended, but we will never forget her because of Megan's case, Megan's \r\n  Law. I want to create Lance's Law because of a much bigger reason than just \r\n  those four things. I want to create Lance's Law so that whatever exotic location \r\n  doctors are teaching each other continuing medical education, whether it's Acapulco, \r\n  Miami, or wherever and whatever medical school they are in, every time someone \r\n  on the program will spend thirty minutes to an hour saying, I want to bring \r\n  you up to date on Lance's Law. \r\n  \r\n* * *\r\nLet me turn to this chart. I have \r\n  seen this chart coming all throughout the case and you all have too. Each witness \r\n  that came up - it seems to be significant to Mr. Davis that he can write down \r\n  thousands of children that these people have seen, and they all say they have \r\n  never seen hyponatremia cause cerebral edema in a child. And that's supposed \r\n  to be a big point somehow or another for you all.\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen, isn't the reason \r\n  that that's (sic) the case is because like Dr. Tecklenburg says, (sic) If you \r\n  take a thousand residents with a thousand children who had 131 or 130 sodium \r\n  they're not going to give a quarter normal saline. Yes, very luckily these people \r\n  are not going to see hyponatremia induced by hypotonic dilute solution of quarter \r\n  normal saline because every human who's been to medical school knows not to \r\n  do it.\r\n  \r\nAnd if there are a few fools left \r\n  who would do it, they check it the next morning to see if it's hurt the child, \r\n  and when they find out that it's lowered they stop it. That's it; that's why \r\n  you don't see it. It's kind of like you don't see people with scalpels sticking \r\n  out of their eyeballs coming out of surgery. Doctors don't do that, and that's \r\n  why they haven't seen it.\r\n  \r\nPorter argues that plaintiff's counsel's \r\n  argument \"equated Dr. Porter's treatment of decedent with the actions of a serial \r\n  child molester.\" Porter also interprets the statement by plaintiff's counsel, \r\n  \"And if there are a few fools left who would do it, they check it the next morning \r\n  to see if its hurt the child, and when they find out its lowered it[,] they \r\n  stop it.\" as equating her to a fool. \r\n  \r\nWe initially note Porter failed to \r\n  raise a contemporaneous objection to any of the alleged inflammatory comments. \r\n  The proper course is to immediately object to an improper argument. See \r\n  Moore v. Florence School Dist. No. 1, 314 S.C. 335, 339, 444 S.E.2d 498, \r\n  500 (1994); Hawkins v. Pathology Assoc. of Greenville, 330 S.C. 92, 111, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 395, 406 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\nDespite her failure to object, Porter \r\n  contends this issue was properly raised by post-trial motion. However, it is \r\n  clear from the record that although defense trial counsel mentioned plaintiff's \r\n  counsel's closing argument in his post-trial motion for a new trial, he was \r\n  not actually objecting to the argument itself.(3) \r\n  Moreover, even if we were to find that defense trial counsel raised this issue \r\n  in his post-trial motion, in order to be timely, an objection usually must be \r\n  made at the earliest possible opportunity. Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE; 4 C.J.S. Appeal \r\n  &amp; Error Â§ 214 (1993). Ordinarily, if an appellant fails to object the first \r\n  time a statement is made, he or she waives the right to raise the issue on appeal. \r\n  See State v. Somerset, 276 S.C. 220, 221, 277 S.E.2d 593, 594 \r\n  (1981).\r\n  \r\nPorter nonetheless relies on Dial \r\n  v. Niggel Assoc., Inc., 333 S.C. 253, 509 S.E.2d 269 (1998) and Toyota \r\n  of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 442 S.E.2d 611 (1994) for the \r\n  proposition that the failure to make a contemporaneous objection is excused \r\n  when the challenged argument concerns the abuse of a party or witness. She asserts \r\n  just such a situation occurred in the instant case. However, in reviewing the \r\n  objectionable statements in context, we do not find the use of the word \"sordid\" \r\n  used to describe a \"side of the world\" in any way heaped abuse and scorn on \r\n  Dr. Porter or on her expert witnesses. Additionally, we find counsel's statement \r\n  regarding Megan's law indicates it merely refers to verdicts sending messages.\r\n  \r\nFinally, the statement regarding \r\n  \"fools\", when viewed in the context of the argument, was clearly a reference \r\n  to the standard of care. Furthermore, in Dial our supreme court emphasized \r\n  the narrowness of its holding in Toyota. See Dial, 333 \r\n  S.C. at 257, 509 S.E.2d at 271 (providing in dicta that statement \"[T]hey have \r\n  sewed (sic) deceit, deception, lies and misconception. And they are the ones \r\n  trying to trick you.\" did not rise to the level of a Toyota argument \r\n  when considered in context). Similarly, we hold the allegedly improper statements \r\n  in this case do not rise to the level of those in Toyota.\r\n  \r\nII. DAMAGES\r\n  \r\nPorter secondly argues the verdicts \r\n  were so excessive, they must have resulted from passion, partiality, prejudice, \r\n  and other improper considerations. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nWe preface our analysis of the damage \r\n  awards here with the touchstone that \"[o]ur Supreme Court has repeatedly stated: \r\n  'The proper amounts to be rendered, as actual or punitive damages, are left, \r\n  under our law, almost entirely to the trial jury and the trial judge.'\" Gasque \r\n  v. Heublein, Inc., 281 S.C. 278, 287, 315 S.E.2d 556, 561 (Ct. App. 1984) \r\n  (citing Charles v. Texas Co., 199 S.C. 156, 18 S.E.2d 719, 729 (1942) \r\n  as quoting from Weeks v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 156 S.C. 158, \r\n  153 S.E. 119, 124 (1930)).\r\n  \r\nWrongful Death \r\n  Action\r\n  \r\nDamages recoverable in a wrongful \r\n  death action include: \"(1) Pecuniary loss, (2) mental shock and suffering, (3) \r\n  wounded feelings, (4) grief and sorrow, (5) loss of companionship, and (6) deprivation \r\n  of the use and comfort of the intestate's society, the loss of his experience, \r\n  knowledge, and judgment in managing the affairs of himself and of his beneficiaries \r\n  . . . .\" F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts \r\n  610 (2d ed. 1997) (citing Mishoe v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 186 S.C. \r\n  402, 197 S.E. 97 (1938)).\r\n  \r\nMoreover, South Carolina law provides \r\n  that parents such as Lynn are entitled to a presumption of nonpecuniary damages. \r\n  Mock v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., 227 S.C. 245, 259, 87 S.E.2d 830, \r\n  836 (1955); Self v. Goodrich, 300 S.C. 349, 352, 387 S.E.2d 713, 714-15 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1989); see also Felix &amp; Hubbard, supra, at 615 \r\n  (\"It may often be assumed that grief and sorrow will be experienced at the loss \r\n  of a loved one; however, the strength of such presumption is a function of the \r\n  closeness of the relationship, and in some cases evidence may be \r\n  necessary to support claims of loss.\") (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nIn Self, a mother brought \r\n  a wrongful death action against a physician and hospital for medical negligence \r\n  resulting in the death of her infant son. At the close of her case, the trial \r\n  judge granted a directed verdict for the defendants because the mother failed \r\n  to present any evidence of damages. This court reversed, relying partly on Mock, \r\n  holding the mother was entitled to a presumption of nonpecuniary damages such \r\n  as mental shock, suffering, grief and sorrow, and therefore the issue of damages \r\n  should have gone to the jury. Self, 300 S.C. at 352, 387 S.E.2d at 714-15. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHere, Porter contends there was a \r\n  dearth of evidence on the issue of Lynn's damages. We first note the record \r\n  does not contain a directed verdict motion by Porter based on the insufficiency \r\n  of the evidence. Thus, it does not appear Porter raised this issue during the \r\n  evidentiary portion of the trial. However, even if the issue is preserved, we \r\n  find Lynn was entitled to the presumption discussed by this court in Self, \r\n  thereby making the question of damages one of fact for the jury to determine. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In addition to this presumption, \r\n  the record demonstrates Lynn cared greatly for Lance. Porter testified Lynn \r\n  was a good mother. Nurses' notes indicate Lynn was worried about him. Lynn stayed \r\n  with Lance in his room all night when he was admitted to Spartanburg Regional. \r\n  She summoned the nurses the next morning because of her concern for his condition. \r\n  Lynn witnessed Lance's increasing disorientation to the point he could not recognize \r\n  her. She saw his combativeness and restlessness during the night as his brain \r\n  swelled. She cleaned him up when he vomited. When informed of what happened \r\n  to Lance during the CAT scan, Lynn cried as any caring mother would. \r\nA determination of reasonable compensation \r\n  for nonpecuniary damages turns on the facts of each case and is usually left \r\n  to the jury's discretion. Felix &amp; Hubbard, supra, at 615. We must \r\n  bear in mind this case involves a young, loving mother who lost her infant child. \r\n  There is no mathematical formula which can easily establish the value of this \r\n  kind of loss, and it is not this court's place to do so. See Lucht \r\n  v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, 137, 221 S.E.2d 854, 859 (1976) (Losses to \r\n  parents from the untimely death of a child \"are intangibles, the value of which \r\n  cannot be determined by any fixed yardstick. Their loss to the beneficiaries \r\n  must be estimated by the jury in the exercise of their sound judgment under \r\n  all the facts and circumstances of the case.\"). We find the $1.5 million dollars \r\n  awarded in actual damages is not grossly excessive and was not the product of \r\n  passion or prejudice or other improper considerations. See Knoke \r\n  v. South Carolina Dept. of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, \r\n  142, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996) (affirming $3,000,000 verdict for parents' grief, \r\n  shock, and sense of loss in wrongful death of child) (citing Roberts v. Stevens \r\n  Clinic Hospital, Inc., 345 S.E.2d 791 (W. Va. 1986) (finding $3,000,000 \r\n  appropriate amount for wrongful death of 2Â½ year old child)). \r\nSurvival Action \r\n  (4)\r\n  \r\nUnlike actual damages in a wrongful \r\n  death action, actual damages in a survival action are awarded for the benefit \r\n  of the decedent's estate rather than for the family. See Felix &amp; \r\n  Hubbard, supra, at 622-23 (citing Bennett v. Spartanburg Ry., Gas \r\n  &amp; Elec. Co., 97 S.C. 27, 81 S.E. 189 (1914); Croft v. Hall, 208 \r\n  S.C. 187, 190, 37 S.E.2d 537, 538 (1946)). Appropriate damages in survival actions \r\n  include those for medical, surgical, and hospital bills, conscious pain, suffering, \r\n  and mental distress of the deceased. See Gowan v. Thomas, 237 \r\n  S.C. 223, 225, 116 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1960); Croft, 208 S.C. at 193, 37 \r\n  S.E.2d at 539.\r\n  \r\nThere was no evidence of medical \r\n  or hospital bills other than the $85.00 Porter charged for visiting the hospital \r\n  room and comforting Lynn after Lance stopped breathing during the CAT scan. \r\n  However, there was significant circumstantial evidence of Lance's conscious \r\n  pain and suffering. \r\n  \r\nThe nurses' charts indicate Lance \r\n  was irritable and slept fretfully from midnight until approximately 5:45 a.m. \r\n  He vomited. He became combative, pulling at his monitors and fighting his mother. \r\n  His mother was unable to console him. There is also Lance's own statement, overheard \r\n  by the nurse: \"Mommy, I no feel good. Hold me.\" This is competent evidence of \r\n  the demonstrable suffering Lance experienced before the catastrophic event which \r\n  caused him to stop breathing. Furthermore, Dr. Arieff testified that Lance's \r\n  brain continued to swell until it was forced through a hole in the base of the \r\n  skull, where it squeezed the breathing and heartbeat centers of the brainstem, \r\n  slowing Lance's heart rate, reducing his body temperature to hypothermic levels, \r\n  and eventually stopping his breathing. This is additional evidence from which \r\n  the jury could have inferred pain and suffering which preceded Lance's coma \r\n  and death. See Vereen v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 306 S.C. 423, \r\n  432, 412 S.E.2d 425, 431 (Ct. App. 1991) (stating jury could infer conscious \r\n  pain and suffering from evidence).\r\n \r\n We find the award of damages to \r\n  be in line with such awards in other cases. See New Prospect Drilling \r\n  Co. v. First Commercial Trust, N.A., 966 S.W.2d 233 (Ark. 1998) (affirming \r\n  $1,000,000 conscious pain and suffering award based on testimony of one accident \r\n  witness regarding decedent's condition during period immediately following accident \r\n  before paramedics arrived); Holston v. Sisters of the Third Order of St. \r\n  Francis, 650 N.E.2d 985 (Ill. 1995) (affirming $1,000,000 conscious pain \r\n  and suffering and disfigurement award where evidence would allow jury to infer \r\n  suffering although time period of only several hours elapsed from time when \r\n  fatal medical negligence occurred to when decedent slipped into coma from which \r\n  she did not recover). Therefore, we hold the award of six hundred thousand dollars \r\n  for actual damages was not so excessive as to be a product of prejudice and \r\n  passion. \r\n  \r\nPunitive Damages \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPorter contends the punitive damages \r\n  awards in the wrongful death and survival actions are unsupportable on the record \r\n  and do not meet the Gamble(5) analysis \r\n  for such awards. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nIn South Carolina, \"punitive damages \r\n  are allowed in the interest of society in the nature of punishment and as a \r\n  warning and example to deter the wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses \r\n  in the future.\" Moreover, they serve \"as a vindication of private rights when \r\n  it is proved that such have been wantonly, willfully or maliciously violated. \r\n  Lastly, punitive damages may be awarded only upon a finding of actual damages.\r\n  \r\nGamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. \r\n  104, 110, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991) (citations omitted). \"In order to receive \r\n  an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by clear \r\n  and convincing evidence the defendant's misconduct was willful, wanton, or in \r\n  reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights.\" Lister v. NationsBank of Delaware, \r\n  N.A., 329 S.C. 133, 149, 494 S.E.2d 449, 458 (Ct. App. 1997). The amount \r\n  of punitive damages awarded is largely within the jury's discretion, though \r\n  reviewable by the trial judge. Gamble, 305 S.C. at 112, 406 S.E.2d at \r\n  355. Moreover, the reviewing trial judge is vested with considerable discretion \r\n  over this amount, and our review is limited to correction of errors of law. \r\n  Lister, 329 S.C. at 149, 494 S.E.2d at 458.\r\n  \r\nThe factors enunciated in Gamble \r\n  are:\r\n  \r\n(1) defendant's degree of culpability; \r\n  (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness or concealment; (4) the \r\n  existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant \r\n  or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to \r\n  the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendant's ability to pay; \r\n  and finally, (8) \"other factors\" deemed appropriate. \r\n  \r\n305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at \r\n  354. The trial judge is not required to make findings of fact for each factor \r\n  to uphold a punitive damages award. McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. \r\n  340, 346, 468 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1996). \r\n We \r\nfind the record demonstrates sufficient evidence of Porter's reckless culpability \r\nto support an award of punitive damages. Porter was Lance's admitting physician \r\nand primarily responsible for his care. Porter did not order an AB monitor for \r\nLance, nor did she order follow-up sodium tests which by all plaintiff's experts' \r\naccounts would have saved Lance's life. Dr. Arieff's testimony was that Lance \r\ncould have been saved by simply turning off the IV before he stopped breathing. \r\nIn contrast to Porter's assertion she intended for Lance to go immediately for \r\na CAT scan when informed of his altered mental status, Lance's mother testified \r\nPorter told her Lance would go to the CAT scan \"sometime\" that morning. The totality \r\nof the testimony suggested Porter had a disinterested attitude in the midst of \r\nwhat should have been growing concern for her patient. Clearly this is evidence \r\nPorter recklessly failed to realize the urgency of Lance's condition and failed \r\nto act quickly to save his life and was therefore highly culpable. \r\n \r\nIn examining the record, we find \r\n  the trial judge properly reviewed the punitive damage awards using the Gamble \r\n  factors. The trial judge stated: \r\n  \r\nSpecifically, the Court finds that \r\n  the defendant has the ability to pay, that the defendant's degree of culpability \r\n  was very high, if not 100 percent, that the defendant was aware of her actions. \r\n  There is no evidence of any past conduct, however the Court feels that this \r\n  award of punitive damages is likely to deter others from this type of conduct \r\n  in the future. The Court further finds that the award of punitive damages is \r\n  reasonably related to the injuries suffered in this particular case.\r\n  \r\nWe concur in the trial judge's assessment \r\n  of the punitive damages award. Accordingly, for the above reasons, the judgment \r\n  of the lower court is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nSTILWELL, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concurring.\r\n1.  These are \r\n  seizures due to a fever. \r\n2.  The record \r\n  does not indicate trial counsel for Porter made a motion for directed verdict. \r\n  \r\n3.  Trial counsel \r\n  stated: \"With regard to these damages and with regard to a couple of the comments \r\n  by Mr. Spears, I don't think I said anything about objecting or having objected \r\n  to comments about Meagan's Law. What I am saying, and I hope I made it clear, \r\n  is that the evidence in this case has to do with allegations of medical negligence \r\n  and whether or not that's occurred.\" \r\n\r\n4.  Porter's counsel \r\n  argues in his brief that \"there is nothing in the record to support the Six \r\n  Hundred Thousand Dollars conscious pain and suffering.\"  In \r\n  oral argument before this Court counsel for Porter repeatedly asserted there \r\n  was no evidence in the record to support an award of damages in the survival \r\n  action. If indeed that had been the case, it would have been incumbent upon \r\n  defense counsel to move for a directed verdict on that ground in order to preserve \r\n  the issue for appeal. Thus, we construe counsel's argument to be directed to \r\n  the amount of the damages awarded rather than to the lack of any evidence \r\n  to support an award of actual damages. \r\n5.

Tirado (Wife) for \r\n  monies paid to him as military disability pay. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nHusband and Wife were married in \r\n  December 1968 and divorced in February 1994. At the time of the divorce, Husband \r\n  was retired from the military with a disability rating of 10%, and received \r\n  retirement benefits of $1,157.00 per month. The decree of divorce approved and \r\n  incorporated a settlement between the parties whereby Husband agreed to pay \r\n  Wife one-half of his \"military retirement pay,\" to begin immediately upon sale \r\n  of the marital residence. Pursuant to the agreement, the Defense Finance and \r\n  Accounting Service (DFAS) was to disburse the payments directly to Wife each \r\n  month from Husband's retirement account.(1)\r\n  \r\nFollowing the divorce DFAS commenced \r\n  sending Wife a monthly check for $578.50. Over the next four years, Wife consistently \r\n  received her monthly payments, occasionally realizing slight increases in the \r\n  amount due to cost of living allowances. In early 1998, however, Husband was \r\n  declared 40% disabled, a significant increase from his previous impairment rating \r\n  of 10%. Thereafter, on April 1, DFAS notified Wife that future disbursements \r\n  from Husband's retirement account would decrease in accordance with Husband's \r\n  recently-increased disability status.(2) As a \r\n  result, Wife's DFAS check for the month of April 1998 reflected a reduced payment, \r\n  from $591.98 to $483.48. The next month DFAS again reduced the amount of Wife's \r\n  check to $444.48. \r\n  \r\nWhen Husband refused to reimburse \r\n  Wife for the deductions, Wife filed a complaint seeking a finding of contempt \r\n  against Husband and an order directing him to reimburse her for her portion \r\n  of the diverted retirement funds. Ultimately, the family court issued an order \r\n  refusing to grant the relief requested by Wife. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Military \r\n  Retirement Benefits \r\n  \r\nWife argues the family court erred \r\n  in failing to order Husband to reimburse her for the reduction in her DFAS check \r\n  attributable to Husband's increased disability rating. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nIt is well settled in this state \r\n  that military retirement benefits accrued during marriage are subject to equitable \r\n  apportionment.  See Freeman v. Freeman, 318 S.C. 265, 268, 457 \r\n  S.E.2d 3, 5 (Ct. App. 1995); Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, 383, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  92, 94 (Ct. App. 1996). Here, Husband and Wife entered into a voluntary separation \r\n  agreement which the family court incorporated into the final divorce decree. \r\n  The relevant portion of the agreement states:\r\n  \r\nThe Husband receives military retirement \r\n  pay on a monthly basis. The Husband agrees that one-half (Â½) of this military \r\n  retirement pay should be paid monthly directly to the Wife from the Military \r\n  Retired Pay Center, beginning immediately after the marital residence has been \r\n  sold. . . . The parties to this agreement shall immediately notify the Military \r\n  Retired Pay Center of the sale of the marital residence and therefore of the \r\n  need for the Center to begin making monthly payments of one-half (Â½) of the \r\n  military retirement pay to the Wife. \r\n  \r\nIn Price, this court specifically \r\n  held that a husband may not subvert his agreed-upon settlement obligations to \r\n  his former wife by waiving military retirement pay in favor of disability benefits. \r\n   See Price, 325 S.C. at 383, 480 S.E.2d at 94 (recognizing that \r\n  while the Supreme Court has held a state court may not treat military disability \r\n  benefits as property subject to equitable apportionment, a party cannot use \r\n  this holding \"to undermine [an] [a]greement approved by the [family] court\") \r\n  (discussing Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 594-595 (1989)); cf. \r\n  Fisher v. Fisher, 319 S.C. 500, 505, 462 S.E.2d 303, 305 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (finding husband's unilateral decision to accept voluntary separation incentive \r\n  payments to avoid risking an involuntary discharge before reaching the mandatory \r\n  service requirements for Navy retirement did not bar wife's prior settlement \r\n  claim to 20% of his \"military retirement benefits\"; court stated that a \"husband \r\n  cannot, by his voluntary act of changing the plan under which he will receive \r\n  his post-military service payments, divest [a] wife of her rights\" as contemplated \r\n  under a prior court-approved settlement agreement). \r\n  \r\nHusband contends, and the trial court \r\n  found, that our prior opinion in Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  92 (Ct. App. 1996), is distinguishable. We agree. \r\n  \r\nThere are important distinctions \r\n  between the facts of this case and those presented in Price. In Price, \r\n  the agreement stated the wife would receive 34% of the husband's \"gross monthly \r\n  military retirement pay\" whereas here, the agreement afforded Wife one-half \r\n  of Husband's \"military retirement pay.\" Thus, the court in Price noted \r\n  that although the agreement therein did not define \"gross monthly military retirement \r\n  pay,\" the record indicated that the parties calculated the amount owed using \r\n  a figure that included disability pay. The opinion further stated: \"Given the \r\n  fact that Husband agreed, after Mansell, to pay Wife a percentage of \r\n  his gross monthly military retirement pay, which included disability pay, he \r\n  should not be permitted to complain that the family court erred in enforcing \r\n  the terms of the agreement.\" Price, 325 S.C. at 383, 480 S.E.2d at 94. \r\n  This is not the case here where, at the time the parties reached their agreement, \r\n  Husband was receiving 10% of his gross monthly retirement pay in the form of \r\n  disability benefits and this portion was excluded from the Wife's 50% \r\n  share. Furthermore, unlike in Price where the husband directly paid the \r\n  wife her share of the retirement benefits, here DFAS made the payments to Wife. \r\n  Thus, we hold that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in \r\n  Price and that under Mansell, Wife is not entitled to any portion \r\n  of Husband's increased disability pay.\r\n  \r\nII. Contempt\r\n  \r\nWife further contends the family \r\n  court erred in failing to find Husband in contempt. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nContempt is a consequence of the \r\n  willful disobedience of a court order. See Henderson v. Henderson, \r\n  298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989); American Fed. Bank, FSB v. \r\n  Kateman, 335 S.C. 273, 276, 516 S.E.2d 1, 2 (Ct. App. 1999). A willful act \r\n  is one \"done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent . . . to \r\n  fail to do something the law requires to be done . . . .\" Spartanburg County \r\n  Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 \r\n  (1988) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)). \r\n  A finding of contempt, therefore, must be reflected in a record that is \"clear \r\n  and specific as to the acts or conduct upon which such finding is based.\" Curlee \r\n  v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982). \r\n  \r\nA decision on contempt rests within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and is subject to reversal only for \r\n  abuse or where the decision is based on a finding that is without evidentiary \r\n  support. Padgett, 296 S.C. at 83, 370 S.E.2d at 875; Kateman, \r\n  335 S.C. at 278, 516 S.E.2d at 3. Here, the family court found Husband was not \r\n  in contempt of court. We agree, as the record contains no court order upon which \r\n  to base a contempt finding. Not only had no court previously ordered Husband \r\n  to reimburse Wife for the deductions, the divorce agreement itself charged DFAS, \r\n  not Husband, with the responsibility of making the payments to Wife.\r\n  \r\nMoreover, in our view the record \r\n  presents no evidence indicating Husband intentionally claimed increased disability \r\n  in order to prevent Wife from receiving her share of his military retirement \r\n  benefits. See Price, 325 S.C. at 383, 480 S.E.2d at 94 (reversing \r\n  family court's finding of contempt on similar facts). In the absence of such \r\n  evidence or a prior court order directing Husband to reimburse Wife, the family \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in declining to find Husband in contempt. \r\n  See Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, \r\n  487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997) (\"An abuse of discretion occurs when there is an \r\n  error of law or a factual conclusion which is without evidentiary support.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII. Attorney Fees\r\n  \r\nIn the conclusion to her brief, Wife \r\n  requests reasonable attorney fees and costs. The question of attorney fees is \r\n  not preserved for our review. See Rule 207(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, \r\n  no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of issues \r\n  on appeal.\"); Gamble v. International Paper Realty Corp. of South Carolina, \r\n  323 S.C. 367 n.1, 474 S.E.2d 438 n.1 (1996) (same); First Sav. Bank v. McLean, \r\n  314 S.C. 361,363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (issues not argued or supported \r\n  by authority are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal). Moreover, \r\n  in light of our disposition of the merits of this appeal, attorney fees would \r\n  not be warranted. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court judge is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nSTILWELL and SHULER, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n  \r\n1.  The parties' \r\n  agreement erroneously referred to DFAS as the \"Military Retired Pay Center.\" \r\n  \r\n2.  Veterans receiving \r\n  retirement pay may apply for disability benefits if they are rendered disabled \r\n  as a result of military service. However, \"[i]n order to prevent double dipping, \r\n  a military retiree may receive disability benefits only to the extent that he \r\n  waives a corresponding amount of his military retirement pay.\" Mansell v. \r\n  Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 583 (1989). Since disability benefits are exempt \r\n  from federal, state, and local taxes, military retirees prefer, when possible, \r\n  to waive retirement pay in favor of disability benefits in order to increase \r\n  their after-tax income. Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, 383, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  92, 94 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Mansell, 490 U.S. at 583-584). Accordingly, \r\n  because DFAS calculates Wife's one-half share of Husband's retirement pay and \r\n  sends it directly to her, Husband's post-divorce waiver of retirement pay in \r\n  favor of increased disability benefits resulted in an automatic, corresponding \r\n  reduction in Wife's DFAS check. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3151","title":"State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v.

Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, 383, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  92, 94 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Mansell, 490 U.S. at 583-584). Accordingly, \r\n  because DFAS calculates Wife's one-half share of Husband's retirement pay and \r\n  sends it directly to her, Husband's post-divorce waiver of retirement pay in \r\n  favor of increased disability benefits resulted in an automatic, corresponding \r\n  reduction in Wife's DFAS check. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3152","title":"Larimore v.

Larimore brought this action against Carolina Power &amp; Light (CP&amp;L) \r\n  and Thad Williams for injuries he received when installing vinyl siding at Williams' \r\n  home. Larimore appeals the trial court's reduction of the verdict for his comparative \r\n  negligence, the grant of a directed verdict to Williams, and the court's failure \r\n  to give a proposed jury charge. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nWilliams hired Larimore to add vinyl \r\n  siding to his new home that was under construction. Larimore was instructed \r\n  to add vinyl siding primarily under the porches and around the eaves, gables, \r\n  and vents of the home. He began work at the site on or about April 16, 1992.\r\n  \r\nOn April 16, 1992, CP&amp;L employees \r\n  arrived to install underground utility lines to the home to provide it with \r\n  electricity. CP&amp;L dug a trench from the road across the property to the \r\n  meter in order to bury the underground cables. The trench was 150 feet long, \r\n  2 to 3 feet deep, and 6 inches wide. Larimore was at the site when CP&amp;L \r\n  dug the trench and was aware of its presence.\r\n  \r\nAfter laying the underground electrical \r\n  lines, CP&amp;L employees refilled the trench with soil, and attempted to pack \r\n  it down using a \"ditch witch\" that had been used to dig the trench. According \r\n  to the specifications and procedures followed by CP&amp;L, a mechanical tamp \r\n  should have been used to compact the soil into the excavated area to prevent \r\n  settling of the soil over time. \r\n  \r\nDecimus Barbot, Larimore's expert \r\n  witness, testified the ditch witch was not designed to compact soil and actually \r\n  compacted only the top few inches of the trench. He further testified the ditch \r\n  witch does not generate enough pressure to compact soil and, in this case, where \r\n  the trench was only 6 inches across and the wheel base of the ditch witch was \r\n  12 inches wide, no pressure could really be applied to the trench itself. By \r\n  using the ditch witch instead of a mechanical tamp to compact the trench, the \r\n  soil was subject to settling.\r\n  \r\nSeveral days after CP&amp;L dug the \r\n  trench, including the morning of April 20, 1992, it rained. The soil covering \r\n  the trench settled several inches, forming a crust over the top of the trench, \r\n  while the earth underneath settled even more. Larimore noticed it had rained \r\n  enough to form puddles on the property.\r\n  \r\nOn April 20, 1992, Larimore was standing \r\n  about 8 to 10 feet from Williams' home as he walked around inspecting the gables. \r\n  According to Larimore, he stepped on the dirt covering the trench as he was \r\n  looking up at the gables. The trench caved in and fractured his right hip.\r\n  \r\nLarimore filed this action against \r\n  CP&amp;L and Williams seeking damages for his injuries. At trial, Williams moved \r\n  for a directed verdict, asserting he did not have knowledge of a problem on \r\n  the site which would pose a danger to the subcontractors. Williams asserted \r\n  he was not responsible for warning Larimore of an open and obvious condition. \r\n  The trial court granted Williams' motion for a directed verdict, and the matter \r\n  proceeded with CP&amp;L as the remaining defendant.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of Larimore but found that he was 50 per cent negligent. The jury also awarded \r\n  Larimore $5,000 in punitive damages.\r\n  \r\nI. Reduction of Verdict for \r\n  Larimore's Comparative Negligence\r\n  \r\nLarimore contends once the jury determined \r\n  CP&amp;L's conduct was reckless, willful, or wanton, it should not have been \r\n  compared with his simple negligence.\r\n  \r\nThe trial court instructed the jury \r\n  that it could award punitive damages to Larimore if it found CP&amp;L had committed \r\n  \"wanton, willful, malicious, or conscious wrongdoing.\"\r\n  \r\nAfter the jury returned its verdict \r\n  of actual and punitive damages and found Larimore 50 per cent comparatively \r\n  negligent, a discussion ensued among the trial court and counsel for both parties \r\n  as to the proper method for calculating the reduction for Larimore's comparative \r\n  negligence. At issue was whether to reduce just the actual damages or both the \r\n  actual and punitive damages by 50 per cent. Larimore's counsel stated he did \r\n  not believe Larimore's negligence should have any effect as far as the punitive \r\n  damages award. No other objection or issue was raised concerning the jury's \r\n  verdict. The trial court subsequently entered a written judgment which reduced \r\n  Larimore's actual damages of $25,898.34 by 50 per cent to $12,949.17, and awarded \r\n  him the full amount of punitive damages, $5,000, for a total judgment of $17,949.17. \r\n  There is no Rule 59, SCRCP motion challenging the calculation of the judgment \r\n  in the record on appeal.\r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Larimore contends that \r\n  because the jury awarded him punitive damages, in effect finding CP&amp;L was \r\n  reckless, willful, or wanton, no portion of the jury's verdict should be reduced \r\n  for his simple negligence under the comparative negligence doctrine. This issue \r\n  was not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court. Accordingly, it is not \r\n  properly before this court for review.(1)\r\n  \r\nII. Directed Verdict as to \r\n  Thad Williams\r\n  \r\nLarimore next argues the trial court \r\n  erred in granting a directed verdict to Williams. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nThe trial court may properly grant \r\n  a motion for a directed verdict where only one reasonable inference can be drawn \r\n  from the evidence.(2) In deciding a motion for \r\n  a directed verdict, all inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party.(3) \r\nWilliams, as the property owner, \r\n  owes a duty to those on his property commensurate with their status.(4) \r\n  South Carolina recognizes four classes of persons present on the property of \r\n  another: adult trespassers, invitees, licensees, and children.(5) \r\n  The level of care owed is dependent upon the class of the person present.(6) \r\n  Because Larimore was a business visitor invited to enter or remain on the property \r\n  for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with Williams, Larimore was an \r\n  invitee.(7)\r\n  \r\n\"The owner of property owes to an \r\n  invitee or business visitor the duty of exercising reasonable or ordinary care \r\n  for his safety, and is liable for injuries resulting from the breach of such \r\n  duty.\"(8) The landowner has a duty to warn an \r\n  invitee only of latent or hidden dangers of which the landowner has knowledge \r\n  or should have knowledge.(9) The degree of care \r\n  required is commensurate with the particular circumstances involved, including \r\n  the age and capacity of the invitee.(10) \r\n  \r\nIn moving for a directed verdict, \r\n  Williams argued that the trench was an open and obvious condition on the property \r\n  and, as such, Williams owed no duty to warn Larimore of the condition. The trial \r\n  court agreed and directed a verdict in Williams' favor. Larimore does not appeal \r\n  the trial court's ruling that the danger was open and obvious; hence, it is \r\n  the law of the case.(11) \r\n  \r\nA landowner generally does not owe \r\n  a duty to warn others of open and obvious conditions on the property.(12) \r\n  Our supreme court, however, held in Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp.(13) \r\n  that a landowner may still be liable for injuries suffered from an open and \r\n  obvious defect if the landowner should have anticipated the harm.(14) \r\n  \r\nLarimore argues the rule in Callander \r\n  requires submission of Williams' liability to the jury in his case. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Callander, an elderly customer \r\n  fell when he visited a crowded Krispy Kreme store in Charleston and backed up \r\n  to sit on a stool that lacked a rounded seat cushion. Our supreme court adopted \r\n  the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 343 A, which states:\r\n  \r\n(1) A possessor of land is not liable \r\n  to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition \r\n  on the land whose danger is known or obvious to them, unless the possessor should \r\n  anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.(15) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe believe Callander is inapposite \r\n  here. In Callander, the owner admitted knowing of the condition for over \r\n  two months and had in fact placed a sign on the broken stool warning customers \r\n  of the condition. At the time of the accident, however, the sign was missing \r\n  and had not been replaced. Moreover, the restaurant, open to the public at large, \r\n  was often crowded and often visited by senior citizens who frequently backed \r\n  onto the stools in order to sit down. Based on the owner's knowledge of the \r\n  defect, the length of time the defect existed, the owner's previous warning \r\n  to the patrons of the danger, the restaurant's frequent visitation by senior \r\n  citizens, and the owner's knowledge that his customers frequently backed onto \r\n  the stools, the supreme court concluded that a jury question existed as to whether \r\n  the harm should have been anticipated by the owner.\r\n  \r\nIn contrast to Callander, \r\n  Williams had no knowledge of the defect. Despite the fact the defect was open \r\n  and obvious to those on the construction site, Larimore failed to present any \r\n  evidence that Williams had any knowledge of the defect's existence prior to \r\n  the accident. Because Williams had no knowledge of the defect's existence, it \r\n  would be impossible for him to anticipate any harm that might result from it. \r\n  We do not read section 343A of the Restatement to require landowners to anticipate \r\n  harm from an open and obvious condition from the moment of the condition's creation. \r\n  To impose liability under such a theory would make landowners insurers of their \r\n  invitees' safety; it is well-established in South Carolina that they are not.(16)\r\n  \r\nFurthermore, as previously noted, \r\n  the degree of care required by a landowner is commensurate with the particular \r\n  circumstances involved, including the age and capacity of the invitee. In the \r\n  present case, Larimore was an experienced contractor familiar with construction \r\n  sites and the way they operated. He testified he usually conducted a visual \r\n  inspection of the construction site for the safety and protection of his own \r\n  employees. Additionally, Larimore knew of the trench's existence and location, \r\n  as he was present the day CP&amp;L dug the trench and placed the electrical \r\n  lines. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that there is no basis to \r\n  hold Williams liable as a landowner under this situation.\r\n  \r\nLarimore also claims Williams, acting \r\n  as a general contractor, is liable under the theory of premises liability. In \r\n  his brief, Larimore does not, however, argue any other potential theory of liability \r\n  for a general contractor.(17)\r\n  \r\nUnder a premises liability theory, \r\n  a contractor generally equates to an invitor and assumes the same duties \r\n  that the landowner has, including the duty to warn of dangers or defects known \r\n  to him but unknown to others.(18) A general \r\n  contractor, however, \r\n  \r\nis not liable to an invitee for an \r\n  injury resulting from a danger that was obvious or that should have been observed \r\n  in the exercise of reasonable care. The entire basis of an invitor's liability \r\n  rests upon his superior knowledge of the danger that causes the invitee's injuries. \r\n  If that superior knowledge is lacking, as when the danger is obvious, the invitor \r\n  cannot be held liable.(19) \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, Williams, in both his \r\n  role as landowner and general contractor, owed no duty to warn Larimore of the \r\n  open and obvious defect.\r\n  \r\nIII. Failure to Give Proposed \r\n  Charge\r\n  \r\nLarimore contends the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to charge his proposed Jury Charge No. 24, which states:\r\n  \r\nOur courts have established a high \r\n  degree of care for the utility companies in maintaining wire lines. When utility \r\n  companies maintain wire lines on or over private premises, they are required \r\n  to use care commensurate with the danger to see that no injury comes to persons \r\n  rightfully in proximity to them and who are guilty of no wrong.\r\n  \r\nThe care required is more than mere \r\n  mechanical skill; it includes foresight with regard to reasonably probable contingencies. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court declined to give \r\n  the proposed charge, stating, \"I think twenty-four would be of a maintenance \r\n  and not installation. I think we are talking about installation and not maintenance \r\n  in this case.\"\r\n  \r\nWhen instructing the jury, the trial \r\n  judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.(20) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"To warrant reversal for refusal \r\n  to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have not only been erroneous, \r\n  but prejudicial as well. Refusal to give a properly requested charge is not \r\n  error if the general instructions are sufficiently broad to enable the jury \r\n  to understand the law and the issues involved.\"(21) \r\n  \r\nWe find no reversible error in the \r\n  trial court's failure to give the proposed instruction under the circumstances \r\n  present here. At issue was not CP&amp;L's duty to maintain power lines, but \r\n  the proper procedure for their installation. Further, the charge primarily concerns \r\n  the maintenance of overhead lines as opposed to underground lines. Upon reviewing \r\n  the trial court's charge as a whole, we discern no prejudice to Larimore. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n1.  Tupper \r\n  v.

(1999) (FHA). \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nIn July 1995, Jay Spateholts incorporated \r\n  Sleepy Hollow Youth, Inc. (Sleepy Hollow) as a private non-profit corporation. \r\n  Sleepy Hollow planned to operate a home for six to eight emotionally disabled \r\n  children. While applying for a license from the South Carolina Department of \r\n  Social Services (SCDSS) and approval as a Medicaid provider from the Health \r\n  and Human Services Finance Committee, Sleepy Hollow initiated a search for an \r\n  appropriate site. In January 1996, Sleepy Hollow leased a house with an option \r\n  to purchase on Johns Island in Charleston County.\r\nA number of residents on Johns Island \r\n  opposed Sleepy Hollow's intended use of the property. The residents wrote letters \r\n  to SCDSS expressing their opposition to the group home in an attempt to persuade \r\n  SCDSS to deny Sleepy Hollow's license for the home. Initially, SCDSS denied \r\n  Sleepy Hollow's application. However, upon further review, SCDSS granted the \r\n  license. \r\n  \r\nIn addition, the residents contacted \r\n  the building inspectors incorrectly asserting Sleepy Hollow was engaging in \r\n  construction without a building permit. These residents then contacted a business \r\n  licensing official complaining Sleepy Hollow was operating a business without \r\n  a license even though Sleepy Hollow was only preparing the site and was not \r\n  yet operational. Eventually, one resident expressed his concerns to the County \r\n  of Charleston (the County).\r\n  \r\nOn February 12, 1996, Nancy Bloodgood, \r\n  an attorney for the County, called Spateholts requesting a letter explaining \r\n  Sleepy Hollow's purpose and intentions. Spateholts responded that day. Three \r\n  days later he attended a meeting of the County's finance committee. At that \r\n  meeting, a lawyer for the residents presented their objections to County Council. \r\n  The committee did not recognize Spateholts and would not allow him to speak \r\n  at this meeting. \r\n  \r\nCounty Council met on February 20, \r\n  1996. The objecting residents, Spateholts, and the respective attorneys were \r\n  present at the meeting. Both sides were allowed to present their positions. \r\n  County Council decided to object to the proposed group home site invoking the \r\n  procedure outlined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-770 (Supp. 1999). The stated basis \r\n  for the objection was the \"concerns expressed by members of the community.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSection 6-29-770 states that when \r\n  a local government objects to a proposed site for a group home, representatives \r\n  from the entity seeking to establish the group home and the governmental entity \r\n  appoint a third mutually agreeable person, and those three persons then have \r\n  forty-five days to find an alternate site for the group home. The final selection \r\n  is determined by a majority vote and is binding on the group home and the governing \r\n  body. If no alternate site is selected, the entity establishing the home selects \r\n  the site without further proceedings. \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the County nominated \r\n  William Dean, one of the residents who opposed the group home, as its representative. \r\n  Dean and Spateholts, who was Sleepy Hollow's designated representative, could \r\n  not agree on the third member of the committee. \r\n  \r\nSleepy Hollow began operating in \r\n  July 1996. On September 24, 1996, the County brought this action seeking Sleepy \r\n  Hollow's compliance with the statute. (1) The \r\n  County requested an order temporarily enjoining Sleepy Hollow from operating \r\n  the group home until it complied with the statutory requirements. At the hearing \r\n  on the County's motion for a temporary injunction, Sleepy Hollow agreed to participate \r\n  in the site selection process with a different representative from the County. \r\n  The court ordered the County to appoint a new representative and found that \r\n  five days would be a reasonable time for the representatives to select the third \r\n  member of the committee. The court directed the parties to act in good faith \r\n  in selecting the third person within this time. \r\n  \r\nThe County designated Edward Bryant \r\n  as its replacement representative. Spateholts found Bryant unacceptable because \r\n  Bryant and his wife had written a letter to SCDSS opposing the group home. Sleepy \r\n  Hollow answered the County's complaint and asserted various counterclaims, including \r\n  allegations that the County's actions violated the FHA and that Sleepy Hollow \r\n  was entitled to actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees from the \r\n  violation. \r\n  \r\nThe County moved for summary judgment \r\n  asserting Sleepy Hollow's first eight counterclaims were moot because Sleepy \r\n  Hollow had voluntarily abandoned the site. In addition, the County asserted \r\n  Sleepy Hollow's remaining claim for damages and attorneys fees failed because \r\n  there was no evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the County \r\n  engaged in conduct violating the FHA. Sleepy Hollow agreed the County's claim \r\n  and its own first eight counterclaims were moot because Sleepy Hollow ceased \r\n  operation of the group home on Johns Island, but maintained its counterclaim \r\n  for damages remained viable and presented issues for trial. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court found Sleepy Hollow \r\n  failed to allege or prove any discriminatory motive or act on the part of the \r\n  County and, thus, failed to establish a prima facie case of violation of the \r\n  FHA. The trial court held that the County complied with state law, which is \r\n  presumed constitutional and which Sleepy Hollow had not alleged to be unconstitutional. \r\n  Therefore, the actions taken by the County, taken alone, were not discriminatory. \r\n  Accordingly, it granted the County's motion for summary judgment. \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Summer \r\n  v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997); Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP. \"Summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts \r\n  of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.\" Tupper \r\n  v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 87, 191 (1997). Even \r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions \r\n  or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Id. \r\n  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must \r\n  be construed most strongly against the movant. True \r\n  v. Monteith, 327 S.C. 116, 489 S.E.2d 615 (1997).\r\n  \r\nThe party seeking summary judgment \r\n  has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact. Baughman v. American Tel. and \r\n  Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991). Summary judgment is a \r\n  drastic remedy and should be cautiously invoked so no person will be improperly \r\n  deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues. Id.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nAs amended in 1988, the Fair Housing \r\n  Act (FHA) protects people with disabilities against discrimination in housing. \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§ 3601 et seq. (1999). \r\n  Normally, the threshold question facing a court is whether or not the individuals \r\n  are \"handicapped\" within the meaning of the FHA, and thus whether or not they \r\n  are protected under the Act. The only named appellant in the present case is \r\n  Sleepy Hollow, the sponsor of the group home. Therefore, the threshold question \r\n  becomes whether Sleepy Hollow has standing to bring the present action.\r\n  \r\nThe FHA prohibits housing discrimination \r\n  not only where handicapped persons seek to buy or lease a dwelling themselves, \r\n  but also where they intend to reside in the dwelling after it is bought or rented \r\n  by another, or where they are \"associated\" with the buyer or renter. See \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§ 3604(f)(1) (1999). Federal courts have held that a person who is \r\n  not himself handicapped, but who is prevented from providing housing for handicapped \r\n  persons, has standing to sue under the FHA. See, \r\n  e.g., Judy B. v. Borough of \r\n  Tioga, 889 F. Supp. 792 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (citing \r\n  Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, \r\n  455 U.S. 363 (1982)). Therefore, group home sponsors, such as Sleepy Hollow, \r\n  have standing to bring FHA claims, though they are not themselves \"handicapped.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court recognizes legislators \r\n  and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous competing \r\n  considerations and thus, we will normally refrain from reviewing the merits \r\n  of their decisions, absent evidence of arbitrariness or irrationality. However, \r\n  discrimination is not just another competing consideration. \"When there is a \r\n  proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, \r\n  this judicial deference is no longer justified.\" Village \r\n  of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, \r\n  265-66 (1977).\r\n  \r\nThe County may apply non-discriminatory \r\n  land use considerations, such as traffic or parking concerns, when determining \r\n  whether to object to a proposed group home site. However, South Carolina Code \r\n  Â§ 6-29-770 provides local governments with no guidance or criteria regarding \r\n  when they may invoke this procedure. In the present case, the County never articulated \r\n  any zoning or land use rationale for its opposition to the group home site. \r\n  Instead, the County, by its own admission, based its decision solely on the \r\n  concerns expressed by the community. Therefore, we are obligated to examine \r\n  the County's decision in order to ensure that the statute was not haphazardly \r\n  applied and to determine what factors truly led to the County's objection.\r\n  \r\nThe majority of courts applying the \r\n  FHA have concluded that a cause of action under the Act against a local government \r\n  may arise under any one of three theories. First, a plaintiff may allege that \r\n  the local government's decision was based on intentional discrimination against \r\n  the disabled, otherwise known as \"discriminatory intent\" or \"disparate treatment.\" \r\n  Bangerter v. Orem City Corp., \r\n  46 F.3d 1491 (10th Cir. 1995). Second, a facially neutral regulation, \r\n  practice or policy may violate the FHA if it has a \"disparate impact\" or \"discriminatory \r\n  effect\" upon people with disabilities. See \r\n  Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 \r\n  F.2d 1055 (4th Cir. 1982). Lastly, a local government's failure to \r\n  make a reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities may give rise to \r\n  a cause of action under the FHA. 42 U.S.C. Â§ 3604(f)(3)(B) (1999). Since appellant \r\n  alleges facially discriminatory actions and not the effects of facially neutral \r\n  actions, we conclude that appellant's claim is one of disparate treatment and \r\n  not disparate impact.\r\n  \r\nSleepy Hollow may show disparate \r\n  treatment by proving that the County would not have objected to the proposed \r\n  site but for discriminatory animus toward the handicapped. Sleepy Hollow must \r\n  show that this \"discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\" in the County's \r\n  decision to object to the site. See \r\n  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \r\n  at 270.\r\n  \r\nIn order to prove intentional discrimination, \r\n  Sleepy Hollow need not show an evil or hostile motive. It is a violation of \r\n  the FHA to discriminate even if the County's motive was benign or paternalistic. \r\n  See Horizon \r\n  House Developmental Servs., Inc. v. Township of Upper Southampton, 804 \r\n  F. Supp. 683 (E.D. Pa. 1992), aff'd, \r\n  995 F.2d 217 (3rd Cir. 1993).\r\n  \r\nAn actionable intent to discriminate \r\n  need not be motivated by dislike for, or animosity against, people with disabilities; \r\n  the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act shows that Congress intended \r\n  equally to prohibit discrimination resulting from \"false and over-protective \r\n  assumptions about the needs of handicapped people, as well as unfounded fears \r\n  of difficulties about the problems that their tenancies may pose.\"\r\n  \r\nBryant \r\n  Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, 911 F. Supp. 918, 929 (D. Md. 1996), \r\n  aff'd, 124 F.3d 597 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).\r\n  \r\nNevertheless, a complainant alleging \r\n  intentional discrimination has the initial burden of showing that the decision \r\n  to deny housing opportunities was motivated, at least in part, by unjustified \r\n  consideration of the disabled status of individuals who would be affected by \r\n  the decision. Id. In this regard, \r\n  government officials are generally held to act with discriminatory intent, regardless \r\n  of their personal views, when they implement the discriminatory desires of others. \r\n  See Dailey \r\n  v. City of Lawton, 425 F.2d 1037, 1039 (10th Cir. 1970) (holding, \r\n  in a Â§ 1983 racial discrimination action, that \"it is enough for the complaining \r\n  parties to show that the local officials are effectuating the discriminatory \r\n  designs of private individuals\"); see \r\n  also United States v. Borough \r\n  of Audubon, 797 F. Supp. 353, 361 (D. N.J. 1991), aff'd, \r\n  968 F.2d 14 (3rd Cir. 1992). \r\n  \r\nWe acknowledge that government officials \r\n  may attempt to conceal discriminatory intent by claiming they relied upon objective, \r\n  neutral criteria. However, if a defendant's acts are undertaken with a discriminatory \r\n  motive, the FHA is violated even though such acts may have otherwise been justified \r\n  under state law. Audubon, 797 \r\n  F. Supp at 360. In this regard, \"[o]therwise lawful governmental actions become \r\n  unlawful when done for the purpose of disadvantaging the handicapped.\" Smith \r\n  &amp; Lee Assocs., Inc. v. City of Taylor, 102 F.3d 781, 790 (6th \r\n  Cir. 1996). Therefore, although the local government has a legitimate governmental \r\n  interest in regulating land use, we have a duty under the FHA to ensure that \r\n  such interest is effectuated in a nondiscriminatory manner. See \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§ 3615 (1999) (\"any law of a State, a political subdivision, or other \r\n  such jurisdiction that purports to require or permit any action that would be \r\n  a discriminatory housing practice under [the Act] shall to that extent be invalid\").\r\n  \r\n Determining whether a discriminatory \r\n  purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial \r\n  and direct evidence of intent as may be available. Arlington \r\n  Heights, 429 U.S. at 266. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has noted \r\n  that, \r\n  \r\nofficials acting in their official \r\n  capacities seldom, if ever, announce on the record that they are pursuing a \r\n  particular course of action because of their desire to discriminate. . . . Even \r\n  individuals acting from invidious motivations realize the unattractiveness of \r\n  their prejudices when faced with their perpetuation in the public record. It \r\n  is only in private conversation, with individuals assumed to share their [prejudice], \r\n  that open statements of discrimination are made, so it is rare that these statements \r\n  can be captured for the purposes of proving. . . discrimination in a case such \r\n  as this. \r\n  \r\nSmith \r\n  v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055, 1064 (4th Cir. 1982). \r\n  Nonetheless, upon review of the record, we find enough circumstantial and direct \r\n  evidence of intent in this case to justify further inquiry by the trial court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe residents mounted a letter-writing \r\n  campaign stating their objections to the location of the group home. These letters \r\n  contained concerns that the children could not appreciate certain dangers inherent \r\n  in living in a rural area next to a creek. The neighbors voiced concerns that \r\n  the children could not recognize and avoid poisonous snakes; that the children \r\n  would not know how to respond during an attack by a pack of wild dogs; that \r\n  the children would wander into the woods and accidently be shot by a hunter; \r\n  and that the children may drown in the nearby creek or pool. Although these \r\n  objections are couched in a protective attitude towards the children, further \r\n  inquiry is necessary because the FHA was intended to prohibit discrimination \r\n  based on false and overprotective assumptions about the needs of the handicapped. \r\n  See Bryant \r\n  Woods, 911 F. Supp at 929.\r\n  \r\nThere is also evidence that the residents \r\n  opposed the placement of the group home in what the residents felt was a desirable \r\n  neighborhood. One resident made remarks regarding the fact that the children \r\n  would be living in a luxury home that few people could ever afford to own. In \r\n  addition, another resident commented that \"placing eight disturbed and/or abused \r\n  children, who are unrelated . . . with a similar or larger number of unrelated \r\n  and low-paid adults in a home which none of them will own will adversely affect \r\n  the neighbors and their property.\" A resident even suggested that the group \r\n  home be removed to a house trailer. These particular remarks, when viewed in \r\n  a light most favorable to Sleepy Hollow, express an underlying discriminatory \r\n  attitude towards the handicapped.\r\n  \r\nEven before the children arrived \r\n  at the group home, the residents characterized themselves and the neighborhood \r\n  as hostile to the children. In an April 1, 1996 letter to SCDSS, one resident \r\n  described \"a hostile environment where the neighborhood does not want this facility.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a light most favorable to Sleepy \r\n  Hollow, the hostile treatment continued after the children arrived. A large \r\n  sign was placed in a driveway reading \"group home for troubled youth next driveway.\" \r\n  At least one resident insisted that he would conduct frequent photographic recording, \r\n  potentially with the use of a telephoto lens, of the group home in order to \r\n  track the number of children residing in the home. \r\n  \r\nWe find that these letters, comments \r\n  and hostile treatment establish evidence of discrimination by the residents \r\n  when viewed in a light most favorable to Sleepy Hollow. The residents, as constituents, \r\n  then voiced these \"concerns\" to the County. The County objected to the location \r\n  of the group home in response to the request of its constituents. Therefore, \r\n  a factual issue is presented as to whether the County, by implementing the potentially \r\n  discriminatory desires of their constituents, acted with discriminatory intent. \r\n  See Dailey, \r\n  425 F.2d at 1039. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court noted that the present \r\n  case is distinguishable from Audubon. \r\n  In Audubon, the District Court \r\n  found the record to be \"replete\" with circumstantial and direct evidence exposing \r\n  the municipality's discriminatory purpose. 797 F. Supp. 353, (D. N.J. 1991), \r\n  aff'd, 968 F.2d 14 (3rd \r\n  Cir. 1992). We make no determination as to whether the record in this case is \r\n  \"replete\" with evidence of the County's discriminatory purpose. However, we \r\n  find there is a factual issue presented as to whether a discriminatory purpose \r\n  was a motivating factor in the County's decision to object to the location of \r\n  the group home.\r\n  \r\nWe note a showing that the County's \r\n  decision was motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory intent is not a \r\n  dispositive question in this case. Once a plaintiff shows that a defendant's \r\n  decision was motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory intent, the burden \r\n  then shifts to the defendant to prove that it would have made the same decision \r\n  even if the impermissible purpose had not been considered. Arlington \r\n  Heights, 429 U.S. at 270 n. 21; see \r\n  also Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. \r\n  Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977) (holding that the district \r\n  court \"should have gone on to determine whether [defendant] had shown by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision . . . even in the \r\n  absence of the protected conduct.\").\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial \r\n  court's decision is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings \r\n  consistent with this opinion.\r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n  \r\n1.  \r\n  Although the County brought the action seeking Sleepy Hollow's compliance with \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 6-7-830(a) (Supp. 1999), the trial court's decision is based on \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 6-29-770 (Supp. 1999), which contains provisions identical to S.C. \r\n  Code Â§ 6-7-830(a) (Supp. 1999). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3162","title":"Paparella v.

Hunter, Jr., of Bodenheimer, \r\n          Busbee, Hunter &amp; Griffith, for respondent. \r\n           \r\n        Guardian ad Litem: James \r\n          L. Verenes, of Fox &amp; Verenes, both of Aiken.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n   \r\nPER CURIAM: In this \r\n  family court action, John F. Paparella, Jr. (father) appeals an order awarding \r\n  sole custody of the parties' three children to Ami Paparella (mother). The father \r\n  also appeals the visitation award. We affirm as modified. \r\n   \r\nThe father and mother were married \r\n  in September 1992 and separated in May&nbsp;1996. The father filed a complaint \r\n  seeking custody of the parties' three minor children and child support. The \r\n  mother filed a separate complaint requesting a divorce on the basis of one year's \r\n  continuous separation. The father, in turn, counterclaimed for a divorce based \r\n  on the mother's alleged adultery and prayed for merger of the divorce and custody \r\n  actions. The family court consolidated the actions. The court awarded the mother \r\n  a divorce and sole custody of the children and granted the father visitation \r\n  to include every other weekend, one week at Christmas, two two-week periods \r\n  in the summer, and alternating holidays. \r\n   \r\nI. Custody \r\n   \r\nThe father argues the family court \r\n  erred in granting custody of the minor children to the mother. We disagree. \r\n    \r\nThe paramount and controlling factor \r\n  in every custody dispute is the best interests of the child. Hooper v. Rockwell, \r\n  334 S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999). Although this court may find facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not required \r\n  to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight \r\n  to their testimony. See Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  154 (1996). In particular, an appellate court \"should be reluctant to substitute \r\n  its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.\" \r\n  Id. at 10, 471 S.E.2d at 157. Our broad scope of review does not relieve \r\n  appellant of his burden to convince this court the family court erred in its \r\n  factual findings and conclusions. See Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. \r\n  520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979).  \r\n   \r\nIn determining custody, the family \r\n  court \"must consider the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the \r\n  part of each parent as they impact the child[ren].\" Woodall, 322 S.C. \r\n  at 11, 471 S.E.2d at 157. Because all relevant factors must be taken into consideration, \r\n  the court should also review the \"psychological, physical, environmental, spiritual, \r\n  educational, medical, family, emotional and recreational aspects\" of each child's \r\n  life. Id. In other words, the totality of circumstances unique to each \r\n  particular case \"constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision \r\n  can be weighed.\" Parris v. Parris, 319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, \r\n  572 (1995).  \r\nFirst, the father contends the family \r\n  court improperly ignored evidence that the mother involved the parties' children \r\n  with her paramour. This argument is without merit. The family court found that \r\n  the mother's affair did not have any adverse effect on the children. The court \r\n  determined the affair occurred over one year after the parties' separation and \r\n  involved only one or two overnight stays while the children were gone. While \r\n  the father asserts error in the trial court's finding, he points to no evidence \r\n  in the record to contradict it. We therefore agree that the father has failed \r\n  to show any deleterious effect on the children stemming from the mother's admitted \r\n  affair. See Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d \r\n  228, 230 (1975) (\"The morality of a parent is a proper factor for consideration \r\n  but is limited in its force to what relevancy it has, either directly or indirectly, \r\n  to the welfare of the child. Custody of a child is not granted a party as a \r\n  reward or withheld as a punishment.\").  \r\n   \r\nSecond, the father claims the court \r\n  misunderstood the testimony and recommendations of the expert witnesses. In \r\n  effect, the father argues the trial court erred in accepting the testimony of \r\n  the mother's expert witnesses over his own witnesses' testimony. The family \r\n  court heard testimony from the father's experts that the father should be awarded \r\n  custody and testimony from the mother's experts that she should be awarded custody. \r\n  Given the conflicting testimony of the experts presented, we cannot say that \r\n  the family court erred. See, e.g., Woodall, 322 S.C. at 10, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d at 157 (appellate courts should be reluctant to supplant trial court's \r\n  evaluation of witness credibility regarding child custody).  \r\n   \r\nThird, the father also claims the \r\n  family court ignored significant safety issues regarding the children. The father \r\n  introduced a videotape, composed of various bits of film footage shot by the \r\n  mother at home, which he maintains is evidence of the mother's lack of concern \r\n  for the children's welfare. The trial court viewed the videotape and found nothing \r\n  to suggest the mother had abused or neglected the children. In particular, the \r\n  court noted that more than eighteen months had passed since the parties separated \r\n  with no indication whatsoever that the mother was unfit or neglectful in caring \r\n  for the children. We have viewed the videotape and, while portions do cause \r\n  some concern, we agree the mother's actions do not rise to the level of neglect \r\n  or unfitness.  \r\nFinally, the father argues the family \r\n  court erred in failing to consider his fitness as a parent in making the custody \r\n  determination. The trial court did not find the father was an unfit parent. \r\n  To the contrary, we agree the evidence in the record clearly indicates the father \r\n  is a concerned, loving parent. The question before us, however, is whether the \r\n  trial court abused its discretion in awarding custody to the mother. Because \r\n  the family court considered the totality of circumstances in determining the \r\n  custody arrangement best suited to the needs of the children, including the \r\n  emotional and physical fitness of both parents, safety considerations, and particularly \r\n  the recommendation of the guardian ad litem, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the court's decision.   \r\nII. Visitation \r\n   \r\nThe father claims the family court \r\n  erred in restricting his visitation to alternate weekends, one week at Christmas, \r\n  four weeks in the summer, and alternating holidays. We agree that the father's \r\n  visitation should be expanded. \r\n   \r\nAs with child custody, the welfare \r\n  and best interests of the child are the primary considerations in determining \r\n  visitation. Id. at 12, 471 S.E.2d at 158. Similarly, visitation is addressed \r\n  to the broad discretion of the family court and its decision will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent abuse. Id.  \r\n   \r\nThe father was awarded visitation \r\n  with the children every other weekend, beginning on Friday at 6 p.m. and ending \r\n  on Sunday at 6 p.m. The father does not think this is enough. In fact, the mother \r\n  admitted during trial that she thought the father should be awarded more visitation \r\n  than this. It is clear from the record that the father was involved in raising \r\n  his children and in their day-to-day activities. While the parties were married, \r\n  they worked as pharmacists at the same drugstore. They were able to arrange \r\n  their schedules so that one parent was home with the children while the other \r\n  parent was at work, thus eliminating the need for the children to be in daycare. \r\n   \r\nUnder the circumstances, we agree \r\n  with father that he should be allowed more visitation with the children. Pursuant \r\n  to the family court order, the father's visits are twelve days apart. Therefore, \r\n  we modify the visitation schedule to provide as follows: during the school year, \r\n  the father will have the children every other weekend, beginning after school \r\n  on Friday and ending when they return to school Monday morning. Then on the \r\n  Thursday preceding the weekend when the father does not have visitation, the \r\n  father will have the children after school until they return to school Friday \r\n  morning. Also on the Tuesday following the weekend when he does not have visitation, \r\n  the father will have them after school until they return to school Wednesday \r\n  morning. This will permit the father to see his children more often.  \r\n   \r\nThe father's summer visitation is \r\n  expanded so that he has the children half of the children's summer vacation. \r\n  We encourage the parties to work out the details-considering each of their schedules \r\n  as well as the children's schedules. In the event that they are unable to work \r\n  out the details, they can petition the family court to order the specifics of \r\n  the arrangement.  \r\nFurthermore, we encourage the parties \r\n  to consider permitting the parent not in physical custody to have the children \r\n  when the other parent is working, rather than leaving the children at daycare \r\n  or with a babysitter.   \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., \r\n  and MOREHEAD, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3154","title":"Hudson v.

The family court awarded the dependent tax exemption to the supporting, \r\n  non-custodial, parent for six years, with an automatic shift of the exemption \r\n  at the end of that period to the custodial spouse based upon her expected matriculation \r\n  from school, anticipated income upon graduation, and expected increases in child \r\n  care expenses. The family court also ordered that all of the minor child's unreimbursed \r\n  future medical and dental bills be divided pro rata between the parties. Thomas \r\n  Lee Hudson appeals. We reverse and remand.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nThomas Lee Hudson (the father) and \r\n  Punky Brewer Hudson (the mother) married in 1994 and divorced on February 23, \r\n  1998, after more than one year's separation. A son, born January 10, 1995, is \r\n  the only child of the marriage.  The family court bifurcated \r\n  the issue of divorce from issues concerning the child, and held a separate hearing \r\n  to determine custody, child support, visitation and equitable distribution on \r\n  May 14, 1998. \r\n  \r\nOn May 26, the court granted custody \r\n  to the mother. The court allocated the dependent tax exemption to the father \r\n  for tax years 1998-2003 inclusive, and allocated the exemption to the mother \r\n  beginning with the 2004 tax year. The basis for this change was twofold. The \r\n  family court anticipated that the mother would graduate from a college or technical \r\n  school, and generate a regular income. The family court also anticipated an \r\n  increase in the son's expenses upon the mother's graduation. The court further \r\n  ordered the division of the son's unreimbursed future health expenses on a pro \r\n  rata basis. \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, the father argues the \r\n  family court erred in transferring the benefit of the dependent tax exemption \r\n  to the mother at the end of six years absent a present change in circumstances. \r\n  Second, the father argues the court erred in failing to limit his pro rata obligation \r\n  for future unreimbursed medical and dental expenses for the son to extraordinary \r\n  expenses, defined under the Child Support Guidelines as those unreimbursed expenses \r\n  over $250 per year. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Tax Exemption\r\n  \r\nAs an initial matter, the mother \r\n  contends any issue regarding the allocation of the dependent tax exemption is \r\n  not preserved for review because the father failed to mention the issue in his \r\n  pleadings. See Abbott v. Gore, 304 S.C. 116, 119, 403 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  156 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding issue of dependent tax exemption must be specifically \r\n  plead, because though of \"some relation,\" it is a \"separate issue\" from child \r\n  support). However, the record clearly reflects the tax exemption question was \r\n  tried before the court without objection. Therefore, the mother may not now \r\n  complain on this ground. See Rule 15(b), SCRCP (\"When issues not raised \r\n  by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they \r\n  shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. \r\n  Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform \r\n  to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party \r\n  at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the \r\n  result of the trial of these issues.\"); Simmons v. Tuomey Reg'l Med. Ctr., \r\n  330 S.C. 115, 125 n.2, 498 S.E.2d 408, 413 n.2 (Ct. App. 1998) (an issue not \r\n  expressly mentioned in the complaint but tried without objection and incorporated \r\n  in the trial court's order is tried by consent according to Rule 15, SCRCP); \r\n  McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441, 481 S.E.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1997) (issues \r\n  tried by consent will be treated as if raised in the pleadings). \r\n  \r\nThe mother further argues this issue \r\n  is not preserved because the father failed to object to the court's ruling or \r\n  move to reconsider. However, once the tax exemption issue was raised to and \r\n  ruled upon by the family court, nothing remained for the court to consider and \r\n  the father correctly proceeded with his appeal. See, e.g., Hubbard \r\n  v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 19, 5 S.E.2d 187, 189 (1939) (\"[A]ll that this Court \r\n  has ever required is that the questions presented for its decision must first \r\n  have been fairly and properly raised in the lower Court and passed upon by that \r\n  Court.\"). \r\n  \r\nThe father first argues the family \r\n  court erred in transferring the benefit of the dependent tax exemption from \r\n  him to the mother after six years, absent a present showing of a change of circumstances. \r\n  We agree.\r\n  \r\nSection 20-3-130 provides, in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\n  \r\n (F) The court may elect and determine \r\n  the intended tax effect of the alimony and separate maintenance and support \r\n  as provided by the Internal Revenue Code and any corresponding state tax provisions. \r\n  The Family Court may allocate the right to claim dependency exemptions pursuant \r\n  to the Internal Revenue Code and under corresponding state tax provisions and \r\n  to require the execution and delivery of all necessary documents and tax filings \r\n  in connection with the exemption. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(F) (Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nThe mother counters that this statute \r\n  is contained within the provisions pertaining to alimony and spousal support, \r\n  and therefore only allows the family court to allocate a dependency exemption \r\n  pursuant to an award of alimony or separate maintenance and support. Therefore, \r\n  the father cannot complain, because, as the custodial parent, she was entitled \r\n  to the dependency exemption in each year. We disagree with this interpretation \r\n  of the statute. \r\n  \r\nThe mother's argument assumes this \r\n  statutory provision applies only to cases where the court awards the exemption \r\n  as an incident of spousal support because the first sentence of the subsection \r\n  makes reference to alimony and separate support and maintenance. As our supreme \r\n  court has often stated, however, where \"a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, \r\n  and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or \r\n  impose another meaning.\" Ray Bell Constr. Co., Inc. v. School Dist. of Greenville \r\n  County, 331 S.C. 19, 25-26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998) (quoting Paschal \r\n  v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 436-37, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995)). \r\n  Hence, this Court cannot review a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary \r\n  meaning, and \"may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt \r\n  to limit or expand a statute's scope.\" Id. at 26, 501 S.E.2d at \r\n  729 (emphasis added). Since the language of Â§ 20-3-130(F) is clear, unambiguous, \r\n  and internally consistent, we refuse to adopt the mother's constrained view \r\n  of the family court's authority to allocate dependent tax exemptions. We believe \r\n  the legislature, through the language employed, did not intend to make the family \r\n  court's authority to allocate the right to claim dependency exemptions exclusively \r\n  incident to proceedings for spousal support. \r\n  \r\nCiting Dodge v. Dodge, 332 \r\n  S.C. 401, 505 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1998) and Josey v. Josey, 291 S.C. \r\n  26, 351 S.E.2d 891 (Ct. App. 1986), the mother next argues the lower court's \r\n  order should be affirmed because \"[u]nder the applicable tax laws, a custodial \r\n  parent is entitled to claim the child as an [sic] dependent unless that right \r\n  is relinquished in writing.\"  These cases, however, are easily \r\n  distinguished from the case at bar. While Dodge and Josey both \r\n  correctly state that the custodial parent is entitled to claim the dependent \r\n  tax deduction under the governing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, neither \r\n  case addresses the issue of the family court's authority to \r\n  allocate the exemption.(1) \r\n  \r\nMoreover, the Internal Revenue Code \r\n  does not mandate that the custodial parent take the deduction. Instead, it merely \r\n  outlines a \"support test\" that divorced parents attempting to claim the exemption \r\n  must meet in order to comply with the eligibility requirements of the applicable \r\n  tax laws and IRS rules. See I.R.C. Â§ 152. The fact that section 152 provides \r\n  a mechanism for the custodial parent to \"waive\" his or her entitlement to the \r\n  exemption anticipates that the custodial parent may not have the option of taking \r\n  it. See I.R.C. Â§ 152(e)(2)(A) &amp; (B) (providing that a noncustodial \r\n  parent who obtains a written declaration from a custodial parent stating that \r\n  the custodial parent will not claim the parties' child as a dependent for that \r\n  tax year may then take the exemption). The majority of jurisdictions interpreting \r\n  section 152 have likewise come to the same conclusion.(2) \r\n  Accordingly, we find the allocation of a dependent tax exemption to be within \r\n  the family court's discretion.(3) See \r\n  Dodge, 332 S.C. at 418, 505 S.E.2d at 353. \r\n  \r\nHere, the family court reasoned that \r\n  giving each party equal opportunity to claim the dependent tax exemption for \r\n  their son was \"the most equitable way to distribute this benefit.\" The exemption, \r\n  however, while certainly a benefit, should not be considered an asset subject \r\n  to equitable distribution. In Kriesel v. Gustafson, the Minnesota Court \r\n  of Appeals addressed this precise issue: \r\n  \r\nThe trial court's characterization \r\n  that the right to claim children as a tax exemption as property to be valued \r\n  in a dissolution proceeding is neither accurate nor appropriate. [Wife] cannot \r\n  sell or transfer this right to any person other than [Husband]. [Wife] contends \r\n  that she cannot use the dependency deduction as loan collateral. The only benefit \r\n  [Wife] receives from this tax deduction is a decreased tax liability and a resulting \r\n  increase in net income in future years . . . . The amount of the exemptions \r\n  and benefit received are unknown at this time because the amount is dependent \r\n  on any future changes in the tax codes and [Wife]'s income. \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n[I]t is important to examine the \r\n  underlying purpose for the dependency tax exemption. Unlike the many cases regarding \r\n  tax consequences relative to marital property, this case involves tax consequences \r\n  relative to child custody. . . . The dependency exemption relates to an exemption \r\n  for the party who provided[.] . . . more than 50% of the financial support [for] \r\n  the child during the year in which the exemption is claimed. See 26 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 152(e)(1). \r\n  \r\nKriesel, 513 N.W. 2d 9, 12, \r\n  14 (Minn. Ct. App. 1994). See also Hutchinson v. Hutchinson, 619 \r\n  N.E.2d 466 (Ohio App. 1993) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in \r\n  declining to consider income of mother's new spouse in determining whether it \r\n  was in children's best interest to modify dissolution decree to allow mother \r\n  to claim children as dependents for tax purposes); In re Marriage of Ford, \r\n  851 P.2d 295 (Colo. App. 1993) (trial court was authorized to modify terms of \r\n  original dissolution decree, which awarded tax exemptions for both children \r\n  to father, on showing by mother of substantial and continuing change of circumstances); \r\n  Monterey County v. Cornejo, 812 P.2d 586 (Cal. 1991) (court's allocation \r\n  of tax exemption for minor child to noncustodial parent in enforcement proceeding \r\n  was proper, as dependency exemption is highly pertinent to issue of child support); \r\n  Ford v. Ford, 592 So.2d 698 (Fla. App. 1991) (in child support proceeding, \r\n  trial court may order custodial parent to execute release of federal income \r\n  tax dependency exemption, and thereby transfer exemption to noncustodial parent); \r\n  Sertic v. Sertic, 901 P.2d 148 (Nev. 1995) (in divorce action, district \r\n  court did not err by directing parties to alternate the federal dependency tax \r\n  exemption on yearly basis where the parents shared custody of the minor child).(4)\r\n  \r\nWe therefore agree with the father \r\n  that the rationale employed by the family court in switching the exemption to \r\n  the mother in the year 2004 is flawed, as it ignores the speculative nature \r\n  of predicting the parties' future financial situations. \r\n  \r\nSince the father is presently paying \r\n  $774.78 in monthly child support, a full 81% of the Guideline amount, the family \r\n  court abused its discretion in automatically reallocating the dependent tax \r\n  exemption to the mother absent any evidence of actual changed circumstances \r\n  warranting the reallocation. See Harlan v. Harlan, 300 S.C. 537, \r\n  543, 389 S.E.2d 165, 169 (Ct. App. 1990) (modifying trial court's pre-emptive \r\n  finding that child's future emancipation would not constitute a change in circumstances \r\n  for child support purposes, as it had no apparent basis in the record and was \r\n  therefore \"analogous to an improper automatic increase in child support without \r\n  a showing of a change in circumstances\"). \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the family \r\n  court's order to the extent that it provides for an automatic transfer of the \r\n  dependent tax exemption from the father to the mother in the year 2004, and \r\n  remand for the family court to enforce the allocation of the dependent exemption. \r\n  We note, however, that the mother may petition for reallocation of the exemption \r\n  based upon changed circumstances, and the family court may decide whether a \r\n  change in circumstances has been shown under the facts as they then exist.\r\n  \r\nII. Medical Expenses\r\n  \r\nThe father next contends the court \r\n  erred in ordering the parties to proportionally split unreimbursed future health \r\n  expenses incurred by their son without specifying that the mother, as the custodial \r\n  parent, is obligated to bear the first $250 of such expenses each year. We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court ordered the parties \r\n  to \"split, pro-rata, any uncovered medical and dental expenses.\" The mother \r\n  first argues this issue is not preserved because the father did not object at \r\n  the hearing or file a post-trial motion to alter or amend. Alternatively, the \r\n  mother asserts that because the father, in his responsive pleadings, agreed \r\n  the parties should split uncovered medical expenses equally, he is barred from \r\n  claiming on appeal that she should pay the first $250. As noted in the discussion \r\n  of the previous issue, however, the father is under no obligation to object \r\n  to the trial court's decision on an issue already raised to and ruled on by \r\n  the court. In addition, the mother's assertion that the issue is barred by an \r\n  \"agreement\" made by the father in the pleadings ignores the fact that the father, \r\n  in his Answer, specifically asked the court to allocate unreimbursed medical \r\n  expenses equally, while the final order requires him to pay a proportional share, \r\n  in this instance 81%. Obviously there was no agreement on this issue. \r\n  \r\nWe conclude that the father should \r\n  not be required to forfeit his right to have the mandatory South Carolina Child \r\n  Support Guidelines applied as enacted. In 1989, the legislature amended section \r\n  43-5-580(b) of the Code to include the following: \r\n  \r\nThe department [of social services] \r\n  shall promulgate regulations which establish guidelines for minimum contributions \r\n  which must be applied by the courts in determining the amount that an \r\n  absent parent is expected to pay toward the support of a dependent child. . \r\n  . . \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-5-580(b) (Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added). Thereafter, the Guidelines were promulgated as regulations \r\n  of the Department of Social Services. See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4710 \r\n  to -4750 (Supp. 1998). Regarding health insurance for supported children, the \r\n  Guidelines provide, in relevant part:\r\n  \r\nThe Guidelines are based on the assumption \r\n  that the custodial parent will be responsible for up to $250.00 per year per \r\n  child in uninsured medical expenses. Extraordinary medical expenses, not addressed \r\n  in the [G]uidelines, are defined as reasonable and necessary uninsured medical \r\n  expenses in excess of $250.00 per year per child. . . . Extraordinary unreimbursed \r\n  medical expenses addressed by the court shall be divided in pro rata percentages \r\n  based on the proportional share of combined monthly adjusted income, on Line \r\n  8, Worksheet A. \r\n  \r\nId. at 114-4720(F).(5) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Guidelines clearly indicate the \r\n  custodial parent should pay the first $250 of unreimbursed medical expenses \r\n  for each child. However, the Guidelines grant the family court the discretion \r\n  to modify the amount of child support that would result from application of \r\n  the Guidelines, as follows:\r\n  \r\n[A] different amount may be awarded \r\n  upon a showing that application of the guidelines is inappropriate. When the \r\n  court orders a child support award that varies significantly from the amount \r\n  resulting from the application of the guidelines, the court shall make specific, \r\n  written findings of those facts upon which it bases its conclusion supporting \r\n  that award.\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nDeviations from the guidelines should \r\n  be the exception rather than the rule. When the court deviates, it must make \r\n  written findings which clearly state the nature and extent of the variation \r\n  from the guidelines. These Child Support Guidelines do not take into account \r\n  the economic impact of the following factors which can be possible reasons for \r\n  deviation:\r\n  \r\n(5) Unreimbursed extraordinary medical/dental \r\n  expenses for the noncustodial or custodial parent. . . . \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4710(A)(1) \r\n  &amp; (B) (Supp. 1998). In this case, the family court did not address any specific \r\n  factors or make any written findings presenting a basis for deviation from the \r\n  Guidelines. As such, we find the family court erred by including usual and customary \r\n  expenditures in the pro rata division. See Miller v. Miller, 299 \r\n  S.C. 307, 314, 384 S.E.2d 715, 719 (1989) (\"In instances where the [Child Support] \r\n  Guidelines are utilized, they must be used properly.\"); but see RGM \r\n  v. DEM, 306 S.C. 145, 150-151, 410 S.E.2d 564, 567-568 (1991) (in case utilizing \r\n  Guidelines, supreme court found no abuse of discretion despite appellant's claim \r\n  that family court's 60/40 apportionment of childrens' uncovered medical bills \r\n  was an improper allocation based on the court's use of the same percentage as \r\n  for the distribution of marital property, where appellant made no \"affirmative \r\n  showing to the contrary\"). \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the family \r\n  court's determination that the unreimbursed health expenses should be split \r\n  pro rata without accounting for the custodial parent's responsibility to bear \r\n  the first $250 per year. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court is \r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n  \r\n1.

Â§ 152. \r\n4.  Two \r\n  prior decisions of this Court touch on the question of a dependent tax exemption \r\n  as it relates to child support; both are distinguishable. In Robinson v. \r\n  Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 364-365, 461 S.E.2d 397, 400 (Ct. App. 1995), we held \r\n  that the question of the modification of an agreed upon tax exemption \r\n  does not \"fall[] within the ambit of the pervasiveness of the Supreme Court's \r\n  statement in Moseley that family courts shall have 'continuing jurisdiction \r\n  to do what is in the best interest of the child regardless of what the separation \r\n  agreement specifies,'\" because Moseley clearly \"relates to matters that \r\n  directly affect the best interests of the child, not to matters that may incidently \r\n  or indirectly affect them.\" Here, on the other hand, we are concerned with the \r\n  family court's authority to allocate the tax exemption and not with a settlement \r\n  agreement. In addition, in Abbott v. Gore, 304 S.C. 116, 119, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  154, 156 (Ct. App. 1991), we reversed the family court's award of a dependent \r\n  tax exemption to the father because he failed to plead it or otherwise raise \r\n  it at trial, holding that the court's finding that the issue \"was within the \r\n  scope of relief as it touched on the issue of child support\" was erroneous. \r\n  In so doing, we stated that the issue of the dependency exemption, though of \r\n  \"some relation,\" is a \"separate issue\" from child support. Again, the case at \r\n  bar may be distinguished as the tax exemption issue was tried by consent despite \r\n  the father's failure to plead it. \r\n 5.  The \r\n  1999 amendment rewrote this regulation, but the applicable language can be found \r\n  in 27 S.C. Code Ann.

We reverse and remand.(1)\r\n  \r\n At the time of the family court \r\n  hearing, Jonathan had been living with the Rayers about thirteen months after \r\n  the family court placed him in the custody of the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Social Services. On August 31, 1998, representatives of the Department met \r\n  with the Rayers and a mental health counselor to discuss the counselor's recommendation \r\n  that Jonathan be removed from his foster care placement with the Rayers. This \r\n  recommendation came about as a result of allegations made the previous week \r\n  that Angie Rayer had improperly disciplined Jonathan by placing him in \"time \r\n  out\" for excessive amounts of time. Before the meeting, Department representatives \r\n  had discussed appropriate discipline and unrealistic behavioral expectations \r\n  with the Rayers.\r\n  \r\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, \r\n  the Department informed the Rayers in writing of its decision to remove Jonathan \r\n  from their home within ten days. The basis for the intended removal was the \r\n  Rayers' alleged violation of a foster care licensing regulation requiring that \r\n  all discipline be reasonable in manner, moderate in degree, and responsibly \r\n  related to the foster child's understanding and need. The written notice included \r\n  the following provision: \"You have the right to appeal the removal of Jonathan \r\n  from your home. An appeal must be given to Lexington County DSS in writing.\" \r\n  On September 9, 1998, when a representative of the Department attempted to pick \r\n  Jonathan up from the Rayers' home, the Rayers denied the representative entry \r\n  to their residence and gave the Department written notice of their intention \r\n  to appeal its decision to place Jonathan in another foster home.\r\n  \r\nOn September 15, 1998, the Department \r\n  filed a \"notice and motion for emergency hearing,\" requesting authorization \r\n  from the family court to remove Jonathan from his foster care placement with \r\n  the Rayers. The notice and motion were accompanied by an order of the family \r\n  court setting the hearing date for the following day.\r\n  \r\nThe Department did not serve the \r\n  Rayers with the pleadings filed in connection with the emergency hearing; however, \r\n  the Rayers received notice of the proceedings by telephone and appeared at the \r\n  hearing with their attorney. Also present were counsel for \r\n  the Department, counsel for Jonathan's biological mother, and the guardian ad \r\n  litem.\r\n  \r\nThe family court conducted the hearing \r\n  without testimony, relying instead on affidavits from Department representatives. \r\n  The family court also heard arguments from counsel and allowed the guardian \r\n  ad litem to express her position on the issues. The Rayers' attorney stated \r\n  his clients had filed an administrative appeal of the Department's decision \r\n  to change Jonathan's placement and expressed his confidence they would ultimately \r\n  prevail. The guardian recommended Jonathan remain in the Rayers' care pending \r\n  a full hearing, including testimony, on the merits of the Department's request \r\n  for removal.\r\n  \r\nAt the hearing, the family court \r\n  issued a summary order from the bench directing that Jonathan be immediately \r\n  returned to the custody and placement of the Department. In a supplemental order \r\n  dated September 28, 1998, the family court explained the grant of this relief \r\n  was based on: (1) its determination that the Department had ultimate responsibility \r\n  for foster care placements and the well being of children within the foster \r\n  care system; (2) its conclusion there was \"no right place\" for Jonathan at the \r\n  time; and (3) the fact that reunification of Jonathan with his biological mother \r\n  was still a viable option at the time of the hearing.(2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn their appeal to this court, the \r\n  Rayers assert that, because the Department failed to comply with its own regulations \r\n  governing disputes over foster care placement, the family court erred in allowing \r\n  the Department to remove Jonathan from their care. We agree.\r\n  \r\nThe regulatory scheme governing removal \r\n  of foster children from foster care placement homes is set forth at 27 S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 114-110 (1976). Pursuant to these regulations, foster parents \r\n  are entitled to at least ten days advance notice of a decision by the Department \r\n  to remove a foster child from their home unless: (1) removal is deemed necessary \r\n  for the protection of the foster child; (2) the foster home license has been \r\n  finally revoked; or (3) the foster parents themselves have requested the child's \r\n  removal.(3) In the event a foster parent files \r\n  an administrative appeal challenging the Department's decision to remove a foster \r\n  child who has resided continuously with the foster parent for more than six \r\n  months, that child \"shall not be removed from their care pending the final decision \r\n  on the appeal.\"(4) In such an administrative \r\n  appeal, the foster parents are entitled to no less than thirty days notice of \r\n  the hearing, and the notice must include the legal and factual basis for the \r\n  agency's decision.(5) As well, the foster parents \r\n  should have the opportunity to review all documents and records on which the \r\n  agency will rely at the hearing.(6)\r\n  \r\nHere, the Department failed to give \r\n  the Rayers the procedural protections mandated by the governing regulations. \r\n  Although the Rayers gave the Department written notice of their intention to \r\n  appeal the decision to remove Jonathan from their home, they were never given \r\n  the requisite thirty days notice of a merits hearing on their appeal. Moreover, \r\n  even though Jonathan had resided with the Rayers for thirteen months before \r\n  the Department decided to change his foster care placement, he was not, contrary \r\n  to the applicable regulation, allowed to remain with the Rayers while their \r\n  appeal was pending.(7) In fact, as the Department \r\n  itself stated in its brief, no fair hearing on the Rayers' administrative appeal \r\n  has taken place.(8) \r\n  \r\nWe therefore hold the family court \r\n  erred in allowing the Department to remove Jonathan from the Rayers' care without \r\n  first requiring it to comply with the applicable regulations governing such \r\n  removals. We therefore reverse the appealed order and remand the case for an \r\n  administrative hearing in compliance with Regulation 114-110.(9)\r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Because \r\n  oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues involved in this \r\n  appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n   \r\n2. Counsel \r\n  has informed this court that, while this appeal was pending, the parental rights \r\n  of Jonathan's biological parents have been terminated.  \r\n3. 27 \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.

The Department \r\n  contends that, because it determined that removal of Jonathan from the Rayers' \r\n  care was necessary for his protection, it did not act in derogation of the regulatory \r\n  scheme established to hear and decide disputes over foster care placement. We \r\n  find no merit to this argument. First, as the Department itself conceded, the \r\n  Rayers have never been charged with abusing or neglecting Jonathan. More importantly, \r\n  the Department relies on Regulation 114-110(E)(5) to support its position. As \r\n  stated in the body of this opinion, however, that regulation exempts the Department, \r\n  in certain situations, only from giving the foster parents the initial ten-day \r\n  notice of its intention to remove a child from their care. Without question, \r\n  the Rayers received the initial ten-day notice. The Rayers' appeal to this court \r\n  concerns the procedural irregularities occurring after they notified the Department \r\n  that they were appealing its decision to remove Jonathan from their home. \r\n8.  We disagree \r\n  with the Department's argument that the family court decision to allow Jonathan's \r\n  removal from the Rayers' home should be upheld because the Rayers failed to \r\n  complete the necessary paperwork to perfect their administrative appeal. The \r\n  applicable regulation requires only that the foster parent or other claimant \r\n  request a fair hearing \"by making any clear expression, either oral or written, \r\n  to the effect that the claimant wishes to go beyond the usual procedure for \r\n  adjusting complaints and desires an opportunity to present his complaint to \r\n  the agency.\" Regulation 114-110(D)(1). Although, as the Department notes, the \r\n  regulation states that a DSS Form 1206 must then be completed, it also provides \r\n  that \"[t]he effective date of the request for appeal shall be the date upon \r\n  which the oral and written request was made, and not the date of signing of \r\n  DSS Form 1206, if different.\" Id. at 114-110(D)(1)(b). \r\n9.  To minimize \r\n  any further disruption in this case, the Department shall retain control over \r\n  Jonathan's foster care placement while the Rayers' administrative appeal is \r\n  pending. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3157","title":"United Services Automobile Assn. v.

State Farm appeals the trial \r\n  court's grant of summary judgment to USAA, asserting that it is only liable \r\n  for the minimum statutory limits, rather than the full policy amount, where \r\n  its insured breached the cooperation clause in the policy. We reverse.\r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nOn November 20, 1994, Douglas J. \r\n  Markosky was injured when the bicycle he was riding collided with a motor vehicle \r\n  operated by Danette Frazier. Both parties claimed the other's negligence caused \r\n  the accident. At the time of the accident, State Farm provided liability coverage \r\n  to Frazier in amounts up to $50,000 per person, not to exceed $100,000 per accident. \r\n  The policy's terms required Frazier to send State Farm \"at once every demand, \r\n  notice or claim made and every summons or legal process received.\" The policy \r\n  also imposed upon Frazier a duty to cooperate with State Farm in the settlement \r\n  or litigation of claims. \r\n  \r\nMarkosky sued Frazier as a result \r\n  of the accident. Frazier was served with the summons and complaint on August \r\n  29, 1995. She failed to answer or notify State Farm in any way that she had \r\n  been served. The court placed her in default on or about September 29, 1995. \r\n  State Farm was unable to obtain relief from the default, and the parties have \r\n  stipulated that State Farm was prejudiced when it lost its right to contest \r\n  Frazier's liability, assert Markosky's comparative negligence, and demand a \r\n  jury trial on damages. \r\n  \r\nMarkosky's total damages as a result \r\n  of the accident are at least $65,000, and the parties have agreed that is a \r\n  reasonable settlement amount. State Farm paid Markosky $15,000, but denies any \r\n  additional coverage under the policy due to Frazier's failure to notify State \r\n  Farm of the action. USAA, as Markosky's underinsured motorist coverage carrier, \r\n  paid $50,000 to settle his total damages. In exchange, Markosky signed a policy \r\n  release, assignment, and settlement agreement.\r\n  \r\nUSAA then brought this declaratory \r\n  judgment action to determine whether the State Farm policy affords an additional \r\n  $35,000 in liability coverage to Frazier for the accident. State Farm and USAA \r\n  agreed that State Farm would reimburse USAA for the UIM benefits paid to Markosky \r\n  if such a determination were made. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court granted USAA summary \r\n  judgment, finding State Farm's attempt to avoid any coverage in excess of the \r\n  mandatory minimum limits contravenes the requirements of the Insurance Code, \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 38-77-10 et seq. (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999), and the Financial \r\n  Responsibility Act, S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 56-9-10 et seq. (1991 &amp; Supp. \r\n  1999) . It held the State Farm policy provided Frazier a total of $50,000 in \r\n  liability insurance coverage for Markosky's claims and damages. \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Wilson v. Moseley, 327 S.C. \r\n  144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1997) (citation omitted). \"In ruling on a motion \r\n  for summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably \r\n  drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.\" Id.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nState Farm asserts unambiguous policy \r\n  terms and conditions, as applied to coverage in excess of the minimum limits \r\n  required by law, do not contravene the applicable statutory scheme. We agree.\r\n  \r\n\"[I]nsurers have the right to limit \r\n  their liability and to impose whatever conditions they desire upon an insured, \r\n  provided they are not in contravention of some statutory inhibition or public \r\n  policy.\" Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. Casualty Ins. Co. v. Parker, 282 S.C. \r\n  546, 550-51, 320 S.E.2d 458, 461 (Ct. App. 1984) (citations omitted). \"Reasonable \r\n  exclusionary clauses which do not conflict with the legislative expression of \r\n  the public policy of the State as revealed in the various motor vehicle insurance \r\n  statutes are permitted.\" Id. at 551, 320 S.E.2d at 461. \"Where a statute \r\n  requires insurance for the benefit of the public, however, the insurer is not \r\n  permitted to nullify its purposes through engrafting exceptions from liability \r\n  as to uses which it was the evident purpose of the statute to cover.\" Id.\r\n  \r\nThe Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility \r\n  Act requires, in part, that a \"motor vehicle liability policy\" fulfill the requirements \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999) (Liability coverage for \r\n  damages arising out of ownership, maintenance or use must be issued, subject \r\n  to limits of: \"fifteen thousand dollars because of bodily injury to one person \r\n  in any one accident and, subject to the limit for one person, thirty thousand \r\n  dollars because of bodily injury to two or more in any one accident. . . .\"). \r\n  The Act further subjects every motor vehicle liability policy to the following \r\n  provisions: \r\n  \r\n(1) The liability of the insurance \r\n  carrier with respect to the insurance required by this chapter shall become \r\n  absolute whenever injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle liability policy \r\n  occurs;\r\n  \r\n. . .\r\n  \r\n(3) No statement made by the insured \r\n  or on his behalf and no violation of the policy shall defeat or void the policy[.]\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-20(5)(b) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n \r\nHowever, the Financial Responsibility \r\n  Act specifically permits coverage beyond the mandated minimum limits of Â§ 38-77-140, \r\n  and further makes inapplicable the mandatory provisions of Â§ 56-9-20(5)(b) to \r\n  excess coverage. It states in part:\r\n  \r\nAdditional coverage permitted. Any \r\n  policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy \r\n  may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage \r\n  specified for a motor vehicle liability policy and the excess or additional \r\n  coverage shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter. With respect \r\n  to a policy which grants this excess or additional coverage, the term \"motor \r\n  vehicle liability policy\" shall apply only to that part of the coverage which \r\n  is required by this article.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-20(5)(d) (Supp. \r\n  1999). The statutory section which sets the mandatory minimum liability limits \r\n  further states: \"Nothing in this article prevents an insurer from issuing, selling, \r\n  or delivering a policy providing liability coverage in excess of these requirements.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. 1999). This court has acknowledged \"[i]t is \r\n  clear that, while additional coverage is permitted by the Act, only the minimum \r\n  limit is mandatory.\" Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Metropolitan Property \r\n  and Life Ins. Co., 298 S.C. 404, 410, 380 S.E.2d 858, 862 (Ct. App.1989). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Universal Underwriters, \r\n  this court upheld a policy provision that limited coverage for injuries to an \r\n  insured to the minimum limits, while providing a maximum of $500,000 in liability \r\n  coverage for injuries to others. The court found the Financial Responsibility \r\n  Act \"provides no basis to hold that the provision of the policy limiting coverage \r\n  to the statutory minimum is contrary to public policy.\" Id. at 410, 380 \r\n  S.E.2d at 862; See George v. Empire Fire and Marine Ins. Co., \r\n  336 S.C. 206, 519 S.E.2d 107 (Ct. App. 1999) (cert. pending) (upholding exclusion \r\n  for coverage of permissive users in excess policy, in two policy structure).\r\n  \r\nIn Shores v. Weaver, 315 S.C. \r\n  347, 433 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 1993) this court held, as a matter of public policy, \r\n  that a minimum limits automobile liability insurance policy was not defeated \r\n  or voided by the insured's failure to comply with policy notice provisions after \r\n  the accident, because the coverage was mandated by the legislature to protect \r\n  innocent third parties. State Farm acknowledges that, under Shores v. Weaver, \r\n  it may not avoid payment of the statutory minimum coverage. It contends, however, \r\n  that its insured's breach of the policy defeats coverage in excess of the mandatory \r\n  minimum limits.\r\n  \r\nOur sister state, North Carolina, \r\n  has addressed an issue similar to that presented in this case. The North Carolina \r\n  Court of Appeals, relying on G.S. Â§ 20-279.21 (g), which is identical to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-20(5)(d), found,\r\n  \r\n[T]he holding . . . that fraud in \r\n  an application for motor vehicle liability insurance is not a defense to the \r\n  insurer's liability once injury has occurred, applies only to the statutory \r\n  minimum amount. In the case sub judice, the stated policy limit was greater \r\n  than the statutory minimum and as to that amount, the above analysis does not \r\n  apply. . . . We therefore hold that as to any coverage in excess of the statutory \r\n  minimum, the insurer is not precluded by statute or public policy from asserting \r\n  the defense of fraud. . . .\r\n  \r\nOdum v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., \r\n  401 S.E.2d 87, 91, 92 (N.C. Ct. App. 1991), review denied, 407 S.E.2d \r\n  539 (N.C. 1991); see Swain v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co, 116 S.E.2d \r\n  482 (N.C. 1960) (stating Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act of 1957 changed \r\n  the law with respect to the compulsory amount such that a violation of a policy \r\n  provision was not a defense to liability of the insurer, but as to any amount \r\n  in excess of that, a policy provision requiring notice to the insurer would \r\n  be enforced as written and a violation was a valid and complete defense). We \r\n  find this reasoning persuasive because our Legislature has provided that the \r\n  Act is to be construed so as to make uniform the laws of those states which \r\n  enact substantially identical legislation. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-120 \r\n  (Supp. 1999).(1)\r\n USAA submits that liability coverage \r\n  in excess of the statutory minimum limits is, in effect, mandatory from the \r\n  perspective of the insurer. See S.C. Code Â§ 38-77-110(A) &amp; (B) (Supp. \r\n  1998) (requiring an insurer to write liability coverage with limits up to $250,000/$500,000 \r\n  at the request of its insured).(2) USAA further \r\n  argues this form of \"mandatory\" coverage is subject to the same public policy \r\n  argument as applied in Shores, that coverage required to protect an innocent \r\n  party against an insured's negligence will not be defeated by a violation of \r\n  policy provisions. In Shores, this court recognized that \"[t]he purpose \r\n  of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act and the Automobile Reparation \r\n  Reform Act of 1974 is to afford greater protection to those injured through \r\n  the negligent operation of automobiles in this State.\" Shores, 315 S.C. \r\n  at 354, 433 S.E.2d at 916 (citations omitted). That public policy, however, \r\n  has been effected by the enactment of the minimal limits coverage statute found \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140. As recognized in Shores, \"the legislature \r\n  has determined that for all vehicles registered in South Carolina, at least \r\n  minimal coverage is necessary to protect the public.\" Id. at 355, 433 \r\n  S.E.2d at 917. To the extent the legislature determines this public policy is \r\n  not being effected, it has the option of raising the minimum limits. We will \r\n  not construe the plain language of the statute to extend the public policy beyond \r\n  that which was plainly intended. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn this case, the parties agreed \r\n  Frazier failed to comply with the policy's terms and conditions, resulting in \r\n  substantial prejudice to State Farm. We find no conflicting statutory provision \r\n  overriding State Farm's authority to avoid coverage in excess of the statutory \r\n  minimum limits under these circumstances. Therefore, we hold State Farm owes \r\n  no further coverage under the policy. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nCONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n1.
