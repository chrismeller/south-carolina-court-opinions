(â€œSeamless Guttersâ€).&nbsp; Seamless\r\nGutters was in the business of manufacturing and installing roof gutters.&nbsp;\r\nThe agreement granted Seamless Gutters the right to manufacture, sell, and\r\ninstall Englertâ€™s product, the LeafGuard Gutter System (a patented gutter\r\nsystem which protects against blockage caused by leaves and debris), in a\r\npre-determined sales territory.&nbsp; The agreement also called for the purchase\r\nof a gutter-fabricating machine (â€œthe Machineâ€) to produce the Englert\r\ngutters.&nbsp; Seamless Gutters was required to pay a $5,000 deposit on the\r\nMachine and pay the remaining $21,000 balance upon its delivery.&nbsp; The\r\ncontract also included the following buy-back provision:\r\n\r\n  Upon termination of this\r\n  Agreement, Englert shall purchase, and Sub-Licensee shall sell, the Englert\r\n  LeafGuard Gutter Machine, subject to normal wear and tear and pay Sub-Licensee\r\n  at a price equal to the greater of:\r\n  (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  the depreciated value of the Englert LeafGuard&nbsp;&nbsp; Gutter Machine,\r\n  based on a depreciated rate of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% per year on the original\r\n  price; or\r\n  (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1.00\r\n\r\nUpon the Machineâ€™s delivery,\r\nSeamless Gutters paid the full purchase price and began to manufacture, sell,\r\nand install the Englert Gutter System in its contractual sales territory.\r\nIn 1994, Vickory incorporated a\r\nsecond company, LeafGuard USA, Inc.,[2]\r\nwhich engaged in the same business as Seamless Gutters in the same sales\r\nterritory.&nbsp; The incorporation of the new business essentially constituted\r\nthe mere renaming of Seamless Gutters; however, Seamless Gutters remained an\r\nincorporated entity.&nbsp; Pursuant to Seamless Gutterâ€™s 1993 contract with\r\nEnglert, Leafguard USA utilized the Machine for the manufacturing and sale of\r\nthe Englert LeafGuard Gutter System.&nbsp;\r\nIn 1999, Vickory renewed the 1993\r\ncontract with Englert, this time acting on behalf of the more recently created\r\nLeafGuard USA, Inc.&nbsp; The 1999 contract is essentially identical to the 1993\r\ncontract, granting LeafGuard USA the right to sell Englertâ€™s product in the\r\nterritory defined by the 1993 agreement.&nbsp; The 1999 contract also contains\r\nidentical language regarding the purchase of an Englert gutter-fabricating\r\nmachine.&nbsp; However, because LeafGuard USA already possessed the Machine\r\npurchased under the 1993 contract, no gutter-fabricating machine was actually\r\npurchased under the 1999 contract.\r\nThe 1999 contract, similar to that\r\nof 1993 (as later amended), set a â€œsales targetâ€ of 15,000 lineal feet of\r\nproduct per year.&nbsp; LeafGuard USA agreed to pay Englert royalties on at\r\nleast 15,000 feet per year, regardless of whether they met the quota.&nbsp; The\r\ncontract contained the following language regarding termination:\r\n\r\n  The term of this Agreement shall\r\n  initially be for a two-year period from January 1, 1999 through December 31,\r\n  2000 . . . and shall, if Licensee has materially complied with all of the\r\n  provisions of this License, continue in full force and effect for additional\r\n  one year periods thereafter, unless either party, upon 30 days written notice\r\n  to the other party . . . elects to terminate this Agreement.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  Should Sub-Licensee be in default\r\n  on its payment obligations to Englert for 60 days, Englert may, at its option,\r\n  terminate this license immediately and/or seek any other options open to\r\n  Englert, including taking over or repossessing Sub-Licenseeâ€™s Englert\r\n  LeafGuard Gutter Machine . . . .\r\n\r\nAccording to Englert, the total\r\nfootage of product ordered by LeafGuard USA in 2000 was 3,940 feet, which was\r\n11,060 feet short of LeafGuard USAâ€™s contractual sales target and obligatory\r\nroyalty payments.&nbsp; Englert claims no royalties were paid on the 2000\r\nshortfall.&nbsp; On March 15, 2001, Englert faxed Vickory a letter notifying\r\nLeafGuard USA that Englert was terminating its sub-licensing agreement pursuant\r\nto the contractual language quoted above.&nbsp; Englert sought to exercise its\r\ncontractual buy-back option regarding the Machine, which, after over six years\r\nof possession, was valued at $1.00 according to the depreciation schedule agreed\r\nupon in both the 1993 and 1999 contracts.[3]&nbsp;\r\nLeafGuard USA refused to return the Machine and, in July 2001, Englert commenced\r\nthe present action seeking its immediate possession and monetary damages.&nbsp;\r\nOn June 17, 2002, the circuit court\r\ndenied a preliminary motion by Englert for possession of the Machine, ruling\r\nthat LeafGuard USA was entitled to its possession until a decision on the\r\nmerits.&nbsp; In March 2003, Englert filed an amended complaint, which added an\r\nadditional cause of action.&nbsp; LeafGuard USA answered the amended complaint,\r\nasserting several affirmative defenses as well as counterclaims for violations\r\nof South Carolinaâ€™s Unfair Trade Practices Act, breach of contract, and fraud,\r\ninter alia.&nbsp; Englert then filed motions for 1) summary\r\njudgment on the issue of the Machineâ€™s possession, 2) dismissal of LeafGuard\r\nUSAâ€™s counterclaims, and 3) temporary injunctive relief.&nbsp; After\r\nconsideration of submitted materials from both parties, the circuit court\r\nrefused to dismiss LeafGuard USAâ€™s counterclaims and denied Englertâ€™s\r\nrequested injunctive relief.&nbsp; Englertâ€™s motion for partial summary\r\njudgment, however, was granted.&nbsp; The circuit court found no issue of fact\r\nas to the contractâ€™s termination and that the contractâ€™s unambiguous terms\r\nallowed Englert to repurchase the Machine upon termination of the partiesâ€™\r\nrelationship.&nbsp; Accordingly, it ordered LeafGuard USA to sell the Machine to\r\nEnglert for the agreed upon price of $1.00.&nbsp; LeafGuard USAâ€™s subsequent\r\nmotion for reconsideration was denied.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment\r\nis to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact\r\nfinder.â€&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874\r\n(2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court\r\napplies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP:\r\nsummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\nfact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming\r\nv. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).&nbsp;\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nLeafGuard USA bases its argument on\r\nappeal on the spurious corporate formality that it was Seamless Gutters who\r\ninitially purchased the Machine and not LeafGuard USA.&nbsp; It contends that\r\nLeafGuard USA owns no gutter-fabricating machine; thus, the relief granted to\r\nEnglert was erroneous because Seamless Gutters is not a named party in the\r\npresent lawsuit.&nbsp; We are not persuaded by this argument.\r\nWe begin with restating the basic\r\nfact of this case that Vickory incorporated LeafGuard as a direct result of\r\nSeamless Gutters 1993 contract with Englert.&nbsp; The corporate name itself\r\nmakes use of the Englert brand name â€œLeafGuardâ€ and, from the corporationâ€™s\r\ninception until 1999, it functioned wholly under the rights granted it from the\r\n1993 agreement between Seamless Gutters and Englert.&nbsp; Adoption of the\r\nposition that Seamless Gutters and LeafGuard USA are completely distinguishable\r\nentities, alike â€œonly in ownership,â€ not only ignores the readily apparent\r\nfacts of this case, but also exposes LeafGuard USA, when viewed as a separate\r\nentity, to possible liability for over five years of trademark and patent\r\ninfringement.&nbsp; If LeafGuard USA was conveyed no possessory right in the\r\nMachine by the 1993 contract, neither was it conveyed the right to manufacture,\r\nsell, and install the Englert LeafGuard gutter system or to make use of the\r\nEnglert brand names and trademarks, which the company most certainly did from\r\n1994 to 1999.\r\nDespite Vickoryâ€™s vague assertions\r\nto the contrary,[4] the fact that\r\nLeafGuard USA currently possesses the Machine and that it and Seamless Gutters\r\nare essentially the same entity is acknowledged throughout the record.&nbsp; For\r\nexample, in its answer to Englertâ€™s amended complaint, LeafGuard USA stated,\r\nâ€œthe value of the gutter machine rightfully owned and possessed by [LeafGuard\r\nUSA] exceeds Ten Thousand and 00/100 (10,000.00) Dollars.â€ (emphasis\r\nadded).&nbsp; Similarly, although Seamless Gutters was the listed party to the\r\n1993 contract, LeafGuard USA states in its appellate brief that the 1999\r\ncontract â€œserved to continue the territory of the franchise sold under the\r\n1993 agreement.â€&nbsp; In his 2003 deposition, Vickory testified he had been\r\nthe vice president and owner of LeafGuard USA for approximately twenty years,\r\neven though prior to 1994 the business only existed as Seamless Gutters.&nbsp;\r\nLeafGuard USAâ€™s arguments on appeal and below, which assert simultaneously\r\nthat LeafGuard USA owns no gutter-fabricating machine, yet the act of\r\nrepossessing its gutter-fabricating machine would destroy the business, also\r\nreflect this inconsistency.\r\nIn 1992, this court, faced with very\r\nsimilar arguments heavily relying on corporate technicalities, held as follows:\r\n\r\n  A corporation may be known by\r\n  several names in the transaction of its business.&nbsp; If it is sued in a\r\n  name under which it transacts business, the process will ordinarily be\r\n  sufficient to bring it before the court.&nbsp; The misnomer of a corporation\r\n  has the same effect as the misnomer of an individual.&nbsp; If it later\r\n  appears that the true name of the corporation is different from the name under\r\n  which it was sued, the misnomer is properly a subject of amendment.&nbsp;\r\n  However, failure to correct the corporate name does not invalidate the process\r\n  or the judgment where the misnomer causes the corporation no prejudice.\r\n\r\nGriffon v. Capital Cash, 310\r\nS.C. 288, 292, 423 S.E.2d 143, 146 (Ct. App. 1992) (internal citations\r\nomitted).&nbsp; Accompanying this statement of law, the court included the\r\nfollowing chiding remarks, which we believe worth repeating here:\r\n\r\n  A suit at law is not a childrenâ€™s\r\n  game, but a serious effort on the part of adult human beings to administer\r\n  justice; and the purpose of process is to bring parties into court.&nbsp; If\r\n  it names them in such terms that every intelligent person understands who is\r\n  meant, as is the case here, it has fulfilled its purpose; and courts should\r\n  not put themselves in the position of failing to recognize what is apparent to\r\n  everyone else.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nIn the present case, the parties to\r\nboth the 1993 and 1999 contracts were the same, save for Vickoryâ€™s use of a\r\ndifferent corporate name.&nbsp; The record clearly reflects that the parties\r\nwere aware that LeafGuard USA was using the same gutter-fabricating machine sold\r\nto Seamless Gutters in 1993 and that they considered the 1998 agreement a\r\ncontinuation of the prior contract.&nbsp; We find no prejudice to the appealing\r\ncompany, whether called Seamless Gutters or LeafGuard USA, in Englertâ€™s\r\nfailure to employ all of its corporate designations in the present\r\nlawsuit.&nbsp; LeafGuard USA, who is admittedly in possession of the Machine, is\r\ntherefore required, under the unambiguous terms of the 1993 and 1999 contracts\r\nand regardless of the future success of its counterclaims, to sell the Machine\r\nto Englert for the agreed upon price.[5]\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the\r\ncircuit courtâ€™s grant of partial summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n[2] The 1993 contract granted Seamless Gutters the right to use\r\nEnglertâ€™s trademarks, namely the â€œLeafGuardâ€ brand name, in association\r\nwith the sale of its gutter system.\r\n[3] LeafGuard USA believes the Machineâ€™s current value to be\r\napproximately $10,000, but offers no evidence supporting this assertion.\r\n[4] Vickory stated that, although both companies install gutters, â€œ[o]ne\r\nis LeafGuard and one is not a LeafGuard.â€\r\n[5] Because the trial court\r\ngranted summary judgment only as to the repurchase of the Machine, the other\r\nissues LeafGuard USA argues on appeal have yet to be ruled upon by the trial\r\ncourt; thus, we do not address them here.&nbsp; See Lucas v. Rawl\r\nFamily Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œ[A]n\r\nappellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the trial court.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4021","title":"DSS v.

[1] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn July 19, 2001, the Department of\r\nSocial Services (DSS) took the children into emergency protective custody under\r\nan ex parte order.&nbsp; The family court subsequently issued a\r\nformal order of removal, which included Phillipsâ€™ stipulation that she\r\nphysically neglected her children and that Brea had been sexually abused by an unknown\r\nperpetrator.&nbsp; The family court also approved an agreed-upon treatment and\r\nplacement plan for reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following a judicial review\r\nhearing in July 2002, the family court returned the children to Phillips.&nbsp;\r\nThe family court order required Phillips to continue compliance with the\r\ntreatment plan and imposed a continuing obligation on DSS and the guardian ad\r\nlitem to monitor the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe children were again removed from\r\nPhillipsâ€™ custody in December 2002.&nbsp; The family court granted removal\r\nbecause â€œreturning the minor children to the home of the Defendant Sheila\r\nPhillips would . . . be contrary to the welfare and best interests of the minor\r\nchildren.â€&nbsp; The parties agreed to a second treatment and placement plan\r\nfor reunification.&nbsp; The family court also ordered Phillips to pay a weekly\r\nchild support obligation for Brea and\r\ntransfer Mick and Shonnaâ€™s social security checks to DSS.\r\nDSS eventually filed for termination\r\nof parental rights.&nbsp; Following the December 2003 hearing, the family court\r\nterminated Phillipsâ€™ parental rights as to Mick and Brea,\r\nbut denied termination of Phillipsâ€™ rights as to Shonna.[2]&nbsp; This appeal\r\nfollowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn a termination of parental\r\nrights (TPR) case, the best interests of the children are the paramount\r\nconsideration.â€&nbsp; Doe v.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp.\r\n2004) (emphasis added).&nbsp; Phillips argues there was an insufficient basis\r\nfor the family courtâ€™s determination as to all three of these findings.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.&nbsp; For the reasons set out below, we find there is clear and\r\nconvincing evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding that Phillips failed\r\nto adequately remedy the conditions which caused the removal.&nbsp; Because our\r\naffirmance of this finding constitutes a sufficient statutory ground for\r\ntermination, we need not reach the family courtâ€™s additional finding\r\nconcerning Phillipsâ€™ failure to support Brea.&nbsp; We further find clear and\r\nconvincing evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding that termination was\r\nin the best interest of the children.\r\nI.&nbsp; Failure to Remedy\r\nConditions\r\nPhillips raises two specific\r\narguments in claiming the family court erred in finding she failed to remedy the\r\nconditions that caused the removal of Mick and Brea.&nbsp; First, she claims the\r\nfamily courtâ€™s February 5, 2003, Order for Removal was unenforceable because\r\nit failed to set forth the conditions which caused the removal and failed to\r\ninclude necessary information regarding the treatment plan as required by\r\nstatute.&nbsp; Second, Phillips claims that, even if the order were enforceable,\r\nshe had effectively remedied the conditions DSS asserted as the cause for\r\nremoval.&nbsp; We address these arguments separately below, finding neither\r\nmeritorious.\r\n\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sufficiency of the Order for Removal\r\n\r\nWe reject Phillipsâ€™ challenge to\r\nthe sufficiency of the family courtâ€™s February 5, 2003, Order for Removal,\r\nfinding: (1) the challenge is procedurally barred, and (2) in any event, the\r\norder complied with the prescribed statutory requirements in all necessary\r\nparticulars.&nbsp;\r\nFirst, we note that Phillipsâ€™\r\nargument concerning the sufficiency of the removal order is procedurally barred\r\nas untimely.&nbsp; After the Order for Removal was filed by the family court,\r\nPhillips raised no objection to the treatment plan it set out or any of its\r\nother findings.&nbsp; Phillips, in fact, consented to the plan.&nbsp; Once the\r\nfamily court has conducted a merits hearing and ordered a treatment plan,\r\nfailure to object to the sufficiency of a plan or the process by which a plan\r\nwas developed waives the right to raise such an objection in a subsequent\r\ntermination of parental rights action.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-764(H)\r\n(Supp. 2004) (providing that â€œ[f]ailure to request a hearing or to enter an\r\nobjection at the hearing constitutes a waiver of the objectionâ€ and that â€œ[t]he\r\nsufficiency of the plan or of the process for developing the plan may not be\r\nraised as an issue in a proceeding for termination of parental rights . . .â€);\r\nsee also Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 291, 513 S.E.2d\r\n358, 364 (1999) (noting that â€œany order issued as a result of a merit hearing,\r\nas well as any later order issued with regard to a treatment, placement, or\r\npermanent plan, is a final order that a party must timely appealâ€).&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, Phillips has waived her right to object to the sufficiency of the\r\nOrder for Removal in the present appeal.\r\nSecond, even if this challenge were\r\nproperly before us on the merits, we find the Order for Removal satisfied the\r\nstatutory requirements and was therefore fully enforceable.&nbsp; In the present\r\ncaseâ€”as is typicalâ€”the Order for Removal included a placement and treatment\r\nplan designed to aid in the reunification of the parent and children.&nbsp; The\r\nformulation and adoption of these plans are governed by South Carolina Code\r\nsection 20-7-764 (Supp. 2004). â€œThe placement plan shall include, but is not\r\nlimited to . . . the specific reasons for removal of the child from the custody\r\nof the parent or guardian and the changes that must be made before the child may\r\nbe returned . . . .â€&nbsp; Â§ 20-7-764(B)(1).&nbsp; The placement plan should\r\nalso include â€œthe financial responsibilities and obligations, if any, of the\r\nparents or guardian for the support of the child during the placement.â€ Â§\r\n20-7-764(B)(4).&nbsp; Finally, the placement plan â€œshall state the conditions\r\nnecessary to bring about return of the child and the reasonable efforts that\r\nwill be made by the department to reunite the child with the childâ€™s family.â€&nbsp;\r\nÂ§ 20-7-764(C).&nbsp;\r\nWe find the removal order\r\nsufficiently complied with the requirements set forth by section 20-7-764.&nbsp;\r\nThe children were removed from the home because Phillips stipulated to abuse and\r\nneglect of the children, and the guardian ad litem recommended the\r\nremoval.&nbsp; According to the plan, Phillips had to cooperate with counseling\r\nuntil released by her counselor, obtain an assessment and complete any\r\nrecommended drug programs, refrain from using illegal drugs and from abusing\r\nalcohol, submit to random drug and alcohol screens, submit to an evaluation to\r\naddress her ability to obtain employment, transfer Shonna and Mickâ€™s social\r\nsecurity benefit checks to DSS, and pay child support for Brea in the amount of\r\n$15 per week.&nbsp; The family court was principally concerned with Phillipsâ€™\r\ndrug use, need for counseling, and employment.[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Phillipsâ€™ Failure to Correct the Conditions that Warranted the Childrenâ€™s Initial Removal\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the substance of the\r\nfamily courtâ€™s finding that Phillips failed to remedy the conditions that\r\ncaused the removal of Mick and Brea. As set out above, section 20-7-1572(2)\r\nprovides for termination of parental rights if â€œ[t]he child has been removed\r\nfrom the parent . . . has been out of the home for a period of six months\r\nfollowing the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement\r\nbetween the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the\r\nconditions which caused the removal.â€&nbsp; (emphasis added).&nbsp; â€œ[T]he\r\nstatute allows for termination of parental rights where the parent has not\r\nremedied the conditions causing removal.&nbsp; This does not suggest that an\r\nattempt to remedy alone is adequate to preserve parental rights.&nbsp;\r\nOtherwise, the statute would be couched in such terms. The attempt must have, in\r\nfact, remedied the conditions.â€&nbsp; Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Pritchett,\r\n296 S.C. 517, 520, 374 S.E.2d 500, 501 (Ct. App. 1988) (emphasis in\r\noriginal).&nbsp;\r\nWe recognize that Phillips showed\r\nsome progress in her treatment plan, but she fell short in actually remedying\r\nthe conditions causing the removal, namely ending her drug use, continuing\r\ncounseling, and finding employment.&nbsp; Phillips tested positive for\r\nmethamphetamines in December 2002. &nbsp;She also refused to take the\r\ndrug screens offered in March and April 2003, which constituted positive drug\r\nscreens according to the court order.&nbsp; Phillips tested positive for opiates\r\nat the methadone drug clinic in May 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once she consented\r\nto a DSS drug test that same May, she tested positive for cocaine.&nbsp;\r\nSignificantly, despite her ongoing battle with the drugs, Phillips failed to\r\nseek treatment until May 2003, three months after the removal order.&nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, she did not seek alcohol and drug counseling until July 2003,\r\nnearly five months after the removal order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nConcerning the counseling\r\nrequirement, although Phillips cooperated initially, she discontinued her\r\ncounseling sessions in October 2003.&nbsp; As of the date of the termination\r\nhearing, Phillips had still not resumed counseling, thereby failing to\r\nsuccessfully complete her counseling as required by the placement plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTurning to the issue of\r\nPhillipsâ€™ employment, despite the family courtâ€™s admonishment for her to\r\nseek an evaluation for employability, Phillips failed to do so.&nbsp; Phillips\r\nbegan the GED program, waiting until two months prior to the termination hearing\r\nto do so.&nbsp; At the time of the termination hearing, she apparently had no\r\nincome, although the record demonstrates she was capable of regular\r\nemployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn sum, Phillips failed to\r\nmeaningfully address her drug addiction problem over an extended period of\r\ntime.&nbsp; In addition, her efforts at remaining in counseling and finding\r\nemployment were spotty and ineffective.&nbsp; Therefore, we find clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that Phillips failed to remedy the conditions that caused\r\nthe removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Best Interest of the\r\nChildren\r\nPhillips claims the family court\r\nerred in finding clear and convincing evidence that termination of her parental\r\nrights was in the best interest of Mick and Brea.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAssuming that the asserted\r\ntermination ground enumerated within section 20-7-1572 has been established, the\r\nfamily court must also make a finding that the termination of parental rights is\r\nin the best interest of the child. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2004) (â€œThe\r\nfamily court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one\r\nor more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best\r\ninterest of the child. . . .â€).&nbsp; Our supreme court has emphasized the\r\ncourts of this state have for many years, consistent with the expressed desire\r\nof our Legislature, decided â€œall matters involving the custody or care of\r\nchildren in â€˜light of the fundamental principle that the controlling\r\nconsideration is the best interests of the child.â€™â€&nbsp; Hooper, 334\r\nS.C. at 295, 513 S.E.2d at 366 (quoting In Re Doran, 129 S.C. 26, 31, 123\r\nS.E. 501, 503 (1924)).&nbsp;\r\nBrenda Lipe, an expert in the field\r\nof child therapy, testified that continued contact between the children and\r\nPhillips would not be in the childrenâ€™s best interest.&nbsp; She also\r\ntestified Brea was exposed to inappropriate sexual behaviors between Phillips\r\nand Ray Berry when Brea and Mick returned home in July 2002.&nbsp; This is of\r\nparticular concern because the family court had strictly prohibited contact\r\nbetween the children and Berry in a previous order.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guardian ad\r\nlitem and Phillips confirmed violation of this provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brea\r\nthen acted this sexual behavior out with another child in her foster home.&nbsp;\r\nSignificantly, according to Lipe,\r\nâ€œ[t]herapeutically, [the children] are wonderful.&nbsp; They are\r\nflourishing.&nbsp; They are thriving.â€&nbsp; Mickâ€™s grades have drastically\r\nimproved, and â€œ[h]e is less anxious and withdrawn.â€&nbsp; Lipe stated that\r\nMick was always â€œwithdrawn and sullenâ€ after visiting with his mother,\r\nanxieties that arose again shortly before the termination hearing because Mick\r\nwas concerned â€œhe was going to have to go home.â€&nbsp; In Lipeâ€™s expert\r\nopinion, returning the two children to Phillips â€œwould devastate them.â€&nbsp;\r\nThe guardian ad litem also\r\nrecommended termination of Phillipsâ€™ parental rights as to Mick and\r\nBrea.&nbsp; The guardian was specifically concerned with Phillipsâ€™ failure to\r\nwork on her treatment plan for drug abuse and pay child support.&nbsp; She\r\ntestified that while Brea and Mick â€œlove [Phillips] as a mother and recognize\r\nher as their mother, . . . their family now is with the Browns.â€&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe termination of parental rights\r\nis often a difficult and unpleasant process and experience for all concerned,\r\nand this case is no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp; In undertaking this unenviable task,\r\nour courts face competing, yet mutually vital considerations.&nbsp; On the one\r\nhand, we must seek to uphold the Legislatureâ€™s express public policy that\r\nchildren be reunited with their parents whenever possible. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 20-7-20(D) (1985) (providing that â€œ[i]t is the policy of this State to\r\nreunite the child with his family in a timely manner, whether or not the child\r\nhas been placed in the care of the State voluntarilyâ€); Hooper, 334\r\nS.C. at 296, 513 S.E.2d at 366 (noting â€œ[t]he public policy of this state in\r\nchild custody matters is to reunite parents and childrenâ€).&nbsp; This policy\r\ngoal stems from the recognition that the interest of the natural parents in the\r\ncare and nurture of their child does not vanish simply because they have been\r\nless than model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the\r\nState.&nbsp; Yet, this desire to preserve the natural family bond must be\r\nbalanced by the always paramountâ€”â€œcontrollingâ€â€”concern that the best\r\ninterest of the child be protected and advanced.&nbsp; In this case, the\r\npreference for family reunification must give way to the clear and convincing\r\nevidence that the best interests of the children are served by terminating\r\nPhillipsâ€™ parental rights to Mick and Brea.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Phillips failed to remedy\r\nthe conditions set out by the placement plan in the February 2003 removal order\r\nand find the best interests of the children are served by terminating her\r\nparental rights.&nbsp; Because these findings are sufficient to uphold the\r\nfamily courtâ€™s order, we do not reach Phillipsâ€™ additional assignment of\r\nerror concerning the family courtâ€™s finding she willfully failed to support\r\nBrea.&nbsp; Therefore, the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate Phillipsâ€™\r\nparental rights as to Mick and Brea is\r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Breaâ€™s father is Ray Berry, who was a co-defendant in the\r\nunderlying action, but Berry was in default and did not appeal the family courtâ€™s\r\ndecision as to termination of his parental rights.&nbsp; The biological father\r\nof Mick and Shonna is deceased.&nbsp;\r\n[2] The family court did not terminate Phillipsâ€™ parental rights as\r\nto Shonna because she was 17 years old at the time of the order and did not want\r\nto be adopted.&nbsp; The guardian ad litem did not recommend termination in\r\nconnection with Shonna.&nbsp;\r\n[3] These are the same concerns echoed by the family court in the\r\nearlier April 2002 order for removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4022","title":"Widdicombe v.

Tucker-Cales (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s denial of her motion for relief from judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis child custody case has a tortured procedural history.Â  On December 15, 1995, the family court approved a settlement agreement between Robert Widdicombe (Father) and Mother, which addressed the custody of their minor child, a son born October 22, 1993.Â  The settlement agreement provided that Mother would have custody and Father would have standard visitation.Â  It also provided that neither party could take the child out of the jurisdiction without providing the other party 60 daysâ€™ notice.Â  \r\nOn August 22, 2000, Father, who had remarried and moved to Illinois, filed a summons and complaint in South Carolina seeking custody of his son.Â  The complaint alleged, among other things, that Mother moved numerous times without notifying Father.Â  The complaint also alleged that Motherâ€™s last known address was in South Carolina, but her present whereabouts were unknown.Â  \r\nIn an affidavit attached to the complaint, Father recounted his longstanding hardships in locating and communicating with Mother and his son.Â  He claimed he knew Mother and child were living in North Carolina, but for several years the only dependable way to get in touch with Mother was to withhold her support payments until she phoned.Â  In 1998, according to Father, Mother dropped the child off at his home, claiming she would return the following morning.Â  Mother did not return for two and a half weeks, and the childâ€™s maternal grandmother eventually picked him up.Â  From 1998 to 2000, Father learned several disturbing facts regarding Mother and his son, including allegations that Mother was on probation for passing fraudulent checks and was involved in an abusive bigamous marriage.Â  He became increasingly concerned when, in June 2000, Motherâ€™s probation officer notified him that Motherâ€™s whereabouts were unknown.Â  Father then received a telephone call from the childâ€™s maternal grandmother informing him that Mother was living with her in South Carolina and he should send the child support payments there.Â  A safety check performed by local police on August 2, 2000, confirmed that Mother and the child were in fact residing at the grandmotherâ€™s home.Â  Shortly thereafter, Father learned from Motherâ€™s probation officer that Mother was back in North Carolina and the child was not enrolled in school.Â  The maternal grandmother continued to claim that Mother and the child were in South Carolina.Â  On August 16, however, Father learned with certainty that Mother and the child were in a shelter in North Carolina and that the child was hungry and sick.Â  Shelter records indicate Mother moved into the shelter on August 3, 2000, one day after the police performed the safety check.Â  School records from North Carolina indicate the child was enrolled for ten days in August of 2000. \r\nFrom August 17 to August 31, 2000, Father left a series of voice mail messages on the maternal grandmotherâ€™s answering machine.Â  These messages indicate Father left Illinois and traveled to South Carolina to appear before the South Carolina family court.Â  \r\nOn August 28, 2000, the family court issued an ex parte order granting Father immediate legal and physical custody of the child.Â  This order was based on allegations in Fatherâ€™s affidavit discussed above.Â  He picked up the child from a North Carolina day care center promptly after obtaining emergency custody and returned to Illinois.Â  \r\nMother filed an answer and counterclaim to Fatherâ€™s motion for emergency relief in the South Carolina family court on November 11, 2000.Â  Mother stated she moved to North Carolina in 1998 and returned to South Carolina in August 2000.Â  Shortly thereafter, she moved back to North Carolina into a battered womenâ€™s shelter.Â  Importantly, Mother asserted that, despite her many relocations, the South Carolina family court had jurisdiction because she was a resident of Charleston County, South Carolina, and had been so for over one year.Â Â Â  She admitted Fatherâ€™s allegations of being in a bigamous marriage, being investigated by social services in North Carolina, and being on probation for writing fraudulent checks.Â  Mother demanded a hearing and sought full custody of the child.Â  \r\nOn February 15, 2001, the family court issued a consent order granting temporary custody to Father.[2]Â  On August 1, 2001, the family court struck the case from the active roster pursuant to the 270-day rule, leaving the temporary order in effect.Â  On August 15, counsel for Father submitted an order restoring the case to the active roster, but the court did not sign the order.Â  On November 27, Mother filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction due to the fact that neither the child nor either parent was a resident of South Carolina on the date of the ex parte order.Â  Mother then filed a motion to relieve counsel on the alleged grounds that her attorney knowingly made false statements in documents filed with the court and entered into consent orders without consulting with her. \r\nThe family court denied Motherâ€™s motion to dismiss, concluding that South Carolina has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction based on the 1995 custody order and Motherâ€™s residency in this state for more than one year.Â  The family court also noted that no litigation was pending in any other state regarding custody of the child.Â  Additionally, the family court denied Motherâ€™s motion to change custody because exigent circumstances did not exist warranting a change in custody.Â  The order provided that the temporary consent order of February 15, 2001 was to remain in effect.Â Â  \r\nMother filed a motion to reconsider on January 22, 2002, arguing again that because neither of the parents nor the child lived in South Carolina at the time Fatherâ€™s action was filed, the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  After a hearing, the family court denied the motion to reconsider.Â  The family court found that Mother submitted herself to the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction, and the case had continued without objection from Mother for over a year before she filed the motion to dismiss.Â  Father was awarded $562.50 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nMother appealed to this court.Â  On November 18, 2002, Fatherâ€™s motion to dismiss the appeal was granted on the ground that the appeal was interlocutory.Â  Motherâ€™s subsequent writs of prohibition and mandamus were dismissed in June 2003.Â  \r\nOn January 6, 2004, Mother filed an expedited motion for relief from judgment in the family court, again alleging the case was void ab initio for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The family court denied Motherâ€™s motion, finding that no final order had yet been issued in the case, and further found that the motion was not timely brought within the one-year statute of limitations.Â  The family court reaffirmed that it had jurisdiction and awarded Father $775 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â  \r\nMother then filed a motion to reconsider, limiting her request to only two issues:Â  (1) whether the family court had jurisdiction at the commencement of the case; and (2) whether the family court failed to consider all the factors required by law in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees in that it did not consider her financial condition.Â  Mother alleged in her supporting affidavit that she moved to North Carolina in 1998 and was still living there when Fatherâ€™s complaint was filed.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s motion on March 11, 2004.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has authority to determine facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This court, however, is not required to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, nor should we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their testimony.Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 453, 486 S.E.2d 516, 519 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Interlocutory Appeal\r\nWe must first address Fatherâ€™s argument that this court lacks jurisdiction because the orders appealed from are interlocutory.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004) sets forth the requirements for appellate jurisdiction and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n[Appellate courts] shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n(2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action . . . .\r\n\r\nMatters involving the custody of oneâ€™s child certainly constitute a â€œsubstantial rightâ€ as contemplated in the South Carolina statute. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753-54 (1982) (holding that parenting is a fundamental constitutional right and due process is mandatory when such a right is jeopardized).Â  Much of the delay in receiving a final custody hearing can be attributed to Motherâ€™s failure to request that the case be restored to the active roster or file a new case seeking modification of custody.Â  Nevertheless, the record reveals that although the emergency order temporarily changing custody, the temporary consent order, and the subsequent motion rulings are not true final orders, they are certainly being treated as such by the family court.Â  The family courtâ€™s order of January 15, 2002, reads, â€œ[t]he prior Temporary Order of the Court of February 15, 2001 . . . not modified herein shall remain in full force and effect.â€Â  Although the family courtâ€™s January 6, 2004, order denied relief under Rule 60, SCRCP, on the basis that there was no final order in the case, it noted that the case had been stricken from the active roster for over three years and reflected no intention to have the case restored.Â  \r\nUnder the unique factual circumstances of the present case, we conclude the family court orders have the practical effect of a final order affecting Motherâ€™s substantial rights.[3]Â  In any event, the issues raised by Mother on appeal have been the subject of much contention in this case.Â  They will inevitably be raised to the family court again in the future and, because they have been fully briefed by the parties, we find that it would be in the interest of judicial economy to decide the matters now.Â  See Southern Bell Tel. and Tel. Co. v. Hamm, 306 S.C. 70, 75, 409 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1991) (deciding an issue on appeal in the interests of judicial economy).Â  Accordingly, we move on to the merits of Motherâ€™s appeal.\r\nII. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nMotherâ€™s argument on appeal, as well as before the family court in several of her prior motion hearings, is that the South Carolina family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order the emergency change in custody.Â  Specifically, she contends that the South Carolina did not have continuing jurisdiction under the provisions of the controlling Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-782 to 830 (1985) (â€œUCCJAâ€) and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A (1988) (â€œPKPAâ€).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe two statutes in question govern the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts to rule in interstate custody disputes.Â  See, e.g., Foley v. Foley, 576 S.E.2d 383, 385 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003); In re Jorgensen, 627 N.W.2d 550, 554 (Iowa 2001).Â  Because the PKPA is federal legislation, its provisions will govern any conflict between it and the UCCJA (South Carolinaâ€™s jurisdictional statute for interstate custody decrees).Â  See Schwartz v. Schwartz, 311 S.C. 303, 307-308, 428 S.E.2d 748, 750-51 (Ct. App. 1993); Marks v. Marks, 281 S.C. 316, 320-21, 315 S.E.2d 158, 160-61 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nThe provisions of the PKPA applicable to the present case are contained in subsection (d) of 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A, which deals with continuing jurisdiction and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n(d) The jurisdiction of a court of a State which has made a child custody determination consistently with the provisions of this section continues as long as the requirement of subsection (c)(1) of this section continues to be met and such State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.\r\n\r\nSubsection (c)(1), mentioned in the quote above, requires that the family court maintain jurisdiction under its own state law.Â  Therefore, â€œ[s]ubsection (d) basically sets forth three criteria, all of which must be met, for a court to retain [continuing] jurisdictionâ€ under the PKPA. Dahlen v. Dahlen, 393 N.W.2d 765, 768 (N.D. 1986).Â  The three criteria are 1) that the original custody determination was entered consistently with the provisions of the PKPA; 2) that the court maintain jurisdiction under its own state law (in South Carolina, the UCCJA); and 3) that the state remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.Â  See id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the first criterion is undisputed.Â  The child and both parties to the action were South Carolina residents at the time of the initial custody decree and, suffice it to say, the jurisdictional requirements of both the PKPA and the UCCJA were certainly satisfied at that time.\r\nThe second requirement, that jurisdiction under South Carolina law be maintained, is a more complex matter.Â  In 1981, South Carolina adopted the UCCJA as its governing law in interstate custody disputes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-782 to 830 (1985).Â  The applicable portion of the UCCJA regarding jurisdiction reads as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) A court of this State which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if:\r\n(2) it is in the best interest of the child that a court of this State assume jurisdiction because (i) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with this State and (ii) there is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (1985).\r\nThe purpose of the UCCJA is to prevent conflicting custody decrees between different states.Â  See Kirylik v. Kirylik, 292 S.C. 475, 477, 357 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1987).Â  To this end, much deference is given to the jurisdiction of the state that initially rules on a custody matter.Â  â€œCourts which render a custody decree normally retain continuing jurisdiction to modify the decree under local law.â€ Knoth v. Knoth, 297 S.C. 460, 463, 377 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1989).Â  Once a custody decree has been entered, the decree state has exclusive continuing jurisdiction, which is not necessarily affected by a childâ€™s residence in another state.Â  Id. at 464, 377 S.E.2d at 342-43.Â  Accordingly, the UCCJAâ€™s jurisdictional language quoted above has been interpreted broadly when a state seeks to exercise continuing jurisdiction over a pre-existing custody decree.Â  A court may exercise continuing jurisdiction under this subsection when â€œthere are sufficient contacts with the child and his parent(s) to justify legitimate state interest in the outcome of the dispute, and if sufficient evidence is available to enable the court to make a fair determination of custody based upon the best interest of the child.â€Â  Cullen v. Prescott, 302 S.C. 201, 206, 394 S.E.2d 722, 725 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nPursuant to the broad deference given to the state that initially enters a custody decree, we conclude South Carolina properly asserted continuing jurisdiction under the UCCJA in the present matter.Â  South Carolina issued the original decree and Motherâ€™s last known address at the time Father filed for emergency relief was in this state.Â  Mother stipulated in her counterclaim, filed soon after the emergency change in custody and before any issue as to the courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction arose, that she was a resident of South Carolina.Â  See 24A Am. Jur. 2d Divorce and Separation Â§ 984 (2004) (stating that a party accepts a stateâ€™s jurisdiction under the UCCJA by bringing a modification action in that state). Both Mother and the childâ€™s maternal grandmother made continual assertions to Father that the grandmotherâ€™s South Carolina home was the proper address at which to contact the child at the time Father filed his complaint.Â  Furthermore, no other state sought to exercise jurisdiction in this matter; thus there are no conflicting orders from different states, the problem the UCCJA was established to remedy. Accordingly, we find sufficient contacts between the child, Mother, and South Carolina to justify this stateâ€™s interest in the outcome of the dispute.Â  Although Mother had significant contacts with North Carolina, Father presented sufficient evidence for the South Carolina family court to fairly render a judgment regarding the childâ€™s custody. Because we find that the South Carolina family court had continuing jurisdiction under the UCCJA, the PKPAâ€™s second requirement for continuing jurisdiction is satisfied.\r\nIt is the PKPAâ€™s third requirement for continuing jurisdiction, however, that is by far the most contested issue in this case.Â  Unlike the UCCJA, the PKPA expressly states that at least the child or one of the contestants must remain a resident of the decree state for that state to properly exercise continuing jurisdiction.[4]Â  Mother contends that because, at the time of filing, Father was a resident of Illinois and she and the child were in North Carolina, where the pair had lived sporadically since 1998, the South Carolina family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order an emergency change in custody.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nThroughout the PKPA, initial jurisdictional requirements are discussed in terms of the childâ€™s â€œhome state.â€Â  The term â€œhome stateâ€ is defined in the statute as â€œthe state in which, immediately preceding the time involved, the child lived with his parents, a parent, or a person acting as parent, for at least six consecutive months . . . .â€Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(b)(4) (1988).Â  This language provides a court with clear standards governing its jurisdiction over a custody dispute in which there is no previous custody decree.Â  Such is not the case when courts seek to assert continuing jurisdiction over a pre-existing custody decree.Â  Rather than employing the expressly defined term of â€œhome stateâ€ that is used throughout the statute, the PKPA sets forth a requirement of â€œresidence,â€ a term left undefined in the statute, when discussing a courtâ€™s continuing jurisdiction over custody matters.Â  Because â€œresidenceâ€ is not defined in the statute, the determination of whether a decree state has lost its continuing jurisdiction generally turns on the question of the partiesâ€™ or childâ€™s domicile.Â  Child Custody: When Does State that Issued Previous Custody Determination Have Continuing Jurisdiction under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) or Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A, 83 A.L.R.4th 742 (2004).\r\nIn these matters, domicile is determined by an analysis similar to that required for diversity jurisdiction in federal courts, which involves a determination of intent.Â  Id.Â  â€œDomicile is the place of oneâ€™s true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, to which one has the intention of returning after an absence therefrom.â€Â  32A Am. Jur. 2d Federal Courts Â§ 746 (2004).Â  â€œThe question of a personâ€™s place of residence is largely one of intent to be determined under the facts and circumstances of each case.Â  The act and intent as to domicile, not the duration of the residence, are the determining factors.â€Â  Ferguson v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co. 254 S.C. 235, 238-39, 174 S.E.2d 768, 769 (1970).Â  Generally speaking, a determination of residence or domicile by a trial court will not be overturned on appeal unless there is no evidence to support it.Â  See King v. Moore, 224 S.C. 400, 404, 79 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1953).\r\nIn the present case, the question of Mother and childâ€™s residence is muddled at best.Â  However, for many of the same reasons asserted in the UCCJA analysis above, we conclude Mother was a resident of South Carolina at the time Father filed his complaint.Â  Mother first raised the issue of residency over a year after the caseâ€™s commencement.Â  At that point, the family court needed only to look to Motherâ€™s prior pleadings, filed shortly after the emergency change in custody, for her own assertions that she was â€œa resident of Charleston County, South Carolina where she has lived for over one (1) year;â€ thus, she stated, the family court had â€œjurisdiction of this matter by virtue of its continuing and exclusive jurisdiction.â€[5]Â  Although Mother and child were actually staying in a North Carolina shelter at the time, Mother and the maternal grandmother made several assertions to Father that they intended the grandmotherâ€™s South Carolina home to be the address through which to contact her.Â  The most recent contact with the Mother and child, a safety check performed by local police, confirmed that the pair was living in South Carolina.Â  Though this is a difficult issue, there is certainly evidence in the record supporting the conclusion that Mother intended South Carolina to be her state of residency at the time the emergency action was filed.Â  SeeÂ  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000) (â€œ[An] appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€) (quoting Rule 220(c), SCACR).\r\nMoreover, several state courts have applied the doctrine of unclean hands to jurisdiction under the PKPA and UCCJA.Â  See, e.g., Sams v. Boston, 384 S.E.2d 151,Â  159-62 (W. Va. 1989).Â  Because the purpose of the acts is to deter the unlawful removal of children to other jurisdictions, courts have held that a decree state remains the â€œhome stateâ€ for purposes of the PKPA and the UCCJA for a reasonable period of time when the child has been concealed in another state by one of the parents.Â  See, e.g., id.Â  We see no reason not to apply a similar analysis to the determination of â€œresidencyâ€ under the PKPA.Â Â Â  The original custody order required Mother to provide 60 dayâ€™s notice before taking the child out of the jurisdiction.Â  The record indicates that no such notice was provided; therefore, the childâ€™s location out of state at the time of filing directly violated a South Carolina court order.Â  Because Motherâ€™s behavior closely resembles the conduct the act was intended to prevent, we will not consider her sudden move to North Carolina on the eve of filing, without notice to Father, a change of residence under the PKPA.Â  \r\nBecause we conclude Mother was a resident of South Carolina at the time Father filed his complaint, the PKPAâ€™s third requirement for continuing jurisdiction is satisfied.Â  The South Carolina family court, therefore, had jurisdiction to order the emergency change in custody.\r\nIII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nMother next argues the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees in that it failed to consider her financial condition in determining the award.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. See Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining a reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nThe family court is required to make an independent evaluation of each of the Glasscock factors.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  If it does so, the family courtâ€™s award will be affirmed as long as there is sufficient evidence in the record supporting each factor.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe family court expressly considered each of the Glasscock factors.Â  It specifically found, in reviewing Motherâ€™s motion to reconsider, that she failed to provide the court with evidence of her financial situation on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the award. See Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 605, 510 S.E.2d 722, 726 (Ct. App. 1998)Â  (finding no abuse of discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees when the family court considered the Glasscock factors).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s denial of Motherâ€™s motion is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In January of 2004, Father filed a petition to enroll this order in Illinois to establish Illinois as the proper forum to seek modification of custody.\r\n[3] Fatherâ€™s motion to dismiss this appeal based on its interlocutory nature was recently denied on similar grounds.\r\n[4] As previously stated, when the provisions of the PKPA and the UCCJA conflict, the PKPA controls under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.Â  See Schwartz, 311 S.C. at 307-308, 428 S.E.2d at 750-51.\r\n[5] Although Motherâ€™s attorney filed these pleadings without her signature, a party is generally bound by stipulations made by their counsel.Â  See Sadighi v. Dagnighfekr, 66 F. Supp. 2d 752, 761 (D.S.C. 1999) (citing Hall v. Benefit Assâ€™n of Ry. Employees, 164 S.C. 80, 83, 161 S.E. 867, 868 (1932)) (â€œThe parties to a suit are bound by admissions, made by their attorneys of record, in open court, or elsewhere, touching matters looking to the progress of the trial.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
