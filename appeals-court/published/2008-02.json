Coggiola, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  J.: In this workersâ€™\r\n  compensation case, Ann Thompson (Thompson), mother of deceased employee John\r\n  Michael Harvey (Harvey), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision reversing the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s award of death benefits pursuant to section 42-9-290 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHarvey sustained a work-related injury to his right knee and back on January 12, 2000.Â  As\r\n  a result of his initial injuries, Harvey later claimed an aggravation of a\r\n  pre-existing psychiatric condition.Â  His employer, Cisson Constuction, and its\r\n  carrier, Ohio Casualty (collectively Cisson) admitted the right knee and back\r\n  injuries and provided temporary disability and medical benefits. Â Cisson denied\r\n  aggravation of the pre-existing psychiatric condition.  \r\nA\r\n  plethora of emotional problems, including substance abuse, depression, anxiety,\r\n  suicide attempts, and multiple hospitalizations characterized Harveyâ€™s medical\r\n  history.Â  Previous medical records indicated a diagnosis of bipolar affective\r\n  disorder.Â  Yet, for approximately four or five years prior to his January 12,\r\n  2000 work accident, Harveyâ€™s emotional status was stable; he had not taken any\r\n  medication for depression and had not attempted suicide during that period.Â  In\r\n  his own words, Harvey averred he â€œwas dealing with it pretty good.â€Â   \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  numerous evaluations and medical treatments for his compensable injuries, Harvey continued to experience significant pain.Â  Medications, including Oxycontin, were\r\n  prescribed.Â  Harveyâ€™s injuries, combined with the medications, virtually\r\n  immobilized him.Â  Other than taking care of his personal hygiene and\r\n  occasionally preparing a meal for himself, he was able to do very little.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nHarveyâ€™s treating physician, Dr. David Shallcross, noted that â€œdespite being seen by many\r\n  physicians, we have not found anything seriously wrong with this patient to\r\n  explain his pain.â€Â  Medical examination revealed no signs of neurological\r\n  dysfunction, and Harvey was â€œclear to ambulate without any restrictions.â€Â  Dr.\r\n  Shallcross released Harvey at maximum medical improvement with a 5% whole\r\n  person impairment rating and recommended treatment for his pre-existing\r\n  emotional condition, regardless of his physical status.Â   \r\nHarvey began psychiatric treatment with Dr. Mario Galvarino in April of 2001.Â  Dr.\r\n  Galvarino summarized Harveyâ€™s mental state in his initial evaluation:Â  â€œThis\r\n  individual is sad, apprehensive and does nothing at home.Â  He sleeps.Â  He has\r\n  difficulty.Â  He is very angry, apprehensive, irritable, snappy.Â  Concentration\r\n  and memory are poor.Â  He feels hopeless, helpless, useless and very guilty.Â  He\r\n  feels good-for-nothing and wants to die, but he is not actively suicidal.â€Â  Dr.\r\n  Galvarino opined, â€œ[T]he patientâ€™s depression and manic depression have\r\n  considerably and significantly worsened since his injury.â€Â  In May of 2001, Dr.\r\n  Galvarino advised Harveyâ€™s attorney that the injuries he sustained in the\r\n  â€œon-the-job accident with resulting chronic pain and depression have rendered\r\n  him permanently and totally disabled.â€\r\nOn\r\n  March 4, 2002, Thompson, Harveyâ€™s mother, found him dead from a drug overdose.Â \r\n  Pathologist Brett Woodard reported, â€œ[T]he cause of death was Oxycontin over\r\n  dosage.Â  Based on the number of residual pills and pill debris within the\r\n  stomach and the previous psychiatric history of the deceased, the manner of\r\n  death is suicide.â€  \r\nHarvey had moved in to live with Thompson after breaking up with his girlfriend\r\n  approximately nine months prior to his death. Â Thompson sought death benefits\r\n  under section 42-9-290 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, contending Harveyâ€™s death by suicide was the result of emotional trauma or depression secondary to his\r\n  compensable work accident. Â \r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner found, inter alia,:Â  (1) Harveyâ€™s work\r\n  related injury aggravated his pre-existing psychiatric condition; (2) the\r\n  aggravation of the pre-existing psychiatric condition was compensable; (3)\r\n  Harvey reached maximum medical improvement on May 25, 2001, with an impairment\r\n  rating of 25% loss of use to his back and 20% loss of use to his right leg; (4)\r\n  Harveyâ€™s back and right knee injuries, when combined with the severe\r\n  aggravation of his pre-existing emotional problems, rendered himÂ  totally and\r\n  permanently disabled, pursuant to section 42-9-10; (5) Harveyâ€™s death was the\r\n  result of suicide; and (6) the suicide resulted from and was directly linked to\r\n  Harveyâ€™s severe emotional condition brought on by his compensable injuries.Â  The\r\n  single commissioner awarded Thompson death benefits pursuant to sections\r\n  42-9-140 and 42-9-290, including $2500 for burial expenses.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel affirmed the single commissioner, with the exception of the award for\r\n  burial expenses.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  appeal to the Court of Common Pleas the circuit judge reversed the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s decision as a matter of law, holding: Â â€œCompensation for Claimantâ€™s\r\n  suicide is specifically barred by the plain language of Â§ 42-9-60 because the\r\n  event for which Thompson seeks compensationâ€”Claimantâ€™s death by suicideâ€”was\r\n  occasioned by Claimantâ€™s willful intent to kill himself.â€Â  As an alternate\r\n  ground for reversal, the circuit judge ruled:Â  â€œAs a matter of law, Claimantâ€™s\r\n  intent to kill himself was not negated by a spontaneous or uncontrollable\r\n  impulse, or other mental derangement depriving him of normal judgment negating\r\n  his willful intention;â€ and â€œClaimantâ€™s suicide two years after his work\r\n  related accident is not a â€˜natural consequenceâ€™ flowing from such accident.â€\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDoes section 42-9-60 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code of Laws bar death benefits to the deceased\r\n  employeeâ€™s mother when the cause of Â  death was suicide?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tWas the deceased employeeâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tsuicide the result of spontaneous, impulsive, or instinctive \r\n\t\t\tconduct, without deliberate or formed intention, or without \r\n\t\t\tconscious volition to produce death, thus negating his willful \r\n\t\t\tintent to kill himself?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tWas the employeeâ€™s suicide a \r\n\t\t\tâ€œnatural consequenceâ€ flowing from  his\r\n  original compensable accident?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of a\r\n  decision of the workersâ€™ compensation commission.â€ Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C.\r\n  454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct.

App. 2004).Â  Pursuant to the APA, an\r\n  appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision\r\n  is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Grant\r\n    v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 200, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(Supp. 2006).\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Substantial Evidence Standard\r\nThe judicial review of the Appellate Panelâ€™s factual findings is\r\n  governed by the substantial evidence standard. Â Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368\r\n  S.C. 214, 221, 628 S.E.2d 262, 266 (Ct. App. 2006); Frame v. Resort Servs.,\r\n    Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin v.\r\n      Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 94-95 (Ct. App. 2002); Lockridge\r\n        v. Santens of America, Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001). Â The Appellate Panelâ€™s decision must be affirmed if supported by\r\n  substantial evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C.\r\n  435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Sharpe v. Case\r\n    Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999)). Â A reviewing\r\n  court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d)(e)(Supp. 2006); see also Hall\r\n    v. United Rentals, Inc., 371 S.C. 69, 77, 636 S.E.2d 876, 881 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006). Â However, a reviewing\r\n  court may reverse or modify a decision of the Appellate Panel if the findings,\r\n  inferences, conclusions, or decisions of the panel are â€œclearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(e)(Supp.\r\n  2006); Bass v. Kenco Group,\r\n  366 S.C. 450, 457, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005); Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) affâ€™d 369 S.C. 176, 631 S.E.2d 899 (2006).Â   \r\nIt is\r\n  not within the appellate courtâ€™s province to reverse the Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Etheredge\r\n    v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (citing Hoxit v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 405 S.E.2d 407\r\n  (1991)); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 282, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor\r\n  the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action. Â Pratt\r\n    v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004); Jones\r\n      v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 417, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113 (2003); Brown\r\n        v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 392, 622 S.E.2d 546, 554 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) cert. denied Jan. 2007; Broughton v. South of the Border,\r\n  336 S.C. 488, 495, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The possibility of\r\n  drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\n  administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 160, 519 S.E.2d Â at 105; Smith v. NCCI Inc.,\r\n  369 S.C. 236, 247, 631 S.E.2d 268, 274 (Ct. App. 2006); DuRant v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 707 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).\r\nThe Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Isochem,\r\n  365 S.C. at 468, 617 S.E.2d at 376; Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d\r\n  at 495; Muir, 336 S.C. at 281, 519 S.E.2d at 591.Â  The final\r\n  determination of witness credibility and the weight assigned to the evidence is\r\n  reserved to the Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455,\r\n  535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â  Where\r\n  there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate\r\n  Panel are conclusive.Â  Brown, 366 S.C. at 393, 622 S.E.2d at 554; Etheredge,\r\n  349 S.C. at 455, 562 S.E.2d at 681; see also Mullinax v. Winn Dixie\r\n    Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 435, 458 S.E.2d 76, 78 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œWhere\r\n  the medical evidence conflicts, the findings of fact of the [Appellate Panel]\r\n  are conclusive.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  findings of the Appellate Panel are presumed correct and will be set aside only\r\n  if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Kenco Group, 366 S.C. at 458,\r\n  622 S.E.2d at 581; Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495; Broughton,\r\n  336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.Â  The appellate court is prohibited from\r\n  overturning findings of fact of the Appellate Panel unless there is no\r\n  reasonable probability the facts could be as related by the witness upon whose\r\n  testimony the finding was based. Â Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 611 S.E.2d 297, 301, 363 S.C. 612, 621 (Ct.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5)(d) (Supp. 2006); Porter v. Labor Depot, Â 372 S.C. 560,\r\n  567, 643 S.E.2d 96, 100 (Ct. App. 2007) cert. denied Dec. 2007; Bass\r\n    v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct. App. 2005) cert\r\n      dismissed as improvidently granted Aug. 2007; Pratt v. Morris Roofing,\r\n        Inc., 353 S.C. 339, 344, 577 S.E.2d 475, 477 (Ct. App. 2003) affâ€™d as\r\n          modified 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004).\r\nSection\r\n  14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) vests the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court with â€œappellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in\r\n  law cases . . . .â€Â  Citing both section 14-3-330 and South Carolina Constitution,\r\n  article V, section 5, the Supreme Court has held an appellate court may decide\r\n  novel questions of law with â€œno particular deference to the lower court.â€Â  Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 134, 638 S.E.2d\r\n  650, 656 (2006); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  528, 533 (2000).Â  Section 14-8-200(a) of the South Carolina Code provides the\r\n  Court of Appeals â€œshall apply the same scope of review that the Supreme Court\r\n  would apply in a similar case.â€Â  (Supp. 2006).  \r\nPellucidly,\r\n  an appellate courtâ€™s review of factual findings in a workersâ€™ compensation case\r\n  is governed and controlled by the substantial evidence rule.Â  However, an\r\n  appellate court freely and absolutely reviews a trial courtâ€™s decision\r\n  concerning an issue of law.Â  No passivity or complaisance is owed or given to\r\n  the ruling of the Appellate Panel or circuit judge in this context.Â  The highly\r\n  deferential standards statutorily and universally applied in reviewing issues\r\n  of fact, such as the â€œclearly erroneousâ€ and the â€œmanifest errorâ€ standards,\r\n  have no efficacy in regard to an issue of law.Â  The South Carolina Court of\r\n  Appeals exercises freedom and independence in deciding an issue of law in a\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation case. Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, the standard of review applied is bifurcated.Â  Whether section\r\n  42-9-60 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2006) bars death benefits to\r\n  the deceased employeeâ€™s mother when the cause of death was suicide is a\r\n  question of law.Â  Hence, we review the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling to determine if\r\n  it is affected by an error of law. Â See Creech v. Ducane Co., 320\r\n  S.C. 559, 562, 467 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 1995) (recognizing determination\r\n  of whether a claimant sustained an â€œinjury by accidentâ€ within the meaning of\r\n  the workersâ€™ compensation statute is a matter of law).Â  In addition, when the\r\n  evidence gives rise to but one reasonable inference the question becomes one of\r\n  law for the courts to decide.Â  Kinsey v. Champion Am. Serv. Ctr., 268\r\n  S.C. 177, 181, 232 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1977); Sharpe v. Case Produce Co.,329\r\n  S.C. 534, 545, 495 S.E.2d 790, 795 (Ct. App. 1997) revâ€™d on other grounds. \r\n \r\nMoreover,\r\n  it is well settled that statutory interpretation is a matter of law. Â Catawba\r\n    Indian Tribe of S.C. v.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-60 (Supp. 2006).Â  Cisson contends this provision bars an\r\n  award of death benefits as a matter of law, because Harveyâ€™s suicide was a\r\n  result of his willful intention to kill himself.Â  We agree the strict\r\n  construction of section 42-9-60 bars compensation for death that results from\r\n  â€œthe wilful intentionâ€ of an employee â€œto injure or kill himself.â€Â  Id.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Principles of Statutory Construction\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for\r\n  the court.Â  Univ. of S.

Â \r\nWhen a\r\n  statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for\r\n  statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its\r\n  literal meaning.

App. 2002).Â  \r\n \r\nOur appellate\r\n  courts have steadfastly followed the policy of strictly construing the terms of\r\n  the workersâ€™ compensation statute.Â  When the language of the statutory provision\r\n  is plain and unambiguous, courts have consistently applied its literal\r\n  meaning.Â  See Wigfall, 354 S.C. at 100, 580 S.E.2d at 105; Brown\r\n    v. Bilo, 354 S.C. 436, 581 S.E.2d 836 (2003); Barton v. Higgs, 372\r\n  S.C. at 109, 641 S.E.2d at 39.\r\nIn Wigfall,\r\n  the claimant attempted to extend the rule established in Singleton v. Young\r\n    Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 114 S.E.2d 837 (1960).Â  Under Singleton, an\r\n  employee with one scheduled injury is limited to recovery under section 42-9-30\r\n  alone. Â 354 S.C. at 106, 580 S.E.2d at 103.Â  However, if the claimant\r\n  demonstrates injuries beyond the single scheduled member, he is not limited to\r\n  recovery under section 42-9-30.Â  Id. Â Wigfall sought to establish total\r\n  disability by proving a single scheduled injury caused significant lost earning\r\n  capacity under section 42-9-10.Â  Id. at 107, 580 S.E.2d at 103.Â   \r\nWigfall\r\n  contended inequity resulted from:  \r\n\r\n\tallowing a claimant to establish\r\n  total disability through a single non-scheduled injury plus a loss of earning\r\n  capacity but not allowing a claimant to establish total disability through a\r\n  single scheduled injury plus a significant loss of earning capacity. Â The\r\n  result is an individual with a hernia may obtain total disability by showing\r\n  lost earning capacity, while an individual with a scheduled injury may not\r\n  attain total disability even if he could show the scheduled injury caused the\r\n  claimant to lose his earning capacity.\r\n\r\nId. at 109, 580 S.E.2d at 104-05.Â  Â Â   \r\nThe\r\n  court found Wigfallâ€™s equity argument alluring, but not sufficiently persuasive\r\n  to overcome the mandate that legislative intent is the paramount concern when\r\n  interpreting a statute.Â  Id. at 110, 580 S.E.2d at 104-05.Â  Construing\r\n  the relevant section, the court reasoned:\r\nSection 42-9-30 provides:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn cases included in the following schedule, the disability in\r\n  each case shall be deemed to continue for the period specified and the\r\n  compensation so paid for such injury shall be as specified therein, to wit:\r\n\t\tFor the loss of a leg, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the\r\n  average weekly wages during one hundred ninety-five weeks;\r\n\t\r\n\tThe term â€œshallâ€ in a statute means that the action is mandatory.Â \r\n  A plain reading of the statute is that in cases in which a claimant loses the\r\n  use of a leg, the disability must continue for one hundred ninety-five weeks\r\n  and the compensation must equal sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the\r\n  claimantâ€™s average weekly wages. Â Under such a reading, Wigfall is entitled\r\n  only to the scheduled benefits because he suffers solely from a scheduled\r\n  disability.\r\n\r\nId. at 110-11, 580 S.E.2d at 105 (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Wigfall reflects the courtâ€™s adherence to the principle that\r\n  the language provided in the text of a statute is the best evidence of the legislatureâ€™s\r\n  intent.\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  the court of appeals affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s interpretation of section\r\n  42-1-415 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) in Barton v. Higgs.Â \r\n  372 S.C. at 119, 641 S.E.2d at 44.Â  The dispute involved workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  coverage for employees of Total Homeâ€™s subcontractor, Iyanel.Â  Iyanel presented\r\n  Total Home with an unsigned Certificate of Insurance, representing it had\r\n  obtained workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  The carrierâ€™s agent issued the\r\n  Certificate of Insurance, however, without coverage being bound.Â  Total Home\r\n  sought to transfer liability for an employeeâ€™s injury to the South Carolina\r\n  Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund (Fund)  \r\nbecause it relied\r\n  in good faith on Iyanelâ€™s representation that it had insurance.Â  Id. at 113-14, 641 S.E.2d at 41-42.\r\nThe\r\n  relevant portion of section 42-1-415 required:  \r\n\r\n\tTo qualify for reimbursement [from the Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund] under\r\n  this section, the higher tier . . . contractor . . . must collect documentation\r\n  of insurance as provided in subsection (A) on a standard form acceptable to the\r\n  commission. Â The documentation must be collected at the time the contractor or\r\n  subcontractor is engaged to perform work and must be turned over to the\r\n  commission at the time a claim is filed by the injured employee.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-415 (Supp. 2005).Â  The Fund argued Total Home failed to comply with all\r\n  the statutory requirements by accepting an unsigned certificate as\r\n  documentation of coverage.Â  In affirming the finding that Total Home was entitled\r\n  to transfer liability, we explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe Fundâ€™s sole contention is that because the Certificate of\r\n  Insurance was unsigned, Total Home does not meet the statutory requirement for\r\n  documentation of insurance. Â However, the statute does not require a signed\r\n  Certificate of Insurance. Â It merely states, â€œa standard form acceptable to the\r\n  commission.â€\r\n\t. Â . Â .\r\n\tThe statute gives the commission the discretion of determining\r\n  what is an acceptable form. Â The Appellate Panel found Iyanelâ€™s Certificate of\r\n  Insurance to be a â€œform acceptable to the Commission.â€ Â This finding was not in\r\n  contravention of the literal meaning of the statute. Â Accordingly, we give the\r\n  proper deference to the Appellate Panel in interpreting the statute. Â There is\r\n  no compelling reason to differ with this interpretation of an acceptable form.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 117, 641 S.E.2d at 44.\r\nContrastively,\r\n  the court found compelling reasons to differ with the Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  statutory interpretation in Brown v. Bilo. Â Â 354 S.C. 436, 438, 581\r\n  S.E.2d 836, 837 (2003).Â  In Brown, the issue involved a provision\r\n  requiring physicians to provide employers with information regarding a\r\n  claimantâ€™s treatment.Â  Id.Â  Section 42-15-95 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  mandated that:  \r\n\r\n\tAll existing information compiled by a health care facility, as\r\n  defined in Section 44-7-130, or a health care provider licensed pursuant to\r\n  Title 40 pertaining directly to a workersâ€™ compensation claim must be provided\r\n  to the insurance carrier, the employer, the employee, their attorneys or the\r\n  South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, within fourteen days after\r\n  receipt of written request . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-15-95 (Supp. 2002).[2]\r\nRelying\r\n  on this provision, Brownâ€™s employer hired a rehabilitation nurse to contact\r\n  Brownâ€™s physician regarding the cause and nature of her condition.Â  Brownâ€™s attorney\r\n  wrote letters to the nurse and treating physician, cautioning them not to\r\n  engage in ex parte communications about Brownâ€™s treatment.Â  When the\r\n  employer complained to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, Brownâ€™s attorney\r\n  was instructed to â€œcease and desist from obstructing contact, including contact\r\n  involving ex parte communications, meetings, correspondence, and/or\r\n  answering questions in written and oral form, between the treating physician and\r\n  the defendantâ€™s representatives.â€Â  Brown, 354 S.C. at 438, 581 S.E.2d at\r\n  837.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s order, reasoning that allowing\r\n  employers and their representatives to communicate directly with treating\r\n  physicians might facilitate â€œswift and sure compensation.â€Â  Id. at 441,\r\n  581 S.E.2d at 837.Â  The supreme court reversed, citing adherence to the\r\n  principle articulated in Wigfall. Â â€œ[W]orkers compensation is a creature\r\n  of statute. Â As such, we are bound to strictly construe the terms of the\r\n  statute and to rely on the General Assembly to amend the statute where\r\n  necessary.â€ Â Id.\r\nThe\r\n  court focused on the plain language of the provision at issue and announced:\r\n\r\n\tSection 42-15-95 contemplates the disclosure of existing written\r\n  records and documentary materials.Â  The statute refers to the exchange of\r\n  â€œexisting information,â€ â€œmedical record[s],â€ and â€œX-ray[s]â€ after receipt of a\r\n  written request. Â Moreover, it provides a penalty if the facility or physician\r\n  fails to â€œsendâ€ information as requested. Â This language indicates the General\r\n  Assemblyâ€™s clear intent to require health care providers and facilities to\r\n  forward existing written records and documents. Â The statute does not authorize\r\n  other â€œex parteâ€ methods of communication between an insurance carrier,\r\n  employer, or their representatives and the claimantâ€™s health care provider. Â Of\r\n  course, insurance carriers and employers may obtain additional information\r\n  through approved methods of discovery.Â  Likewise, employer representatives may\r\n  speak with the claimantâ€™s health care provider provided they obtain the\r\n  claimantâ€™s permission.\r\n\r\nId. at 439-40, 581 S.E.2d at 838.Â \r\n  Notwithstanding the appellate courtâ€™s generally deferential posture regarding an\r\n  administrative agencyâ€™s interpretation of an applicable statute, the court\r\n  held, â€œwhere, as here, the plain language of the statute is contrary to the\r\n  agencyâ€™s interpretation, the Court will reject the agencyâ€™s interpretation.â€ Â Id. at 440, 581 S.E.2d at 838.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Interpretation of â€œWillful Intention to\r\n  Killâ€ \r\nIn keeping\r\n  with the mandate to strictly construe workersâ€™ compensation statutes, we must\r\n  apply the plain and ordinary meaning to words and terms in section 42-9-60,\r\n  without resorting to subtle or forced construction.Â  The language of section\r\n  42-9-60 bars compensation for death that is the result of an individualâ€™s\r\n  willful intention to kill himself.Â  The term â€œwillful intention,â€ as used in\r\n  the statute, means a deliberate or formed intention. Â Zeigler v. S. C. Law\r\n    Enforcement Div., 250 S.C. 326, 157 S.E.2d 598 (1967).Â  â€œThe word â€˜willfulâ€™\r\n  has the same meaning as it has always had under the common law.Â  â€˜Wilfulâ€™ means\r\n  â€˜intentional.â€™ â€ Â Reeves v. Carolina Foundry &amp; Mach. Works, 194 S.C.\r\n  403, 9 S.E.2d 919 (1940). Â An act of deliberate intent is not impulsive or\r\n  instinctive, but rather it is voluntary conduct, so grave and serious as to\r\n  evidence willful intent.Â  Zeigler, 250 S.C. at 331, 157 S.E.2d at 600.Â  But\r\n  if an employeeâ€™s conduct is spontaneous, impulsive, instinctive or otherwise\r\n  lacking a deliberate or formed intention to do injury, it is not the result of\r\n  willful intention.Â  Youmans v. Coastal Petroleum Co., 333 S.C. 195, 198,\r\n  508 S.E.2d 43, 45 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Kinsey v. Champion Am. Serv. Ctr., 268 S.C. 177, 181, 232 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1977).Â  See also Â Sponatskyâ€™s\r\n    Case, 108 N.E. 466, 467 (1915) (describing willful intention in regard to\r\n  suicide as â€œa voluntary willful choice determined by a moderately intelligent\r\n  mental power which knows the purpose and the physical effect of the suicidal\r\n  act, even though the choice is dominated and ruled by a disordered mindâ€).Â  \r\n \r\nWebsterâ€™s\r\n  New Collegiate Dictionary defines suicide as â€œthe act or an instance of\r\n  taking oneâ€™s own life voluntarily and intentionally especially by a person of\r\n  years of discretion and of sound mind.â€Â  Webster, 1156 (1979).Â  Suicide\r\n  is â€œthe intentional killing of oneself.â€Â  Oxford American Dictionary\r\n    of Current English, 813 (1999).Â  See also Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary,\r\n  1434 (6th ed. 1992) (defining suicide as â€œ[s]elf destruction; the deliberate\r\n  termination of oneâ€™s own life).  \r\nBy\r\n  definition, death from suicide is the result of an individualâ€™s willful\r\n  intention to kill himself.Â  The legislatureâ€™s intent in drafting this statute\r\n  is evident from the plain language.Â  The statute is unambiguous, clear on its\r\n  face, and requires no further construction.Â   \r\nFault generally\r\n  has no bearing upon an employeeâ€™s right to recover workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  benefits in South Carolina. Â See Zeigler, 250 S.C. at 329, 157\r\n  S.E.2d at 599. Â The only exception to this general principle under our statute\r\n  is in section 42-9-60. Â See Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C.\r\n  173, 190, 528 S.E.2d 435, 444 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  When the legislature carves out\r\n  a single exception to a general statutory principle, our resolve to strictly\r\n  construe that exception must be unequivocal.Â  â€œ[T]he right to benefits is\r\n  barred where the acts of the employee are such as to come within the legislative\r\n  exception of willful intent to injure.â€Â  Zeigler, 250 S.C. at 329, 157\r\n  S.E.2d at 599.\r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel ruled Harveyâ€™s death was the result of suicide.Â  Yet, in clear\r\n  contravention of the literal meaning of section 42-9-60 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code of Laws, the panel awarded death benefits to Harveyâ€™s surviving mother.Â  We\r\n  hold the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision was an error of law and affirm the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s reversal.Â   \r\nII. Â Â Applicable\r\n  Standard in Claims Involving Suicide. \r\nThe determinative\r\n  factor in this case is the standard by which compensability for suicide is\r\n  evaluated.Â  The precedent extant reveals a judicial brouhaha of bewilderment\r\n  and bafflement as to the proper rule in regard to the issue of suicide.Â  The\r\n  cognoscenti of workersâ€™ compensation jurisprudence conceived two expository\r\n  rules:Â Â  â€œwillful intentâ€ and â€œchain of causation.â€Â  In South Carolina, we\r\n  reject the â€œchain of causationâ€ test and adhere to the â€œwillful intentâ€\r\n  standard.  \r\nA. Willful Intent Test\r\nCompensability for suicide ultimately\r\n  turns on the issue of proximate cause versus independent intervening cause.Â  2 Arthur\r\n  Larson &amp; Lex Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, Â§ 38.01 (2000).\r\n  Â â€œThe basic legal question seems to be agreed upon by almost all authorities:Â \r\n  was the act of suicide an intervening cause breaking the chain of causation\r\n  between the initial injury and the death?â€Â  Id.Â  If the decedentâ€™s death\r\n  was the result of â€œwillful intentâ€ to take his life, then â€œwillful intentâ€\r\n  breaks the chain of causation between the injury and death.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  decedentâ€™s death cannot be said to arise out of the employment.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nOriginally,\r\n  the â€œwillful intentâ€ test figured predominantly in the majority of\r\n  jurisdictions deciding workersâ€™ compensation cases.Â  Id.Â  The Massachusetts court described the test, frequently cited as â€œSponatskyâ€™s rule,â€ in a\r\n  1915 opinion:\r\n\r\n\t[W]here there follows as the direct result of a physical\r\n  injury an insanity of such violence as to cause the victim to take his own life\r\n  through an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy â€œwithout conscious\r\n  volition to produce death, having knowledge of the physical consequences of the\r\n  actâ€ then there is a direct and unbroken causal connection between the physical\r\n  injury and the death.Â  But where the resulting insanity is such as to cause\r\n  suicide through a voluntary willful choice determined by a moderately\r\n  intelligent mental power which knows the purposes and the physical effect of\r\n  the suicidal act, even though choice is dominated and ruled by a disordered\r\n  mind, then there is a new and independent agency which breaks the chain of causation\r\n  arising from the injury.Â  \r\n\r\nLarson, supra at Â§ 38.02(1) (citing In\r\n  re Sponatksy, 108 N.E. 466, 468 (Mass. 1915)).Â   \r\nFollowing\r\n  numerous variations of this formula, courts have generally classified\r\n  compensable cases based on the distinction between whether the employeeâ€™s death\r\n  was the result of conscious volition or delirious impulse.Â  Id.Â  Indeed,\r\n  statutory provisions like South Carolinaâ€™s section 42-9-60 that exclude intentionally\r\n  self-inflicted injuries from compensability are often the basis for courtsâ€™\r\n  adherence to â€œSponatskyâ€™s rule.â€Â  Leslie A. Bradshaw, Suicide as Compensable\r\n    Under Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act, 15 A.L.R. 3d 616, Â§3 (originally\r\n  published 1967).Â   \r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court espoused the â€œwillful intentâ€ standard for reviewing a\r\n  death benefits claim in Mitchem v. Fiske Carter Constr. Co., 278 S.C.\r\n  180, 293 S.E.2d 701 (1982).Â  While employed with Fiske, Mitchem injured his\r\n  right knee.Â  He was treated with prescription and over the counter\r\n  medications.Â  Five months later he was found dead from a drug overdose. Â Id. at 181, 293 S.E.2d 701-02. Â His wife sought death benefits, claiming Mitchemâ€™s\r\n  knee injury was a direct cause of his suicide. Â Fiske asserted Mitchemâ€™s death was\r\n  the result of willful intention and not causally related to his employment.Â  Id. Â The supreme court upheld the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusion that willful intention\r\n  barred the death benefits, indicating that Mitchemâ€™s â€œwillful intentâ€ broke the\r\n  causal relationship between the work accident and his subsequent death.Â  Id. at 183, 293 S.E.2d at 703.Â  This holding implicitly rejects the chain of\r\n  causation test, because the chain of causation linking Mitchemâ€™s suicide to his\r\n  work injury was apparently undisputed. Â Nevertheless, the court applied â€œwillful\r\n  intentâ€ as the test for compensability.  \r\nB. Chain of Causation Test\r\nâ€œThe â€œchain-of-causation\r\n  rule,â€ succinctly stated, is that where the injury and its consequences\r\n  directly result in the workmanâ€™s loss of normal judgment and domination by a\r\n  disturbance of the mind, causing the suicide, his suicide is compensable.â€Â \r\n  Bradshaw, 15 A.L.R. 3d 616, Â§5.\r\n\r\n\tThis rule rejects the tort liability concept of fault (which\r\n  stresses the independent intervening cause), and the criminal-law standard of\r\n  insanity (which requires that the person not know what he is doing),\r\n  substituting therefor the â€œchain-of-causationâ€ or â€œbut forâ€ test and the\r\n  requirement of an uncontrollable â€œcompulsionâ€ to commit suicide.Â  This latter\r\n  requirement differs from the uncontrollable â€œimpulseâ€ test, as it has been\r\n  applied under the Sponatski rule, in that the compulsion need not be abrupt or\r\n  unpremeditated, but must be the result of an inability to exercise sound\r\n  discretion.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nUnder\r\n  the chain of causation paradigm, an injury may be compensable if the work\r\n  injury caused the deranged mental condition, which in turn caused suicide.Â  Larson, supra at Â§ 38.01.Â Â Â Â Â  In applying the â€œchain of causationâ€ test, courts\r\n  have emphasized, to varying degrees, a required showing of â€œgenuine brain\r\n  derangement,â€ or â€œsome form of insanity, mental disease, mental derangement, or\r\n  psychosis,â€ as opposed to mere â€œbrooding or depression,â€ â€œmelancholy,\r\n  discouragement, or other sane condition.â€Â  Id.Â  at Â§ 38.03\r\nThe\r\n  â€œwillful intentâ€ test has been gradually displaced by the â€œchain-of causationâ€\r\n  test in the majority of jurisdictions.Â  Id. Â at Â§ 38.01.\r\nC.Â  The North Carolina Standard\r\nNorth Carolina is among the majority of jurisdictions that have adopted the â€œchain of causationâ€\r\n  test to determine if suicide is compensable.Â  See Bradshaw, 15 A.L.R. 3d\r\n  616.Â  In Petty v. Associated Transp., Inc., 173 S.E.2d 321 (N.C. 1970),\r\n  the Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the North Carolina Commissionâ€™s\r\n  denial of death benefits to Pettyâ€™s widow.Â  The Commission held the claim was\r\n  barred based on section 97-12 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, which\r\n  provided in pertinent part:Â  â€œNo compensation shall be payable if the injury or\r\n  death was occasioned by theÂ  . . . willful intention of the employee to injure\r\n  or kill himself or another.â€ Â Petty, 173 S.E.2d at 326.Â   \r\nThe court\r\n  framed the issue with the following question:Â  â€œDoes an employee who\r\n  intentionally takes his own life because of a mental derangement produced by a\r\n  compensable injury act willfully within the meaning of G.S. [section] 97-12?â€Â  Id.Â  The North Carolina court embraced the â€œchain of causationâ€ test and held â€œan\r\n  employee who becomes mentally deranged and deprived of normal judgment as the\r\n  result of a compensable accident and commits suicide in consequence does not\r\n  act willfully within the meaning of G.S. [section] 97-12.â€ Â Id. at 329. Â In\r\n  so doing, the court concluded the â€œchain of causationâ€ test best effectuated\r\n  the purpose and intent of the North Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. Â Id. Â \r\nThe Petty court rejected the Commissionâ€™s construction of section 97-12 as incompatible\r\n  with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Actâ€”which was â€œto provide for the injured\r\n  workman, or his dependents in the event of his death, at the cost of the\r\n  industry.â€Â  Id. at 328.Â  To that end the court announced the rule of\r\n  statutory interpretation in North Carolina:Â  â€œ[B]enefits under the Act â€˜should\r\n  not be denied by a technical, narrow, and strict construction.â€™ â€ Id. (citing Hollman v. City of Raleigh, 159 S.E.2d 874, 882 (N.C. 1968).Â  \r\n \r\nFollowing Petty, the North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  denial of benefits in a later workersâ€™ compensation case that involved\r\n  suicide.Â  Thompson v. Lenoir Transfer Co., 268 S.E.2d 534 (N.C. App.\r\n  1980).Â  Recognizing that Petty established â€œmental derangement may be\r\n  caused by the consequences of the injury, including pain and despair, as well\r\n  as by the injury itself,â€ the Lenior Transfer court remanded the case\r\n  for consideration of evidence that a direct causal connection between the\r\n  accident and the suicide existed.Â  Id. at 539.\r\nNorth Carolina court decisions interpreting the stateâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation statute are\r\n  entitled to weight when South Carolina courts interpret our workersâ€™\r\n  compensation law because the South Carolina statute was fashioned after that of\r\n  North Carolina. Â Stephen v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 340, 478\r\n  S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, where North Carolinaâ€™s public policy\r\n  and equity principles differ materially, South Carolinaâ€™s legislative and\r\n  judicial pronouncements must prevail.Â  Wigfall v. Tideland Utilities, Inc.,\r\n  354 S.C. 100, 114-15, 580 S.E.2d 100, 107 (2003).Â   \r\n\r\n\tIt is essential to remember that the Legislature created a system,\r\n  for good or ill, which serves a social function by providing the injured\r\n  employee with sufficient income and medical care to keep him from destitution .\r\n  . . [it is] not designed to compensate the employee for his injury, but merely\r\n  to provide him with the bare minimum of income and medical care to keep him\r\n  from being a burden to others. . . .\r\n\tAn important function of legislation is to consider and to balance\r\n  the competing interests and equities arising from the conduct of human affairs.Â \r\n  Workerâ€™s compensation laws are a classic example of this legislative balancing\r\n  of the equities. Â When the legislature has struck a balance by enacting a\r\n  statutory rule, the courts have no prerogative to annul the legislative choice\r\n  by applying â€œchancellorâ€™s footâ€ notions of equity in its place. Â Stated\r\n  differently, it is not the province of this Court to perform legislative\r\n  functions. Â The function of equity is to supplement the law, not to displace\r\n  it.\r\n\r\nId. at 116-17, 580 S.E.2d at 108 (internal\r\n  citations and quotations omitted).Â   \r\nIn Petty,\r\n  the North Carolina Supreme Court enunciated a rule that directly contravenes South Carolinaâ€™s judicial policy of strictly construing workersâ€™ compensation statutes.Â  Our\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation law is a creature of statute, enacted in derogation of\r\n  the common law, and we are bound to strictly construe its terms.Â  Brown v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 431, 581 S.E.2d 836, 837 (2003).Â  The language\r\n  in section 42-9-60 bars compensation for death that is the result of a willful\r\n  intention.Â  â€œWillful intentâ€ is the standard to be applied in South Carolina in\r\n  determining whether a self-inflicted injury or death is compensable under\r\n  section 42-9-60.Â  We, therefore, decline to follow the majority of\r\n  jurisdictions, including North Carolina, in embracing the â€œchain of causationâ€\r\n  test.  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Evidentiary Analysis\r\nIn\r\n  reversing the Appellate Panelâ€™s award of benefits, the circuit court concluded,\r\n  as a matter of law, that if suicide is compensable at all, it must be the\r\n  result of a spontaneous or uncontrollable impulse or lapse of rationality,\r\n  negating Harveyâ€™s willful intention.Â  Applying the â€œwillful intentâ€ standard, we\r\n  review the record for substantial evidence that Harveyâ€™s death (1) was not the\r\n  result of his willful intention, or (2) was a â€œnatural consequenceâ€ flowing\r\n  from his compensable accident.  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Negation of Willful Intent \r\n\r\nUnder section 42-9-60, suicide is a\r\n  defense to a workersâ€™ compensation death claim, for which the party asserting\r\n  it has the burden of proof.Â  Zeigler v. S. C. Law Enforcement Division,Â \r\n  250 S.C. 326, 157 S.E.2d 598 (1967); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-80,\r\n  restated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-60 as amended by Act No. 111, 2007 S.C. Acts\r\n  (â€œIn the event that any person claims that the provisions of this section are\r\n  applicable in any case, the burden of proof shall be upon such person.â€).\r\nâ€œ[W]here\r\n  the testimony on the subject produces a conviction in favor of suicide, that\r\n  fact shows that the employer has met the burden resting upon him. Â Only if,\r\n  after a consideration of all of the testimony, a reasonable inference of\r\n  suicide cannot be drawn, can it be said that the employer failed to meet the\r\n  burden.â€Â  In re Crawford, 205 S.C. 72, 72, 30 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1944).\r\nThompson asserts Cisson failed to prove Harveyâ€™s suicide was the result of his â€œwillful intentionâ€ to kill himself.Â  Concomitantly,\r\n  Thompson contends Harveyâ€™s work injury aggravated his pre-existing psychiatric\r\n  condition to the extent he was no longer in control and his death was not a\r\n  result of willful intention.Â   \r\nWhether\r\n  an employee acted with willful intent to injure or kill himself is a question\r\n  of fact for the Appellate Panel to determine.Â  Youmans v. Coastal Petroleum\r\n    Co., 333 S.C. 195, 199, 508 S.E.2d 43, 45 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The finding\r\n  must be predicated on the employeeâ€™s deliberate or formed intention rather than\r\n  on spontaneous, impulsive, or instinctive conduct.Â  Id.Â  The act must be\r\n  a product of the employeeâ€™s conscious volition.Â  See Zeigler, 250\r\n  S.C. at 331, 157 S.E.2d at 600 (indicating an act of deliberate intent is not\r\n  impulsive or instinctive, but rather it is voluntary conduct, so grave and\r\n  serious as to evidence willful intent).Â   \r\nApproximately\r\n  six months prior to his death Harveyâ€™s deposition was recorded.Â  He was thirty\r\n  years old at the time and claimed to have completed middle school.Â  He never\r\n  obtained his GED and admitted he could read and write very little.Â  Harvey never served in the military or pursued technical training or adult education.Â  He\r\n  lost his driverâ€™s license approximately eleven years prior to his deposition\r\n  due to a DUI charge but had plans to re-apply after the first of the year.Â  Harvey acknowledged one other arrest when he was fourteen for distributing marijuana.Â \r\n \r\nHarvey testified he had bipolar disorder for most of his life.Â  He was hospitalized twice\r\n  for suicide attempts following separation from his wife, in the mid 1980s, and\r\n  from his girlfriend, in the mid 1990s.Â  In 1995, Harvey discontinued medication\r\n  for his bipolar disorder.Â  He stated, â€œI was just dealing with it on my own.â€Â \r\n  He alleged he stopped treatment â€œ[b]ecause I couldnâ€™t afford the medications.â€Â \r\n  Harvey received no further treatment for his psychiatric condition until\r\n  seeing Dr. Galvarino in 2001.Â  He claimed he had been â€œdealing with it all\r\n  rightâ€ without his medication.Â   \r\nNine\r\n  months prior to Harveyâ€™s suicide, he began living with his mother after\r\n  separating from his girlfriend.Â  Harvey denied any depression related to the\r\n  break-up of the relationship and professed â€œIâ€™ve been with my mother and everythingâ€™s\r\n  been fine.â€Â  He disavowed any suicide attempts in the last five years, or since\r\n  January of 2000.Â   \r\nAt the\r\n  time of his deposition Harveyâ€™s chief complaint was pain resulting from his\r\n  work related injury.Â  He had been treated with physical therapy, medication, steroid\r\n  injections, and a TENS unit.Â  Additionally, he had mobility problems and walked\r\n  with a cane.Â  Harvey alleged his injury caused â€œa lot of depression.â€Â  â€œYou\r\n  know, once you get hurt and you canâ€™t do certain things, you ainâ€™t brining in\r\n  no money, it causes problems.â€\r\nThompson\r\n  was deposed in June of 2002, three months after Harveyâ€™s death.Â  She identified\r\n  her sonâ€™s psychiatric condition as depression but knew relatively little about his\r\n  medical history.Â  She recalled taking him to a mental health clinic the first\r\n  time he required hospitalization, because â€œhe was real depressed.Â  He had been\r\n  taking drugs.â€Â  However, Thompson was unaware of Harveyâ€™s second\r\n  hospitalization and disclaimed any knowledge he had ever attempted suicide.Â  She\r\n  confirmed he was on quite a few medications when he moved in to live with her,\r\n  but she could only specify Oxycontin as one of them.Â  Thompson said Harvey kept all his medications in his room, and she did not assist him in managing his\r\n  medications, except to transport him to fill his prescriptions.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the nine months Harvey lived with Thompson, she described his mental\r\n  condition:Â  â€œHe had his days.Â  Some days he was better than others, you know,\r\n  but I have seen a lot better.Â  [H]e kindly stayed to hisself.â€Â  When asked if\r\n  he seemed to get better or worse over the course of his nine-month stay,\r\n  Thompson answered:\r\n\r\n\tI would say that he was about the same, but he couldnâ€™t goâ€”like he\r\n  couldnâ€™t go with me shopping if I actually had to do a lot of shopping because\r\n  he could not walk that far without a cane.Â  Okay?Â  He tried it one time.Â  He\r\n  fell in the store, and I had to get him out of the store.Â  And that got on his\r\n  nerves.Â  Heâ€”I donâ€™t know what all he was having to take for pain, but now,\r\n  [Harvey], heâ€™s not the type of person that would want to take medicine unless\r\n  he really had to.Â  And since this [work] accident, he has been in a lot of\r\n  pain. \r\n\r\nThompson\r\n  averred Harvey never really discussed his injuries or the details of his\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation claim with her.Â  She simply drove him to his appointments\r\n  with Dr. Shallcross and Dr. Galvarino.Â  She estimated he saw Dr. Galvarino once\r\n  a month and Dr. Shallcross about every three months.Â   \r\nLeading\r\n  up to the day of his death, Thompson did not observe anything different about Harvey, his daily schedule, or a change in his habits.Â  He said nothing to her about any\r\n  particular problems.Â  On the Saturday before he died, she indicated â€œhe didnâ€™t\r\n  act like there was anything at all even bothering him.â€Â   \r\nThompson\r\n  was unable to awaken Harvey on the morning of March 4, 2002.Â  He had an\r\n  appointment with Dr. Galvarino, and she had planned to get him up early to\r\n  shower.Â  The room was undisturbed; the television was on and Harvey held the\r\n  remote in his hand.Â  Thompson reported he was in his normal sleeping position. Â No\r\n  suicide note was discovered.Â  Thompson professed she believed her sonâ€™s death\r\n  was accidentalâ€”that he ingested his medication, fell asleep, and took it again\r\n  when he later awoke, forgetting about the first dose.Â Â   \r\nIn a\r\n  statement clarifying autopsy findings, Dr. Woodard explained:Â   \r\n\r\n\tWithin the gastric contents far in excess of ten intact Oxycontin\r\n  pills of a 10 mg. dose were identified.Â  These were mixed with other\r\n  unidentifiable pill debris.Â  This finding within the gastric contents required\r\n  a willful decision to swallow a massive number of pills.Â  This number of pills\r\n  was far in excess of any individual who mildly exceeded their recommended\r\n  dosage or were elicitly using a controlled substance for recreational\r\n  purposes.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Shallcrossâ€™s records first mention Harveyâ€™s emotional condition in January of\r\n  2001.Â  On that date, Harvey denied suicidal intent, but admitted he had\r\n  fleeting thoughts of killing himself.Â  Harvey asked for antidepressant\r\n  medication at that time.Â  In May 2001, Dr. Shallcross reported Harvey was not receiving treatment for his pre-existing bipolar disorder, but recommended\r\n  he obtain treatment regardless of his physical status.Â  Dr. Shallcross advised,\r\n  â€œit could reasonably be said that with his problems with job disruption due to\r\n  his work-related injury that being under the care of a psychologist or\r\n  psychiatrist would be more strongly indicated now than in general.â€Â  Dr.\r\n  Shallcross noted he planned to begin tapering off Harveyâ€™s Oxycontin and\r\n  Lortab. Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  August 30, 2001, Dr. Shallcross observed Harveyâ€™s affect was a bit brighter and\r\n  commented that he was seeing Dr. Galvarino for his bipolar disorder.Â  The\r\n  report of his December 6, 2001 visit revealed Harvey was currently using more\r\n  Oxycontin than he was prescribed.Â  Dr. Shallcrossâ€™s impressions of his emotional\r\n  condition were not recorded.Â  Finally, on February 7, 2002, Dr. Shallcross\r\n  wrote: â€œI did not detect any evidence of mania or severe depression in this\r\n  patient and can make no claim as to whether his current status is based on his\r\n  pre-existing bipolar disorder or whether this was aggravated by his work\r\n  condition.â€Â   \r\nThompson\r\n  relies heavily on the testimony of Harveyâ€™s psychiatrist in support of her\r\n  claim that Harveyâ€™s psychiatric condition negated his willful intention to kill\r\n  himself.Â  Harvey began treating with Dr. Galvarino approximately fifteen months\r\n  after his work injury.Â  Dr. Galvarino characterized Harveyâ€™s emotional state as\r\n  progressively deteriorating. Â He testified in deposition that Harveyâ€™s\r\n  condition seemed to be irreversible, rendering him totally and permanently disabled.Â \r\n  Dr. Galvarino observed that Harvey was at times â€œoverbearing, losing control\r\n  readily,â€ and at other times â€œin better control . . . speech was coherent and\r\n  relevant and mood was elated.â€Â  In one treatment session Dr. Galvarino noted\r\n  â€œThe new medication is not working.Â  He also has been crying.Â  The patient has\r\n  been target practicing with a pellet gun.Â  He was very angry, about to explode.\r\n  . . .Â  His life is very limited.Â  Heâ€™s about to lose control.â€Â   \r\nDr. Galvarino opined Harveyâ€™s compensable work injury was causally linked to his\r\n  suicide:\r\n\r\n\tThe patient, as I mentioned earlier, did have a longstanding\r\n  history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and alcohol and drug abuse.Â \r\n  The patient was involved in an injury in [January][3] of 2000. Â Ever since, the patient has\r\n  been experiencing depression.Â  Seems to me the depression has worsened.Â  When I\r\n  saw him the patient was evaluated, given treatment. . . .Â  Treatment has\r\n  failed.Â  The patientâ€™s illness has progressed to an extent that he could no\r\n  longer bear it; henceforth, his suicide.Â  Itâ€™s my opinion that patientâ€™s\r\n  depression was significantly exacerbated by his injury.Â  The patientâ€™s suicide\r\n  was secondary to his depression, was exacerbated to a point that the patient\r\n  could no longer handle it. . . . \r\n\r\nAlthough\r\n  Dr. Galvarinoâ€™s testimony may support a chain of causation between Harveyâ€™s work injury and his suicide, chain of causation is not the test for\r\n  compensability of a self-inflicted injury under our statute and judicial\r\n  precedent.Â  If Harveyâ€™s death is to be compensable at all, it must be the\r\n  result of a spontaneous or uncontrollable impulse, or lapse of conscious\r\n  volition negating his willful intention.Â  The record before us contains little evidence\r\n  to support that Harveyâ€™s suicide meets that standard.\r\nSubstantial\r\n  evidence unquestionably documents Harveyâ€™s injury, pain, and severe psychiatric\r\n  symptoms.Â  However, evidence in the record tending to negate willful intention\r\n  is de minimus.Â  Dr. Galvarinoâ€™s medical reports Â indicate Harvey was at times feeling â€œout of controlâ€ and unable to cope.Â  Yet, at other times Harvey appeared to be managing his illness without extreme distress.Â  Testimony from his\r\n  mother and notes from Dr. Shallcross reveal nothing to indicate Harvey was not rational or in control of his own volition in the months prior to his death.Â \r\n \r\nHarveyâ€™s own deposition testimony appears to reflect a fairly intact thought process.Â  He\r\n  was able to recount his medical history and the past events leading up to his\r\n  previous hospitalizations.Â  He acknowledged his suicide attempts resulted from\r\n  depression over failed relationships.Â  Moreover, Harvey apparently understood\r\n  the efficacy of medication for his psychiatric symptoms and asked Dr. Shallcross to prescribe an antidepressant when his emotional condition\r\n  warranted it.Â   \r\nHarveyâ€™s two previous suicide attempts inherently suggest deliberative thinking that\r\n  contemplates oneâ€™s own demise as a way of coping with depression.Â  Dr. Shallcross mentioned Harvey had fleeting thoughts of killing himself, and Dr.\r\n  Galvarinoâ€™s records reflect concern about Harveyâ€™s feelings of helplessness,\r\n  hopelessness, and suicidal ideation.Â  Harveyâ€™s admission that he had been\r\n  target practicing with a pellet gun raises additional concern about his coping\r\n  strategy.Â  Â Â \r\nNeither\r\n  Dr. Shallcross nor Dr. Galvarino opined Harveyâ€™s suicide was the result of a mental\r\n  process that negated his willful intention.Â  Though Dr. Galvarino reported\r\n  episodes of severe distress, in the end he asserted that, if Harvey committed\r\n  suicide, it was intentional, because by definition, suicide is intentional.Â \r\n  Finally, Dr. Woodard concluded, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\r\n  that Harveyâ€™s death was the result of a willful massive overdose of\r\n  medication.Â   \r\nÂ Considering\r\n  all of the direct and circumstantial evidence, including lay and expert\r\n  testimony, to conclude Harveyâ€™s suicide was not the result of his willful\r\n  intention would be surmise, conjecture, or speculation.Â  The record fails to\r\n  support that Harvey was overcome by a spontaneous, impulsive, or instinctive\r\n  urge, or that he was devoid of deliberate or formed intention.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  chain of causation Dr. Galvarino posited may have established that the\r\n  aggravation of Harveyâ€™s psychiatric condition was compensable.Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  willful intention was the independent intervening variable that severed the causal\r\n  relationship between the injury and suicide.Â  Without evidence negating willful\r\n  intention, the only reasonable inference is that Harveyâ€™s suicide was the\r\n  result of his willful intention.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel erred as a matter of law in apparently evaluating\r\n  compensability for Harveyâ€™s suicide using the chain of causation test.Â  The\r\n  appropriate standard in this state is willful intent.Â  Moreover, the decision\r\n  that Harveyâ€™s suicide was compensable is clearly erroneous in view of substantial\r\n  evidence in the record that Harveyâ€™s death was the result of his willful\r\n  intention.  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Natural Consequence of Compensable\r\n  Injury\r\nThompson maintains Harveyâ€™s suicide is\r\n  compensable because it was a â€œnatural consequenceâ€ of his work-related injury.Â \r\n  We disagree.  \r\n&nbsp;â€œA\r\n  [mental] condition which is induced by a compensable physical injury is . . .\r\n  causally related to that injury.â€Â  Getsinger v.

Â \r\nAggravation\r\n  of pre-existing psychiatric problems is compensable if that aggravation is\r\n  caused by a work-related physical injury. Â Anderson v. Baptist Med.

App. 2006).\r\nA\r\n  condition is compensable unless it is due solely to the natural progression of\r\n  a pre-existing condition.Â  Mullinax, 318 S.C. at 437, 458 S.E.2d at 80. Â It\r\n  is no defense that the accident, standing alone, would not have caused the\r\n  claimantâ€™s condition, because the employer takes the employee as it finds him\r\n  or her.Â  Id. â€œ[A]ggravation of a pre-existing condition is compensable\r\n  where disability is continued for a longer time, even though no disability\r\n  would normally have resulted from the injury alone, or even if the aggravation\r\n  would have caused no injury to an employee who was not afflicted with the\r\n  condition.â€ Â Id. (internal quotations omitted).\r\nThe â€œnatural\r\n  consequencesâ€ flowing from a compensable injury, absent an independent\r\n  intervening cause, are compensable.Â  Id. at 436, 458 S.E.2d at 79.Â  â€œThe\r\n  causal sequence . . . may be more indirect or complex, but as long as the\r\n  causal connection is in fact present the compensability of the subsequent\r\n  condition is beyond question.â€Â  Id. at 437, 458 S.E.2d at 80 (quoting Arthur\r\n  Larson, The Law of Workmenâ€™s Compensation Â§ 13.11(b) (1994)).  \r\nIn Mullinax,\r\n  the claimant sustained a work-related injury to her back and sought medical\r\n  treatment.Â  Subsequently, she developed incontinence she claimed resulted from\r\n  the injury or from the exercise treatment prescribed for the injury.Â  318 S.C.\r\n  at 433, 458 S.E.2d at 78.Â  The employer contended claimantâ€™s incontinence was\r\n  caused by a prior hysterectomy and â€œnot work related nor related to any problem\r\n  caused by treatment for her work-related injury.â€Â  Id. at 434, 458\r\n  S.E.2d at 78.Â  The single commissioner, whose findings were adopted by the\r\n  Appellate Panel, found no causal relationship between the claimantâ€™s\r\n  incontinence and her work-related injury.Â  Reviewing the record for substantial\r\n  evidence supporting the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision, the court of appeals\r\n  determined â€œall of the evidence shows that, the accident or the exercises, a\r\n  natural consequence of the accident, at a minimum aggravated the incontinence.â€Â \r\n  The court reasoned:Â   \r\n\r\n\tThe Commission committed legal error when it based its decision\r\n  solely on the lack of a medical opinion stating [claimantâ€™s] injury caused the\r\n  incontinence. Â In doing so, it ignored the medical and circumstantial evidence\r\n  in the record, which shows either the injury or the treatment for the injury\r\n  aggravated the incontinence.Â  This is true even though [the claimant] may have\r\n  suffered some degree of incontinence before the injury, and even though her\r\n  prior medical history made her condition more susceptible to aggravation by the\r\n  injury or its treatment. Â Both circumstantial evidence and lay testimony are\r\n  competent in workerâ€™s compensation cases if the injury and disability can be\r\n  reasonably connected through their use.\r\n\r\nFollowing\r\n  the reasoning in Mullinax, the argument could be made in the case sub judice that Harveyâ€™s knee injury caused the chronic pain, a natural\r\n  consequence of the injury, which aggravated his pre-existing psychiatric\r\n  condition.Â  However, Thompson extends the causal relationship even further,\r\n  claiming as a natural consequence of Harveyâ€™s aggravated pre-existing\r\n  psychiatric condition, he committed suicide two years later.Â   \r\nAs we\r\n  held in Mullinax, natural consequences flowing from a compensable injury\r\n  are only compensable absent an independent intervening cause. Â 318 S.C. at 436,\r\n  458 S.E.2d at 79.Â  Yet, suicide, by definition, is an act of willful intention.\r\n  Â Suicide is an unnatural consequence of work related depression because it\r\n  injects the willful intention of the employee into the calculation.Â  The\r\n  employeeâ€™s willful intention to kill himself is the independent intervening\r\n  cause that severs the link with the compensable injury.Â   \r\nMoreover,\r\n  while suicide resulting from depression is foreseeable, it is not a natural\r\n  consequence of depression.Â  Conceptually, the notion of natural consequence connotes\r\n  the inevitability of a result beyond the employeeâ€™s control.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule,\r\n  as a matter of law, that the plain language of section 42-9-60 bars\r\n  compensation for Harveyâ€™s death resulting from his â€œwilful intention to kill\r\n  himself.â€Â  The test in South Carolina for evaluating compensability is whether\r\n  the employeeâ€™s suicide was the result of â€œwillful intent.â€Â  Unless substantial\r\n  evidence supports a finding that â€œwillful intentâ€ is negated by spontaneous,\r\n  impulsive, or instinctive conduct, without deliberate or formed intention, or\r\n  without conscious volition to produce death, the statutory bar to workersâ€™\r\n  compensation benefits applies.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  thorough review of the record, we conclude the evidence fails to establish that\r\n  Harveyâ€™s psychiatric condition negated his willful intent to kill himself.Â \r\n  Willful intention, as an independent intervening variable, broke the chain of\r\n  causation between the work-related injury and suicide.Â  Consequently, Harveyâ€™s suicide was not causally related to or a â€œnatural consequenceâ€ flowing from his\r\n  work-related injury.  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J. and GOOLSBY, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â The South Carolina General Assembly\r\n  amended section 42-9-60 on June 25, 2007, by adding the following language to\r\n  the existing text: â€œIn the\r\n  event that any person claims that the provisions of this section are applicable\r\n  in any case, the burden of proof shall be upon such person.â€Â  This amendment\r\n  and other legislative changes in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act apply only to\r\n  injuries occurring on or after the effective date of the 2007 enactment, July\r\n  1, 2007.Â  Act No. 111, 2007 S.C.

Â In December 2004, Judge R. Wright Turbeville granted Mother and\r\n  Father a divorce.Â  As a shareholder/member of W.R. Simpson Farms, L.L.C.,\r\n  Husband was named a party to Mother and Fatherâ€™s divorce action. Â \r\nHusband and Becky H. Simpson (Wife) were granted a divorce in\r\n  March 2005 through a bifurcated Decree of Divorce. Â In March 2006, Judge\r\n  Frances P. Segars-Andrews heard the remaining issues pursuant to the bifurcated\r\n  Divorce Decree.Â  Husband and Wife entered into a Consent Order on the issues of\r\n  child custody and visitation, and Judge Segars-Andrews issued written\r\n  instructions for a Final Order on all remaining issues.  \r\nLon Shull (Shull), a partner in the law firm of Andrews and Shull\r\n  in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, was a witness, via affidavit, at the request\r\n  of Motherâ€™s attorneys, in Mother and Fatherâ€™s divorce action regarding the\r\n  issue of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Shullâ€™s law partner is Mark O. Andrews, the husband\r\n  of Judge Segars-Andrews. Â Â \r\nSubsequent to Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ issuance of instructions for\r\n  the Final Order, Husband filed a motion for a new trial which asserted a conflict\r\n  of interest had not been disclosed. Â Husband alleged a conflict due to Shullâ€™s\r\n  involvement in Mother and Fatherâ€™s case and his connection to Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrewsâ€™ husband.Â  Husbandâ€™s motion did not allege any prejudice or bias\r\n  as a result of this conflict, and after a hearing on this motion, Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrews denied the motion.Â Â Â   \r\nAt this same hearing, however, Judge Segars-Andrews, acting sua\r\n  sponte, orally stated she would recuse herself.Â  Judge Segars-Andrews raised\r\n  the question of whether she should disqualify herself because James McLaren,\r\n  Wifeâ€™s counsel in the present divorce action, and Shull had been co-counsel in\r\n  a personal injury case.Â  This unrelated case ended in late 2004 or early 2005\r\n  and resulted in a substantial fee to Shullâ€™s firm, which in turn benefited his\r\n  law partner, Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ husband.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAfter receiving memos from both parties on this question, Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrews found the situation did not require her to disqualify herself,\r\n  and therefore, she had a duty to hear the case.Â  This appeal follows.Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œUnder South Carolina law, if there is no evidence of judicial\r\n  prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure to disqualify [herself] will not be reversed on\r\n  appeal.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 524, 599 S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe begin by addressing Wifeâ€™s argument, which was made for the\r\n  first time at oral argument, that this Court is procedurally barred from\r\n  hearing this appeal.Â  Wife argues a denial of a motion for disqualification of\r\n  a judge is an interlocutory order, and therefore, it may only be reviewed by\r\n  this Court on an appeal from a final order.Â  See Rogers v. Wilkins,\r\n  275 S.C. 28, 29-30, 267 S.E.2d 86, 87 (1980) (finding the denial of a motion\r\n  for disqualification is interlocutory and reviewable only after an appeal from\r\n  final judgment); see Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 312, 474\r\n  S.E.2d 424, 427 (1996) (â€œA denial of a motion for disqualification of a judge\r\n  is an interlocutory order not affecting the merits and, thus, is reviewable\r\n  only on appeal from a final order.â€). Â \r\nWife is correct in her statement of the law; however, the case\r\n  before us is distinguishable from the cases Wife references to support her\r\n  argument.Â  In the current case, although two separate appeals[1] have been filed, each follows a final\r\n  order from the family court.Â  Neither party moved to consolidate the two\r\n  appeals, so they have proceeded separately.Â  Because this appeal of Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrewsâ€™ denial of a motion for disqualification follows a final order,\r\n  it is not an interlocutory appeal and is, therefore, properly before this\r\n  Court.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in overturning its sua sponte recusal.Â  We disagree. Â Â Â  Â \r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s Code of Judicial Conduct states, â€œA judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n  appearance of impropriety in all of the judgeâ€™s activities.â€ Â Canon 2 of the\r\n  Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR.Â  The Code requires a judge to\r\n  â€œdisqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judgeâ€™s\r\n  impartiality might reasonably be questioned . . . .â€Â  Canon 2 of the Code of\r\n  Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR.Â  When disqualification is not required,\r\n  however, the Code states, â€œA judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to\r\n  the judge . . . .â€Â  Canon 3B(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR.Â  â€œA judgeâ€™s impartiality might reasonably be questioned when his [or\r\n  her] factual findings are not supported by the record.â€Â  Patel, 359 S.C.\r\n  at 524, 599 S.E.2d at 118.Â   \r\nIn the current case, Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ findings are supported\r\n  by the record.Â  Judge Segars-Andrews provided a detailed list of findings in\r\n  support of her decision on how to equitably divide the assets of Husband and\r\n  Wife.Â  Judge Segars-Andrews made these findings and included them in her\r\n  â€œInstructions for Orderâ€ before she remembered the previous relationship\r\n  between her husbandâ€™s law partner and Wifeâ€™s counsel. Â Facts in the record support\r\n  Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ findings. Â We see no evidence showing bias or prejudice.Â \r\n \r\nThe party seeking disqualification must do more than merely allege\r\n  bias on the judgeâ€™s behalf; the party must present some evidence of judicial\r\n  prejudice or bias.Â  Id. at 524, 599 S.E.2d at 118.Â  â€œIn applying Canon\r\n  3[(E)](1), the South Carolina Supreme Court has stated that the movant or\r\n  petitioner must show some evidence of the bias or prejudice of the judge.â€Â  Lyvers\r\n    v. Lyvers, 280 S.C. 361, 367, 312 S.E.2d 590, 594 (Ct. App. 1984) (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).Â  When an appellant offers no evidence to\r\n  support his claim of partiality, the trial judge is correct to deny a Motion\r\n  for Recusal.Â  See Christensen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 74, 476\r\n  S.E.2d 692, 694 (1996) (â€œAppellant offered no evidence to support his claim of\r\n  partiality.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge properly denied the Motion to\r\n  Recuse.â€).  \r\nHusband has not shown any evidence of bias or prejudice on behalf\r\n  of Judge Segars-Andrews.Â  Husband argues Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ own statements\r\n  about the need to disclose the previous working relationship between her\r\n  husbandâ€™s law partner and Wifeâ€™s counsel might reasonably question her\r\n  impartiality.Â  Husband fails, however, to provide any evidence of how the\r\n  former relationship actually resulted in some prejudice or bias in Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrewsâ€™ ruling.Â  Thus, Judge Segars-Andrews was correct to deny\r\n  Husbandâ€™s request for recusal.Â  Â Â \r\nIn Doe v. Howe, the trial judge chose to make disclosures to\r\n  both sides about his contacts with Howe and his law clerkâ€™s contacts with the\r\n  law firm representing Howe. Â 367 S.C. 432, 439, 626 S.E.2d 25, 28 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  The trial judge did not then recuse himself; Doe, therefore, alleged\r\n  judicial prejudice.Â  Id.Â  This Court held,  \r\n\r\n\tBecause Doe made no showing here of actual prejudice, we find no\r\n  abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to disqualify himself.Â  If anything,\r\n  the trial judge demonstrated sensitivity toward any concerns Doe might have had\r\n  regarding his impartiality by voluntarily making full disclosure of his and his\r\n  law clerkâ€™s contacts with Howe and Howeâ€™s counsel.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 441, 626 S.E.2d at 29.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nJust as in Doe, we find Husband has made no showing of\r\n  actual prejudice on behalf of Judge Segars-Andrews.Â  We find Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrewsâ€™ remarks about her concern for not disclosing the information at\r\n  the beginning of the hearing do not show any bias or prejudice but instead show\r\n  her sensitivity to any apprehension each side might have in her ability to make\r\n  a fair and impartial ruling in the case.Â   \r\nHusband also argues Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ written order denying\r\n  his request for recusal is a reversal of her earlier oral disqualification, but\r\n  we find this argument without merit.Â  Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ oral ruling\r\n  regarding recusal did not constitute a final order by the Judge, and therefore,\r\n  her final order denying Husbandâ€™s request for recusal was not a reversal of a\r\n  previous order.Â  South Carolina law is clear that â€œ[n]o order is final until it\r\n  is written and entered.â€ Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 620, 571\r\n  S.E.2d 92, 96 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œUntil written and entered, the trial judge\r\n  retains discretion to change his [or her] mind and amend his [or her] oral\r\n  ruling accordingly.â€Â  Id. at 621, 571 S.E.2d at 96.Â  A written order may\r\n  be issued which is inconsistent with a prior oral ruling, and to the extent the\r\n  two conflict, the written order controls.Â  Id. at 621, 571 S.E.2d at\r\n  97.Â  â€œThe written order . . . constitutes the final judgment of the court.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nJudge Segars-Andrews made an initial oral ruling deciding she\r\n  would recuse herself from this matter but also agreed to accept memoranda on\r\n  the issue.Â  After reviewing the memoranda and affidavits from each side,\r\n  however, she found she had no reason to recuse herself and, therefore, had a\r\n  duty to adjudicate the case.Â  Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ final, written order denied\r\n  Husbandâ€™s request for recusal.Â  The written order controls.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Having\r\n  found no evidence that could question the impartiality of Judge Segars-Andrews,\r\n  or any other reason requiring her recusal, we find Canon 3B(1) to be\r\n  controlling, which imposes a â€œduty to sit.â€Â  When disqualification is not\r\n  required, the South Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct holds, â€œA judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge . . . .â€Â  Canon 3B(1) of the Code\r\n  of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR (emphasis added).Â  This duty has been recognized\r\n  and imposed in both state and federal courts.Â  See McBeth v. Nissan\r\n    Motor Corp. U.S.A., 921 F.Supp. 1473, 1477 (D.S.C. 1996) (â€œNo judge, of\r\n  course, has a duty to sit where his impartiality might be reasonably\r\n  questioned.â€); Barritt v.

State, 709 N.W.2d 567, 579 (Mich. 2006) (â€œ[W]here the standards\r\n  governing disqualification have not been met, disqualification is not optional;\r\n  rather, it is prohibited.â€)(internal quotations and citations omitted); Â Millen\r\n    v.

Warner, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this domestic action, William Robert Simpson, Jr., (Husband) appeals the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order, arguing the family court erred in (1) its equitable\r\n  distribution of marital property; (2) finding Simpson Farms, LLC, was marital\r\n  property; (3) failing to correctly ascertain the inventory of the Buck and Bull\r\n  store; (4) failing to give Husband credit for $16,000 in monies he paid to his\r\n  former wife, Becky H. Simpson (Wife); (5) finding the partiesâ€™ residence was transmuted\r\n  into marital property; and (6) awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife were married on September 3, 1989.Â  At the time of the marriage,\r\n  Husband was nineteen and Wife was seventeen years of age.Â  During the marriage,\r\n  Wife primarily stayed at home and took care of the partiesâ€™ two children.Â  She\r\n  maintained periodic outside employment, including a job at the childrenâ€™s\r\n  private school, Clarendon Hall, for which the parties received reduced\r\n  tuition.Â   \r\nThroughout\r\n  the marriage, Husband worked as a farmer with his father, William Simpson, Sr.\r\n  (Simpson, Sr.).[1]Â \r\n  In exchange for Husband earning a nominal salary and working hard, Simpson, Sr.\r\n  awarded him a fifty percent interest in Simpson Farms.Â  Husband also bought other\r\n  property that he farmed separately from his father.Â  He financed the purchase\r\n  of the additional land in various ways.Â  At times, he farmed the land or cut\r\n  timber in order to pay the purchase price.Â  At other times, he borrowed money\r\n  from banks.Â  Â \r\nAt the beginning of the marriage, the parties purchased a mobile\r\n  home, using $6,000 Wife inherited, which was located on Simpson, Sr.â€™s\r\n  property.Â  Over time, the parties cleared the land, and in 1995, they built the\r\n  marital residence.Â  On May 15, 1996, Simpson, Sr. formally deeded the property to\r\n  Husband.Â  At the time of the final hearing, the residence had $78,600\r\n  outstanding on the mortgage.Â   \r\nIn late 2003, Wife began acting somewhat erratically and appeared\r\n  depressed.Â  Husband found Wife to be more irritable and believed she preferred\r\n  to be alone without him or the children.Â  To support Husbandâ€™s claim that Wife\r\n  was acting irrationally, he testified that when Wife returned from a trip to Florida in July 2004, she had three tattoos.Â  Eventually, Wife was diagnosed as bipolar.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Husband asked Wife for a divorce.Â   \r\nAt this point, Wife was not represented by counsel.Â  Husband took\r\n  Wife, who was accompanied by her elderly grandfather, to his attorneyâ€™s office\r\n  to sign a separation agreement.Â  Wife signed the separation agreement, which\r\n  was later approved by the family court.Â  When she signed the agreement, Wife claimed\r\n  she was unaware of the partiesâ€™ finances because Husband handled the financial\r\n  aspects of their marriage.Â  In the time frame between Husband asking Wife for a\r\n  divorce and the signing of the separation agreement, Wife began dating Wade\r\n  Ingle. Â \r\nA few months later, Wife retained counsel and moved to have the separation\r\n  agreement set aside, claiming she was undergoing psychotherapy and taking\r\n  medication at the time she signed the separation agreement.Â  She also argued\r\n  Husband had not made a full financial disclosure.Â  The family court, noting it\r\n  would not have approved the separation agreement had it known Wifeâ€™s mental\r\n  condition, set aside the agreement.Â   \r\nAfter the family court set aside the separation agreement, Husband\r\n  instituted this action seeking a divorce based upon Wifeâ€™s adultery.Â  While the\r\n  divorce proceedings were pending, Husband closed the Buck and Bull store he\r\n  operated and attempted to auction off the inventory.Â  The family court halted\r\n  the sale in order to determine the inventoryâ€™s value.Â   \r\nThe family court subsequently issued a bifurcated decree of\r\n  divorce, granting Husband a divorce based upon Wifeâ€™s adultery, which occurred\r\n  after the parties separated.Â  The family court left open all other issues,\r\n  noting, â€œThis [o]rder shall not be construed as making any finding relative to\r\n  the issues of fault of either party . . . as may affect equitable division,\r\n  custody, counsel fees, [and] suit money.â€Â  Â \r\nAfter a two-day hearing on the remaining issues, the family court\r\n  issued its final order.[2]Â \r\n  The order provided Wife was barred from alimony because of her adultery.Â  The\r\n  family court awarded Husband sixty percent of the marital property, totaling\r\n  $320,655, and awarded Wife forty percent of the marital estate, totaling\r\n  $213,876, pursuant to the family courtâ€™s consideration of the equitable\r\n  distribution statute.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered Husband to pay\r\n  half of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â   \r\nAccordingly, Husband filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to\r\n  reconsider, which the family court denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this Court has the authority to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â \r\n  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings, and we remain mindful that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses,\r\n  is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to\r\n  their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d\r\n  541, 541 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Equitable Distribution\r\nHusband argues\r\n  the family court erred in its equitable distribution of the marital property.Â \r\n  Specifically, Husband contends the family courtâ€™s equitable division attempted\r\n  to compensate Wife for her failure to receive alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  division of marital property is within the sound discretion of the family\r\n  court, and on appeal, it will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Greene\r\n    v. Greene,&nbsp;351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) imparts the family court\r\n  with fifteen factors to consider in equitably apportioning marital property.Â  The\r\n  statute vests the family court with the discretion to decide the weight to\r\n  assign various factors.Â  See id. (â€œIn making apportionment, the\r\n  court must give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate . . . .â€).Â  On\r\n  appeal, â€œthis [C]ourt looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and\r\n  it is irrelevant that this [C]ourt might have weighed specific factors\r\n  differently than the family court.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 213-14,\r\n  634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (Ct. App. 2006).Â   \r\nIn Berry v. Berry, 294 S.C. 334, 335, 364 S.E.2d 463, 464 (1988), the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order, which awarded an adulterous spouse an equal share of the marital\r\n  property, provided,  \r\n\r\n\tAlthough\r\n  it was . . . adultery that precipitated this divorce action, no deduction has\r\n  been made from her share by reason of her fault. . . . Were it not for the\r\n  length of this marriage and the fact that [she] is barred from alimony, I would\r\n  have awarded her a substantially lower percentage of the marital property.\r\n\r\nIn affirming this Courtâ€™s\r\n  reversal of the family courtâ€™s order, the Supreme Court noted, â€œ[T]he\r\n  preclusion of an alimony award to a spouse cannot be used to increase an\r\n  equitable distribution award.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, Husband alleges the family court attempted to compensate Wife through\r\n  equitable distribution because she was statutorily barred from receiving\r\n  alimony.Â  He points to what he believes is the family courtâ€™s â€œskewedâ€ factual\r\n  findings in favor of Wife to award her forty percent of the marital estate.\r\nWe find the record\r\n  fails to support Husbandâ€™s contention.Â  In its order, the family court granted\r\n  Husband a divorce based upon Wifeâ€™s adultery that took place after the parties\r\n  separated.Â  Further, the order provided, â€œThere is no evidence of marital\r\n  misconduct from either party that would rise to the level to [a]ffect the\r\n  division of property.Â  The wifeâ€™s adultery took place only after the partiesâ€™\r\n  separation.â€Â  Unlike the situation presented in Berry, the family court\r\n  specifically stated Wifeâ€™s marital misconduct did not affect the equitable\r\n  distribution.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the family court awarded Husband twenty percent more than Wife,\r\n  dividing the property in a sixty-forty split. Â The court took into\r\n  consideration the direct and indirect contributions of both parties and the\r\n  substantial â€œsweat equityâ€ of Husband. Â The award considered the appropriate\r\n  statutory factors and this Stateâ€™s public policy that a partyâ€™s marital\r\n  misconduct does not justify a severe penalty for equitable apportionment\r\n  purposes.Â  See Doe, 370 S.C. at 216, 634 S.E.2d at 57 (finding South Carolina law â€œexpressly disallow[s] fault as a penaltyâ€ in determining equitable\r\n  apportionment between a husband and wife).Â  Therefore, we agree with the family\r\n  court that a forty percent award of the marital property to Wife is proper.\r\n\r\n    II.Â Â Marital Property\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court erred in finding Simpson Farms was marital property.Â  Husband\r\n  maintains his fifty percent interest in Simpson Farms was a gift from Simpson,\r\n  Sr. and, as such, is a nonmarital asset.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ Marital property is defined as â€œall real and personal\r\n  property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which\r\n  is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . regardless\r\n  of how legal title is held.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2006). Â However,\r\n  property may be considered nonmarital if it is acquired by gift or\r\n  inheritance.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1).Â  Because of the general presumption\r\n  that property acquired during the marriage is an asset of the marriage, â€œ[t]he\r\n  burden to show an exemption under S.C. Code Ann. Section 20-7-473 is\r\n  upon the one claiming that property acquired during the marriage is not\r\n  marital.â€Â  Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 356, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1990) (citations omitted).\r\nHusband\r\n  points to the testimony of Wifeâ€™s expert, Mark Hobbs, a certified public\r\n  accountant, to show Simpson Farms was a gift from his father.Â  During Simpson,\r\n  Sr.â€™s divorce proceedings, Hobbs testified the only way Husband could have\r\n  amassed all of his property was through gift or inheritance because the income\r\n  shown on Husbandâ€™s tax returns could not support Husbandâ€™s vast land holdings.Â \r\n  During this trial, Hobbs testified he still believed his earlier conclusions to\r\n  be true.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the record, we find Husband mischaracterizes and omits much of Hobbsâ€™ testimony.Â  Although Hobbs stated he believed Husbandâ€™s interest in Simpson Farms\r\n  was a gift, he did so to highlight his belief that Husband could not have\r\n  amassed his land holdings with the little amount of income he reported on his\r\n  tax returns.Â  In fact, the very substance of Hobbsâ€™ testimony indicated\r\n  Husbandâ€™s financial records were inaccurate and incomplete.Â  Hobbs noted\r\n  Husbandâ€™s personal expenses â€œgreatly exceededâ€ the amount of money he reported\r\n  as income.Â  Further, Hobbs testified he did not see any gift tax returns filed\r\n  by Husband or Simpson, Sr. to verify Simpson Farms was a gift rather than\r\n  something Husband acquired through his hard work during the marriage.Â  In\r\n  addition, the agreement between Husband and Simpson, Sr. provides, â€œ[A]ll farm\r\n  equipment and farm land of Simpson Farms will become shared equally for\r\n  invested interest for work on [the] farm . . . .â€Â  Husbandâ€™s own testimony at\r\n  the hearing was that he worked for his interest in Simpson Farms: â€œI earned it\r\n  all, I worked for it, and he gave it to me.â€ Â \r\nThe\r\n  evidence in this case establishes Simpson Farms was marital property, and Husband\r\n  has failed to carry his burden to show otherwise.Â  During the marriage, Husband\r\n  farmed and received a nominal salary of $120 a week in exchange for an interest\r\n  in Simpson Farms.Â  Husbandâ€™s fifty percent interest in Simpson Farms was\r\n  payment for labor expended during the marriage, and therefore, the family court\r\n  properly concluded it was an asset of the marriage.\r\nIII.Â Â Inventory of Buck\r\n  and Bull  \r\nHusband avers the\r\n  family court failed to properly determine what the inventory of the Buck and\r\n  Bull store included at the time this action was commenced. Â We disagree.\r\nAlthough the sale\r\n  of the storeâ€™s inventory was halted pursuant to a court order, Husband offered\r\n  no figure during the hearing as to the inventoryâ€™s value at the time he\r\n  instituted this action. Â Therefore, we cannot determine how much this value\r\n  depleted between the filing of the action and the final hearing. Â See Honea\r\n    v. Honea,&nbsp; 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987)\r\n  (â€œWe have stated before, and we reiterate here, that a party cannot sit back at\r\n  trial without offering proof, then come to this Court complaining of the\r\n  insufficiency of the evidence to support the family courtâ€™s findings.â€).Â  Further,\r\n  even if the family courtâ€™s valuation was too low, as Husband alleges, because\r\n  the family court awarded him the inventory, we can discern no prejudice to\r\n  Husband if the inventory should be worth more than what the family court\r\n  found.Â  See McCall v. Finley,&nbsp;294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26,\r\n  28&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987) (â€œAppellate courts recognize . . . Â an overriding rule\r\n  of civil procedure which says: whatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t\r\n  matter.â€).\r\nIV.Â Â Credit\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court erred in failing to reimburse him for the $16,000 he paid to Wife\r\n  under the August 2004 separation agreement, which was later overturned by the\r\n  family court. Â In Husbandâ€™s view, the $16,000 should be treated as an advance\r\n  on the equitable distribution Wife received.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nIn support of his\r\n  contention that he is entitled to a $16,000 credit, Husband submitted a\r\n  document that listed his purported payments to Wife from August 2004 until\r\n  January 2005.Â  However, Husband failed to include any checks, bills, or\r\n  receipts that actually showed the amount he paid. Â Wife also testified that at\r\n  most, she received two payments from Husband under the agreement.Â  Considering\r\n  the family court found â€œHusbandâ€™s financial declaration and financial\r\n  disclosures [were not] accurate depictions of his actual income and assets,â€ we\r\n  find no credible evidence Husband actually paid Wife $16,000.Â  Further, the\r\n  family court considered whether Husband was entitled to a $16,000 credit and\r\n  specifically declined to give Husband any credit.Â  However, Husband did receive\r\n  twenty percent more of the marital estate, a factor the family court most\r\n  certainly considered when declining to give Husband a credit.Â  Therefore,\r\n  because we affirm the overall apportionment of the marital property, we find no\r\n  error in the family courtâ€™s failure to give Husband a credit.Â  See Deidun\r\n    v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding on\r\n  appeal, we look to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and if the end\r\n  result is equitable, it is irrelevant if we would have arrived at a different\r\n  apportionment).  \r\nV. Transmutation\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in concluding\r\n  the residence where the parties lived during the marriage was transmuted into\r\n  marital property.Â  Husband contends the land on which the marital residence was\r\n  built was a gift from Simpson, Sr. and, therefore, his separate property.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, property acquired by either party during the marriage by gift from an\r\n  individual other than the spouse is nonmarital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-473(1).Â  Nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital\r\n  property if: â€œ(1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be\r\n  untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in\r\n  support of the marriage . . . so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make\r\n  it marital property.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d\r\n  531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 86, 467\r\n  S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996)). Â Whether transmutation\r\n  of separate property into marital property has occurred â€œis a matter of intent\r\n  to be gleaned from the facts of each case.â€ Â Johnson\r\n    v. Johnson,&nbsp;296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988).\r\nAlthough the\r\n  evidence shows Husband acquired the land by gift from Simpson, Sr. during the\r\n  marriage, the parties, using funds earned during the marriage, built the\r\n  marital home.Â  Together, they cleared the land where the house was built.Â  The\r\n  residence was occupied by both the parties from the time it was built in 1995\r\n  until this action was commenced in 2004.Â  Clearly, the parties utilized the\r\n  home and land in support of the marriage.Â  See Cooper v. Cooper,\r\n  289 S.C. 377, 380, 346 S.E.2d 326, 328 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œAlthough the evidence\r\n  shows that the husband acquired the land by gift from his father during the\r\n  marriage, it also shows, and we so find, that the property lost its nonmarital\r\n  character and therefore became subject to equitable distribution when the\r\n  husband, nine years before the parties separated, erected the marital home\r\n  thereon and thereby used the 1.4 acre tract in support of the marriage.â€).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find the family court properly concluded the house was transmuted into\r\n  marital property. Â Â \r\nVI.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nLastly, Husband argues the family court erred in\r\n  awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â Â  He maintains he will be unable to\r\n  pay the fees because he has less acreage to farm as a result of the equitable\r\n  distribution.Â  He also claims Wife did not receive a beneficial result in the\r\n  litigation.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-420(38) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides, â€œSuit money,\r\n  including attorneyâ€™s fees, may be assessed for or against a party to an action\r\n  brought in or subject to the jurisdiction of the family court.â€Â  The award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the family court and absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining whether to award\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider â€œeach partyâ€™s ability to pay\r\n  his or her own fee; the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the\r\n  partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and the effect of the fee on each\r\n  partyâ€™s standard of living.â€Â  Id. (citing E.D.M. v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 476-77,\r\n  415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992)).Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the outset, we note Husband does not appeal the reasonableness of the fees and\r\n  costs, but simply that he was ordered to pay half the fees.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  need not decide whether the fee amount was proper.Â  See State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 86, 276 S.E.2d 163, 170 (1981); Rule 208(b)(1)(B),\r\n  (D), SCACR (stating an issue not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and\r\n  precludes consideration on appeal).\r\nÂ In\r\n  the final order, the family court ordered Husband to pay half of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and the cost of the certified public accountant for a total of\r\n  $83,0391.91.Â  In his brief, Husband argues his acreage has been reduced, and he\r\n  is responsible for the debt on the land the family court awarded Wife.Â \r\n  Therefore, he maintains he does not have a greater ability than Wife to pay\r\n  fees.Â  However, Husband submitted no documentation to prove the land Wife\r\n  received through equitable distribution is mortgaged.Â  The family court determined\r\n  Wife was unlikely to be able to earn more than $25,000 a year, while Husband, a\r\n  successful farmer, had the proven ability to earn $100,000 a year.[3]Â  In addition, Husband received twenty percent more of\r\n  the marital estate.Â  We agree with the family court that because Husband was\r\n  awarded substantially more assets, he will be able to pay the debts with less impact\r\n  on his standard of living.\r\nFurther,\r\n  the fact that Wife received a greater share of the marital estate after the\r\n  separation agreement was set aside is evidence of Wifeâ€™s beneficial results.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Husbandâ€™s lack of candor with the family court and failure to fully cooperate\r\n  throughout the litigation process support an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989) (finding\r\n  the wife was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs because â€œthe wifeâ€™s attorney\r\n  faced difficulty and lack of cooperation from the husband, which serve[d] as an\r\n  additional basis for the award of attorneysâ€™ feesâ€).Â  Therefore, because the\r\n  family court fully examined the necessary factors in determining Wife was\r\n  entitled to fees and costs, we can discern no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  award.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated above, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[4]Â  \r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband was also a named party in Simpson, Sr.â€™s\r\n  divorce.Â  See Simpson v. Simpson, Op. No. 2007-UP-147 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April, 4, 2007) (unpublished opinion). \r\n \r\n[2] At the hearing, both parties agreed Husband was to\r\n  have custody of the two children.Â   \r\n[3] Husbandâ€™s\r\n  first financial declaration disclosed an income of $1,730.76 per month while\r\n  his last disclosure to the court provided his income was $8,350 per month.Â  In\r\n  concluding Husband had the ability to earn $100,000 in any given year, the\r\n  family court also acknowledged Husbandâ€™s inconsistent declarations created\r\n  difficulty in ascertaining Husbandâ€™s actual income.Â   \r\n[4] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4342","title":"State v.

Â Girlfriend and Ferguson have two daughters\r\n  together and for the year preceding Victimâ€™s death, Girlfriend, Ferguson, their two daughters, and Fergusonâ€™s two children from a previous relationship had\r\n  lived together in Girlfriendâ€™s mobile home.Â  Three weeks before Victimâ€™s death,\r\n  Girlfriend and her two children moved next door into Victimâ€™s mobile home,\r\n  while Ferguson and his children from the prior relationship remained in the\r\n  first mobile homeÂ   \r\nA common well and water line served the adjacent homes.Â  Immediately\r\n  before the shooting, Girlfriendâ€™s father, George Earl, had attempted to repair\r\n  a water leak inside Victimâ€™s home and had turned off the water supply serving\r\n  both homes.[1]Â \r\n  During the repair, Earl asked someone to go out to the utility pole behind Victimâ€™s\r\n  home to switch the water back on.Â  Victim volunteered, but before she went outside,\r\n  she placed a loaded gun in the waistband of her pants.Â  While outside, Ferguson approached Victim to ask about the disruption to the water supply in his home. \r\n \r\nThe subsequent events, which culminated in Victimâ€™s death, are disputed.Â \r\n  Ferguson contends he shot Victim in self-defense after she pointed and fired\r\n  her gun at him.Â  Ferguson stated he ran toward Victim â€œin a zigzag pattern\r\n  firing my gun.â€Â  However, Girlfriend testified Ferguson appeared agitated earlier\r\n  that day.Â  She stated Ferguson began cursing at Victim before retrieving his\r\n  gun from the car.Â  Girlfriend said she tried to get Victim to go back inside her\r\n  house while Ferguson was retrieving his gun, but when Victim refused, Girlfriend\r\n  went into Victimâ€™s home and called 911 for help.Â  Girlfriend testified Ferguson started shooting his gun at Victim as he walked toward Victimâ€™s yard.Â  Witness Gary\r\n  Bryson testified he was driving by the Victimâ€™s residence when he heard a shot\r\n  and saw Ferguson and Victim in the yard.Â  Bryson saw the Victim fall to the\r\n  ground as Ferguson approached her with a gun in his hand.Â   \r\nDuring the second day of trial, in response to a question about Fergusonâ€™s behavior at the time of the shooting, Girlfriend responded that Ferguson allegedly\r\n  told her she â€œwas next.â€Â  Defense\r\n  counsel asked the court to strike Girlfriendâ€™s response as unresponsive to the\r\n  question asked.Â  Fergusonâ€™s counsel requested a mistrial, contending the court should strike Girlfriendâ€™s answer because\r\n  the State did not notify the defense, in writing and during discovery, about Fergusonâ€™s alleged statement.Â  The court\r\n  sustained Fergusonâ€™s objection, ruling Girlfriendâ€™s answer to the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  question was unresponsive. Â However, the court denied Fergusonâ€™s motion for a\r\n  mistrial, finding a curative instruction to the jury would overcome any\r\n  potential prejudice to Ferguson. Â \r\nUltimately, a jury found Ferguson guilty of murder and possession\r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial\r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Edwards, 373 S.C. 230, 236, 644 S.E.2d 66, 69 (Ct. App. 2007). Â â€œThis Court favors the exercise of wide discretion of\r\n  the trial court in determining the merits of [a mistrial] motion in each\r\n  individual case.â€Â  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 226, 522 S.E.2d\r\n  845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFerguson argues the trial court erred in denying his motion\r\n  for a mistrial following Girlfriendâ€™s testimony that he told her she â€œwas nextâ€\r\n  to be shot.Â  We disagree.  \r\nThe\r\n  â€œ[g]ranting of a mistrial is a serious and extreme measure which should only be\r\n  taken when the prejudice can be removed no other way. Â Generally, a curative\r\n  instruction to disregard the testimony is deemed to have cured any alleged\r\n  error.â€Â  State v. Edwards, 373 S.C. 230, 236, 644 S.E.2d 66, 69 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  In Edwards, the appellant argued the trial court erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a mistrial in his prosecution for criminal sexual\r\n  misconduct with a minor because the jury improperly heard evidence he hit his\r\n  wife.Â  Id.Â  We affirmed the trial court, finding (1) the prosecution had\r\n  not intentionally elicited the statement; (2) the statement was not offered for\r\n  its truth, but as â€œstate-of-mindâ€ evidence; and (3) any prejudice to Edwards\r\n  was cured by the courtâ€™s curative instruction asking the jury to disregard the\r\n  last statement given by the witness.Â  Id. at 236-37, 644 S.E.2d at 69; See\r\n    also State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 227-28, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999) (holding the trial court did not err in denying Patersonâ€™s motion\r\n  for mistrial because an extensive curative instruction â€œcured any possible error and eliminated any conceivable prejudiceâ€).Â \r\n  Â \r\nHere, Fergusonâ€™s attorney asked Girlfriend on cross-examination about\r\n  â€œwords [Ferguson] hadâ€ with her.Â  On redirect, the solicitor asked Girlfriend\r\n  to discuss her observations of Fergusonâ€™s temperament prior to the shooting; Girlfriend\r\n  testified Ferguson appeared â€œagitated.â€Â  Next, the solicitor asked Girlfriend:\r\n  â€œ[W]hen you came outside and went to your mother, what was his behavior like\r\n  then?â€Â  Girlfriend responded: â€œ[H]e was just standing there looking down at my [sic]\r\n  mother at the time.Â  And when I exited the home at the same time the police was\r\n  [sic] trying to get into the driveway.â€ Â The solicitor then asked: â€œDid he ever\r\n  exhibit that behavior towards you?â€ Â Girlfriend responded: â€œYes, he exhibited\r\n  [sic] towards me even when the police was there and they were ready to arrest\r\n  him.Â  He looked at me and told me that I was next.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\nAfter dismissing the jury, the court heard from both sides on defense\r\n  counselâ€™s objection to Girlfriendâ€™s answer.Â  The solicitor contended the\r\n  defense opened the door by asking Girlfriend to discuss Fergusonâ€™s behavior,\r\n  and that he had informed the defense about Fergusonâ€™s alleged comment a week\r\n  earlier. Â He further alleged the testimony was admissible as evidence of Fergusonâ€™s state of mind immediately after he shot Victim.Â  The court ultimately sustained\r\n  Fergusonâ€™s objection, and then heard arguments as to whether a curative\r\n  instruction to the jury would be sufficient to counter potential prejudice to Ferguson. Â Both sides submitted cases to the court, and eventually it denied Fergusonâ€™s motion for a mistrial.Â  \r\n \r\nWhen the jury returned to the courtroom, the court issued the\r\n  following curative instruction:\r\n\r\n\t[S]ometimes when matters of law come up I am required to send you\r\n  out of the courtroom because I may have to hear some testimony or hear some\r\n  arguments that you donâ€™t need to hear so that I can make a ruling on those\r\n  matters of law. Â . . . Â [B]efore th[e] break there was a question that was\r\n  asked by the solicitor that was objected to by the defense attorney.Â  And I\r\n  have sustained that objection on the grounds that the response that the witness\r\n  gave to that question was not responsive, was not responding to the question\r\n  that she was asked.Â  And I have made that ruling on the record and I would\r\n  instruct you folks right now to forget about, ignore and disabuse from your\r\n  mind the response that was given by the witness to the question that was asked\r\n  prior to the break. Â It should not play any part in your fact finding function\r\n  as a jury in this case. Â And so weâ€™re going to continue with the testimony at\r\n  this time with those instructions to you . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the trial court properly exercised its\r\n  discretion in deciding to give a curative instruction rather than granting Fergusonâ€™s motion for a mistrial.[2]Â \r\n  We additionally find the court cured any potential prejudice to Ferguson with its instruction to disregard Girlfriendâ€™s response to the question posed by\r\n  the solicitor.Â  Here, as in Edwards, the trial courtâ€™s curative\r\n  instruction was simple, and the court refrained from reiterating or emphasizing\r\n  the unresponsive answer.Â  Accordingly, we find the instruction cured any potential\r\n  prejudice, and we hold the trial court properly exercised its discretion in\r\n  denying Fergusonâ€™s motion for a mistrial.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Fergusonâ€™s convictions for\r\n  murder and possession of a\r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime are  \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]  \r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Detective Bolt testified Ferguson gave a statement to police the day after the shooting that Victim\r\n  and Girlfriend disconnected the water line in order to annoy him.Â   \r\n[2] We note that Ferguson made neither an overt\r\n  contemporaneous objection as to the sufficiency of the curative instruction,\r\n  nor a renewed motion for a mistrial after the court gave the jury the curative\r\n  instruction.Â  See State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d\r\n  903, 912 (1996) (finding the issue is not preserved for review if the objecting\r\n  party accepts the judgeâ€™s ruling and does not contemporaneously make an\r\n  additional objection to the sufficiency of the curative charge or move for a\r\n  mistrial). Â Rather, the following colloquy between the court and the attorneys\r\n  ensued:\r\n\r\n\tCourt:Â  [A]ny\r\n  exceptions to [the curative] instruction from the state?\r\n\tSolicitor:Â \r\n  No, your Honor.\r\n\tCourt:Â  Mr.\r\n  Price? (Fergusonâ€™s Counsel)\r\n\tFergusonâ€™s Counsel:Â  No, sir.\r\n\tCourt:Â  Other\r\n  than what you had already put on the record.\r\n\tFergusonâ€™s Counsel:Â  That is correct.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBecause the additional\r\n  statements between the court and Ferguson could be interpreted to satisfy the requirement\r\n  of a contemporaneous objection, we have deemed the issue preserved for\r\n  appellate review.\r\n[3]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4343","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.:Â \r\n  Michael James Franks appeals his conviction for distribution of marijuana,\r\n  contending the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the\r\n  lesser-included offense of simple possession.Â  We affirm.[1]Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 28, 2004, Agent Neysa Diana Caron\r\n  of the Pickens County Sheriffâ€™s Department, accompanied by a confidential informant,\r\n  went to a trailer at 36 Indian Creek Drive in Pickens County for the purpose of\r\n  arranging an undercover buy.Â  When they reached the address, Caron noticed a\r\n  woman at the window of the trailer facing their vehicle.Â  After the informant\r\n  spoke with the woman, who was later identified as Heather Alley, Caron exited\r\n  the vehicle, and someone admitted her and the informant into the trailer. Â Once\r\n  inside the trailer, Caron and the informant went to a back bedroom, where they\r\n  encountered Franks and Alley.\r\nFranks,\r\n  who was standing by a set of dresser drawers in the room, removed several bags\r\n  of marijuana from a drawer and told Caron and the informant that the bags were\r\n  â€œeach ounce bags.â€Â  Alley advised Caron and the informant that she had two\r\n  quarter-ounce bags and inquired what they wanted.Â  When Caron answered she\r\n  would buy a half ounce, Alley took the two bags, weighed them with hand-held\r\n  scales, and asked Franks to â€œweigh these and make sure itâ€™s right.â€Â  After Alley\r\n  tossed the bags to Franks, he weighed them, said â€œthey are fineâ€ and tossed\r\n  them back to Alley.Â  When Alley gave Caron the marijuana, Caron asked the\r\n  price, whereupon Franks answered it would be $60.00.Â  Caron then took $60.00\r\n  and paid it to Alley, who counted the money and laid it on a bed in the room.Â \r\n \r\nCaron\r\n  further testified that, when the informant asked about the possibility of\r\n  buying a larger amount, it was Franks who answered the question.Â  Alley then\r\n  wrote down both her own name and Franksâ€™s name, as well as their telephone\r\n  numbers, on a piece of paper, which she gave to Caron.Â   \r\nFranks\r\n  and Alley were arrested some time after the sale[2] and charged with distribution of marijuana.Â  After a jury trial on September\r\n  21, 2005, both were found guilty as charged.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn appellate\r\n  court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions\r\n  unless the trial court abused its discretion.â€Â  Clark v. Cantrell,\r\n  339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in\r\n  factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.Â  Id.\r\nâ€œA trial judge is required to charge a jury on a lesser\r\n  included offense if there is evidence from which it could be inferred that a\r\n  defendant committed the lesser offense rather than the greater.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 32, 340 S.E.2d 784, 785 (1986).Â  Nevertheless, â€œdue\r\n  process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given only where\r\n  the evidence warrants such an instruction.â€Â  Hopper v. Evans, 456 U.S. 605, 611 (1982).Â  â€œThe mere contention that the jury might accept the Stateâ€™s evidence\r\n  in part and reject it in part is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that\r\n  some evidence tend to show the defendant was guilty of only the lesser\r\n  offense.â€Â  State v. Geiger, 370 S.C. 600, 608, 635 S.E.2d 669, 674 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFranks argues on\r\n  appeal the trial court erred in denying his request to instruct the jury that\r\n  it could find him guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple possession of\r\n  marijuana.Â  He contends the trial courtâ€™s agreement to charge mere presence to\r\n  the jury supports an inference that, although Franks and Alley jointly\r\n  possessed the marijuana, only Alley was the distributor.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court has distinguished possession from mere presence, explaining that â€œproof of possession requires more than proof of mere\r\n  presence, and . . . the State must show defendant had dominion and control over\r\n  the thing allegedly possessed or had the right to exercise dominion and control\r\n  over it.â€Â  State v. Tabory, 260 S.C. 355, 364-65, 196 S.E.2d 111, 113\r\n  (1973).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  evidence in the present case supporting the inference that Franks had dominion\r\n  and control over the bags of marijuana that Caron purchased was as follows:Â \r\n  (1) Franks weighed the bags to be certain of the quantity that was being sold\r\n  to Caron; (2) Franks tossed the bags back to Alley, who then immediately handed\r\n  them to Caron; and (3) Franks himself told Caron how much she would have to pay\r\n  for the drugs.Â  These acts, though probative of Franksâ€™s dominion and control\r\n  of the marijuana Caron purchased, were also an integral part of the transaction\r\n  that led to his arrest.Â  We cannot conceive of any way they would support a\r\n  finding that Franks committed only the offense of possession of marijuana and\r\n  did not participate in its distribution.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Caron explained that arrests are sometimes delayed\r\n  for either additional investigation or protection of confidential informants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4344","title":"Green Tree Servicing v.

Fleming, D. Randolph Whitt, and Martha S. Phillips, all of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â \r\n  Lueveania Garvin appeals the order of the special referee holding her interest in\r\n  certain property was subject and junior to Green Treeâ€™s mortgages and that she\r\n  was not entitled to damages for trespass.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nIn\r\n  September of 1995, Garvin deeded .23 acres of property to her granddaughter, Reniata Williams.Â  The deed provided the property was to be used for\r\n  residential purposes and further provided:\r\n\r\n\tIn the event Reni[a]ta L. Garvin Williams shall fail to use said\r\n  property for residential purposes for a consecutive period of sixty (60) days\r\n  or more, the aforementioned property shall revert back to Grantor or Grantorâ€™s\r\n  heirs and assigns, in fee simple.Â  \r\n\r\nThus,\r\n  the interest Garvin transferred to Williams was a fee simple determinable while\r\n  she retained a possibility of reverter.Â   \r\nWilliams\r\n  subsequently obtained two notes secured by mortgages on the property.Â  Garvin\r\n  was not a party to these mortgages.Â  Williams had a mobile home placed on the\r\n  property.Â  The mobile home encroached onto Garvinâ€™s property by six feet.Â \r\n \r\nOn June 1, 2004, Williams wrote to Garvin that she no longer\r\n  resided on the property and in recognition of the condition in the deed, she\r\n  wished to return the property to Garvin.Â   \r\nGreen Tree then brought this action for foreclosure of the\r\n  mortgages in August of 2004.Â  In an order filed December 30, 2004, the special\r\n  referee ordered foreclosure of the mortgages.Â  Garvin was not named a party to\r\n  the action at this time.Â  In April of 2005 Garvin wrote to Green Tree stating\r\n  she would charge it $25.00 a day storage fee effective June 1, 2004 for the\r\n  mobile home on her property.Â  She explained $10.00 a day was for the part of\r\n  the mobile home on the far end of her yard previously deeded to Williams and\r\n  $15.00 a day was for the part of the mobile home that extended into her front yard.Â  \r\n \r\nGreen\r\n  Tree subsequently filed a petition for a rule to show cause requesting the\r\n  court order Garvin to show cause why she should not be bound by the previous\r\n  order and determine whether Garvinâ€™s interest was junior to Green Treeâ€™s\r\n  mortgages.Â  The court issued the rule as requested.Â  Garvin answered\r\n  asseverating Green Tree executed the mortgages with knowledge of the\r\n  possibility of reverter.Â  She also asserted a claim for trespass.Â   \r\nAfter a\r\n  hearing on the matter, the special referee held Garvin had no estate in the\r\n  property until the possibility of reverter was triggered, which was after Green\r\n  Tree had perfected its mortgage.Â  Thus, the referee held Garvinâ€™s interest in\r\n  the property was subject and junior to Green Treeâ€™s mortgage that was already\r\n  in place when she acquired an estate in the property.Â  In addition, the referee\r\n  held that as Garvin had submitted no evidence of any diminution in the market\r\n  value of her property due to the mobile homeâ€™s presence on her property, she\r\n  was not entitled to damages for trespass.Â  However, the referee did order Green\r\n  Tree to remove the trailer from Garvinâ€™s property.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Mortgages\r\nGarvin\r\n  argues the special referee erred in holding her interest in the property was\r\n  subject to and junior to Green Treeâ€™s mortgages.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nA fee simple determinable is a grant that can be cut short\r\n  when a given term expires.Â  Scott v. Brunson, 351 S.C. 313, 316, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œIt is an estate in fee â€˜with a qualification\r\n  annexed to it by which it is provided that it must determine whenever that\r\n  qualification is at an endâ€™â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation, &amp; Tourism\r\n    v. Brookgreen Gardens, 309 S.C. 388, 392, 424 S.E.2d 465, 467 (1992)\r\n  (quoting Purvis v. McElveen, 234 S.C. 94, 98, 106 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1959)).Â \r\n  The wording of the grant allows for defeasance of the grantee upon the terms,\r\n  covenants and conditions of the grant.Â  Brookgreen Gardens, 309 S.C. at 392, 424 S.E.2d at 467.Â  A possibility of reverter is the future\r\n  interest that accompanies a fee simple determinable.Â  Id.Â  In the case of a possibility of reverter, the possessory estate vests\r\n  immediately and automatically upon the happening of the event whereby the\r\n  determinable or conditional fee is terminated.Â  Batesburg-Leesville Sch.\r\n    Dist. No. 3 v. Tarrant, 293 S.C. 442, 446, 361 S.E.2d 343, 346 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987).Â   \r\nAlthough\r\n  the grantee of a fee simple determinable may transfer or assign the estate, the\r\n  determinable quality of the estate follows the transfer or assignation.Â  28\r\n  Am.Jur. 2nd Estates Â§ 30 (2000).Â  The determinable fee may be\r\n  mortgaged, subject to the qualification.Â  27 S.C. Jur. Mortgages Â§ 19(e)\r\n  (1996).Â  The creator of the estate would have to join in the mortgage to\r\n  subject the entire fee interest to the lien.Â  Id.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The deed granting\r\n  Williams the fee simple determinable estate was duly recorded and was referred\r\n  to in the mortgage.Â  Green Tree was on notice of the nature of the estate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-9-30 (2007) (stating recording of instrument is notice to\r\n  all persons, sufficient to put them upon inquiry of the purport of the filed\r\n  instrument and the property affected by the instrument); Binkley v. Rabon\r\n    Creek Watershed Conservation Dist., 348 S.C. 58, 71, 558 S.E.2d 902, 909\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (stating notice of a deed is notice of its whole contents).Â \r\n  Garvin never joined in the mortgages and the mortgages were subject to the\r\n  determinable quality of the estate.Â  When the determinable fee was terminated,\r\n  Green Treeâ€™s interest in the property terminated.Â  Therefore, the special\r\n  referee erred in holding Garvinâ€™s interest in the property was subject to Green\r\n  Treeâ€™s mortgages.Â   \r\n2.&nbsp; Trespass\r\nGarvin\r\n  argues the special referee erred in holding her claim for trespass failed as\r\n  she had not established a diminution in the market value of the property due to\r\n  placement of the mobile home on her property.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nIf a plaintiff\r\n  establishes a willful trespass, the damages from invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  legal rights will be presumed sufficient to sustain the action even though such damages may be only nominal and not capable of\r\n  measurement.Â  Hinson v. A. T. Sistare Construction Co., 236 S.C. 125,\r\n  113 S.E.2d 341, 344 (1960). Â Thus, Garvin did not need to establish a\r\n  diminution in value to her property to maintain her claim for trespass.Â  We\r\n  reverse the order of the special referee and remand the trespass claim for\r\n  further proceedings.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  special refereeâ€™s holding that Garvinâ€™s interest in the property was subject\r\n  and junior to Green Treeâ€™s mortgages.Â  We further reverse the special refereeâ€™s\r\n  ruling on Garvinâ€™s trespass claim and remand for further proceedings consistent\r\n  with this opinion.Â   \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED\r\nPIEPER, J., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4345","title":"Atkins v.

Darby Plexico, III, both of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Clifford\r\n  Atkins appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding Horace Mann Insurance Company\r\n  (Horace Mann) made him a commercially reasonable offer of underinsured motorist\r\n  (UIM) coverage, and that the underlying policy should not be reformed to\r\n  include UIM coverage up to liability limits.Â  Atkins contends Horace Mann\r\n  failed to meet its burden of proving that a meaningful offer of UIM coverage\r\n  was made.Â  We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nOn or about\r\n  December 27, 2000, Atkins purchased a 1993 Lexus.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n  contradictory as to the manner in which Atkinsâ€™ Lexus became covered by Horace\r\n  Mann.Â  The order initially states â€œthe plaintiff purchased a policy of\r\n  Insurance covering the [new] Lexus.â€Â  However, the next paragraph states Atkins\r\n  made a request â€œto add the Lexus to his existing Horace Mann policy . . . â€ After\r\n  making this request, Kevin Hunt, a new agent for Horace Mann, sent Atkins a form\r\n  entitled â€œAutomobile coverage selection/ rejection form.â€Â  Atkinsâ€™ name, date,\r\n  policy number, and the make and model of his new Lexus were already filled in\r\n  at the top of the form.Â  Just below this information, in a section titled\r\n  â€œUninsured and Underinsured Motor Vehicle Coverage Offers,â€ the form instructed\r\n  Atkins to â€œplease check the limits you want for each coverage and sign and date\r\n  your choice.Â  You must sign your name five times on this form.â€Â  Immediately\r\n  below this instruction, the form indicated that Atkinsâ€™ existing policy\r\n  liability limits were $100,000/ $300,000/ $50,000.  \r\nUnder\r\n  the heading entitled â€œUnderinsured Motor Vehicle Bodily Injury Coverage,â€ seven\r\n  choices of coverage were listed, ranging from $15,000/$30,000 to\r\n  $500,000/$1,000,000.Â  A check mark on the form indicates Atkins chose UIM\r\n  coverage in the amount of $25,000/$50,000.Â  This selection was below his policy\r\n  liability limits, but is the same amount of UIM coverage he had on his other\r\n  cars insured with Horace Mann.Â  Atkins admits he signed his name on the\r\n  signature line under the UIM section; however, Atkins contends he does not\r\n  recall writing the date beside the signature line or putting a check mark for\r\n  the levels of UIM coverage that were selected.Â  Atkins also admits that he\r\n  signed his name under the acknowledgment paragraph, indicating he had read the\r\n  explanations and offers of UM and UIM coverage.Â   \r\nOn October 22,\r\n  2003, Atkins was involved in an automobile accident with Terry Gillyard, and\r\n  suffered bodily injuries and other damages.Â  Gillyardâ€™s insurance company\r\n  tendered its liability limits to Atkins, but Atkins sought additional compensation\r\n  from Horace Mann because his damages exceeded Gillyardâ€™s coverage limits.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Atkins filed a declaratory judgment action requesting to have his\r\n  policy with Horace Mann reformed to provide him with UIM coverage equal to the\r\n  limits of his liability insurance coverage.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found Horace Mann was not entitled to the conclusive presumption\r\n  of a meaningful offer pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (Supp. 2007).Â  This\r\n  finding has not been appealed and therefore is\r\n  not before us for review. See Dreher v. Dreher, 370 S.C. 75, 78\r\n  n.1, 634 S.E.2d 646, 647 n.1 (2006) ( â€œ[A]n unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case\r\n  and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal\r\n  [.]â€) (citing In re Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 372 n.2, 468 S.E.2d 651, 652\r\n  n.2 (1996)).Â  The circuit court ultimately ruled in favor of Horace Mann,\r\n  concluding Horace Mann had carried its burden of proving that it had made a\r\n  meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Atkins pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-77-160 (2002) and Â§ 38-77-350 (Supp. 2007), and the Wannamaker Test.[1]Â \r\n  Atkins appeals this ruling, asserting the circuit court erred in holding that\r\n  Horace Mann carried its burden of proving it made a meaningful offer to\r\n  Atkins.Â  We disagree.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160,\r\n  164, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006).Â  In this case, the underlying issue involves\r\n  determination of coverage under an insurance policy, and therefore, is an\r\n  action at law.Â  Auto-Owners Ins. Co., v. Hamin, 368 S.C. 536, 540, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 683, 685 (Ct. App. 2006) (cert. granted 2007).Â  In an action at law,\r\n  tried without a jury, the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed\r\n  on appeal unless a review of the record reveals there is no evidence which\r\n  reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 237, 530 S.E.2d 896, 899 (Ct. App. 2000).  \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nWe initially note that the addition of Atkinsâ€™ Lexus\r\n  to his Horace Mann policy appears to be a â€œâ€˜changeâ€™ to an existing policy as\r\n  contemplated by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(C) (Supp. 2007), and thus a new\r\n  offer of UIM coverage is not mandated.â€ Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co.,\r\n  350 S.C. 82, 88-89, 564 S.E.2d 358, 362 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In Smith, this\r\n  court held that â€œ[a]n insurer is not required to make a new offer of UIM\r\n  coverage when an insured adds an additional vehicle to an existing automobile\r\n  insurance policy.â€Â  Id. at 89, 564 S.E.2d at 362.Â  However, since Horace\r\n  Mann made an offer of UIM coverage to Atkins, this offer must be a meaningful\r\n  offer pursuant to the statute and Wannamaker.Â  Wannamaker at 521,\r\n  354 S.E.2d at 556.Â  We find Horace Mann made a valid offer and therefore\r\n  affirm.Â   \r\nSection 38-77-160\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2002) provides automobile insurers must â€œoffer at\r\n  the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of\r\n  the insured liability coverage.â€Â  To comply with this statutory obligation, the\r\n  insurerâ€™s offer of UIM coverage must be â€œmeaningful.â€Â  Tucker v. Allstate\r\n    Ins. Co., 337 S.C. 128, 130, 522 S.E.2d 819, 820 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The\r\n  insurer bears the burden of establishing that it made a meaningful offer.Â  Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 759 (1996).Â  If\r\n  the insurer fails to comply with its statutory duty to make a meaningful offer\r\n  to the insured, the policy will be reformed by operation of law to include UIM\r\n  coverage up to the limits of liability insurance carried by the insured.Â  Id., at 404, 475 S.E.2d at 760.Â  \r\n \r\nAtkins maintains\r\n  Horace Mannâ€™s offer failed the Wannamaker test in two respects.Â  First, Atkins\r\n  asserts the offer was not made in a commercially reasonable manner because Hunt\r\n  never spoke with him directly, instead mailing him a selection/rejection form.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  The use of mail is a reasonable method of communicating with the\r\n  insured about an important business transaction.Â  Dewart v. State Farm Mut.\r\n    Auto. Ins. Co., 296 S.C. 150, 153-54, 370, S.E.2d 914, 917 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988).Â Â  Moreover, Atkins had an ongoing relationship with Horace Mann when he\r\n  purchased the Lexus.Â  He chose to call Hunt to insure his Lexus instead of\r\n  going by the agentâ€™s office, and it was apparently acceptable to him to read\r\n  the automobile coverage selection/rejection form, sign every blank, and return\r\n  it to the agent via the mail.Â  Therefore, we find that the Horace Mannâ€™s\r\n  notification process was commercially reasonable.\r\nNext, Atkins\r\n  contends that Horace Mann failed to intelligibly advise him of the nature of\r\n  underinsured motorist coverage.Â  Again, we disagree.Â  Atkins purchased exactly\r\n  the same UIM coverage for his Lexus that he had previously purchased on all his\r\n  other vehicles insured by Horace Mann.Â  In addition, Atkins properly signed the\r\n  form in the five required locations, including the lines accepting UIM coverage\r\n  at limits of 25/50 and under the paragraph acknowledging he had read the form\r\n  in its entirety.Â  The form clearly explains the nature of UIM coverage:Â \r\n  various options of UIM coverage limits are set out, every appropriate selection\r\n  is made, each signature block is signed, and the form adequately explains where\r\n  the insured is to seek out additional information if he or she has questions.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Atkins is a high school teacher, former principal, and coach of thirty-five\r\n  years with a Masterâ€™s degree and over thirty hours towards a PhD. Â Â \r\nAtkins\r\n  relies heavily on Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. to claim Horace Mann\r\n  did not intelligibly advise him of the nature of underinsured coverage.Â  Floyd\r\n    v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 626 S.E.2d 6 (2005).Â  However,\r\n  the holding in Floyd was limited to the issue of whether Nationwide was\r\n  entitled to the conclusive presumption of a meaningful offer of UIM coverage\r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.

(2) issues of material fact existed\r\n  regarding negligence on Underwoodâ€™s behalf; (3) the proximate cause of his\r\n  injury was the negligence of Underwood; (4) the doctrine of assumption of risk does\r\n  not bar recovery; and (5) the raccoon was a domestic animal rather than a wild\r\n  animal.Â  We affirm.  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nA raccoon bit Roger Singleton while he was\r\n  on George Sherer and Julie Underwoodâ€™s\r\n  jointly owned property.[1]Â \r\n  Approximately a year before this incident, Singleton rescued the raccoon from the\r\n  yard of a home where he was delivering furniture â€œbut wanted someone else to\r\n  take care of it.â€Â  Â Subsequently, Underwood agreed to take the raccoon.Â \r\n  According to Singleton, he was familiar with the raccoon from the time it was\r\n  removed from the wild and placed in Underwoodâ€™s care.Â  Indeed, Singleton â€œwould\r\n  come to [Underwoodâ€™s] home from time to time and was often around the [raccoon].Â \r\n  He would play with the raccoon and he liked it.â€Â  Singleton testified the\r\n  raccoon was neither vicious nor dangerous and had never bitten anyone prior to\r\n  the incident.\r\nThe\r\n  night before the incident, the raccoon escaped from his outdoor pen and\r\n  reappeared the next morning in a â€œdisheveledâ€ state.Â  After letting the\r\n  raccoon into the house, Underwood attempted to calm the animal by picking him\r\n  up and feeding him.Â  However, when her dog entered the room, the raccoon bit\r\n  Underwoodâ€™s arm severing an artery and median nerve.Â  Underwood was taken by\r\n  ambulance to the emergency room accompanied by her children.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  her deposition, Underwood was asked if she called anyone in her family for\r\n  help.Â  From the hospital, she first called her husband but he was out of town.Â \r\n  She called her father, Duke Singleton (Duke), to tell him she had been bitten.Â \r\n  She explained:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tAnd, so then I called my father \r\n\t\t\tand told him that he had bitten meâ€¦.&nbsp; I was very surprised at \r\n\t\t\this behavior because he had never done anything like that before, so \r\n\t\t\tI didnâ€™t know, you know, what was going on and he was in the house \r\n\t\t\tand to please go to my house and open the door so he could get out.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tOkay\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI was really worried because my \r\n\t\t\ttwo cats and my dog were in the house and I just didnâ€™t know what \r\n\t\t\this behavior would be and I didnâ€™t want them to get hurt.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tWere you in the hospital when \r\n\t\t\tyou called your dad?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tYes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAll right.&nbsp;

Iâ€™m pretty sure I told \r\n\t\t\tmy dad, donâ€™t go inside or try to catch him because I didnâ€™t know \r\n\t\t\twhat he would do, but Iâ€™mâ€¦itâ€™s really hard to remember exactly.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tMy dad would probably remember better than me.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; Prior to September \r\n\t\t\t24th of\r\n  2001, did you pretty much have an open door policy with your dad and your\r\n  brother?Â  Any by open door policy, I mean, that they could come in to your\r\n  house or show up at your house without calling for prior permission?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tYes, we all do in our family.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;

\r\n\t\t\tYes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tTo the best of your knowledge, \r\n\t\t\twould there have been any reason for Roger to believe that he was \r\n\t\t\tnot authorized to go into your home?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tNo.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tOkay. Did you have any objection \r\n\t\t\tto Roger actually going into your homeâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNo.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  learning his daughter was bitten and in the hospital, Duke called and informed\r\n  Singleton of the incident and suggested he go to Underwoodâ€™s home â€œto see what\r\n  he could do.â€Â  However, Duke advised Singleton to wait until he could arrive\r\n  â€œwith a net and some sacksâ€ and specifically instructed Singleton not to\r\n  capture the raccoon by himself. Â When Singleton arrived at Underwoodâ€™s\r\n  home, no one was home, and his father had not yet arrived.Â  Â Despite his\r\n  fatherâ€™s warning, Singleton entered the home and proceeded into the room where\r\n  the raccoon was located.Â  Singleton confronted the raccoon and attempted to\r\n  â€œsoothe the animal with his voice.â€Â  During Singletonâ€™s attempt to calm the\r\n  raccoon, â€œthe animal attacked him and bit him on the hand.â€Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, Duke arrived and Singleton made another effort to capture the\r\n  raccoon with the burlap sack his father provided.Â  While Singleton was\r\n  successful in capturing the raccoon, â€œthe raccoon bit Singleton a second time\r\n  through the bag.â€  \r\nAt\r\n  his deposition, Singleton explained his arrival at Underwoodâ€™s house:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDid [Underwood and Sherer] know you were going\r\n  into their house?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t know.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid they ask you to go into \r\n\t\t\ttheir house?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe phone call that I had was \r\n\t\t\tfrom my father.&nbsp; I never spoke with them.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAll right, so the answer isâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI would walk into their house on \r\n\t\t\ta regular basis without knocking.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tI understand.&nbsp; I just \r\n\t\t\twanted to make sure that we understand on this particular day they, \r\n\t\t\teither of them, asked you to come to their house?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI didnâ€™t speak directly to \r\n\t\t\teither one of them.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe person who had asked you to \r\n\t\t\tgo was your father?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tCorrect.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tNow, you say you had a practice \r\n\t\t\tof walking into their house uninvited?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAbsolutely.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSubsequently, Singleton filed a complaint against Sherer and\r\n  Underwood for the injuries he sustained from the raccoon bite while on their jointly owned property.Â  The trial court granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Sherer and Underwood, reasoning (1) Singletonâ€™s\r\n  status on the property at the time of the incident was â€œat bestâ€ a social guest\r\n  or licensee and the duty owed to a licensee is much less than the duty owed to\r\n  an invitee; (2) Singleton failed to prove any negligence on the part of\r\n  Underwood because there was no evidence the raccoon was vicious prior to the\r\n  day of the incident; (3) the acts and conduct of Singleton were the proximate\r\n  cause of his injury; and (4) the true cause of Singletonâ€™s injury was his\r\n  voluntarily exposure to a known risk.Â  Singleton filed a motion to alter or\r\n  amend judgment, challenging both the trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding his â€œlicenseeâ€\r\n  status and the trial courtâ€™s application of the assumption of risk defense.Â  Singletonâ€™s\r\n  motion was denied.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  reviewing the grant of summary judgment, [an appellate court] applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP: summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Pittman v. Grand Strand\r\n    Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005); Young v.\r\n      South Carolina Depâ€™t of Disabilities &amp; Special Needs, 374 S.C. 360, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 488 (2007); Henderson v.

Â In determining whether any\r\n  triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences that can reasonably\r\n  be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.

Â Even when there is no dispute as to\r\n  evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn\r\n  from them, summary judgment should be denied. Â Montgomery v.

Â When reasonable minds cannot differ on plain, palpable,\r\n  and indisputable facts, summary judgment should be granted. Â Ellis v.\r\n    Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The party seeking\r\n  summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact.Â  Bradley v.

Â Once the party moving for summary judgment\r\n  meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the\r\n  opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials\r\n  contained in the pleadings. Â Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582\r\n  S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003). Â The nonmoving party must come forward with\r\n  specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Â Rife, 363\r\n  S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do\r\n  not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  Dawkins v.

Life Ins.\r\n    Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct.

Licensee\r\nSingleton\r\n  argues the trial court erred in deducing he was a licensee, not an invitee, while\r\n  on Underwoodâ€™s property the day of the incident.Â  We disagree.\r\nA licensee is a person who is privileged\r\n  to enter or remain upon land by virtue of the possessorâ€™s consent.Â  Neil v. Byrum, 288 S.C. 472, 473, 343 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1986).Â  When a licensee enters onto the property of another, the\r\n  primary benefit is to the licensee, not the property owner.Â  Hoover v. Broome, 324 S.C. 531, 535, 479 S.E.2d 62,\r\n    65 (Ct. App. 1996); Landry v. Hilton Head Plantation Prop. Ownerâ€™s\r\n      Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 200, 203, 452 S.E.2d 619, 621 (Ct. App. 1994). Â A licensee is a person\r\n  whose presence is tolerated, a person not necessarily invited on the premises,\r\n  but one who is privileged to enter or remain on the premises only by the\r\n  property ownerâ€™s express or implied\r\n  consent.Â  Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 720, 541 S.E.2d 857, 864 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  While the most common example of a licensee is the social guest,\r\n  â€œ[a]n injured person has been held to be a licensee where he entered premises\r\n  to seek a favor, to make inquiries or ask directions, to do volunteer work, to\r\n  use recreational facilities without asking specific permission, to recover an\r\n  item of personal property left on the premises, to obtain some article of value\r\n  given to the licensee by the occupant, or while chasing his dog.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œ[An invitee is a person] who enters onto the property\r\n  of another by express or implied invitation, his entry is connected with the\r\n  ownerâ€™s business or with an activity the owner conducts or permits to be\r\n  conducted on his land, and there is a mutuality of benefit or a benefit to the owner.â€Â  Sims,\r\n  343 S.C. at 716-17, 541 S.E.2d at 862; see also Parker v. Stevenson\r\n    Oil Co., 245 S.C. 275, 280, 140 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1965) (noting when an\r\n  invitee enters onto the property of another, the primary benefit is to the\r\n  property owner, not the invitee); Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist\r\n    Church, 329 S.C. 433, 441, 494 S.E.2d 827, 831 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œ[A]n\r\n  invitee is a person who enters onto the property of another at the express or\r\n  implied invitation of the property owner.â€).Â  The law recognizes two types of invitees: the public invitee\r\n  and the business visitor.Â  Sims, 343 S.C. at 717, 541 S.E.2d at 862.Â  â€œA\r\n  public invitee is one who is invited to enter or remain on the land as a member\r\n  of the public for a purpose for which the land is held open to the public.â€Â  Goode,\r\n  329 S.C. at 441, 494 S.E.2d at 831; Sims, 343 S.C. at 717, 541 S.E.2d at\r\n  862.Â  In contrast, a business visitor is an invitee whose purpose for entering\r\n  the property is either directly or indirectly connected with the purpose for\r\n  which the property owner uses the land.Â  Parker, 245 S.C. at 280, 140\r\n  S.E.2d at 179; Sims, 343 S.C. at 717, 541 S.E.2d at 862; Goode,\r\n  329 S.C. at 441, 494 S.E.2d at 831; Hoover, 324 S.C. at 535, 479 S.E.2d at\r\n  65.Â  â€œ[T]he class of persons qualifying as business visitors is not limited to\r\n  those coming upon the land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with\r\n  the business conducted thereon by the possessor, but includes as well those\r\n  coming upon the land for a purpose connected with their own business, which\r\n  itself is directly or indirectly connected with a purpose for which the\r\n  possessor uses the land.â€Â  62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises Liability Â§ 88 (1990).\r\nSingleton\r\n  was a licensee while on Underwoodâ€™s property the day of the incident.Â  By his\r\n  own admission, Singleton did not enter Underwoodâ€™s property through an express\r\n  or implied invitation.Â  Rather, Singleton voluntarily entered the premises in\r\n  an effort to capture the raccoon regardless of specific instructions to the\r\n  contrary. Â Thus, as described in Sims, 343\r\n  S.C. at 720, 541 S.E.2d at 864, Singleton was on Underwoodâ€™s property performing\r\n  â€œvolunteer work,â€ which is an activity traditionally associated with the\r\n  licensee status.\r\nII.&nbsp; Duty Owed to Licensees and\r\n  Invitees \r\nSingleton\r\n  maintains the trial court erred in asseverating there was no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact regarding Underwoodâ€™s contributory negligence.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Singleton argues Underwood breached her duty to warn of any hidden and latent\r\n  dangers posed by the raccoon.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo establish negligence in a premises liability action, a\r\n  plaintiff must prove the following three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by\r\n  defendant to plaintiff; (2) defendantâ€™s breach of that duty by a negligent act\r\n  or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.Â  See Hurst v. East Coast Hockey League, Inc., 271 S.C. 33, 37, 637\r\n  S.E.2d 560, 562 (2006).Â  The court must determine, as a matter of law, whether\r\n  the law recognizes a particular duty.Â  Id.Â  â€œIf there is no duty, then\r\n  the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to summary judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.â€Â  Id.; see also Hopson v. Clary, 321 S.C.\r\n  312, 314, 468 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œIf the evidence as a whole is\r\n  susceptible to only one reasonable inference, no jury issue is created and [summary\r\n  judgment] is properly granted.â€).Â  \r\nThe nature and scope of duty in a premises liability action, if\r\n  any, is determined based upon the status or classification of the person injured\r\n  at the time of his or her injury.Â  Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 715, 541\r\n  S.E.2d 857, 861 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  South Carolina recognizes four general\r\n  classifications of persons present on the property of another: adult\r\n  trespassers, invitees, licensees, and children.Â  Id.Â  Different standards\r\n  of care apply depending upon the classification of the person present.Â  Id.; see also Larimore v.\r\n    Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 444, 531 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe level of care owed is dependent upon the class\r\n  of the person present.â€).Â  Thus, Underwoodâ€™s duty to protect Singleton from\r\n  conditions on the property largely depends on whether Singleton was a licensee or\r\n  an invitee at the time of the incident.Â  See Landry v. Hilton\r\n    Head Plantation Prop.\r\n    Owners Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 200, 203, 452 S.E.2d 619, 621 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n \r\nA.&nbsp; Licensees \r\nUnder South Carolina jurisprudence, â€œa landowner owes a licensee a\r\n  duty to use reasonable care to discover the licensee, to conduct activities on\r\n  the land so as not to harm the licensee, and to warn the licensee of any\r\n  concealed dangerous conditions or\r\n  activities.â€Â  Landry, 317 S.C. at 203, 452 S.E.2d at 621; see Neil\r\n    v. Byrum, 288 S.C. 472, 473, 343 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1986).Â  The duty owed to a licensee differs from the duty owed to an\r\n  invitee â€œin that the [landowner] has no duty to search out and discover dangers\r\n  or defects in the land or to otherwise make the premises safe for a licensee.â€Â \r\n  18 S.C. Jur. Negligence Â§ 44 (2007); see Landry,\r\n  317 S.C. at 203, 452 S.E.2d at 621.Â  As the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court explained in Neil v. Byrum:  \r\n\r\n\tThe [owner or possessor of land] is under no obligation to\r\n  exercise care to make the premises safe for his reception, and is under no duty\r\n  toward him except:\r\n\t(a) To use reasonable care to discover him and avoid injury to him\r\n  in carrying on activities upon the land.\r\n\t(b) To use reasonable care to warn him of any concealed\r\n  dangerous conditions or activities which are known to\r\n  the possessor, or of any change in the condition of the premises which may be\r\n  dangerous to him, and which he may reasonably be expected to discover.\r\n\r\n288 S.C. at 473, 343 S.E.2d\r\n  at 616 (emphasis in original).Â  â€œ[S]ince a licensee is there for his own benefit, he can be\r\n  said to accept the premises as they are and demand no greater safety than his\r\n  host provides himself.â€Â  F.P Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina\r\n    Law of Torts 111-12 (2d ed. 1997).  \r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, Underwood owed no duty to Singleton as a\r\n  licensee because Singleton did not enter Underwoodâ€™s property through an\r\n  express or implied invitation.Â  Rather, Singleton voluntarily entered the\r\n  premises in an effort to capture the raccoon in contrariety to his specific\r\n  instructions.Â  Under these circumstances, Underwood owed Singleton no duty\r\n  greater than the duty she owed to herself.Â  See Neil, 288 S.C. at\r\n  473, 343 S.E.2d at 616.\r\nB.&nbsp; Invitees\r\nGenerally, the owner of property owes an invitee or business\r\n  visitor the duty of exercising reasonable or ordinary care for his safety and\r\n  is liable for injuries resulting from the breach of such duty.Â  Larimore v.\r\n    Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 444, 531 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Thus, unlike a licensee,\r\n  an invitee enters the premises with the implied assurance of preparation and\r\n  reasonable care for his protection and safety while he is there.Â  Landry, 317 S.C. at 203, 452 S.E.2d at 621; Bryant v. City of North Charleston,\r\n  304 S.C. 123, 125, 403 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In addressing\r\n  premises liability as it relates to an invitee, the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court expressly adopted section 343A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965)\r\n  in Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C. 123, 126, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 361, 362 (1991).Â  Section 343A provides:\r\n\r\n\tÂ§ 343A. Known or Obvious Dangers\r\n\t(1) A possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical\r\n  harm caused to them by any activity or condition on the land whose danger is\r\n  known or obvious to them, unless the possessor should anticipate the harm\r\n  despite such knowledge or obviousness.\r\n\t(2) In determining whether the possessor should anticipate harm\r\n  from a known or obvious danger, the fact that the invitee is entitled to make\r\n  use of public land, or of the facilities of a public utility, is a factor of\r\n  importance indicating that the harm should be anticipated.\r\n\r\nComment e to section 343A further elaborates:  \r\n\r\n\tIn the ordinary case, an invitee who enters land is entitled to\r\n  nothing more than knowledge of the conditions and dangers he will encounter if\r\n  he comes.Â  If he knows the actual conditions, and the activities carried on,\r\n  and the dangers involved in either, he is free to make an intelligent choice as\r\n  to whether the advantage to be gained is sufficient to justify him in incurring\r\n  the risk by entering or remaining on the land.Â  The possessor of the land may\r\n  reasonably assume that he will protect himself by the exercise of ordinary\r\n  care, or that he will voluntarily assume the risk of harm if he does not\r\n  succeed in doing so. Reasonable care on the part of the possessor therefore\r\n  does not ordinarily require precautions, or even warning, against dangers which\r\n  are known to the visitor, or so obvious to him that he may be expected to\r\n  discover them.\r\n\r\nBased\r\n  upon the language of section 343A, Singleton asserts Underwood had a duty to\r\n  warn him of the dangerous conditions posed by the raccoon regardless of his\r\n  status as a licensee or invitee at the time of the incident.Â  However, contrary to Singletonâ€™s argument, the raccoon did not pose\r\n  a hidden or latent danger about which Underwood had an affirmative duty to warn\r\n  Singleton.Â  As evidenced by the record, Singleton was aware the raccoon\r\n  had bitten Underwood prior to his arrival at her home. Â Notwithstanding this\r\n  knowledge, Singleton entered the home and voluntarily exposed himself to any\r\n  potential danger posed by the raccoon.Â  Thus, as a matter of law, Underwood had\r\n  no duty to warn Singleton of the known and obvious danger posed by the raccoon\r\n  regardless of his status as licensee or invitee.Â  See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 343A.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Proximate Cause\r\nSingleton\r\n  proclaims the trial court erred in declaring there was no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to whether Underwoodâ€™s actions proximately caused his\r\n  injuries.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\t[P]roximate cause is the efficient, or direct, cause â€“ the thing\r\n  which brings about the injuries complained of.Â  Negligence is not actionable\r\n  unless it is a proximate cause of the injuries, and it may be deemed a\r\n  proximate cause only when without such negligence the injury would not have\r\n  occurred or could have been avoided.Â  \r\n\r\nHughes v. Childrenâ€™s\r\n  Clinic, P.A., 269 S.C. 389, 398, 237 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1977).Â  Proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact\r\n  and legal cause.Â  Oliver v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp.,\r\n  309 S.C. 313, 316, 422 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992).Â  Causation in fact is proved by\r\n  establishing the plaintiffâ€™s injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the\r\n  defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Id.Â  Legal cause is proved by establishing\r\n  foreseeability.Â  Id.Â  â€œForeseeability is determined by looking to the\r\n  natural and probable consequences of the act complained of. A plaintiff\r\n  therefore proves legal cause by establishing the injury in question occurred as\r\n  a natural and probable consequence of the defendantâ€™s negligence.â€Â  Vinson\r\n    v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 400, 477 S.E.2d 715, 721 (citations omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Singleton fails to prove any negligent act or omission\r\n  attributable to Underwood as the proximate cause of his injury.Â  First, the\r\n  record contains no evidence but for Underwoodâ€™s failure to warn Singleton, he\r\n  would not have sustained injury.Â  By his own admission, Singleton was aware the\r\n  raccoon had bitten Underwood prior to his arrival and was warned by his father\r\n  â€œnot to try and catch the raccoon by himself.â€Â  Singleton entered Underwoodâ€™s home\r\n  and voluntarily exposed himself to the danger posed by the raccoon.Â  The fact\r\n  Singleton attempted to capture the raccoon in spite of his fatherâ€™s warning refutes\r\n  any contention he would have proceeded differently and not sustained injury if\r\n  Underwood warned him.Â   \r\n\r\n  The record contains no evidence Singletonâ€™s injury was foreseeable,\r\n  as required to establish legal cause.Â  Underwood had no notice the raccoonâ€™s\r\n  attack on Singleton was going to occur.Â  As evidenced by the record, Underwood\r\n  was hospitalized on the day of the incident and never invited Singleton to enter\r\n  the property during her absence.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Underwood had no reason to foresee Singleton would\r\n  enter her home and attempt to capture the raccoon.Â  Contrary to Singletonâ€™s\r\n  contention, the evidence negates the existence of both causation in fact\r\n  and legal cause as a matter of law.Â  The trial court\r\n  did not err in holding there was no genuine issue of material fact as to\r\n  the proximate cause of Singletonâ€™s injuries.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Assumption of Risk \r\nSingleton avers the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\r\n  against him based upon the doctrine of assumption of risk, arguing (1)\r\n  assumption of risk is no longer a complete defense to a negligence action since\r\n  our Supreme Courtâ€™s adoption of comparative negligence, and (2) whether Singleton\r\n  assumed the risk was a question of fact the trial court should have submitted\r\n  to the jury.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Assumption of Risk in South\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s Comparative Negligence Â System\r\nThe\r\n  threshold issue we must determine is whether assumption of risk serves as a\r\n  complete bar to recovery under South Carolinaâ€™s comparative negligence system.Â \r\n  In Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 245, 399 S.E.2d 783, 784\r\n  (1991), the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted a modified version of\r\n  comparative negligence known as the â€œless than or equal toâ€ approach.Â  Under\r\n  this version, â€œ[f]or all causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1991, a\r\n  plaintiff in a negligence action may recover damages if his or her negligence\r\n  is not greater than that of the defendant.â€Â  Id.Â  Pellucidly, under Nelson, a plaintiffâ€™s contributory\r\n  negligence does not bar recovery unless such negligence exceeded that of the\r\n  defendant.Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œAssumption of the risk is the deliberate and voluntary choice to\r\n  assume a known risk.â€Â  Baxley v. Rosenblum, 303 S.C. 340, 347, 400 S.E.2d\r\n  502, 507 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The doctrine of assumption of the risk embodies the\r\n  principle plaintiffs may not recover for injuries received when they\r\n  voluntarily expose themselves to a known and appreciated danger. Lowrimore\r\n    v. Fast Fare Stores, Inc., 299 S.C. 418, 424, 385 S.E.2d 218, 221 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989).Â  South Carolina first adopted assumption of risk within the context of\r\n  the master-servant relationship, whereby the agreement to become employed\r\n  included the agreement to assume the risks associated with employment.Â  See Hooper\r\n    v. Columbia &amp; Greenville R.R. Co., 21 S.C. 541, 547 (1884).Â  While the South Carolina Supreme Court ultimately\r\n  extended the assumption of risk defense to negligence cases outside the\r\n  master-servant relationship, the defense is applied less often in its\r\n  traditional context because of Workersâ€™ Compensation laws.Â  See, e.g., Smith\r\n    v. Edwards, 186 S.C. 186, 191, 195 S.E. 236, 238 (1938) (â€œ[Assumption of\r\n  risk] applies to any case . . . Â where the facts proved show that the person\r\n  against whom the doctrine of assumption of risk is pleaded knew of the danger,\r\n  appreciated it, and acquiesced therein.â€). Â \r\nIn Davenport v. Cotton Hope\r\n  Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 325 S.C. 507, 513-14, 482 S.E.2d 569, 574 (Ct. App. 1997), this court held\r\n  assumption of risk had been subsumed by South Carolinaâ€™s adoption of comparative\r\n  negligence.Â  Consequently, assumption of risk no longer served as a complete\r\n  bar to a negligence claim; rather, the defense was simply another factor to\r\n  consider in comparing the partiesâ€™ negligence.Â  Id.Â  In later reviewing Davenport, our supreme court analyzed the continuing viability of assumption of\r\n  risk in South Carolinaâ€™s comparative negligence system.Â  According to the South Carolina Supreme Court:\r\n\r\n\tIt is contrary to the premise of our comparative fault system to\r\n  require a plaintiff, who is fifty-percent or less at fault, to bear all of the\r\n  costs of the injury. Â In accord with this logic, the defendantâ€™s fault in\r\n  causing an accident is not diminished solely because the plaintiff knowingly\r\n  assumes a risk. Â If assumption of risk is retained in its current common law\r\n  form, a plaintiff would be completely barred from recovery even if his conduct\r\n  is reasonable or only slightly unreasonable. Â In our comparative fault system,\r\n  it would be incongruous to absolve the defendant of all liability based only on\r\n  whether the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury. Â Comparative negligence by\r\n  definition seeks to assess and compare the negligence of both the plaintiff and\r\n  defendant. Â This goal would clearly be thwarted by adhering to the common law\r\n  defense of assumption of risk.\r\n\r\nDavenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal\r\n  Property Regime, 333 S.C.\r\n  71, 86, 508 S.E.2d 565, 573 (1998).Â  Based\r\n  upon the foregoing, our supreme court concluded â€œa plaintiff is not barred from\r\n  recovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless the degree of fault\r\n  arising therefrom is greater than the negligence of the defendant.â€ Â Â Id. at 87, 508 S.E.2d at 573-74. \r\n \r\nApplying this\r\n  analysis to the case sub judice, we agree with Singletonâ€™s\r\n  assertion assumption of risk is no longer a complete\r\n  bar to recovery under South Carolinaâ€™s comparative negligence system. Â This\r\n  determination is made by the court as a matter of law where\r\n  the degree of fault arising from the plaintiffâ€™s assumption of risk exceeds any\r\n  negligence on the part of the defendant.Â  See, e.g., Bloom v. Ravoira,\r\n  339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2000) (finding, as a matter of law,\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s own negligence was greater than any potential negligence by\r\n  defendant, thus precluding his recovery in a negligence action); Estate of\r\n    Haley v. Brown, 370 S.C. 240, 243, 634 S.E.2d 62, 63 (Ct. App. 2006) (directed\r\n  verdict proper where the â€œonly reasonable inference\r\n  that can be drawn from the evidence is that [plaintiffâ€™s] negligence in running\r\n  into the side of [defendantâ€™s] truck outweighed any possible negligence by\r\n  [defendant] and was the more determinative factor in causing the collision.â€); Hopson\r\n    v. Clary, 321 S.C. 312,\r\n  316, 468 S.E.2d 305, 308 (Ct. App. 1996) (where plaintiffâ€™s negligence was, as\r\n  a matter of law, greater than defendantâ€™s, trial court correctly concluded\r\n  doctrine of comparative negligence barred claim).Â  We must determine whether\r\n  Singletonâ€™s assumption of risk was, as a matter of law, greater than any negligence\r\n  attributable to Underwood and the more determinative factor in causing his\r\n  injuries.Â Â   \r\nB.&nbsp; Singletonâ€™s\r\n  Assumption of Risk\r\nDavenport edifies: there are four requirements necessary to\r\n  establish the assumption of risk defense in South Carolina: (1) the plaintiff\r\n  must have knowledge of the fact constituting a dangerous condition; (2) the\r\n  plaintiff must know the condition is dangerous; (3) the plaintiff must\r\n  appreciate the nature and extent of the danger; and (4) the plaintiff must\r\n  voluntarily expose himself or herself to the danger.Â  333\r\n  S.C. at 78-79, 508 S.E.2d at 569.Â  â€œThe doctrine is predicated on the factual\r\n  situation of a defendantâ€™s acts alone creating the danger and causing the\r\n  accident, with the plaintiffâ€™s act being that of voluntarily exposing himself\r\n  to such an obvious danger with appreciation thereof which resulted in the\r\n  injury.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, assumption of risk may be implied from the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s conduct.Â  Id. \r\nThe undisputed facts establish Singleton freely and voluntarily\r\n  exposed himself to a known danger which he understood and appreciated.Â  By\r\n  Singletonâ€™s own admission, his actions on the day of the incident were â€œpretty\r\n  stupid.â€Â  Any factual issues which might exist as to Sherer and Underwoodâ€™s contributory\r\n  negligence cannot alter the inescapable conclusion Singletonâ€™s negligence\r\n  exceeded fifty percent. Under South Carolina jurisprudence, where evidence of\r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s greater negligence is overwhelming, evidence of slight\r\n  negligence on the part of the defendant is simply not enough for a case to go\r\n  to the jury.Â  See Hopson v.\r\n    Clary, 321 S.C. 312, 314, 468 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996) (noting where the evidence as a whole is susceptible to only one\r\n  reasonable inference, no jury issue is created).Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in barring Singletonâ€™s claim under the assumption of risk doctrine because\r\n  Singleton was more than fifty percent at fault in causing\r\n  his injuries.  \r\nV.&nbsp; The Raccoon: A Wild Animal \r\nSingleton\r\n  maintains the trial court erred by deciding the raccoon was a wild animal rather\r\n  than a domesticated animal.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  In order for an issue to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359\r\n  S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004); see also In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal,\r\n  it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  In\r\n  the present case, the record contains no indication the trial court ruled on the\r\n  issue of the raccoonâ€™s domestication.Â  While pled and argued, the\r\n  final order does not address the domestication of the raccoon because Singleton\r\n  did not assert a cause of action on the basis of liability for injuries caused\r\n  by a â€œdomesticated animalâ€ pursuant to section 47-5-20(3) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2007).Â   \r\nMoreover, Singleton did not file\r\n  a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, requesting a ruling on this issue.Â  As noted by our supreme court, â€œ[e]ven after an order is filed, counsel has an obligation\r\n  to review the order and file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend if\r\n  the order fails to set forth the findings and the reasons for those findings as\r\n  required by section 17-27-80 of the South Carolina Code and Rule 52(a), SCRCP.â€Â  Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 256, 423 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1992).Â  Singletonâ€™s\r\n  claims regarding domestication of the raccoon are not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â   \r\nAverring\r\n  to the merits, the South Carolina Supreme Court set\r\n  out the common law rule regarding liability for injuries caused by domestic\r\n  animals in Mungo v. Bennett, 238 S.C. 79, 81, 119 S.E.2d 522, 523\r\n  (1961).Â  According to the Mungo court:  \r\n\r\n\t[A]ll domestic animals, whether horses,\r\n  mules, cattle, dogs, cats or others, are not presumed to be dangerous to\r\n  persons, and before recovery of damages may be had against the owner the\r\n  injured party must prove that the particular animal was of a dangerous, or\r\n  vicious, nature and that this dangerous propensity was either known, or should\r\n  have been known to the owner.\r\n\r\nId.; see also S.C. Code Â§ 47-5-20(3)\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (â€œ[Domesticated animal] means owned or stray cats, dogs, and\r\n  ferrets or other animals for which there exists a rabies vaccine approved by\r\n  the department and licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nIt\r\n  should be noted, Mungo is no longer the law regarding liability for\r\n  injuries arising from dogs.Â  In Hossenlopp By and Through Hossenlop v.\r\n    Cannon, 285 S.C. 367, 329 S.E.2d 438 (1985), our supreme court adopted the\r\n  law of California, which did not require knowledge of a vicious\r\n  propensity before liability attached to a dog owner.Â  Id. at 372, 329\r\n  S.E.2d at 441.Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-100 (1987) (imposing\r\n  strict liability on dog owner for damages arising when person, while lawfully\r\n  on ownerâ€™s property, is bitten or otherwise attacked by dog).\r\nAs evidenced by his testimony, Singleton\r\n  was familiar with the raccoon from the time it was removed from the wild and\r\n  placed in Underwoodâ€™s care.Â  Singleton professed the raccoon was neither\r\n  vicious nor dangerous and had never bitten anyone prior to the incident.Â  By\r\n  Singletonâ€™s own admission, the raccoon was not â€œof a\r\n  dangerous or vicious natureâ€ which â€œwas either known or should have been knownâ€\r\n  to Underwood.Â  Mungo, 238 S.C. at 81, 119 S.E.2d at 523.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSingleton failed to present any evidence establishing negligence on\r\n  the part of Underwood.Â  Assumptively concluding that Underwood was guilty of\r\n  some negligent act, Singletonâ€™s own negligence was, as a matter of law, greater\r\n  than any negligence attributable to Underwood.Â  We rule Singletonâ€™s claim was\r\n  barred under the doctrine of comparative negligence.Â  We hold the acts and\r\n  conduct of Singleton constituted the sole proximate cause of his injuries.Â  The raccoon was a wild animal rather than a\r\n  domesticated animal.Â  The decision of the trial court\r\n  is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant, Roger Singleton, is the brother of\r\n  Respondent, Julie Underwood, and former brother-in-law of Respondent, George\r\n  Sherer.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4347","title":"Watters v.

Ferri, both of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This case arises from the sale of a moisture-damaged home from\r\n  John Furlow to Timothy J. Watters in April of 1997.Â  Terminix Service, Inc.\r\n  provided at closing what is customarily referred to as a â€œtermite letter.â€Â  In\r\n  December of 2002, Watters filed an action against Furlow and Terminix claiming\r\n  defendants failed to disclose the moisture damage. Â The trial court granted\r\n  summary judgment to Furlow and Terminix based on the statute of limitations.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nI.\r\nWatters purchased a home from Furlow in April 1997.Â  As part of the purchase process, Terminix\r\n  completed a CL-100 Report, also known as a termite letter, and it was presented\r\n  to Watters at closing.Â  Terminix noted there was evidence of inactive wood\r\n  destroying fungi, an acceptable moisture level, and previous treatment of the\r\n  property for termite control.Â  Terminix also suggested a qualified building\r\n  inspector evaluate the structural integrity of the house.Â  Watters hired\r\n  American Inspection Service, Inc. to conduct a home inspection, and\r\n  subsequently he purchased the home.\r\nAfter the closing, Watters made numerous\r\n  repairs to the home.Â  Following another inspection, Wattersâ€™ attorney\r\n  wrote Terminix a letter on May 15, 1997, indicating an examination of the house\r\n  disclosed damage not reported at the closing.\r\nIn\r\n  August 1998, Watters hired Russell A. Rosen to evaluate the moisture level.Â \r\n  Rosenâ€™s inspection revealed the sub-floor plywood was delaminated and a\r\n  moisture problem existed in the crawl space.Â  Rosen opined that the source of\r\n  the sub-floor damage was related to installation and ductwork alterations\r\n  performed by Smoakâ€™s Air Conditioning.Â  Watters pursued a claim against\r\n  Smoakâ€™s, which resulted in Smoakâ€™s paying a settlement of $72,000.\r\nOn\r\n  December 30, 2002, Watters brought the current lawsuit for fraud, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, and indemnification alleging Furlow and Terminix failed to\r\n  disclose the moisture damage.Â  The trial court determined that Watters filed\r\n  this action outside the statute of limitations and granted summary judgment to\r\n  Furlow and Terminix.\r\nII.\r\nA\r\n  cause of action for damage to real property must be brought within three years\r\n  of when the damage occurred.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(3) (2005).Â  An\r\n  exception lies in the discovery rule, which tolls the starting of the statute\r\n  of limitations until a person discovers or should have known through reasonable\r\n  diligence that a potential claim might exist.Â  S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005); Barr v. City of Rock Hill, 330 S.C. 640, 644-45, 500 S.E.2d 157, 160\r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nFor purposes of commencement of the statute of limitations,\r\n  Watters likely received notice of a potential cause of action at closing when\r\n  he received the Terminix report together\r\n  with the suggestion by Terminix\r\n  for an evaluation of the homeâ€™s structural integrity by a qualified building\r\n  inspector.Â  Under\r\n  the summary judgment standard, we give Watters every benefit of the doubt. Â See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (limiting the issuance of summary judgment to cases where â€œthere\r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material factâ€); Koester\r\n    v. Carolina Rental Center, Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394\r\n  (1994) (â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence\r\n  and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€).\r\nEven\r\n  measured against the exacting summary judgment standard, it seems an\r\n  insurmountable hurdle for Watters to delay the start of the statute of\r\n  limitations after his attorneyâ€™s May 15, 1997 letter to Terminix\r\n  referencing the moisture damage.Â  At that time, when viewed objectively, one\r\n  would reasonably conclude that a claim might exist.Â  Nevertheless, under no circumstances could\r\n  Watters claim he lacked knowledge of his potential cause of action after August\r\n  1998 when he received the report of his expert.\r\nIn August 1998, Wattersâ€™s expert, Rosen, referenced the damage in\r\n  a report to Watters.Â  The fact that the expert Rosen identified the wrong\r\n  source did not further delay the commencement of the statute of limitations as\r\n  a matter of law.Â  See Dean v.\r\n    Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468\r\n  S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996) (Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations\r\n  â€œruns from the date the injured party either knows or should have known by the\r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the\r\n  wrongful conduct.â€).Â  Wattersâ€™s assertion of an estoppel theory to further\r\n  delay the start of the statute of limitations is unavailing, for the August 1998\r\n  report of Wattersâ€™s expert clearly establishes that the delay in filing the\r\n  action could not properly be attributed to any alleged misconduct by Terminix\r\n  or Furlow.Â  See Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 130, 442 S.E.2d\r\n  169, 171 (1994) (stating a defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute\r\n  of limitations as a defense if the defendantâ€™s conduct induced the delay).\r\nIII.\r\nWe affirm the grant of summary judgment, for the statute of\r\n  limitations commenced no later than August 1998 and, therefore, bars Wattersâ€™s\r\n  claims brought in December 2002.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral\r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4348","title":"McKinney v.

Aiken County of Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102,\r\n  107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Section 1-23-380(a)(5) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) establishes the substantial evidence rule as the\r\n  standard of review.Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse or\r\n  modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or\r\n  modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  â€œThe\r\n  construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration should\r\n  be accorded great deference and will not be overruled without a compelling\r\n  reason.â€Â  Vulcan Materials Co. v. Greenville\r\n    County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 342 S.C.\r\n    480, 496, 536 S.E.2d 892, 900 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcKinney argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in finding that she is not entitled to select her treating\r\n  physician after being determined permanently and totally disabled.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nMcKinney\r\n  relies upon Risinger v. Knight Textiles, 353 S.C. 69, 577 S.E.2d 222 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002) for the proposition that she should be allowed, unilaterally, to\r\n  select a provider to treat her, and that Kimberly Clark should be responsible\r\n  for payment for such treatment.Â  This reliance is misplaced.Â  In Risinger,\r\n  the appellate panel designated a treating physician for the claimant in its\r\n  order.Â  The employer and carrier refused to pay for an additional treatment as\r\n  recommended by this physician, and sought further to have the claimant evaluated\r\n  by another physician.Â  We held that the employer and carrier could not refuse\r\n  to pay for additional treatment under those circumstances.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, unlike in Risinger, there has never been a designation\r\n  of a treating physician.Â  While the appellate panel ordered Kimberly Clark to\r\n  pay for causally related medical expenses pursuant to S.C. Code. Ann. Â§\r\n  42-15-60 (1976), no particular physician was designated by the appellate panel\r\n  to treat McKinney.Â  Therefore, Risinger does not apply.\r\nMcKinney further\r\n  contends that Risinger stands for the proposition that in a case where\r\n  the claimant has received permanent and total benefits, the claimant has an\r\n  absolute right to pursue medical treatment, of any type and nature, at any\r\n  location, and that an employer and carrier are responsible for payment of that\r\n  treatment.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nMcKinneyâ€™s argument is inconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60\r\n  and Â§ 42-9-10 (1976), which establishes the rights of the employer and the\r\n  employee with regards to payment for treatments, and ultimately gives great\r\n  deference to the appellate panel.Â  This statute does not give a unilateral\r\n  right to claimants to select their treating physician, and such an unencumbered\r\n  right undermines the authority of the appellate panel, as prescribed by the\r\n  legislature.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
