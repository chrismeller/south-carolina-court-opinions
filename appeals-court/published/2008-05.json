Murphy and Jeffrey C.

Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E2d 437, 443\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when no issue exists as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  To determine whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the reviewing court must consider the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Tolbert as a Class I\r\n  Insured\r\nAppellants first contend\r\n  Tolbert was a named or Class I insured[1] under the Policy.Â  We believe the circuit court correctly determined he was not.\r\nThe â€œCommon Policy\r\n  Declarationâ€ page supplies the named insured to be used throughout the entire\r\n  Policy, and provides only BMW of North America, LLC, in the given space.Â  Below\r\n  this provision, when given the opportunity to describe the named insured, the\r\n  â€œCorporationâ€ box is checked.Â  Furthermore, on the â€œBusiness Auto Coverage\r\n  Formâ€ page, the Policy provides:Â  â€œThroughout this policy the words â€˜youâ€™ and\r\n  â€˜yourâ€™ refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations.Â  The words â€˜weâ€™,\r\n  â€˜usâ€™ and â€˜ourâ€™ refer to the Company providing this insurance.â€Â  We therefore find\r\n  Tolbert was neither a named insured nor a Class I insured of BMWâ€™s basic Policy.Â  See Concrete Servs., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 331 S.C.\r\n  506, 511, 498 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1998) (adopting the majority view that a\r\n  corporation cannot have a spouse or family members that qualify as Class I\r\n  insureds). \r\nII. Policy in Conflict\r\n  With Insurance Laws of South Carolina\r\nAppellants next\r\n  contend Zurichâ€™s exclusion of UIM coverage is in\r\n  conflict with the insurance laws of South Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants maintain UIM coverage cannot be retracted once offered and accepted, and that UIM is\r\n  personal and portable at all times.Â  To this end, Appellants rely principally\r\n  on our courtâ€™s opinion in Burgess v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company,\r\n  which was subsequently reversed.Â  361 S.C. 196, 201 S.E.2d 861 (Ct. App. 2004), revâ€™d 373 S.C. 37, 644 S.E.2d 40 (2007).Â  Burgess is a case\r\n  similar to the one before us, where an insured was injured in a motorcycle\r\n  accident while operating a motorcycle which he owned, but on which he carried\r\n  no UIM coverage.Â  The policy at issue in Burgess restricted UIM\r\n  coverage, allowing it to be excess coverage if the vehicle involved in the\r\n  accident was one owned by the insured, but limited it to the amount of UIM\r\n  coverage the insured carried on the vehicle involved.Â  The supreme court\r\n  distinguished voluntary UIM coverage, from Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage,\r\n  which is a mandatory part of all automobile insurance policies.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (2002).Â  While the Burgess court agreed with\r\n  our courtâ€™s determination that UIM coverage is personal and portable, the\r\n  supreme court expressly held â€œpublic policy is not offended by an automobile\r\n  insurance policy provision which limits the portability of basic â€˜at-homeâ€™ UIM\r\n  coverage when the insured has a vehicle involved in the accident.â€Â  Burgess,\r\n  373 S.C. at 42, 644 S.E.2d at 43.Â  \r\nThe Policy in the\r\n  case before us differs from the policy at issue in Burgess, because here,\r\n  the basic Policy completely eliminates UIM coverage from Zurich if the vehicle\r\n  involved in the accident is owned by the insured.Â  Rather, it is the two\r\n  separate endorsements discussed below which would under certain circumstances\r\n  provide UIM coverage to BMW employees leasing under the program.Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  the analysis under Burgess remains the same.Â  Tolbert was driving his\r\n  own vehicle on which he had the ability to decide whether to purchase voluntary\r\n  UIM coverage.Â  Tolbert made the decision not to obtain UIM coverage when he\r\n  insured the Honda.Â  As a result, we hold the Policyâ€™s limitation on UIM\r\n  coverage portability neither offends public policy, nor is in conflict with the insurance laws of South Carolina.\r\nIII. Coverage Under the\r\n  Endorsements\r\nFinally, Appellants\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in failing to find two separate endorsements\r\n  contained within the Policy extended UIM coverage to Tolbert.Â  \r\nA. Drive Other\r\n  Car Coverage Endorsement\r\nAppellants first\r\n  maintain the endorsement entitled â€œDrive Other Car Coverage â€“ Broadened\r\n  Coverage for Named Individualsâ€ (DOCC) extended UIM coverage under the Policy\r\n  to Tolbert.Â  As its name indicates, the DOCC endorsement provides for certain\r\n  extensions of coverage from the basic Policy; specifically, the schedule\r\n  provides that â€œ[a]ny employee furnished with a company carâ€ is entitled to a\r\n  limit of one million dollars of UIM coverage.Â  However, the Policy specifically\r\n  excludes the type of coverage Appellants seek in a qualification contained in\r\n  the following DOCC endorsement, Section C:\r\n\r\n\tChanges\r\n  in Auto Medical Payments and Uninsured and Underinsured Motorists Coverages\r\n\tThe\r\n  following is added to Who is An Insured:\r\n\tAny\r\n  individual named in the Schedule and his or her â€œfamily membersâ€ are â€œinsuredâ€\r\n  while â€œoccupyingâ€ or while a pedestrian when being struck by any â€œautoâ€ you\r\n  donâ€™t own except:\r\n\tAny\r\n  â€œautoâ€ owned by that individual or by any â€œfamily member.â€\r\n\r\nAppellants maintain this\r\n  qualification cannot restrict the endorsement extension of UIM coverage to\r\n  Tolbert without adding several operable words that are not included in a\r\n  responsible reading of Section C.Â  We disagree, and hold that Section C is\r\n  neither vague nor open to multiple interpretations, and expressly excludes\r\n  Tolbert from recovering UIM in the very situation that occurred.Â  \r\nGiven the express\r\n  instructions listed above from the Business Auto Coverage Form, the only tenable\r\n  reading of this provision is that: Â any individual named in any schedule\r\n  (Tolbert) and his or her family members are insured while occupying . . . any\r\n  auto you (BMW) donâ€™t own except:Â  any auto owned by that individual (Tolbert)\r\n  or by any family member (of Tolbert). Â Essentially Section C allows for the\r\n  portability of UM and UIM coverages to Tolbert in any accident in which he is a\r\n  passenger or a pedestrian, except accidents involving an auto owned by Tolbert\r\n  or one of his family members.Â  Because Tolbert was driving a vehicle that he\r\n  owned at the time of the accident, Section C prohibits him from recovering UIM\r\n  coverage under this endorsement.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  granting Zurichâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to this issue. \r\nB. South Carolina Underinsured Motorists Coverage Endorsement\r\nAppellants next\r\n  maintain a second endorsement, entitled â€œSouth Carolina Underinsured Motorists\r\n  Coverage,â€ (SC UIM) also extends UIM coverage under the Policy to Tolbert.Â  This\r\n  endorsement provides for the payment of UIM coverage to â€œinsured[s]â€ when\r\n  involved in an accident andÂ  Â continues to define who is an insured according\r\n  to whether the named insured is designated in the Declarations as:Â  (1) an\r\n  individual; or (2) a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, or\r\n  any other form or organization.Â  As discussed above, the named insured\r\n  designated in the â€œCommon Policy Declarationâ€ page is BMW of North America,\r\n  LLC. Â Accordingly, section (B)(2) of this endorsement applies. Â This\r\n  subsection provides:\r\n\r\n\tB. Who\r\n  Is An Insured\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIf the Named Insured is designated in the Declarations as:\r\n\t\t2.\r\n  A partnership, limited liability company, corporation or any other form of\r\n  organization, then the following are â€œinsuredsâ€:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\ta.\r\n  Anyone â€œoccupyingâ€ a covered â€œautoâ€ or a temporary substitute for a covered\r\n  â€œautoâ€.Â  The covered â€œautoâ€ must be out of service because of its breakdown,\r\n  repair, servicing, â€˜lossâ€™ or destruction.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the Honda\r\n  qualified as a temporary substitute for the covered BMW because the BMW needed\r\n  of servicing at the time of the accident.Â  In support of this claim, Appellants\r\n  tendered an affidavit to the court stating â€œ[t]he reason that [Tolbert was\r\n  driving] the [Honda] . . . was due to the fact that the BMW was in need of\r\n  service and an oil change and could not be driven.â€[2] Â \r\nZurich contends\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ Honda could not serve as a temporary substitute to the BMW because as\r\n  an owned vehicle of Appellants, there was nothing temporary in the nature of Tolbertâ€™s\r\n  use of it.Â  See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Douglas, 273 S.C.\r\n  243, 255 S.E.2d 828 (1979) (finding the use of an alleged substitute automobile\r\n  must be temporary in order for coverage under a substitution provision to be\r\n  extended).Â  However, unlike the DOCC endorsement, nothing in the SC UIM\r\n  endorsement excludes an owned vehicle from being a temporary substitute under\r\n  proper circumstances.Â  Moreover, we do not find Douglas controlling.Â \r\n  There, a husband purchased his wife a Pontiac he knew was stolen, replacing an\r\n  Oldsmobile which had UIM coverage.Â  She thereupon began driving the â€œhotâ€\r\n  automobile as her primary vehicle.Â  Subsequently, wife was killed in an\r\n  accident while driving the stolen Pontiac.Â  In an action to determine whether\r\n  the deceased was entitled to the benefit of UIM coverage from the Oldsmobile,\r\n  the supreme court held the Pontiac could not qualify as a temporary\r\n  substitute.Â  In Douglas, there was no allegation, as here, that the\r\n  Oldsmobile was out of service.Â  Instead, we find the facts of this case more\r\n  similar to those of Foremost Insurance Company v. Motorists Mutual Insurance\r\n    Company, where the Ohio court found that under a similar employerâ€™s\r\n  insurance provision, an employeeâ€™s owned motorcycle could serve as a temporary\r\n  substitute to employerâ€™s out of service automobile.Â  854 N.E.2d 552 (2006). Â \r\nWhile Appellants will\r\n  bear the ultimate burden at trial of proving the BMW was out of service due to\r\n  its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss, or destruction, at this stage of the\r\n  litigation, we find Appellantsâ€™ affidavit creates a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact in that regard, sufficient to survive Zurichâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  See Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper\r\n    Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating â€œ[s]ummary\r\n  judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the lawâ€); Hall v. Fedor, 349\r\n  S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding â€œ[e]ven when\r\n  there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or\r\n  inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be deniedâ€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  We hold the grant of summary judgment was proper as to Tolbertâ€™s\r\n  status as an insured, the Policyâ€™s adherence to the insurance laws of this\r\n  state, and the DOCC endorsement.Â  However, Appellantsâ€™ affidavit in support of\r\n  the Hondaâ€™s use as a temporary substitute for the BMW at the time of the\r\n  accident created a genuine issue of fact, sufficient to survive Zurichâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the SC UIM endorsement.Â  The decision of the\r\n  circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The two classes of insureds\r\n  are: (1) the named insured, his spouse, and relatives residing in his\r\n  household; and (2) any person using, with the consent of the named insured, the\r\n  motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in the motor vehicle.

Campâ€™s (Motherâ€™s) Federal Parent\r\n  Loan (PLUS), and $4,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We find this appeal is untimely\r\n  and, therefore, dismiss. Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother are the parents of William, who was born\r\n  September 22, 1987.Â  Father and Mother divorced in 2003.Â  Father earns $98,000\r\n  per year as a pharmacist, and Mother earns $40,000 per year as a paralegal.Â  William\r\n  earns approximately $13,000 per year.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nIn 2005, William began attending the University of South Carolina.Â  William received a Life scholarship in the amount of $5,000 per year, which is\r\n  renewable annually if he maintains a grade-point average of 3.0 or better.Â  To\r\n  pay the remaining college tuition and expenses, William received an\r\n  unsubsidized Stafford Loan in the amount of $2,625, which is renewable annually\r\n  in the amounts of $3,500 the second year and $5,500 the third and fourth years.Â \r\n  Mother and William obtained a Palmetto Assistance Loan in the amount of $5,000,\r\n  which is not renewable.Â  In addition, Mother obtained a PLUS loan in the amount\r\n  of $3,175, which is not renewable.Â  William completed his freshman year of\r\n  college with a grade point average above 3.0.Â Â Â  \r\nWilliamâ€™s yearly college expenses total $18,254, including\r\n  â€œtuition, fees, books, meal plan, meals outside of plan, housing, supplies,\r\n  incidental expenses, and other associated or related expenses such as\r\n  transportation, auto insurance, health insurance, gas and parking.â€Â  Father stated\r\n  he would have calculated Williamâ€™s expenses differently, but he accepted the\r\n  family courtâ€™s calculation of Williamâ€™s expenses.Â  In addition to these\r\n  expenses, in 2005, William used $4,000 of his earnings to purchase a\r\n  replacement used car to drive to school and work.Â Â  \r\nThe divorce decree did not address the issue of the partiesâ€™\r\n  financial responsibilities for Williamâ€™s college education.Â  William is over\r\n  the age of eighteen and therefore no longer a â€œchildâ€ under South Carolina law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-30(1) (1985). Â Although Mother and William contacted Father seeking assistance\r\n  with funding for Williamâ€™s education, Father paid only $230 and declined to\r\n  help further.Â  Mother and William filed suit seeking financial contributions\r\n  from Father toward Williamâ€™s college education, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On July\r\n  26, 2006, the family court ordered Father to pay seventy percent of â€œthe\r\n  difference between the total of [Williamâ€™s] education, including incidental\r\n  expenses, and the loans, grants and scholarshipsâ€; seventy percent of the\r\n  amount of Motherâ€™s PLUS loan; and $4,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Â Â \r\nOn August 11, 2006, Father filed a motion for reconsideration that\r\n  read, in its entirety:Â  \r\n\r\n\tPLEASE be advised that the Defendant through his undersigned\r\n  attorney, will move before the Honorable David Sawyer, Jr., to reconsider the\r\n  ruling in his Order dated July 26, 2006, in awarding [Williamâ€™s] college\r\n  expenses and costs.Â  \r\n\tThis motion hearing is set to be heard on the 18th day\r\n  of October, 2006, at 3:45 oâ€™clock, p.m.Â  \r\n\tPlease be present to defend if so minded.\r\n\r\nMother and William\r\n  filed a response memorandum to this motion on October 16, 2006.Â  Father, in\r\n  turn, faxed a memorandum in support of his motion to Mother and Williamâ€™s\r\n  counsel on October 17, 2006.Â  Father filed his memorandum on October 18, 2006,\r\n  approximately two hours before the hearing.Â  The family court heard and denied\r\n  Fatherâ€™s motion for reconsideration on October 18, 2006.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThis\r\n  appeal raises the novel question of whether a motion for reconsideration that\r\n  is insufficient under Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, stays the time for appeal.Â  We\r\n  believe it does not.Â  Consequently, Fatherâ€™s appeal is untimely.\r\nA motion\r\n  presented in writing â€œshall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and\r\n  shall set forth the relief or order sought. The requirement of writing is\r\n  fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the\r\n  motion.â€Â  Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  â€œA motion to alter or amend the judgment shall\r\n  be served not later than [ten] days after receipt of written notice of the\r\n  entry of the order.â€Â  Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Within ten days of filing a motion\r\n  under Rule 59, the movant shall provide a copy of the motion to the judge.Â \r\n  Rule 59(g), SCRCP.\r\nA\r\n  party wishing to appeal an order of the family court must serve a notice of\r\n  appeal on all respondents â€œwithin thirty (30) days after receipt of written\r\n  notice of entry of the order or judgment.â€Â  Rule 203(b)(1) and (3), SCACR.Â  A\r\n  timely Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment stays the time for appeal\r\n  until the appellant receives â€œwritten notice of entry of the order granting or\r\n  denying such motion.â€Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR; Rule 59(f), SCRCP.Â  An untimely\r\n  notice of appeal shall be dismissed.Â  Rule 203(d)(3), SCACR.Â  The clerk shall\r\n  dismiss the appeal of a party who fails to comply with the Rules, and the case\r\n  â€œshall not be reinstated except by leave of the court, upon good cause shown,\r\n  after notice to all parties.â€Â  Rule 231, SCACR.Â  Timeliness of an appeal is a\r\n  jurisdictional matter.Â  Elam v.

Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C.\r\n  9, 17, 602 S.E.2d 772, 776 (2004).Â  An appellantâ€™s failure to comply with the\r\n  procedural rules for appeal deprives the court of appellate jurisdiction but\r\n  not of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 387,\r\n  596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  question whether a motion to reconsider, alter, or amend judgment under Rule\r\n  59(e) that is insufficient under Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, stays the time for appeal\r\n  is novel in South Carolina.Â  However, the federal courts may guide us on this\r\n  issue.[2]Â \r\n  Rule 7(b)(1) is substantially similar to its federal counterpart, Rule 7(b)(1),\r\n  FRCP.Â  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, is identical to its federal counterpart, Rule 59(e),\r\n  FRCP.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed this precise\r\n  question as it relates to appeals under the Federal Rules in Martinez v.\r\n    Trainor, 556 F.2d 818 (7th Cir. 1977).Â  There, the defendant filed a timely\r\n  motion under Rule 59(e), FRCP.Â  Id. at 819.Â  The motion requested the\r\n  district court to â€œâ€˜alter, amend, or vacateâ€™â€ its prior judgment.Â  One week\r\n  later, the defendant moved for leave to file a memorandum supporting the\r\n  motion.Â  Plaintiff objected.Â  The district court accepted defendantâ€™s\r\n  memorandum nonetheless and subsequently denied defendantâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion.Â  When\r\n  defendant later appealed the ruling, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal\r\n  as untimely.Â  Id.Â  The appellate court found the abbreviated motion\r\n  complied with Rule 7(b)(1), FRCP, by adequately identifying the â€œrelief or\r\n  order sought.â€Â  However, it failed to satisfy the additional requirement of\r\n  stating â€œwith particularity the grounds therefor.â€Â  Id. at 820; Rule\r\n  7(b)(1), FRCP.Â  According to the appellate court, the language at issue â€œfailed\r\n  to state even one ground for granting the motion.â€Â  556 F.2d at 819.Â  The\r\n  defendant argued in the alternative the memorandum he filed a week after the\r\n  motion amended the motion itself.Â  The appellate court declined to permit what\r\n  would, in effect, be an extension of time under Rule 6(b), FRCP,[3] stating â€œif a party could file a skeleton motion and later fill it in, the\r\n  purpose of the time limitation would be defeated.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  instant case, in its essentials, is analogous to Martinez.Â  Following\r\n  the family courtâ€™s adverse ruling, Father filed a motion under Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP. Â Though timely, Fatherâ€™s motion failed to comply with Rule 7(b)(1),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Whereas the motion in Martinez failed only the particularity\r\n  requirement of the federal rule, Fatherâ€™s motion satisfied neither the\r\n  particularity nor the relief-sought requirement of the South Carolina rule.Â  Father\r\n  neither identified an error of law by the family court nor stated a single\r\n  ground on which the family court might grant him relief, thus failing the\r\n  particularity requirement.Â  Furthermore, in requesting only that the family\r\n  court â€œreconsider [its] ruling,â€ Father failed to identify the relief he sought\r\n  through his motion.Â  Mother and William objected to the insufficiency of\r\n  Fatherâ€™s motion in their response memorandum, and, as in Martinez, Father\r\n  later filed a memorandum purporting to elaborate on his motion.[4] Â Like the Martinez trial court, the family court accepted the\r\n  late memorandum and eventually denied the motion, and the movant appealed.Â Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  ruling that an insufficient motion under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, does not stay the\r\n  time for appeal comports with federal law on point as well as with prior South Carolina decisions on a closely related issue.Â  In Elam, our supreme court\r\n  traced the history of judicial treatment of successive Rule 59(e) motions.Â  361\r\n  S.C. at 15, 602 S.E.2d at 775.Â  Elam confirmed successive post-trial\r\n  motions that raise no new issues do not stay the time for appeal and noted this\r\n  ruling reflected the â€œprevailing view among federal courts.â€Â  Id. at 18,\r\n  602 S.E.2d at 777.Â  The purposes of insufficient and successive post-trial\r\n  motions appear to be the same:Â  both attempt to buy time without asserting a\r\n  meritorious claim.Â  These tactics further neither justice nor efficiency, and\r\n  we cannot facilitate their use.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  rules clearly state the requirements for motions and for appeals.Â  Permitting a\r\n  post-trial motion that identifies neither the grounds on which it relies nor\r\n  the relief sought to stay the time for appeal under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, would\r\n  undermine our procedural rules.Â  Moreover, it would encourage parties to file\r\n  baseless post-trial motions with the expectation of â€œfilling in the blanksâ€ at\r\n  a later date.Â  Consequently, we find Fatherâ€™s appeal is untimely, and we\r\n  dismiss.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find Fatherâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration was insufficient and failed\r\n  to stay the time for appeal.Â  Consequently, Fatherâ€™s appeal was untimely, and\r\n  we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.Â  Accordingly, Fatherâ€™s appeal\r\n  is \r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Williamâ€™s 2005 W-2 statement indicates his gross\r\n  earnings were $5,746 for that year.Â  However, William testified he works forty\r\n  hours per week during the summer and approximately thirty hours per week during\r\n  the school year at a rate of $8.50 per hour.Â  Assuming twelve weeks of\r\n  full-time summer work and thirty-six weeks of part-time school-year work, Williamâ€™s\r\n  gross income is approximately $13,260 per year.Â  \r\n[2] Both federal courts and other state courts have\r\n  contemplated this issue and other related issues.Â  See Allender v.\r\n    Raytheon Aircraft Co., 439 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir. 2006) (insufficient\r\n  post-trial motion under Rule 59(e), FRCP, did not toll time to appeal in spite\r\n  of circuit courtâ€™s improper extension of time to file supporting memorandum); People\r\n    v. Collins, 127 Ill.App.3d 236, 240, 468 N.E.2d 1343, 1346 (1984)\r\n  (insufficiently specific post-trial motion did not preserve issues for review); N.C. Alliance for Transp. Reform v. N.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 645 S.E.2d\r\n  105, 108-09 (N.C. App. 2007) (appeal of final order was untimely where\r\n  insufficient post-trial motion under Rule 59(e), N.C.G.S. Â§&nbsp;1A-1, did not\r\n  toll time to appeal, and only issues ruled upon in the post-trial motion were\r\n  preserved).\r\n[3] Rule 6(b), FRCP, is also substantially the same as\r\n  Rule 6(b), SCRCP.Â  \r\n[4] One notable difference between Martinez and\r\n  this case is the timing of the objections to the Rule 59(e) motions and\r\n  memoranda.Â  In Martinez, the defendant moved for leave to file his\r\n  memorandum at the hearing on his motion, which occurred before his initial\r\n  appeal period expired.Â  Id. at 819.Â  Plaintiff also objected during that\r\n  period, thereby placing defendant on notice that his motion was insufficient.Â  Id.Â  Here, Fatherâ€™s hearing date was set well beyond the initial appeal period.Â  As\r\n  a result, Mother and Williamâ€™s objection, and Fatherâ€™s subsequent memorandum\r\n  supporting his motion, were all filed after the initial appeal period had\r\n  expired.Â  However, we do not believe this difference renders Martinez distinguishable.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4384","title":"Murrells Inlet Corporation v.

Hanna, of Myrtle Beach, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Â Â Iva Mae Ward\r\n  (Ward) appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order finding Ward created a fifty foot\r\n  easement by recording a plat depicting the easement and requiring Ward to: (1)\r\n  refrain from interference with the easement and (2) remove all encroachments\r\n  from the easement.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant Ward and other heirs inherited\r\n  a 6.86 acre tract near Stevens Cross Road in Little River, South Carolina.Â  In\r\n  1987, Ward became the sole owner of the entire tract.Â  In 1990, Ward divided the\r\n  land into five lots for the purpose of transferring portions of the property to\r\n  her children.Â  \r\nWhen Ward subdivided the property, she\r\n  granted a fifty foot right-of-way to the lots to allow access from Highway 57, as\r\n  evidenced in a plat prepared for Ward by C.B. Berry R.L.S. and recorded in the\r\n  Horry County Register of Deeds.Â  In the pleadings, Ward admitted she provided\r\n  the fifty foot easement pursuant to the Horry County Zoning and Planning\r\n  Regulations.Â  However, Ward now claims the surveyor included the road on the\r\n  plat under the erroneous belief that the regulations required the easement for\r\n  the creation of a subdivision.Â  Additionally, Ward avers she was unaware the\r\n  plat included a fifty foot roadway and only intended for the existing driveway\r\n  to remain as a shared private drive.Â  \r\nWard owns a house located on Lot A. Â She has resided and continues to reside at this address since the subdivision of\r\n  the property.Â  Lot A is the closest lot to the access point for the subdivision\r\n  off of Highway 57.Â  \r\nAfter subdividing the property, Ward conveyed\r\n  Lot 4 to her son Michael, who constructed a house on the property.Â  Lot 4 is located behind the other lots and is the farthest from Highway 57.Â  Access to Lot 4 is provided by a right-of-way running across one side of Wardâ€™s property.Â  Michael\r\n  used this right-of-way for access to his portion of the tract.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 2003, Michael defaulted on a mortgage\r\n  on the property and went into foreclosure.Â  In 2005, Respondent Murrells Inlet\r\n  Corporation (MIC) purchased Lot 4, including the house and any improvements\r\n  thereon and the accompanying right-of-way.Â  MIC then began using Lot 4 as rental property and presently has tenants residing in the home.Â  \r\nMIC purchased the property with the\r\n  understanding that there was a fifty foot right-of-way providing access to the\r\n  lot.Â  The right-of-way is an unpaved dirt road that runs from Highway 57\r\n  through the edge of Wardâ€™s property, passing alongside each of the lots in the\r\n  tract, and ending at Lot 4.Â  It consists of two dirt ruts which allow only a\r\n  single vehicle at a time to access the lots.Â  Â Â \r\nThe right-of-way is currently in poor\r\n  condition. Â Several encroachments in the right-of-way add to the difficulties\r\n  inherent in traveling the road in its current state and prevent any\r\n  improvements to the road from being completed.Â  Because of the roadâ€™s present condition\r\n  and the encroachments, the tenants residing at Lot 4 have a hard time getting\r\n  to and from their home and have expressed concerns that it may be impossible\r\n  for an emergency vehicle to reach Lot 4.Â  MIC has repeatedly objected to Ward\r\n  about the obstruction of the right-of-way to no avail.Â  \r\nMIC filed a Petition for an Order to\r\n  Remove Encroachments and a Rule to Show Cause against Ward and a hearing was\r\n  held.Â  In issuing the order, the master concluded that Ward granted and\r\n  dedicated an easement to Lot 4 when the tract was subdivided and Ward was not\r\n  allowed to interfere with the use of the granted easement.Â  \r\nIn the Order to Remove Encroachments,\r\n  the master noted that Ward and her family placed the following encroachments in\r\n  the right-of-way:Â  an old truck filled with trash and debris, a rusty water\r\n  heater, wooden poles, a wooden storage shed, a garden, various scrap metal,\r\n  mattress springs, lawnmowers, and some other miscellaneous trash and debris.Â  The\r\n  master found that Wardâ€™s misuse of the easement deprives MIC of the concurrent\r\n  use of the easement for the purposes of ingress and egress to Lot 4.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe master ordered:Â  \r\n\t[Ward] shall not block the easement or\r\n  use the easement for any purpose other than as a private driveway.Â  [Ward]\r\n  shall, within fourteen days, remove those items that are within the fifty-foot\r\n  right of way which encroaches upon the easement.Â  If [Ward] does not remove\r\n  those items within the time allowed, [MIC] may remove said items and [Ward]\r\n  shall pay the cost of the removal.Â  [Ward] shall also pay [MIC] the costs of\r\n  this action and must pay the pro-rata share of any further improvements to the\r\n  road.Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing the decision of the master,\r\n  Ward filed a Motion for Reconsideration.Â  The motion was denied.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDoes\r\n  a plat recorded when property is subdivided confer an easement to the subsequent\r\n  grantees of the property to the extent the easement is delineated in the plat?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law\r\n  action and is subject to the any evidence standard of review when tried by a\r\n  judge without a jury.Â  Slear v.

Smiley, 301 S.C. 10, 15, 389 S.E.2d 857, 861\r\n  (1990) (Toal, J., dissenting)).Â  \r\nRecently,\r\n  in an excellent academic writing, our Supreme Court explicated the law of\r\n  implied easements in Inlet Harbour v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Parks,\r\n    Recreation and Tourism, Op. No. 26459 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 17, 2008)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 11 at 15, 20-21):\r\n\r\n\tThe creation of an implied\r\n  easement generally requires that the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\n  conveyance, the property, the parties, or some other characteristic demonstrate\r\n  that the objective intention of the parties was to create an easement. Â 25 Am. Jur. 2d\r\n\tEasements and Licenses Â§ 19 (2004); 28A C.J.S. Â§ 62.Â  Courts\r\n  have, over time, developed various presumptions regarding the creation of\r\n  implied easements in certain circumstances.Â  One such presumption arises when\r\n  an owner subdivides his land and has the land platted into lots and streets.Â \r\n  This Court has recognized the general rule that when an owner conveys\r\n  subdivided lots and references the plat in the deed, the owner grants the lot\r\n  owners an easement over the streets appearing in the plat.Â  See, eg.,\r\n\tBlue\r\n    Ridge Realty Co., 247 S.C. at 118, 145 S.E.2d at 924-925.Â  \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tAs a starting point, we note\r\n  that the intentions of the parties to the transaction are the overriding focus\r\n  when examining implied easements.Â  McAllister v. Smiley, 301 S.C. 10,\r\n  16, 389 S.E.2d 857, 862 (1990) (Toal, J. dissenting); 28A C.J.S. Â§Â§ 82, 149;\r\n  17A Am. Jur. Â§Â§ 40, 116; 25 Am. Jur. 2d. Â§ 19.Â  Thus, the Department over-reads\r\n\tBlue Ridge considerably in suggesting that the case stands for the\r\n  proposition that an easement created by reference to a plat is presumptively an\r\n  easement of a particular scope.Â  The rule applied in Blue Ridge is\r\n  nothing more than a presumption that when a grantor conveys property with\r\n  reference to a plat showing streets or other ways of passage, the grantor\r\n  intends to allow the grantee the use of the delineated streets and ways of\r\n  passage.Â  McAllister, 301 S.C. at 11-12, 389 S.E.2d at 858.Â  The case \r\n\tCason\r\n    v. Gibson, 217 S.C. 500, 61 S.E.2d 58 (1950), explained the policy underlying\r\n  this presumption in terms of estoppel.Â  In that case, this Court explained that\r\n  when a grantor conveys land abutting a street, he is estopped from denying the\r\n  streetâ€™s existence and the right of the grantee to its use.Â  Id. at 507,\r\n  61 S.E.2d at 61.Â  This approach is reasonable, and it is also reasonable that\r\n  when an owner conveys property that has been subdivided for residential\r\n  purposes, the grantor presumably intends for grantees to have access to the\r\n  abutting subdivision streets for normal residential purposes.Â  But the property\r\n  at issue here is not subdivided residential property and abuts no road.Â  This\r\n  demonstrates the problems that might occur if we were to apply a rigid\r\n  presumption based solely upon particular geography or land division.Â  Our guidepost\r\n  must be what the parties intended, and the best evidence of the partiesâ€™\r\n  intentions are the facts and circumstances surrounding the conveyance.Â  Â \r\n\r\nThe existence of an easement is NOT an issue in this case.Â  Only, the extent and scope of the easement is\r\n  contested.Â  Because we are proceeding in equity, we may find facts in\r\n  accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nThe evidentiary record is imbued with\r\n  intransigence and arrogance on the part of Ward.Â  Her belated activity in emasculating\r\n  the easement by placing encroachments in the right-of-way is both unappealing\r\n  and unavailing.Â  The factual finding by the master in regards to Wardâ€™s misuse\r\n  of the easement is supported by the testimony.Â Â  To allow Wardâ€™s intent to\r\n  override the original grant of a fifty foot easement would result in a travesty\r\n  of justice.Â  Her demonstrated intent to eliminate a reasonable easement belies\r\n  common sense.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, when Ward\r\n  subdivided the property and recorded a plat referencing a fifty foot\r\n  right-of-way, it may be inferred that she intended the right-of-way to be a\r\n  private easement dedicated to the use of the lot owners, their successors in\r\n  title, and the public.Â  The deed and the recorded plat in this case are\r\n  controlling notwithstanding an â€œintentâ€ analysis.Â  By recording the easement on\r\n  the plat, Ward evidenced an intention to grant that easement to any future lot\r\n  owners in the subdivision.Â  When Ward originally conveyed Lot 4 with reference\r\n  to the recorded plat, her grantees and any subsequent purchasers acquired the\r\n  right to use this easement to the full extent that it is indicated in the plat.Â \r\n  MIC relied upon the recorded plat when it purchased Lot 4.Â  The dedication of\r\n  the private easement was complete when Ward originally conveyed the lot.Â  It\r\n  would now be unfair to deny MIC the right to the full use and enjoyment of the\r\n  easement as indicated in the plat, regardless of what Ward now argues were her\r\n  intentions at the time the plat was recorded.Â  Subsequent purchasers are\r\n  entitled to rely on recorded deeds and plats to determine their rights in\r\n  respect to property.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nJuxtaposing the Blue Ridge rule,\r\n  the holding in Inlet Harbour, and the partiesâ€™ intentions, we come to\r\n  the ineluctable conclusion that MIC is entitled to use of the fifty foot\r\n  easement in order to access Lot 4 and this right-of-way should not be\r\n  encroached upon or obstructed.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4385","title":"Collins v.

Wukela, of Florence, for Appellants.\r\n        Michael Mills Nunn, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.: This\r\n  case arises out of a motor vehicle accident where the vehicle driven by Mark\r\n  Frasier crossed the centerline and struck Calvin Collinsâ€™s vehicle.Â  Calvin and\r\n  his wife, Faye, sued Frasier for the resulting injuries and loss of\r\n  consortium.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Frasier after finding he suffered\r\n  a sudden, unforeseeable incapacity to operate his vehicle.Â  The Collinses\r\n  appeal the trial courtâ€™s denial of motions for a directed verdict, judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, new trial, or to alter or amend the verdict.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\n In Boyleston v.\r\n  Baxley, 243 S.C. 281, 284-85, 133 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1963), the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court held a vehicle operator is not ordinarily chargeable with\r\n  negligence when he suddenly losses consciousness due to an unforeseen cause.[2]Â \r\n  The court in Boyleston assigned the burden of proving such incapacity to\r\n  the defendant.Â  243 S.C. at 285, 133 S.E.2d 797. Â The appeal before us today\r\n  turns on whether Frasier presented sufficient evidence to create a jury\r\n  question as to whether he suffered a sudden, unforeseeable incapacity to\r\n  operate a vehicle.Â  We hold Frasier presented evidence which removed his\r\n  sudden, unforeseeable incapacity defense from the realm of conjecture into the\r\n  field of permissible inference.Â  As a result, the trial court properly\r\n  presented the defense to the jury and committed no error in refusing to set the\r\n  verdict aside.\r\nWe find the\r\n  Collinsesâ€™ reliance on Howle v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 288 S.C. 586, 344\r\n  S.E.2d 157 (Ct. App. 1986) unavailing.Â  In Howle, the jury rejected the\r\n  defendant driverâ€™s defense of sudden, unforeseeable incapacity and found for\r\n  the plaintiff.Â  Id. at 588, 344 S.E.2d at 158. Â The trial court denied a\r\n  motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict by the defendant driver.Â  Id. at 589, 344 S.E.2d at 158. Â This Court affirmed the trial court after reviewing the evidence and all inferences reasonably\r\n  deducible in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, which is the applicable\r\n  standard of review.Â  Id.Â  The driver in Howle suffered\r\n  from diabetes for over thirty years, missed a meal, and appeared to be ill when\r\n  dealing with a customer prior to the accident.Â  Id. at 589-90, 344\r\n  S.E.2d at 158-59.Â  Because a question of fact was presented, the trial court\r\n  correctly presented the defense of sudden, unforeseeable incapacity to the\r\n  jury.Â  The point is that in Howle, as in the case before us, a jury\r\n  question was presented.Â  There will always be examples where claims and\r\n  defenses prevail in one factual setting but not in another.Â  Juries resolve\r\n  questions of fact, just as the jury did in Howle and the jury did in the\r\n  case before us.\r\nIn this case, the\r\n  jury specifically found Frasier experienced â€œa sudden unforeseeable incapacity\r\n  to operate his vehicle.â€Â  The only question we must answer is whether there is\r\n  any evidence to support this finding.Â  We find the record contains ample\r\n  support for this finding.Â  Frasier testified he felt fine while driving until\r\n  suddenly he felt all of his energy drain and saw fuzz.Â  Frasierâ€™s family\r\n  doctor, Dr. Robert Richey, was qualified as an expert in internal medicine.Â \r\n  Dr. Richey testified to his knowledge Frasier had not exhibited signs of\r\n  fainting prior to the accident.Â  Following the accident, Dr. Richey\r\n  administered a glucose tolerance test.Â  The test indicated Frasier suffered\r\n  from hypoglycemia.Â  Dr. Richey explained a hypoglycemic event can result in\r\n  loss of consciousness and the medicine Frasier was taking at the time of the\r\n  accident could mask hypoglycemia.\r\n We agree with the\r\n  Collinses that a defendantâ€™s own, self-serving testimony is insufficient by\r\n  itself to create a question of fact as to\r\n  the defense.Â  However, this is simply not the case here.Â  Frasier did not\r\n  merely testify he blacked out.Â  In\r\n  addition to Frasierâ€™s testimony regarding the event, the record includes Dr.\r\n  Richeyâ€™s testimony about a likely cause of the incapacity, Frasierâ€™s lack of\r\n  history with this illness, and the potential masking of the symptoms by\r\n  Frasierâ€™s other medications.Â  Further, the Collinses find fault with the juryâ€™s\r\n  assessment of the weight and credibility of the evidence in light of the\r\n  conflicting testimony.Â  The issue of credibility is for the jury alone.Â  Parsons\r\n    v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 67, 456\r\n  S.E.2d 366, 368 (1995) (stating the credibility and weight of testimony\r\n  is for the trier of fact).\r\nIn sum, Frasier\r\n  provided sufficient proof of sudden, unforeseeable incapacity to create an\r\n  issue of fact for the jury.Â  Therefore, no error occurred when the trial court\r\n  denied the Collinsesâ€™ motions for directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding\r\n  the verdict, new trial, and motion to alter or amend.Â  The judgment of the\r\n  trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The supreme court specifically recognized â€œthe\r\n  principle that â€˜the operator of an automobile is not ordinarily chargeable with\r\n  negligence because he is suddenly stricken by a fainting spell, or loses\r\n  consciousness from some other unforeseen cause, and is unable to control the\r\n  vehicle.â€™â€ Â Boyleston, 243 S.C. at 284-85, 133 S.E.2d at 797 (quoting 5A\r\n  Am.

Anderson appeals his conviction for\r\n  first-degree burglary and sentence of twenty years in prison.Â  Anderson argues the trial court erred in admitting an unauthenticated rolled ten-print card as maintained in the automated fingerprint\r\n  identification system (AFIS) into evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn August 15, 2003, Pricilla Ward\r\n  discovered someone had broken into the home she shared with her husband.Â  The\r\n  intruder had gained access to the home by breaking a bedroom window.Â  The Wards\r\n  discovered several items missing from the home, including jewelry and firearms.Â \r\n  Officer Hardee of the Horry County Police Department responded to the break-in\r\n  and lifted two fingerprints from the broken window.Â  Hardee identified Stateâ€™s\r\n  Exhibit One and Two as the lift cards of fingerprints taken off the window in\r\n  the bedroom.Â  \r\nThe State called Sergeant Gause as an expert in the field of\r\n  fingerprint analysis.Â  Gause testified he analyzed Stateâ€™s Exhibit One and Two,\r\n  checking them through AFIS.Â  He explained how the AFIS machine takes a picture\r\n  from a latent print which is then downloaded into the computer and sent through\r\n  AFIS, which searches the database.Â  Gause testified AFIS produces twenty to\r\n  thirty possible matches, and the operator then has to physically review each\r\n  potential matching print and compare it with the latent print from the crime\r\n  scene.Â  Gause identified Stateâ€™s Exhibit Three as the enlarged photograph of\r\n  Stateâ€™s Exhibit One, one of the prints taken from the scene.Â  Stateâ€™s Exhibit\r\n  Four was identified by Gause as â€œthe known printâ€ from the database that was found\r\n  to be a match to the latent print.Â  Stateâ€™s Exhibit Four included an\r\n  identification number of â€œSC00454508â€ in the bottom left-hand corner, which\r\n  identified the individual to whom it belonged.Â  When they obtain the\r\n  identification number of a matching print from AFIS, they then identify the\r\n  person to whom that individual number is assigned.Â  Gause identified Stateâ€™s\r\n  Exhibit Seven as a â€œknown rolled ten-print.â€Â  He explained that once a person\r\n  is arrested, law enforcement rolls the prints on cards and the cards are\r\n  retained on file in a database through SLED and the FBI.Â  Gause then identified\r\n  Stateâ€™s Exhibit Seven as Andersonâ€™s ten-print card.Â  \r\nAt this point, Anderson objected to testimony regarding Stateâ€™s\r\n  Exhibit Seven, the rolled ten-print card, arguing the rolled prints from the\r\n  database had not been properly authenticated pursuant to State v. Rich,\r\n  293 S.C. 172, 359 S.E.2d 281 (1987).Â  The court ruled the ten-print card\r\n  required authentication.Â  The State indicated it would present evidence of a\r\n  witness from SLED regarding AFIS.Â  Noting the ten-print card in question\r\n  originated from Kirkland Correctional Facility, the State proposed, and counsel\r\n  for Anderson agreed, the witness would identify it as coming from a South\r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Agency, apparently to avoid injecting information that\r\n  it was taken at a correctional facility.Â  However, Anderson maintained the\r\n  State was required to present testimony regarding the individual who actually\r\n  took the print, and that information that it was taken by law enforcement would\r\n  be insufficient for authentication.Â  The court disagreed, ruling the State was\r\n  not required â€œto have the officer who actually took [the print].â€Â  \r\nThe State then presented the testimony of Lieutenant Joseph Means\r\n  from SLED, who is in charge of the crime\r\n  information center at SLED and oversees the AFIS system there.Â  Lieutenant Means described SLEDâ€™s\r\n  procedures regarding ten-print cards and AFIS.Â  He testified AFIS stores all the digital fingerprint images of every\r\n  ten-print card in South Carolina.Â  Means explained Stateâ€™s Exhibit Seven was a\r\n  normal ten-print card, printed from the AFIS system work station.Â  Printed on\r\n  the card is a state identification number, which Means explained is a unique\r\n  number assigned to each individual when first arrested that stays unique to the\r\n  individual no matter how many times that person is arrested.Â  A record is kept\r\n  of which identification number belongs to which individual.Â  Means testified Stateâ€™s Exhibit Seven bore\r\n  identification number â€œSouth Carolina 00454508,â€ which belonged to Anderson.Â  He then stated this ten-print fingerprint\r\n  card of Anderson was taken on April 7, 2004 by a law enforcement agency.Â  He\r\n  further testified these prints were sent to him and entered into the AFIS by\r\n  his staff.Â  Means testified he was the custodian of the cards, and that once a\r\n  fingerprint card is sent into SLED, his office maintains the card in the exact\r\n  manner in which it arrives.Â  The\r\n  trial court admitted the rolled ten-print card into evidence over Andersonâ€™s objection.Â  Thereafter, Anderson was convicted of first-degree burglary and\r\n  sentenced to twenty years in prison.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and\r\n  the courtâ€™s decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Â State\r\n    v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the decision of the trial court is based upon an error\r\n  of law or upon factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id. Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAnderson contends the trial court erred in admitting the\r\n  rolled ten-print card as maintained in AFIS into evidence because the card was\r\n  not properly authenticated.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nProperly\r\n  authenticated fingerprints are admissible against a criminal defendant. Â State\r\n    v. Rich, 293 S.C. 172, 173, 359 S.E.2d 281, 281 (1987). Â Further, under the\r\n  business records exception or the public records exception, admission of police\r\n  fingerprint records is generally considered not to violate the prohibition\r\n  against hearsay.Â  Id. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-5-510 (1985)\r\n  (Providing in regard to business records as evidence, â€œ[a] record of an act,\r\n  condition or event shall, insofar as relevant, be competent evidence if the\r\n  custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of\r\n  its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business, at or\r\n  near the time of the act, condition or event and if, in the opinion of the\r\n  court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as\r\n  to justify its admission.â€); Rule 803(8),\r\n  SCRE (Providing in regard to public\r\n  records and reports, â€œ[r]ecords, reports,\r\n  statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies,\r\n  setting forth (A) the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters\r\n  observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty\r\n  to report. . .â€ are not excluded by the hearsay rule.). Â Â However, the party offering fingerprints into\r\n  evidence must comply with the usual requirements of authentication. Â Rich,\r\n  293 S.C. at 173, 359 S.E.2d at 281.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Rich, our\r\n  supreme court cited with approval a North Carolina case, State v. Foster,\r\n  284 N.C. 259, 200 S.E.2d 782 (1973), in determining whether a fingerprint\r\n  comparison had been properly authenticated.Â  293 S.C. at 173, 359 S.E.2d at 282.Â \r\n  The court noted in Foster, a police officer testified he identified a\r\n  latent fingerprint with one alleged to be the defendantâ€™s which was on a\r\n  fingerprint card in the master file of the police department. Â Id.Â  There, the prosecution neither attempted to lay a foundation that the\r\n  fingerprints on the master file card were in fact those of the defendant, nor\r\n  sought to introduce the master file card. Â Id.Â  In conclusion, the North\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court held: Â â€œ[W]ithout evidence as to when and by whom the card was made and that the prints on the card were in fact those of this\r\n  defendant,â€ testimony concerning the fingerprint card from the master file â€œviolated\r\n  the hearsay rule and should have been excluded.â€ Â Id. Â at 174, 359\r\n  S.E.2d 282 (emphasis added); Foster, 284 N.C. at 273, 200 S.E.2d at 793\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nGuided\r\n  by the Foster holding, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed Richâ€™s\r\n  conviction and held a witness should not have been allowed to testify regarding\r\n  fingerprint data contained in an unauthenticated document.Â  Rich, 293\r\n  S.C. at 174, 359 S.E.2d at 282.Â  The court found the latent prints which the\r\n  law enforcement agent had taken himself were properly admitted.Â  Id. at 173, 359 S.E.2d at 281.Â  However, testimony regarding the inked impressions\r\n  used to compare to the latent prints was improper since the inked impressions\r\n  were not properly authenticated.Â  Id. Â at 174, 359 S.E.2d at 282.Â  As in Foster, the State in Rich â€œneither attempted to lay a foundation\r\n  that the fingerprints on the master file card were in fact those of the\r\n  defendant, nor sought to introduce the master file card.â€Â  Id. Â at 173,\r\n  359 S.E.2d at 282.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Anderson contends a proper interpretation of Rich requires the State to present the actual person who took the fingerprint to\r\n  testify in order to authenticate the fingerprints from the master card as\r\n  evidence.Â  We do not believe Rich stands for such a strict authentication\r\n  requirement.Â  Instead, we find the evidence presented by the State, showing\r\n  when and where the fingerprints were taken and how they were submitted to SLED,\r\n  and describing the process implemented by law enforcement for taking the\r\n  fingerprints and maintaining an accurate record of them in AFIS, was sufficient\r\n  to authenticate the fingerprints as Andersonâ€™s known prints.Â  See Rule\r\n  901(a) and (b)(9), SCRE (â€œThe requirement of authentication or identification\r\n  as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient\r\n  to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.â€\r\n  Â â€œ[T]he following [is an example] of authentication or identification\r\n  conforming with the requirements of this rule:Â  Evidence describing a process\r\n  or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system\r\n  produces an accurate result.â€)Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly\r\n  admitted testimony concerning the ten-print card.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4387","title":"Blanding v.

[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe present case arises out of a dispute regarding the partiesâ€™\r\n  rights with respect to casualty insurance proceeds paid for foreclosed property\r\n  owned by Sandra Blanding.Â  In February 2003, Blanding executed and delivered a\r\n  mortgage for $40,000 to Money First Financial Services, Inc., for the purchase\r\n  of a manufactured home.Â  The mortgage was secured by real property located in Berkley County, South Carolina, to which the manufactured home was permanently attached.Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, the mortgage was assigned to Long Beach Mortgage Company, a\r\n  wholly owned subsidiary of Washington Mutual, Inc.Â  Approximately one year\r\n  later, in January 2004, the mortgage was assigned to Deutsche Bank National\r\n  Trust Company, as trustee for Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2003-4.[2]Â  \r\nAs the borrower, Blanding was required to maintain insurance on\r\n  her property which named Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss\r\n  payee.Â  Specifically, the mortgage requires as follows:\r\n\r\n  Property Insurance.Â  Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter\r\n    erected on the Property insured against loss by fire . . . . All insurance\r\n    policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies . . . shall name\r\n    Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  mortgage provides: â€œ[i]f Â Borrower fails to maintain any of the\r\n  coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lenderâ€™s\r\n  option and Borrowerâ€™s expense.â€Â  The mortgage further states that in the event\r\n  of loss: \r\n\r\n  Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any\r\n    insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance proceeds were\r\n    required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property,\r\n    if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lenderâ€™s security is\r\n    not lessened . . . . If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible\r\n    or Lenderâ€™s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied\r\n    to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with\r\n    the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.Â  \r\n\r\nFinally, the\r\n  mortgage provides that attorneysâ€™ fees incurred in â€œa legal proceeding that\r\n  might significantly affect Lenderâ€™s interest in the property and/or rights\r\n  under this Security Instrumentâ€ shall become the additional debt of Blanding as\r\n  the borrower.Â  \r\nIn August 2004, Blanding purchased a home insurance policy from\r\n  Foremost Insurance Company (Foremost).Â  The policy issued by Foremost provided\r\n  for $63,000 worth of coverage on Blandingâ€™s residence and named Washington\r\n  Mutual as the lienholder.Â  In addition, the policy included an â€œother insuranceâ€\r\n  clause providing â€œ[i]f both this and other insurance apply to a loss,\r\n  [Foremost] will pay our share.Â  Our share will be the proportionate amount that\r\n  this insurance bears to the total amount of all applicable insurance.â€Â  In\r\n  November 2004 Lender, apparently under the misapprehension that Blanding had\r\n  not obtained coverage on the property as required, obtained an insurance policy\r\n  from American Security Insurance Company (American Security) providing $48,000\r\n  worth of coverage on Blandingâ€™s property.Â  The American Security policy also\r\n  included an â€œother insuranceâ€ clause which states â€œ[i]f there is any other\r\n  valid or collectible insurance which would attach if the insurance under this\r\n  policy had not been effected, this insurance shall apply only as excess and in\r\n  no event as contributing insurance and then only after all other insurance has\r\n  been exhausted.â€Â  \r\nOn December 7, 2004, the Master-in-Equity issued an order finding\r\n  Blanding failed to make payments due as provided on the note.Â  He ordered\r\n  Blandingâ€™s mortgage be foreclosed and the property sold at public auction.Â  At\r\n  the time of foreclosure, the total debt due on the mortgage, including\r\n  interest, escrow adjustments, late charges, costs, and attorneysâ€™ fees, was\r\n  $51,995.14.Â  On January 1, 2005, prior to the foreclosure sale, Blandingâ€™s\r\n  residence was destroyed by fire.Â  On January 5, 2005, the property was sold at\r\n  public auction to Lender for $2,500.Â  \r\nOn January 31, 2005, American Security issued a check to\r\n  Washington Mutual Bank in the amount of $22,403.91 for losses arising out of\r\n  the fire.Â  Thereafter, on May 27, 2005, Foremost issued a check in the amount\r\n  of $62,750[3] made payable to Blanding and her attorneys, as well as Washington Mutual and\r\n  Deutsche Bank. Â When Lender discovered proceeds were issued under the Foremost\r\n  policy, Lender returned the $22,403.91 to American Security based on its\r\n  determination it was required to do so under the terms of the policy. Â The\r\n  parties disagreed as to their rights to the Foremost proceeds, with Lender\r\n  asserting these proceeds were to be applied first to the full amount of\r\n  Blandingâ€™s debt due on the mortgage.Â  \r\nBlanding filed this declaratory judgment action on November 10,\r\n  2005 asserting Lender failed and refused to apply the other insurance proceeds\r\n  paid in connection with the loss, and claiming she was entitled to an\r\n  accounting of her debt and application of â€œany and all insurance proceeds paid\r\n  or payable to or received by [Lender].â€Â  Lender answered and counterclaimed,\r\n  asserting the American Security policy applied only â€œas excess and in no event\r\n  as contributing,â€ and it was therefore entitled to receive from Blanding the\r\n  amount of the debt at the time of foreclosure, less the $2,500 received in the\r\n  foreclosure sale, together with prejudgment interest and attorneysâ€™ fees.Â \r\n  Blanding replied to Lenderâ€™s counterclaim, maintaining she was entitled to a\r\n  set-off or credit for insurance proceeds received by Lender, including those\r\n  retuned to American Security.Â  She further generally denied Lenderâ€™s\r\n  counterclaim for prejudgment interest and attorneysâ€™ fees, and asserted her own\r\n  right to recover attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.Â  \r\nThe matter was referred to the Master-in-Equity by order dated\r\n  January 27, 2006.Â  Subsequently, both Blanding and Lender filed motions for\r\n  summary judgment seeking a determination of the partiesâ€™ rights with respect to\r\n  the casualty insurance proceeds paid for Blandingâ€™s foreclosed property.Â  Blanding\r\n  argued she was entitled to have the proceeds from the American Security policy\r\n  credited toward her debt and she was therefore due $35,908.77 from the Foremost\r\n  proceeds, while Lender was entitled to only $27,091.23.Â  In the alternative,\r\n  Blanding maintained the excess â€œother insuranceâ€ clause in the American\r\n  Security policy was void as a matter of law, and therefore the American\r\n  Security coverage was contributive insurance.Â  Under this application, Blanding\r\n  claimed entitlement to a credit of $27,216, leaving a balance due to Lender of\r\n  $22,279.14 and $40,720.86 due Blanding from the Foremost proceeds.Â  Lender asserted\r\n  the American Security policy provided excess coverage only, and that Blanding\r\n  was seeking to recover insurance proceeds to which she was not entitled and had\r\n  refused to endorse the Foremost check to allow the proceeds to be applied to\r\n  her debt.Â  Accordingly, Lender maintained it was entitled to recover prejudgment\r\n  interest and attorneysâ€™ fees incurred in the current litigation.Â  Blanding\r\n  argued Lender was not entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees as the mortgage had been\r\n  released, and any obligations under the mortgage agreement were therefore\r\n  terminated.Â  \r\nUpon consideration of the cross-motions for summary judgment, and\r\n  following a separate hearing on attorneysâ€™ fees, the Master ruled Lender was\r\n  â€œentitled to be paid for the debt owed at the time of foreclosure, less $2,500,\r\n  the amount bid by [Lender] at the foreclosure sale, plus pre-judgment interest,\r\n  [attorneysâ€™] fees, and costsâ€ from the proceeds available in this case.Â  The\r\n  master further determined the Foremost policy provided primary coverage while\r\n  the American Security policy provided secondary or excess coverage only, and\r\n  the insurance proceeds from Blandingâ€™s Foremost policy should be the first\r\n  applied to the sums secured by the mortgage agreement.Â  He found Lender\r\n  entitled to $49,495.14 on Blandingâ€™s debt due, plus $6,736.48 in prejudgment\r\n  interest and $6,768.38 in attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Accordingly, the Master ordered\r\n  Lender was entitled to the full amount of the $63,000 in available insurance\r\n  proceeds.Â  Blanding then filed a motion for reconsideration and to alter or\r\n  amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure which, with the exception of the deletion of one sentence from the\r\n  order, was denied.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  proper where no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Hurst v. E. Coast Hockey League, Inc., 371 S.C. 33, 36, 637 S.E.2d 560, 561\r\n  (2006).Â  On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard governing the trial court.Â  Id. Â at 35, 637\r\n  S.E.2d at 561.Â  The trial court should\r\n  grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.,\r\n  353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334 (2003).Â  In determining whether any\r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Law\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).\r\n  â€œA court considering summary judgment neither makes factual determinations nor\r\n  considers the merits of competing testimony; however, summary judgment is\r\n  completely appropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth facts that\r\n  remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.â€Â  David v. McLeod\r\nRegâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1, 5&nbsp;(2006).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Masterâ€™s Refusal to\r\n  Apply American Security Proceeds\r\nBlanding\r\n  first contends the master erred in failing to apply the insurance proceeds paid\r\n  by American Security to reduce her outstanding debt.Â  She argues that the\r\n  American Security payment of $22,403.91 was paid in settlement of the fire and,\r\n  under the terms of the mortgage agreement, these sums must therefore be applied\r\n  to her debt.Â  Specifically, she points to the language of the agreement that â€œany insurance proceeds, . . . shall be\r\n  applied to restoration or repair,â€ and ifÂ  â€œ restoration or repair is not\r\n  economically feasible . . . , the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the\r\n  sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the\r\n  excess, if any, paid to Borrower.â€Â  Blanding asserts this language requires\r\n  Lender to apply the proceeds of the American Security policy to her debt, and\r\n  that she is then entitled to any excess proceeds after application of both the\r\n  American Security and Foremost policy proceeds.Â  \r\nIn making this argument, Blanding does not dispute that the sums\r\n  originally paid by American Security were returned by Lender after discovery of\r\n  the Foremost coverage. Â However, she contends the return of those funds did not\r\n  â€œexpunge the payment of those proceedsâ€ nor alter the requirement that these\r\n  proceeds be applied to her mortgage debt.Â  Blanding makes several arguments as\r\n  to why the returned funds must be included in the payment of insurance proceeds\r\n  under the mortgage agreement.\r\nA.Â  â€œOther\r\n  Insuranceâ€ Clauses\r\nBlanding\r\n  argues the Masterâ€™s determination of which policy pays first is irrelevant, as\r\n  both insurers have already paid.Â  She asserts the â€œother insuranceâ€ clauses,\r\n  used by the Master to determine which policy was primary, do not apply because\r\n  this is not a contribution action between insurers, but a dispute between\r\n  insureds over proceeds that have already been paid.Â  Accordingly she maintains\r\n  the Master erroneously relied on the â€œother insuranceâ€ clauses in the two\r\n  policies in refusing to apply the American Security proceeds.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[C]ourts\r\n  faced with the distasteful chore of apportioning liabilities among multiple\r\n  insurers should look to the language of the policies to ascertain whether the\r\n  policies are intended to provide primary or secondary coverage.â€Â  S.C. Ins. Co. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc., 327 S.C. 207,\r\n  214, 489 S.E.2d 200, 203 (1997) (emphasis in original).Â  â€œIn other words, the relevant\r\n  question is not whether a policy is blanket or specific, but what is the â€˜total\r\n  policy insuring intentâ€™ embodied within the policy.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œOne method\r\n  insurance companies use to indicate whether they intend to provide primary,\r\n  secondary, or other coverage is to include in their policies â€˜other insuranceâ€™\r\n  clauses that attempt to apportion liability among multiple insurers.â€Â  Id. at 215, 489 S.E.2d at 204.Â  â€œAn â€˜excessâ€™ clause, the most common kind of â€˜other\r\n  insuranceâ€™ clause, provides a policy will cover only amounts exceeding the\r\n  policy limits of other insurance covering the same risk to the same property.â€Â  Id. \r\nWe\r\n  find disingenuous Blandingâ€™s assertion that the rules concerning determination\r\n  of policy coverage among more than one policy do not apply because this is an\r\n  action between insureds, as opposed to insurers.Â  The crux of this litigation\r\n  is which proceeds are available to be applied to the loss.Â  In the present\r\n  case, the mortgage agreement provides Blanding is required to maintain property\r\n  insurance naming Lender â€œas mortgagee and/or an additional loss payee.â€Â  In the\r\n  event of loss, the mortgage further provides: â€œthe insurance proceeds shall be\r\n  applied to the sums secured by [the mortgage agreement], whether or not then\r\n  due, with excess, if any, paid to Borrower.â€Â  Therefore, under the plain\r\n  and unambiguous terms of the mortgage agreement, any insurance proceeds must be\r\n  first applied to sums secured by the mortgage agreement, with any excess paid\r\n  to Blanding.Â  The American Security policy provided that if there were â€œany other valid or\r\n  collectible insurance which would attach if the insurance under this policy had\r\n  not been effected, this insurance shall apply only as excess and in no\r\n  event as contributing insurance and then only after all other insurance has\r\n    been exhausted.â€ Â (emphasis added). Â Here,\r\n  it is undisputed that the Foremost policy was collectible insurance that would\r\n  attach had the American Security policy not been effected.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  Foremost policy was sufficient to cover the loss of the insured property and,\r\n  thus, the American Security policy, as an excess policy, would provide no\r\n  proceeds.Â  \r\nB.Â  Policiesâ€™ Coverage of\r\n  the Same Interests for Same Insureds\r\nBlanding\r\n  maintains, however, even if the Master properly considered the â€œother\r\n  insuranceâ€ clauses to apply in a dispute between insureds, his analysis was\r\n  still flawed because, in order for the â€œother insuranceâ€ clauses to apply, the\r\n  policies must cover the same risk and same interest for the benefit of the same\r\n  insured over the same period of time.Â  She argues the policies cover different\r\n  interests for the benefit of different insureds, and therefore the â€œother\r\n  insuranceâ€ clauses are inapplicable.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur\r\n  courts have held that â€œâ€˜[o]ther insuranceâ€™ clauses are intended to apportion an\r\n  insured loss between or among insurers where two or more policies offer\r\n  coverage of the same risk and same interest for the benefit of the same insured\r\n  for the same period.â€Â  S.C. Ins. Co. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters,\r\n    Inc., 327 S.C. 207, 212, 489 S.E.2d 200, 202 (1997).Â  â€œThese clauses began\r\n  their lives as an attempt to prevent fraud in the overinsuring of property.â€Â  Id. Â Further, our courts have held that a mortgagor and mortgagee have separate and\r\n  distinct interests in the same property which they may insure.Â  Johnson v.\r\n    Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Co., 245 S.C. 205, 209, 140 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1965); Murdaugh\r\n      v. Traders &amp; Mechs. Ins. Co., 218 S.C. 299, 307-308, 62 S.E.2d 723,\r\n  726-27 (1950). Â \r\nWhile\r\n  we agree with Blanding that she and Lender had separate and distinct interests\r\n  in the property for insurance purposes, we disagree that, as a result, the two\r\n  policies in question fail to cover the same interests for the benefit of the\r\n  same insureds.Â  Although the parties have separate insurable interests, it is\r\n  possible for both to have contracted to insure the same insurable interest.Â  Thomas\r\n    v. Penn Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 244 S.C. 581, 585, 137 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1964).Â  The policy issued by Foremost\r\n  provided for $63,000 worth of coverage on Blandingâ€™s dwelling at her Pineville\r\n  address, naming Blanding as the insured but also denoting Washington Mutual as\r\n  the lienholder, as required by the mortgage agreement which states Blanding â€œshall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on\r\n  the Property insured against loss by fireâ€ and that â€œ[a]ll insurance policies\r\n  required by Lender and renewals of such policies . . . shall name Lender as\r\n  mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.â€Â  Accordingly, the Foremost\r\n  policy, while insuring Blandingâ€™s interest in the property, likewise insured\r\n  Lenderâ€™s interest in the property.Â  The American Security policy provided the\r\n  named insured mortgagee was Washington Mutual Bank, and named Blanding as the\r\n  additional insured.Â  It likewise insured the property at Blandingâ€™s Pineville\r\n  address stating, â€œit is agreed that the insurance applies to the property\r\n  described above and to any person shown as an Additional Insured with respect\r\n  to such property. . . .â€Â  It further noted â€œ[l]oss, if any, shall be adjusted with\r\n  and payable to the above Named Insured Mortgagee, and the Additional Insureds\r\n  as their interests may appear. . . .â€Â  Thus, the American Security policy\r\n  insured the same property, during the same period, against the same risk for\r\n  the benefit of the same insureds.Â  Both\r\n  policies were intended to provide coverage for the mortgaged property that was\r\n  security for the debt.Â  Thus, the two policies, while insuring the partiesâ€™\r\n  separate and distinct interests, each insured the same interest of the\r\n  mortgagor and the same interest of the mortgagee.Â  In other words, while\r\n  Blanding and Lender may have separate and distinct interests insured by the\r\n  policies, both policies insured both partiesâ€™ interests.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the two policies contracted to insure the same insurable interest, and there is\r\n  no merit to Blandingâ€™s assertion that the â€œother insuranceâ€ clause in the\r\n  American Security policy is inapplicable on this basis.Â  \r\nC.Â  â€œOther Insuranceâ€\r\n  Clause Conflict with Statutory Law\r\nFinally\r\n  Blanding claims, even if the policies did cover the same risks, interests, and\r\n  insureds during the same period of time, the â€œother insuranceâ€ clause in the\r\n  American Security policy conflicts with statutory law and is therefore\r\n  invalid.Â  Specifically, Blanding points to sections 38-75-20 and 38-75-220 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code of Laws in support of this argument. Section 38-75-20\r\n  provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  No\r\n    insurer doing business in this State may issue a fire insurance policy for more\r\n    than the value stated in the policy or the value of the property to be insured.\r\n    . . .Â  If two or more policies are written upon the same property, they are\r\n    considered to be contributive insurance, and, if the aggregate sum of all such\r\n    insurance exceeds the insurable value of the property, as agreed by the insurer\r\n    and the insured, each insurer, in the event of a total or partial loss, is\r\n    liable for its pro rata share of insurance.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-20\r\n  (2002).Â  Section 38-75-220 provides in part:\r\n\r\n  No\r\n    insurer transacting a mobile home insurance business in this State and writing\r\n    hazard insurance covering loss from physical damage to the mobile homes may\r\n    issue a policy for more than the value stated in the policy or the value of the\r\n    property to be insured. . . .Â  If two or more such policies are written upon\r\n    the same property and covering the same interests, they are considered to be\r\n    contributive insurance, and, if the aggregate sum of all such insurance exceeds\r\n    the insurable value of the property, as agreed by the insured and insurer, each\r\n    insurer, in the event of a total or partial loss, is liable for its pro rata\r\n    share of insurance.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-220\r\n  (2002).\r\nBlanding\r\n  argues, to the extent the two policies in question cover the same interests,\r\n  the â€œother insuranceâ€ clause in the American Security policy is invalid because\r\n  it conflicts with sections 38-75-20 and 38-75-220 of the South Carolina Code.Â \r\n  She argues under these sections such policies are deemed to be concurrent and\r\n  contributive as a matter of law, and as such, each insurer is primarily liable\r\n  for its pro rata share of the loss to the extent the aggregate sum of insurance\r\n  exceeds the insurable value of the property.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nâ€œ[I]f\r\n  policies insure the same entity and interest against the same casualty, then the\r\n  coverage provided by the policies is concurrent, thus requiring pro rata\r\n  contribution absent a contrary provision in an â€˜other insuranceâ€™ clause contained in one of the policies.â€Â  S.C. Ins. Co. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins.\r\n    Underwriters, Inc., 327 S.C. 207, 214, 489 S.E.2d 200, 203 (1997) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Here, the American Security policy contains an â€œother insuranceâ€\r\n  clause that provides â€œ[i]f\r\n  there is any other valid or collectible insurance which would attach if the\r\n  insurance under this policy had not been effected, this insurance shall apply\r\n  only as excess and in no event as contributing insurance and then only after\r\n  all other insurance has been exhausted.â€Â  Thus,\r\n  the policy language clearly provides to the contrary and the coverage provided\r\n  by the policy is not â€œconcurrent and contributive as a matter of law.â€\r\nII.Â  Award of Attorneysâ€™\r\n  Fees\r\nBlanding\r\n  raises as her next issue the propriety of the award of attorneysâ€™ fees.[4]Â \r\n  The Master determined attorneysâ€™ fees were warranted under the terms of the\r\n  mortgage agreement, which provided such fees became the additional debt of\r\n  Blanding.Â  Here, the mortgage agreement contains broad language regarding\r\n  Lendersâ€™ rights to recover attorneysâ€™ fees:\r\n\r\n  Protection of Lenderâ€™s Interest in the Property and Rights Under\r\n    this Security Agreement.Â \r\n    If . . . there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lenderâ€™s\r\n    interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as\r\n    a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement\r\n    of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce\r\n    laws or regulations) . . . then Lender may do and pay for whatever is\r\n    reasonable or appropriate to protect Lenderâ€™s interest in the Property and\r\n    rights under this Security Instrument . . . . Lenderâ€™s actions can include, but\r\n    are not limited to . . . (c) paying reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees to protect its\r\n    interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument. \r\n  Any amount disbursed by Lender under this [section] shall become\r\n    additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument.Â  \r\n\r\nBlanding maintains, however,\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees are not recoverable under the terms of the mortgage because\r\n  Lenderâ€™s rights under the mortgage were extinguished when the foreclosure\r\n  judgment was entered.Â  We disagree. \r\nBlanding\r\n  cites section 29-3-780 of the Code for the proposition that once Lender\r\n  foreclosed the mortgage and the property was sold, Lenderâ€™s lien against the\r\n  property was released, cancelled, and satisfied.Â  This section provides that â€œ[u]pon confirmation of the circuit court of the report of the master . . .\r\n  Â pursuant to decree of foreclosure, the officer of the court making the sale\r\n  shall cause to be recorded in the office where the foreclosed mortgage is recorded\r\n  a release, cancellation, and satisfaction of the lien. . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  29-3-780 (2007).Â  This section further provides, â€œHowever, nothing in this\r\n  section may be construed to satisfy any unpaid portion of the debt secured by\r\n  the mortgage.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, while the mortgage may well have been deemed\r\n  â€œreleased, cancelled, and satisfiedâ€ under this section, the sale is not\r\n  construed to satisfy any unpaid portion of the debt secured by the mortgage\r\n  agreement.Â  By the clear terms of the agreement, the attorneysâ€™ fees incurred\r\n  by Lender in pursuing the insurance proceeds became the additional debt of\r\n  Blanding secured by the mortgage agreement and were thus unpaid debt secured by\r\n  the mortgage agreement that remained unsatisfied under section 29-3-780.\r\nBlanding\r\n  further cites Ryan v. S. Mut. Bldg. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 50 S.C. 185, 27\r\n  S.E. 618 (1897) for the proposition that the mortgage agreement merged into the\r\n  foreclosure judgment such that the contract was extinguished, and therefore the\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fee provision was no longer viable.Â  However, Ryan involved a\r\n  suit for double the sum of interest collected by the defendant alleged to be\r\n  received in excess of lawful interest, challenging the collection of the money\r\n  as usurious, instituted subsequent to receipt of the proceeds in a foreclosure\r\n  judgment and sale.Â  Id. Â at 186, 27 S.E.2d at 618-19.Â  There, the court\r\n  determined the contract said to be usurious had become merged into the judgment\r\n  of foreclosure, extinguishing the original contract.Â  Id. at 190, 27\r\n  S.E. at 619. Â The court further noted â€œ[t]he judgment became a new debt,â€ and\r\n  was not â€œinfected by the usurious nature of the cause of action.â€Â  Id.Â  In so ruling, the court was guided by the law that â€œ[a] judgment is the final\r\n  determination of the rights of the parties in an action . . . and is conclusive\r\n  of all matter necessarily involved, whether raised or not; especially if the\r\n  party denying the adjudication knew of the matter, and could have interposed it\r\n  at the previous trial, either in support of a claim or as a defense.â€Â  Id. at 188, 27 S.E. at 619.Â  In the case at hand, Lender could not have raised the\r\n  issue of attorneysâ€™ fees incurred in the collection of the insurance proceeds,\r\n  as no insurance issues were implicated at that time since the property had not\r\n  yet been destroyed by fire.Â  Thus, this matter could not have been raised at\r\n  the foreclosure proceeding and we do not believe the mortgage agreement was\r\n  completely merged into the foreclosure such as to extinguish the broad\r\n  conveyance of rights to collect attorneysâ€™ fees in â€œa legal proceeding that might significantly affect\r\n  Lenderâ€™s interest in the Property and/or rights underâ€ the mortgage agreement.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the award of attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nIII.Â  Award of\r\n  Prejudgment Interest\r\nLastly, Blanding contends the Master erred in awarding prejudgment\r\n  interest to Lender, running from the date of issuance of the Foremost check to\r\n  Blanding until the date of the summary judgment hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nBlanding asserts the $49,495.14 awarded to Lender from the\r\n  insurance proceeds does not constitute damages and this is, therefore, not a\r\n  liquidated damages case with a stated account.Â  She further maintains she never\r\n  had possession or control of the proceeds and, accordingly, could not have paid\r\n  the proceeds to Lender.Â  â€œThe\r\n  law has long allowed prejudgment interest on obligations to pay money from the\r\n  time when, either by agreement of the parties or operation of law, the payment is demandable, if the sum is certain or\r\n  capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v.\r\n    Court St., LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 133, 631, S.E.2d 252, 258 (2006).Â  Thus, â€œthe proper test for determining whether\r\n  prejudgment interest may be awarded is whether the measure of recovery, not\r\n  necessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time\r\n  the claim arose.â€Â  Id. Â at 133, 631 S.E.2d at 259.Â  Consequently, â€œ[t]he\r\n  right of a party to prejudgment interest is not affected by\r\n  rights of discount or offset claimed by the opposing party.â€Â  Id. Â at 133-34,\r\n  631 S.E.2d at 259.Â  Rather, â€œ[i]t is the character of the claim and not the\r\n  defense to it that determines whether prejudgment interest is allowable.â€Â  Id. Â at 134, 631 S.E.2d at 259.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Blandingâ€™s indebtedness was certain throughout litigation.Â  The measure of\r\n  recovery was fixed by conditions existing at the time the proceeds were\r\n  issued.Â  Accordingly, Blanding was obligated to pay the insurance proceeds when\r\n  she received them in May 2005.Â  We further find no merit to Blandingâ€™s\r\n  assertion she had no control over the proceeds because the check was made out\r\n  to her along with Lender.Â  She merely had to endorse the check along with\r\n  Lender to have the proceeds applied to her debt.Â  \r\nBlanding\r\n  also argues Lender is entitled to no more than $49,495.14 from the available\r\n  insurance proceeds as that is the extent of Lenderâ€™s interest in the property\r\n  at the time of the fire.Â  Thus, she maintains, by awarding prejudgment\r\n  interest, the Master effectively allowed Lenders to recover a deficiency\r\n  judgment.Â  However, the award of prejudgment interest did not alter or add to\r\n  the Lenderâ€™s interest in the property. Â As noted by the master, â€œ[t]he\r\n  foreclosure judgment fixed the amount of [Blandingâ€™s] debt and was a final\r\n  adjudication thereof.Â  The award of prejudgment interest does not alter the\r\n  foreclosure judgment.Â  The interest is being awarded on top of the amount due\r\n  and owing, not in alteration of that amount.â€\r\nBlanding\r\n  next contends if Lenders are entitled to prejudgment interest on their interest\r\n  in the proceeds, she is likewise entitled to prejudgment interest on the\r\n  remaining insurance proceeds that she was due after payment of her debt.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  In her complaint, Blanding sought application of available insurance\r\n  proceeds.Â  Lenders admitted the Foremost Insurance proceeds were to be applied\r\n  to Blandingâ€™s debt, but denied that they refused to apply any other available\r\n  insurance proceeds, i.e. those form the American Security policy.Â  As\r\n  previously found, the Foremost policy was sufficient to cover the loss of the\r\n  insured property and, thus, the American Security policy, as an excess policy,\r\n  provided no proceeds for the loss.Â  Had Blanding relinquished the sum certain\r\n  due Lenders at the time the proceeds were issued to her, she would have\r\n  received the excess proceeds from the Foremost policy at that time.Â  It is\r\n  clear Lenders sought only their share of the proceeds from the Foremost policy\r\n  when this action was instituted by Blanding.Â  Because Lenders did not deny\r\n  Blanding her interest in the excess, we find no merit to her assertion she is\r\nentitled to prejudgment interest. \r\nBlanding also contends the original foreclosure judgment included\r\n  $7,517 in prejudgment interest on her debt and that by including prejudgment\r\n  interest on this same debt, the Masterâ€™s award amounted to a double recovery of\r\n  prejudgment interest.Â  Blanding fails to recognize, however, that this is a\r\n  separate proceeding seeking insurance proceeds that were due to Lender.Â  The\r\n  prejudgment interest awarded by the Master here does not reflect that amount\r\n  due in prejudgment interest from the mortgage foreclosure, but from the\r\n  interest accrued from the time the insurance proceeds from the fire were made\r\n  available by the Foremost check to Blanding, but were not paid to Lender as\r\n  due.\r\nFinally, Blanding argues, because the parties deposited the\r\n  proceeds into the Clerkâ€™s Office by consent, she is relieved of any liability\r\n  for prejudgment interest.Â  She further asserts in a footnote that should Lender\r\n  be entitled to an award of prejudgment interest, she should be allowed to\r\n  offset the interest earned on the funds while on deposit with the Clerk.Â  \r\nIn reviewing the record before us, it does not appear either of\r\n  these arguments was raised to the Master in the summary judgment arguments.Â  In\r\n  her motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, Blanding stated\r\n  only, â€œTo the extent that any prejudgment interest is awarded to [Lender],\r\n  [Blanding] is entitled to offset against any such award the interest earned\r\n  while the funds were on deposit with the Clerk.â€Â  In the hearing on her motion\r\n  for reconsideration, Blanding questioned how the court intended â€œto treat the\r\n  interest paid on the proceeds since their deposit with the court,â€ stating that\r\n  the Clerk pays interest on the funds deposited at around 4.5 percent.Â  The\r\n  Master indicated he was â€œnot aware of that,â€ did not know if that was correct,\r\n  and stated the matter was not before him.Â  He concluded, â€œI do not know\r\n  anything about any interest that the Clerk of Court has been awarding on this\r\n  money and I am not going to do that.â€Â  Accordingly, it appears Blandingâ€™s\r\n  argument that she had no liability based upon the deposit of the\r\n  funds with the Clerk was never raised to the Master and therefore is not\r\n  properly preserved on appeal.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach,\r\n  339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€). Â As\r\n  to the offset argument, this contention was first raised in Blandingâ€™s motion\r\n  for reconsideration and therefore is not preserved for review. Â See Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 399, 608 S.E.2d 849, 854 (2005) (holding that an\r\n  issue first raised in a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review).[5]\r\nBased\r\n  upon the foregoing, the decision of the Master is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\npursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Collectively, Long Beach Mortgage Company, Washington\r\n  Mutual, Inc. and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company are the lender and\r\ndefendants in this case (hereinafter â€œLenderâ€).Â  \r\n[3] The check initially issued by Foremost, in the amount\r\n  of $62,750, represents the total amount of coverage less the $250 deductible.Â \r\n  Later, when the initial check expired and Blanding requested a new one,\r\nForemost issued a check in the amount of $63,000, instead of $62,750.Â  \r\n[4] In the present case, the master awarded Lender\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees in the amount of $6,768.38, which is the amount of proceeds\r\n  remaining after the debt ($49,495.14) and prejudgment interest ($6,736.48) were\r\n  satisfied.Â  The amount of attorneysâ€™ fees, which is only a small portion of the\r\n$39,335.50 Lender asserted it incurred, is not in dispute. \r\n[5] We would note that the Master found Lender entitled\r\n  to a total judgment of $63,000 from the insurance proceeds, inclusive of\r\n  prejudgment interest.Â  Lender will receive this specific amount, and thus\r\n  Blanding should ultimately receive any remaining accrued interest on the\r\n$63,000 deposited with the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4388","title":"Horry County v.

Â In case a building, structure, or land is or is\r\n    proposed to be used in violation of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this\r\n    chapter, the zoning administrator or other appropriate administrative officer .\r\n    . . . may in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or\r\n    other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent the unlawful . . . . use, or\r\n    to correct or abate the violation . . . .\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Horry County zoning ordinance Section 1303 states:\r\n\r\n  (A) It shall be unlawful to use, occupy or permit the use or\r\n    occupancy of any building, mobile home, or premises, or all or parts thereof\r\n    hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or\r\n    enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of zoning compliance shall\r\n    have been issued therefore by the zoning administrator stating that the\r\n    proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of the\r\n    ordinance.Â  (B) Failure to obtain a certificate of zoning compliance shall be a\r\n    violation of this ordinance punishable under section 1308 of this ordinance.\r\n\r\nViolating section 1303, as provided in section 1308, constitutes a\r\n  misdemeanor:\r\n\r\n  Any person violating any provisions of this ordinance shall be\r\n    guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be imprisoned for a period\r\n    not to exceed thirty (30) days and/or fined not more than two hundred dollars\r\n    ($200.00) for each offense.Â  Each day such violation continues shall constitute\r\n    a separate offense.Â  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the county from\r\n    taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.\r\n\r\nA criminal\r\n  trial was held in magistrateâ€™s court, and Appellants requested a jury trial.Â  After\r\n  Horry County rested its case, Appellants moved for a dismissal of all\r\n  charges.Â  The magistrate granted Appellantâ€™s motion for dismissal and\r\n  inculcated â€œthe County has not met the allegations of this zoning ordinance in\r\n  proving 1303.â€Â  Horry County appealed the magistrateâ€™s ruling to the circuit\r\n  court after Appellantsâ€™ acquittal on March 8, 2005.Â  Though the magistrate â€œprayedâ€\r\n  for the circuit court to dismiss Horry Countyâ€™s appeal with prejudice, the circuit court found it had both subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction over the issues raised in the appeal and personal jurisdiction\r\n  over the Appellants.Â  Appellants moved to dismiss Horry Countyâ€™s appeal based\r\n  on the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the federal and state constitutions and sought\r\n  sanctions for Horry Countyâ€™s pursuit of its appeal, averring the appeal was\r\n  frivolous and violated the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceeding Sanction Act.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the circuit court found Horry Countyâ€™s claim, â€œthe dancersâ€™ failure to\r\n  completely and opaquely cover their breasts violated [section] 1303 (A) by\r\n  changing or altering Thee Doll House â€˜useâ€™ fromÂ  a permissible nightclub into\r\n  its â€˜useâ€™ as an adult entertainment establishment,â€ meritorious.Â  The circuit\r\n  court elucidated:Â  â€œUnder [the Countyâ€™s] theory, [section] 1303 required the\r\n  dancers and duty manager to wait until after Thee Doll House sought and\r\n  successfully obtained a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for its use as an\r\n  adult entertainment establishment before using or permitting Thee Doll House to\r\n  be used that way.â€Â  However, the circuit court found double jeopardy prevented Appellants\r\n  from being retried under the same charges.Â  Finally, the circuit court denied\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs because the case before the magistrate\r\n  was criminal in nature and not a civil proceeding.Â  Appellantsâ€™ motion to alter\r\n  or amend the circuit courtâ€™s judgment was denied.\r\n\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220\r\n  (2006); State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State\r\n    v. Rice, 372 S.C. 302, 314, 652 S.E.2d 409, 414 (Ct.

Â This\r\n  court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 215, 641 S.E.2d 873, 877\r\n  (2007); State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111\r\n  (2000); State v. Edwards, 374 S.C. 543, 553, 649 S.E.2d 112, 117 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007); State v.\r\n    Patterson, 367 S.C. 219,\r\n  224, 625 S.E.2d 239, 241 (Ct. App. 2006); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97,\r\n  101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004); see also State v. Abdullah,\r\n  357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nOn\r\n  review, we are limited to determining whether the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion. Â State v. Laney, 367 S.C. 639, 643, 627 S.E.2d 726, 729\r\n  (2006); State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 43, 503 S.E.2d 747, 751 (1998); State v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 23, 564 S.E.2d 331, 333 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling is supported by any evidence. Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d\r\n  at 829; State v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 473-74, 649 S.E.2d 84, 86 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 583, 575 S.E.2d 852, 855\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Error in Ruling on\r\n  Merits of Countyâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â  Double\r\n  Jeopardy\r\nAppellants maintain the circuit court violated the\r\n  Double Jeopardy Clause by ruling on Horry Countyâ€™s appeal after they were acquitted\r\n  in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  We agree. \r\nThe United States Constitution and the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution protect against double jeopardy. Â See U.S. Const. Amend. V (â€œ[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in\r\n  jeopardy of life or limb . . . .); S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 12 (â€œNo person shall\r\n  be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or liberty,\r\n  nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\r\n  himself.â€); see also State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 457, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 872, 876 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United\r\n  States and South Carolina Constitutions protect citizens from being placed\r\n  twice in jeopardy of life or liberty.â€); State v. Cuccia, 353 S.C. 430,\r\n  434, 578 S.E.2d 45, 47 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œBoth the United States Constitution\r\n  and the South Carolina Constitution protect against double jeopardy.â€).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant is protected from:Â  (1) a second\r\n  prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for\r\n  the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple prosecution for the same\r\n  offense after an improvidently granted mistrial.Â  State v.

Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 343 (1975); Stevenson\r\n    v. State, 335 S.C. 193, 198, 516 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1999); McMullin v. S.C.\r\n      Depâ€™t of Revenue &amp; Taxation, 321 S.C. 475, 478, 469 S.E.2d 600, 602\r\n  (1996); State v. Owens, 309 S.C. 402, 405, 424 S.E.2d 473, 475 (1992).Â  \r\nThe United States has a long history of this\r\n  constitutional protection: \r\n\r\n  If there\r\n    is anything settled in the jurisprudence of England and America, it is that no man can be twice lawfully punished for the same offence. And though there\r\n    have been nice questions in the application of this rule to cases in which the\r\n    act charged was such as to come within the definition of more than one\r\n    statutory offence, or to bring the party within the jurisdiction of more than\r\n    one court, there has never been any doubt of its entire and complete protection\r\n    of the party when a second punishment is proposed in the same court, on the\r\n    same facts, for the same statutory offence.\r\n\r\nEx Parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 168 (1873).Â  The Supreme Court explicated:\r\n  â€œPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy\r\n  jurisprudence has been that â€˜(a) verdict of acquittal . . . could not be\r\n  reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting (a defendant) twice in\r\n  jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.â€™â€Â  U.S. v. Martin Linen\r\n    Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977) (citing U.S. v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671, (1896)).Â  The Supreme Court reiterated the purpose of the Double Jeopardy\r\n  Clause: Â â€œThe standard way for a defendant to secure a final judgment in her\r\n  favor is to gain an acquittal . . . . [T]he â€˜primary purposeâ€™ of the Double\r\n  Jeopardy Clause is to â€˜protect the integrityâ€™ of final determinations of guilt\r\n  or innocence. Â Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U.S. 101, 120 (2003)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  Moreover: \r\n\r\n  An\r\n    acquittal is accorded special weight. Â The constitutional protection against\r\n    double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal,\r\n    for the public interest in the finality of criminal judgments is so strong that\r\n    an acquitted defendant may not be retried even though the acquittal was based\r\n    upon an egregiously erroneous foundation . . . . The law attaches particular\r\n    significance to an acquittal.Â  \r\n\r\nU.S. v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 129 (internal citations omitted). \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has long recognized the\r\n  State has no right of appeal from an acquittal in a criminal case.Â  See State\r\n    v. McKnight, 353 S.C. 238, 239, 577 S.E.2d 456, 457 (2003) (â€œBased\r\n  primarily upon the double jeopardy provisions of the Constitution, we have long\r\n  recognized that the State has no right of appeal from a judgment of acquittal\r\n  in a criminal case . . . . These cases are premised upon the basic double\r\n  jeopardy principle that a defendant in a criminal prosecution is in legal\r\n  jeopardy when he has been placed upon trial under a valid indictment and a\r\n  competent jury has been sworn.â€); State v. Rogers, 198 S.C. 273, 278, 17\r\n  S.E.2d 563, 565 (1941) (â€œ[I]t is well settled that no writ of error, appeal, or\r\n  other proceeding lies on behalf of the state to review or to set aside a\r\n  verdict or a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case, although there may have\r\n  been error committed by the court, or a perverse finding by the jury.â€); State\r\n    v. Lynn, 120 S.C. 258, 260, 113 S.E. 74, 75 (1922) (â€œ[T]he state has no\r\n  right of appeal from judgment upon verdict of acquittal in a criminal case\r\n  seems to have been recognized and accepted as the law of this jurisdiction from\r\n  the beginning of our judicial history.â€).Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Holiday, the supreme court held the State has no right of appeal from an\r\n  acquittal in a criminal case unless the acquittal was procured by the accused\r\n  through fraud or collusion.Â  255 S.C. 142, 145, 177 S.E.2d 541, 542 (1970).Â  The\r\n  court articulated, â€œWhile a limited right of appeal in criminal cases has been\r\n  conferred upon the State by statute in a number of jurisdictions, the extent of\r\n  the right of the prosecution to appeal in this jurisdiction has been defined by\r\n  our judicial decisions.Â  Id. at 144, 177 S.E.2d at 542.Â  \r\nMore\r\n  recently, in State v. Tillinghast, the supreme court concluded the State\r\n  did not have a right to appeal a magistrate courtâ€™s ruling to the circuit court\r\n  after Defendantâ€™s acquittal.Â  375 S.C. 201, 203, 652 S.E.2d 400, 401 (2007).Â  The\r\n  Defendant was charged with possession of alcohol by a minor and was granted his\r\n  motion for a directed verdict in the magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Id. at 202, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 401.Â  The State appealed to the circuit court and argued the\r\n  magistrate erred by directing a verdict of not guilty.Â  Id.Â  Â The State\r\n  did not seek reinstatement of the charge but sought review of the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  finding the statute was unconstitutional.Â  Id. Â The circuit court found\r\n  it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and found the magistrate erred in its\r\n  ruling.Â  Id.Â  In reversing the circuit court, the supreme court\r\n  asserted, â€œWhether or not the magistrate erred in [its] ruling of law,\r\n  appellant was acquitted and is now out of court.Â  The circuit court erred by\r\n  finding the State may appeal the magistrateâ€™s ruling.â€ Id. at Â 203, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 401.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find Tillinghast controlling of the issues in the case sub judice.Â  Â Though\r\n  the parties concede Appellants cannot be retried again on the criminal zoning\r\n  charges under double jeopardy principles, the circuit court found it had both\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction over the issues raised in the appeal and personal\r\n  jurisdiction over the Appellants.Â  The purpose of Horry Countyâ€™s appeal to the\r\n  circuit court was to obtain a review of the magistrateâ€™s interpretation of an Horry County zoning ordinance.Â  Horry County posits â€œ[w]hether the State may appeal a\r\n  magistrateâ€™s order of acquittal, entered on an erroneous interpretation of law,\r\n  for the limited purpose of gaining review of that error of, without seeking to\r\n  retry the defendants, appears to be a muddled question in South Carolina.â€Â  We\r\n  disagree and find circuit courts do not possess authority to review possible\r\n  legal errors of the magistrate after an acquittal.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s analysis regarding interpretation of Horry County Zoning\r\n  Ordinance Section 1303.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Advisory Opinions\r\nAppellants asseverate by appealing a ruling it knew\r\n  was not appealable, Horry County essentially asked the circuit court to render\r\n  an advisory opinion on the propriety of the magistrateâ€™s rulings.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œIt is elementary\r\n  that the courts of this State have no jurisdiction to issue advisory opinions.â€Â  Booth v. Grissom, 265 S.C. 190, 192, 217 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1975); see\r\n    also Hitter v. McLeod, 274 S.C. 616, 618, 266 S.E.2d 418, 420 (1980)\r\n  (â€œ[I]t does not ipso facto confer jurisdiction on this Court, or the court\r\n  below, to render an advisory opinion, which we have repeatedly refused to do\r\n  even on constitutional issues. . . .â€); McDill v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 368 S.C. 29, 32, 627 S.E.2d 749, 750 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œ[A] court is not permitted\r\n  to issue advisory opinions.â€).Â  A court renders an advisory opinion when\r\n  commenting on an issue will have no practical effect on the outcome of the\r\n  case.Â  See Shasta Beverages v. S.C. Tax Comâ€™n, 280 S.C. 48, 56,\r\n  310 S.E.2d 655, 659 (1983) (â€œIt is not the role of this [c]ourt to advise the\r\n  legislative or executive branches how to proceed, nor to render an advisory\r\n  opinion on a hypothetical situation.â€); Commâ€™r. of Pub. Works v. S.C. Depâ€™t.\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 372 S.C. 351, 641 S.E.2d 763 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (declining to address an issue which would be merely advisory in nature); Binkley\r\n    v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58,\r\n  76 n. 36, 558 S.E.2d 902, 911 n. 36 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThis court will not issue\r\n  advisory opinions that have no practical effect on the outcome.â€).Â  \r\nOther than granting\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ motion to dismiss and ruling on whether to award attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  and costs, the circuit court had no authority to rule upon any matter raised in\r\n  Horry Countyâ€™s appeal.Â  The role of the circuit court, or any state court, is\r\n  not to give advice or render advisory opinions on hypothetical situations.Â  See Shasta Beverages, 280 S.C. at 56, 310 S.E.2d at 659.Â  By addressing Horry Countyâ€™s issues, the circuit court advised Horry County on what constitutes appropriate\r\n  action under and how to interpret a county ordinance.Â  Such a decision had no\r\n  practical effect on the outcome of a contested issue because Appellants were\r\n  already acquitted of the charges against them.Â  Under South Carolina\r\n  jurisprudence, the circuit court had no authority to comment on or render a\r\n  decision regarding Horry County Zoning Ordinance Section 1303.\r\nBecause\r\n  we find the circuit court lacked authority, we need not address Appellantâ€™s\r\n  second and third issues on appeal.Â  See Wilson v. Moseley, 327\r\n  S.C. 144, 147, 488 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1997) (holding when an appellate court\r\n  affirms the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on a dispositive ground,\r\n  the appellate court need not address the remaining issues on appeal); Fuller-Ahrens\r\n    Pâ€™ship v.

App. 1985) (determining discussion of remaining issues was unnecessary after reversing\r\n  a directed verdict).Â  \r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and\r\n  Costs\r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the circuit court erred as a matter of law by denying their motion for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil\r\n  Proceedings Sanctions Act (the Act).Â  Specifically, Appellants assert the\r\n  Countyâ€™s appeal to the circuit court was reviewed as a civil proceeding because\r\n  it was an appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded under the Act is\r\n  treated as one in equity, and in reviewing the award at issue this court may\r\n  take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Hanahan v. Simpson,\r\n  326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1997); Rutland v. Holler,\r\n    Dennis, Corbett, Ormond &amp; Garner (Law Firm), 371 S.C. 91, 97, 637\r\n  S.E.2d 316, 319 (Ct. App. 2006). Â â€œ â€˜[F]ollowing the determination of facts, an\r\n  appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the\r\n  decision to award sanctions and the specific sanctions awarded.â€™ â€ Rutland, 371 S.C. at 97, 637 S.E.2d at 319 (quoting Ex parte Beard, 359\r\n  S.C. 351, 357, 597 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 2004)). \r\nAttorneys\r\n  and individuals who take part in frivolous litigation may be sanctioned under\r\n  the Act.Â  See S.C. Code Â§Â§15-36-10 to -50 (2005) (amended by Â§15-36-10\r\n  (Supp. 2007)).Â  The Act in effect at the time Horry County gave notice of its\r\n  appeal to the circuit court, on March 9, 2005, provides:[1]Â Â  \r\n\r\n  Any\r\n    person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense\r\n    of any civil proceeding is subject to being assessed for payment of all or a\r\n    portion of the attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs of the other party if:Â  \r\n  (1) he\r\n    does so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper\r\n    discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claim upon which the\r\n    proceedings are based; and\r\n  (2) the\r\n    proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an assessment of the\r\n    fees and costs.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Â§ 15-36-10.\r\nConcomitantly,\r\n  in order for a litigant to receive attorneyâ€™s fees and costs under the Act, the\r\n  litigant has the burden of establishing:\r\n\r\n  (1) the\r\n    other party has procured, initiated, continued, or defended the civil proceedings against him;\r\n  (2) the\r\n    proceedings were terminated in his favor;\r\n  (3) the\r\n    primary purpose for which the proceedings were procured, initiated, continued,\r\n    or defended was not that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties,\r\n    or adjudication of the civil proceedings;\r\n  (4) the\r\n    aggrieved person has incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs; and\r\n  (5) the\r\n    amount of the fees and costs set forth in item.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-40\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The original proceedings in magistrate court were criminal\r\n  rather than civil in nature.Â  However, Appellants argue once Horry County appealed the magistrateâ€™s findings to the circuit court, or the court of common\r\n  pleas, the case was converted into a civil proceeding.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure govern â€œthe procedure in all South Carolina courts in all suits of a civil nature whether cognizable as cases at law or\r\n  in equity. . . .â€ Rule 1, SCRCP; see also State v. Brown, 344\r\n  S.C. 302, 307, 543 S.E.2d 568, 571 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe scope of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure is limited to â€˜all suits of a civil nature\r\n  whether cognizable as cases at law or in equity.â€™â€).Â  In State v. Brown,\r\n  a defendant appealed a magistrateâ€™s ruling on a criminal charge against him to\r\n  the circuit court.Â  Id. at 304, 543 S.E.2d at 569.Â  At issue before this\r\n  court was whether Brown had to serve notice of appeal on the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Public Safety (SCDPS) pursuant to Rule 74, SCRCP.Â  Id. at 305-06, 543 S.E.2d at 570.Â  There, we clarified: Â â€œThe dilemma . . . has\r\n  arisen because criminal appeals from magistrates are heard in courts that\r\n  operate under the Rules of Civil Procedure.â€Â  Id. at 305, 543 S.E.2d at\r\n  570.Â  Ultimately this court found Rule 74 applied only to civil actions and did\r\n  not apply to Brownâ€™s appeal because his original action was criminal in\r\n  nature.Â  Id. at 307, 543 S.E.2d at 571.Â  \r\nFollowing Brown, we find Horry Countyâ€™s appeal to the circuit court was criminal\r\n  rather than civil in nature because Appellants originally faced criminal charges\r\n  before the magistrate.Â  We hold the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure\r\n  rather than the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply when parties\r\n  appeal a magistrateâ€™s ruling in a criminal case to the circuit court.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the Act does not apply to the proceedings concerning Appellants.Â  The circuit\r\n  court did not err by denying attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to the Act. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit\r\n  court violated the double jeopardy provision of the federal and state\r\n  constitutions by allowing Horry Countyâ€™s appeal.Â  Moreover, by addressing the\r\n  issues raised by Horry County, the circuit court erroneously issued an advisory\r\n  opinion.Â  The circuit court properly denied Appellantâ€™s motion for attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and costs.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nREVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The provisions of this Act are outlined in sections\r\n  15-36-10 to 15-36-50.Â  Â We note that section 15-36-10 was completely revised and\r\n  became effective on July 1, 2005, and sections 15-36-20 through -50 were\r\n  repealed effective March 21, 2005. Â Because Horry County filed their motion of\r\n  appeal to the circuit court on March 9, 2005, the original Act still governed the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  For purposes of this analysis, we reference the\r\n  former version of the Act.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4389","title":"Ward v.

(West Oil).Â  The machines\r\n  sold tickets, called â€œPots of Gold,â€ with potential for winning prizes.Â  On\r\n  September 11, 2001, Ward and Hodge met with Lex West, Jr. (West), owner of West\r\n  Oil, and Camp Seegars (Seegars), an employee of West Oil, to discuss the\r\n  possibility of placing the machines.Â  Seegars was West Oilâ€™s Director of\r\n  Operations and oversaw its twenty-four convenience stores.Â  This was the first\r\n  time the parties met; they had never done business together before.\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  gave West Oil an overview of their machines and presented West Oil with a form contract,\r\n  entitled â€œExclusive Agreement,â€ that R&amp;B obtained from its machine\r\n  supplier.Â  The typewritten contract consisted of eleven paragraphs.Â  West Oil agreed\r\n  to place the machines initially at four of their stores.Â  The terms of the\r\n  agreement were negotiated at this meeting.Â  West Oil expressed its desire to\r\n  reduce the term of the agreement from the three years R&amp;B proposed to one\r\n  year and to collect a $500 placement fee from R&amp;B for each machine situated\r\n  in its stores.Â  R&amp;Bâ€™s typical agreement was to split the profits, defined\r\n  as the total money taken in by the machines less the payouts and cost of the\r\n  tickets from the manufacturer, with the location owner.Â  West Oil wanted\r\n  R&amp;B to absorb the cost of the tickets in the machines in its stores.Â  R&amp;B\r\n  was agreeable to the modifications because of their desire to place their\r\n  machines in such a large operatorâ€™s stores.Â  \r\nThere\r\n  were some discussions regarding termination of the contract.Â  West Oil contends\r\n  it wanted the ability for either party to terminate the contract at will.Â  At\r\n  trial, Seegars testified that West Oil â€œwanted a way out because what if down\r\n  the road they didnâ€™t like us or we didnâ€™t like them.Â  That was put into that\r\n  clause.â€Â  Both parties understood the impending arrival of the South Carolina\r\n  Education Lottery was a concern to West Oil, and it did not want the presence\r\n  of R&amp;Bâ€™s machines to jeopardize its ability to become a lottery retailer.Â  R&amp;B\r\n  advances they intended for West Oil to be able to terminate the contract only\r\n  if their machines prohibited West Oil from selling lottery tickets.\r\nII.Â  Execution of\r\n  Agreement\r\nTwo\r\n  days later, on September 13, 2001, Ward, Hodge, and Seegars met again.Â  West\r\n  did not attend this meeting, so Seegars alone represented West Oil.Â  R&amp;B\r\n  brought a revised, typed contract.Â  The parties do not dispute that their\r\n  agreement was for R&amp;B to pay West Oil a $500 placement fee for each\r\n  machine.Â  The parties were to evenly split the profits (total money taken in by\r\n  the machine less the payouts made by West Oil), and R&amp;B was to absorb the\r\n  costs of the tickets.Â  The revised contract was for a one year term. Â \r\nThe revised contract contained no language allowing termination of\r\n  the agreement if the relationship between the parties was no longer amicable.Â  The typewritten contract R&amp;B presented to West\r\n  Oil on September 13 included the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n  7.Â \r\n    In the event of any breach of this Agreement, it is recognized by both parties\r\n    that remedies at law are inadequate given the highly competitive nature of this\r\n    industry, and the difficulty of finding alternative locations not committed to\r\n    existing agreements.Â  OWNER further acknowledges the unique nature of the\r\n    location.Â  OWNER further acknowledges that the loss of this location will\r\n    result in irreparable harm to R&amp;B.Â  As a result, the parties agree that\r\n    either party may, without notice to the other party, petition in court of\r\n    competent jurisdiction and obtain a restraining order and/or injunction\r\n    requiring compliance with the terms of this Agreement.Â  Notwithstanding the\r\n    forgoing, in the event of a breach, in addition to any other remedy available,\r\n    R&amp;B may elect to terminate this Agreement and remove all game promotions\r\n    materials and equipment without interference from OWNER and shall be entitled\r\n    to liquidated damages in an amount equal to R&amp;Bâ€™s highest weekly share of\r\n    the net proceeds prior to said breach, multiplied by the number of weeks\r\n    remaining in the unexpired term of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nSeegars wrote an additional provision (the Addition) at the top of\r\n  the contract:\r\n\r\n  Addition\r\n    * In event of contract termination up front placement money will be re-imbursed\r\n    [sic] at pro-rated time with no penalties to either party of this contract.Â \r\n    This is added this day September 13th [sic] 2001 [sic]\r\n  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  CSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  RHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  CW\r\n  \r\n\r\nSeegars,\r\n  Hodge, and Ward each initialed below the handwritten addition.Â  All three\r\n  signed the bottom of the contract.Â  The contract originally specified four\r\n  store locations where machines were to be placed.Â  The machines performed well,\r\n  and the parties agreed orally to place the machines in more stores over time.Â \r\n  Eventually, West Oil authorized the placement of machines in thirteen\r\n  additional stores.\r\nIII.Â  Ticket Sales\r\nInitially, each ticket machine held a total of $4,800 worth of\r\n  â€œredâ€ tickets at a time.Â  When the red tickets sold out, R&amp;B would remove\r\n  the money, pay the portion due to West Oil, and refill the machine with red\r\n  tickets.Â  In late 2001, R&amp;B\r\n  approached Seegars about changing the game from the red tickets to new â€œgreenâ€\r\n  tickets.Â  Seegars hesitated because West Oilâ€™s accounting system was programmed\r\n  for the red tickets, but R&amp;B insisted the green tickets would be more\r\n  profitable for both R&amp;B and West Oil.Â  Seegars allowed the green tickets to\r\n  be placed in one store in Bishopville.Â  West Oil contends the change to the new\r\n  game was only authorized for that one store, and R&amp;B posit the contract\r\n  gives them exclusive authority to decide what games to place in their\r\n  machines.Â  The contract states â€œR&amp;B shall exclusively supply to OWNER any\r\n  and all game promotions materials equipment for and upon the premises,\r\n  including but not limited to, contests, games of chance, sweepstakes, prizes,\r\n  tickets, ticket dispensing equipment, advertisement materials, and product\r\n  services related to, or in connection with, such game promotions. . . .â€ \r\nIV.Â  Contract\r\n  Termination and Subsequent Proceedings\r\nR&amp;B began adding the new green tickets to store locations\r\n  other than the one store in Bishopville.Â  According to West Oil, this change\r\n  was not authorized.Â  Seegars became upset\r\n  when he learned of this at a meeting of store supervisors.Â  West asked Seegars\r\n  if he authorized placement of the new game.Â  Seegars informed West that he did\r\n  so for only one store, and West instructed him to leave the meeting to phone\r\n  R&amp;B and direct them to remove their machines from all West Oil stores.Â  \r\nR&amp;B\r\n  complied with West Oilâ€™s request and removed the machines.Â  R&amp;B counted the\r\n  money in each machine and determined how much the partially played deck of\r\n  cards had paid out.Â  R&amp;B compensated West Oil for the payouts and their\r\n  share of the profits from each machine.\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  filed a complaint asserting a\r\n  breach of contract claim against West Oil seeking over $800,000 in damages.Â  West Oil filed a counterclaim against\r\n  R&amp;B alleging breach of contract for selling products not authorized under\r\n  the contract.Â  The matter was referred to\r\n  a special referee who conducted a trial.Â  The special referee determined:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court finds that a written, enforceable contract existed for the initial four\r\n    ticket machines.Â  That contract was terminated.Â  Under the handwritten Addition\r\n    to the contract: â€œIn the event of contract termination, up front placement\r\n    money will be reimbursed at pro-rated time with no penalties to either party of\r\n    this contract.â€Â  (ex. A:1)Â  The up front placement money was $500 per machine.Â \r\n    This also applied for the thirteen additional machines that were added at other\r\n    locations.Â  Therefore, the plaintiffs initially paid the defendants $8,500 in\r\n    up front placement money.Â  Under the plaintiffâ€™s calculation, the machines were\r\n    in place for twenty-one weeks.Â  Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to be\r\n    reimbursed the pro-rated portion of the up front placement money, which equals\r\n    $5,067.31.Â  [footnote omitted]\r\n\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  filed a motion to alter or\r\n  amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  which was denied.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n1.&nbsp;Did the special referee commit an error of law in the\r\n  construction of the contract?\r\n2.&nbsp;Is there any evidence that reasonably supports the\r\n  decision of the special referee?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.â€Â  Sterling\r\n    Dev.

Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 314, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  West Oilâ€™s Right to Terminate the Contract at Will\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  avers the special referee erred in construing the Addition to the contract so\r\n  as to allow West Oil to terminate the contract at will.Â  Specifically, R&amp;B maintains the special referee\r\n  contravened several cardinal principles of contract law by interpreting the\r\n  Addition so as to render meaningless the primary contractual rights and duties\r\n  of the parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â \r\n  Unambiguous vs. Ambiguous Contract\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  first argues the special referee erred by failing to exclusively look to the\r\n  language of the clear and unambiguous contract in ascertaining the partiesâ€™\r\n  intent.Â  We disagree. \r\nIf a\r\n  contractâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable\r\n  interpretation, no construction is required and its language determines the\r\n  instrumentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Jordan v. Security Group, Inc.,\r\n  311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993); Blakeley at 72, 221\r\n  S.E.2d at 769.Â  â€œWhere an agreement is clear and capable of legal\r\n  interpretation, the courts only function is to interpret its lawful meaning,\r\n  discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give\r\n  effect to it.â€Â  Ellie, Inc. v.

Brady, 222 S.C. 242, 72 S.E.2d 193 (1952), the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n  It is fundamental that in the construction of the\r\n    language of a [contract], it is proper to read together the different\r\n    provisions therein dealing with the same subject matter, and where possible,\r\n    all the language used should be given a reasonable meaning.\r\n  Agreements should be liberally construed so as to give\r\n    them effect and carry out the intention of the parties.Â  In arriving at the\r\n    intention of the parties to a lease, the subject matter, the surrounding\r\n    circumstances, the situation of the parties, and the object in view and\r\n    intended to be accomplished by the parties at the time, are to be regarded, and\r\n    the lease construed as a whole.Â  Different provisions dealing with the same\r\n    subject matter are to be read together.\r\n\r\nId. at 246-47,\r\n  72 S.E.2d at 195.\r\nIncontrovertibly, the record evinces R&amp;Bâ€™s intent to include\r\n  the handwritten termination provision as an additional term to the contract.Â \r\n  R&amp;B was aware of and agreed upon the remedies available under the\r\n  handwritten termination provision.Â  The inclusion of the Addition was discussed\r\n  at the initial meeting between both parties, and the parties subsequently\r\n  agreed to incorporate the handwritten provision and acknowledged its inclusion\r\n  by separately initialing the Addition at the top of the Exclusive Agreement.Â  Luculently,\r\n  the record reflects R&amp;B intended to include the Addition as an essential term of the underlying\r\n  agreement.Â  Ergo, the special referee did not err in failing to find\r\n  otherwise.Â Â  \r\nC.Â \r\n  Parol Evidence\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  maintains the special referee erred by allowing parol evidence to aid in the\r\n  interpretation of the contract.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œWhere a contract is silent as to a particular matter, and\r\n  ambiguity thereby arises, parol evidence may be admitted to supply the\r\n  deficiency and establish the true intent.â€Â  Columbia East Assocs. v.

Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 593, 493 S.E.2d 875, 879\r\n  (Ct.

App. 1989) (â€œWhere the\r\n  contract is susceptible of more than one interpretation, the ambiguity will be\r\n  resolved against the party who prepared the contract.â€).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  R&amp;B correctly asserts any\r\n  ambiguity in a contract should be\r\n  resolved against the drafter, R&amp;B waived any claim regarding the construction\r\n  of ambiguities created by the additional termination provision.Â  In the\r\n  paragraph numbered ten in the Exclusive Agreement, â€œeach party hereby waives\r\n  the doctrine that an ambiguity should be construed and interpreted against the\r\n  party that drafted this Agreement.â€Â  The special referee did not err in construing\r\n  the Addition against R&amp;B. \r\nF.Â \r\n  Plain and Ordinary Meaning\r\nR&amp;B challenges the special referee erred by failing to\r\n  interpret the contract according to its plain and ordinary meaning.Â \r\n  Specifically, R&amp;B claims the special referee improperly construed the\r\n  Addition by equating the meaning of â€œterminationâ€ with the meaning of\r\n  â€œbreach.â€Â  We disagree. \r\nWhen the language of a contract is clear, explicit, and\r\n  unambiguous, the language of the contract alone determines the contractâ€™s force\r\n  and effect and the court must construe it according to its plain, ordinary, and\r\n  popular meaning.Â  Conner v. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 101, 328 S.E.2d 334,\r\n  336 (1985); Moser v. Gosnell, 334 S.C. 425, 430, 513 S.E.2d\r\n  123, 125 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\nContrary to R&amp;Bâ€™s contention, the language of the Addition\r\n  expressly and unambiguously sets forth what will occur in the event of contract\r\n  terminationâ€”not in the event of breach.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œterminationâ€ as â€œthe act of ending\r\n  something.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dict. (8th ed. 2004).Â  This was the same\r\n  operative term used in the handwritten provision expressly consented to by\r\n  R&amp;B.Â  R&amp;Bâ€™s express\r\n  consent to the Addition further reflects R&amp;Bâ€™s acknowledgment and\r\n  understanding of the terms therein.Â  Consequently, R&amp;B cannot claim the\r\n  special referee improperly construed â€œterminationâ€ as employed in the\r\n  Addition.Â  The special\r\n  referee did not err in interpreting the contract as terminated rather than\r\n  breached based upon the plain and ordinary meaning of the Additionâ€™s operative\r\n  language. \r\nG.Â \r\n  Good Sense Meaning\r\nR&amp;B\r\n  maintains the special referee erred in interpreting the contract according to\r\n  its â€œgood senseâ€ meaning.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\n  Common sense and good faith are the leading touchstones of\r\n    construction of the provisions of a contract; where one construction makes the\r\n    provisions unusual or extraordinary and another construction which is equally\r\n    consistent with the language employed, would make it reasonable, fair and just,\r\n    the latter construction must prevail. \r\n\r\nC.A.N.

App. 1997) (citing 3 Corbin on Contracts Â§ 548 (1960)).Â  Thus, the court did not err in finding\r\n  the Addition took priority over the pre-printed terms of the Exclusive\r\n  Agreement. \r\nII.Â  Evidentiary Record\r\nAlthough\r\n  the special refereeâ€™s order cites the witnessesâ€™ depositions rather than the\r\n  trial transcript, all facts recited in the order are consistent with testimony\r\n  given at trial and exhibits admitted into evidence.Â  The first four machines\r\n  were explicitly addressed by the written agreement.Â  R&amp;B placed machines in\r\n  thirteen additional stores without any additional written agreement.Â  Because\r\n  R&amp;B paid West Oil a $500 placement fee each time a machine was placed and\r\n  R&amp;B split the proceeds from the machines in the manner specified by the\r\n  contract, the court appropriately found the same terms of the written contract,\r\n  including the handwritten termination clause, applied to the additional\r\n  thirteen machines.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nâ€œCourts\r\n  are without authority to alter a contract by construction or to make new\r\n  contracts for the parties.â€Â  Gilstrap v. Culpepper, 283 S.C. 83, 86, 320\r\n  S.E.2d 445, 447 (1984).Â  Our duty is to interpret the contract according to the\r\n  intentions of the parties themselves â€œ. . . regardless of its wisdom or folly,\r\n  apparent unreasonableness, or failure to guard [the partiesâ€™] rights\r\n  carefully.â€Â  Id. (quoting Blakeley v. Rabon, 266 S.C. 68, 73, 221\r\n  S.E.2d 767, 769 (1976)).Â  Because the record illuminates the partiesâ€™ intent to\r\n  include the handwritten termination provision as an additional term to the\r\n  Exclusive Agreement, we hold the special referee properly construed the\r\n  Addition so as to allow West Oil to terminate the contract at will.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  rule the partiesâ€™ contract is ambiguous.Â  Concomitantly, parol evidence is\r\n  admissible to determine the partiesâ€™ intent.Â  The special referee correctly\r\n  held the contract is ambiguous and looked to parol evidence to construe the\r\n  contract.Â  There is ample evidence to support the refereeâ€™s decision that the\r\n  parties intended for either to be able to terminate their agreement.Â  The only\r\n  monetary consequence for termination was the prorated repayment of the $500\r\n  placement fee, which the court ordered West Oil to pay R&amp;B.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the special referee is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4390","title":"SGM-Moonglo v.

Sipe, of Columbia, for Respondent South Carolina Department of Revenue.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J.:Â  This is an appeal from an order of the Administrative Law Court (ALC)\r\n  granting SGM-Moonglo, Inc. (Moonglo) an off-premises beer and wine permit.Â  We\r\n  affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1975, Marjorie Smith sold a tract of real property to Virginia\r\n  Miller.Â  Smithâ€™s deed to Miller contained a restrictive covenant prohibiting\r\n  the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises. Â Moonglo purchased the\r\n  property in August 2006, and operates a truck stop on the property.Â  \r\nMoonglo applied to the South Carolina Department of Revenue (DOR)\r\n  for an off-premises beer and wine permit. Â After several area residents filed\r\n  protests, DOR denied the application. Â Moonglo then requested a contested case\r\n  hearing before the ALC. \r\nPrior to the hearing, the ALC granted Smithâ€™s motion to intervene\r\n  to enforce the restrictive covenant. Â After a hearing, the ALC granted Moonglo\r\n  an off-premises beer and wine permit, finding the property was a suitable\r\n  location and Moonglo met all applicable statutory requirements for obtaining\r\n  the permit. Â The ALC held it did not have jurisdiction to enforce a restrictive\r\n  covenant because its jurisdiction was limited to whether a proposed location\r\n  meets the criteria established by statute and case law. Â Smith appeals.[2]\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nSmith argues the ALC should have\r\n  considered the existence of the restrictive covenant as a factor in determining\r\n  whether to grant Moongloâ€™s petition for a beer and wine permit.Â  Smith contends\r\n  the truck stop is not a suitable location for a permit because the restrictive\r\n  covenant prohibits the sale of alcohol on the property. \r\nSection 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006)\r\n  sets forth the applicable standard of review when the court of appeals sits in review of a\r\n  decision by the ALC. â€œThe\r\n  review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order must be\r\n  confined to the record.â€[3] Â The court of appeals may reverse or modify the decision only if the\r\n  appellantâ€™s substantive rights have been prejudiced because the decision is\r\n  clearly erroneous in light of the reliable and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record, arbitrary or otherwise characterized by an abuse of discretion,\r\n  or affected by other error of law.[4] Â \r\nAn\r\n  administrative agency has only the powers conferred on it by law and must act\r\n  within the authority created for that purpose.[5]Â \r\n  Pursuant to section 61-4-520 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006), the ALC must\r\n  determine whether a proposed location is proper and suitable prior to granting\r\n  an off-premises beer and wine permit.Â  Restrictions in the chain of title of a\r\n  proposed location, however, are not a legitimate concern of the ALC in\r\n  determining whether the location is suitable.[6]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the ALC did not err in refusing to consider the existence of the\r\n  restrictive covenant.[7]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Smith also filed a separate civil action in Lexington County seeking an injunction to prohibit the sale of alcohol pursuant to the\r\n  restrictive covenant.Â  This action is pending.\r\n[3]Â  Â Id.\r\n[4]Â Â  Id.\r\n[5] Â Â Bazzle\r\n  v.

Evans appeals his criminal\r\n  conviction for possession of a stolen vehicle.Â  On appeal, Evans maintains the\r\n  trial court erred in overruling defense counselâ€™s objection to hearsay\r\n  testimony.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June\r\n  27, 2006, Evans was indicted for possession of a stolen vehicle in violation of\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-21-80 (1976).Â  At trial, William Human, Bobbie Hicks, and\r\n  Detective Steven Reeves presented testimony regarding the condition of the\r\n  stolen vehicle.Â  According to Human, â€œ[a]ll the molding was gone and wrecked .\r\n  . . [t]he steering column busted out. . . . I had stickers on it.Â  All those\r\n  was stripped off of it and all.â€Â  Human went on to testify that his tool box\r\n  was also missing and that Evansâ€™ wallet containing his driverâ€™s license was\r\n  found in the vehicle.Â  Following Humanâ€™s testimony, Hicks testified regarding\r\n  the condition of the vehicle, stating, â€œ[a]ll the siding is off of it.Â  The\r\n  column is gone out of it.â€ Â Hicks further stated â€œ[h]e had emblems all over the\r\n  window, they were gone.â€ Â Hicks also confirmed that a tool box and tools belonging\r\n  to Human were inside the vehicle prior to the theft.Â  \r\nFollowing the testimony of Human and Hicks, Detective Reeves\r\n  presented testimony regarding his investigation into the alleged theft. Â Reeves\r\n  testified he spoke with Human about damage to the vehicle and the details of\r\n  the crime. Â When questioned at trial regarding the vehicleâ€™s condition, Reeves\r\n  stated â€œ[t]he molding is removed.Â  Any emblems, Dodge or Dakota are removed\r\n  from the vehicle.â€Â  When Reeves attempted to reference a statement by Human, Evans\r\n  objected to Reevesâ€™ testimony on the ground of hearsay. Â The trial court\r\n  overruled Evansâ€™ objection and allowed the statements.Â  Reeves continued\r\n  his testimony, stating, â€œ[a]ccording to Mr. Human, when he and Miss Hicks\r\n  picked up the vehicle in Abbeville, the steering column was damaged and heâ€™s\r\n  had to replace that.Â  I didnâ€™t actually see that damage, but thatâ€™s some of the\r\n  other damage that Mr. Human had told me about.â€Â  Reeves further indicated that\r\n  a toolbox, which Human estimated was valued at over one thousand dollars, was\r\n  missing.Â  \r\nIn addition to the above-stated testimony, other evidence offered\r\n  to establish Evansâ€™ possession of the stolen vehicle was presented at trial.Â  Harley\r\n  Burdette, Rebecca Alexander, Catherine Johnson, and David Bolt all testified\r\n  that the vehicle was stolen and that Evans was in possession of the vehicle\r\n  following its theft.Â  Alexander and Burdette further testified that Evans\r\n  attempted to sell tools from the vehicle. Â It was also established that Evans\r\n  was arrested while driving the stolen vehicle. \r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Evans guilty of\r\n  possession of a stolen vehicle.Â  Evans was sentenced to ten years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The admissibility of evidence is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Gaster, 349\r\n  S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).Â Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility\r\n  of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the\r\n  commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State\r\n    v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEvans\r\n  contends the trial court erred by admitting hearsay testimony from Reeves\r\n  regarding damage to the stolen vehicle.Â  Evans further asserts that the\r\n  admission of this testimony caused prejudice, amounting to reversible error.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nImproper\r\n  admission of hearsay testimony constitutes reversible error only when the\r\n  admission causes prejudice.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336\r\n  S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  Generally, a conviction will not be set aside by the\r\n  appellate court where error by the trial court is insubstantial and does not\r\n  affect the result of the trial. Â State v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 499, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 363, 366 (2006).Â  Accordingly, where guilt has been conclusively proven\r\n  by competent evidence, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the\r\n  trial is harmless.Â  Id.; Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420\r\n  S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992); State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581,\r\n  584 (1989).Â  \r\nAssuming,\r\n  arguendo, that the testimony in question was improperly admitted by the trial\r\n  court, Evans has not demonstrated reversible error.Â  See Price,\r\n  368 S.C. at 499, 629 S.E.2d at 366.Â Â  Review of the record reveals Reevesâ€™\r\n  testimony regarding the condition of the vehicle was merely cumulative as both\r\n  Human and Hicks also testified to the damage sustained by the vehicle. Â See id. at 499-500, 629 S.E.2d at 366; see also State v. Haselden,\r\n  353 S.C. 190, 196-97, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448-49 (2003) (admission of improper\r\n  evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other\r\n  evidence); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862\r\n  (1993) (finding any error in the admission of testimony that is merely cumulative\r\n  is harmless).Â  Prior to Reevesâ€™ testimony, Human testified that: the vehicleâ€™s\r\n  molding was removed; the steering column was busted out; the stickers were stripped\r\n  from the exterior; and a toolbox was missing.Â  Hicks also similarly testified about\r\n  the molding, the steering column, and the emblems or stickers. \r\nFurther,\r\n  review of the record reveals other eyewitness testimony placing Evans in\r\n  possession of the stolen vehicle as well as testimony indicating Evans\r\n  attempted to sell tools from the vehicle; moreover, there is evidence that his\r\n  wallet and driverâ€™s license were found in the vehicle and that he was arrested\r\n  while driving the stolen vehicle.Â  Thus, despite the presence of the alleged\r\n  improper testimony regarding the condition of the vehicle, the verdict was\r\n  based on an abundance of competent evidence from which Evansâ€™ guilt was\r\n  properly established.Â  See State v. Lyles, 211 S.C. 334, 45\r\n  S.E.2d 181 (1947) (the possession of recently stolen property is an evidential\r\n  fact from which the possessorâ€™s guilt may be inferred); State v. Lee,\r\n  147 S.C. 480, 145 S.E. 285 (1928) (in a prosecution for receiving stolen goods,\r\n  guilty knowledge can be proved by showing a person was found in possession of\r\n  recently stolen goods); State v. Williams, 350 S.C. 172, 175-76, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 688, 690-91 (Ct. App. 2002) (possession of stolen vehicle was\r\n  circumstantial evidence that defendant knew the vehicle was stolen).Â \r\n  Therefore, the admission of Reevesâ€™ testimony, as merely cumulative,\r\n  insubstantial, and not affecting the result of the trial, was harmless.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find no reversible error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4392","title":"State v.

Â DW went back to the\r\n  bathroom a second time, this time with his friend JB.Â  When he entered the\r\n  bathroom this second time, he saw the same man that he encountered the first\r\n  time, standing at the sinks.Â  DW went to the first urinal and JB went to the\r\n  second.Â  When JB finished urinating, he left the urinal compartment and the\r\n  same man came up to that urinal.Â  Again the man glanced over, not at DWâ€™s face,\r\n  but at his privates.Â  DW again stated this made him feel uncomfortable.Â  He also\r\n  testified no one had ever made him feel the way this man did on that day.Â  DW\r\n  made an in-court identification of Caldwell as the man in the bathroom who\r\n  looked at his privates twice on the day in question.Â  \r\nJB,\r\n  who was thirteen years old at the time of trial and also swam on the Sugar\r\n  Creek team, likewise testified to events that occurred at the swim meet on June\r\n  23, 2005.Â  JB stated that he and DW entered the boysâ€™ bathroom on the pool deck\r\n  and saw an older man at the sink.Â  JB used the far urinal and DW used the first\r\n  one.Â  JB stated he finished urinating first and went to wash his hands.Â  As he\r\n  did so, the man went to the second urinal.Â  When JB finished washing his hands,\r\n  he observed the man at the second urinal turn his head to the side and look down\r\n  at DWâ€™s privates.Â  The man was not looking at DWâ€™s face.Â  JB and DW left the\r\n  bathroom and went straight to swim in their event.Â  JB made an in-court\r\n  identification of Caldwell as the man looking at DWâ€™s privates that day.Â  \r\nTwelve\r\n  year old QB also testified to an encounter with Caldwell while swimming on the\r\n  Sugar Creek team in June of 2005.Â  QB went alone to the bathroom for the boys\r\n  located on the pool deck.Â  There was a man in there at a urinal.Â  QB went to a\r\n  urinal and pulled down the front of his swimsuit to urinate.Â  As he did so, the\r\n  man looked down at QBâ€™s privates.Â  QB testified this made him feel â€œreally\r\n  awkward.â€Â  Like GT and DW, QB stated no one had ever made him feel the way this\r\n  man made him feel that day.Â  QB made an in-court identification of Caldwell as the man who looked at him in the bathroom.Â  QB further testified, after he\r\n  left the bathroom, he later saw the same man talking to DWâ€™s father outside the\r\n  bathroom.Â  \r\nMs.\r\n  Tate, one of the presidents of the Sugar Creek swim team, testified that at the\r\n  meet on June 23, 2005, she saw GT, whom she taught in fifth grade, and he\r\n  appeared to be â€œvery upset.â€Â  She asked GT what was wrong, and he told her\r\n  â€œthere was a man in the bathroom that was watching him go to the bathroom.â€Â \r\n  GTâ€™s mother came up to them as GT explained this to Ms. Tate.Â  The two women\r\n  sent GT up to the balcony as they walked over to the bathroom area.Â  GT pointed\r\n  out a man in that area to them. Â Ms. Tate then went to find someone who\r\n  could help with the situation while GTâ€™s mother stayed in the area to keep boys\r\n  out of the bathroom.Â  Ms. Tate found DWâ€™s father and led him back to the area\r\n  in front of the bathrooms, where the man was still standing.Â  DWâ€™s father\r\n  approached the man and tried to engage him in conversation.Â  Without objection,\r\n  Ms. Tate made an in-court identification of Caldwell as the man pointed out by\r\n  GT that day.Â  \r\nDWâ€™s\r\n  father testified that during the swim meet on June 23, 2005, Ms. Tate\r\n  approached him and told him what was occurring as she led him over to the bathroom\r\n  area.Â  After she pointed out Caldwell to him, DWâ€™s father walked up to the man\r\n  and introduced himself, attempting to engage the man in conversation.Â  The man\r\n  shook his hand, but never gave his name and apparently did not want to talk.Â \r\n  At some point, DWâ€™s father asked the man if he had a child on either of the\r\n  swim teams.Â  The man told him he had an eleven year-old boy on the Sugar Creek\r\n  team by the name of Trey Dowden.Â  When confronted with the fact that DWâ€™s\r\n  father knew most of the boys in that age group on the team, the man claimed\r\n  they were new to the team.Â  DWâ€™s father then asked the man what events his son\r\n  was swimming in, and when the man stated he did not know, he told the man he\r\n  would get a heat sheet that listed the children and the events.Â  When he\r\n  stepped back to get the heat sheet, he turned around and the man had left.Â \r\n  DWâ€™s father spotted the man and walked toward him, holding up the sheet and\r\n  telling him they could then look up his son.Â  The man exited the pool area and\r\n  DWâ€™s father followed him.Â  The man then ran away into a residential area and\r\n  DWâ€™s father pursued him for twenty or twenty-five minutes until some police\r\n  officers arrived and apprehended the man.Â  Without objection, DWâ€™s father\r\n  identified Caldwell as the man he had pursued that day.Â  DWâ€™s father further\r\n  testified there was no Trey Dowden in the eleven and twelve age group on either\r\n  of the swim teams.Â  \r\nDeputy\r\n  Chuck Porter arrived on the scene and spoke with Caldwell.Â  After the officer advised him of his Miranda[2] rights, Caldwell indicated he understood his rights and was willing to speak to\r\n  him without an attorney present.Â  Officer Porter than asked Caldwell if he\r\n  could tell him â€œwhatâ€™s going on.â€Â  Caldwell stated he had been confronted by\r\n  someone he believed to be a parent over at the pool and he had been â€œaccused of\r\n  doing something to one of the little boys in the restroom.â€Â  Officer Porter\r\n  asked, â€œWell, did you?â€Â  Caldwell replied that â€œ[h]e was there to look at the\r\n  boys, but hadnâ€™t touched anyone.â€Â  When asked if Caldwell said anything else,\r\n  the officer testified Caldwell â€œsaid he preferred to look at the younger\r\n  boys.â€Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court\r\n  err in refusing to grant Caldwellâ€™s motion for separate trials on each\r\n  indictment?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court\r\n  err in refusing to suppress the in-court identification by the minors DW and\r\n  JB?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court\r\n  err in allowing testimony of the alleged statements made by the defendant to\r\n  Officer Porter?\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court\r\n  err in allowing the victims to testify how they felt when Caldwell looked at\r\n  them?\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court\r\n  err in refusing to direct a verdict in favor of Caldwell? \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Motion for Separate Trials\r\nOn appeal, Caldwell contends the trial court erred in refusing\r\n  to grant his motion for separate trials on each of the indictments.Â  He\r\n  contends the joint trial on the indictments was extremely prejudicial such that\r\n  the trial court committed error in failing to sever them. We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court\r\n  and the courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 652, 572 S.E.2d 267, 272 (2002). Â Criminal\r\n  charges can be tried together where they (1) arise out of a single chain of\r\n  circumstances, (2) are proved by the same evidence, (3) are of the same general\r\n  nature, and (4) no real right of the defendant has been prejudiced.Â  State\r\n    v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 164, 478 S.E.2d 260, 265 (1996).Â  Where the\r\n  offenses charged in separate indictments are of the same general nature\r\n  involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and character,\r\n  the trial judge has the discretionary power to order the indictments tried\r\n  together if the defendantâ€™s substantive rights would not be prejudiced.Â  State\r\n    v. Cutro, 365 S.C. 366, 374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2005); State v. Smith,\r\n  322 S.C. 107, 109, 470 S.E.2d 364, 365 (1996).Â  \r\nOffenses\r\n  are considered to be of the same general nature where they are interconnected.Â  State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 350, 573 S.E.2d 856, 860 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  Conversely, offenses which are of the same nature, but which do not\r\n  arise out of a single chain of circumstances and are not provable by the same\r\n  evidence may not properly be tried together.Â  Id.\r\nCaldwell does not\r\n  dispute that the indictments are of a similar nature and arise out of a single\r\n  chain of circumstances.Â  He contends, however, that the individual charges\r\n  cannot be proven with the same evidence, as each charge required separate\r\n  evidence from the others. He further asserts that a single trial of all three\r\n  charges resulted in extreme prejudice inasmuch as he was unable to sequester the witnesses and there was an unfair\r\n  collective impact of emotional testimony of the several victims.Â  We disagree.\r\nAll three charges\r\n  here arise out of a single chain of circumstances, occurring on the same\r\n  afternoon, during the same event, and at the same place.Â  While the alleged\r\n  crimes involved pertained to three separate children necessitating some\r\n  individual evidence as to each of the charges, much of the evidence produced at\r\n  trial pertained to each of the separate charges.Â  Thus, the separate offenses\r\n  are proved by the same evidence.Â  We find the fact that some additional\r\n  evidence from the individual victims may be necessary to prove the individual\r\n  crimes is not fatal to the joinder of the charges.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  likewise do not find compelling Caldwellâ€™s argument regarding the sequestering\r\n  of witnesses.Â  A party is not entitled to the sequestration of witnesses as a\r\n  matter of right. Â State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 375, 509 S.E.2d 819,\r\n  827 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Whether or not witnesses are sequestered is a matter within\r\n  the discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 46,\r\n  282 S.E.2d 838, 844 (1981), superseded in part by State v. Gilchrist,\r\n  342 S.C. 369, 536 S.E.2d 868 (2000).Â  Further, the mere opportunity for the\r\n  Stateâ€™s witnesses to compare testimony is insufficient to compel sequestration.Â  Id. Â Thus, it is not clear that, had Caldwell been tried separately on\r\n  each charge, he would have been entitled to sequester the witnesses.Â  In any\r\n  event, we find no evidence of record that his inability to sequester the\r\n  witnesses unduly prejudiced his case.\r\nFinally,\r\n  we find meritless Caldwellâ€™s assertion that the collective emotional testimony\r\n  of the child victims unduly prejudiced him.Â  Caldwell does not argue on appeal\r\n  that the testimony of the individual victims would be inadmissible at the other\r\n  trials if he were to be tried separately on each indictment.Â  See Rule\r\n  404(b), SCRE; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923) (evidence\r\n  of other crimes may be admissible when it tends to establish (1) motive; (2)\r\n  intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan\r\n  embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that\r\n  proof of one tends to establish the proof of the other; or (5) the identity of\r\n  the person charged with the present crime).Â  Thus, Caldwell might still be\r\n  faced with the childrenâ€™s â€œcollectiveâ€ testimony were he to be tried separately\r\n  on each charge.Â  At any rate, we do not believe the testimony of the child\r\n  victims in this case can be accurately described as emotional.Â  We simply find\r\n  no prejudice to Caldwell in the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion to sever.\r\nII.Â \r\n  In-court Identifications by DW and JB\r\nAlthough\r\n  Caldwell objected to the in-court identification by all three of the child\r\n  victims and the child witness at trial, on appeal he only challenges the\r\n  identifications by victim DW and witness JB.Â  We find no error.\r\nAt\r\n  the request of defense counsel, the court held a Neil v. Biggers[3] hearing to determine the admissibility of the identification of Caldwell by the child victims and witness.Â  Deputy Ken Hinkle testified in the hearing that\r\n  he worked for the sheriffâ€™s office and was assigned as the community patrol\r\n  officer for Sugar Creek.Â  On the day of the swim meet, he met with GT, JB, DW,\r\n  and QB in his office at the clubhouse.Â  He interviewed each boy separately, in\r\n  the presence of their parents.Â  The boys did not give detailed descriptions of\r\n  the man in the bathroom, but indicated it was a white male and was â€œthe person\r\n  that [DWâ€™s father] chased.â€Â  The following day, Deputy Hinkle met with three of\r\n  the boys.Â  At that time he obtained a written statement from GT, DW, and JB.Â \r\n  Deputy Hinkle wrote their statements as the boys told him what had occurred.Â \r\n  However, the deputy acknowledged that the last sentence of each of the boysâ€™\r\n  statements was not told to him by the boys, but was written in the statements\r\n  by the deputy.Â  The last sentence in each statement said, â€œI now know the man\r\n  to be William Frank Caldwell.â€Â  When asked why he included that in the\r\n  statements, Deputy Hinkle responded that â€œ[i]t was the same person . . . they\r\n  saw in the bathroom . . . they pointed out to [DWâ€™s father], to the person that\r\n  he chased, to the person that we took custody of,â€ and he â€œsimply condensed it\r\n  into a name.â€Â  Deputy Hinkle took a statement from DWâ€™s father, who identified\r\n  the individual he chased.Â  When talking to the boys, they referred to the\r\n  person in question as the man DWâ€™s father chased.Â  The deputy denied ever\r\n  showing the boys a picture or a lineup of Caldwell or ever bringing Caldwell in front of the boys for them to make an identification.Â  Deputy Hinkle did not\r\n  know whether the three boys knew Caldwellâ€™s name before he wrote it in their\r\n  statements.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court, while acknowledging there was a â€œsuggestive statement made at the\r\n  end of the written statements as to the name identity of the individual,â€ found\r\n  the identification testimony was admissible.Â  The court reflected the basis of\r\n  the identification by the boys was tied together and, while noting it was\r\n  subject to cross-examination and the exploration of credibility before the\r\n  jury, the court determined the procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive and\r\n  was reliable based upon all the evidence.Â  \r\nA\r\n  criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification\r\n  procedure which is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken\r\n  identification. Â State v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 81, 600 S.E.2d 523, 526\r\n  (2004). Â An in-court identification of an\r\n  accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure\r\n  created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  Id.Â  Generally, a trial court must hold an in camera hearing when the State offers a\r\n  witness whose testimony identifies the defendant as the person who committed\r\n  the crime, and the defendant challenges the in-court identification as being\r\n  tainted by a previous, illegal identification or confrontation.Â  State v.\r\n    Ramsey, 345 S.C. 607, 613, 550 S.E.2d 294, 297 (2001).[4] Â The purpose of the in camera hearing is to determine whether the in-court\r\n  identification was of independent origin or was the tainted product of the\r\n  circumstances surrounding the prior, out-of-court identification.Â  State v.\r\n    Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 594, 611 S.E.2d 283, 287 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find no evidence the in-court identifications of Caldwell by DW and JB were in\r\n  any way tainted by the deputy supplying Caldwellâ€™s name to them.Â  Although we\r\n  do not condone law enforcement including information in a statement that was\r\n  not specifically provided by the witness, we simply find no indication that\r\n  placing a name with the suspect in any way tainted the in-court identifications\r\n  by the two boys such that their visual identification of the defendant in court\r\n  was no longer of independent origin, or that supplying the name created a very\r\n  substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\r\nIII.Â  Admission of Statements\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Caldwell raises two grounds for error in the admission of his alleged\r\n  statements to Officer Porter.Â  He first contends the statement that he\r\n  preferred to look at younger boys was inadmissible character evidence.Â  He\r\n  further asserts no alleged statements made by him to the officer were\r\n  admissible because the State failed to properly disclose the substance of the\r\n  statements to him pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nThe\r\n  court held a Jackson v. Denno[5] hearing on the admissibility of statements made by Caldwell to Officer Porter.Â \r\n  During the hearing, the officer testified that when he asked Caldwell what was\r\n  going on, Caldwell made the statement he had been confronted outside the\r\n  restroom and accused of doing something to the little boys inside the\r\n  bathroom.Â  When asked if he had, Caldwell responded that â€œhe was there looking\r\n  at the boys, but he hadnâ€™t touched anyone.â€Â  Officer Porter next asked Caldwell if he was gay, to which Caldwell stated that he was, but he preferred younger\r\n  men.Â  When questioned about the whereabouts of his report on the matter,\r\n  Officer Porter stated he prepared it and turned it in, but it was apparently\r\n  lost.Â  He subsequently prepared a secondary report dated April 9, 2006 from\r\n  memory after the original report could not be located.Â  Caldwell testified\r\n  during the hearing and denied making these statements to Officer Porter.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the hearing, the defense objected to the admission of the statements based on\r\n  their relevance and the prejudicial effect, as well as the Stateâ€™s failure to\r\n  comply with their discovery request.Â  The trial court denied the motion to\r\n  suppress based on defenseâ€™s discovery violation argument.Â  It further ruled the\r\n  statement that Caldwell was gay was not relevant, and it would not allow any\r\n  comment as to Caldwellâ€™s sexual orientation.Â  It determined, however, that the\r\n  other statements were relevant and admissible.Â  \r\nA.Â  Improper Character\r\n  Evidence\r\nWe\r\n  first question whether Caldwellâ€™s assertion regarding improper character\r\n  evidence is properly preserved for our review.Â  Caldwell maintains on appeal\r\n  the trial court erred in allowing testimony that he preferred to look at\r\n  younger boys into evidence as such testimony is improper character evidence under\r\n  Rule 404, SCRE, as well as the case of State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 501\r\n  S.E.2d 716 (1998).Â  However, at trial defense counsel clearly objected to the\r\n  evidence on the basis that any probative value was outweighed by the\r\n  prejudicial effect.Â  Counsel never mentioned either Rule 404 or the Nelson case.Â  While he did quickly reference character when he argued that the State\r\n  was attempting â€œto evoke strong emotion against somebody whose character may or\r\n  may not be into evidence,â€ this argument appears to have been made in\r\n  conjunction with his assertion that the statement regarding his sexual\r\n  orientation was inadmissible.Â  The trial court ultimately agreed with the\r\n  defense on the sexual orientation issue, and the alleged statement that Caldwell was gay was not admitted into evidence.Â  Because the argument raised on appeal\r\n  does not appear to have been specifically raised below, it may not be preserved\r\n  on appeal.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d\r\n  691, 694 (2003) (noting â€œ[a] party need not use the exact name of a legal\r\n  doctrine in order to preserve it, but it must be clear that the argument has\r\n  been presented on that groundâ€); State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196,\r\n  577 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2003) (holding party may not argue one ground at trial and\r\n  another on appeal; where appellant did\r\n  not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal, that it was\r\n  improper character evidence, but objected only on the basis of relevancy, issue\r\n  was not preserved for review).\r\nAssuming\r\n  arguendo the argument as to character evidence is properly preserved, we\r\n  nonetheless find no error.Â  Generally, â€œ[e]vidence of a personâ€™s character or a\r\n  trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in\r\n  conformity therewith on a particular occasion.â€Â  Rule 404(a), SCRE.Â  In State\r\n    v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 501 S.E.2d 716\r\n  (1998), the appellant was convicted at trial of four counts of first degree CSC\r\n  with a minor and four counts of lewd act on a child. Â Nelson made post-arrest\r\n  statements to police indicating he was uncomfortable around adult women and\r\n  that he had fantasies about children.Â  The trial judge overruled Nelsonâ€™s\r\n  objection to testimony concerning Nelsonâ€™s fantasies or likes or dislikes of\r\n  females.Â  On appeal from this courtâ€™s affirmance of Nelsonâ€™s convictions, the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding the trial court erred in\r\n  allowing the jury to hear those statements, as Nelsonâ€™s â€œgeneral sexual\r\n  attitudes were not relevant or material to the crime charged because they were\r\n  admitted to show characterâ€.Â  Id. at 16, 501 S.E.2d at 724.\r\nSubsequent\r\n  to the Nelson decision, this court addressed the issue of whether\r\n  testimony concerning a defendantâ€™s statement to police indicating he had a\r\n  problem with his sexual desires constituted improper character evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Tufts, 355 S.C. 493, 585 S.E.2d 523 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (June 24, 2004).Â  In Tufts, the appellant was charged with and convicted\r\n  of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree in regard to an encounter with a\r\n  patient at Aiken Regional Medical Center.Â  While being interviewed by the\r\n  police, Tufts told a detective he had been arrested and charged in a sexual\r\n  matter in Augusta, Georgia in 1995 while he worked at the University Hospital.Â  When the detective told Tufts it sounded like he may have a problem, Tufts stated\r\n  that he knew he had a problem with his sexual desires.Â  Id. at 495, 585\r\n  S.E.2d at 524.Â  Following an in camera hearing on the matter, the trial court\r\n  determined the alleged statement concerning Tuftsâ€™s prior charge in Georgia was inadmissible.Â  However, it ruled that the portion of the conversation\r\n  concerning Tuftsâ€™s knowledge that he had a problem with his sexual desires\r\n  could be construed as a confession and was therefore admissible.Â  Id. at 496, 585 S.E.2d at 524.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Tufts asserted the detectiveâ€™s testimony constituted improper character\r\n  evidence, relying primarily on Nelson.Â  While acknowledging the\r\n  statement in question was similar to the type of evidence presented in Nelson which was disallowed by the court, we found the Nelson decision\r\n  distinguishable and affirmed Tuftsâ€™s conviction.Â  First, we noted in Nelson that, aside from the statements made by Nelson that he was uncomfortable around\r\n  adult women and had fantasies about children, the State sought to admit a number\r\n  of toys, tapes of childrenâ€™s shows, storybooks, and photographs of young\r\n  children.Â  The State presented expert testimony that pedophiles often maintain\r\n  a large stash of childlike items.Â  Over Nelsonâ€™s objection, the trial court ruled\r\n  â€œthe evidence was probative not of a â€˜character issueâ€™ but of a â€˜personality\r\n  characteristic,â€™ i.e., that the defendant was a pedophile.â€Â  Id. at\r\n  497-98, 585 S.E.2d at 525.Â  In Tufts, our court concluded the statements\r\n  made by Tufts were not introduced to show his bad character, but were admitted\r\n  as a confession to the crime with which he was charged.Â  We stated:\r\n\r\n\tIn Nelson,\r\n  the offered evidence and the defendantâ€™s statements were relevant only to prove\r\n  that the defendant was a pedophile.Â  The fact that the defendant was a\r\n  pedophile spoke only to his propensity to commit the charged offense, and\r\n  evidence thereof was thus inadmissible.Â  In the present case, however, Tuftsâ€™s\r\n  statements were not admitted to show his character;Â  instead, they were\r\n  admitted as a confession to the specific crime charged.\r\n\r\nId. at 498, 585 S.E.2d at 526.\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  Caldwellâ€™s statements that he â€œwas there to look at the boys, but hadnâ€™t\r\n  touched anyoneâ€ and that he â€œpreferred to look at the younger boysâ€ were not\r\n  introduced to show his bad character, but were intended to convey to Officer\r\n  Porter that he had committed the offenses with which he was subsequently\r\n  charged, i.e. being a peeping tom.Â  Accordingly, as in Tufts, the\r\n  statements were properly admitted as a confession to the charged crimes.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  any rate, we find any error in the admission of this evidence to be harmless in\r\n  light of the overwhelming evidence showing Caldwell entered and/or remained in\r\n  the boysâ€™ bathroom for extended periods of time, furtively viewing the privates\r\n  of these young boys.Â  See State v. Brown 344 S.C. 70, 74,\r\n  543 S.E.2d 552, 555 (S.C. 2001) (the erroneous admission of character\r\n  evidence is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if its impact is minimal in the context\r\n  of the entire record).\r\nB.Â  Failure to Comply with\r\n  Discovery\r\nCaldwell further asserts the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  the alleged statements made to Officer Porter because the State violated Rule\r\n  5(a)(3), SCRCrimP by failing to properly disclose the substance of the alleged\r\n  statements in a timely manner.Â  We find no error.\r\nâ€œUpon\r\n  request by a defendant, the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect\r\n  and copy or photograph:Â  . . .Â  the substance of any oral statement which the\r\n  prosecution intends to offer in evidence at the trial made by the defendant\r\n  whether before or after arrest in response to interrogation by any person then\r\n  known to the defendant to be a prosecution agent.â€Â  Rule 5(a)(1)(A), SCRCrimP.Â \r\n  â€œThe prosecution shall respond to the defendantâ€™s request for disclosure no\r\n  later then thirty (30) days after the request is made, or within such other\r\n  time as may be ordered by the court.â€Â  Rule 5(a)(3), SCRCrimP.Â  A Rule 5\r\n  violation is not reversible unless prejudice is shown.Â  State v. Landon,\r\n  370 S.C. 103, 108, 634 S.E.2d 660, 663 (2006).\r\nWe\r\n  find no prejudice to Caldwell such as would entitle him to suppression of the\r\n  statements.Â  The statements, as referred to in Officer Porterâ€™s supplemental\r\n  report, were admittedly turned over to the defense in April 2006.Â  Caldwell\r\n  contends the Stateâ€™s failure to disclose the alleged statements until that time\r\n  prejudiced him because, after that point, the opportunity afforded to him to\r\n  plead to only a single indictment had passed.Â  However, a defendant has no\r\n  constitutional right to plea bargain. Â State v. Chisolm, 312 S.C. 235,\r\n  237, 439 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1994).Â  Thus, Caldwell was not prejudiced by the\r\n  delayed disclosure.Â  See Chisolm, 312 S.C. at 237-38, 439 S.E.2d\r\n  at 851-52 (holding, even though assistant solicitor acted inappropriately by communicating\r\n  with a party known to be represented by counsel and by surreptitiously tape\r\n  recording the conversation, assertion appellant was prejudiced as evidenced by\r\n  the absence of plea negotiations was insufficient inasmuch as a defendant has\r\n  no constitutional right to plea bargain).\r\nIV.Â  Admission of Testimony\r\n  on How the Victims Felt\r\nCaldwell\r\n  next asserts the trial court erred in allowing the victims to testify to how it\r\n  made them feel when he looked at them in the bathroom, and whether anyone had\r\n  ever made them feel that way before.Â  He argues this line of questioning was\r\n  irrelevant and appealed to the passion and sympathy of the jury such that the\r\n  prejudice to him outweighed any probative value.Â  We disagree.\r\nFor\r\n  evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant.Â  Rule 402, SCRE. Â Relevant\r\n  evidence is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œEvidence is\r\n  relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter in\r\n  issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears, and it is not required that\r\n  the inference sought should necessarily follow from the fact proved.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 126-27, 606 S.E.2d 508, 513 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n  â€œEvidence is admissible if â€˜logically relevantâ€™ to establish a material fact or\r\n  element of the crime; it need not be â€˜necessaryâ€™ to the Stateâ€™s case in order\r\n  to be admitted.â€Â  Id. at 127, 606 S.E.2d at 513.Â  Relevant evidence may\r\n  be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice. Â Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 210,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 262, 266 (2006). Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it has\r\n  an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, such as an\r\n  emotional one.Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 547, 552 S.E.2d 300,\r\n  311 (2001).Â  A trial courtâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value\r\n  and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional\r\n  circumstances.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 81, 606 S.E.2d 215,\r\n  219 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Determination of relevancy is largely within the\r\n  discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.Â  Sweat, 362 S.C. at 127, 606 S.E.2d at 513.\r\nThe\r\n  â€œpeeping tomâ€ statutory section with which Caldwell was charged provides, in\r\n  part, that a peeping tom includes one whose conduct is such that it â€œtends to\r\n  invade the privacy of others.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-470(A) (2003).[6]Â \r\n  While the determination of whether the conduct of Caldwell tended to invade the\r\n  privacy of the three young victims is ultimately for the jury, we believe the\r\n  specific testimony in question, although maybe not necessary to the Stateâ€™s\r\n  case, is logically relevant to the establishment of that element of the crime.Â \r\n  Further, the record shows the trial court limited the State to eliciting a\r\n  concise statement from the victims on the privacy issue to keep any prejudice to\r\n  a minimum, and the State did not stray beyond those parameters.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we do not believe the probative value of the testimony is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  \r\nV.Â  Denial of Motion for\r\n  Directed Verdict\r\nFinally,\r\n  Caldwell raises three grounds on appeal as to why the trial court erred in\r\n  denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  He maintains the State failed to\r\n  establish that (1) he was on the premises of another, (2) he spied upon or\r\n  invaded the privacy of another, or (3) that the looks cast by him arose to the\r\n  level required by the peeping tom statute.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, an appellate court\r\n  must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v.\r\n    Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  The trial court, in\r\n  a directed verdict motion, is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not with its weight.Â  State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 136,\r\n  620 S.E.2d 737, 743 (2005).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when\r\n  the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v.\r\n    McCombs, 368 S.C. 489, 493, 629 S.E.2d 361, 362-63 (2006).Â  If there is any\r\n  direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to\r\n  prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to\r\n  the jury. Â Id. at 493, 629 S.E.2d at 363.Â  \r\nCaldwell was charged with violating our peeping tom statute.Â \r\n  Specifically, the indictments charged that Caldwell did, â€œunlawfully eavesdrop\r\n  or peep on or about the premises of the Sugar Creek Homeowners Association, or\r\n  did go upon the premises of the Sugar Creek Homeowners Association, for the\r\n  purpose of becoming an eavesdropper or a Peeping Tom invading the privacy of\r\n  [the victims].â€Â  The peeping tom statute provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  unlawful for a person to be an eavesdropper or a peeping tom on or about the\r\n  premises of another or to go upon the premises of another for the purpose of\r\n  becoming an eavesdropper or a peeping tom. The term â€œpeeping tomâ€, as used in\r\n  this section, is defined as a person who peeps through windows, doors, or other\r\n  like places, on or about the premises of another, for the purpose of spying\r\n  upon or invading the privacy of the persons spied upon and any other conduct of\r\n  a similar nature, that tends to invade the privacy of others.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Section\r\n  16-17-470(A) (2003). \r\nA.Â  Premises of Another\r\nCaldwell first contends the State failed to meet its burden of\r\n  showing he was â€œon or about the premises of another.â€Â  He asserts the evidence\r\n  shows he was clearly on public property and that inherent in the statute is the\r\n  requirement that the accusedâ€™s presence be unlawful on the premises.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  record shows, although the swim meet was open to the public, the pool area is\r\n  on private property.Â  Further, the State presented evidence that it was\r\n  uncommon for people who are not family members or friends of the child\r\n  participants to attend these swim meets.Â  \r\nCaldwell relies primarily on this courtâ€™s opinion in Herald\r\n  Publâ€™g Co. v. Barnwell, 291 S.C. 4, 351 S.E.2d 878 (Ct. App. 1986). Â There,\r\n  our court held the peeping\r\n  tom/eavesdropping statute was inapplicable to the conduct of newspaper\r\n  reporters who sought to overhear proceedings of city council while it was in\r\n  executive session. Â We find Herald Publâ€™g Co. to be distinguishable.Â \r\n  That was a civil case wherein newspaper publishers brought an action against\r\n  members of city council alleging that council violated the open-meeting\r\n  requirement of the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act.Â  Council denied\r\n  the alleged violations and counterclaimed, alleging that newspapers had\r\n  violated the Act by eavesdropping on the executive session.Â  This court\r\n  affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of injunctive relief to city council, noting\r\n  â€œthere is no evidence that the reporters did anything to enable them to\r\n  overhear what was going on in the executive session other than to wait in the\r\n  place provided as a waiting room for reporters and other members of the public.â€Â \r\n  Because the reporters were on public property, in a place provided to them and\r\n  other members of the public at the time of the alleged actions, they were not â€œon\r\n  or about the premises of another.â€Â  Id. at 12-13, 351 S.E.2d at 883.Â \r\n  Here, Caldwell clearly was not on public property.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  do not read into the statute, as does Caldwell, that an accused must be\r\n  unlawfully upon the premises prior to the objectionable conduct for the statute\r\n  to apply.Â  There is no such language in the statute.Â  Certainly there are those\r\n  situations where one might be lawfully upon the premises of another and still\r\n  invade the privacy of another by peeping in violation of the statute.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the State has presented evidence Caldwell was on private property\r\n  and that he was peeping â€œon or about the premises of another.â€ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nB.Â  Spying upon or Invading\r\n  the Privacy of Another\r\nNext\r\n  Caldwell maintains the State failed to present evidence that he either spied\r\n  upon or invaded the privacy of another.Â  He argues there is no evidence he\r\n  spied, because the statute requires one to look â€œthrough windows, doors, or\r\n  other like places, on or about the premises of anotherâ€ in order to be spying.Â \r\n  He further asserts there is no evidence he invaded the privacy of another\r\n  because there could be no expectation of privacy in the unpartitioned urinals\r\n  in the Sugar Creek bathroom.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst,\r\n  the statute does not limit the proscribed behavior of a peeping tom to one who\r\n  looks â€œthrough windows, doors, or other like places,â€ but also prohibits â€œany\r\n  other conduct of a similar nature, that tends to invade the privacy of others.â€Â \r\n  We conclude, while there is no evidence Caldwell looked â€œthroughâ€ any\r\n  windows, doors, or the such, there is evidence of â€œother conduct of a\r\n    similar nature,â€ tending to invade the privacy of others.[7]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the State did present evidence Caldwell was on the premises of\r\n  another for the purpose of spying upon another. \r\nFurther,\r\n  while Caldwell correctly points out that there was no physical barrier, such as\r\n  a partition, to afford the young boys complete privacy, we find, under\r\n  the facts of this case, the victims did in fact have an expectation of privacy\r\n  such that there is evidence Caldwell was on the premises of another for the\r\n  purpose of invading that privacy.Â  The evidence shows the children were\r\n  participating in a swim meet on private property.Â  The young, male victims used the boysâ€™ bathroom on the pool deck that was provided\r\n  â€œfor the kids,â€ while another bathroom for the adults was located in the clubhouse.Â \r\n  While in the boysâ€™ bathroom, the three victims encountered Caldwell at least\r\n  five separate times.Â  The record shows Caldwell, on more than one occasion, was\r\n  either in another area of the bathroom or appeared to be exiting the bathroom\r\n  when he purposely came back to one of the urinals just as a victim went to use\r\n  the other urinal.Â  There is evidence that on each occasion Caldwell\r\n  specifically looked directly at the boysâ€™ privates and, on at least one\r\n  occasion, bent over and spit in the urinal and looked sideways in order to get\r\n  a better look at the privates of one of the children.Â  We find there is more\r\n  than sufficient evidence Caldwell invaded the privacy of his three young\r\n  victims, inasmuch as children should reasonably expect a certain degree of\r\n  privacy when urinating in a bathroom that, when respected, would protect them\r\n  from peering adults.\r\nC.Â  Looks Cast by Appellant\r\nFinally,\r\n  Caldwell argues he was entitled to a directed verdict because the alleged\r\n  looks cast by him did not arise to the level required by South Carolina Code\r\n  Ann. Section 16-17-470(D)(3) (2003), which provides â€œAs used in this section .\r\n  . . â€˜Viewâ€™ means the intentional looking upon of another person for more than a\r\n  brief period of time, in other than a casual or cursory manner . . . .â€Â  As\r\n  previously noted, subsection (D) of this statute clearly refers to the terms\r\n  used in subsection (B) of the statute which prohibits the crime of voyeurism.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-470(B) and (D) (2003).Â  Subsection (A) of the statute\r\n  prohibits one from â€œpeep[ing] through windows, doors, or other like places . .\r\n  . and any other conduct of a similar nature, that tends to invade the privacy\r\n  of others.â€Â  S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 16-17-470(A) (2003).Â  â€œPeepâ€ has been defined\r\n  alternatively as â€œto look cautiously or slyly; a brief look: glance; a furtive\r\n  look.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 867 (9th ed. 1990).Â  There is\r\n  clearly evidence that Caldwell peeped at each of the young victimsâ€™ privates.Â \r\n  Finally, even if we were to assume arguendo subsection (D) of the statute\r\n  applied, we find there is evidence Caldwell did intentionally look at the\r\n  privates of the three young victims for more than just a brief period of time\r\n  in other than a casual or cursory manner.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing reasons, we find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to sever the trials, denial of\r\n  Caldwellâ€™s motion to suppress the two boysâ€™ in-court identifications, admission\r\n  of alleged statements made by Caldwell, admission of testimony regarding how\r\n  Caldwellâ€™s actions made the victims feel, and denial of Caldwellâ€™s motion for\r\n  directed verdict. Accordingly, Caldwellâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  JJ., concurs.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  JJ., concurs in result.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:&nbsp; I concur in result but write separately as I\r\n  believe it was error to admit the victimsâ€™ testimony concerning how they felt\r\n  when Caldwell stared at their genitals.Â  As the defense points out, the\r\n  presence or absence of a victimâ€™s â€œfeelingsâ€ is irrelevant under the â€œpeeping\r\n  tom statuteâ€ because a victimâ€™s emotional response has no bearing on any\r\n  element of the crime.Â  Indeed, in many such prosecutions, the victim is unaware\r\n  of the peeping tom's presence and the invasion of privacy.Â  I concur in result\r\n  as this error was harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of guilt.Â  State\r\n    v. Garner, 304 S.C. 220, 222, 403 S.E.2d 631, 632 (1991) (holding\r\n  improperly admitted evidence was harmless error given the overwhelming evidence\r\n  of guilt).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2]Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3]Neil v. Biggers,\r\n  409 U.S. 188 (1972).\r\n[4]Although the State opposed a Neil v. Biggers hearing at the trial level arguing it was unnecessary where the in-court\r\n  identification forms the first identification the witness made, it does not so\r\n  argue on appeal.Â  Because we find no error in the admission of the in-court\r\n  identifications, we express no opinion on whether such a hearing was required\r\n  under the circumstances.Â  See State v. Lewis, 363 S.C. 37, 43, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 515, 518 (2005) (holding Neil v. Biggers does not apply to a\r\n  first-time in-court identification because the judge is present and can\r\n  adequately address relevant problems; the jury is physically present to witness\r\n  the identification, rather than merely hearing testimony about it; and\r\n  cross-examination offers defendants an adequate safeguard or remedy against\r\n  suggestive examinations); but cf. State v. Simmons, 308\r\n  S.C. 80, 82-83, 417 S.E.2d 92, 93 (1992), (holding in camera hearing was needed\r\n  to determine whether the in-court identification was of independent origin or\r\n  was the tainted product of the circumstances surrounding a bond hearing where a\r\n  witness saw a suspect at a bond hearing prior to his in-court identification of\r\n  the suspect and the witness may have gotten a â€œfixâ€ on the suspect at the bond\r\n  hearing). \r\n[5]Jackson v.\r\n  Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n[6]Caldwell cites to\r\n  language in the statute defining the phrase â€œ[p]lace where a person would have\r\n  a reasonable expectation of privacyâ€ in support of his argument this testimony\r\n  was not relevant.Â  However, this phrase applies to the section of the statute\r\n  prohibiting the crime of voyeurism and is not found in the section prohibiting\r\n  eavesdropping and peeping.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-470(A), (B), and (D) (2003).\r\n[7]It should be noted, while Caldwell challenged the\r\n  constitutionality of the statute at trial, in particular the phrase â€œother\r\n  conduct of a similar nature, that tends to invade the privacy of others,â€ as\r\n  being overly broad, he does not raise that issue on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4393","title":"Stradford v.

[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nJane\r\n  Doe Wilson (Child) was born to Mother and Father on March 14, 2004.Â  Mother and\r\n  Father never married,[2]Â \r\n  and since birth, Child has lived with Mother, Motherâ€™s sister, Childâ€™s\r\n  half-sister, and Childâ€™s maternal grandmother in the grandmotherâ€™s home.Â \r\n  Father lives in the same town with his mother in her home.Â  \r\nIn April 2005, Father filed a complaint seeking to establish his\r\n  paternity and requesting liberal visitation.Â  Father thereafter amended his\r\n  complaint seeking to change Childâ€™s name to Stradford.Â  In October 2005, the\r\n  parties informed the court they had reached an agreement on all issues, except\r\n  changing Childâ€™s name.Â  Accordingly, the family court entered an order finding\r\n  Father was Childâ€™s biological father, ordering the birth certificate to reflect\r\n  Fatherâ€™s paternity, and establishing a visitation schedule; however, the court continued\r\n  Fatherâ€™s request to change Childâ€™s name pending the appointment of a guardian\r\n  ad litem (GAL). \r\nAt the March 13, 2007 trial, Father testified he wanted Child to\r\n  have his surname because he planned on supporting her the rest of his life.Â \r\n  The paternal grandmother also testified Child should have Fatherâ€™s surname\r\n  because â€œ[w]e have a family tradition, a long family tradition.â€Â  Mother, on the other hand, testified Childâ€™s\r\n  surname should remain Wilson because Child lives with the Wilson family, Child is close to her half-sister, and â€œboth of them know now that their\r\n  last name is Wilson.â€Â  Motherâ€™s\r\n  half-sister testified to the difficulty she had experienced living in a\r\n  household with a different surname from that of other family members.\r\nThe GAL recommended changing Childâ€™s surname to either Stradford\r\n  or Wilson-Stradford, stating: â€œI think itâ€™s important that this child have the\r\n  recognition that she is her fatherâ€™s child and that she does have that strong\r\n  relationship with both families.â€Â  The\r\n  court stated from the bench it would grant Fatherâ€™s petition to change Childâ€™s\r\n  surname and issued a written order on April 15, 2007.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in granting Fatherâ€™s petition to change Childâ€™s\r\n  surname from Wilson to Stradford because Father failed to prove changing the\r\n  name was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  one parent petitions the court to remove the other parentâ€™s surname from the\r\n  partiesâ€™ minor child, each parent has a protectible interest in receiving\r\n  notice and being heard on the petition.Â  Ex parte Stull, 276 S.C. 512,\r\n  513, 280 S.E.2d 209, 210 (1981).Â  However, â€œthe parent seeking to change the\r\n  childâ€™s surname has the burden of proving that the change will further the childâ€™s\r\n  best interests.â€Â  Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 210, 532 S.E.2d 890,\r\n  893 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nIn Mazzone,\r\n  the family court granted the fatherâ€™s request to change the name of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ young child from motherâ€™s surname to his, in which it found: Â the\r\n  childâ€™s parents had never married; the child had been in the motherâ€™s custody\r\n  since birth; the father, mother, and child had lived together for two years;\r\n  the father had a close relationship with the child; and the child was\r\n  comfortable with her present name.Â  Mazzone, 341 S.C. 203. 532 S.E.2d\r\n  890.Â  On appeal, this court reversed, and identified nine factors to consider in\r\n  determining whether changing a childâ€™s surname is in the childâ€™s best interest,\r\n  including: (1) the length of time the child has\r\n  used the present surname; (2) the effect of the proposed change on the\r\n  preservation and development of the childâ€™s relationship with each parent; (3)\r\n  the identification of the child as part of a family unit; (4) the wishes of each\r\n  parent; (5) the reason the petitioning parent states for the proposed change;\r\n  (6) the motive of the petitioning parent and the possibility the childâ€™s use of\r\n  a different name will cause insecurity or a lack of identity; (7) the\r\n  difficulty, harassment, or embarrassment the child may experience if the child\r\n  bears a surname different from that of the custodial parent; (8) if the child\r\n  is of age and maturity to express a meaningful preference, the childâ€™s preference; and (9)\r\n  the degree of community respect associated with the present and proposed\r\n  surnames.Â  Id. at 210-11, 532 S.E.2d at 893-94.Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\n\t[B]oth\r\n  parents have an equal interest in the child bearing their respective surname . . . While it may\r\n  be a custom to name a child after the father, giving greater weight to the\r\n  fatherâ€™s interest fails to\r\n  consider that, where the parents have never been married, the mother has at\r\n  least an equal interest in\r\n  having the child bear the maternal surname. Â In these times of parental\r\n  equality, arguing that the child of unmarried parents should bear the paternal\r\n  surname based on custom is another way of arguing that it is permissible to\r\n  discriminate because the discrimination has been endured for many years.\r\n\r\nId. at 211-12, 532 S.E.2d at 894 (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the family courtâ€™s order recognized that Mazzone controlled\r\n  and noted the applicable burden of proof.Â  Although the order lists the Mazzone factors and states the court considered each factor, it does not contain\r\n  specific findings pursuant to Mazzone.Â  Applying the Mazzone factors to this case, as we are permitted to do under the broad scope of review\r\n  accorded to us, we make the following findings based on the preponderance of\r\n  evidence: Â (1) Child, who was three years old at the time of the hearing, is\r\n  known in the community by the Wilson name; (2) Child already is aware her name\r\n  is Wilson; (3) although we agree changing Childâ€™s name could help develop her\r\n  relationship with Fatherâ€™s family, it also could have a negative impact on\r\n  Childâ€™s continuing relationship with her custodial family; (4) Childâ€™s\r\n  relationship with Fatherâ€™s family will develop primarily through regular\r\n  participation in the visitation granted by the court; (5) Fatherâ€™s basis for changing\r\n  Childâ€™s name is insufficient; and (6) Child could experience embarrassment if\r\n  her name differs from that of her custodial family. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we reverse the order of the family court changing Childâ€™s surname to Wilson.Â  The decision of the family court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant\r\n  to the partiesâ€™ request and Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] Father\r\n  has a second daughter, who lives with her mother and is two years younger than\r\n  Child.Â  Mother has a second daughter, who lives\r\n  with her and is a year older than Child.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4394","title":"Platt v.

(CSX) of\r\n  the malfunctioning signals; and (3) the Departmentâ€™s negligence in failing to\r\n  maintain the traffic signals in compliance with the signal plans was a\r\n  proximate cause of the collision.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn June 19, 1999,\r\n  William Corley was driving Valerie Platt, Asia Platt, and William Corley Jr.,\r\n  in his automobile on Red Bank Road toward Highway 52 in Goose Creek, South Carolina.[1]Â \r\n  Red Bank Road intersects both Highway 52 and a CSX railroad track, which are\r\n  parallel to one another.Â  In the direction Corley was traveling, he would cross\r\n  over the railroad tracks before entering the Red Bank Road and Highway 52\r\n  intersection.Â  There were railroad crossing arms and warning lights\r\n  approximately two car lengths on either side of the railroad tracks. \r\nAs Corley approached the intersection of Red Bank Road and Highway\r\n  52, traffic was stopped at the traffic signal.Â  While Corley waited, the railroad track crossing arms and\r\n  warning lights activated and lowered in front of his vehicle.Â  A train did not\r\n  pass, the crossing arms lifted, and Corley drove forward.Â  Soon thereafter, the\r\n  crossing arms again lowered, placing Corleyâ€™s vehicle between the crossing arms\r\n  and the railroad tracks.Â  Testimony differs regarding Corleyâ€™s actions\r\n  at this point, but it appears Corley backed up at least once to ensure his\r\n  vehicle was clear from the tracks. Â At least one vehicle was in front of\r\n  Corleyâ€™s but on the other side of the tracks between the tracks and the stop\r\n  light at Highway 52.Â  Prior to the trainâ€™s arrival, no vehicles blocked Corleyâ€™s\r\n  forward progress to the intersection. Â Corley drove forward and was\r\n  struck by an oncoming CSX train.Â  Asia Platt was the sole survivor in the\r\n  vehicle, and has since been cared for by her maternal grandmother, Beaulah\r\n  Platt. \r\nBeaulah Platt, as the guardian for Asia\r\n  Platt and personal representative of the estates of Valerie and William Platt,\r\n  filed a negligence action against CSX and the Department.Â  Beaulah Platt and\r\n  CSX reached a settlement agreement prior to oral argument on the Departmentâ€™s summary\r\n  judgment motion.Â  The trial court granted the Departmentâ€™s summary judgment\r\n  motion, finding: (1) the Department fulfilled its duty by reporting defects in\r\n  the warning signals to CSX; (2) the Department had no duty to make repairs of\r\n  the crossing arms; (3) the Code of Federal Regulations vests only CSX with the\r\n  duty to maintain crossing signals; and (4) the proximate cause of the collision\r\n  was a malfunction of the crossing arms and not the Departmentâ€™s traffic\r\n  signals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP, summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 633 S.E.2d 505 (2006); Houck v.\r\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329\r\n  (2005); Bradley v. Doe, 374 S.C. 622, 649 S.E.2d 153 (Ct. App. 2007); Bennett\r\n    v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 635 S.E.2d 649 (Ct. App. 2006); see Rule 56(c), SCRCP (â€œThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.â€).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall\r\n    Co., 363 S.C. 334, 611 S.E.2d 485 (2005); Medical Univ. of S.C. v.\r\n      Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Hackworth v. Greenville\r\n        County, 371 S.C. 99, 102, 637 S.E.2d 320, 322 (Ct. App. 2006); Rife v.\r\n          Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nâ€œSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  BPS, 362 S.C. at\r\n  325, 608 S.E.2d at 159; see also Higgins v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 592, 486 S.E.2d 269 (Ct. App. 1997) (a trial judge\r\n  considering a motion for summary judgment must consider all documents and\r\n  evidence within the record, including pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on\r\n  file, and affidavits).Â  â€œOn\r\n  appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review\r\n  all ambiguities, conclusions, and\r\n  inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party below.â€Â  Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. The\r\n    State of South Carolina, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).Â  \r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into where further inquiry\r\n  into the facts is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000); Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).Â  Even when there is no dispute\r\n  as to evidentiary facts, summary judgment is not appropriate if there is\r\n  disagreement concerning the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.Â  Moriarty\r\n    v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000); Ellis\r\n      v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when\r\n  plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot\r\n  differ, summary judgment should be granted.Â  BPS,\r\n  362 S.C. at 325, 608 S.E.2d at 159.Â  \r\nThe purpose of summary judgment\r\n  is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a\r\n  fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438\r\n  (2003) (quoting George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874\r\n  (2001)); Moore v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 217, 644 S.E.2d 740, 744 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007); Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 596-97, 608 S.E.2d 587,\r\n  592 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Because summary judgment is a drastic remedy, summary\r\n  judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure a litigant is not improperly\r\n  deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz\r\n    Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 644, 594 S.E.2d 455, 462 (2004); B\r\n      &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™ Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Public Duty Rule\r\nPlatt avers the\r\n  Department had a duty to protect the public from a dangerous condition created\r\n  by the malfunctioning warning device.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe public duty rule was originally adopted by the South Carolina Supreme Court in Parker v.\r\n  Brown, 195 S.C. 35, 52, 10 S.E.2d 625, 632 (1940):\r\n\r\n\tThe law\r\n  necessarily grants certain discretion to its officers in handling the public\r\n  business.Â  In one instance it may be wise for a public officer to pursue one\r\n  course, in another instance, another course. Those charged with protecting the\r\n  public interest should view that interest as supreme, should consider what is\r\n  best for the public, and should be free at all times to prosecute the course\r\n  that appears to be in the public interest . . . .Â  It is well settled that an\r\n  individual has no right of action against a public officer for breach of a duty\r\n  owing to the public only, even though such individual be specially injured\r\n  thereby. Where a duty is owing to the public\r\n  only, an officer is not liable to an individual who may have been incidentally\r\n  injured by his failure to perform it. \r\n\r\nUnder South\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s public duty doctrine, public\r\n  officials are not liable to individuals for their negligence in discharging\r\n  public duties as the duty is owed to the public at large rather than to anyone\r\n  individually.Â  Tanner v. Florence Co. Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 561, 521\r\n  S.E.2d 153, 158 (1999); Jensen v. Anderson County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 199, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 615, 617 (1991); Arthurs v. Aiken County,&nbsp;338 S.C. 253, 262,\r\n  525 S.E.2d 542, 546&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (Arthurs I) affâ€™d as\r\n    modified, 346 S.C. 97, 551 S.E.2d 579 (2001) (Arthurs II).\r\nThe public duty rule is not a separate legal doctrine.Â  Arthurs I,&nbsp;\r\n  338 S.C. at 262, 525 S.E.2d at 546; Rayfield v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 297\r\n  S.C. 95, 105, 374 S.E.2d 910, 915 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The public duty rule is a\r\n  special application of the broader\r\n  principle that an action for negligence based upon an alleged violation of a\r\n  statute cannot be maintained if the statute was enacted for a purpose other\r\n  than preventing the complained of injury.Â  Arthurs I, 338 S.C. at 262,\r\n  525 S.E.2d at 546; Rayfield, 297 S.C. at 105, 374 S.E.2d at 915.Â  The\r\n  rule applies to the special case of statutes which create or define the duties\r\n  of a public office.Â  Rayfield, 297 S.C. at 105, 374 S.E.2d at 915.\r\nAn essential element in a\r\n  negligence cause of action is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the\r\n  defendant to the plaintiff.Â  Wyatt v. Fowler, 326 S.C. 97, 101, 484\r\n  S.E.2d 590, 592 (1997); Rogers v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Parole and Cmty. Corr.,\r\n  320 S.C. 253, 255, 464 S.E.2d 330, 332 (1995).Â  Without such a duty, there can\r\n  be no actionable negligence.Â  Rogers, 320 S.C. at 255, 464 S.E.2d at\r\n  592.Â  To prevail in a negligence action, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a\r\n  duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty\r\n  by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the\r\n  breach.Â  Tanner, 336 S.C. at 561, 521 S.E.2d at 158.Â  The court must\r\n  determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.Â  Steinke\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520\r\n  S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999); see also Rogers v. Atl. Coast Line\r\n    R.R., 222 S.C. 66, 71 S.E.2d 585 (1952) (whether defendant is under legal\r\n  duty to plaintiff is question of law for court); Araujo v. S. Bell Tel. and\r\n    Tel. Co., 291 S.C. 54, 351 S.E.2d 908 (Ct. App. 1986) (question of whether\r\n  defendant owes duty, the breach of which\r\n  may constitute negligence, is a question of law, not of fact). \r\nOrdinarily,\r\n  there is no common law duty to act.Â  Arthurs I,&nbsp; 338 S.C. at 264,\r\n  525 S.E.2d at 547.Â  However, an affirmative legal duty may be created by\r\n  statute, contract relationship, status, property interest, or some other\r\n  special circumstance.Â  Jensen, 304 S.C. at 199, 403 S.E.2d at 617.Â  Many\r\n  statutes impose an affirmative duty on public officials to perform certain\r\n  acts. Arthurs I, 338 S.C. at 264, 525 S.E.2d at 547; Wells v. City of\r\n    Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 306, 501 S.E.2d 746, 752&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998).Â  Normally,\r\n  such officials enjoy immunity from a private cause of action under the public\r\n  duty rule. Wells, 331 S.C. at 307, 501 S.E.2d at 752.Â  This rule limits public\r\n  officialsâ€™ liability to individuals for their negligence in\r\n  discharging public duties as the duty is owed to the public at large rather\r\n  than an individual.Â  Id.Â  Thus, when the duty is owed to the public in\r\n  general, the official is not liable to an individual who may have been\r\n  incidentally injured by the failure to perform the duty.Â  Id.Â  An\r\n  exception to the general rule against liability exists when a duty is owed to\r\n  specific individuals rather than the public at large.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  public duty rule â€œpresumes statutes which create or define the duties of a\r\n  public office have the essential purpose of providing for the structure and\r\n  operation of government or for securing the general welfare and safety of the\r\n  public.â€Â  Arthurs I, 338 S.C. at 265, 525 S.E.2d at 548; Tanner,\r\n  336 S.C. at 562, 521 S.E.2d at 158; Wells, 331 S.C. at 308, 501 S.E.2d\r\n  at 752.Â  Generally, such statutes create no duty of care towards individual\r\n  members of the public. Arthurs I, 338 S.C. at 265, 525 S.E.2d at 548.Â  An\r\n  exception is recognized where the plaintiff can establish the defendant owed a\r\n  special duty of care to the plaintiff.Â  Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 294,\r\n  408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991); Arthurs I, 338 S.C. at 265, 525 S.E.2d at\r\n  548; Wells, 331 S.C. at 308, 501 S.E.2d at 752.\r\nTo determine if a special duty is owed to the\r\n  plaintiff, the court looks to the statute and the facts of the particular case.Â  Arthurs I, 338 S.C. at 265, 525 S.E.2d at 548.Â  In Rayfield, 297\r\n  S.C. at 106, 374 S.E.2d at 916, this court articulated a six-part test for\r\n  determining whether a statute creates a special duty to an individual member of\r\n  the public:\r\n\r\n\t(1) an\r\n  essential purpose of the statute is to protect against a particular kind of\r\n  harm; (2) the statute, either\r\n  directly or indirectly, imposes on a specific public officer a duty to guard\r\n  against or not cause that harm; (3) the class of persons the statute intends to\r\n  protect is identifiable before the fact; (4) the plaintiff is a person within\r\n  the protected class; (5) the public officer knows or has reason to know of the\r\n  likelihood of harm to members of the class if he fails to do his duty; and (6)\r\n  the officer is given sufficient authority to act in the circumstances or he\r\n  undertakes to act in the exercise of his office. \r\n\r\nSee also Jensen, 304 S.C. at\r\n  200, 403 S.E.2d at 617 (wherein the supreme court adopted the Rayfield six\r\n  step special duty analysis as an exception to the public duty rule).Â  A\r\n  plaintiff may prevail against a public duty defense if the statute not only\r\n  concerns the duties of a public office, but has the essential purpose of\r\n  protecting identifiable individuals from a particular kind of harm. Arthurs\r\n    I, 338 S.C. at 265, 525 S.E.2d at 547-48.Â  In such cases, the statute\r\n  creates a special duty which may give rise to a negligence suit against an\r\n  officer for failure to perform his duties properly.Â  Id.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina courts have been â€œreluctant to\r\n  find special duties statutorily imposed.â€Â  Tanner, 336 S.C. at\r\n  562, 521 S.E.2d at 158.Â  See, e.g., Brady Dev. Co. v. Town of\r\n    Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 439 S.E.2d 266 (1993) (holding city owed\r\n  lot purchaser no special duty of care in issuing development permit under\r\n  municipal development standards ordinance, and thus, could not be held liable\r\n  to purchaser for alleged negligence in issuing permit to developer); Bellamy,\r\n  305 S.C. at 291, 408 S.E.2d at 219 (finding statutorily prescribed exceptions\r\n  to the disclosure requirements of the Stateâ€™s Freedom of Information Act did\r\n  not establish a duty to maintain confidentiality); Wells, 331 S.C. at 296,\r\n  501 S.E.2d at 746 (ruling plaintiff could not sue city for failing to maintain\r\n  fire hydrants because suit was\r\n  barred by a provision of the Tort Claims Act and city owed duty only to public\r\n  generally); Summers v. Harrison Constr., 298 S.C. 451, 381 S.E.2d 493\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989) (concluding a State statute requiring officers\r\n  who issue building permits to secure evidence that the builders and renovators\r\n  of residences are licensed did not create a special, actionable duty to protect\r\n  homeowners); Rayfield, 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (explaining a State\r\n  statute requiring prison and parole officials to prepare adequate reports\r\n  concerning parole candidates did not create a special duty to protect\r\n  particular members of the public against crimes committed by released\r\n  prisoners).Â  \r\nIn Arthurs\r\n  v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97, 551 S.E.2d 579 (2001), the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court first considered the public duty rule and its interplay with the\r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act).Â  See also Trousdell v. Cannon,&nbsp;\r\n  351 S.C. 636, 641, 572 S.E.2d 264, 266- 67&nbsp;(2002).Â  Arthurs confirmed the continuing viability of the public duty rule and its\r\n  compatibility with the Tort Claims Act, but clarified when the public duty rule\r\n  can be properly raised.Â  Trousdell,&nbsp; 351 S.C. at 641, 572 S.E.2d at\r\n  266-67.Â  The Arthurs court stated, â€œ[w]hen, and only when, the plaintiff\r\n  relies upon a statute as creating the duty does a doctrine known as the â€˜public\r\n  duty ruleâ€™ come into play.â€Â  Id. at 103, 551 S.E.2d at 582.Â  In other\r\n  words, when the plaintiffâ€™s negligence claim is founded upon a government\r\n  entityâ€™s statutorily created duty, the question of â€œwhether that duty will\r\n  support the claim should be analyzed under the rule. On the other hand, where\r\n  the duty relied upon is based upon the common law, . . . then the existence of\r\n  that duty is analyzed as it\r\n  would be were the defendant a private entity.â€Â  Id. at 105, 551 S.E.2d\r\n  at 583.\r\n\r\n  Platt urges this court to find the Department had a statutory duty to\r\n  protect the public pursuant to section 57-5-10 of the South Carolina Code (2006)\r\n  which provides: â€œThe state highway system shall consist of a statewide system\r\n  of connecting highways which shall be constructed by the Department of\r\n  Transportation and which shall be maintained by the department in a safe and\r\n  serviceable condition as state highways . . . .â€Â  Because Plattâ€™s claim is\r\n  based upon a statutorily created duty it must be analyzed under the public duty\r\n  rule.Â  Where, as here, the statutory duty is owed to the public as a whole, the\r\n  â€œpublic duty ruleâ€ bars Platt from maintaining a negligence action against the Department.Â \r\n  As a result, the public duty rule bars Plattâ€™s claims unless a special duty is\r\n  owed by the Department.Â  \r\nMoreover, we find the\r\n  Department did not owe a special duty of care to Asia Platt, Valerie Platt, and\r\n  William Leroy Platt.Â  From her brief, Platt contends the protected class is the\r\n  â€œtraveling public.â€Â  However, this class is not found in the statute but rather\r\n  is a post hoc class created in light of this tragic accident.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-10.Â  Because the statute created no special duty from the\r\n  Department to Asia Platt, Valerie Platt, and William Leroy Platt, the trial\r\n  court properly granted the Departmentâ€™s summary judgment on the statutory duty\r\n  claims.\r\nII.Â  Federal Preemption\r\nPlatt maintains the\r\n  trial court erred in finding the Department satisfied its duty to report\r\n  defects in highway-rail grade crossing warning systems to CSX.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 20106 (West 2007), applicable federal regulations may pre-empt\r\n  any state â€œlaw, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad\r\n  safety.â€[2]Â \r\n  Thus, the issue before the Court is whether the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary)\r\n  has issued regulations covering the same subject matter as South Carolina law\r\n  pertaining to malfunctioning crossing arms and false activations. \r\nWhere\r\n  a state statute conflicts with, or frustrates, federal law, the former must\r\n  give way.Â  U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2; Maryland v. Louisiana,\r\n  451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981).Â  â€œIn the interest\r\n  of avoiding unintended encroachment on the authority of the states, however, a\r\n  court interpreting a federal statute pertaining to a subject traditionally\r\n  governed by state law will be reluctant to find pre-emption.â€Â  CSX Transp.,\r\n    Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664 (1993).Â  Thus, pre-emption will not\r\n  lie unless it is â€œthe clear and manifest purpose of Congress.â€Â  Id.; Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).Â  Evidence of\r\n  pre-emptive purpose is sought in the text and structure of the statute at\r\n  issue.Â  Easterwood, 507 U.S. at 644; Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,\r\n  463 U.S. 85, 95, (1983).Â  If the statute contains an express pre-emption\r\n  clause, â€œthe task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on\r\n  the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of\r\n  Congressâ€™ pre-emptive intent.â€Â  Easterwood, 507 U.S. at 644.\r\nIn\r\n  1970, Congress enacted the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA) â€œto promote\r\n  safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce railroad-related\r\n  accidents and incidents.â€Â  49 U.S.C.A Â§ 20101 (West 2007). Â The FRSA grants the\r\n  Secretary the authority to â€œprescribe regulations and issue orders for every\r\n  area of railroad safety,â€ 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 20103(a) (West 2007), and directs the\r\n  Secretary to â€œmaintain a coordinated effort to develop and carry out solutions\r\n  to the railroad grade crossing problem.â€ 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 20134(a) (West 2007).Â  The\r\n  FRSA also contains an express pre-emption provision, which articulates:\r\n\r\n\tLaws,\r\n  regulations, and orders related to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform\r\n  to the extent practicable. A State may adopt or continue in force a law,\r\n  regulation, or order related to railroad safety until the Secretary of\r\n  Transportation prescribes a regulation or issues\r\n  an order covering the subject matter of the State requirement.\r\n\r\n49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 20106; see\r\n  also Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Shanklin, 529 U.S. 344, 348 (2000).\r\nâ€œThree\r\n  years after passing the FRSA, Congress enacted the Highway Safety Act of 1973,\r\n  Â§ 203, 87 Stat. 283, which, among other things, created the Federal\r\n  Railway-Highway Crossings Programâ€ (Crossings Program).Â  Shanklin, 529 U.S. at 348; see 23 U.S.C.A Â§ 130 (West 2007).Â  The Crossings Program makes funds\r\n  available to states for the â€œcost of construction of projects for the\r\n  elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings.â€Â  23 U.S.C.A. Â§ 130(a).Â  To\r\n  participate in the Crossings Program, all states must â€œconduct and\r\n  systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those railroad\r\n  crossings which may require separation, relocation, or protective devices, and\r\n  establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.â€Â  23 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  130(d).Â  That schedule must, â€œ[a]t a minimum, . . . provide signs for all\r\n  railway-highway crossings.â€Â  Id.\r\nOne\r\n  regulation promulgated by the Secretary, through the Federal Highway Administration\r\n  (FHWA), addresses the adequacy of warning devices installed under the Crossings\r\n  Program.Â  23 C.F.R. Â§ 646.214(b).Â  According to section 646.214(b)(3), adequate\r\n  warning devices â€œon any project where Federal-aid funds participate in the\r\n  installation of the devices are to include automatic gates with flashing light\r\n  signals.â€Â  Because these regulations â€œestablish requirements as to the\r\n  installation of particular warning devices . . . when they are applicable,\r\n  state tort law is pre-empted.â€Â  Shanklin, 529 U.S. at 353. \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Secretary, through the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), has\r\n  promulgated several regulations for the design and installation of crossing\r\n  warning devices and other areas of railroad safety.Â  These regulations include\r\n  additional preemption provisions:\r\n\r\n\tUnder\r\n  49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of these regulations preempts any State law,\r\n  regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except an additional or\r\n  more stringent law, regulation, or order that is necessary to eliminate or\r\n  reduce an essentially local safety hazard; is not incompatible with a law,\r\n  regulation, or order of the United States Government; and that does not impose\r\n  an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n  49 C.F.R. Â§ 213.2.Â  \r\nIn CSX\r\n  Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U.S. 658 (1993), the United States Supreme\r\n  Court addressed the pre-emptive effect of the FHWAâ€™s regulations implementing\r\n  the Crossings Program.Â  The Easterwood court explained the language of\r\n  the FRSAâ€™s pre-emption provision dictates that, to pre-empt state law, the\r\n  federal regulation must â€œcoverâ€ the same subject matter, and not merely â€œâ€˜touch\r\n  uponâ€™ or â€˜relate toâ€™ that subject matter.â€Â  Id., at 664; see also 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 20106 (West 2007). Thus, â€œpre-emption will lie only if the federal\r\n  regulations substantially subsume the subject matter of the relevant state law.â€Â  Easterwood, at 664.\r\nIn Easterwood,\r\n  the Court concluded a wifeâ€™s wrongful death action alleging a railroad company\r\n  was negligent under Georgia law for failing to maintain adequate warning\r\n  devices at a crossing was not pre-empted because the warning devices for which\r\n  federal funds had been obtained were never actually installed at the crossing\r\n  where the accident occurred.Â  807 U.S. at 673.Â  Conversely in Shanklin,\r\n  the United States Supreme Court found state law tort claims for inadequacy of\r\n  warning devices were pre-empted when the devices are actually installed\r\n  with the use of federal funds.Â  529 U.S. at 359 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe Code\r\n  of Federal Regulations in addressing a warning system malfunction states:\r\n\r\n\t(a)\r\n  Upon receipt of a credible report of a warning system malfunction, a railroad\r\n  having maintenance responsibility for the warning system shall promptly\r\n  investigate the report and determine the nature of the malfunction. The\r\n  railroad shall take appropriate action as required by Â§ 234.207.Â  (b) Until repair or correction\r\n  of the warning system is completed, the railroad shall provide alternative\r\n  means of warning highway traffic and railroad employees in accordance with Â§Â§\r\n  234.105, 234.106 or 234.107 of this part.Â  (c) Nothing in this subpart requires repair of a warning\r\n  system, if, acting in accordance with applicable State law, the railroad\r\n  proceeds to discontinue or dismantle the warning system. However, until repair,\r\n  correction, discontinuance, or dismantling of the warning system is completed,\r\n  the railroad shall comply with this subpart to ensure the safety of the\r\n  traveling public and railroad employees\r\n\r\n49 C.F.R. Â§ 234.103.Â  Further,\r\n  when a railroad company â€œreceives a credible report of a false activation, a\r\n  railroad having maintenance responsibility for the highway-rail grade crossing\r\n  warning system shall promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and\r\n  railroad employees at the crossing . . . .â€Â  49\r\n  C.F.R. Â§ 234.107.Â  \r\nPlatt\r\n  relies on South Carolina Code section 57-5-10 (2006), in alleging the\r\n  Department was responsible for the malfunctioning signals.Â  Section 57-5-10 provides,\r\n  â€œThe state highway system shall consist of a statewide system of connecting\r\n  highways which shall be constructed by the Department of Transportation and\r\n  which shall be maintained by the department in a safe and serviceable condition\r\n  as state highways . . . .â€Â  In the case at hand, the warning devices in place\r\n  at Red Bank Road were funded by the FHWA under the Crossings Program.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the regulations in place gave CSX maintenance responsibility once they received\r\n  a credible report of a warning system malfunction or false activation.Â Â  49\r\n  C.F.R. Â§ 234.103.Â  As a result Plattâ€™s claims based on state law are pre-empted\r\n  because the federal regulations subsume the state statute by imposing these\r\n  duties upon CSX, not the Department.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Proximate Cause\r\nPlatt\r\n  advances the Departmentâ€™s negligence in failing to maintain the traffic signals\r\n  was a proximate cause of the collision.Â  This issue fails on the merits.\r\n\r\n\t[P]roximate cause is the efficient, or direct, cause-the thing\r\n  which brings about the injuries complained of. Negligence is not actionable\r\n  unless it is a proximate cause of the injuries, and it\r\n  may be deemed a proximate cause only when without such\r\n  negligence the injury would not have occurred or could have been avoided.Â  \r\n\r\nHughes v. Childrenâ€™s\r\n  Clinic, P.A., 269 S.C. 389, 398, 237 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1977).Â  Proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact and\r\n  legal cause.Â  Oliver v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 309 S.C.\r\n  313, 316, 422 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992).Â  Causation in fact is proved by\r\n  establishing the plaintiffâ€™s injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the\r\n  defendantâ€™s negligence. Â Id.Â  Legal cause is proved by establishing\r\n  foreseeability.Â  Id. â€œForeseeability is determined by looking to the\r\n  natural and probable consequences of the act complained of.Â  A plaintiff\r\n  therefore proves legal cause by establishing the injury in question occurred as\r\n  a natural and probable consequence of the defendantâ€™s negligence.â€Â  Vinson\r\n    v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 400, 477 S.E.2d 715, 721 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nOrdinarily,\r\n  the question of proximate cause is one of fact for the jury and the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s sole function regarding the issue is to inquire whether particular\r\n  conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the\r\n  evidence.Â  Kennedy v. Custom Ice Equip. Co., 271 S.C. 171, 246 S.E.2d\r\n  176 (1978); Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc.,&nbsp; 329 S.C. 448, 464, 494\r\n  S.E.2d 835, 843&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997); see also Oliver, 309\r\n  S.C. at 313, 422 S.E.2d at 128 (holding the legal cause component of proximate\r\n  cause is ordinarily question of fact for jury); Childers v. Gas Lines, Inc.,\r\n  248 S.C. 316, 149 S.E.2d 761 (1966) (explicating questions of proximate cause\r\n  are normally within province of jury).Â  The particular facts and circumstances\r\n  of each case determine whether the question of proximate cause should be\r\n  decided by the court or by the jury. Newton v. S.C. Pub. Rys. Commâ€™n,\r\n  312 S.C. 107, 439 S.E.2d 285 (Ct. App. 1993), revâ€™d on other grounds,\r\n  319 S.C. 430, 462 S.E.2d 266 (1995).Â  Only when the evidence is susceptible to\r\n  only one inference does it become a matter of law for the court.Â  Small,&nbsp;\r\n  329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d at 843. \r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, Platt failed to prove any negligent act or omission\r\n  attributable to the Department is the proximate cause of the collision.Â  The record contains no evidence but for a different signal\r\n  sequence, there would not have been a collision.Â  Several eyewitnesses testified no cars\r\n  blocked Corleyâ€™s ability to move forward in the direction of the traffic light\r\n  in order to clear the tracks.Â  Plattâ€™s own expert witness admitted he did not\r\n  focus on the sequencing of the lights because the gate arm malfunction created\r\n  the situation leading to the collision.\r\nWitness Ann Turnball, who saw the collision from a nearby parking\r\n  lot, described the accident:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tâ€¦ I noticed that the car did not move.&nbsp; The \r\n\t\t\tlightsâ€”the cars in front of him moved, they went forward through the \r\n\t\t\tgreen light.&nbsp; The light turned red.&nbsp; I noticed that the \r\n\t\t\tcar stayed in that particular position.&nbsp; It didnâ€™t move \r\n\t\t\tanywhere.&nbsp; I noted aâ€”I then noticed that the bar for the \r\n\t\t\ttrainâ€”the lights came on flashing and I noticed the bar came down \r\n\t\t\tand the car was right in front of the bar.&nbsp; I remember hearing \r\n\t\t\twhistles and brakesâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd he was between the tracks and the arm?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Yes, maâ€™am.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tOkay, can youâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI then noticedâ€”well, my friend Holly and I had aâ€”we \r\n\t\t\twere screaming.&nbsp; I know I was screaming, asking what in the \r\n\t\t\tworld has that car doing, why wasnâ€™t it moving.&nbsp; I then noticed \r\n\t\t\tthat the rearâ€”the reverse lights on the car came on.&nbsp; And I \r\n\t\t\tscreamed saying, what are you doing, go forward.&nbsp; I then \r\n\t\t\tnoticed that the car tried to go forward and stopped.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAnd then the carâ€™s reverse lights came on again, the car tried to\r\n  back up again and stopped.Â  And then I noticed that the car tried to put all\r\n  the gas it possibly could to go.Â  And thatâ€™s when the train hit them.\r\nHolly\r\n  Anne Daniels, who was in the company of Ann Turnball, testified:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tSo the warning lights are going off and you looked \r\n\t\t\tup and you saw a four-door cream-colored car stopped withâ€”to the \r\n\t\t\textent where the lowering arm would have been behind him?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\t(Nodded.)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tWell, did you see the arm come down or was it \r\n\t\t\talready down when you noticed the cream-colored vehicle?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI remember seeing it start to come down.&nbsp; I \r\n\t\t\tdonâ€™t know if I must have turned my eyes for a second or looked at \r\n\t\t\tAnn, because the next thing I remember looking at is when I saw it \r\n\t\t\twas down completely.&nbsp; Thatâ€™s when I notice the cream-colored \r\n\t\t\tcar sitting there.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tOkay.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAt that point Ann and I both got a little frantic, \r\n\t\t\tsaying, why isnâ€™t he moving.&nbsp; Thereâ€™s aâ€”you know, thereâ€™s a car \r\n\t\t\ton the tracks, whatâ€™s he doing?&nbsp; At that point I noticed when \r\n\t\t\tthe light was green and there were no cars in front of him, I \r\n\t\t\tstarted to say, go forward, go forward, go forward.&nbsp; At that \r\n\t\t\tpoint I remember seeing his brake lights come on.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHe went in reverse for just a second, and he stopped, went forward\r\n  for second, he kind of jerked forward.Â  The reverse lights came on again to go\r\n  back.Â  He stopped.Â  And then at the last second I guess he tried to go\r\n  forward.Â  He, I assumed, gunned the car because the car started to swivel a\r\n  little bit and you could bear the tires peeling.Â  And at that point the train\r\n  hit them.Â  \r\nAnother witness in the same parking lot saw the train hit Corleyâ€™s\r\n  car.Â  David Wayne Minor similarly stated the Corley moved his car forward and\r\n  backwards before the collision.Â  Minor was asked about his observations of any\r\n  traffic ahead of Corley:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDo you recollect whether there were any vehicles \r\n\t\t\tdirectly in front of that car that would have prohibited him from \r\n\t\t\tgoing ahead and driving across the tracks and getting out of the \r\n\t\t\tway?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦[t]hey werenâ€™t close enough to\r\n  the tracks to prohibit him from crossing the tracks in this forward movement.Â \r\n  Nor do I recall a car being directly behind that gate.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tSo there was nothing that would physically have \r\n\t\t\tobstructed him from going across the track and getting out of the \r\n\t\t\tway.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tIn my opinion there wasnâ€™t, no.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn his\r\n  deposition, Plattâ€™s expert witness, Dr. Kenneth Heathington, offered a general\r\n  description of traffic signal preemption.Â  He acknowledged the railroad warning\r\n  system and the traffic lights were interconnected.Â  However, he admitted the\r\n  focus of his investigation did not center on the traffic signals:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAnd whatâ€™s your understanding of how it worked?|\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWell, it was preempting.&nbsp; In other words, you \r\n\t\t\twouldâ€”and I didnâ€™t look at the traffic signal thing in detail, \r\n\t\t\tbecause I didnâ€™t think thatâ€™s where the problem was, for thatâ€”for \r\n\t\t\tthis particular accident, I thought it was a malfunction of the gate \r\n\t\t\tarms.&nbsp; â€¦.&nbsp; Now, I didnâ€™t go through and check out exactly \r\n\t\t\thow all the signal cycles worked or anything of this nature, because \r\n\t\t\tto me, this particular accident was a function of the failure of the \r\n\t\t\tgate arm system itselfâ€¦. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nErgo, the trial court did not err in holding there was no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to the proximate cause of the collision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J. (concurring):Â  I concur in\r\n  result.Â  I write separately because I would affirm on the sole basis of federal\r\n  preemption as to the claims against the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Transportation in connection with the warning devices at the railway crossing.Â \r\n  Even assuming the Department owed a duty under state law in connection with the\r\n  railway crossing warning devices under the facts presented, any such state tort\r\n  law duty imposed on the Department was preempted by federal law.Â  Concerning\r\n  the preemption issue, I join in the thorough analysis by Judge Anderson.Â  This\r\n  would serve as an alternative sustaining ground to the trial courtâ€™s grant of\r\n  summary judgment on the basis of a lack of proximate cause.Â  I further find it\r\n  appropriate to rely on the preemption ground as an alternative sustaining\r\n  ground, for the issue was squarely before the trial court.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.\r\n    Town of Mt.

Mitchell appeals his convictions for murder, attempted armed\r\n  robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime,\r\n  arguing the trial judge made several erroneous evidentiary rulings.Â  We affirm\r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS AND\r\n  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe\r\n  victim, David Martin, lived close to his father, Nathaniel Martin, in a mobile\r\n  home and ran Nathanielâ€™s farm for a living.Â  There was evidence that David sold\r\n  marijuana and cocaine out of his mobile home.\r\nOn\r\n  March 2, 2003, around 11:00 p.m., Thomas Anthony, a family friend who was\r\n  staying with David at the time, knocked on Nathanielâ€™s window and told him\r\n  David had been shot.Â  Nathaniel and his wife went to Davidâ€™s mobile home, where\r\n  they found him lying on the floor. Unable to elicit any response from David,\r\n  they called 911.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Nathaniel, Anthony, who was deceased when the matter came to trial, informed\r\n  him three persons were involved in the incident. Â Two of the participants were\r\n  males wearing masks, neither of whom Anthony could identify.Â  Anthony did,\r\n  however, identify the third participant as Bridgett Darby. Â Darby used to rent\r\n  the mobile home where David was residing at the time of his death.\r\nOfficers\r\n  then located and arrested Darby.Â  On March 3, 2003, at 1:33 p.m., Darby gave a\r\n  written statement implicating herself and naming Kelvin Johnson and Terrance\r\n  James.[1]Â \r\n  In the statement, Darby said the three â€œtalked about getting together to do to\r\n  David Martinâ€™s house to rob him.â€Â  Darby further stated the three only intended\r\n  to take marijuana from David and then flee the scene without injuring him.Â  She\r\n  further maintained the shooting was an accident and she learned about it only\r\n  after the three later met at her home.Â  In addition to giving the written\r\n  statement, Darby also told police that both Kelvin Johnson and Terrance James were\r\n  from Columbia.\r\nDarby\r\n  then accompanied police officers to Columbia to help them find Kelvin Johnson\r\n  and Terrance James.Â  Officers consulted Richland County authorities, but were\r\n  still unable to locate either individual.Â  They then confronted Darby about the\r\n  accuracy of her information. Â At 8:00 p.m. the same day, Darby gave a second\r\n  statement, this time naming Mitchell instead of Terrance James as the third\r\n  accomplice.\r\nPolice\r\n  apprehended seventeen-year-old Kelvin Johnson during the early morning hours of\r\n  March 4, 2003.Â  About eight or nine hours later, Johnson gave a written\r\n  statement in which he admitted he had panicked and shot David when he saw David\r\n  reach for a gun.Â  In the statement, Johnson also implicated Mitchell,\r\n  specifically noting (1) Mitchell had helped in supplying the guns that they\r\n  used to rob David; (2) following the incident, he, Darby, and Mitchell checked\r\n  into the Southern Lodge; and (3) the three divided the money they had seized\r\n  from David during the robbery.Â  Two days later, Mitchell voluntarily submitted\r\n  to police custody.\r\nIn\r\n  October 2004, the Orangeburg County Grand Jury indicted Mitchell for the\r\n  offenses of murder, attempted armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during\r\n  the commission of a violent crime.Â  A jury trial in the matter commenced\r\n  December 13, 2005.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Darby testified for the State, giving information consistent with her\r\n  second statement and acknowledging she was serving sentences for accessory\r\n  after the fact and armed robbery because of her participation in the incident.Â \r\n  She testified she and Mitchell worked together, were romantically involved, and\r\n  had discussed robbing David Martin before the incident took place.Â  Darby also\r\n  admitted a rifle used in the incident belonged to her uncle; however, she also\r\n  stated she did not know how a pistol believed to be the murder weapon was\r\n  acquired.\r\nThe\r\n  State then called Johnson to the stand.Â  Johnson had previously pled guilty to\r\n  and was sentenced for murder, armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during\r\n  the commission of a violent crime. Â Outside the presence of the jury, Johnson\r\n  complained to the trial judge that the solicitorâ€™s office had â€œforcedâ€ him to\r\n  appear at Mitchellâ€™s trial and threatened him with additional time in prison if\r\n  he did not â€œcome up here and make this man be guilty.â€Â  In response, the trial\r\n  judge advised Johnson that (1) both the State and the defense had the right to\r\n  subpoena witnesses and any witnesses who refused to answer questions while on\r\n  the stand could be held in contempt of court and sentenced to six months; (2)\r\n  untruthful answers could result in perjury charges, for which the sentence\r\n  could be five years; and (3) when Johnson pled guilty to the charges for which\r\n  he was sentenced, he gave a statement under oath adopting the statement that he\r\n  had previously given to the police about the incident.\r\nWhen\r\n  the jury returned to the courtroom, Johnson, after some prodding, affirmed to\r\n  tell the truth.Â  When the solicitor began to question him, Johnson was uncooperative,\r\n  giving unresponsive answers and again accusing the State of forcing him to\r\n  appear in court.Â  When Johnson persisted in refusing to answer the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  questions, even after the trial judge warned him of the consequences, the trial\r\n  judge sentenced him for contempt and ordered officers to remove him from the\r\n  courtroom.\r\nThe\r\n  State moved to introduce Johnsonâ€™s statement through its next witness, Captain\r\n  Rene Williams of the Orangeburg County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  During an in camera\r\n  hearing, the trial judge, over objections from the defense, found Johnson had\r\n  given his statement freely and voluntarily. Â When the State asserted the\r\n  statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement as a result of\r\n  Johnsonâ€™s denying it on the stand, defense counsel argued the prejudicial\r\n  effect would outweigh the probative value of the statement and\r\n  cross-examination was not possible because Johnson had already been removed\r\n  from the proceedings.Â  Counsel further asserted:Â  â€œTheyâ€™re asking us to admit a\r\n  blanket statement that says that thereâ€™s some culpability of my client, and I\r\n  have no opportunity to test the credibility other than to ask the officers who\r\n  assisted in getting the statement.â€\r\nThe\r\n  solicitor then asserted Johnsonâ€™s statement was admissible under Rules\r\n  804(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, which permit the\r\n  admission of a statement against interest as an exception to the hearsay rule\r\n  when a witness persists in refusing to testify despite a court order to do so.Â \r\n  In response, defense counsel stated he stayed with his objection.Â  The trial\r\n  judge accepted the Stateâ€™s argument and allowed the solicitor to publish\r\n  Johnsonâ€™s statement through Captain Williams.\r\nAfter\r\n  Williams testified, the State called Kenny Kinsey, who at the time of the\r\n  incident was a sergeant in the Central Investigative Division of the Orangeburg\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  Kinsey testified he interviewed Darby after she was\r\n  arrested.Â  He also noted that although Darby initially implicated Johnson and\r\n  Terrance James as well as herself, she later revealed that Johnson and Mitchell\r\n  were her accomplices.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Kinsey claimed Terrance James â€œwas a fictitious nameâ€ that\r\n  Darby had given authorities to protect Mitchell.Â  Defense counsel then\r\n  attempted to refer to an Orangeburg telephone directory, prompting the\r\n  solicitor to request an in camera hearing.Â  During this hearing, Kinsey\r\n  explained on cross-examination that after previous attempts to locate Terrance\r\n  Johnson in Richland County proved futile and both Darby and Johnson named\r\n  Mitchell as the third participant, he did not check Orangeburg County sources, including the local telephone book, to determine if anyone by the name of\r\n  Terrance James could be found in the area.Â  Upon further cross-examination,\r\n  Kinsey acknowledged there was a directory listing for a â€œTerrance A. Jamesâ€ in Springfield, a town in Orangeburg close to the crime scene, as well as various listings\r\n  for â€œTerry Jamesâ€ and â€œT.A. Jamesâ€ in Lexington and Richland Counties.\r\nThe\r\n  solicitor argued against allowing the jury to hear evidence about the telephone\r\n  book listings, contending this was impermissible evidence of third-party guilt\r\n  that would only confuse the jury.Â  The trial judge agreed and did not allow the\r\n  defense to introduce either the telephone books or â€œany evidence that thereâ€™s\r\n  somebody somewhere named Terrance James.â€Â  The trial judge, however, did allow\r\n  defense counsel to question Kinsey about what he did and did not do during the\r\n  course of his investigation.\r\nOn\r\n  December 15, 2005, the jury convicted Mitchell of all three offenses, and the\r\n  trial judge sentenced him accordingly.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Admission of Kelvin\r\n  Johnsonâ€™s Statement\r\nMitchell\r\n  first contends the trial judge committed error in admitting the statement Johnson\r\n  made to law enforcement while in police custody.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution\r\n  requires that â€œ[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\r\n  rightÂ  . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€Â  U.S. Const.\r\n  amend. VI.Â  In South Carolina, not only is this right applicable to state\r\n  prosecutions under the Fourteenth Amendment, it is specifically mandated by the\r\n  State Constitution.Â  State v. Green, 269 S.C. 657, 661, 239 S.E.2d 485, 487\r\n  (1977) (citing S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14).\r\nIn\r\n  1987, the South Carolina Supreme Court noted the Confrontation Clause did not\r\n  prevent the use of hearsay evidence in criminal trials â€œwhere the evidence\r\n  bears significant â€˜indicia of reliability.â€™ â€Â  State v. Cooper, 291 S.C.\r\n  351, 355, 353 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1987) (quoting Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530, 539 (1986)).Â  Two years later, however, in State v. Pfirman, the court\r\n  appeared to take a decidedly more restrictive view toward allowing hearsay\r\n  evidence against a criminal defendant.Â  Under Pfirman, although a prior\r\n  inconsistent statement implicating an accused may be admitted as substantive\r\n  evidence when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to\r\n  cross-examination, â€œ[w]hen . . . the declarant refuses to admit the statement\r\n  imputed to him, the accused is denied effective cross-examination in violation\r\n  of his confrontation rights.â€Â  State v. Pfirman, 300 S.C. 84, 86, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 461, 462 (1989).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2004, the United States Supreme Court, in Crawford v. Washington, reversed\r\n  an assault and battery conviction, holding the trial court should have\r\n  suppressed a statement to law enforcement given in conjunction with the\r\n  investigation because state privilege law prevented the prosecution from\r\n  calling the declarant to testify against the defendant.Â  Although the statement\r\n  was admissible as a hearsay exception under the applicable rules of evidence,\r\n  the court held that â€œ[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue, . . . the Sixth\r\n  Amendment demands what the common law required:Â  unavailability and a prior\r\n  opportunity for cross-examination.â€Â  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 68 (2004).\r\nWe\r\n  see no reason why the rule in Crawford and similar South Carolina cases\r\n  should not apply to the present dispute.Â  Although the trial judge ultimately\r\n  ruled Johnsonâ€™s statement admissible as a statement against interest from an\r\n  unavailable declarant rather than as a prior inconsistent statement, Mitchell\r\n  had no opportunity to cross-examine Johnson about the statement because Johnson\r\n  had already been removed from the courtroom when the State moved to admit it.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues Mitchell did not preserve this issue for appeal because his trial\r\n  attorney never explicitly raised the issue of due process.Â  The State further contends\r\n  Mitchell did not adequately present a Crawford objection in his brief to\r\n  this Court.Â  We reject these arguments.\r\nThere\r\n  is persuasive authority for the Stateâ€™s position that an assignment of error\r\n  under Crawford requires more than a standard hearsay objection.Â  See Mencos v. State, 909 So. 2d 349, 351 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) (â€œAn\r\n  objection specifically based on Crawford serves to focus the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s attention on the salient inquiry required by that decision, i.e.,\r\n  whether the evidence is â€˜testimonial,â€™ whether the witness is â€˜unavailable,â€™\r\n  and whether there was a â€˜prior opportunity for cross-examination.â€™ â€) (quoting Crawford,\r\n  541 U.S. at 68).Â  Nevertheless, even though Mitchellâ€™s attorneys did not cite Crawford during trial or explain on appeal why this decision is applicable, we hold Mitchell\r\n  presented a sufficient basis for an assertion of reversible error. Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial, defense counsel argued the statement at issue was â€œa blanket statement\r\n  that thereâ€™s some culpability of my clientâ€ and he had â€œno opportunity to test\r\n  [Johnsonâ€™s] credibility.â€Â  Even without a citation to Crawford, these\r\n  assertions were sufficient to direct the trial judgeâ€™s attention to the\r\n  problems attendant to admission of an incriminating statement when the declarant\r\n  is unavailable for cross-examination by the accused.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 302-03, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (holding an objection, though not phrased â€œin the exact\r\n  terms used in the issues on appealâ€ â€œprovided a\r\n  meaningful objection with sufficient specificity to allow the trial court to\r\n  rule on the issueâ€).\r\nIn\r\n  the recent case of State v. Ladner, the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  noted that although â€œ[t]he Crawford Court declined to comprehensively\r\n  define â€˜testimonial,â€™ â€ it included within a â€œ â€˜core class of â€œtestimonialâ€\r\n  statementsâ€™ â€ (1) â€œcustodial examinationsâ€ and (2) â€œstatements that were made\r\n  under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe\r\n  the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€Â  State v. Ladner,\r\n  373 S.C. 103, 112, 644 S.E.2d 684, 688-89 (2007) (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52).Â  Here, defense counsel argued Johnsonâ€™s statement inculpated his client,\r\n  the only reasonable inference being that an objective witness would expect the\r\n  statement could be used at a later trial.\r\nWe further\r\n  hold the objections presented at trial concerning the defenseâ€™s inability to\r\n  cross-examine Johnson, together with the arguments Mitchell presented on appeal,\r\n  sufficiently preserved for our review the issue of whether he was denied his\r\n  Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.Â  See State v.McNinch, 12 \r\nS.C. 89, 96-97 (1879) (â€œBut the right to cross-examine is one which must remain \r\ninviolate. &nbsp;To take it away would render almost valueless the\r\n  constitutional right â€˜to meet the witnesses against him face to face.â€™ â€) (citing\r\n  S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 11 [now section 14]), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 69 n.5, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 n.5 (1991).Â \r\n  The State suggested during oral argument that the arguments by the defense\r\n  against admission of Johnsonâ€™s statement were presented in a context that would\r\n  have more readily suggested an assertion of prejudice than one of the loss of\r\n  the right to confront a witness. Â We hold, however, defense counselâ€™s complaint\r\n  about his inability to cross-examine Johnson were sufficient to preserve for\r\n  our review the issue of his clientâ€™s right to confront witnesses.Â  Counselâ€™s\r\n  contention that he had â€œno opportunity to test the credibility other than to\r\n  ask the officers who assisted in getting the statementâ€ went directly to the\r\n  heart of confrontation, namely, the requirement that â€œa witness . . . testify\r\n  under oath and submit to cross-examination so that the jury can observe the\r\n  witnessâ€™s demeanor and assess his credibility.â€Â  State v. Gillian, 360\r\n  S.C. 433, 449, 602 S.E.2d 62, 71 (2006).[2]\r\nFinally, we disagree with the Stateâ€™s argument that we should\r\n  uphold the admission of Johnsonâ€™s statement because Mitchellâ€™s brief to this\r\n  Court focused on a general denial of due process rather than on the specific\r\n  complaints expressed during the trial about his Sixth Amendment right of\r\n  confrontation under Crawford.Â  Although defense counsel never expressly\r\n  mentioned due process at trial, his assertions about the right to confront adverse\r\n  witnesses regarding incriminating statements raised due process concerns.Â  See Dangerfield v. State, 376 S.C. 176, ___, 656 S.E.2d 352, 354 (2008) (including\r\n  â€œthe right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnessesâ€ as one of the\r\n  requirements of â€œ[t]he procedural component of the state and federal due\r\n  process clausesâ€).\r\nThe\r\n  State further argues there was no denial of fundamental fairness because\r\n  Johnson took the stand and gave evidence favorable to Mitchell.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  As noted in Crawford, â€œ[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue, . . .\r\n  the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required:Â  unavailability and a\r\n  prior opportunity for cross-examination.â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68.Â  In the present case, although Johnson took the stand, he refused to answer the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s questions, was found in contempt, and was removed from the\r\n  courtroom while still on direct examination and before his statement was\r\n  introduced.Â  We are simply at a loss to understand how Mitchell ever had the\r\n  opportunity to cross-examine Johnson about his statement.Â  See Douglas\r\n    v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 416-19 (1965) (holding a defendantâ€™s Sixth\r\n  Amendment rights were improperly denied by allowing the prosecutor to read,\r\n  â€œunder the guise of cross-examination to refresh [the witnessâ€™s] recollectionâ€\r\n  a statement from a witness who persisted in relying on self-incrimination\r\n  grounds to avoid answering questions even after the trial court advised the\r\n  witness that such a privilege was not available); Simpkins v. State, 303\r\n  S.C. 364, 368, 401 S.E.2d 142, 143-44 (1991) (holding that admission of hearsay\r\n  testimony from a child victimâ€™s guardian ad litem unfairly denied the defendant\r\n  the right of cross examination even though the victim had testified in court); cf. State v. Blue, 717 N.W.2d 558, 566 (N.D. 2006) (â€œA witnessâ€™s mere appearance at a preliminary hearing is not an adequate\r\n  opportunity for cross-examination for purposes under the Confrontation\r\n  Clause.â€).Â  Moreover, the trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit the statement under\r\n  Rule 804 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence suggests at least a tacit\r\n  understanding that the declarant was â€œunavailable.â€\r\nFinally, the State argues any error in admitting Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  statement after his removal from the courtroom should be considered harmless.Â \r\n  In support of this argument, the State suggests that cross-examination by the\r\n  defense would have served no useful purpose, pointing out that Johnson\r\n  testified on direct examination that he had nothing to do with the crimes, that\r\n  the prosecution was threatening him to make him say things that were not true\r\n  in order to convict Mitchell, that the State had tried to brainwash him, and\r\n  that he had been forced to appear at Mitchellâ€™s trial.Â  We disagree that\r\n  Johnsonâ€™s conduct while he was on the stand warrants a finding of harmless\r\n  error.\r\nThe supreme court has recently stated that â€œ[a] violation of a\r\n  defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses is not per se reversible errorâ€ and that the appellate court â€œmust determine whether the\r\n  error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  State v. Davis, 371 S.C.\r\n  170, 181, 638 S.E.2d 57, 63 (2006).Â  The court further explained that although the\r\n  particular circumstances of a case should be considered in determining whether\r\n  an error it harmless, â€œ[e]rror is only harmless â€˜when it â€œcould not have\r\n  affected the result of the trial.â€ â€™ â€ Â Id. at 181-82, 638 S.E.2d at 63\r\n  (quoting State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151\r\n  (1986)) (internal citation omitted). Â \r\nEven if Johnsonâ€™s conduct on the stand was helpful to the defense,\r\n  the State failed to explain in its brief how his behavior and evasive answers would\r\n  inevitably lead to a determination by this Court that the admission of his\r\n  statement did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  In the\r\n  statement, Johnson did more than corroborate the Stateâ€™s allegations; he also\r\n  gave specifics about Mitchellâ€™s involvement that were not provided by any other\r\n  witnesses, including assertions that Mitchell helped to obtain the weapons used\r\n  to attack the victim and shared in the spoils of the crime.Â  We are also\r\n  concerned about the acknowledged lack of physical evidence linking Mitchell to\r\n  the incident and the fact that Darby, the only eyewitness who provided any\r\n  substantive testimony at the trial, implicated Mitchell only after authorities\r\n  confronted her about the truth of her initial statement.Â  Considering the\r\n  record as a whole, then, we cannot say that admission of Johnsonâ€™s statement could\r\n  not reasonably have affected the result of Mitchellâ€™s trial.Â  See State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 362, 543 S.E.2d 586, 596 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  (â€œIt is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole\r\n  and to ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional\r\n  violations.â€) (citing U.S. v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 509 (1983)), overruled\r\n    on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 107, 610 S.E.2d\r\n  494, 502 (2005).\r\nII.Â  Exclusion\r\n  of Evidence of Third-Party Guilt\r\nMitchell\r\n  next argues the trial judge erred in refusing to allow him to submit into\r\n  evidence telephone directories with listings similar to the name Darby\r\n  initially gave to authorities.Â  He argues this evidence was admissible because\r\n  it was probative on the issues of third-party guilt, Darbyâ€™s credibility, and\r\n  the thoroughness of the police investigation.Â  Based on the record before us, we\r\n  find no error.\r\nWe\r\n  decline to address the issue of whether the telephone directory listings were\r\n  admissible as evidence of Darbyâ€™s credibility or lack of it.Â  Defense counsel,\r\n  in arguing for admission of the directories, pointed out only that Darbyâ€™s\r\n  statements to police had been inconsistent, but never argued that admission of\r\n  the directories would affect the juryâ€™s determination as to whether she was a\r\n  believable witness.Â  Absent an argument at trial that this evidence was\r\n  necessary to impeach Darbyâ€™s overall credibility, Mitchell cannot raise this\r\n  argument on appeal.Â  See State v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305,\r\n  317, 642 S.E.2d 582, 589 (2007) (holding that, because an objection to the\r\n  exclusion of certain testimony was not made to and ruled on by the trial judge,\r\n  the issue was not preserved for appeal), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 245,\r\n  169 L. Ed. 2d 169 (2007).\r\nWe\r\n  further hold the trial judge correctly excluded the telephone books as evidence\r\n  of third-party guilt under State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532\r\n  (1941).Â  \r\nIn Gregory, the supreme court held â€œ\r\n  â€˜[e]vidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon\r\n  another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime\r\n  by another, is not admissible.â€™ â€Â  Id. at 104, 16 S.E.2d at 534 (quoting\r\n  16 C.J. 560).Â  See alsoÂ  State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 317, 652\r\n  S.E.2d 409, 416 (Ct. App. 2007) (â€œOur state supreme court has imposed strict\r\n  limitations on the admissibility of testimony indicating third-party guilt.â€).\r\nAlthough the United States Supreme Court recently addressed the\r\n  issue of the admissibility of evidence of third-party guilt in Holmes v.\r\n    South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006), that decision overruled the\r\n  application of the limits on such evidence only to the extent that these limits\r\n  rely on the prosecutionâ€™s evidence against the defendant rather than on the\r\n  strength of the evidence proffered by the defendant to establish third-party\r\n  guilt.Â  In the present case, there is nothing in the record suggesting the\r\n  trial judge even considered the strength of the Stateâ€™s evidence against\r\n  Mitchell in refusing to admit the telephone books into evidence.Â  The fact that\r\n  the directories may have contained listings of individuals with names that were\r\n  either identical or similar to the name Darby initially gave to the police is simply\r\n  not evidence that any of these individuals was involved in the incident.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we hold no prejudice resulted from the exclusion of the evidence insofar as it\r\n  was proffered to demonstrate the police were not thorough in investigating the\r\n  matter.Â  See Rule 103(a), SCRE (â€œError may not be predicated upon a\r\n  ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the\r\n  party is affected . . . .â€).Â  Although the trial judge prohibited the defense\r\n  from introducing directory listings of similarly named individuals without\r\n  evidence to connect such persons with the crime, he allowed the defense to ask\r\n  what law enforcement did and did not do in their attempt to locate Terrance\r\n  James, including whether the police checked the National Crime Information\r\n  Center records, what police did to â€œflush outâ€ Terrance James, and whether\r\n  police looked for such a person in the local area. Â We have found nothing in\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s brief explaining why this line of questioning would not be\r\n  sufficient to cover the issue of the adequacy of the police investigation.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  the trial judge committed reversible error in admitting Kelvin Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  statement to the police, Mitchellâ€™s objection to the statement and arguments on\r\n  appeal were sufficient to preserve the matter for our review, and Mitchell is\r\n  entitled to a new trial on this ground.Â  Based on the record before us, we\r\n  further hold the trial judge correctly excluded evidence submitted by the\r\n  defense of third-party guilt.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although Darbyâ€™s statement refers to her\r\n  co-participants as â€œKelvin and Terrance James,â€ there appears to be no dispute\r\n  that she was referring to Kelvin Johnson. \r\n[2]Â  The supreme court affirmed this Courtâ€™s decision in Gillian,\r\n  but modified it on grounds not related to the issues relevant to this appeal.Â  State\r\n    v.

Â The officers found Jones in the laundry room of a nearby house, and\r\n  after a brief struggle, he was subdued and apprehended.Â  The officers found a\r\n  clear plastic container that, at the time, they believed contained crack\r\n  cocaine.[1]Â \r\n  Jones was put in handcuffs and placed in the rear of Pittsâ€™ police cruiser,\r\n  while the officers began preparing the paperwork accompanying the arrest.Â  \r\nUltimately, Jones\r\n  was arrested for ten criminal and traffic offenses.[2] Â At the time he was arrested, Jones identified himself to the officers as\r\n  â€œLavaris Richardson,â€ although a Columbia Police Department officer on the\r\n  scene identified his true identity.Â  A quick check revealed Jones also had\r\n  outstanding arrest warrants for attempted burglary, assault with intent to\r\n  kill, and assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  \r\nAt some point while\r\n  the officers were working on their paperwork, Pitts and Gallegos observed Jones\r\n  fidgeting in the back seat of the cruiser.Â  Gallegos and a third deputy who had\r\n  arrived with a paddy wagon to transport Jones, Deputy Clark Frady, removed\r\n  Jones from the cruiser, and conducted a pat down search.Â  Finding nothing, they\r\n  again secured Jones in the back of the cruiser with his hands handcuffed behind\r\n  his back and his seat belt fastened.Â  Because it was an unusually warm day in\r\n  November, Pitts left the engine of the cruiser running so that the air\r\n  conditioning would be operating, and left the Plexiglas window in the cruiser\r\n  open in order to let the air reach Jones.Â  Initially, the windows of the\r\n  cruiser were also open, but the officers closed them when Jones continued to\r\n  yell out to passersby.Â  The officers then continued their paperwork on the hood\r\n  of the cruiser. Â \r\nThereafter, Jones\r\n  apparently maneuvered his handcuffed hands to the front of his body, and\r\n  squeezed through the open Plexiglas window into the driverâ€™s seat of the\r\n  cruiser, locking the doors.Â  The officers noticed Jones in the front seat when\r\n  they heard the sound of him turning the key to the already-running vehicle. Â The\r\n  officers yelled to Jones to stop and unlock the doors, and Gallegos\r\n  unsuccessfully attempted to break the front driverâ€™s side window with his\r\n  baton.Â  Gallegos then retreated to his own cruiser in anticipation of a second\r\n  pursuit, while Pitts tried to unlock the passenger side door with his key.Â  \r\nMeanwhile, Jones\r\n  had placed the cruiser in reverse and backed up approximately twenty feet.Â \r\n  Both Pitts and Frady repositioned themselves in front of the cruiser, and\r\n  shouted instructions for Jones to stop the vehicle and turn off the ignition.Â \r\n  Jones ignored these instructions, instead slumping in the driverâ€™s seat,\r\n  placing the cruiser back in drive, and eventually stepping on the accelerator.Â \r\n  The cruiser first cut left toward Pitts, who moved out of the way and fired a\r\n  shot hitting the rear hubcap.Â  The cruiser then turned and came directly at\r\n  Frady, who fired twice into the vehicle.Â  One of Fradyâ€™s shots struck Jones in\r\n  the back of the head, killing him.Â  \r\nJonesâ€™ estate brought\r\n  a wrongful death and survival action against Sheriff Leon Lott, Linn Pitts,\r\n  Gilbert Gallegos, and Clark Frady, individually and in their official\r\n  capacities with the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department, based on allegations\r\n  of negligence and civil conspiracy.Â  Defendants filed a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, which Judge Allison Lee granted with respect to all the individual\r\n  defendants, but allowed the case to proceed against Lott in his official\r\n  capacity as to the gross negligence claim.Â  The circuit court ultimately\r\n  granted Lottâ€™s motion for a directed verdict at the close of Jonesâ€™ case.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn a\r\n  motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence\r\n  and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most\r\n  favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the motions where\r\n  either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in\r\n  doubt. Â Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648\r\n  (2006). Â The appellate court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed\r\n  verdict motion only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or where the ruling is\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. at 434-35, 629 S.E.2d at 648. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJones contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in granting Lottâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the\r\n  following grounds:Â  (1) Richland County deputies had no duty to Jones with\r\n  respect to the manner in which they confined and secured him upon taking him\r\n  into custody; (2) the use of deadly force by the deputies was objectively\r\n  reasonable as a matter of law; and (3) Jonesâ€™ attempted escape outweighed any\r\n  negligence on the part of the deputies in failing to secure him.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  granted Lottâ€™s motion for directed verdict on four grounds:Â  (1) Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department deputies did not owe a duty to Jones to secure him in the back of\r\n  the police cruiser in a manner that made it impossible to escape; (2) any\r\n  negligence on the deputiesâ€™ part in securing Jones in the cruiser was\r\n  outweighed as a matter of law under our comparative negligence standard by\r\n  Jonesâ€™ actions in his escape attempt; (3) the use of deadly force by the\r\n  deputies in that situation was objectively reasonable as a matter of law; and (4)\r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department was entitled to immunity under Section 15-78-60(6) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2005) for the method of providing police protection.Â \r\n  As illustrated by Jonesâ€™ contentions on appeal listed above, Jones failed to\r\n  appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict on the issue of Lottâ€™s\r\n  immunity under section 15-78-60(6).Â  Consequently, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  on Lottâ€™s immunity is the law of the case and warrants our affirmance of the\r\n  directed verdict under the two issue rule.Â  See Anderson v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 420, 472 S.E.2d 253,\r\n  254 (1996) (finding when a general verdict can be supported by more than one\r\n  cause of action submitted to it, the appellate court will affirm unless the\r\n  appellant appeals all causes of action).Â  In Anderson, the supreme court\r\n  explained that the two issue rule is also applicable in situations not\r\n  involving a jury:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  It\r\n    should be noted that although cases generally have discussed the â€œtwo issueâ€\r\n    rule in the context of the appellate treatment of general jury verdicts, the\r\n    rule is applicable under other circumstances on appeal, including affirmance of\r\n    orders of trial courts. Â For example, if a court directs a verdict for a\r\n    defendant on the basis of the defenses of statute of limitations and\r\n    contributory negligence, the order would be affirmed under the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule\r\n    if the plaintiff failed to appeal both grounds or if one of the grounds\r\n    required affirmance.\r\n\r\nId. at 420 n.1, 472 S.E.2d at 255 n.1.Â  See also Anderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, 476 S.E.2d 475 (1996) (where a decision\r\n  is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the\r\n  appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the law\r\n  of the case); First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554,\r\n  566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding an â€œunchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is\r\n  the law of the case and requires\r\n  affirmanceâ€).\r\nMoreover, Lott\r\n  maintains on appeal that an additional sustaining ground exists under Section\r\n  15-78-60(21) of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  We agree.\r\nSection\r\n  15-78-60(21) provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from . . . the decision\r\n    to or implementation of release, discharge, parole, or furlough of any persons\r\n    in the custody of any governmental entity, including but not limited to a\r\n    prisoner, inmate, juvenile, patient, or client or the escape of these\r\n      persons.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).Â  This\r\n  argument was presented to the circuit court; however, it was not a ground upon\r\n  which the court orally granted Lottâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, this court may consider any ground present in the record to\r\n  affirm the circuit courtâ€™s judgment.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.\r\n    Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (finding when a circuit court\r\n  rules in favor of one party, it is not necessary for preservation purposes for\r\n  the winning party to ask the court to revisit its decision in order to rule on\r\n  the remaining issues and arguments it put forth).Â Â  Therefore, we find section\r\n  15-78-60(21) provides Lott immunity from the loss resulting from the escape\r\n  attempt of Jones, who, having already been arrested, was in custody and a\r\n  prisoner.\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict to Lott is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and KONDUROS,\r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Police tested and later determined the white powder\r\n  was washing detergent.\r\n[2] These included:Â  failure to use a turn signal;\r\n  leaving the scene of an accident; failure to stop for blue lights and siren;\r\n  driving without a driverâ€™s license; possession of a stolen vehicle; possession\r\n  with intent to distribute crack cocaine; unlawful carrying of a pistol;\r\n  possession of a pistol under the age of 21; resisting arrest; and possession\r\n  with intent to distribute crack cocaine within a half mile of school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4397","title":"Brown v. Brown","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4397","description":"In this appeal from family court, the husband claimed the family court erred by not finding the wife committed adultery and in turn by awarding the wife alimony.  Additionally, the husband claimed the family court erred in its disposition of certain assets and in requiring the husband to pay the wife's attorney fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, finding the husband presented direct and overwhelming circumstantial evidence to sustain his burden of proof for adultery, such that an award of alimony to the wife was improper.  The Court of Appeals also found the value of the parties' timeshare condominium should be awarded against each party equally, rather than solely against the husband, as both parties allowed it to enter into default, yet neither attempted to prevent this from occurring.  The Court also held the wife failed to show that the husband's gun collection was marital property as her testimony on its value, the date of its acquisition, and the amount of guns within the collection was speculative at best.  Lastly, the Court of Appeals remanded the award of attorney's fees to the family court for reconsideration based on the Court's findings.","date":"2008-05-28","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Thomas Lee\r\n          Brown, Appellant,\r\n        v.\r\n        Gina Marie\r\n          (Stiles) Brown, Respondent,\r\n        and\r\n        Gina Marie\r\n          (Stiles) Brown, Third Party\r\n          Plaintiff,\r\n        v.\r\n        Myron L.

Bannister, of Greenville, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Kenneth C. Porter, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this divorce action, Thomas Lee Brown (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s\r\n  failure to find Gina Marie Brown (Wife) committed adultery, thus barring her\r\n  from receiving alimony.Â  Additionally, Husband appeals the family courtâ€™s\r\n  inclusion of certain items as marital property and the assessment of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees against him.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife (collectively the Browns) married in Ohio on November 27, 1982.Â  They had five children together during their marriage.Â  In\r\n  1985, the Browns moved to Greenville, South Carolina.Â  In 1989, Husband\r\n  purchased a house with several acres of property in Travelers Rest, South Carolina, but the Browns continued to reside in a house they were renting in Greenville,   South Carolina.Â  In 1995, Husband and Wife built a new home on the\r\n  property in Travelerâ€™s Rest where they resided throughout the remainder of the\r\n  marriage.Â Â  \r\nChris Craft (Craft) sold and installed the windows in the Brownsâ€™\r\n  new home.Â  A few months later, Craft and his wife began socializing with the\r\n  Browns.Â  Around Christmas of 1996, Husband took the children to church\r\n  while Wife remained at home with their baby.Â  Husband returned home and\r\n  unexpectedly discovered Craft there. Â In explaining Craftâ€™s presence,\r\n  Wife told Husband Craft had stopped by to look at their Christmas lights.Â  \r\nWife and Craft became close and began having lunch without either\r\n  of their spouseâ€™s knowledge.Â  On several occasions, Craft and Wife met\r\n  in a remote part of a restaurantâ€™s parking lot and fondled each other in Wifeâ€™s\r\n  car.Â  In 1998, Husband discovered Craft and Wife were having lunch together.Â  After confronting Wife, she temporarily ceased contact with Craft but\r\n  admitted to subsequently resuming their relationship.Â  Additionally, Craft and\r\n  Wife frequently talked on the phone.Â  In late 2000, Husband discovered\r\n  Wife had a cell phone for which she had the bill sent to her motherâ€™s address,\r\n  and Husband testified Wife had called Craft several dozen times from Wifeâ€™s\r\n  cell phone.Â  \r\nWife admitted her relationship with Craft was sexual in nature.Â \r\n  Over the course of their relationship, Wife admitted to kissing Craft â€œa couple\r\n  of dozen times,â€ permitting him to grope her breasts, and allowing him to\r\n  fondle her genital area.Â  Wife stated she was in love with Craft and discussed\r\n  marriage with him.Â  Furthermore, Wife agreed her relationship with Craft was\r\n  â€œsexual to a degree,â€ and while not admitting to engaging in sexual\r\n  intercourse, she stated both she and Craft desired sex with each other.Â  \r\nOn November 14, 2000, Husband filed for divorce on the grounds of\r\n  adultery.Â  However, the action was\r\n  administratively dismissed, and Husband filed a new action in 2002. Â Thereafter, Wife filed an answer denying\r\n  she committed adultery and a third-party complaint against Husbandâ€™s parents.Â \r\n  Wife alleged Husbandâ€™s parents were necessary parties to the divorce action\r\n  because Husband and his parents had â€œcommon financial interests,â€ and Wife\r\n  believed they might claim an interest in a house in Husbandâ€™s name as well as\r\n  property surrounding the marital residence.Â  Pursuant to a consent order, Wifeâ€™s\r\n  action against Husbandâ€™s parents was consolidated with the divorce action.[1]Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing on the matter, the\r\n  family court found Wife had not committed adultery, but her behavior with Craft\r\n  did not aid in the preservation of the marriage.Â  The family court\r\n  further found Husbandâ€™s predilection towards online pornography did not aid in\r\n  the preservation of the marriage.Â  Â \r\nFinding Wife had never worked, the family court awarded Wife\r\n  alimony of $3,197 per month.Â  The family court found Husbandâ€™s net monthly\r\n  income was $6,136.48 with an annual earning capacity of $150,000.Â  The family\r\n  court also noted Husbandâ€™s ability to make several personal expenditures, such\r\n  as buying two expensive motorcycles and flying lessons, while he was paying\r\n  temporary unallocated support of $5,000 a month.Â  \r\nThe parties agreed Wife would retain\r\n  custody of the minor children.Â  The family court awarded Wife child\r\n  support of $1,743 per month. Â The family court equally divided the\r\n  marital property, awarding each party approximately half the value of the\r\n  marital estate.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the family court ordered Husband to pay a total of\r\n  $58,895.76 in Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, which included $27,000 previously paid\r\n  pursuant to a temporary order and $3,000 previously paid to Wife during the\r\n  pendency of the action.Â  The family court also ordered Husband pay\r\n  $5,006.50 of Wifeâ€™s expert witness fee.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered Husbandâ€™s parents to pay $5,006.50 of\r\n  Wifeâ€™s expert witness fee and $5,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When\r\n  reviewing decisions of the family court, we are cognizant of the fact the\r\n  family court had the opportunity to see the witnesses, hear â€œthe testimony\r\n  delivered from the stand, and had the benefit of that personal observance of\r\n  and contact with the parties which is of peculiar value in arriving at a\r\n  correct result in a case of this character.â€Â  DuBose v. DuBose, 259\r\n  S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972).Â  When\r\n  the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different inferences, the family\r\n  court has the duty of determining not only the law of the case, but the facts\r\n  as well, because it had\r\n  the benefit of observing the witnesses and determining how much credence to\r\n  give each witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  Anders v.\r\n    Anders, 285\r\n  S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Adultery\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in failing to\r\n  find Wife committed adultery, and thus, Wife should be barred from receiving\r\n  alimony.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  family court may not award alimony to a spouse who commits adultery before the\r\n  earliest of (1) the formal signing of a written property or marital settlement\r\n  agreement or (2) entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support\r\n  or of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement\r\n  between the parties.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nProof\r\n  of adultery as a ground for divorce must be â€œclear and positive and the\r\n  infidelity must be established by a clear preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  McLaurin v. McLaurin, 294 S.C. 132, 133, 363 S.E.2d 111, 111 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  A â€œpreponderance of the evidenceâ€ is evidence which convinces as\r\n  to its truth.Â  DuBose, 259 S.C. at 424, 192 S.E.2d at 331.Â  Because of the â€œclandestine natureâ€ of adultery, obtaining\r\n  evidence of the commission of the act by the testimony of eyewitnesses is rarely\r\n  possible, so direct evidence is not necessary to establish the charge.Â  Fulton v. Fulton, 293 S.C. 146, 147,\r\n  359 S.E.2d 88, 88 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1987).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  adultery may be proven by circumstantial evidence that establishes both a\r\n  disposition to commit the offense and the opportunity to do so.Â  Hartley v. Hartley, 292 S.C. 245, 246-47, 355 S.E.2d 869, 871 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987).Â  Generally, â€œproof\r\n  must be sufficiently definite to identify the time and place of the offense and\r\n  the circumstances under which it was committed.â€Â  Loftis v. Loftis, 284 S.C. 216, 218, 325 S.E.2d 73, 74 (Ct. App. 1985). Â Evidence placing a spouse and a third party together on several\r\n  occasions, without more, does not warrant the conclusion the spouse committed\r\n  adultery.Â  Fox v. Fox, 277 S.C. 400, 402, 288 S.E.2d 390, 391 (1982).Â  \r\nOur\r\n  courts have not specifically stated what sexual acts constitute adultery.Â  Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 104, 390 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In Nemeth v. Nemeth, 325 S.C. 480, 486,\r\n  481 S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct. App. 1997), this Court noted South Carolina has\r\n  rejected the argument equating adultery with intercourse.Â  In Nemeth,\r\n  the wife took a cruise and stayed in a cabin with a man other than her\r\n  husband.Â  Id. at 484, 481 S.E.2d at 183.Â  The wife denied she committed\r\n  adultery and introduced evidence she had chronic pain that made intercourse\r\n  difficult for her.Â  Id. at 485, 481 S.E.2d at 184.Â  This Court found\r\n  adultery, stating sexual intercourse is not required to establish adultery;\r\n  sexual intimacy is enough.Â  Id. at 486, 481 S.E.2d at 184.\r\nAdditionally, in Panhorst,\r\n  the wife was accused of adultery and sought to testify her alleged paramour was\r\n  impotent and thus was incapable of performing intercourse.Â  301 S.C. at 104,\r\n  390 S.E.2d at 378.Â  This Court found â€œher assertion\r\n  that she has first hand knowledge and experience of [her paramourâ€™s] sexual\r\n  abilities, if the family court had considered it, would have supported the\r\n  courtâ€™s finding of adultery.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn McElveen v.\r\n  McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 598, 506 S.E.2d 1, 8 (Ct. App. 1998), this Court\r\n  declined to find the wife committed adultery because â€œthere [was] virtually no\r\n  evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship between the [wife and her\r\n  paramour].â€Â  This Court noted without evidence to support a romantic\r\n  relationship, including love letters, romantic cards, hand-holding, hugging,\r\n  kissing, or any other romantic demonstrations or actions between the wife and\r\n  her paramour, adultery was not adequately established.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court\r\n  reiterated in McLaurin, 294 S.C. at 133-34, 363 S.E.2d at 111, that\r\n  circumstantial evidence indicating opportunity and inclination is sufficient to\r\n  sustain a finding of adultery.Â  In McLaurin, we affirmed the family\r\n  courtâ€™s finding the husband committed adultery when the only evidence of\r\n  adultery was the wifeâ€™s testimony that her husband admitted committing adultery\r\n  and a process serverâ€™s statement that the divorce pleadings were served on the\r\n  husband at the alleged paramourâ€™s residence where the paramour answered the door\r\n  â€œcomfortably clothed,â€ but the husband came to the door fully dressed.Â  Id. at 135, 363 S.E.2d at 112.Â  Noting the husbandâ€™s presence in the paramourâ€™s\r\n  house without more was not enough to establish adultery, this Court found the\r\n  incident was â€œsome evidence that [the husband and his paramour] had the\r\n  opportunity and dispositionâ€ to commit adultery.Â  Id.Â  \r\nHusband has the burden of proving Wife committed\r\n  adultery.Â  See McElveen,&nbsp;332 S.C. at 598, 506 S.E.2d at 8-9&nbsp;(â€œ[The]\r\n  [h]usband bore the burden at trial, as he does on appeal, of convincing the\r\n  court that [the] [w]ife committed adultery.â€).Â  While Husband is not required to\r\n  show direct evidence of the actual act, he must demonstrate Wifeâ€™s inclination\r\n  and opportunity to commit adultery.Â  Fulton, 293 S.C. at 147, 359 S.E.2d at 88.\r\nThe family court determined Wife and Craft may have had the\r\n  opportunity to commit adultery at two locations: (1) in the Brownsâ€™ home around\r\n  Christmas when Husband was at church and (2) in the car in a parking lot at\r\n  lunchtime.Â  Despite these apparent opportunities, the family court noted Wifeâ€™s\r\n  strict moral upbringing regarding sexual activity supported Wifeâ€™s position\r\n  that she and Craft had not had sexual intercourse.Â  \r\nWe agree that Craft and Wifeâ€™s presence in the Brownsâ€™ home, without\r\n  more, is not sufficient to establish adultery.Â  See Fox, 277 S.C. at 402, 288\r\n  S.E.2d at 391 (finding evidence\r\n  that a spouse and a third party were together\r\n  on several occasions, without more, does not warrant a finding of adultery).Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  we disagree with the family courtâ€™s finding that Wife and Craftâ€™s continued and\r\n  secretive meetings in various parking lots did not provide sufficient evidence\r\n  to establish an opportunity to commit adultery.Â  The family court found Craft and Wife met\r\n  approximately twenty-four times over a four to five year period.Â  While the admitted\r\n  meetings were during the daytime in a car parked in public parking lots, Wifeâ€™s\r\n  and Craftâ€™s admissions to the conduct that occurred while in the car are\r\n  circumstantial evidence that adultery was committed.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Wifeâ€™s and Craftâ€™s own admissions establish they were\r\n  inclined to commit adultery.Â  Craft testified the activities he and Wife\r\n  engaged in were sexual in nature.Â  Wife and Craft admitted that when\r\n  they would meet for lunch, they would often kiss in Wifeâ€™s car.Â  Craft\r\n  also touched Wifeâ€™s breast and removed her bra. Â Both Wife and Craft touched\r\n  one another below the waist, outside of their clothing.Â  Wife also admitted\r\n  Craft touched Wife â€œunder her pantiesâ€ once or twice.Â  Additionally, Wife stated she was in love with Craft\r\n  and that she discussed marriage with him.Â  Further, she admitted their\r\n  relationship was sexual to a degree, and she desired to have sexual intercourse\r\n  with Craft.Â  \r\nTheir\r\n  admissions to meeting for one-on-one lunches, calling each other frequently,\r\n  kissing, and fondling indicate a â€œromantic relationshipâ€ existed, which also\r\n  supports a finding of adultery.Â  Wife acknowledged she ceased talking to and\r\n  seeing Craft for a period of time after Husband confronted her, showing Wife\r\n  knew her actions were wrongful and inappropriate for a married woman.Â  While we\r\n  defer to the family court on issues of credibility, sufficient direct and\r\n  overwhelmingly circumstantial evidence is present in the record to clearly prove\r\n  Wife committed adultery.Â  The evidence here of opportunity and inclination is\r\n  too compelling to be brushed aside on the basis of Wifeâ€™s â€œstrict moral\r\n  upbringingâ€ and her claims that the romantic rendezvous always stopped short of\r\n  sexual intercourse.Â  \r\nTherefore, based on the evidence Husband presented, we\r\n  hold Husband met his burden in proving Wife committed adultery.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the family court erred in failing to find Wife committed adultery and\r\n  consequently in awarding Wife alimony.Â  \r\nII.Â  Equitable Division\r\nHusband contests several decisions of the family court\r\n  regarding the distribution of the marital estate, specifically the assessment\r\n  of the value of the partiesâ€™ timeshare solely against Husband and the family\r\n  courtâ€™s determinations that a backhoe and a gun collection were marital\r\n  property.Â  We address each argument in turn. \r\nMarital\r\n  property includes all real and personal property the parties acquired during\r\n  the marriage and owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital\r\n  litigation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2007).Â  The\r\n  ultimate goal of apportionment is to divide the marital estate, as a whole, in\r\n  a manner which fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to the economic\r\n  partnership and also the effect on each of the parties of ending that\r\n  partnership.Â  Johnson v. Johnson,296 S.C. 289, 298, 372 S.E.2d 107, 112 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988). Â The division of marital\r\n  property is within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617\r\n  S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005).Â  The appellate court looks to the overall fairness of the\r\n  apportionment.Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThe\r\n  doctrine of equitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is,\r\n  among other things, an economic partnership.â€Â  Mallett\r\n    v. Mallett,323 S.C. 141, 150,\r\n  473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œUpon dissolution of the marriage, property acquired during\r\n  the marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly\r\n  reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, regardless of which\r\n  spouse holds legal title.â€Â  Id.\r\nA.Â \r\n  Timeshare\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in assessing the entire value of the Hilton Head timeshare\r\n  against him because it found he was at fault in allowing the timeshare to go\r\n  into default.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Browns owned a Hilton Head timeshare valued at $27,500 at the\r\n  commencement of the divorce proceedings.Â  However, the timeshare had\r\n  gone into default by the time of the divorce decree.Â  The family court\r\n  found no credible evidence of an outstanding mortgage and stated Husband\r\n  allowed the â€œtimeshare to go into default quite possibly for spite.â€\r\nFor\r\n  purposes of equitable distribution, marital property is typically valued at the time of the\r\n  commencement of the marital litigation.Â  Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C.\r\n  141, 151, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Often, â€œthe value of marital\r\n  assets . . . change, sometimes substantially, between the time the action was\r\n  commenced and its final resolution.â€Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C.\r\n  222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œ[B]oth\r\n  parties are entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation that occurs\r\n  to marital property after separation but before divorce.â€Â  Arnal v. Arnal,&nbsp;363\r\n  S.C. 268, 293, 609 S.E.2d 821, 834&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, this Court\r\n  has previously held when one party is at fault in causing the diminishment in\r\n  value of the property, that depreciation may be assessed against the at-fault\r\n  party.Â  Dixon, 334 S.C. at 228, 512 S.E.2d at 542.Â  \r\n In the present case, both parties were at fault in the\r\n  time shareâ€™s diminishment in value.Â  Both knew the payment was due and refused\r\n  to pay.Â  The temporary order was silent as to who was responsible for the\r\n  payments.Â  Either party could have sought the family courtâ€™s assistance in\r\n  determining which party should pay.Â  Both Husband and Wife had the ability to\r\n  pay because Wife was receiving temporary unspecified support at the time the\r\n  payment was due.Â  Accordingly, both were at fault in allowing the timeshare to\r\n  fall into foreclose, and the family court erred in assessing the value of the\r\n  timeshare solely against Husband instead of equally against both parties.\r\nB.Â \r\n  Backhoe\r\nHusband maintains the family\r\n  court erred in including a John Deere backhoe as marital property and including\r\n  it in Husbandâ€™s distribution because Husbandâ€™s company actually owned the\r\n  backhoe.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  burden to show property is not subject to equitable distribution is upon the\r\n  one claiming that property acquired during the marriage is not marital.Â  Brandi\r\n    v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 356, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In the\r\n  instant case, Husband failed to sustain his burden of proving the backhoe was\r\n  non-marital property.Â  While Husband claimed the backhoe belonged to his\r\n  company, the receipt for the backhoe was in his name instead of the companyâ€™s\r\n  name.Â  Further, the backhoe was not listed on the companyâ€™s tax returns, and\r\n  the company had not taken depreciation on the backhoe. Â Husband provided\r\n  no documentation the backhoe belonged to the company, and the backhoe was even\r\n  parked at the Brownsâ€™ residence.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not\r\n  err in finding the backhoe constituted marital property.Â  See Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 89, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756-57 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) (holding equipment purchased using marital funds that was listed on\r\n  coupleâ€™s joint tax return was marital property despite exclusive use at\r\n  husbandâ€™s business).Â  \r\nC.Â \r\n  Gun Collection\r\nHusband contends\r\n  the family court erred in finding Husband acquired guns during the marriage\r\n  with a total value of $12,500 because Wife presented insufficient evidence to\r\n  identify the guns, their value, and their marital character.Â  We agree. \r\nâ€œ[A]\r\n  spouse claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the\r\n  marriage has the burden of proving the property is part of the marital\r\n  estate.â€Â  Carroll v. Carroll,&nbsp;309 S.C. 22, 26, 419 S.E.2d 801,\r\n  803&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992).\r\nWife\r\n  testified Husband owned ten or fourteen guns.Â  She further testified Husband\r\n  told her the entire collection of guns was worth approximately $15,000.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Wife could not name any of the guns but testified\r\n  â€œthere were a couple, though, that he had gotten after we were married.â€Â  She\r\n  further testified Husband received a collection of guns from his father before\r\n  they married.Â  Wife testified she did not know how much Husband paid for the\r\n  guns bought during the marriage.\r\nWife had the burden\r\n  of showing the guns were marital property.Â  Her testimony was vague regarding\r\n  how many guns Husband owned and acquired during the marriage and gave no\r\n  indication of the value of the guns obtained during the marriage.Â  She simply\r\n  gave an estimate for the entire collection as told to her by Husband several\r\n  years ago.Â  We find this testimony alone is insufficient to establish Husband\r\n  had acquired guns during the marriage or to specifically indicate their value.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the family court erred in including Husbandâ€™s gun collection in\r\n  the marital estate. \r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, Husband\r\n  asserts the family court erred in ordering Husband to pay all of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees because Wifeâ€™s conduct caused the fees to be excessive.Â  In\r\n  light of our decision to reverse the family courtâ€™s finding on the adultery and\r\n  equitable distribution issues, we similarly reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and remand the issue for reconsideration.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton,\r\n  310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993) (reversing and remanding issue of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees for reconsideration when the substantive results achieved by\r\n  trial counsel were reversed on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court\r\n  erred in failing to find Wife committed adultery because Husband met his burden\r\n  of proving Wife had both the inclination and the opportunity to commit adultery\r\n  such that an award of alimony to Wife was improper.Â  Further, the family court\r\n  erred in assessing the value of the timeshare solely against Husband when both\r\n  parties were equally at fault in allowing it to enter into default.Â \r\n  Conversely, the family court did not err in determining the backhoe was marital\r\n  property because the Husband failed to prove it was non-marital property.Â \r\n  Further, the family court erred in classifying Husbandâ€™s gun collection as\r\n  marital property because Wife did not meet her burden in proving the guns were\r\n  marital property.Â  In light of these decisions, we modify the family courtâ€™s distribution\r\n  of the marital estate to be consistent with this opinion.Â  Further, we reverse\r\n  and remand the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees against Husband for reconsideration.Â \r\n  Therefore, the order of the family court isÂ Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.[2]\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Following\r\n  the final hearing, the family court found Husbandâ€™s parents had no interest in\r\n  the house.Â  Husbandâ€™s parents\r\n  appealed this decision and the family courtâ€™s assessment of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  against them in a separate appeal.Â  Brown v.
