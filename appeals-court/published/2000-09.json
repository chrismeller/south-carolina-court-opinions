Geraldine Abraham, et al. (collectively\r\n\"Employees\") appeal.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 1981, the General Assembly established a \"special statewide unified school district\" within the Department of Corrections\r\nknown as Palmetto Unified School District No. 1.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-25-10 (1989).  The District, designed to  \"enhance\r\nthe quality and scope\" of inmate education with an eye toward reintegrating offenders into the community, operates under the\r\ncontrol of a Board of Trustees supervised by the Department of Corrections. Id. at Â§ 24-25-20;\r\nsee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-25-40\r\n(1989 &amp; Supp. 1999).  In establishing the District, the Legislature specifically provided for a \"twelve-month school program\r\n[with] teachers' pay schedule based on the state and average school supplement pay scales.\"  S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 24-25-70(7)\r\n(1989 &amp; Supp. 1999).  The Legislature further required that teachers hired to work in the District \"be employed, supervised,\r\nand terminated\" according to the policies and procedures of the Department of Corrections.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-25-90\r\n(1989).\r\n\r\nEmployees are all current or former educators working as teachers in the South Carolina correctional system.  On September\r\n25, 1995, Employees filed a complaint, amended on October 12, alleging Employers failed to compensate them as provided by\r\nlaw. (1) Employees subsequently moved for summary judgment on December 11, 1996;\r\nthe trial court denied the motion on\r\nFebruary 24, 1998. Thereafter, on March 20, Employers filed a motion for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the trial\r\ncourt granted their motion, finding Employees \"can prove no set of facts that would entitle them to any relief.\" Pursuant to\r\nRule 59(e), SCRCP, Employees filed a timely motion to reconsider. On March 17, 1999, the trial court issued an amended\r\norder confirming summary judgment to Employers. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nA motion for summary judgment should be granted when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Adamson v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 332 S.C. 121, 503\r\nS.E.2d 752 (Ct. App. 1998).  In particular, summary judgment is appropriate where the facts of the case are undisputed.\r\nSee\r\n Trico Surveying, Inc. v. Godley Auction Co., 314 S.C. 542, 544, 431 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1993) (\"Summary judgment can be\r\ngranted when plain, palpable and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.\") (quoting\r\nByerly v.\r\nConnor, 307 S.C. 441, 445, 415 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1992)); Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 331 S.C. 192, 500 S.E.2d 160 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998).  The parties herein concede no issues of material fact exist. Accordingly, the questions presented for this Court's\r\ndetermination involve the purely legal concern of whether Employees are in fact paid according to law.\r\n\r\nI.  Twelve-Month Work Schedule\r\n\r\nEmployees first argue they are not paid as required by law because Employers have failed to compensate them for their twelve-month work schedule.  Employees, who by the terms of their employment agree to teach five days a week year-round, claim\r\nEmployers are improperly deducting holidays and annual leave from the number of work days for which they must account. \r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nThe total number of days available for Employees to work in any given year is 261 (365 total days per year minus 104 weekend\r\ndays each year).  Employers calculate Employee pay based on the fact that, of this total, Employees must be present physically\r\non the job for 235 days each year (261 work days minus 15 days of annual leave plus 11 official state holidays).  Employees\r\ncontend this method of determining compensation means they are not getting paid for 26 days of \"work\" time that must be\r\naccounted for (either by annual leave or an official holiday).  Employees' argument, however, misapprehends the nature of\r\ntheir base pay determination.\r\n\r\nWhen the District initially was formed, the 235-day figure was used to compute Employees' annual compensation because \"[i]t\r\nwas the ratio of Palmetto Unified School District's accountable years and work days to the ratio of the geographic district\r\nteachers' work year and work days within that work year.\"  In other words, the ratio of days actually worked by Employees\r\n(235 out of a possible 261 days available in a 52- week work year) is exactly the same as that for public school teachers (190\r\ndays out of 210 available in a 42-week work year).  Regarding the comparison to public school teachers, Employers' expert\r\nCarl Garris noted:\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm saying that there's three ways you can look at it.  But in any event, you've got . . . your measuring rod has to be the same. \r\nYou've got to compare apples to apples or oranges to oranges.  If you want to talk about . . . base it on work days, the ratio is\r\n190 to 235.  If you want to talk about the total period of time in which they are required to carry out their work, then the\r\ncomparison is 210 days to 26[1] days.  If you want to base it on weeks, it's 42 weeks versus 52 weeks, and under all three\r\nscenarios, the ratio comes out to be 124 percent.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(Garris Dep. at 37).\r\n\r\nAnother expert, Dr. Jesse Teel, reached a similar conclusion:\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Corrections teachers work 235 days per year, which is 124 percent of the 190 day work year that South Carolina\r\npublic school teachers perform.  Additionally, Department . . . teachers['] base pay is approximately 124 percent of base pay for\r\n. . . public school teachers with the same credentials and experience.  Further, both Department . . . teachers and public school\r\nteachers are not required to work on holidays when their respective schools are closed . . . and neither group's pay is reduced\r\nfor not working these holidays as would be the case with hourly workers . . . .  Last, Department . . . teachers receive 15 days of\r\nvacation time each year, and their pay is not reduced for not working these days.  In fact, Department . . . teachers can accrue\r\nup to 45 vacation days and be paid for these days if they leave the Department of Corrections.  This obviously implies that they\r\nalready receive pay for their vacation days.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(Teel Aff. at 3-4).  Finally, Sam O'Kelley, Deputy Director of Administration for the Department of Corrections, confirmed the\r\ntestimony of both experts:\r\n\r\n\r\n[I]t was a way of generating the pay schedule.  In effect, what we did is we took the State [public school teacher] minimum,\r\nwhich was based on 190 days, got the daily rate of pay, and then simply multiplied that figure by 235 and that would have\r\ngiven us the annualized equivalent . . . .  \r\n\r\n\r\n(O'Kelley Dep. at 11).  \r\n\r\nWithout question, Employees are paid semi-monthly (twenty-four times a year) on an annual, salaried basis.  (Coleman Dep. at\r\n69.)  In other words, Employees agree to \"perform a job with certain responsibilities for a specified dollar amount over a period\r\nof time,\" in this case one year.  (Garris Dep. at 30.) Accordingly, they are paid the same amount each pay period regardless of\r\nwhether they have taken annual leave or an official holiday.  (Coleman Dep. at 70; Strawhorn Dep. at 46.) Because Employees\r\nare compensated at a rate that is 124% of public teacher salaries for working a schedule that is 24% longer, we find no merit in\r\ntheir assertion of pay inequity.  We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment on this issue.\r\n\r\nII.  Breach of Contract\r\n\r\nEmployees next argue Employers' alleged violations of their statutory rights to compensation based on a twelve-month\r\nschedule, state mandatory minimum salary, and entitlement to annual leave constitute a breach of contract.  Because Employees \r\nfailed to prove the existence of any contracts of employment, this issue is\r\nmeritless.  \r\n\r\nUnlike public school teachers, teachers within the Department of Corrections do not operate under written employment\r\ncontracts.  Employees, however, assert the absence of written contracts does not deprive them \"of contractual rights based in\r\nunequivocal policy and mandatory law.\"  While this indeed may be true, Employees must still carry their burden of producing\r\nevidence of employment contracts, either express or implied.  See \r\nPrescott v. Farmers Telephone Co-op., Inc., 335 S.C. 330,\r\n336,  516 S.E.2d 923, 926 (1999) (\"In order to prove the existence of a definite contract of employment, the employee must\r\nestablish all of the elements of a contract.\").\r\n\r\nEmployees contend various statutory provisions governing compensation, salary adjustments, and annual leave evidence\r\ncontracts of employment with Employers.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nIn Alston v. City of Camden, 322 S.C. 38, 45, 471 S.E.2d 174, 177 (1996), our supreme court stated that \"South Carolina law is\r\nclear that public employees generally have no contractual rights in their employment merely by virtue of a statute describing\r\nthe terms of that employment.\" (2)  Furthermore, the court explained, there is a presumption in this state \"that statutes regulating\r\nsalaries and benefits of public employees do not create contractual rights for the employees whose salaries and benefits the\r\nstatutes set.\" Id.  Finally, the court cited the general rule applicable when analyzing whether a private contract arises from\r\nstatutory law:  \"[A]bsent some clear indication that the legislature intends to bind itself contractually, the presumption is that 'a\r\nlaw is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature\r\nshall ordain otherwise.'\" Id. at 46, 471 S.E.2d at 178 (quoting\r\nDodge v. Board of Educ., 302 U.S. 74, 79 (1937)).  As none of\r\nthe statutes cited by Employees evidences any intent by the General Assembly to create contractual rights therein, we must\r\npresume they are mere declarations of governmental policy rather than codifications of vested rights giving rise to private\r\ncauses of action.  Accordingly, because Employees failed to prove any contracts of employment with Employers, the trial court\r\ndid not err in granting summary judgment to Employers on this issue. (3)\r\n\r\nIII.  Section 24-25-70(7)\r\n\r\nNext, Employees assert the trial court erred in failing to find the express terms of Â§ 24-25-70(7) require Employers to pay them\r\na salary supplement based on the statewide school district average in addition to the state mandatory minimum salary.  Enacted\r\nin 1981, section 24-25-70 directs the District's governing Board to discharge the following administrative function:  \r\n\r\n\r\n[E]stablish a twelve-month school program and teachers' pay schedule based on the state and average school supplement pay\r\nscales[.]  \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-25-70(7) (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999). (4)  Employees do not dispute that Employers base their pay schedules on\r\nthe state minimum as prescribed by law.  Rather, Employees assert Â§ 24-25-70(7) also imposes on Employers a requirement to\r\npay them a salary supplement based on the \"average school supplement.\"  We agree.\r\n\r\nInitially, we believe a brief explication of how public school teachers in the state are paid will be helpful to our analysis.  Public\r\neducation in South Carolina is funded with resources from the federal, state, and local governments.  See \r\nAbbeville County\r\nSch. Dist. v. State, 335 S.C. 58, 515 S.E.2d 535 (1999).  State funds are disseminated primarily through two mechanisms\r\nestablished by the General Assembly:  the Education Finance Act of 1977 (EFA) and the 1984 Education Improvement Act\r\n(EIA). See  id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-10\r\net seq. (1990 &amp; Supp. 1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 59-21-420 to -450 (1990 &amp; Supp.\r\n1999).\r\n\r\nThe EFA mandates a statewide minimum salary schedule for certified instructional personnel.  Richland County Sch. Dist. Two\r\nv. South Carolina Dep't of Educ., 335 S.C. 491, 517 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1999);\r\nsee S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 59-20-10\r\net seq. (1990\r\n&amp; Supp. 1999).  To accomplish this goal, the EFA distributes monies to public school districts using a \"wealth-sensitive\"\r\nformula, which results in poorer districts receiving proportionately more state funding than wealthier ones.\r\nSee  Abbeville\r\nCounty, 335 S.C. at 64, 515 S.E.2d at 538; Richland County v. Campbell, 294 S.C. 346, 364 S.E.2d 470 (1988).\r\nFunds under\r\nthe EIA, on the other hand, are distributed without regard to a district's tax base.\r\nAbbeville County, 335 S.C. at 64, 515 S.E.2d\r\nat 538.  In effect, the EIA amended the EFA to provide additional state funds to school districts in order to raise public teacher\r\nsalaries to the southeastern average. See \r\nRichland County Sch. Dist. Two, 335 S.C. at 497, 517 S.E.2d at 448; S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 59-20-50(4)(b) (1990 &amp; Supp. 1999).  As noted by Employers'  expert Carl Garris, the EFA and EIA now operate in tandem\r\nto establish the \"state minimum\" salary for public school teachers.  (Garris Dep. at 51, 53).\r\n\r\nMany school districts, however, augment the required state minimum salary with additional \"local supplements.\"  Such\r\nsupplements, clearly voluntary and thus  contingent upon each district's local tax base, are utilized to meet a particular district's\r\nneeds, i.e., attracting teachers with specific qualifications or retaining those with valuable experience.\r\nSee  Richland County\r\nSch. Dist. Two, 335 S.C. at 493, 517 S.E.2d at 446 (\"Teacher's [sic] salaries now contain a combination of EFA funds, EIA\r\nfunds, and optional local salary supplements.\") (emphasis added).  In any event, it is important to note that \"for every dollar a\r\nschool district increases their local salary supplement, the EIA funds provided by the [s]tate decrease by an equal dollar\r\namount.\" Id. at 497-98, 517 S.E.2d at 448.  In other words, \"[a] teacher's [minimum] salary is now computed by adding (a) the\r\nEFA base salary amount, (b) the local salary supplements, and (c) then using the EIA funds as a plug to ensure the total\r\nteacher's salary equates with the southeastern average.\" Id.  As a result, some wealthier school districts receive no EIA funds\r\nbecause they pay supplements which raise teacher salaries well above the southeastern average/state minimum.  It is these\r\nsupplemental funds which are at issue in this case.\r\n\r\nEmployers argue, and the trial court found, that the statutory language \"average school supplement\" does not entitle Employees\r\nto an additional amount above and beyond the state salary minimum for teachers.  Instead, the court held the phrase \"average\r\nschool supplement\" actually refers to \"the mandatory local portion of the EFA base salary\" (which is, of course, included in the\r\nstate minimum), rather than the discretionary supplements from individual school districts described above.  According to the\r\ncourt and Employers, \"[b]y specifying both 'state and average supplement pay scales,' the General Assembly was trying to\r\nexplicitly require the DOC and District to pay their teachers both portions of the EFA teacher pay schedule.\"  This construction\r\nis simply untenable.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed the legislature included the words \"state\" and \"average school supplement\" for a reason; if \"average school\r\nsupplement\" merely refers to the \"local portion\" of the EFA-mandated state minimum salary requirement, its use in Â§ 24-25-70(7) would be superfluous.  It is well settled, however, that statutes \"should be so construed that no word, clause, sentence,\r\nprovision or part shall be rendered surplusage, or superfluous.\" Pike v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 332 S.C. 605, 618,\r\n506 S.E.2d 516, 523 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Matter of Decker, 322 S.C. 215, 219, 471 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1995)).  Moreover,\r\ngiven that construction, the phrase as used in Â§ 24-25-70(7) seemingly would require Employers to contribute \"locally-generated\" funds to Employees' salaries, a patent absurdity.  The District, as part of the Department of Corrections, clearly has\r\nno tax base from which to generate revenue, and this Court will not render an interpretation which leads to such an illogical\r\nconclusion. See  Ray Bell Constr. Co., Inc. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998)\r\n(stating that courts ordinarily will reject a proposed statutory meaning \"when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly\r\nabsurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention\") (quoting\r\nKiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)).  Finally, use of the plural\r\n\"scales\" evidences an intention that teacher pay in the District should be based on two separate pay schedules, a \"state\" pay\r\nscale and an \"average school supplement\" pay scale. See \r\nEmerson Elec. Co. v. Wasson, 287 S.C. 394, 397, 339 S.E.2d 118,\r\n120 (1986) (\"The legislature's use of the plural 'taxpayers' instead of 'taxpayer' indicates that corporations filing consolidated\r\nreturns are not to be considered a single entity.\").\r\n\r\nIn construing a statute, our primary goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.  Jackson v. Charleston\r\nCounty Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 447 S.E.2d  859 (1994); Gilstrap v. S.C. Budget and Control Board, 310 S.C. 210, 423 S.E.2d\r\n101 (1992).  Each provision, therefore, \"should be given a reasonable construction[] consistent with the purpose and policy of\r\nthe Act.\" Jackson, 316 S.C. at 181, 447 S.E.2d at 861;\r\nGardner v. Biggart, 308 S.C. 331, 417 S.E.2d 858 (1992).  Legislative\r\nintent \"should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.\"\r\nRichland County Sch. Dist. Two, 335 S.C. at\r\n496, 517 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 339, 478 S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a primary rule of statutory interpretation is that \"words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\nresort to a subtle or forced construction which limits or expands the statute's operation.\"  Adkins v. Varn, 312 S.C. 188, 191,\r\n439 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1993); see \r\nRichland County Sch. Dist. Two, 335 S.C. at 496, 517 S.E.2d at 447.  Thus, when a statute\r\ncontains \"clear and unambiguous\" terms, this Court \"must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.\"\r\nAdkins, 312\r\nS.C. at 191, 439 S.E.2d at 824; see also \r\nCitizens for Lee County, Inc. v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 28, 416 S.E.2d 641, 644\r\n(1992) (\"In construing statutes, the terms used therein must be taken in their ordinary and popular meaning.\").\r\n\r\nWe agree with Employees that the plain language of \"teachers' pay schedule based on the state and average school supplement\r\npay scales\" means that, in addition to the state mandatory minimum, Employees are entitled to additional compensation equal\r\nto the mathematical average of all salary supplements paid by school districts across the state.  Such a construction comports\r\nwith statutory provisions guaranteeing teachers who are state employees but not employed by a particular school district a\r\nsalary adjusted to reflect the salary schedules of the surrounding school districts.See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-25-50 (1990)\r\n(\"Each state agency shall receive such funds as are required to adjust the pay of all certified instructional personnel to the\r\nappropriate salary provided by the salary schedules of the surrounding school districts . . . .\"); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-11-271\r\n(1986) (\"The salary structure for [certified] employees at the South Carolina School for the Deaf and Blind . . . shall be on the\r\nbasis of comparable daily compensation with the school district with which the School for the Deaf and Blind competes for\r\ninstructional personnel.\").  Presumably, the legislature intended the combination of the state minimum and average school\r\nsupplement pay scales as a similar guarantee so that Employees, like their colleagues at other state agencies, would be paid in a\r\nmanner comparable to public school teachers in the \"surrounding\" (and in the case of District \"statewide\") school districts. (5)\r\n\r\nBecause we find Â§ 24-25-70(7) authorizes additional compensation to Employees based on an  average of these local school\r\nsupplements, which Employers admit has not been paid, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand this issue to\r\nthe trial court for a determination of appropriate back pay consistent with this opinion.  See \r\nJohnson v. Spartanburg County\r\nSch. Dist. No. 7, 314 S.C. 340, 444 S.E.2d 501 (1994) (affirming reinstatement of assistant principal and remanding to the trial\r\ncourt for a calculation of back pay and appropriate allowances).\r\n\r\nIV.  Payment of Wages Act\r\n\r\nEmployees further contend that Employers' \"[w]ithholding [of] compensation  for scheduled work days and deduction of 15\r\nleave days per year violates the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.\"  We disagree.  \r\n\r\n&quot;[T]he South Carolina Payment of Wages Act is remedial legislation designed to protect working people and assist them in\r\ncollecting compensation wrongfully withheld.\" Dumas v. InfoSafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 194, 463 S.E.2d 641, 645 (Ct. App.\r\n1995) (emphasis added).  Because we have already determined Employers' 235-day pay schedule for Employees is appropriate,\r\nthe trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue.\r\n\r\nV.  \"Total Compensation Package\"\r\n\r\nFinally, Employees argue the trial court erred in concluding, as an alternative basis for summary judgment, that their \"total\r\ncompensation package\" exceeded any amounts to which they allegedly were entitled, thereby \"further illuminat[ing] the\r\nequities of [the] case\" and convincing the court that Employees' compensation \"has been dealt with legally, equitably and in\r\ngood faith\" by Employers.    \r\n\r\nIn its amended order, the trial court found that \"the value of the benefits currently being provided to [Employees] more than\r\ncompensates them for the difference [in pay] they claim entitlement to.\"  The court went on to note that such benefits as annual\r\nleave, paid holidays, sick leave, salaries tied to certain \"cell levels\" or levels of experience and the mandatory Southeastern\r\nschoolteacher average, and participation in the Police Officers' Retirement System indicate Employees have \"ended up with the\r\nbest of both worlds in terms of benefits.\"  Therefore, the court reasoned, Employees \"cannot complain that they have been\r\nunfairly compensated\" by Employers. \r\n\r\nWe agree with Employees that these benefits do not relieve Employers of their obligation to pay Employees according to law\r\nand clearly are irrelevant to any determination of Employees' entitlement to compensation particulars provided for by statute. \r\nMoreover, nothing in the overall legislative scheme governing teacher pay in the District permits such a set-off against\r\nEmployees' salaries.  Accordingly, summary judgment on this issue is reversed.  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the grant of summary judgment to Employers is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., concur.    \r\n\r\n\r\n1. By consent, various plaintiffs were added and/or deleted in orders filed in August 1997, and March and November 1998. \r\n2.\r\n Employees' reliance on Armstrong v. Sch. Dist. Five of Lexington and Richland Counties, 26 F. Supp.2d 789 (D.S.C. 1998),\r\nto support their assertion that Alston is inapplicable is misplaced.  In\r\nArmstrong, the plaintiffs were public school teachers\r\noperating under written contracts of employment, a fact the Armstrong court noted in its opinion.\r\nSee  id. at 795 (\"[U]nlike the\r\nPlaintiffs here, the Alston employees had no employment contracts and no statute which required the issuance of contracts.\").  \r\n3.\r\n We note here that the trial court, in summarily rejecting Employees' breach of contract claims, primarily relied upon the\r\nvalidity of the disclaimer in the Department of Correction's employee handbook.  On appeal, however, Employees do not argue\r\nthe handbook gave rise to any contracts of employment.  Employees, therefore, have now abandoned the handbook argument.\r\nSee, e.g., First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (issues not argued in the appellate briefs are deemed\r\nabandoned).  Furthermore, even if they had not abandoned the handbook theory, we would be unable to address it as\r\nEmployees failed to include the entire handbook in the record on appeal. See \r\nFleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 464, 450\r\nS.E.2d 589, 596 (1994) (\"[T]he disclaimer is merely one factor to consider in ascertaining whether the handbook as a whole\r\nconveys credible promises that should be enforced. . . .  Thus, . . . the entire handbook, including any disclaimer, should be\r\nconsidered in determining whether the handbook gives rise to a promise, an expectation and a benefit.\") (quoting Stephen F.\r\nBefort, Employee Handbooks and the Legal Effect of Disclaimers, 13 Indus. Rel. L.J. 326, 375-76 (1991-92));Crestwood Golf\r\nClub, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 493 S.E.2d 826 (1997) (appellant bears the burden of providing the appellate court with a\r\nsufficient record to review any assertions of error).    \r\n4.\r\n   This provision remained without modification in 1993 when the Department of Corrections became a cabinet agency.See\r\nS.C. Ann. Â§ 24-25-70(7) (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999).  \r\n5.\r\n Employers also proffer several \"considerations\" which they claim support the decision to not pay Employees a salary\r\nsupplement:  a number of school districts do not pay the optional local supplement; the District does not have an independent\r\ntax base from which to draw financial support; the legislature did not specifically appropriate funds to the District to pay for\r\nsalary supplements; the Department of Education has never cited the District during the course of numerous audits for failing to\r\npay such supplements.  None of these rationales, however, absolves Employers of their duty to pay Employees as section 24-25-70(7) directs.\r\nSee, e.g., Hatchett v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 244 S.C. 425, 431-32, 137 S.E.2d 608, 611 (1964) (\"The\r\nresponsibility for the justice or wisdom of legislation rests with the Legislature, and it is the province of the courts to construe,\r\nnot to make, the laws.\") (quoting Laird v.

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1994, Bruce Hawkins was driving a car owned by his parents, Tony and Ruby Hawkins (the\r\n\r\nHawkinses) when he was involved in a collision with a vehicle insured by Unisun.  At the time of the\r\n\r\naccident, Bruce was living with the Hawkinses.  Because the Hawkinses failed to carry insurance on their\r\n\r\ncar at the time of the accident, Unisun was forced to pay its insured's losses under the uninsured motorist\r\n\r\nprovision of its policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 3, 1997, Unisun filed a claim against Bruce and the Hawkinses  alleging negligence and a\r\n\r\nviolation of the South Carolina Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act, respectively. (1)  \r\n  On October 4,\r\n\r\n1997, four days before the statute of limitations ran, Unisun served all three defendants at the Hawkinses'\r\n\r\nresidence.  At the time of service, however, Bruce no longer resided with his parents.  Unisun neither\r\n\r\nserved Bruce at his current home nor ever served him personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBruce and the Hawkinses filed an answer collectively.  As a third defense, the answer averred: \"Plaintiffs\r\n\r\nhave failed to serve defendant Bruce Hawkins within the three year statute of limitations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 20, 1998, all three defendants moved for summary judgment.   Bruce moved for summary\r\n\r\njudgment on the ground that Unisun failed to serve him within the statute of limitations period.  Bruce\r\n\r\nargued that any attempted service on him prior to the running of the statute of limitations failed to comply\r\n\r\nwith Rule 4, SCRCP, and thus was insufficient.  Because the statute of limitations ran after the initial,\r\n\r\ninsufficient service attempt, Bruce contended Unisun failed to timely serve him prior to the running of the\r\n\r\nstatute of limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hawkinses argued that because their liability was derivative of Bruce's liability, and Bruce was not\r\n\r\nserved within the statute of limitations, they could not be held liable.   Additionally, the Hawkinses moved\r\n\r\nfor summary judgment on the ground that the only cause of action pled by Unisun against them was the\r\n\r\nFinancial Responsibility Act, which provides no private cause of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted both Bruce's and the Hawkinses' motions for summary judgment.  The court found\r\n\r\nthat Unisun failed to accomplish proper service on Bruce by either delivering the summons and complaint\r\n\r\nto him personally or by leaving a copy at his \"usual place of abode\" in accordance with Rule 4(d), SCRCP. (2) \r\n\r\nIn addition, the court specifically found Bruce had adequately pled non-service as well as the running of\r\n\r\nthe statute of limitations in defense to Unisun's claims. (3)  As to the Hawkinses, the trial court found\r\n\r\nUnisun failed to state a cause of action under the family purpose doctrine or a theory of negligent\r\n\r\nentrustment.  Finally, the court held no independent cause of action exists for a violation of the Financial\r\n\r\nResponsibility Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisun asserts the trial court erred in finding that Bruce was not served within the statute of limitations\r\n\r\nperiod because he waived the right to contest the sufficiency of service of process by failing to properly\r\n\r\nchallenge service under Rule 12(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 12(b), SCRCP, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery defense . . . to a cause of action in any pleading . . . shall be asserted in the responsive pleading\r\n\r\nthereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by\r\n\r\nmotion: . . . (5) insufficiency of service of process . . . .  A motion making any of these defenses shall be\r\n\r\nmade before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rule 12(h)(1), SCRCP, expressly provides that the defense of  insufficiency of service of\r\n\r\nprocess is waived \"if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or\r\n\r\nan amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Garner v. Houck, 312 S.C. 481, 435 S.E.2d 847 (1993), our supreme court held that a party who fails to\r\n\r\nproperly raise the defense of insufficient service of process under Rule 12 waives any issues or defenses\r\n\r\nregarding service, including a statute of limitations defense.  See also James F. Flanagan,  South Carolina\r\n\r\nCivil Procedure 100 (2d ed. 1996) (\"The . . . waiver provision affects not only the motion itself, but any\r\n\r\nargument based on the alleged defect.\").  Because Bruce's statute of limitations claim is inextricably tied to\r\n\r\nthe attempted service on him, the dispositive issue on appeal is  whether Bruce's objection to the\r\n\r\nsufficiency of service was properly pled, thereby preserving his statute of limitations defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court found that the following language sufficiently raised the defense of insufficient service of\r\n\r\nprocess under Rule 12(b)(5):   \"Plaintiffs have failed to serve defendant Bruce Hawkins within the three\r\n\r\nyear statute of limitations.\"  Unisun argues the trial court erred in finding this averment properly raised\r\n\r\nthe issue of insufficiency of service of process.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 8(e)(1), SCRCP states that \"[e]ach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct.  No\r\n\r\ntechnical forms of pleadings or motions are required.\"  Moreover, \"[a]ll pleadings shall be so construed as\r\n\r\nto do substantial justice to all parties.\"  Rule 8(f), SCRCP.  We will not, however, write into the pleadings\r\n\r\nallegations and defenses that are not presented. Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 345 S.E.2d 724 (1986).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough our courts have not addressed the degree of specificity required by our rules of civil procedure,\r\n\r\nRule 12(b)(5) is substantially similar to its federal counterpart.  In the absence of prior state law on the\r\n\r\nissue in question, federal cases interpreting the rule are persuasive.  See Roberts v. Peterson, 292 S.C. 149,\r\n\r\n355 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting that where the state rule has adopted the language of a federal\r\n\r\nrule, federal cases interpreting the federal rule are persuasive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal courts addressing this issue have held that objections to the sufficiency of service of process must\r\n\r\nbe specific and must point out in what manner the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the rule relating to the\r\n\r\nservice provisions.  See O'Brien v. R.J. O'Brien &amp; Assocs., 998 F.2d 1394 (7th Cir. 1993) (holding objection\r\n\r\nto service of process must be specific and point out in what manner the rules were not satisfied); Photolab\r\n\r\nCorp. v. Simplex Specialty Co., 806 F.2d 807 (8th Cir. 1986) (same); Sassower v. City of White Plains, 1993\r\n\r\nWL 378862 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (same); King v. Best Western Country Inn, 138 F.R.D. 39 (S.D.N.Y. 1991)\r\n\r\n(same); In re: Highland Acres, Inc. v. Highland Acres, 1994 WL 473357 (Bankr. Mont.) (\"This Court holds\r\n\r\nas a matter of law that an affirmative defense averring a 'Complaint is not timely' does not provide\r\n\r\nsufficient specificity to invoke . . . the insufficiency of service of process defense of [R]ule 12(b), or to avoid\r\n\r\nwaiver under Rule 12(g) and (h).\"); see also White v. Johnson, 259 S.E.2d 731 (Ga. Ct. App. 1979) (noting\r\n\r\nthat under Georgia law, insufficiency of service of process defense must be specifically pled or is waived). \r\n\r\nIn fact, \"[t]he objection to insufficiency of process or its service should point out specifically in what\r\n\r\nmanner plaintiff has failed to satisfy the requirements of the service provision he utilized.\"  5A Charles\r\n\r\nAlan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Civil 2d Â§ 1353 (1990) (citing Travelers\r\n\r\nIns. Co. v. Panama-Williams, Inc., 424 F. Supp. 1156 (N.D. Okla. 1976)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold the averment that Unisun \"failed to serve Bruce Hawkins within the three-year statute of\r\n\r\nlimitations\" is insufficient, standing alone, to raise the defense  of insufficiency of service of process.  Here,\r\n\r\nBruce failed to identify that he was moving to challenge service of process pursuant to Rule 12 and failed\r\n\r\nto specify any defects in the service of process.  Having failed to allege process with even a minimal\r\n\r\namount of specificity in his responsive pleading, Bruce may not now bootstrap the defense to his statute of\r\n\r\nlimitations argument, a separate affirmative defense likewise subject to waiver.  See Rule 8(c),\r\nSCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also reject Bruce's assertion that insufficiency of service of process is a \"lesser included offense\" of the\r\n\r\ntotal failure to serve, such that proper pleading of the defense of non-service requires less specificity than\r\n\r\nthe defense of insufficiency of service of process.  As noted above, Rule 12(b)(5) is the proper vehicle for\r\n\r\nchallenging both \"the mode of delivery or the lack of delivery of the summons and complaint.\"  5A Charles\r\n\r\nAlan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Civil 2d Â§ 1353 (1990) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving failed to properly plead the defense of insufficiency of service of process either by motion or in his\r\n\r\nanswer, Bruce has waived the defense.  Because Bruce failed to challenge the service of process properly,\r\n\r\nhe has also waived his statute of limitations defense under Garner.  Accordingly, we reverse the trial\r\n\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to Bruce and remand the case for trial. (4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisun next argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Hawkinses.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n\r\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 187, 191(1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court held that Unisun's complaint failed to set forth a cause of action against the Hawkinses\r\n\r\nunder the family purpose doctrine or for negligent entrustment.  The court also held that even had Unisun\r\n\r\nproperly pled a cause of action under either theory, Unisun's recovery was barred because the Hawkenses'\r\n\r\nliability was derivative \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Bruce's.  Thus, the trial court reasoned, if the statute of limitations ran against Bruce, it necessarily ran\r\n\r\nagainst the Hawkinses.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisun argues that the trial court erred in finding the Hawkinses' liability was derivative of Bruce's\r\n\r\nliability.  Unisun, however, failed to appeal the underlying ruling--that the complaint failed to set forth a\r\n\r\ncause of action under either theory of recovery.  Hence, it is the law of the case.  See Town of Mt. Pleasant\r\n\r\nv. Jones, 335 S.C. 295, 516 S.E.2d 468 (Ct. App. 1999) (an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case,\r\n\r\nand the appellate court must assume the ruling was correct).   Accordingly, we cannot consider this issue\r\n\r\non appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court did find that Unisun's complaint alleged the Hawkinses violated the Financial\r\n\r\nResponsibility Act.  The court found, however, that Unisun did not have a private cause of action under\r\n\r\nthe Act and granted summary judgment in the Hawkinses' favor.  We agree.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to rest liability on the violation of a statute, the violation must be the proximate cause of the\r\n\r\ninjury.  73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes Â§ 437 (1974).  Proximate cause is the efficient or direct cause of an injury. \r\n\r\nVinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1996).  An act is deemed to be the proximate\r\n\r\ncause of an injury when, without such an act, the injury would not have occurred.  Id.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisun's argument fails because the Hawkinses' violation of the Act was not the proximate cause of the\r\n\r\nunderlying injury in this case.  Although Unisun may have been compelled to pay benefits because the\r\n\r\nHawkinses were uninsured in violation of the Act, their violation was not the proximate cause of the\r\n\r\naccident. (5)  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's granting of summary judgment to the\r\nHawkinses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ.,  concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 14, 1995, Robinson and Jones (the purchasers) purchased a 1985 Maxima vehicle from Metro\r\n\r\nAuto Sales &amp; Finance # 2 under an installment contract.  The contract required the purchasers to\r\n\r\nmaintain insurance on the car with the finance company, Auto Now, named as the loss payee under the\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the contract, the purchasers obtained auto insurance from Catawba, naming Auto Now\r\n\r\nas the loss payee.  In the loss payable clause of the insurance contract, Catawba stated, \"We will give the\r\n\r\nsame advance notice of cancellation to the loss payee as we give to the named insured shown in the\r\n\r\nDeclarations.\"  Auto Now never requested or received a copy of the insurance contract.  They did, however,\r\n\r\nreceive a \"New Business Declaration\" from Catawba which indicated Auto Now was the loss payee under\r\n\r\nthe purchasers' policy.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pay for the insurance coverage, the purchasers contracted with Premium Budget, Inc. (PBI), a premium\r\n\r\nfinance company.  The PBI contract contained a provision in which the purchasers appointed PBI as their\r\n\r\nattorney-in-fact with the authority to cancel their insurance policy in the event they defaulted on their\r\n\r\npayments.  The purchasers subsequently did default on those payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 1995, PBI canceled the insurance policy pursuant to the appointment provision based on\r\n\r\nthe purchasers' default.  The parties stipulated PBI complied in every respect with the requirements for\r\n\r\ncancellation of an insurance policy by a premium service company as mandated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90 (Supp. 1999).  Catawba took no steps to notify Auto Now of the policy cancellation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn or about December 19, 1995, a fire completely destroyed the Maxima.  At the time it was worth\r\n\r\napproximately $3500.00.  Auto Now sought reimbursement of its security interest from Catawba. \r\n\r\nCatawba refused to pay asserting the contract was not in effect at the time of the accident.  It is at this\r\n\r\npoint Auto Now learned of the policy's cancellation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuto Now subsequently brought this action alleging both the insurance policy and Â§ 38-39-90(d) required\r\n\r\nCatawba to notify it of the policy cancellation.  Catawba answered with the contention that no notice was\r\n\r\nrequired to a loss payee under the policy when it was canceled pursuant to a power of attorney from the\r\n\r\ninsured.  The trial judge held the policy provisions required Catawba to provide notice to Auto Now and\r\n\r\nordered Catawba to pay Auto Now $3500.00 for reimbursement of its security interest in the Maxima. \r\n\r\nCatawba appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a non-jury action at law, the trial judge's findings of fact have the same force and effect as a jury verdict\r\n\r\nunless he or she committed some error of law leading to an erroneous conclusion or unless the evidence is\r\n\r\nreasonably susceptible of the opposite conclusion only.  Hiott v. Guaranty Nat'l Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 522, 529,\r\n\r\n496 S.E.2d 417, 421 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (\"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of\r\n\r\nthe judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably\r\n\r\nsupports the judge's findings.\").  However, where an action at law presents a question as to the\r\n\r\nconstruction of a written contract which is clear and unambiguous, the question is not one of fact but one\r\n\r\nof law. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 105, 413 S.E.2d 866,\r\n\r\n868 (Ct. App. 1992).  Moreover, the determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.  Charleston\r\n\r\nCounty Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatawba argues its policy did not require notice to Auto Now of the policy cancellation.  The crux of\r\n\r\nCatawba's argument is that PBI's cancellation of the policy pursuant to a power of attorney was\r\n\r\ntantamount to cancellation by the insured, the purchasers, and thus no notice was required by the terms\r\n\r\nof the policy, which promises the same notice to the loss payee as would be provided to the insured. \r\n\r\nBecause the policy provides for notice to the insured only when the policy is canceled by the insurer, no\r\n\r\nnotice would be required to a loss payee when the policy is canceled by the insured, or by its agent, a\r\n\r\npremium service company, via a power of attorney.  We find the argument ignores the clear intent of the\r\n\r\nstatute governing cancellation by premium service companies such as PBI. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs often stated, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n\r\nlegislature whenever possible.  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).  The statute in its entirety should be given a \"practical, reasonable, and fair\r\n\r\ninterpretation consonant with the purpose, design and policy of lawmakers.\"  Rosenbaum v. S-M-S 32, 311\r\n\r\nS.C. 140, 143, 427 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90 sets out in detail the manner in which a premium service company may cancel\r\n\r\nan insurance contract.  Subsection (a) of that statute states that the insurance contract may not be\r\n\r\ncanceled by a premium service company unless the cancellation is effectuated in accordance with the\r\n\r\nstatute.  Subsection (b) specifically requires the premium service company to deliver to the insured \"at\r\n\r\nleast ten days' written notice of its intent to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured\r\n\r\nwithin the ten-day period.\"  PBI complied with this section and sent the purchasers a notice of intent to\r\n\r\ncancel insurance dated September 22, 1995.  Catawba directs the court's attention to 25A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n\r\nRegs. 69-13(V)(B)(3) (1989) as support for its position.  We do not find this regulation aids Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regulation quoted and relied on by Catawba specifically references the notice of intent to request\r\n\r\ncancellation required by subsection (b).  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 69-13(V)(B)(3) (1976).  In\r\n\r\nrecognition that the insured will already have received notice of the premium service company's intent to\r\n\r\ncancel, the regulation relieves the insurer from providing the insured with any further notice prior to\r\n\r\ncarrying out the cancellation.  Catawba argues that this language also relieves the insurer of the burden of\r\n\r\nnotifying a mortgagee, or loss payee, of the policy cancellation.  We do not believe the drafters of the\r\n\r\nregulation intended to affect the rights of a mortgagee to notice pursuant to a loss payable clause, nor do\r\n\r\nwe believe the literal language of the regulation purports to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The trial judge held that the cancellation by Catawba was carried out pursuant to subsection (2) of the\r\n\r\ncancellation provision of the policy which states that Catawba may cancel for any reason or condition for\r\n\r\nwhich cancellation is allowed by law, and not pursuant to subsection (1) which governs cancellation by the\r\n\r\ninsured.  Subsection (2) states that notice of such cancellation will be mailed to the insured at least fifteen\r\n\r\ndays prior to the cancellation.  Subsection (1) has no notice requirement for the obvious reason that the\r\n\r\ninsured is initiating the cancellation and requires no notice of his or her own actions.  The policy's loss\r\n\r\npayable clause promises the same advance notice of cancellation to the loss payee, or mortgagee, as would\r\n\r\nbe given the insured.  PBI canceled the policy due to the purchasers' nonpayment of the premium. \r\n\r\nNonpayment of premiums is one of a narrow list of reasons an insurer may cancel a contract.  See S.C.\r\n\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 38-75-730 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999).  If PBI had not been a party to this transaction, Catawba\r\n\r\nwould have canceled the policy itself for nonpayment.  In that case, there is no question but that Auto Now\r\n\r\nwould be entitled to notice under the terms of the insurance contract at issue.  Catawba seeks to alter this\r\n\r\nnormal relationship between the insurer and the mortgagee because of an insurance regulation governing\r\n\r\npremium service companies, and the methods by which they may cancel insurance policies.  We do not feel\r\n\r\nthe General Assembly intended such a result.  In fact, the plain language of Â§ 38-39-90 indicates just the\r\n\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsection (d) of Â§ 38-39-90 supports the position that the rights of a mortgagee to notice pursuant to a\r\n\r\nloss payable clause in a contract of insurance are not affected by the statutes or regulations governing\r\n\r\npremium service companies.  It states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll statutory, regulatory, and contractual restrictions providing that the\r\ninsurance contract may not be canceled unless notice is given to a gov\r\nernmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party apply where cancel-\r\nlation is effected under this section.  The insurer shall give the prescribed\r\nnotice in behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mort-\r\ngagee, or other third party by the second business day after the day it re-\r\nceives the notice of cancellation from the premium service company . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). This provision unequivocally expresses the intent of the General Assembly that\r\n\r\nmortgagees' rights to notice under contracts of insurance were not to be compromised by laws governing\r\n\r\npremium service companies.  Thus, in our view, the loss payable provision of the insurance policy is still\r\n\r\nvery much viable.  Additionally, the quoted statute requires an insurer such as Catawba to give notice to a\r\n\r\nmortgagee such as Auto Now on the second business day after it receives notice of intent to cancel from the\r\n\r\npremium service company.  This statutory requirement of notice is independent of Catawba's obligation to\r\n\r\nprovide notice to Auto Now under the loss payable clause of the insurance policy.  Thus, even if the\r\n\r\nregulation relied on by Catawba required a finding that the cancellation in this case was \"the equivalent of\r\n\r\ncancellation by the insured himself\" and thus brought the cancellation within the purview of subsection\r\n\r\n(1) of the policy, the rights of Auto Now would remain unaffected because the General Assembly clearly\r\n\r\nintended otherwise.  The statute and regulation above are intended to modify the relationship between\r\n\r\ninsurer and insured to reflect the changed nature of that relationship vis-a-vis premium service\r\n\r\ncompanies.  They were clearly not intended to negate any obligation of the insurer to a third party such as\r\n\r\na mortgagee.  While Catawba was relieved of the obligation to provide any notice to the purchasers under\r\n\r\nthe policy, such notice having been provided by PBI, there was no concomitant relief of the obligation to\r\n\r\nnotify Auto Now of the cancellation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial  judge's order requiring Catawba to pay $3500.00 to Auto Now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:  I respectfully dissent.  In my view, the circuit judge erred when he ruled that Catawba was required to provide\r\n\r\nnotice of the cancellation of insurance to Auto Now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatawba argues the trial court erred in holding Catawba's policy required it to notify Auto Now of the policy's cancellation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 38-39-90 (d) provides, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll statutory, regulatory, and contractual restrictions providing that the insurance contract may not be canceled unless notice\r\n\r\nis given to a governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party apply where cancellation is effected [by a premium\r\n\r\nservice company]. The insurer shall give the prescribed notice in behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency,\r\n\r\nmortgagee, or other third party by the second business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the\r\n\r\npremium service company and shall determine the effective date of cancellation taking into consideration the number of days'\r\n\r\nnotice required to complete the cancellation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo South Carolina statute or regulation expressly requires the insurance carrier to provide notice to the loss payee.  Auto\r\n\r\nNow argues the South Carolina Supreme Court recognized the loss payee's right to receive notice of involuntary\r\n\r\ncancellation in Rawl v. American Cent. Ins. Co., 94 S.C. 299, 77 S.E.1013 (1913).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Rawl, a fire insurance policy provided: \"'This policy shall be canceled at any time at the request of the insured, or by the\r\n\r\ncompany, by giving five days' notice of such cancellation.'\"  Id. at 299, 77 S.E. at 1013.  The policy also provided, \"'if, with\r\n\r\nthe consent of this company, an interest under this policy should exist in favor of a mortgagee, or any person or corporation\r\n\r\nhaving an interest in the subject of the insurance other than the interest of the insured as described herein, the conditions\r\n\r\nhereinbefore contained shall apply in the manner expressed in such provisions and conditions of insurance relating to such\r\n\r\ninterest as shall be written upon, attached, or appended hereto.'\"  Id.  The supreme court found the burden the insurer\r\n\r\nplaced on itself to provide notice of cancellation was not expressly limited to the insured.  Holding the policy must be\r\n\r\nstrongly construed against the insurer, the court declared that under the policy stipulation, notice must be given to all\r\n\r\npersons who, by the terms of the policy, are interested in maintaining it in force.  Accordingly, it ruled the loss payee was\r\n\r\nentitled to notice of cancellation.  Rawl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Rawl, the loss payee's entitlement to notice was created by the policy's stipulation.  We must look to the Catawba policy\r\n\r\nto determine whether Catawba similarly assumed the burden of providing the loss payee with notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties and, in determining\r\n\r\nthat intention, the court looks to the language of the contract.  If the language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone\r\n\r\ndetermines the contract's force and effect.  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 413\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 866 (Ct. App. 1992).  It is not the function of the courts to rewrite or torture the meaning of an insurance policy to\r\n\r\nextend coverage.  Gambrell v. Travelers Ins. Cos., 280 S.C. 69, 310 S.E.2d 814 (1983).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catawba policy contains a simple loss-payable clause rather than a standard clause.  See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.\r\n\r\nHunt, 327 S.C. 89, 92, 488 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1997) (\"A loss-payable (or open mortgage) clause typically declares that the\r\n\r\nloss, if any, is payable to a mortgagee as its interest might appear.\").  Although a  standard mortgagee clause creates an\r\n\r\nindependent contract for the insurance of the mortgagee's interest, a loss payable clause merely identifies the mortgagee and\r\n\r\nthe mortgagee stands in the insured's shoes.  Id. at 93, 488  S.E.2d at 341.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the loss payable clause, Catawba is required to give the loss payee the same notice of cancellation as it gives to the\r\n\r\nnamed insured.  The policy provides it may be canceled by two methods: (1)  by the insured with written notice to Catawba\r\n\r\nor (2)  by Catawba for \"factors or conditions for which cancellation or deletion is allowed by law at the time the cancellation\r\n\r\nor deletion is to take effect\"  Under the second provision, Catawba was to \"mail to the named insured at the address shown\r\n\r\nin the policy at least 15 days before the date the cancellation or deletion is to take effect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the policy was canceled by operation of law pursuant to the second cancellation provision rather than\r\n\r\nby the insured.  It held Catawba was required to provide the insured, and, thus, Auto Now, with notice of the cancellation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn insurance company may cancel an insurance policy for a limited number of  reasons, including nonpayment of the\r\n\r\npremium.(2)  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75730 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999).  When a company cancels a policy, it must give the named\r\n\r\ninsured written notice of the cancellation.  The notice must be given no later than ten days prior to the effective date for\r\n\r\ncancellation due to nonpayment of the premium and not less than thirty days prior to the effective date for cancellation for\r\n\r\nother reasons.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation 69-13 provides a carrier does not have to provide an insured notice of cancellation when the policy has been\r\n\r\ncanceled by a licensed premium service company for nonpayment of premiums pursuant to a power of attorney under section\r\n\r\n38-39-90.  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.69-13(A)(V)(B)(3) (1989).  The regulation explains,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn such a situation, the insured will have already been notified of the premium service company's intent to request\r\n\r\ncancellation, such cancellation by the premium service company is deemed to be the equivalent of cancellation by the insured\r\n\r\nhimself, and the forms, methods and timing set forth in the premium service laws are declared to be the exclusive means of\r\n\r\neffecting cancellation of insurance contracts by premium service companies. See, S.C. Code Â§ 38-39-90 (b), (c) and (g)\r\n\r\n(1976), as amended.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90(c) (Supp. 1999) (\"The insurance contract must be canceled as if\r\n\r\nthe notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured himself, but without requiring the return of the insurance\r\n\r\ncontract.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPBI's cancellation of the policy on the Maxima was the equivalent of cancellation by Robinson and Jones.  As Regulation\r\n\r\n69-13 clearly provides, Catawba was not required to provide notice to the insured when the policy was canceled by PBI.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the contract, Catawba was only compelled to provide the loss payee with the same notice it was required\r\n\r\nto provide the insured. We are constrained by the statutory, regulatory, and contractual provisions to hold Catawba was not\r\n\r\nrequired to provide notice of the cancellation to Auto Now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 38-39-90(d) also requires a carrier to provide notice on behalf of the named insured.  Although the Auto Now\r\n\r\ncontract mandated that Robinson and Jones maintain insurance on the Maxima, it did not dictate that they provide it with\r\n\r\nnotice if the insurance policy was canceled. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I would reverse the trial court's order requiring Catawba to pay $3,500.00 to Auto Now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The manager of Auto Now testified that Auto Now does not usually receive copies of the actual policy\r\n\r\nbetween an insurer and the puchaser, but rather relies on a declaration of insurance such as provided by\r\n\r\nCatawba in this case.\r\n\r\n2. (a)  No insurance policy or renewal thereof may be cancelled by the insurer prior to the expiration of the term stated in the\r\n\r\npolicy, except for one of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  nonpayment of premium;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (2)  material misrepresentation of fact which, if known to the company, would have caused the company not to issue the\r\n\r\npolicy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (3)  substantial change in the risk assumed, except to the extent that the insurer should reasonably have foreseen the change\r\n\r\nor contemplated the risk in writing the policy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (4)  substantial breaches of contractual duties, conditions, or warranties; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (5)  loss of the insurer's reinsurance covering all or a significant portion of the particular policy insured, or where\r\n\r\ncontinuation of the policy would imperil the insurer's solvency or place that insurer in violation of the insurance laws of this\r\n\r\nState.  Prior to cancellation for reasons permitted in this item (5), the insurer shall notify the director or his designee, in\r\n\r\nwriting, at least sixty days prior to such cancellation and the director or his designee shall, within thirty days of such\r\n\r\nnotification, approve or disapprove such action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C.

Howard Hoffman cross appeals from the Master's order dismissing his causes\r\nof action under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 33-42-10 to -2040\r\n(1990 &amp; Supp. 1999) and for civil conspiracy.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\tIn 1987, Eric Meyer, a real estate broker with the Brumley Company, (1) approached\r\nHenry Kuznik about the possibility of purchasing a tract of land owned by Kuznik located along\r\nBees Ferry Road in Charleston County.  Meyer represented Howard Hoffman.  Kuznik agreed\r\nto sell the land for $50,000 per acre and Hoffman decided to purchase the property.  \r\n\r\n Meyer and the Brumley Company helped negotiate the terms of the purchase.  During\r\nnegotiations, Meyer asked Hoffman if he would be willing to allow a real estate partnership to\r\nparticipate in the purchase.  Hoffman agreed and the purchase was structured to permit\r\nHoffman to assign the property to a general partnership Meyer helped form.  In exchange for\r\nthe assignable option, Hoffman agreed to remain personally liable to Kuznik for the mortgage\r\nand note, which were needed to finance the purchase, should the Partnership default.  The\r\nPartnership became known as Bees Ferry Associates (\"the Partnership\"). (2)  Hoffman obtained\r\na 12.5 percent interest in the Partnership in consideration of the assignment of the contract\r\nfor the sale of the property and his personal guaranty of the purchase money note to Kuznik. \r\n\r\n\t The purpose of the Partnership was to develop and eventually lease or sell the\r\nproperty.  On November 11, 1988, the land was purchased in the Partnership's name.  The\r\nBrumley Company earned an $80,000 commission from the sale. \r\n\r\n\tThe Partnership executed a seven-year purchase money mortgage and note for one\r\nmillion nine-hundred eighty-thousand five-hundred dollars ($1,980,500) to Kuznik.  It\r\nadditionally signed a mortgage and note to South Carolina National Bank for eight-hundred\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars ($825,000) under the contract. \r\n\r\n Frank Brumley, Patrick McKinney, and Meyer did not contribute any capital.  They\r\nbecame managing partners.  The other partners with the exception of Hoffman became \"capital partners.\"  Every year a \"capital call\" went out to the \"capital partners\" advising them\r\nof their percentage payment due to cover their portion of the note and mortgage. \r\n\r\n In 1993, the Partnership mistakenly believed \r\n  the Kuznik note was due and drew up a modification agreement to extend it. Brumley, \r\n  McKinney, and Meyer signed the proposed modification agreement on behalf of \r\n  the Partnership. The Partnership subsequently discovered the note was for seven \r\n  years rather than five years. \r\n\r\n The Partnership made payments on the note through October 1996.  However, at that\r\ntime, the partners became increasingly dissatisfied with the Bees Ferry property. \"They had\r\nhoped that greater development would have occurred at that end of town.\" Meyer testified at\r\ntrial the property wasn't appreciating as desired and it was no longer to the Partnership's\r\nbenefit to continue making payments. \r\n\r\n\tAt the October 1996 meeting, a majority of the partners decided to cease payments\r\non the note and mortgage.  Hoffman was not present at the meeting. \r\n\r\n\tKuznik sent a right to cure letter offering to let the Partnership pay interest only and\r\ndelay payment of the balance if it continued to make payments.  The Partnership did not\r\naccept this offer.  Consequently, Kuznik filed suit against Hoffman individually and against the\r\nPartnership.  In the action, Kuznik sought foreclosure of the Bees Ferry mortgage and a\r\npersonal deficiency judgment against Hoffman on the note.  The Partnership currently owns\r\nsixteen acres of land (Tract I) and has no debt.  The land is valued at approximately one million\r\nfour hundred thousand dollars ($1,400,000).\r\n\r\n \tThe Partnership answered admitting Kuznik had the right to foreclose on the mortgage.\r\nHoffman counterclaimed against Kuznik and filed third party complaints against the\r\nPartnership and each partner individually.  In the complaints, Hoffman alleged breach of\r\ncontract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, civil conspiracy, and violation of the South Carolina\r\nUniform Limited Partnership Act.  By way of relief, Hoffman sought indemnity and an\r\naccounting.  Hoffman subsequently dropped his counterclaim against Kuznik and proceeded\r\nagainst the Partnership and individual partners.  The case was referred to a Master on May\r\n30, 1997.  \r\n\r\n\tThe Master granted Kuznik a deficiency judgment against Hoffman and ordered a\r\nforeclosure sale of the property.  The Master additionally dismissed Hoffman's fraud and\r\nUniform Limited Partnership Act causes of action and determined Hoffman did not establish\r\na cause of action for civil conspiracy.  He did, however, rule the partners and the Partnership:\r\n(1) breached the partnership agreement; (2) breached their fiduciary duty owed to Hoffman; \r\nand (3) must indemnify Hoffman. \r\n\r\n\tThe Partnership and the partners appeal the Master's findings regarding breach of the\r\npartnership agreement and breach of the fiduciary duty owed Hoffman.  Hoffman cross\r\nappeals the Master's rulings on his causes of action for civil conspiracy and violation of the\r\nSouth Carolina Uniform Limited Partnership Act.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Did the Master err in ruling the debt \r\n    was an obligation of the Partnership?\r\n  II. Did the Master err in finding the partners \r\n    did not have the authority to discontinue payments under the partnership agreement? \r\n  \r\n   III. Did the Master err in finding the \r\n    partners liable for breach of contract for failing to continue to make payments \r\n    on the promissory note according to the partnership agreement?\r\n  IV. Did the Master err in determining the \r\n    partners breached their fiduciary duty to Hoffman by discontinuing the payments \r\n    on the promissory note?\r\n   V. Was the decision by the partners to \r\n    discontinue payment on the promissory note protected by the business judgment \r\n    rule?\r\n   VI. Was Hoffman entitled to contractual \r\n    indemnity under the partnership agreement for the loss he will sustain in \r\n    fulfilling the deficiency judgment?\r\n   VII.Was Hoffman entitled to recovery under \r\n    equitable subrogation as a guarantor?\r\n   VIII. Did the Master err in dismissing \r\n    Hoffman's claim for civil conspiracy?\r\n   IX. Was Hoffman entitled to punitive damages \r\n    as a result of the partners' actions? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\t A case with legal and equitable issues presents a divided scope of review.  Perry v.\r\nGadsden, 313 S.C. 296, 437 S.E.2d 174 (Ct. App. 1993).  When legal and equitable actions\r\nare maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of\r\nthe applicable standard of review on appeal.  Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 485 S.E.2d 97\r\n(1997).\r\n\r\n \"An action for breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law and the trial judge's findings\r\nof fact will be upheld unless without evidentiary support.\" Id.; Future Group, II v. Nationsbank,\r\n324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996).  An action seeking damages for breach of contract is\r\nalso an action at law and the trial judge's findings of fact will be upheld unless without support. \r\nBrown v. Allstate Ins. Co., 337 S.C. 499, 523 S.E.2d 807 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n \"Indemnity is that form of compensation in \r\n  which a first party is liable to pay a second party for a loss or damage the \r\n  second party incurs to a third party. A right to indemnity may arise by contract \r\n  (express or implied) or by operation of law as a matter of equity between the \r\n  first and second party.\" Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc. (Winnsboro \r\n  I ), 303 S.C. 52, 56, 398 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 1990), aff'd, \r\n  307 S.C. 128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992) (Winnsboro II) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n \"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the\r\njudge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably\r\nsupports the judge's findings.  The rule is the same whether the judge's findings are made with\r\nor without, a reference.  The judge's findings are equivalent to a jury's findings in a law action. \r\nChapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 211 S.E.2d 876 (1974).\" Townes Assocs. v. City\r\nof Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976)(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\tSubrogation can arise by statute, by contract, or through equity.  Dailey v. Secura Ins.\r\nCo., 476 N.W.2d 299 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991).  Conventional subrogation arises by contract and\r\nis specifically bargained for by the parties.  In contrast, equitable (or legal) subrogation is\r\nimplied subrogation that arises under the common law.  Shumpert v. Time Ins. Co., 329 S.C.\r\n605, 496 S.E.2d 653 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n We note the parties conceded this is an action \r\n  at law.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  The Partnership's Obligation to Make Payments\r\n\r\n\tThe Partnership contends the promissory note was not an obligation of the Partnership\r\ndue to its status as nonrecourse to the Partnership and partners.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tThe evidence demonstrates the Partnership signed a note obligating it to make\r\npayments on the property.  The note stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  For value received, the undersigned, Bees \r\n    Ferry Associates, a South Carolina Partnership (hereinafter sometimes \r\n    referred to as the \"Borrower\"), promises \r\n    to pay to the order of HENRY KUZNIK, c/o Henry's Construction Company, \r\n    2117 Savannah Highway, Charleston, South Carolina 29407 (sometimes hereinafter \r\n    referred to as the \"Lender\"), his successors, heirs and assigns, the principal \r\n    sum of One Million Nine Hundred Eighty Thousand Five Hundred ($1,980,500.00) \r\n    Dollars, with interest thereon, or on those amounts remaining unpaid from \r\n    time to time, from the date hereof at a rate of interest per annum â€¦.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). \r\n\r\n Further evidence of the Partnership's duty to pay is the capital call letters sent to the\r\npartners describing the loan as \"the Bees Ferry Associates Partnership loan to the purchase\r\nmoney holder, Henry Kuznik.\"  The capital call letters further characterize the interest payment\r\non the loan as \"due and payable.\"  \r\n\r\n\tA financial statement of the Partnership's activity indicates the Partnership bought land\r\nin November of 1988.  The loan appeared on both the Partnership's and the partners' income\r\ntax statements as a liability.  The Partnership listed the debt on its balance sheet and paid\r\ntaxes on the land. \r\n\r\n The mortgage the Partnership obtained to \r\n  pay the above promissory agreement demonstrates \r\n  the Partnership's duty to make payments. The mortgage contract pronounces:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas, the \r\n    said Bees Ferry Associates, a South Carolina Partnership[,] stands firmly \r\n    held and bound unto Henry Kuznik, in the principal sum of One Million Nine \r\n    Hundred Eighty Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 ($1,980,500.00) Dollars as \r\n    evidenced by a certain promissory note bearing even date herewith, \r\n    made payable and delivered to the mortgagee-obligee, wherein the mortgagor-obligor \r\n    agreed to pay the same with interest thereon, according to the terms of said \r\n    promissory note, to which reference is specifically made.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   The mortgage further proclaims,\r\n   NOW, KNOW ALL MEN, that the said BEES \r\n    FERRY ASSOCIATES in consideration \r\n    of the said debt and sum of money aforesaid, and for the better \r\n    securing the payment thereof \r\n    to the said HENRY KUZNIK, according to the condition of the said Note; and \r\n    also in consideration of the further sum of Three Dollars to it, the said \r\n    BEES FERRY ASSOCIATES in hand well and truly paid by the said HENRY KUZNIK, \r\n    at and before the sealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof \r\n    is hereby acknowledged, has granted, bargained, sold and released, and by \r\n    these presents, does grant, bargain, sell and release unto the said HENRY \r\n    KUZNIK, his successors, heirs and assigns, the following described property, \r\n    to wit:\r\n  All those two certain pieces, parcels or \r\n    tracts of land, situate, lying and being to the North of Savannah Highway \r\n    - US 17 South, to the west of Main Road and to the south of Bees Ferry Road \r\n    in St. Andrews Parish in the County of Charleston, State aforesaid, shown \r\n    and delineated as Tract II 11.19 Ac and Tract III Residual 32.42 Ac â€¦. \r\n\r\nWilliam Schools, the president of Greenbax, testified Greenbax paid capital calls on the\r\nKuznik mortgage because the calls were an obligation.  Additionally, the Partners paid their\r\ncapital calls until the time of default, and the Partnership partly performed the above\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\n\tJohn Warren, the attorney for the Partnership, testified during examination by the court: \r\n\r\nQ. But the primary maker on the note was the \r\n  partnership? \r\n A. That's correct. \r\nQ. So that is an obligation of the partnership, \r\n  is it not?\r\nA. To the extent that that nonrecourse note \r\n  was an obligation of the partnership, that's right. \r\n\r\n\r\n . . . \r\n\r\nQ. But it was an obligation of the note, was \r\n  it not, of the partnership? \r\nA. An obligation in the sense, that, yes, \r\n  it would have been a debt of theirs[.] \r\nQ. They agreed to pay somebody money; that's \r\n  an obligation. \r\nA, That's right. But, that promise was not \r\n  enforceable if they gave the property back at any time. \r\n\tWe find the evidence shows the Partnership had an obligation to make payments to\r\nKuznik.  Hoffman's continuing personal liability on the note merely limited the relief Kuznikcould seek from the Partnership in the event of default -- \"the Lender agrees that no recourse\r\nshall be had for the payment of any sums due under this Note â€¦.\" The note was nonrecourse\r\nto the partners and the Partnership.  While this may have removed the economic incentive for\r\nthe Partnership to make the payments, it did not remove the contractual obligation.  This\r\nlimitation did not affect Hoffman's ability to seek relief from the Partnership in the event of\r\ndefault.  The Master's conclusion the Partnership had an obligation to make payments on the\r\nproperty is supported by the evidence in the record.\r\n\r\nII. Partnership's Authority \r\n  to Default on Payments \r\nunder the Partnership Agreement\r\n\r\n\tThe Partnership asserts the partners had authority under the partnership agreement\r\nto default on the payments for the promissory note and allow the property to be taken in\r\nforfeiture.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n The Master's factual determinations included: (1) \"the purpose of the partnership was\r\nto purchase the property from Kuznik for $3,000,000.00;\" and (2) \"the partnership agreement\r\ndoes not contain authority to dispose of partnership assets by allowing them to go into\r\nforeclosure.\" The Master concluded: \r\n\r\n \r\n  While section 12.2(a) does give to the partners the right to \"dispose\" of property, it would be an absurd construction to state this language implies the partners have the \"right\" to \"dispose\" of property by allowing it to be sold under foreclosure â€¦. Common sense and good faith are the leading touchstones of the construction of a contract and contracts are to be so construed as to avoid an absurd result. Georgetown Manufacturing and Warehouse Company v. South Carolina Department of Agriculture, 301 S.C. 514, 392 S.E.2d 801 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\n   This Court has held:\r\n  Common sense and good faith are key principles of construction of the provisions of a contract. In construing terms of a contract, the reviewing court must look at the language of the contract to determine the intentions of the parties. When the language of the contract is clear, explicit and unambiguous, it must be taken and understood in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense. C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp; Human Serv. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 373 S.E.2d 584 (1988).\r\n\r\nGoode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 445, 494 S.E.2d 827, 833 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n\r\n In C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc., supra, the Supreme Court reasoned: \"Common sense and good faith are the leading touchstones of construction of the provisions of a contract; where one construction makes the provisions unusual or extraordinary and another construction which is equally consistent with the language employed, would make it reasonable, fair and just, the latter construction must prevail.\" Id. at 377, 373 S.E.2d at 586 (citing Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 218 S.E.2d 431(1975)). \r\n\r\n \r\n   The partnership agreement provided:\r\n   Section 12.2. Authorization: It shall be necessary for Partners holding seventy-five (75%) percent of the capital interest in the Partnership to consent to any act or execute any document or enter into any contract or any agreement of any nature necessary or desirable, in pursuance of the purposes of the Partnership, including, without limitation, the authority:\r\n   \r\n     (a) To acquire, hold, lease, and dispose of the Property or any portion thereof or interest therein or appurtenant thereto, as well as personal or mixed property connected therewith, including the purchase, trade or sale of such properties;\r\n     (b) To borrow money and, if security is required therefor, to mortgage or subject to any other security device, the Property or any portion thereof or obtain replacements for any mortgage, security deed, or other security device, and to prepay, in whole or in part, increase, modify, consolidate, or extend any mortgage, security deed or other security device;\r\n     (c) To place record title to, or the right to use, Partnership assets in the name of names of a nominee or trustee;\r\n     (d) To acquire and enter into contracts of insurance, guaranty or surety, which may be necessary and proper for the protection of the Partnership, for the conservation of its assets, or for any purpose convenient or beneficial to the Partnership;\r\n     (e) To employ, engage or contract with persons in the operation and management of the Partnership business, including, but not limited to, supervisory managing agents, insurance brokers, real estate brokers, and loan brokers; and \r\n     (f) To execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all instruments to effectuate the foregoing.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). \r\n\r\n \r\n   The agreement defines the raison d'etre of the Partnership in Â§ 3.1:\r\n   Section 3.1. Purpose of the Partnership: The business of the Partnership shall be to acquire, hold, improve, develop, sublease, and/or sell, in whole or in part the Property or to participate in the owning, leasing, holding, mortgaging subleasing, selling, improvement and managing of the Property and any other purposes as are necessary to protect or enhance the assets of the Partnership.\r\n\r\n The partners concurred that the purpose of the Partnership was to acquire, develop, and sell the property. \r\n\r\n The partners did not have the authority to cease making payments on the loan. An examination of the contract reveals the Partnership was created to \"acquire, hold, improve, develop, sublease, and/or sell, in whole or in part the Property or to participate in the owning, leasing, holding, mortgaging, subleasing, selling, improvement and managing of the Property and any other purposes as are necessary to protect or enhance the assets of the Partnership.\" Nowhere does the agreement state the partners may decide to divest the Partnership of its assets by permitting them to be sold in foreclosure. Foreclosure of Partnership assets does not promote the Partnership's established purposes.\r\n\r\nIII. Breach of Partnership Agreement\r\n\r\n Hoffman maintains the partners breached the partnership agreement by failing to pay their capital calls. We agree.\r\n\r\n The partnership agreement required all capital partners to pay capital calls to cover expenses of the Partnership, including taxes and interest on the note from Kuznik. The agreement reads:\r\n\r\n \r\n  Section 7.1. Capital Calls: Each partner other than Howard Hoffman and Brumley/McKinney/Meyer shall pay capital calls pursuant to this agreement in that proportion which the capital interest of each Partner bears to the total capital interest of Partners responsible for capital calls. Howard Hoffman and Brumley/McKinney/Meyer shall not be responsible for capital calls.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n The managing partners, Brumley/McKinney/Meyer, notified the capital partners on October 7, 1996 of the amount of their capital call, and requested a meeting to discuss the direction of the Partnership. The memo to one of the partners, Ned Payne, states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n \r\n  We are at an important time in the determination of our long term business strategy for our investment at Bees Ferry Road and Highway 17S. I think it would be appropriate to have a partnership meeting to discuss our direction. On November 10th, we have interest due on the Kuznik note in the amount of $158,440.00. As in past years, it will be necessary to have a capital call to pay this amount and I would like to have some consensus on where we are going. Your pro rata share of the capital call would be $21,120.\r\n\r\n The Master found this was a capital call, obligating the capital call partners for their appropriate share. The partners argue there was no capital call issued. We disagree with the partners' assertion.\r\n\r\n The memo references the amount of the partners' responsibility toward the capital call. While it does reference the need for a meeting, the capital call partners were informed of their obligation. Several of the partners sent their payments for the capital calls after receiving the memo. These payments were later returned by Brumley/McKinney/Meyer. The Master correctly concluded the memo was a capital call.\r\n\r\n Once the request for payment of the capital calls was issued, the partners were obligated to make payment. Section 7.1 of the partnership agreement says: \"Each partner . . . shall pay capital calls.\" (Emphasis added). There is no evidence showing any of the partners, with the exception of Carr, were financially unable to make payment. Carr stood alone in refusing to join in the vote to cease honoring the capital calls. We find the evidence validates the Master's decision that the partners' (with the exception of Carr) failure to pay the October capital call was a breach of the Partnership agreement.\r\n\r\nIV. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\nA. Fiduciary Duty in South Carolina\r\n\r\n Renowned jurist, Justice Cardozo, characterized the duty owed by partners in the often quoted Meinhard v. Salmon, 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928):\r\n\r\n \r\n  Joint adventurers, like copartners, owe to one another, while the enterprise continues, the duty of the finest loyalty. Many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm's length, are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary ties. A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the 'disintegrating erosion' of particular exceptions. Only thus has the level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd. It will not consciously be lowered by any judgment of this court. \r\n\r\nMeinhard, 164 N.E. at 546 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n \r\n   According to 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§410 (1987):\r\n  One of the paramount duties of partners among themselves, if not the primary duty, is their fiduciary duty, universally recognized as including a duty to exercise good faith and maintain the highest integrity in dealing with other partners.\r\n\r\n  Section 420 continues:\r\n  The courts universally recognize the fiduciary relationship of partners and impose on them obligations of the utmost good faith and integrity in their dealings with one another in partnership affairs. It is a fundamental characteristic of partnership that the partners' relationship is one of trust and confidence when dealing with each other in partnership matters.\r\n    \r\nPartners are held to a standard stricter than the morals of the marketplace, and their fiduciary duties should be broadly construed, connoting not mere honesty but the punctilio of honor most sensitive. In all matters connected with the partnership every partner is bound to act in a manner not to obtain any advantage over his copartner in the partnership affairs by the slightest misrepresentation, concealment, threat, or adverse pressure of any kind. A partner cannot act too quickly to protect his own financial position at the expense of his partners, even in the absence of malice.\r\n\r\n59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 420 (1987) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). \r\n\r\n \r\n   South Carolina recognizes the fiduciary duty owed between partners:\r\n   The law holds each member of a partnership to the highest degree of good faith in his dealings with reference to any matter which concerns the business of the common engagement, and each partner, being the agent of the firm, must be held to the same accountability as other trustees, in all matters which affect the common interest. The relationship of a partnership is fiduciary in character and imposes on the members the obligation of refraining from taking any advantage of one another by the slightest misrepresentation or concealment.\r\n\r\n Lawson v. Rogers, 312 S.C. 492, 498-499, 435 S.E.2d 853, 857 (1993)(emphasis added) (citations omitted). \r\n\r\n \r\n  Under the cases decided by this Court, the partners are treated as fiduciaries each to the other and characterizes their relationship as one of mutual trust and confidence, imposing upon them the usual trust requirements of loyalty, good faith and fair dealing. Whitman v. Bowden, 27 S.C. 53, 2 S.E. 630 [1884]; Price v. Middleton, 75 S.C. 105, 55 S.E. 156 [1906]; and Badder v. Saleeby, 131 S.C. 101, 126 S.E. 438 [1924]. \r\n\r\nFew v. Few, 239 S.C. 321, 336, 122 S.E.2d 829, 836 (1961).\r\n\r\n \r\n   This duty is further detailed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-540 (Supp. 1999):\r\n  (1) Every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.\r\n\r\n Apodictically, the partners of Bees Ferry stood in a fiduciary relationship with Hoffman. They therefore owed him the duty of good faith and a highest loyalty.\r\n\r\nB. Business Judgment Rule Generally\r\n\r\n The partners and the Partnership claim their actions are protected under the business judgment rule. We disagree.\r\n\r\n The business judgment rule has been utilized in South Carolina to protect corporate directors:\r\n\r\n \r\n   Under the business judgment rule, a court will not review the business judgment of a corporate governing board when it acts within its authority and it acts without corrupt motives and in good faith. \r\n\r\nDockside Ass'n, Inc. v. Detyens, 291 S.C. 214, 217, 352 S.E.2d 714, 716 (Ct. App. 1987), aff'd, 294 S.C. 86, 362 S.E.2d 874 (1987) (citing H. Henn, Law of Corporations Â§ 242 (2d ed. 1970). See also Goddard v. Fairways Dev. Gen. Partnership, 310 S.C. 408, 426 S.E.2d 828 (Ct. App. 1993)(in a dispute between directors of homeowners association and aggrieved homeowners, conduct of directors should be judged by the business judgment rule and absent showing of bad faith, dishonesty, or incompetence, judgment of directors will not be set aside by judicial action); Seabrook Island Property Owners Ass'n v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 356 S.E.2d 411 (Ct. App. 1987)(the business judgment rule applies to intra vires action of corporation, not to ultra vires acts).\r\n\r\n South Carolina has codified a similar rule in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-8-300 (Supp. 1999), as the standard of review for the decisions made by corporate directors and officers:\r\n\r\n \r\n  (a) A director shall discharge his duties as a director, including his duties as a member of a committee:\r\n   \r\n    (1) in good faith;\r\n    (2) with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and\r\n    (3) in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders.\r\n  \r\n\r\n The business judgment rule requires directors to act reasonably and in good faith. It does not expect perfection. However, the rule will not apply if the directors have engaged in self-dealing, fraud, or other unconscionable conduct. See Dockside Ass'n, Inc. v. Detyens, 294 S.C. 86, 362 S.E.2d 874 (1987)(business judgment rule precludes judicial review of actions taken by corporate governing board absent showing of lack of good faith, fraud, self-dealing or unconscionable conduct)(citing Papalexiou v. Tower West Condominium, 401 A.2d 280 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1979)).\r\n\r\nC. Business Judgment Rule as Applied to Partnerships\r\n\r\n The opportunity has not arisen in South Carolina to apply the business judgment rule to partnerships. In Anthony v. Padmar, 320 S.C. 436, 465 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1995), this Court mentions the possible application of the business judgment rule to limited partnerships. However, the issue was not before this Court because the trial court reviewed the decision under a strict fiduciary duty standard and the general partners did not appeal. This Court cited several other states in a footnote:\r\n\r\n \r\n  Courts from other jurisdictions have variously applied the fiduciary duty, the business judgment rule, and breach of contractual duty standards to the conduct of a general partner vis-a-vis his limited partners. 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 1335 et. seq. (1987); see Wyler v. Feuer, 85 Cal.App.3rd 392, 149 Cal.Rptr. 626 (1978) (applied the business judgment rule); Roper v. Thomas, 60 N.C.App. 64, 298 S.E.2d 424 (1982) (refused to apply the business judgment standard to the actions of general partners because the duties of the general partners were set out in the partnership agreement, and general partners clearly breached those duties); Appletree Square I Limited Partnership v. Investmark, Inc., 494 N.W.2d 889 (Minn. Ct. App. 1993)(applied strict fiduciary standard); Konover Dev. Corp. v. Zeller, 228 Conn. 206, 635 A.2d 798 (1994) (applied a modified fiduciary standard so that the determinative consideration was whether the general partners dealt fairly with the limited partners). \r\n\r\nPadmar, 320 S.C. at 448 n.7, 465 S.E.2d at 752 n.7.\r\n\r\n Other states have compared limited partnerships to corporations to determine the general partner should have protection from liability:\r\n\r\n \r\n  A limited partnership affords a vehicle for capital investment whereby the limited partner restricts his liability to the amount of his investment in return for surrender of any right to manage and control the partnership business. In a limited partnership the general partner manages and controls the partnership business. In exercising his management functions the general partner comes under a fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing toward other members of the partnership. \r\n  These characteristics limited investor liability, delegation of authority to management, and fiduciary duty owed by management to investors are similar to those existing in corporate investment, where it has long been the rule that directors are not liable to stockholders for mistakes made in the exercise of honest business judgment or for losses incurred in the good faith performance of their duties when they have used such care as an ordinarily prudent person would use. By this standard a general partner may not be held liable for mistakes made or losses incurred in the good faith exercise of reasonable business judgment.\r\n\r\nWyler v. Feuer, 149 Cal. Rptr. 626, 632-33 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978).\r\n\r\n Few cases have dealt with the application of the business judgment rule to general partnerships. While the extension to limited partnerships is reconciled by their similarity to a corporation's structure, the same does not hold true for general partnerships. Several jurisdictions have, nonetheless, extended the business judgment rule to protect the decisions made by general partners.\r\n\r\n In Bane v. Ferguson, 890 F.2d 11 (7th Cir. 1989), the Court of Appeals applied Illinois law to a law firm partnership. A lawsuit was brought against partners in the law firm's managing council for breach of fiduciary duty based on its actions resulting in the termination of the retirement plan. The court announced:\r\n\r\n \r\n  A partner is a fiduciary of his partners, but not of his former partners, for the withdrawal of a partner terminates the partnership as to him â€¦. Even if the defendants were fiduciaries of the plaintiff, moreover, the business-judgment rule would shield them from liability for mere negligence in the operation of the firm, just as it would shield a corporation's directors and officers, who are fiduciaries of the shareholders.\r\n\r\nBane, 890 F.2d at 14.\r\n\r\n In Levine v. Levine, 590 N.Y.S.2d 439 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992), the parties were partners in real estate partnerships. One group of partners alleged a breach of fiduciary duty in the course of negotiating the conversion of the partnership's property to cooperative ownership. The court enunciated:\r\n\r\n \r\n  Rather, their claim of wrongdoing is based solely on the charge that the Stonehenge and Paris partnerships breached a fiduciary duty owed them as partners. Under the business judgment rule, however, a fiduciary's business decisions \"taken in good faith and in the exercise of honest judgment in the lawful and legitimate furtherance of [the principal's] purposes\" are beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny. . . . If the decision is made in good faith and without personal bias or conflict of interest, the fiduciary is not liable even if the decisions turn out to be unwise or unsound. While the business judgment rule is most frequently applied in actions against corporate directors for the breach of fiduciary duties owed to the corporation or its stockholders, its rationale applies equally to partners acting as fiduciaries for the partnership and the other partners.\r\n\r\nLevine, 590 N.Y.S.2d at 443 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts addressed the application of the business judgment rule to a partnership in Starr v. Fordham, 648 N.E.2d 1261 (Mass. 1995). In that case, a withdrawing partner of a law firm brought suit against the remaining partners for breach of fiduciary duty relating to their calculation of his share of the year's profits. The court explicated the rule:\r\n\r\n \r\n   The founding partners argue next that the judge erred in concluding that the business judgment rule does not preclude judicial review of their determination of the plaintiff's share of the 1986 profits. There was no error.\r\n   The test to be applied when one partner alleges that another partner has violated his duty of strict faith is whether the allegedly violating partner can demonstrate a legitimate business purpose for his action. Nevertheless, the business judgment rule does not apply if the plaintiff can demonstrate self-dealing on the part of the allegedly wrongdoing partner. Having properly concluded that the founding partners had engaged in self-dealing when they assigned to the plaintiff his share of the profit, the judge made no error in concluding that the business judgment rule did not apply to the founding partners' actions.\r\n\r\nFordham, 648 N.E.2d at 1265-66 (emphasis added)(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n We conclude the business judgment rule may apply to partnerships in South Carolina. When a partner alleges another has violated his fiduciary duty, the allegedly violating partner must show he acted: (1) in good faith; (2) with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the partner reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the partnership. However, the rule will not apply if the partners have engaged in self-dealing, fraud, or other unconscionable conduct. See Dockside Ass'n, Inc. v. Detyens, 294 S.C. 86, 362 S.E.2d 874 (1987) (citing Papalexiou v. Tower West Condominium, 401 A.2d 280 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1979)); Fordham, supra; 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 443 (1987)(\"[A partner] must refrain from taking any advantage of another partner by the slightest adverse conduct of any kind. A partner may not engage in self-dealing for his own benefit to the exclusion of his partners in respect to matters within the scope of the partnership enterprise and within the particular purpose of the partnership.\").\r\n\r\nD. Application of Business Judgment Rule in This Case\r\n\r\n We have determined the business judgment rule may apply to partnerships, thus eliminating judicial review of business decisions in the best interest of the partnership if they are made in good faith and with the care of an ordinarily prudent person. The Partnership avers its decision to default on the loan to Kuznik was in its best interest and, therefore, is not subject to review under the business judgment rule. We disagree.\r\n\r\n The Partnership argues by defaulting on the loan, the Partnership was able to save large amounts of money in interest and principal payments, for which it would never receive a profitable return:\r\n\r\n \r\n   At the time of the decision to discontinue payments, the partnership had paid a total of $2,325,206. To pay off the Kuznik note required an additional payment of $2,138,940, comprised of [$]1,980,500 (the face value of the note) and $158,440 (the 8% interest due in November, 1996), raising the total investment in the property to $4,464,146. The property had a total value of $2,850,000. Thus, paying off the note would have yielded a net loss of $1,614,146 to the partnership. \r\n   As a result of the decision to discontinue payments on the note and mortgage, the cost of the property was fixed at $2,325,206. The partnership owned Tract I, valued at $1,400,000. Thus, discontinuing the note and mortgage payments reduced the partnership's loss position to $925,206, a savings of $688,940 â€¦. [C]ontrary to the Master's Order, this benefitted the partnership.\r\n\r\n While we understand how the default on the note benefitted the capital partners, it was done at the detriment of one of the other partners, Hoffman. The Master found the decision to default and allow the property to enter foreclosure was self-serving and unconscionable. The evidentiary record buttresses the decision of the Master.\r\n\r\n The capital call partners have a direct interest in how much money they will be forced to pay Kuznik on the promissory note. The capital call partners were responsible for paying the interest and principal on the promissory note. In return, their profits would come only after the property was developed and/or sold. Thus, the capital call partners had some self-interest in defaulting on the promissory note and allowing the property to enter foreclosure, as opposed to continuing to make payments on the note. \r\n\r\n Knowing that the note was nonrecourse, Kuznik's only avenue was foreclosure and enforcement of a deficiency judgment against Hoffman. The capital call partners would suffer no harm as a result if the decision is allowed to stand. They would own Tract I outright, have no more obligation on the other tracts, and Hoffman would shoulder the burden for the Partnership of paying off the loan to Kuznik.\r\n\r\n The Master also found the act to be ultra vires and therefore beyond the scope of protection by the business judgment rule. Having previously determined that the partnership agreement did not grant the partners the right to default on the loan, we agree the act was ultra vires. The partners may exercise only those acts which are permitted by law or by the partnership agreement, acts beyond the scope of the powers so granted are ultra vires. \"The 'business judgment' rule applies to intra vires â€¦ not to ultra vires acts.\" Seabrook Island Property Owners Assoc. v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 348, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987). See Dockside Ass'n, Inc. v. Detyens, 291 S.C. 214, 352 S.E.2d 714 (Ct. App. 1987). As a result, we conclude there was no error in the Master's decision that the business judgment rule would not apply.\r\n\r\nE. Partners' Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\n As Justice Frankfurter stated in SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 86, 63 S. Ct. 454, 458, 87 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1943):\r\n\r\n \r\n  [T]o say that a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis; it gives direction to further inquiry. To whom is he a fiduciary? What obligations does he owe as a fiduciary? In what respect has he failed to discharge these obligations? And what are the consequences of his deviation from duty?\r\n\r\n The partners of Bees Ferry owed the Partnership and each other a duty of loyalty, good faith, and fair dealing. They were to conduct their business with the \"punctilio of honor the most sensitive.\" Hoffman was owed this duty of loyalty and fair dealing by the capital call partners in the Partnership, and every decision must be made to prevent self-interests from being placed above the interest of the other partners.\r\n\r\n In Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 485 S.E.2d 97 (1997), the Court held a partner's failure to disclose to another partner that he had purchased land later purchased by the partnership constituted a breach of fiduciary duty even though a written partnership agreement did not come into existence until after the land was purchased. The Court found the purchase of the land was intimately connected with the formation of the partnership and a partnership arose by implication prior to the written agreement. In like manner, Hoffman and Meyer's negotiations with Kuznik for an assignable option and Hoffman's agreement to remain liable on the note were intimately connected with and accomplished in anticipation of the formation of the Partnership. Therefore, the Partnership may not avoid its duty to Hoffman by declaring it had not yet come into existence and Hoffman's obligation was a personal liability undertaken prior to the formation of the Partnership. \r\n\r\n By deciding to default on the loans and placing the entire burden of their payment on Hoffman, the partners violated their duty of fair dealing and loyalty. They placed their own economic interests above those of a fellow partner, and the outcome was most unconscionable. Since the decision was laced with self-interests, the Partnership could not be protected by the business judgment rule. The partners' actions were in violation of Hoffman's trust and confidence, and were a breach of the partnership agreement. We rule the actions taken by the partners in defaulting on the loan to Kuznik, allowing the property to be foreclosed, and forcing Hoffman to shoulder the burden of paying off the entire amount are a violation of their fiduciary duties to Hoffman. \r\n\r\nV. Contractual Indemnity \r\n\r\n Hoffman is entitled to indemnity under the terms of the partnership agreement and under South Carolina law. Because Hoffman's right to indemnity arose by virtue of the contract, it is reviewed under the same standard as the breach of fiduciary duty and the breach of contract action. See Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc. (Winnsboro I ), 303 S.C. 52, 398 S.E.2d 500 (Ct. App. 1990), aff'd, 307 S.C. 128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992) (Winnsboro II )(holding right to indemnity may arise by contract); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976)(holding in an action at law the factual findings will not be reversed unless they are without evidentiary support). The Master's ruling \r\n\r\nwill be affirmed if there is any evidence to support it. The partnership agreement stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n  The Partnership shall indemnify any Partner against any loss or threat of loss as a result of any claim or legal proceeding related to the performance of any act concerning the business or activities of the Partnership so long as the Partner was acting in good faith within what was reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Partnership.\r\n   South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-510 (1990) further provides:\r\n   The rights and duties of the partners in relation to the partnership shall be determined, subject to any agreement between them, by the following rules:\r\n  . . . .\r\n   (2) The partnership must indemnify every partner in respect of payments made, and personal liabilities reasonably incurred by him in the ordinary and proper conduct of its business or for the preservation of its business or property;\r\n\r\n The payment of the debt to Kuznik indubitably constitutes an action \"concerning the business or activities of the partnership.\" Hoffman, at the time of trial, had not paid the amount owed to Kuznik. However, this does not render the Partnership's obligation to indemnify him moot. The partnership agreement allowed indemnity for a \"threat of loss,\" and a financial judgment against someone is, at a minimum, a threat of loss. The judgment is a lien, and as such, Hoffman has no choice but to pay the amount to Kuznik. The Partnership should not avoid its responsibility to Hoffman because he chose to seek indemnity prior to exchanging the amount owed.\r\n\r\n The evidence upholds the Master's conclusion that Hoffman was entitled to indemnity. The debt owed to Kuznik was a legal obligation of the Partnership. The Partners defaulted on the payments, and subsequently, the property entered foreclosure. Kuznik was granted a deficiency judgment against Hoffman on the note, and Hoffman has the obligation to make payment. The judgment against Hoffman and the payments to be made are in the course of the Partnership's business, and therefore should be the responsibility of the Partnership. We affirm the Master's decision granting Hoffman indemnity under the partnership agreement.\r\n\r\nVI. Equitable Subrogation\r\n\r\n Subrogation can arise by statute, by contract, or through equity. Dailey v. Secura Ins. Co., 476 N.W.2d 299 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991). Conventional subrogation arises by contract and is specifically bargained for by the parties. In contrast, equitable (or legal) subrogation is implied subrogation that arises under the common law. As explicated in Shumpert v. Time Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 605, 496 S.E.2d 653 (Ct. App. 1998):\r\n\r\n \r\n  \"Subrogation may be broadly defined as the substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim or right.\" 73 Am. Jur. 2d Subrogation Â§ 1 (1974) â€¦. Subrogation enables the insurer to recover the amount paid to its insured out of any judgment or settlement proceeds received by the insured from the third party.\r\n  Subrogation can arise by statute, by contract, or through equity. Dailey v. Secura Ins. Co., 164 Wis. 2d 624, 476 N.W.2d 299 (App. 1991). Conventional subrogation arises by contract and is specifically bargained for by the parties. In contrast, equitable (or legal) subrogation is implied subrogation that arises under the common law. \r\n  Legal subrogation is not dependent upon contract. The doctrine is an equitable one, founded not upon any fixed law, but upon principles of natural justice; its purpose is to require the ultimate discharge of a debt by the person who in equity and good conscience ought to pay it; and it is to be applied according to the dictates of equity and good conscience in the light of the actions and relationship of the parties. Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. James, 236 S.C. 431, 435, 114 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1960).\r\n   The elements of the doctrine of equitable subrogation are (1) the party claiming subrogation has paid the debt; (2) the party was not a volunteer, but had a direct interest in the discharge of the debt or lien; (3) the party was secondarily liable for the debt or for the discharge of the lien; and (4) no injustice will be done to the other party by the allowance of the equity. United Carolina Bank v. Caroprop, Ltd., 316 S.C. 1, 446 S.E.2d 415 (1994).\r\n\r\nShumpert, 329 S.C. at 611-12, 496 S.E.2d at 656 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n The Partnership maintains Hoffman failed to plead equitable subrogation in his Amended Answer and Third Party Complaint. The Master relied on Black's Law Dictionary definitions to determine that when Hoffman pled indemnity, he placed the Partnership on notice of a claim for equitable subrogation. The Master said: \"This court is aware there are technical distinctions between the two concepts, but they exist mainly as a way of framing the issue. The third-party defendants had notice of the claim of subrogation when the defense of indemnity was raised in this case.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n Hoffman's claim for indemnity arises out of the partnership agreement's indemnity clause. It is a contractual basis for indemnity and not an equitable one. Equitable subrogation requires the claimant to prove he paid the debt as a secondarily liable party to the debt. Nowhere in the Amended Answer and Third-Party Complaint does Hoffman plead the required elements of equitable subrogation. The claim for equitable subrogation cannot be \"bootstrapped\" onto the claim for contractual indemnity.\r\n\r\n However, even if Hoffman plead equitable subrogation, it would have been futile. Under equitable subrogation, he would step into the shoes of the original creditor. See Dodge City of Spartanburg, Inc. v. Jones, 317 S.C. 491, 454 S.E.2d 918 (Ct. App. 1995)(through doctrine of equitable subrogation, subsequent creditor can assume rights and priority of prior creditor). In this case, the creditor was Kuznik. The note signed by the Partnership was a nonrecourse note. As such, Kuznik had no recourse against the Partnership or its partners. By extension, Hoffman, claiming under equitable subrogation, would have no recourse against the Partnership or individual partners. We reverse the finding of the Master granting Hoffman reimbursement under the doctrine of equitable subrogation.\r\n\r\nVII. Hoffman's Appeal\r\n\r\nA. Civil Conspiracy\r\n\r\n Hoffman asserts the Master erred in dismissing his cause of action for civil conspiracy. The Master held no action for civil conspiracy may lie when the conspiracy is discussed openly rather than surreptitiously. We disagree. An action for civil conspiracy does not require the element of secrecy.\r\n\r\n It is well-settled in South Carolina that the tort of civil conspiracy contains three elements: (1) a combination of two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff; (3) causing plaintiff special damage. See Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996); Lamotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711 (1988); Lee v. Chesterfield Gen. Hosp., Inc., 289 S.C. 6, 344 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\n Clandestine activity is not an element of a civil conspiracy though many conspiracies are furtively formed thereby making proof of the conspiracy difficult for a plaintiff. Consequently, civil conspiracy has been characterized as \"an act which is, by its very nature, covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible of proof by direct evidence.\" First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 575, 511 S.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct. App. 1998)(quoting Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 599, 358 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. 1987)). We find the Master erred in concluding secrecy was an essential element of a civil conspiracy. Nonetheless, we affirm the Master's dismissal of Hoffman's cause of action for civil conspiracy on additional grounds. (3)\r\n\r\n An action for civil conspiracy will not lie if a plaintiff has obtained relief through other avenues. See Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 284, 278 S.E.2d 607 (1981). This is a unique feature of the tort of civil conspiracy. The Supreme Court expounded:\r\n\r\n \r\n  \"Where the particular acts charged as a conspiracy are the same as those relied on as the tortious act or actionable wrong, plaintiff cannot recover damages for such act or wrong, and recover likewise on the conspiracy to do the act or wrong.\"\r\n\r\nTodd, 276 S.C. at 293, 278 S.E.2d at 611(quoting 15A C.J.S. Conspiracy Â§ 33 (1967)). \r\n\r\n Because Hoffman, like Todd, merely realleged the prior acts complained of in his other causes of action as a conspiracy action but failed to plead additional acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, he was not entitled to maintain his conspiracy cause of action. Additionally, we have affirmed Hoffman's damages under breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Hoffman is thus precluded from recovering additional damages under conspiracy for the same acts for which he obtained relief under these other causes of action.\r\n\r\nB. Punitive Damages\r\n\r\n Hoffman challenges the Master's denial of punitive damages. In this state, the award of punitive damages is controlled by statute. South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (Supp. 1999) provides: \"In any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing evidence.\" The trial judge has considerable discretion regarding the amount of damages both actual or punitive awarded. See Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996); Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991); Lister v. Nationsbank of Delaware, N.A., 329 S.C. 133, 494 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 1997). Because of this discretion, our review on appeal is limited to the correction of errors of law. Id. \r\n\r\n To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendants' conduct was willful, wanton, or undertaken in reckless disregard of plaintiff's rights. See McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996). Willfulness has been defined as a conscious failure to exercise due care. See Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n Hoffman specifically contends the Master erroneously based his ruling solely on the fact the capital call partners relied on the advice of counsel in reaching the decision to cease payments on the loan. The Master's order articulated:\r\n\r\n \r\n  The capital call partners took the action they did precisely for the reason that they knew Kuznik had no recourse against them. To the man they testified they knew their actions would have devastating legal consequences to Hoffman, their fellow partner. There is no \"punctilio of honor\" in that conduct or that way of thinking. The only reason that this court can find that men of standing in this community would act in such a way is because they were told it was legal to do so by their counsel. This fact alone restrains this court from imposing punitive damages against the partners for their actions taken against Hoffman.\r\n\r\n We hold advice of counsel is merely one factor to be considered in determining whether a defendant has acted willfully, wantonly, or recklessly. Despite the Master's assertion that a single fact restrained him from imposing punitive damages, we find an examination of the totality of the evidence in the record does not justify the imposition of punitive damages in this case. Hoffman's partners believed, whether correctly or incorrectly, there was some legal basis for their decision to stop payments on the loan. The partners relied on Meyer and the managing partners to guide them in business decisions regarding the Partnership. Meyer recommended the partners discontinue making payments. Although none of these factors excuses the partners' breach of their fiduciary duty and breach of the partnership agreement, they do support the Master's decision not to impose punitive damages. Consequently, we hold the Master did not abuse his discretion in declining to award punitive damages.\r\n\r\nC. Uniform Limited Partnership Act\r\n\r\n Hoffman claims the Master erred in dismissing his cause of action based on the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 33-42-10 to -2040 (1990 &amp; Supp. 1999). We disagree. Hoffman conceded the Partnership was a general rather than limited partnership. It was not subject to the requirements of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Hence, no cause of action may be sustained under the Act. We affirm the Master's dismissal of Hoffman's ULPA cause of action. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n We conclude the purchase money note from Kuznik was an obligation of the Partnership, even given its nonrecourse status. The partnership agreement did not provide the partners with the authority to default on their capital call payments, thereby allowing the property to enter foreclosure. By failing to make their capital calls and pay the debt owed to Kuznik, the partners breached the partnership agreement. \r\n\r\n The partners owed a fiduciary duty to Hoffman. Their decision to stop payment of capital calls and allow the property to be foreclosed caused harm to Hoffman. However, we rule a decision made by the partners in a general partnership may be protected by the business judgment rule. To receive protection under the business judgment rule, a party must meet the following criteria:\r\n\r\n  (1) The decision must be made in good faith;\r\n  (2) The decision must be made with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and\r\n  (3) The decision must be made in a manner the partner reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the partnership.\r\n\r\n The business judgment rule will not apply if the partner has engaged in self-dealing, fraud, or other unconscionable conduct. The action taken by the partners to stop payment on the note was in the interest of the capital call partners, but was to Hoffman's detriment. Partners are not to put their own interests above those of other partners. The decision made by the capital call partners is not protected by the business judgment rule. Concomitantly, we find the partners breached their fiduciary duty to Hoffman.\r\n\r\n Hoffman is entitled to indemnity under the terms of the partnership agreement. The payment of the deficiency judgment is in the course of the business of the partnership. Equitable subrogation is not sufficiently pled by pleading contractual indemnity. Hoffman failed to plead the required elements of equitable subrogation, and even if he had, he would not be able to recover. Under the doctrine of equitable subrogation, he would stand in the shoes of Kuznik, and since the note was nonrecourse, Kuznik had no claim against the Partnership or the individual partners.\r\n\r\n On Hoffman's counter appeal, we find secrecy is not an element of civil conspiracy. However, Hoffman is not entitled to recover under a claim for civil conspiracy, because it is based on the same acts for which he has already received relief. We hold there was no abuse of discretion by the Master in denying punitive damages. Accordingly, the decision of the Master is \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\n GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n1. The Brumley Company is a real estate development corporation.\r\n2. In addition to Hoffman, the partners were: Frank Brumley, Eric Meyer, Patrick McKinney, David Carr, Frances Finch, Greenbax Enterprises, Inc., Edward Manning, Hilton Head Equity Management Co., Inc., Evan Jones, Joseph Land, David Rawle, and Harris Thaxton.\r\n3.

At trial, Defendant, Lou Norris, moved for a directed verdict.  The Circuit Court granted his motion.  The jury returned a verdict against Norris and Associates and awarded $9,931.90 to Long.  Norris and Associates made a Rule 60(b), SCRCP motion to set aside the judgment.  It sought this relief stating a juror failed to honestly respond to the court's voir dire.  The Circuit Court agreed.  Long appeals both the trial court's issuance of the directed verdict and the order setting aside the judgment.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.  \r\n  FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  In the early morning hours of February 2, 1995, Carolyn Long was stirred from sleep by the blaring of her car alarm.  For Long, this was not an unusual event -- a cat occasionally triggered the alarm when climbing on the vehicle in a quest for warmth from the engine's radiating heat.  As she had done in the past, Long got up to go outside and turn off the alarm.  In this circumstance, however, instead of finding the feline, Long encountered a man unknown to her who was taking her automobile.  According to Long, the stranger pushed her to the ground and drove her car away.   Long reported the incident to the police that night.  The police, in turn, informed Long the car had been repossessed.   Long filed an action against Norris and Associates and Lou Norris, individually, for assault and battery arising out of Lou Norris' repossession of her automobile.(1)  Long sought both actual and punitive damages for the physical and emotional damages she claimed to have suffered because of Defendants' actions.  Lou Norris moved at the close of evidence that he \"be dropped or dismissed from [the] case as a defendant\" because \"at all times he was acting within his authority as an employed agent of Norris and Associates\" and that Long presented \"no evidence â€¦ [Lou Norris] acted outside of his capacity as an agent of [the business].\"  Over Long's objection, the judge granted the motion.   The case went to the jury against Norris and Associates.  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Long for $2,931.90 actual damages and $7,000 punitive damages.   The Circuit Court entered the judgment on May 12, 1998.  On June 1, 1998, Norris and Associates moved for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b),\r\nSCRCP.   Norris and Associates alleged, despite the Circuit Court's specific voir dire relating to the jury pool's experience with automobile repossession, it had confirmed juror Preston Anderson failed to reveal his vehicle was repossessed in 1996.  It submitted Anderson's credit report, which detailed the repossession, as support for its allegation.\r\nNorris and Associates investigated Anderson because he seemed to manifest a preference for Long during the trial.  Norris and Associates supplemented its post-trial motion by filing an affidavit of Wayne Alston, manager of Fidelity Financial Services.  Fidelity financed the automobile purportedly repossessed from Anderson.  Alston averred, inter alia, that:      Anderson once financed a car through Fidelity;  Anderson failed to make payments on the car;  Fidelity furnished Anderson with notice of right to cure before pursuing repossession, yet Anderson did not take steps to rectify the situation; and  Fidelity repossessed the car on June 24, 1996.   Fidelity secured a $5,079.02 deficiency judgment against Anderson after its sale of his car.  Anderson paid $100 toward the judgment.  Fidelity charged off the remainder.  Norris and Associates later filed an affidavit signed by Anderson.  In this document, Anderson admitted:     \"All of the statements made by Mr. Alston in [Alston's affidavit] regarding my car being repossessed are true and accurate\";  \"I was a customer of Fidelity Financial and when I fell behind in my car payments, my automobile was repossessed on June 24, 1996.\"; and  \"I was selected as a juror because I did not admit that my car had been repossessed.\"   (Emphasis added).  The Circuit Court set aside the judgment on the ground of Anderson's disqualification as a juror.  Long moved to alter or amend the trial court's order.  Accompanying her motion was a second affidavit by Anderson.  In that statement, characterized by Long as \"explanatory,\" Anderson declared he had mechanical problems with the car and discussed these difficulties with the dealer and the finance company when \"[f]inally we reached an agreement whereby I voluntarily turned the car in to the finance company.  The car was not repossessed by any repossession company.\"  Anderson professed he did not know \"why [he] did not hear or understand the question\" but he \"could be fair and impartial to both the Plaintiff and Defendant[s] in this case â€¦.\"  The Circuit Court denied Long's motion.  Long appeals: (1) the order setting aside the verdict, and (2) the judge's decision to dismiss Lou Norris as a party.  ISSUES      Did the Circuit Court properly grant Norris and Associates' motion for relief from judgment on the ground of juror disqualification?   Did the Circuit Court err in dismissing Lou Norris individually from the action?    STANDARD OF REVIEW   I.  Granting of a New Trial Due to Juror Failure\r\nto Honestly Respond to Voir Dire   The granting of a new trial based on a juror's failure to honestly respond to the court's voir dire remains within the sound discretion of the trial court.  Morris v. Jensen, 309 S.C. 153, 420 S.E.2d 710 (Ct. App. 1992).  A circuit judge's decision to issue such an order will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.  Id.   II. Directed Verdict  In ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591(1999); Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290,\r\n504 S.E.2d 347 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Weir v. Citicorp Nat'l Servs., Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 435 S.E.2d 864 (1993) (an appellate court must apply the same standard when reviewing the trial judge's decision on such motions).   When the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 514 S.E.2d 126 (1999).   If more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the jury.  Mullinax v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., Inc., 333 S.C. 89, 508 S.E.2d 848 (1998).  In ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence.  Jones v. General Elec. Co., 331 S.C. 351, 503 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1998).  The trial court can only be reversed when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.  Swinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 477, 514 S.E.2d at 130.  When reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, the appellate court should not ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.  Collins, 332 S.C. at 296, 504 S.E.2d at 350.  Rather, it must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in the opposing party's favor.  Jones, 331 S.C. at 356, 503 S.E.2d at 176; see also First State Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 385 S.E.2d 821 (1989) (in reviewing the granting of a directed verdict, the court should determine the elements of the action alleged and whether any evidence existed on each element).  LAW/ANALYSIS  I.  Relief from Judgment Based on Juror Disqualification  Long asserts the Circuit Court erred in granting the motion for relief from judgment based on juror disqualification.  We disagree.  A.  Counsel's Right to Truthful Answers From Jurors During Voir Dire  The leading case in South Carolina on this issue is State v. Gulledge, 277 S.C. 368, 287 S.E.2d 488 (1982).  Gulledge edifies:  Necessarily, it is expected and required that jurors in their answers shall be completely truthful and that they shall disclose, upon a general question, any matters which might tend to disqualify them from sitting on the case for any reason.  It therefore becomes imperative that the answers be truthful and complete.  False or misleading answers may result in the seating of a juror who might have been discharged by the Court, challenged for cause by counsel or stricken through the exercise of peremptory challenge.  Id. at 371, 287 S.E.2d at 490 (quoting Photostat Corp. v. Ball, 338 F.2d 783, 786 (10th Cir. 1964)).  Norris and Associates requested the Circuit Court make the following query during voir dire: \"Are any of you in the business of repossessing automobiles or\r\nhave any of you had an automobile that was repossessed?\"  (Emphasis added).  Two potential jurors responded in the affirmative to the court's question.  The court subsequently dismissed both people.(2)  Anderson, however, remained silent.  Because Anderson had an automobile repossessed in the past, he improperly allowed the Circuit Court to impanel him.  B.  Standard for Relief  In Gray v. Bryant, 298 S.C. 285, 379 S.E.2d 894 (1989), the Supreme Court recited the requirements for a new trial based upon the disqualification of a juror.  Specifically, a party must demonstrate:     the fact of disqualification;  the grounds for disqualification were unknown prior to verdict; and  the moving party was not negligent in failing to learn of the disqualification before verdict.   Id. at 288, 379 S.E.2d at 896 (citing Thompson v. O'Rourke, 288 S.C. 13, 339 S.E.2d 505 (1986)).  The circumstances in Gray are similar to those of the case sub judice inasmuch as both matters possess the element of juror nondisclosure during voir dire.  Gray featured a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action who sought to amend his motion for a new trial upon discovering a juror failed to honestly respond to the court's voir dire.  The trial court asked whether any juror: (1) had been a patient of defendant doctor; or (2) possessed any bias that would interfere with his or her ability to serve with fairness and impartiality.  The juror in question did not respond to either query and was seated.  However, plaintiff learned after trial the juror had: (1) been treated by defendant; and (2) written a letter lauding physicians and criticizing people who sue them, which a local newspaper published two weeks after the trial.  The record reviewed by the Gray Court showed the juror wrote the letter on the same day the jury rendered its verdict.  1.  Gray Analysis  a.  Fact of Disqualification  Norris and Associates specifically requested voir dire that delved into whether any potential juror ever had an automobile repossessed.  The Circuit Court assented and questioned the jury pool.  Indubitably, Norris and Associates were seeking to purge, or at least identify, those persons who lost the use and ownership of a car to a creditor.(3)\r\nTwo members of the jury pool acknowledged past repossessions.  Consequently, the judge disqualified the two from jury service.  Because the trial court excised the two potential jurors from the panel based on their repossession experiences, we find Anderson's disqualification was sufficiently established.  b.  Grounds for Disqualification Unknown  In the post-trial hearing, Norris and Associates asseverated it had no knowledge of Anderson's past vehicle repossession.  Long did not contest Norris and Associates' claim.  The Circuit Court held this element in the Gray test was undisputed.  We concur.  c.  Existence of Negligence in Failing to Identify  Juror's Disqualification Before Verdict  Long contends Defendants were negligent in failing to timely identify Anderson's disqualification.  Specifically, Long argues Defendants:     should have discovered the fact of disqualification sooner because Defendants could have obtained background information on the potential jurors before trial; and   were on notice of a potential problem with Anderson's service as a juror by their observation of Anderson's facial expressions during trial, which created their concern the juror was favoring Long.   We disagree.  i.  Need for Conducting Background Checks of Jurors  There were 200 to 300 persons summoned for jury service for the term in which the instant dispute was tried.  Because of this number, the Circuit Court found due diligence did not require Defendants to incur the significant expenses related to assembling information on every jury pool member's finances and credit history.  We concur.  To hold otherwise conceivably creates a burden on the trial bar to perform background checks in all jury selections to prevent the danger of juror disqualification.  While parties in matters with large stakes on the line may endeavor in scrutinizing their jury pools, pursuant to the rules of professional conduct and other applicable authorities, requiring the perscrutation of jurors' lives in every case would place an overwhelming onus on the parties.  This Court declines to expand the duty of parties and attorneys to include investigation of prospective jurors.  ii.  Norris and Associates' Promptness in\r\nInvestigating Its Concerns of Anderson  The Circuit Court found Norris and Associates acted with due diligence in its examination of Anderson's background following the trial.  We agree.  In a circumstance such as the one presented in the instant case, to require an attorney raise an objection to a juror's service during trial\r\nbased solely on the juror's facial expressions is an unreasonable expectation.   Defendants had no evidence during trial to support their concerns of Anderson; accordingly, they raised no contemporaneous objection.  Nevertheless, Norris and Associates promptly mobilized after judgment, discovered the truth about Anderson, and made a prompt Rule 60(b) motion for relief.  See S.C. Jur. Appeals and Error Â§ 81 (1992) (citing Stelter v. Keenan, 287 S.C. 389, 339 S.E.2d 116 (1986)) (\"If juror bias is suspected after the jury is impaneled, [the matter] should be raised at the first opportunity by proper motion â€¦.\").  In our judgment, Norris and Associates made a timely and proper objection to Anderson's service as a juror.  d.  Additional Criterion: Moving Party's Demonstration That\r\nConcealed Information Would Have Supported a Challenge  The right to a new trial in circumstances relating to improper juror silence during voir dire is not absolute.  Gray, 298 S.C. at 288, 379 S.E.2d at 896 (citing Thompson, 288 S.C. 13, 339 S.E.2d 505 (1986)).  As recounted in Gray:  &quot;[R]elief is required only when the court finds the concealed information would have supported a challenge for cause, or would have been a material factor in the use of the party's peremptory challenges.  The inquiry must focus on the character of the concealed information, not on the mere fact that a concealment occurred.\"  Id. (quoting Thompson, 288 S.C. at 15, 339 S.E.2d at 506 (1986)).  The Gray Court concluded the facts \"could have supported a challenge for cause or could have been a material factor in the use of the appellant's peremptory challenges.\"  In the case at bar, the trial court found the truth about Anderson's credit history could have supported Norris and Associates' challenges for cause or peremptory challenges.  We affirm the trial court's ruling.  C.  The Truth Telling Mandate of Voir Dire  A raison d'etre for the jury system in this country is to provide litigants the assurance of a fair and impartial trial.  See State v. Gulledge, 277 S.C. 368, 370, 287 S.E.2d 488, 489 (1982) (citing S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14 and U.S. Const. amend. VI) (\"It is fundamental that a defendant is entitled to a trial by an impartial jury.\").  It is the duty of every potential juror to make true and full disclosures during voir dire because counsel is entitled to rely on the answers in determining whether to exercise a peremptory strike.  The voir dire procedure is explicated:  Full knowledge of all relevant and material matters that might bear on the possible disqualification of a juror is essential to a fair and intelligent exercise of the right of counsel to challenge either for cause or peremptorily.  Juror concealment of material facts in response to questions bearing a substantial likelihood of uncovering a strong potential of juror bias undermines the peremptory challenge process â€¦.  Accordingly, it is the duty of a juror to make full and truthful answers to such questions as are asked, neither falsely stating any fact nor concealing any material matter.  The voir dire oath administered to jurors prior to their examination enjoins them to tell the complete and entire truth.  47 Am. Jur. 2d Jury Â§ 191 (1995) (footnotes omitted); see also id. at Â§ 189 (voir dire examination serves as a filtering process to screen out prospective jurors who are unable to put aside any personal opinions and base a decision on the evidence).  Long attempts to mend the damage caused by Anderson's nondisclosure with two arguments:  Citing State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811(1999), Long insists the Circuit Court should not have set aside the judgment without conducting a hearing to ascertain whether Anderson exhibited any bias that prejudiced Defendants.  Long's reliance on Aldret is misplaced.  The rule to which Long refers is limited solely to circumstances where the jury engages in premature deliberations.  Id. at 315-316, 509 S.E.2d at 815.  No premature deliberations occurred in the instant matter. Nevertheless, the Circuit Court conducted a hearing and determined Anderson had a vehicle repossessed and failed to respond to the voir dire question on this point.  Anderson admitted in his first affidavit the \"statements â€¦ regarding my car being repossessed are true and accurate.\"  However, Long asserts in her brief \"[t]he juror's vehicle was not repossessed\" because \"it was turned over to the finance company.\"  The question posed by the trial court concerned\r\nwhether the juror had ever had a vehicle repossessed, not the method used to effect the repossession.  A case with strikingly similar facts in regard to a juror response to voir dire posited by the trial court is\r\nState v. Woods, 338 S.C. 561, 527 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 2000).  In Woods, the judge\r\nasked \"if anyone was a 'friend or casual acquaintance with any of them or business associate or social acquaintance with any of them, [including] having been represented by any of them in the past.'\"  The trial court further inquired whether anyone was a \"contributor to or supporter of any organization which has as its primary function the promotion of law enforcement or protection of victims' rights such as MADD, SADD, CAVE, or the like ....\"  After the jury returned its verdict, but before sentencing, Woods' counsel told the court, \"I've just been informed that one of the jurors was actually a worker in the solicitor's office for a period of time and I don't recall her answering that question during the voir dire.\"  Woods moved for a new trial based on the \"after-discovered information.\"  Woods' counsel later said, \"[i]f we had known prior to the verdict coming in that she had been working in the victim's office, I would certainly have ... challenge[d] for cause or at the very least ... use[d] a peremptory challenge to try to keep her off the jury.\"  Woods had one peremptory challenge remaining when the juror's name was called.  In an attempt to justify the failure to respond to voir dire, the juror testified \"she did not recall the question being asked and, even if she did hear the question, 'it just didn't synchronize [sic].'\"  The trial court denied Woods' motion for new trial, determining the juror's failure to disclose was not intentional.  In reversing the trial court's decision, this Court concluded Woods was denied his constitutional right to have an impartial jury determine his guilt or innocence because the juror did not disclose information during voir dire questioning and the concealed information would have supported a challenge of cause.  Long relies upon State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998), contending Anderson's conduct was \"not intentional.\"  Kelly analyzed a scenario where there was juror questioning concerning a pamphlet \"God, Law, and Capital Punishment.\"  Kelly argued prospective jurors had been less than truthful when initially questioned under oath.  The trial judge did not find members of the jury where untruthful.  Our Supreme Court elucidates:  '[A new trial] is required only when the court finds the  [intentionally] concealed information would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material factor in the use of the party's peremptory challenges.   The inquiry must focus on the character of the concealed information, not on the mere fact that a concealment occurred.'  Thompson v. O'Rourke, 288 S.C. 13, 15, 339 S.E.2d 505, 506 (1986).   Using the juror disqualification analysis developed by this Court, our first question is whether Juror P intentionally concealed information in not revealing his past activities during voir dire.  Gray v. Bryant, 298 S.C. 285, 379 S.E.2d 894 (1989).  Id. at 146, 502 S.E.2d at 106-107.  We agree that the juror's lack of response in this case must rise to the level of \"intentionally concealed information.\"  Considering the facts available to us, especially the telling statements found in Anderson's first affidavit, we find Anderson\r\ndid not truthfully respond to the trial court about his 1996 automobile repossession.\r\nConcomitantly, in the interest of justice, in circumstances where:  (1) it is discovered a juror did not disclose a truthful answer in  response to voir dire;  (2) the juror's disqualification is discovered following trial;  (3) a truthful response could have supported a challenge for cause or  could have been a material factor in the use of a peremptory  challenge; and  (4) the Gray criteria have been satisfied,  the proper remedy for the injured party is a de novo trial.  Gray v. Bryant, 298 S.C. 285, 379 S.E.2d 894 (1989);\r\nsee also Shafer v. Schuster, 882 S.W.2d 310 (Mo.Ct. App. 1994), cited in Annotation, 66 C.J.S. New Trial Â§ 25 (1998) (in the case of a juror's intentional nondisclosure in response to voir dire, bias and prejudice are inferred, and a new trial is required).   II.  Dismissal of Lou Norris Individually from Action   Long maintains the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Lou Norris individually from the action.  She specifically argues she was entitled to proceed against both defendants, even if Lou Norris was acting on behalf of Norris and Associates in a representative capacity.  We agree.  Lou Norris was an agent of Norris and Associates and acting in the scope of his employment when he repossessed Long's car.  In circumstances where an agent has committed a tort against a third person, the agent's liability for the resulting damages is unaffected by the fact he was acting in a representative capacity.  Gilbert v. Mid-South Mach. Co., 267 S.C. 211, 227 S.E.2d 189 (1976); F. Patrick Hubbard and Robert L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 634 (2d ed. 1997) (footnotes omitted) (\"Vicarious liability does not eliminate the primary liability of the tortfeasor.\"); Restatement (Second) of Agency Â§ 217B(2) (1957) (\"Principal and agent can be joined in an action for a wrong resulting from the tortious conduct of an agent or that of agent and principal, and a judgment can be rendered against each.\").  The Circuit Court's dismissal of Lou Norris was erroneous.  Norris and Associates concedes in its brief to this Court that \"Lou Norris should have remained a named party in his individual capacity.\"  Notwithstanding this, it contends:     Long did not preserve the issue for review; or, in the alternative,  the alleged error was harmless because the case was fully litigated as though Lou Norris had not been dismissed from the suit.   We find no merit to either of Norris and Associates' arguments.  A.  Long's Efforts to Preserve the Issue  Examination of the pertinent exchanges between the parties and the trial court reveals Long objected to Lou Norris' dismissal:  Lou Norris' Counsel: Your Honor, we â€¦ move â€¦ that Lou Norris      individually be dropped or dismissed from this case as      a defendant.  There's been no evidence that he acted      outside of his capacity as an agent of Norris and      Associates, and that's the only allegations [sic] that      are in the pleadings.(4)  That at all times he was acting      within his authority as an employed agent of Norris      and Associates, Inc., and without anything keeping      him in individually, you know, I think it's proper that      he be dismissed and this action go forward against      Norris and Associates, Inc. only.  Long's Counsel:  [T]he only thing that we have is the pleadings[,] which      admit that [Norris] was an agent and the testimony[,]      which say that he was the one that did it, and his      denial of doing it.(5) So, if he's the one that did it,      he did it individually.  . . . .  The Court:   [T]here's no factual dispute established by the      pleadings of this case that [Lou Norris] was not acting      as an agent of the company.  So, I would dismiss him\r\nindividually.  (Emphasis added).   To properly preserve an issue for review, the litigant must make a contemporaneous objection.  Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. 352, 488 S.E.2d 878 (Ct. App. 1997).  The objection must be ruled on by the trial judge.  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998).  A party is not required to harass the trial judge with repetitive objections when an intelligible one has been made.\r\nSee State v. Higgenbottom, 337 S.C. 637, 640-641, 525 S.E.2d 250, 251 (Ct. App. 1999) (quoting State v. McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 37, 462 S.E.2d 882, 884 (Ct. App.1995) (\"So long as the judge had an opportunity to rule on an issue, and did so, it was 'not incumbent upon â€¦ counsel to harass the judge by parading the issue before him again.'\")).\r\nIrrefutably, Long preserved the issue.  B.  Lou Norris' Dismissal as Harmless Error  Norris and Associates propose as an alternative argument that this Court should view Lou Norris' dismissal as harmless error because Long did not demonstrate any prejudice by the judge's decision.  We need not address this argument because the Circuit Court dismissed Lou Norris in contravention of the laws of agency and tort.  We reverse the trial court's dismissal of Lou Norris from the action in his individual capacity.  CONCLUSION   We hold the voir dire oath mandates that a prospective juror tell the entire truth.  A juror's lack of honesty and candor during voir dire is a violation of his oath, as well as a barrier to a party's efforts in identifying potential jurors who harbor a bias.\r\nJuror concealment of material facts during voir dire is anathema to justice.  We affirm the order of the Circuit Court setting aside the verdict in this case based on juror disqualification.  A person is liable to others for his own tortious conduct.  This responsibility is unaffected by the fact that the tortfeasor was acting in a representative capacity.  We reverse the trial court's dismissal of Lou Norris as an individual defendant.  This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for a new trial with both Norris and  Associates and Lou Norris, individually, as defendants.  AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.  GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.   1.   Long also alleged conversion, but she abandoned this claim at trial.  2.   We note the transcript from the Rule 60(b) hearing indicates a third juror was excused by the court because his father worked for Ford Motor Credit Company. 3.   As the trial court recognized in its order to set aside the judgment, Defendants' desired voir dire was proper and material to the action because the case arose out of the repossession of Long's car.  4.  Long's Complaint contains the following allegation:  3. That when the Plaintiff went to her vehicle to turn the alarm off, she  was violently and negligently assaulted by the Defendant, Lou Norris,  acting within the course and scope of his duty as an agent of the  Defendant, Norris and Associates, Ltd. 5.  Defendants' Answer includes the following admission:  3. Only so much of paragraph 3 is admitted as alleges that the Defendant, Lou    Norris, was acting within the course and scope of his employment as an agent of the    Defendant, Norris and Associates, Ltd.  The remainder of the paragraph is denied.   \r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3244","title":"Jackson v.

We affirm.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1994, as Jackson stood by the open door of a vehicle parked beside a gas pump at a\r\n\r\nservice station, another vehicle struck the car and then drove off.  The impact caused the car door to\r\n\r\nhit Jackson and, as a result, she suffered head and facial injuries.  Jackson did not know who was\r\n\r\ndriving the other car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 17, 1997, Jackson filed her initial action against the unknown driver pursuant to the statutory\r\n\r\nscheme established by state law.(1)  John Doe answered the complaint and alleged that \"[t]he parties\r\n\r\nto this matter know the identity of John Doe and the Defendant, John Doe, asks for this case to be\r\n\r\ndismissed.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost four and a half years after the accident, on September 15, 1998, Jackson was allowed by the\r\n\r\ncourt to amend her complaint to add Milligan as a defendant.  The attorney representing John Doe\r\n\r\nagreed to the amendment.  The amended complaint retained John Doe as a named party and\r\n\r\nidentified him as an unknown driver, but then added Milligan in the caption as an additional\r\n\r\ndefendant.  The complaint also alleged that \"the Defendant, John Doe, may have been identified\r\n\r\nand, upon information and belief, his name is COSTELLO MILLIGAN.\"  Milligan answered the amended\r\n\r\ncomplaint, offering a general denial but specifically denying the paragraph that alleged John Doe\r\n\r\nhad been identified as Costello Milligan.  Milligan also asserted certain affirmative defenses,\r\n\r\ncontending the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and, also, that the relation\r\n\r\nback provisions of Rule 15(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply in this\r\n\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilligan then moved for summary judgment on the grounds of the affirmative defenses asserted in his\r\n\r\nanswer.  The trial court ruled in favor of Milligan, concluding that the relation back provision of Rule\r\n\r\n15(c) did not apply and that the statute of limitations had expired. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n\r\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Cafe Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross,\r\n\r\n305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991).  \"Our standard of review in evaluating a motion for summary\r\n\r\njudgment is to liberally construe the record in favor of the nonmoving party and give the nonmoving\r\n\r\nparty the benefit of all favorable inferences that might reasonably be drawn therefrom.\"  Estes&nbsp;v.\r\n\r\nRoper Temp. Servs., Inc., 304 S.C. 120, 121, 403 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1991).  Moreover, summary\r\n\r\njudgment is a drastic remedy which \"'should be cautiously invoked so that no person will be\r\n\r\nimproperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.'\"  Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,\r\n\r\n306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (quoting Watson v. Southern Ry. Co., 420 F. Supp 483, 486\r\n\r\n(D.S.C. 1975)). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJackson argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Milligan.  She contends that\r\n\r\nserving John Doe was the equivalent of serving Milligan and the service of process on John Doe tolled\r\n\r\nthe applicable statute of limitations as to Milligan.  We disagree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-180 permits an injured party to file suit against an unknown owner\r\n\r\nor driver of a vehicle providing the injured party a means to collect uninsured motorist's coverage. \r\n\r\nThat same section specifically allows the institution of an action against the real tortfeasor if his identity\r\n\r\nthereafter becomes known.(2)  However, there is no provision specifically allowing John Doe and a\r\n\r\nlater added or substituted party to be considered the same entity for purposes of tolling the statute of\r\n\r\nlimitations.  That fact, coupled with the fact that there is no mention of the statute of limitations and its\r\n\r\nrelationship to any subsequent action against a later identified tortfeasor, leads to the inescapable\r\n\r\nconclusion that each statute must be separately construed and enforced according to its plain\r\n\r\nlanguage.  See City of Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union, 323 S.C. 384, 387-88, 475 S.E.2d 747,\r\n\r\n749 (1996) (\"Where the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to\r\n\r\ntheir literal meaning.\"); Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 436-37, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892\r\n\r\n(1995) (opining that when statutory language is clear, this court has \"no right to look for or impose\r\n\r\nanother meaning,\" or \"resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a\r\n\r\nstatute's scope.\"); Ariail v. Ariail, 29 S.C. 84, 93, 7 S.E. 35, 40 (1888) (\"The statute of limitations may\r\n\r\nsometimes work a great hardship in special cases; but under the principle that litigation and\r\n\r\ncontention must have an ending, and that the repose and quiet of the many compensates for the\r\n\r\nloss of the few, such statutes have been adopted and strictly enforced in most countries, as wise, and\r\n\r\nas contributing to the best interests of society.  Such is the doctrine in this state.\"); Adkins v. Comcar\r\n\r\nIndus., Inc., 316 S.C. 149, 151-52, 447 S.E.2d 228, 230 (Ct. App. 1994) (explaining that an appellate court\r\n\r\n\"has no legislative powers.  Our sole function is to determine and, within constitutional limits, give\r\n\r\neffect to the intention of the legislature while the responsibility for the justice or wisdom of legislation\r\n\r\nrests exclusively with the legislature, whether or not we agree with the laws it enacts.\"  (internal\r\n\r\ncitation omitted)), aff'd, 323 S.C. 409, 475 S.E.2d 762 (1996).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia recently ruled on a similar case.  In Rivera v. Witt, 512 S.E.2d 558 (Va.\r\n\r\n1999), the Virginia court distinguished its earlier decision of Truman v. Spivey, 302 S.E.2d 517 (Va. 1983). \r\n\r\nIn the Truman case, the court determined that its John Doe statute treated both a John Doe\r\n\r\ndefendant and a later identified uninsured defendant as one entity.  In Rivera, the only distinction was\r\n\r\nthat the later identified tortfeasor who was originally sued as John Doe was an insured motorist.  The\r\n\r\nRivera court concluded, \"there is nothing in the uninsured motorist statute which suggests that, under\r\n\r\nthe facts of this case, Doe and Witt should be treated as the same entity; therefore, the statute of\r\n\r\nlimitations applies to each of them individually.\"  Id. at 560.(3)  While not controlling on this court, the\r\n\r\nreasoning of the Virginia court is persuasive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the allied question of whether Jackson's amendment related back to her original\r\n\r\ncomplaint.  Milligan argued, and the circuit court agreed, that the relation back provision of Rule\r\n\r\n15(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure did not save Jackson's cause of action against\r\n\r\nMilligan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 15(c) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,\r\n\r\ntransaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleadings, the\r\n\r\namendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing\r\n\r\nprovision is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action against him\r\n\r\nthe party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action\r\n\r\nthat he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have\r\n\r\nknown that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have\r\n\r\nbeen brought against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 15(c), SCRCP.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been few South Carolina decisions discussing Rule 15(c), and none dispositive of the case\r\n\r\nbefore us.  In Hughes v. Water World Water Slide, Inc., 314 S.C. 211, 442 S.E.2d 584 (1994), our supreme\r\n\r\ncourt considered whether an amendment that corrected the name of the corporate defendant\r\n\r\nrelated back to the filing of the original complaint.  The Hughes court, quoting Schiavone v. Fortune,\r\n\r\n477 U.S. 21, 29 (1986), adopted a four-part test to aid in interpreting the requirements of Rule 15(c). \r\n\r\nThus, Rule 15(c) requires:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)  the basic claim must have arisen out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading; (2) the party\r\n\r\nto be brought in must have received such notice that it will not be prejudiced in maintaining its\r\n\r\ndefense; (3) that party must or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning identity, the\r\n\r\naction would have been brought against it; and (4) the second and third requirements must have\r\n\r\nbeen fulfilled within the prescribed limitations period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHughes, 314 S.C. at 214, 442 S.E.2d at 586.  In Hughes, the court ruled, under the particular facts and\r\n\r\ncircumstances of that case, an amendment correcting a mistake in the defendant's corporate name\r\n\r\nrelated back to the initial commencement of the action.  Id. at 215, 442 S.E.2d at 586.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, Jackson did not simply correct the defendant's name or substitute one defendant for another. \r\n\r\nRather, she added Milligan as a defendant because he may have been the driver.  The language of\r\n\r\nRule 15(c) clearly speaks to a change in party, not the addition of a defendant to an already existing\r\n\r\ndefendant.  In our view, the addition of a party is not the same as a substitution or change of party. \r\n\r\nSee Kraly v. Vannewkirk, 635 N.E.2d 323 (Ohio 1994) (determining that Ohio's Rule 15(c), which is similar\r\n\r\nto our Rule 15(c), allows for relation back when a party is substituted but not when a party is added\r\n\r\nwhile retaining a party named in the original suit).  But see Harding v. Godwin, 518 S.E.2d 910 (Ga. Ct.\r\n\r\nApp. 1999) (noting the Georgia relationship back statute, which contains essentially the same\r\n\r\nlanguage as our Rule 15(c), authorizes the addition of a new party under certain circumstances if the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the statute are strictly met), cert. denied (Oct. 22, 1999).  Had Jackson substituted(4)\r\n\r\nMilligan for John Doe or simply corrected the name of the defendant, then the amendment should\r\n\r\nhave been analyzed in light of the requirements of Rule 15(c) as set forth in Hughes for a\r\n\r\ndetermination of whether the amended complaint properly related back to Jackson's original action. \r\n\r\nAlthough we sympathize with the dilemma faced by Jackson--if she erroneously substituted Milligan\r\n\r\nfor John Doe and dismissed the John Doe action, she would be left with no defendant--under the\r\n\r\nparticular facts and circumstances of this case,(5) we decline to expand the plain language of the rule\r\n\r\nand our current case law.  See Green v. Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. 303, 443 S.E.2d 906 (1994)\r\n\r\n(opining that in interpreting the language of a court rule, we should look to the plain and ordinary\r\n\r\nmeaning of the rule's words without limiting or expanding the rule).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOREHEAD, A.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., (Dissenting): Because I believe Jackson's amended complaint relates back to the\r\n\r\noriginal cause of action under Rule 15(c), SCRCP, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority analyzes Jackson's amendment as one which adds a party to the action instead of\r\n\r\nchanging the party to the action.  While on its face the amended complaint indicates John Doe and\r\n\r\nCostello Milligan are two separate individuals, the third paragraph of the amended complaint asserts\r\n\r\nthat John Doe and Milligan are \"upon information and belief\" the same person.  At trial, Jackson will\r\n\r\nbe required to prove that Milligan is in fact John Doe.  If Jackson is successful in this, her amendment\r\n\r\nclearly  will be one which substituted a party rather than an amendment  adding a new party.  The\r\n\r\nvalidity of Jackson's strategy in retaining Doe as a defendant is borne out by Milligan's allegation in his\r\n\r\nanswer that he is not John Doe.  Moreover, the applicable statute states that \"an action may be\r\n\r\ninstituted against an unknown defendant as 'John Doe.' \"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-77-180 (1989). \r\n\r\nTherefore, by the plain language of the statute Milligan and Doe are the same person if the jury finds\r\n\r\nMilligan to be the tortfeasor.  Nevertheless, the majority \"decline[s] to expand the plain language of\r\n\r\nthe rule\" to allow the amendment to relate back to the original cause of action.  I would not be so\r\n\r\nreticent under the peculiar facts of this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 15(c)'s purpose, as articulated by the South Carolina Supreme Court, is to salvage causes of\r\n\r\naction otherwise barred by the statute of limitations.  Thomas v. Grayson, 318 S.C. 82, 88, 456 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n377, 380 (1995).  \"The test to be used in determining whether or not an amendment should be allowed\r\n\r\nto relate back under Rule 15(c) to the date of the original pleading to avoid the statute of limitations,\r\n\r\nis found in the language of the Rule; specifically, whether the claim or defense asserted in the\r\n\r\namended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the original\r\n\r\npleading.\"  Id.  Once litigation involving particular conduct or a given occurrence has been instituted,\r\n\r\nthe parties are not entitled to the protection of the statute of limitations against the later assertion\r\n\r\nwhen the claim arises out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as set forth in the original\r\n\r\npleading.  Id.  at 88, 456 S.E.2d at 377, citing 6A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice\r\n\r\nand Procedure Â§ 1496 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority relies upon Hughes v. Water World Water Slide, Inc., 314 S.C. 211, 442 S.E.2d 584 (1994), to\r\n\r\ninterpret  Rule 15(c), and notes that Hughes adopted a four-part test from Schiavone v. Fortune, 477\r\n\r\nU.S. 21, 29 (1986), to aid in interpreting the requirements of Rule 15(c), SCRCP.  While the South\r\n\r\nCarolina Supreme Court approved of the four-prong analysis set forth in Schiavone, it disagreed with\r\n\r\nthe result reached there and proceeded to adopt a more liberal construction of Rule 15(c) than the\r\n\r\nUnited States Supreme Court.  Specifically, the court found  the result in Schiavone inconsistent with\r\n\r\nRule 8(f), SCRCP, which requires that \"all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice to\r\n\r\nall parties.\"  Hughes, 314 S.C. at 214, 442 S.E.2d at 586.  In doing so, the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n\r\nfound that the fourth Schiavone prong had been satisfied where the pleadings described an event\r\n\r\nwhich occurred, inter alia, in the presence of the president of the misnamed corporate defendant. \r\n\r\nId. at 215, 442 S.E.2d at 586.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, all four of the Schiavone prongs were established.  The claim against Milligan arose out of the\r\n\r\nconduct set forth in the original pleading.  Milligan, if he is John Doe as Jackson maintains, had notice\r\n\r\nof the claim and cannot be heard to claim prejudice when his own actions in leaving the scene\r\n\r\nnecessitated the bringing of a \"John Doe\" action.  Milligan, if he is John Doe, should have known that,\r\n\r\nbut for his actions in leaving the scene, the action would have been brought against him in the first\r\n\r\ninstance.  Finally, if Milligan is indeed John Doe, he acquired the knowledge required in the second\r\n\r\nand third Schiavone prongs within the prescribed limitations period.  Just as the South Carolina\r\n\r\nSupreme Court found Schiavone's fourth prong satisfied in Hughes, where the event occurred in the\r\n\r\npresence of the corporate defendant's president, I would hold it satisfied here where Milligan, if he is\r\n\r\nproved at trial to be John Doe, was present when Jackson's injury occurred.  Allowing the amended\r\n\r\npleading to relate back will work substantial justice to all parties and is consistent with the liberal\r\n\r\nconstruction of Rule 15(c) adopted by our supreme court in Hughes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I would reverse the circuit court order and remand the case for a disposition on the\r\n\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-180 (1989).  \r\n\r\n3.  In 1999, Virginia's uninsured motorist's statute was amended.  It now provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bringing of an action against an unknown owner or operator as John Doe shall toll the statute of limitations for purposes\r\n\r\nof bringing an action against the owner or operator who caused the injury or damages until his identity becomes known.

Although represented by\r\ndifferent counsel, the uninsured motorist carrier and Milligan's carrier are,\r\nserendipitously, the same. Because Milligan's answer denied he was John Doe as a\r\nmatter of fact, he is judicially estopped from asserting otherwise in the\r\nproceeding against John Doe which remains a viable cause of action.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3245","title":"State v.

Pittman was indicted for resisting arrest, which stemmed from an arrest for public disorderly\r\n\r\nconduct.  The trial judge dismissed the resisting arrest charge.  The State appeals.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1998, Pittman was a passenger in a van stopped by Officer Johnny Martin with the York County Sheriff's\r\n\r\nDepartment.   While Officer Martin was talking with the driver, he noticed Pittman reach under the seat.  Officer Martin,\r\n\r\nunsure if Pittman was reaching for a weapon, asked Pittman to step out of the vehicle.  Officer Martin testified:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe acted like he didn't want to get out.  He said he wouldn't get out.  He finally got out.  He was grossly intoxicated,\r\n\r\nbecame very loud and boisterous, basically disorderly.  At that time I placed him under arrest for public disorderly conduct\r\n\r\nand he was placed in the back of the patrol car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficer Martin transported the driver and Pittman to the York County Detention Center.  En route to the jail, Pittman\r\n\r\nbecame very angry.  He threatened Officer Martin, stating he was a kick-boxer and would get even with Officer Martin once\r\n\r\nhe got out of  jail.  Pittman kicked the shields of the windows on the patrol car.  Officer Martin stopped the car, walked\r\n\r\naround to the passenger side, and opened the back door.  Pittman was still kicking so Martin sprayed him with O.C. spray. \r\n\r\nPittman kicked the door open, exited the patrol car, and kicked Officer Martin in the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a pre-trial hearing, Pittman moved to dismiss the resisting arrest charge.  He claimed his initial arrest for public\r\n\r\ndisorderly conduct was unlawful and, therefore, the resisting arrest charge was unlawful.  Officer Martin testified in camera. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge granted the motion to dismiss.  The State appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in dismissing the charge of resisting arrest and in refusing to allow the State to present evidence to the\r\n\r\njury regarding probable cause for the underlying arrest of  Pittman for public disorderly conduct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends the trial judge erred in dismissing the resisting arrest charge and \"in foreclosing the State from presenting\r\n\r\nevidence to the jury that there was probable cause for the underlying arrest of [Pittman] for public disorderly conduct.\"  We\r\n\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPittman's basis for the motion to dismiss was: (1) Pittman used profanity and was loud and boisterous only to the police\r\n\r\nofficers, which is not grounds, according to State v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991), for public disorderly\r\n\r\nconduct under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530 (1985); and (2) any gross intoxication observed was while Pittman was a\r\n\r\npassenger in a vehicle and thus did not satisfy Â§ 16-17-530.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 16-17-530 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny person who shall (a) be found on any highway or at any public place or public gathering in a grossly intoxicated\r\n\r\ncondition or otherwise conducting himself in a disorderly or boisterous manner, (b) use obscene or profane language on any\r\n\r\nhighway or at any public place or gathering or in hearing distance of any schoolhouse or church . . . shall be deemed guilty of\r\n\r\na misdemeanor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPittman asserts his use of profane, loud, and boisterous language was directed solely at the officers and in opposition to\r\n\r\npolice action.  Pittman claims that, because of this, the officer had no ground to arrest him.  Pittman relies on State v.\r\n\r\nPerkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;[T]he First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.\"  City of\r\n\r\nHouston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2505, 96 L.Ed.2d 398, 412 (1987).   The State may not punish a person\r\n\r\nfor voicing an objection to a police officer where no \"fighting words\" are used.  Norwell v. Cincinnati, 414 U.S. 14, 94 S.Ct.\r\n\r\n187, 38 L.Ed.2d 170 (1973). . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . [W]e conclude appellants cannot be punished under Â§ 16-17-530(a) for voicing their objections to sheriff's officers where\r\n\r\nthe record indicates no use of fighting words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerkins, 306 S.C. at 354-55, 412 S.E.2d at 386.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree that if Pittman's only disorderly behavior had been to use profanity, or to complain about Officer Martin removing\r\n\r\nhim from the vehicle, he could not be arrested for public disorderly conduct.  However, that was not the extent of Pittman's\r\n\r\nbehavior according to Officer Martin's testimony.  Officer Martin declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pittman] was grossly intoxicated, became very loud and boisterous, basically disorderly.  At that time I placed him\r\n\r\nunder arrest for public disorderly conduct . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . As far as the statements or anything he made at that time as far as being loud and boisterous, I can't testify to what\r\n\r\nactually he said, but he was very loud, boisterous, basically grossly intoxicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following exchange occurred when Officer Martin was cross-examined by defense counsel:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. So what's the first thing you said to Mr. Pittman when you approached the passenger door of the van?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. I advised him to get out of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Did he ultimately get out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. After a few minutes he did, yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Did he at first tell you he did not want to get out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Yes, sir, he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Did he say he had been drinking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. He advised that he did not want to get out of the vehicle, and he didn't have to.  I advised he did have to because he was\r\n\r\nreaching under the front seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Did he tell you he had been drinking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. It was very obvious he had been drinking, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officer's decision to arrest Pittman for public disorderly conduct under Â§ 16-17-530 was based on more than just his\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Review of the testimony presented reveals the arrest was also grounded upon the gross intoxication of Pittman in\r\n\r\na public place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense counsel argued because Officer Martin knew Pittman was intoxicated while a passenger in a vehicle, as opposed to\r\n\r\nstanding or walking on the street, Pittman could not be charged with a violation of Â§ 16-17-530.  During the hearing, defense\r\n\r\ncounsel produced  the supplemental incident report filed by Officer Martin which read: \"Subject two [Pittman] was\r\n\r\nintoxicated.  Reporting officer asked subject to get out of the vehicle.  Subject two got out of the vehicle and became very\r\n\r\nloud and disorderly.\"  Pittman's counsel maintained: \"So the intoxication he talks about was while he was in the car and I\r\n\r\ndon't believe he can be charged with intoxication while in the car.\"  The State contended that even if the arrest failed under\r\n\r\nState v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991), it would still be valid under the grossly intoxicated portion\r\n\r\nof the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Galloway, 305 S.C. 258, 407 S.E.2d 662 (Ct. App. 1991), this Court, addressing a situation similar to the case at\r\n\r\nbar, upheld the applicability of the public disorderly conduct statute to an intoxicated passenger riding in an automobile.  The\r\n\r\nCourt explained the facts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon stopping Mann's vehicle, Deputy Burriss arrested Mann for driving while under the influence, possession of marijuana,\r\n\r\nand driving under suspension as an habitual offender.  He asked Galloway, who was seated in the front passenger seat, to\r\n\r\nremain in the car.   Nonetheless, Galloway attempted repeatedly to get out of the car and in the process tossed a beer can\r\n\r\nand a plastic cup on the road.   Galloway ultimately did get out of the car against Deputy Burriss's instructions, at which time\r\n\r\nthe deputy observed him to be obviously intoxicated and unable to drive.   Burriss instructed him to get back into the car and\r\n\r\nwait.   He then called for a wrecker to remove the car.   At that point he did not intend to arrest Galloway, although he was\r\n\r\ngoing to ticket Galloway for possession of an open alcoholic beverage container in a vehicle and for littering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy Porter arrived at the scene to assist Burriss.   Burriss continued with Mann's arrest, and while writing the car's serial\r\n\r\nnumber on a tow sheet, Galloway mumbled something to him.   Burriss then went to the passenger side of the car and began\r\n\r\npicking up the beer can and cup.   Galloway shouted obscene names at him and made repeated statements replete with vulgar\r\n\r\nexpletives.   Burriss then advised him he was under arrest and at least twice asked him to step out of the car.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGalloway, 305 S.C. at 260-61, 407 S.E.2d at 664.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts in the case sub judice are slightly, but not significantly, different from those in Galloway.  Galloway exited the\r\n\r\nvehicle voluntarily and set foot on the highway.  However, the officer did not arrest him at that time for disorderly conduct. \r\n\r\nGalloway returned to the vehicle and began berating the officers with vulgar language and expletives.  Galloway was then\r\n\r\narrested for a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530 and later charged with resisting arrest.  On appeal from his\r\n\r\nconviction for resisting arrest, Galloway argued the trial judge erred in denying his motion for directed verdict on the\r\n\r\nresisting arrest charge because there was no evidence the officers had probable cause to arrest him for the underlying offense\r\n\r\nof disorderly conduct.  The Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed in the light most favorable to the State, the officers' testimony established the existence of probable cause to arrest\r\n\r\nGalloway.  See State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 260 S.E.2d 705 (1979).\r\nTheir evidence showed that Galloway was not\r\n\r\nonly on the highway in a grossly intoxicated state, but also that he was conducting himself in a\r\n\r\nboisterous manner and using obscene and profane language.  The judge, therefore, properly denied the motion\r\n\r\nfor directed verdict.  See State v. Mathis, 287 S.C. 589, 340 S.E.2d 538 (1986).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGalloway, 305 S.C. at 263, 407 S.E.2d at 665 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough our Supreme Court decided Perkins after this Court decided Galloway, the law established in Galloway has not\r\n\r\nbeen overruled and was not invalidated by the Perkins holding.  Perkins requires more than profanity or loud and boisterous\r\n\r\nbehavior directed at the officers.  The decision in Galloway makes clear it was based on the fact that Galloway was\r\n\r\nboisterous, using obscenities, and grossly intoxicated. Furthermore, \"the authorities are ample in support of [the]\r\n\r\nproposition\" that \"a person inside of his automobile on a public street is in a 'public place' within the meaning of . . .\r\n\r\n[disorderly conduct] ordinance[s].\"  People v. Johnson, 162 N.W.2d 667, 669 (Mich. Ct. App. 1968).  See also Miles v.\r\n\r\nState, 216 N.E.2d 847 (Ind. 1966)(defendant who was in cab of truck with window open, parked three or four feet from\r\n\r\ntraveled portion of busy highway, was in a \"public place\" within statute prohibiting being intoxicated in public place).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530 applies to a grossly intoxicated passenger riding in a vehicle \"on any\r\n\r\nhighway.\"(1)  Section 16-17-530 makes it a crime for any person to be \"on any highway or at any public place . .\r\n\r\n. in a grossly intoxicated condition or otherwise conducting himself in a disorderly or boisterous manner.\"  This\r\n\r\nSection is not limited to the use of an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  The quiddity of the\r\n\r\noffense is not the operation of a motor vehicle or the presence of the defendant in the motor vehicle while intoxicated, but is\r\n\r\nthe act of being on any highway or at any public place in a grossly intoxicated condition.  If a defendant is grossly intoxicated\r\n\r\nwhile riding in an automobile on a public highway, he is guilty of a violation of Â§ 16-17-530.  The fact that the defendant is\r\n\r\nnot driving the automobile does not affect the charge under this section.  Further, an individual may be charged with public\r\n\r\ndisorderly conduct whether he is a pedestrian or a passenger in a vehicle, if the individual is grossly intoxicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the State presented sufficient evidence to support an arrest under Â§ 16-17-530.  Officer Martin's testimony\r\n\r\nestablishes Pittman was arrested for both his language and for being grossly intoxicated.  The charge of public disorderly\r\n\r\nconduct and the subsequent resulting charge of resisting arrest should have been presented to the jury.  The trial court erred\r\n\r\nin granting Pittman's motion to dismiss the resisting arrest charge.  Accordingly, the judge's ruling granting the motion to\r\n\r\ndismiss is reversed and the case is remanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
