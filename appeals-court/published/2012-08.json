BMW argues the trial court erred in (1)\r\ndetermining its insurance coverage was not triggered by damage to its cars; (2)\r\ndetermining Colony did not act in bad faith in denying BMW's claim; (3)\r\n\ndetermining the policy Colony issued to BMW was not illusory; and (4) dismissing\r\nits motion to compel as moot. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 2006, Colony issued a Garage Insurance Policy (the Policy) to\r\nComplete Auto Recon Services, Inc. (CARS), under which CARS was the only\r\nnamed insured. The Policy included both \"Liability\" and \"Garage Keepers\"\r\ncoverage. Under \"Liability\" the coverage included \"all sums an 'insured' legally\r\nmust pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which [the\r\ninsurance applied] caused by an 'accident' and resulting from 'garage operations'\r\nother than the ownership, maintenance or use of covered 'autos'\" and \"all sums an\r\n'insured' legally must pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property\r\ndamage' to which [the insurance applied] caused by an 'accident' and resulting from\r\n'garage operations' involving the ownership, maintenance or use of 'covered\r\nautos.'\" Within the \"Garage Keepers\" coverage, the Policy provided for two\r\ndifferent types of coverage labeled \"Comprehensive\" and \"Collision.\" Generally,\r\nthe \"Garage Keepers\" coverage provided the insurer would:\r\n\r\n      pay all sums the \"insured\" legally must pay as damages for\r\n      \"loss\" to a \"customer's auto\" or \"customer's auto\" equipment\r\n      left in the \"insured's\" care while the \"insured\" is attending,\r\n      servicing, repairing, parking or storing it in your \"garage\r\n      operations\" under:\r\n\r\n      a.\t   Comprehensive Coverage \n\r\n            From Any cause except: \n\r\n            (1)\t      The \"customer's auto's\" collision with another\r\n                      object; or\r\n            (2)\t      The \"customer's auto's\" overturn . . .\r\n      c.    \t ollision Coverage\r\n            C                       \n\r\n            Caused By:          \n\r\n            (1)\t      The \"customer's auto's\" collision with another\r\n                      object; or\r\n            (2)\t      The \"customer's auto's\" overturn.\r\n\r\nThe Policy also included an endorsement naming BMW as an additional insured.\r\nThe endorsement provided in pertinent part, \"Under LIABILITY COVERAGE\r\nWHO IS AN INSURED is changed to include [BMW], but only for liability\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               \r\n \r\n\narising out of the ownership, maintenance and use of that part of the described\r\npremises which is leased to [CARS].\" The endorsement did not mention any other\r\ntypes of coverage, nor did the Policy include any further endorsements with respect\r\nto BMW.\r\n\r\nDuring this same time period, BMW entered into a service agreement with CARS\r\nunder which CARS provided washing and maintenance services on a fleet of\r\nBMW vehicles used at a BMW test track. On May 3, 2007, one of CARS's\r\nemployees left the windows to six BMW vehicles (the Vehicles) open during a\r\nsevere rain storm. As a result, the Vehicles suffered property damage totaling\r\n$601,720 and BMW filed a claim for the damage to the Vehicles to Colony. After\r\nBMW filed the claim, Colony investigated and declined to make payment in a July\r\n12, 2007 letter. On September 16 and 28, 2007, BMW followed up with two\r\nletters requesting Colony to pay its claim, citing reprimands issued to two CARS\r\nemployees and sufficient notice of the severe storms to protect the vehicles. In\r\nOctober 2007, Colony again reviewed BMW's claim. Subsequently, BMW filed\r\nsuit against CARS for breach of contract under their service agreement and\r\nnegligence for failing to secure the windows to the Vehicles.1 BMW also sued\r\nColony alleging breach of an insurance contract and bad faith refusal to pay an\r\ninsurance contract. Colony counterclaimed asking the court to enter a declaratory\r\njudgment stating it owed no duty to BMW under the policy with regard to the\r\nVehicles.\r\n\r\nAfter some written discovery, BMW served notice of a deposition on Colony's\r\nclaims adjuster who dealt with the Vehicles. As a result, Colony filed a motion for\r\na protective order against deposing the adjuster and BMW filed a motion to\r\ncompel. Colony also filed a motion for summary judgment. At the motion\r\nhearing, Colony argued BMW's coverage under the Policy was limited to third-\r\nparty liability coverage. Thus, because CARS, not BMW, was liable for the\r\ndamage to the cars arising out of CARS's negligence, Colony owed no duty to\r\nBMW under the Policy. BMW responded that because they were listed as an\r\nadditional insured in the Policy and the Policy included comprehensive coverage,\r\nColony owed BMW a duty as to the Vehicles. BMW further argued the Policy\r\nwas at least ambiguous in what coverage the Policy afforded them; therefore, it\r\nshould have been interpreted in favor of coverage. Further, BMW argued an\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1On February 24, 2010, a jury verdict was rendered and judgment was entered\r\nagainst CARS in the amount of $216,000 in actual damages resulting from CARS's\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\n                                                                \r\n \r\n\ninterpretation that BMW was only afforded liability coverage under the Policy\r\nwould render it meaningless as to BMW. BMW explained third-party coverage\r\nwould be meaningless to them because CARS's employees never interacted with\r\nthird-parties to whom BMW could become liable. BMW finally argued, even\r\nwithout a breach of the Policy, Colony could still be liable for a bad faith claim.\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted Colony's motion for summary judgment and as a result\r\nfound the motions to compel and for a protective order moot. Specifically, the\r\ntrial court found, based on the Policy's language, BMW was only afforded liability\r\ncoverage. Further, the trial court found BMW presented no evidence BMW was\r\nliable to a third party for the damage to the Vehicles which could trigger its\r\nliability coverage. Additionally, the trial court ruled because BMW was not\r\nafforded coverage under the Policy as to the Vehicles, there was no breach of the\r\nPolicy, nor did BMW have a bad faith claim against Colony. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court\r\napplies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP:\r\nsummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Miller v.\r\nBlumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 219, 616 S.E.2d 722, 729 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\"In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\ninferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Id. \"If triable issues exist, those issues\r\nmust go to the jury.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nCoverage\r\n\r\nBMW argues the trial court erred in finding the Policy did not provide BMW\r\ncoverage. Specifically, BMW contends the Policy shows CARS was paying\r\npremiums for \"Comprehensive\" coverage under the \"Garage Keepers\" coverage,\r\nwhich is separate and distinct from any liability premiums CARS paid, and BMW\r\nwas an additional insured to that coverage. BMW further asserts the Policy is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                \r\n \r\n\nambiguous as to the \"Comprehensive\" coverage, and the ambiguity must be\r\nresolved in favor of coverage. We disagree.2\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to\r\nthe parties' intentions as determined by the contract language.\" Schulmeyer v. State\r\nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003). Where the\r\nlanguage of a contract is clear and unambiguous, it alone determines the contract's\r\nforce and effect. Id. \"This [c]ourt must give policy language its plain, ordinary,\r\nand popular meaning.\" B.L.G. Enters., Inc. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529,\r\n535, 514 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1999). \"Parties to a contract have the right to construct\r\ntheir own contract without interference from courts to rewrite or torture the\r\nmeaning of the policy to extend coverage.\" Schulmeyer, 353 S.C. at 495, 579\r\nS.E.2d at 134.\r\n\r\nColony argues that although BMW is listed as an \"additional insured\" in the\r\nPolicy, the Policy provides only \"Liability\" and \"Garage Keepers\" coverage to\r\nBMW. Thus, because liability coverage extends to cover an insured's liability to a\r\nthird party and BMW has not been found liable to a third party, Colony argues the\r\nPolicy provides no coverage for BMW.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in determining BMW was not afforded coverage\r\nunder the Policy as to the Vehicles. BMW is not a named insured on the Policy\r\nitself. As a result, the Policy as a whole does not initially cover BMW as an\r\ninsured. However, BMW is added to the Policy by way of an endorsement to the\r\nPolicy. This endorsement, however, which is the only way BMW under the policy\r\ncould be an insured, provides only liability coverage. Importantly, the\r\nendorsement makes no mention of comprehensive coverage. Additionally, the\r\nendorsement specifically provides, \"The provisions of the Coverage Form apply\r\nunless modified by the endorsement.\" Thus, because \"WHO IS AN INSURED\" as\r\nto the comprehensive coverage was not modified by the endorsement, the original\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n2 Initially, Colony asserts this issue is not preserved for review. We disagree. At\r\nthe summary judgment hearing, BMW argued the Policy afforded them\r\ncomprehensive coverage. Additionally, the trial court found, according to its plain\r\nlanguage, the Policy only included liability coverage. Therefore, this issue was\r\nproperly raised to and ruled upon by the trial court. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\nS.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first\r\ntime on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial [court] to\r\nbe preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\n                                                                \r\n \r\n\nform applies, meaning only CARS, the named insured, is entitled to that coverage.\r\nTherefore, according to the plain language of the Policy, BMW is only an insured\r\nas to liability.\r\n\r\nBecause BMW is only an insured as to liability coverage under the Policy, for\r\nColony's duty to pay BMW as an insured to be triggered, BMW must have first\r\nbeen liable to some third party. See Trancik v. USAA Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 549, 554,\r\n581 S.E.2d 858, 861 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating liability insurance contracts are\r\ngenerally contracts \"whereby the insurer . . . agrees to pay the insured . . . the\r\namount of any damages the insured may become legally liable to pay to a third\r\nparty\"); see also Black's Law Dictionary 997 (9th ed. 2009) (defining liability as\r\n\"[t]he quality or state of being legally obligated or accountable; legal responsibility\r\nto another\"). BMW failed to present any evidence tending to show it was in any\r\nway liable to a third party due to the damage caused to the Vehicles. Further, in\r\nBMW's response to Colony's request for admissions, BMW admitted no one had\r\nfiled suit against it regarding damage to the Vehicles. Accordingly, the trial court\r\ndid not err in determining the Policy did not afford BMW coverage with respect to\r\nthe Vehicles.\r\n\r\nBad Faith\r\n\r\nBMW argues the trial court erred in granting Colony's summary judgment motion\r\nas to its bad faith claim. Specifically, BMW asserts it was an additional insured\r\nunder the Policy and by ignoring BMW's correspondence, refusing to provide\r\nexplanations as to the denial of coverage, and refusing to acknowledge CARS's\r\nliability, Colony acted in bad faith in processing and denying BMW's claim. We\r\ndisagree.3                   The elements of a cause of action for bad faith refusal to\r\n                             pay first party benefits under a contract of insurance are:\r\n                             (1) the existence of a mutually binding contract of\r\n                             insurance between the plaintiff and the defendant; (2)\r\n                             refusal by the insurer to pay benefits due under the\r\n                             contract; (3) resulting from the insurer's bad faith or\r\n                             unreasonable action in breach of an implied covenant of\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n3 Colony argues this issue is not preserved for review because it was never ruled on\r\nby the trial court. We disagree. In its order, the trial court ruled Colony did not act\r\nin bad faith in denying BMW's claim.\r\n\r\n                                                                \r\n \r\n\n             good faith and fair dealing arising on the contract; (4)\r\n             causing damage to the insured.\r\n\r\nCrossley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 354, 359, 415 S.E.2d 393,\r\n396-97 (1992). \"[A]n insurer acts in bad faith when there is no reasonable basis to\r\nsupport the insurer's decision [for contesting a claim].\" Helena Chem. Co. v.\r\nAllianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 645, 594 S.E.2d 455, 462 (2004).\r\nHowever, where an insurer has a reasonable ground for contesting a claim, there is\r\nno bad faith. Id. Additionally, this good faith obligation includes an insurer's duty\r\nto investigate a claim. Flynn v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 281 S.C. 391, 395, 315\r\nS.E.2d 817, 820 (Ct. App. 1984). Importantly, an insured need not prove a breach\r\nof an express contractual provision as a prerequisite to bringing a bad faith cause\r\nof action. Tadlock Painting Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 322 S.C. 498, 504, 473\r\nS.E.2d 52, 55 (1996).\r\n\r\nColony contends that because no coverage existed as to the claim BMW made,\r\nColony could not have acted in bad faith in refusing to pay BMW. We agree. As\r\npreviously discussed, with respect to the Vehicles, the Policy did not afford BMW\r\ncoverage for this claim. The Fourth Circuit, in Myrick v. Prime Ins. Syndicate,\r\nInc., 395 F.3d 485 (4th Cir. 2005), while interpreting South Carolina insurance\r\nlaw, determined a similar situation to the present case provided reasonable grounds\r\nfor the insurer to deny coverage. In Myrick, the insured sought to insure three\r\npieces of equipment from loss. Id. at 487. Just weeks after the policy became\r\neffective, a fire destroyed one of the pieces of equipment the insured sought to\r\nhave covered under the policy. Id. at 488. After the insured made a claim on the\r\ndestroyed equipment, the insurer correctly determined although the policy at issue\r\ndid provide property coverage for one machine of the type destroyed, it did not\r\nprovide such coverage for the specific machine that burned. Id. at 494. As a\r\nresult, the court held that although the parties admitted a contract existed between\r\nthem, the insurer's refusal to pay benefits was reasonable because the subject\r\nmatter of the claim allegedly triggering payment did not actually fall within\r\ncoverage. Id. at 494-95.\r\n\r\nThe present case bears comparison to Myrick. Just as destruction of the machine in\r\nMyrick could never trigger coverage as to the insured because it was not covered in\r\nthe policy, so too could there never be coverage under the Policy where, as here,\r\nBMW did not face any sort of liability to third parties. As a result, just as was the\r\ncase with the insurer in Myrick, we find Colony had reasonable grounds upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                \r\n \r\n\nwhich to not only contest, but also refuse BMW's claim.4 Accordingly, the trial\r\ncourt did not err in granting Colony summary judgment on BMW's bad faith claim.\r\n\r\nIllusory Policy\r\n\r\nBMW argues an interpretation that the Policy did not provide comprehensive\r\ncoverage renders the Policy meaningless as to BMW. Specifically, BMW asserts\r\nthe Policy would be meaningless because customers do not interact with any\r\nCARS employees; therefore, BMW could never be covered under the Policy if it\r\nonly provided liability coverage. Thus, according to BMW, the possibility for\r\nliability which could be imputed to BMW through CARS is nonexistent. Although\r\nBMW raised the illusory policy issue to the trial court, the trial court never\r\naddressed this issue in its order.5 Additionally, the record is devoid of any\r\nevidence BMW ever filed a Rule 59(e) motion. As a result, this issue is not\r\npreserved for our review. See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733\r\n(holding an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in\r\norder to be preserved for appellate review); see also Elam, 361 S.C. at 24, 602\r\nS.E.2d at 780 (holding a party must file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to preserve\r\nan issue for review that has been raised to but not ruled upon by the trial court).\r\n\r\nMotion to Compel\r\n\r\nBMW argues because the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, it also\r\nerred in finding its motion to compel moot. Based upon our decision to affirm the\r\ntrial court's grant of summary judgment, we need not address this issue. See Futch\r\nv. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n(1999) (holding an appellate court need not address a remaining issue when\r\ndisposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n4 We note the Myrick court also determined the insurer adequately investigated the\r\ninsured's claim. Here, the trial court did not address BMW's allegation of bad faith\r\nin processing BMW's claim in its order. Additionally, BMW failed to raise this\r\nissue in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion. Therefore, BMW's argument regarding\r\nColony's bad faith in processing its claim is not preserved. See Elam v. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (holding a party must file a\r\nRule 59(e), SCRCP motion to preserve an issue for review that has been raised to\r\nbut not ruled upon by the trial court).\r\n5 We note BMW admits in its brief that the trial court failed to address this issue.\r\n\r\n                                                                \r\n \r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                \r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5013","title":"Watson v.

Watson also claims the\r\n\nAppellate Panel erred in granting her employer, XTRA Mile Driver Training, Inc.,\r\nand its insurance company, Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company\r\n(collectively, XTRA), credit for all temporary disability compensation paid after\r\nthe date of maximum medical improvement (MMI). We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 2007, while working as Director of Placement for XTRA,\r\nWatson slipped on a golf ball and fell on her back. Watson was transported to\r\nTuomey Emergency Room where the emergency room physician ordered lumbar\r\nand thoracic spine x-rays, which did not reveal any significant injury. A\r\nsubsequent lumbar MRI of Watson's back revealed, in pertinent part, suspect\r\nhemangiomas, mild disc bulges, and spinal stenosis in Watson's back. The\r\nemergency room physician ordered Watson not to return to work for two days and\r\ninstructed her to see a physician before returning to work.\r\n\r\nOn September 22, 2007, XTRA began paying Watson temporary total disability\r\n(TTD) compensation. Five months later, on February 12, 2008, XTRA and\r\nWatson executed a consent order wherein the parties stipulated to an average\r\nweekly wage of $485.71, with a resulting weekly compensation rate of $323.83.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the emergency room physician's instructions, Watson went to\r\nXTRA's doctor, Dr. John Pate, and saw XTRA's nurse practitioner, Anita Curl.\r\nMs. Curl ordered Watson not to return to work for one week and referred her to\r\nPee Dee Orthopaedics. On October 1, 2008, Watson saw Dr. Rakesh Chokshi, an\r\northopaedic surgeon at Pee Dee Orthopaedics. Dr. Chokshi ordered epidural\r\nsteroid injections, which did not significantly improve Watson's condition.\r\nUltimately, Dr. Chokshi performed lumbar decompression surgery at Watson's L3-\r\n4 and L4-5 discs on March 31, 2009.\r\n\r\nDr. Chokshi then referred Watson to Tuomey Outpatient Rehabilitation Service for\r\nan FCE to establish her permanent work restrictions. The manager of outpatient\r\nrehabilitation at Tuomey Healthcare System, Jerry Shadbolt, performed the FCE\r\non July 6, 2009. Shadbolt testified that during the FCE, he conducted a series of\r\ntests to measure Watson's ability to perform physical activities, such as sitting,\r\nwalking, and standing.1 Based on Watson's ability to perform physical activities,\r\n                                                            \r\n1 The results of the tests revealed, in pertinent part: (1) Watson has a maximum\r\nlifting capacity of ten pounds, placing her into the light category for lifting\r\ncapacity; and (2) Watson has a maximum carrying capacity of ten pounds, placing\r\n\nShadbolt identified Watson's physical restrictions.2 Shadbolt testified he entered\r\nWatson's physical restrictions and Watson's job title3 into a computer, which\r\nutilized a software program to generate a report on Watson's strength and ability to\r\nreturn to work based on the DOT4 guidelines. This report was listed in the strength\r\ncategory of the FCE and concluded:\r\n\r\n                             The Dictionary of Occupational Titles places Ms.\r\n                             Watson's occupation as a Director of Placement in the\r\n                             sedentary strength category. Therefore, Ms. Watson\r\n                             meets these strength requirements and may return to\r\n                             work as Director of Placement.\r\n\r\n                             Based on the strength classifications as established by the\r\n                             Dictionary of Occupational Titles, Ms. Watson is capable\r\n                             of assuming a position in the light strength category. Her\r\n                             maximum lifting capacity is 10 pounds, and her\r\n                             maximum carrying capacity is 10 pounds. According to\r\n                             the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, the light strength\r\n                             category is defined as having the ability to lift 10 [to] 20\r\n                             pounds and carry 5 to 10 pounds.\r\n\r\nShadbolt testified that his opinion as to whether Watson could return to work was\r\nnot contained in the strength category of the FCE report. Shadbolt noted he is only\r\nan expert in conducting the tests to see how long Watson can perform physical\r\ntasks, and the computer generates the report based on the results of those tests.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nher in the light category for carrying capacity as defined by the Dictionary of\r\nOccupational Titles (DOT).\r\n2  Watson's job factor restrictions included: (1) no continuous standing for more\r\nthan twelve minutes; (2) no continuous sitting for more than three minutes; (3) no\r\ncontinuous walking for more than 0.1 miles; (4) no pushing more than twenty\r\npounds; (5) no pulling more than twenty pounds; (6) no stopping; and (7) no\r\ncrawling on her hands and feet.\r\n3  Watson selected her job title, Director of Placement, in the Dictionary of\r\nOccupational Titles, which established the strength category necessary to perform\r\nthat occupation.  \r\n4  The DOT is a U.S. government publication that provides a description of\r\noccupational titles for most jobs in the United States and establishes a strength\r\nclassification for each of these occupations. These strength classifications are\r\nsedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy.  \r\n\nHowever, Shadbolt testified he believed the strength category report's conclusion\r\nthat Watson could return to light strength work was consistent with Watson's\r\nphysical restrictions contained in the FCE.\r\n\r\nXTRA sent Watson a letter instructing her to return to work on Monday,\r\nSeptember 28, 2009. Watson returned to work accompanied by her restrictions as\r\nlisted in the FCE. Upon reviewing those restrictions, XTRA declined to offer her\r\nany work within the restrictions and sent her home.\r\n\r\nAt Watson's request, J. Adger Brown, a vocational analyst, reviewed Watson's\r\nFCE. Brown found the job factor restrictions provided by the FCE left Watson\r\ntotally and permanently disabled and incapable of even sedentary employment.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2009, XTRA filed a Form 21 claiming Watson reached MMI on\r\nAugust 12, 2009.5 Watson filed a Form 50, and XTRA timely responded by filing\r\na Form 51.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Watson alleged she was\r\npermanently and totally disabled and requested a lump sum payment of total\r\ndisability benefits and lifetime causally-related medical treatment. XTRA claimed\r\ncredit for overpayment of TTD paid after August 12, 2009, and sought a final\r\ndetermination concerning Watson's entitlement to future benefits.\r\n\r\nAlthough Watson admitted the FCE into evidence before the single commissioner,\r\nshe objected to the strength portion of the FCE generated by the computer, which\r\nused the DOT guidelines to conclude Watson was capable of assuming an\r\nemployment position in the light strength category. The single commissioner\r\noverruled Watson's objection.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the record as a whole, including Watson's testimony, the FCE,\r\nmedical reports, the consent order, the depositions of Dr. Chokshi and Shadbolt,\r\nand the vocational assessment by Brown, the single commissioner found, in\r\npertinent part: (1) Watson sustained an injury to her back as a result of the work-\r\nrelated accident; (2) XTRA provided Watson adequate medical care; (3) Watson\r\n                                                            \r\n5 XTRA previously filed a Form 21 on September 2, 2009, and September 15,\r\n2009, but filed an amended Form 21, which began the current action, on November\r\n9, 2009.  \r\n\nreached MMI for injuries causally related to the accident by August 12, 2009; (4)\r\nWatson was not permanently and totally disabled; and (5) Watson sustained a 50%\r\npermanent partial disability to her back pursuant to section 42-9-30(21) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these findings, the single commissioner ordered: (1) XTRA\r\nwas responsible for all causally-related medical treatment that was incurred on or\r\nbefore August 12, 2009; (2) Watson was entitled to future Dodge6 medical\r\ntreatment as needed to lessen Watson's causally-related disability from the\r\nSeptember 18, 2007 accident; (3) XTRA's stop payment application was granted,\r\nand XTRA was entitled to stop payment of TTD effective August 12, 2009; (4)\r\nXTRA had no liability for any further TTD; and (5) XTRA must pay a lump sum\r\npayment to Watson representing compensation for 50% permanent loss of use to\r\nthe back, while XTRA was allowed to take credit for all TTD paid to Watson for\r\nthe period after August 12, 2009.\r\n\r\nWatson appealed the single commissioner's order. The Appellate Panel affirmed\r\nthe single commissioner in full, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the substantial\r\nevidence standard for judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 1-23-380 (Supp. 2011); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35,\r\n276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the substantial evidence standard of review,\r\nthis court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the\r\nweight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse when the decision is\r\naffected by an error of law. Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600\r\nS.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is\r\nevidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\nto reach the conclusions the [Appellate Panel] reached in order to justify its\r\nactions.\" Broughton v. S. of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 495, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637\r\n(Ct. App. 1999) (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n6Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 579-80, 514 S.E.2d 593,\r\n596 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding a finding that claimant has reached MMI does not\r\npreclude an award of additional medical benefits for purposes of lessening the\r\nperiod of disability).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    The FCE\r\n\r\nWatson argues the Appellate Panel erred in admitting the strength category\r\ncontained in the FCE that indicates Watson was capable of light strength work.\r\nWatson asserts the vocational opinion was generated by a computer system, and\r\nXTRA offered no evidence to establish the computer was qualified as a vocational\r\nexpert to give an opinion under Rule 702 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nBecause the South Carolina Rules of Evidence do not apply in proceedings before\r\nthe Workers' Compensation Commission, and Watson offers no other authority for\r\nthis court to reverse the Appellate Panel, we affirm the decision to admit the FCE\r\ninto evidence. See Hamilton v. Bob Bennett Ford, 339 S.C. 68, 70, 528 S.E.2d\r\n667, 668 (2000) (\"[T]he South Carolina Rules of Evidence do not apply in\r\nproceedings before the Workers' Compensation Commission.\"); Hallums v.\r\nMicheline Tire Corp, 308 S.C. 498, 504, 419 S.E.2d 235, 239 (1992) (holding the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission is allowed wide latitude of procedure and is\r\nnot restricted to the strict rule of evidence adhered to in a judicial court); see also\r\nConran v. Joe Jenkins Realty, Inc., 263 S.C. 332, 334, 210 S.E.2d 309, 310 (1974)\r\n(holding appellant has the burden of proof to convince a reviewing court that the\r\nlower court was in error, and to do this, appellant must place in the record a\r\nsufficient foundation for his or her argument).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the Appellate Panel's decision to admit the strength\r\ncategory portion of the FCE into evidence.\r\n\r\nII.   Permanent and Total Disability\r\n\r\nWatson argues the Appellate Panel erred in failing to find permanent and total\r\ndisability (PTD) under section 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011)\r\nor, in the alternative, section 42-9-30(21) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nA.    Section 42-9-10\r\n\r\nFirst, Watson contends the Appellate Panel erred in failing to find PTD under\r\nsection 42-9-10. We disagree.\r\n\nSection 42-9-10 provides for PTD \"when the incapacity for work resulting from an\r\ninjury is total.\" The extent of disability is a question of fact to be proved as any\r\nother fact is proved. Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 384, 335 S.E.2d 91,\r\n95 (Ct. App. 1985). In Wynn v. Peoples Natural Gas Co. of S.C., 238 S.C. 1, 11-\r\n12, 118 S.E.2d 812, 817-18 (1961), our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n             Disability in compensation cases is to be measured by\r\n             loss of earning capacity. Total disability does not require\r\n             complete helplessness. . . . The generally accepted test of\r\n             total disability is inability to perform services other than\r\n             those that are \"so limited in quality, dependability, or\r\n             quantity that a reasonably stable market for them does\r\n             not exist.\"\r\n\r\n(internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nHere, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Appellate Panel's\r\nconclusion that Watson is not permanently and totally disabled. At the hearing\r\nbefore the single commissioner, Watson testified as to her education and work\r\nexperience: (1) she graduated high school and attended several training courses in\r\nhealth and life insurance, as well as vocational training in secretarial duties; (2) she\r\nis versed in the operation of computers; (3) she has experience in contract\r\nnegotiation, customer service, accounting, ad design, and other types of secretarial\r\nwork; and (4) she has extensive experience and training in occupations of a\r\nsedentary nature. As to her physical capabilities, Watson testified: (1) she is able\r\nto drive continually for thirty to thirty-five minutes and can drive longer if she\r\ntakes breaks; (2) she performs some household chores; (3) she goes grocery\r\nshopping; (4) she handles all her money and pays her bills; and (5) she no longer\r\ntakes any anti-inflammatories or pain medication.\r\n\r\nFurther, both Dr. Chokshi and Shadbolt evaluated Watson and testified she could\r\nreturn to work in an occupation that complied with her job factor restrictions.\r\nWhile the dissent points out Watson's restrictions, we find Watson's testimony\r\ndescribing her capabilities, and the testimony of Dr. Chokshi and Shadbolt provide\r\nsubstantial evidence to conclude Watson is not permanently and totally disabled.\r\n\r\nBased on the record as a whole, we find Watson failed to show that she was unable\r\nto perform services other than those that are so limited in quality, dependability, or\r\nquantity that a reasonably stable market for them does not exist. See Coleman v.\r\n\nQuality Concrete Prods., Inc., 245 S.C. 625, 630, 142 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1965)\r\n(holding the burden is on the employee to prove he or she is totally disabled,\r\nspecifically that he or she is unable to perform services other than those that are so\r\nlimited in quality, dependability, or quantity that a reasonably stable market for\r\nthem does not exist). Therefore, we affirm the Appellate Panel's conclusion that\r\nWatson was not permanently and totally disabled under section 42-9-10.\r\n\r\nB.     Section 42-9-30(21)\r\n\r\nWatson also contends the Appellate Panel erred in failing to find PTD under\r\nsection 42-9-30(21). We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhile PTD is generally based on loss of earning capacity, section 42-9-30(21)\r\nstates there is a rebuttable presumption of PTD when a claimant has 50% or more\r\nloss of use of the back. Therefore, a claimant with 50% or more loss of use of the\r\nback is not required to prove loss of earning capacity to establish PTD. Bateman v.\r\nTown & Country Furniture Co., 287 S.C. 158, 160, 336 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App.\r\n1985) (holding a claimant who suffers a 50% or more loss of use of the back need\r\nnot show a loss of earning capacity to recover PTD).\r\n\r\nHere, the Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner's finding that Watson\r\nsustained 50% impairment to the use of her back. The Appellate Panel also agreed\r\nthat while there was a presumption Watson was totally and permanently disabled\r\nunder section 42-9-30(21), XTRA rebutted that presumption. We find there is\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the Appellate Panel's conclusion that\r\nXTRA rebutted the presumption that Watson was permanently and totally disabled.\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel relied, in part, on the FCE, which concluded Watson is\r\ncapable of assuming a position in the light strength category. The Appellate Panel\r\nalso reviewed the testimony of Dr. Chokshi who stated, \"As long as the work is\r\nwithin the particular restrictions, I believe it is reasonable for her to continue\r\nworking.\" Dr. Chokshi also determined that according to the American Medical\r\nAssociation (AMA) guidelines, Watson had a 10% impairment rating of the whole\r\nperson. Shadbolt testified he believes Watson could perform a sedentary job if she\r\nwas able to stand up and sit down periodically. Further, Watson testified she is\r\nwilling to work within her strength restrictions, but admitted she has not looked for\r\nany employment within those restrictions.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the testimony of Brown, the vocational analyst, who asserted the\r\nconclusions of the FCE were inconsistent, and Watson was permanently and totally\r\n\ndisabled. However, the Appellate Panel is reserved the task of weighing the\r\nevidence, and it ultimately concluded Watson was not permanently and totally\r\ndisabled. See Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442\r\n(2000) (holding the appellate panel is specifically reserved the task of assessing the\r\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded evidence). We find the\r\nAppellate Panel's conclusion that Watson is not permanently and totally disabled is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record. Accordingly, we affirm the\r\nAppellate Panel.\r\n\r\nIII. Credit for TTD\r\n\r\nWatson argues the Appellate Panel erred in granting XTRA credit for all TTD paid\r\nafter Watson reached MMI on August 12, 2009. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe find substantial evidence in the record to support Watson reached MMI;\r\ntherefore, we hold XTRA is entitled to recover any payment it made to Watson for\r\nTTD after that date. Dr. Chokshi found Watson reached MMI on August 12, 2009.\r\nOn appeal, Watson does not object to Dr. Chokshi's finding of MMI, but instead\r\nargues equity demands that XTRA not receive credit for payments it made to\r\nWatson after she had reached MMI. Because equity follows the law, XTRA is\r\nentitled to credit for any TTD compensation payments it made to Watson after the\r\ndate of MMI. See Curiel v. Envtl. Mgmt. Servs. (MS), 376 S.C. 23, 29, 655 S.E.2d\r\n482, 485 (2007) (\"[T]he date of maximum medical improvement signals the end of\r\nentitlement to temporary total disability benefits.\"); Smith v. S.C. Dep't of Mental\r\nHealth, 335 S.C. 396, 398-401, 517 S.E.2d 694, 695-97 (1999) (finding employer\r\nwas entitled to stop payment of temporary total disability benefits upon a showing\r\nthat the claimant has reached maximum medical improvement); Regions Bank v.\r\nWingard Props., Inc., 394 S.C. 241, 254, 715 S.E.2d 348, 355 (Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(holding a court may not ignore statutes, rules, and other precedent when providing\r\nan equitable remedy).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs in part, and dissents in part.\r\n\nGEATHERS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part. I concur with the majority's\r\nholdings that: (1) Watson's strength assessment was properly admitted into\r\nevidence, and (2) the employer is entitled to a credit for payment of temporary\r\ndisability benefits made after Watson reached maximum medical improvement. I\r\nrespectfully dissent, however, from the majority's holding that Watson is not\r\npermanently and totally disabled, pursuant to sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-30(21) of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, there are two models of workers' compensation; the first, an\r\neconomic model, compensates workers for reductions in earning capacity, while\r\nthe second is based on the degree of medical impairment:\r\n            \"South Carolina's workers' compensation law represents\r\n            a combination of two competing models of workers'\r\n            compensation, one economic and the other medical.\"\r\n            Stephenson v. Rice Servs., Inc., 323 S.C. 113, 116, 473\r\n            S.E.2d 699, 700 (1996). Under the more traditional\r\n            economic theory, the goal of worker's [sic] compensation\r\n            law is to compensate workers for reductions in their\r\n            earning capacity caused by work-related injuries. Id.\r\n            This is the criterion for compensation under the Workers'\r\n            Compensation Act. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-120\r\n            (1985) (\"The term 'disability' means incapacity because\r\n            of injury to earn the wages which the employee was\r\n            receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other\r\n            employment.\").\r\n\r\n            \"Notwithstanding the definition of disability in section\r\n            42-1-120, South Carolina's workers' compensation law\r\n            also recognizes a competing concept of disability that is\r\n            tied to medical impairment rather than to wage loss or to\r\n            any reduction in earning capacity. The schedule[d]\r\n            injuries, which typically provide for fixed awards of\r\n            workers' compensation based on degrees of medical\r\n            impairment to certain listed body parts, are compensable\r\n            without regard to whether the employee is able to\r\n            continue working at the same job. In other words, with\r\n            schedule[d] injuries, the fact the employee still is able to\r\n\n            work constitutes no bar to compensation.\" Stephenson,\r\n            323 S.C. at 117, 473 S.E.2d at 701 (emphasis added).\r\n            Under the medical theory, the focus is on the medical\r\n            impairment of the employee. Id.\r\n\r\nSimmons v. City of Charleston, 349 S.C. 64, 73-74, 562 S.E.2d 476, 480-81 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002).\r\n\r\nWhile an award under general disability requires proof of a loss in earning\r\ncapacity, an award under a scheduled loss does not require such proof:\r\n\r\n            Under our Worker's Compensation Act, a claimant may\r\n            proceed under § 42-9-10 or section 42-9-20 to prove a\r\n            general disability; alternatively, he or she may proceed\r\n            under § 42-9-30 to prove a loss, or loss of use of, a\r\n            member, organ, or part of the body for which specific\r\n            awards are listed in the statute. It is well-settled that an\r\n            award under the general disability statutes must be\r\n            predicated upon a showing of a loss of earning capacity,\r\n            whereas an award under the scheduled loss statute does\r\n            not require such a showing. The commission may award\r\n            compensation to a claimant under the scheduled loss\r\n            statute rather than the general disability statutes so long\r\n            as there is substantial evidence to support such an award.\r\n\r\nFields v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 555, 393 S.E.2d 172, 173\r\n(1990) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). In my opinion, Watson is\r\npermanently and totally disabled pursuant to both statutory models (economic and\r\nmedical).\r\n\r\nThe following facts are undisputed: (1) in a workplace setting, Watson now can sit\r\ncontinuously for no longer than three minutes; (2) in a workplace setting, Watson\r\nnow can stand continuously for no longer than twelve minutes and can walk no\r\nfarther than 0.10 mile; (3) Adger Brown, the vocational analyst who reviewed\r\nWatson's restrictions, found these job factor restrictions rendered Watson\r\npermanently and totally disabled; and (4) when claimant returned to her job, which\r\nis classified as sedentary, her employer sent her home, stating there was no work\r\navailable that could accommodate Watson's job restrictions.\r\n\nAs stated by the majority, the standard for determining total disability under\r\nsection 42-9-10 is the inability to perform services other than those that are so\r\nlimited in quality, dependability, or quantity that a reasonably stable market for\r\nthem does not exist. Wynn v. Peoples Natural Gas Co. of S.C., 238 S.C. 1, 12, 118\r\nS.E.2d 812, 818 (1961). In other words, \"[t]he ability to perform limited tasks for\r\nwhich no stable job market exists does not prevent an employee from proving total\r\ndisability.\" Simmons, 349 S.C. at 74, 562 S.E.2d at 481 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nThe majority reasons that because Watson's strength rating was \"sedentary\" and\r\nbecause her work at the time of injury was also sedentary, Watson remains capable\r\nof returning to sedentary work within the restrictions of sitting no more than three\r\nminutes and standing no more than twelve minutes. However, the very existence\r\nof these restrictions beg the question of whether they so limit the quality,\r\ndependability, or quality of the services Watson is able to perform that there exists\r\nno stable job market for those services. The record includes compelling evidence\r\nthat the sitting and standing restrictions on Watson's work renders her services\r\nunmarketable. When Watson attempted to return to her sedentary job,\r\nunsurprisingly, her employer informed her that it could provide no work within her\r\njob restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe majority points out the fact that Watson had previously worked as a secretary.\r\nHowever, there is no relevant distinction between the nature of Watson's former\r\njob and that of a secretary. Watson's secretarial skills, which also require\r\n\"sedentary\" strength, do not mitigate the impact of the restrictions on her sitting,\r\nstanding, and walking—basic requirements of all sedentary jobs. Contrary to the\r\nmajority viewpoint, I would contend there is no \"reasonably stable\" market for\r\nservices that can be performed by this claimant. In my opinion, Watson cannot\r\nperform workplace services other than those that are \"so limited in quality,\r\ndependability, or quantity that a reasonably stable market for them does not exist.\"\r\nAccordingly, I would hold that Watson is permanently and totally disabled\r\npursuant to section 42-9-10.\r\n\r\nI also disagree with the majority's analysis under the scheduled disability statute,\r\nsection 42-9-30(21). It is particularly significant that section 42-9-30(21) provides\r\na rebuttable presumption of total and permanent disability when a claimant has\r\nexperienced a loss of use of 50% or more of the back. Here, the Commission\r\nfound that, as a result of Watson's workplace accident, Watson had sustained a\r\n50% loss of use to her back, which triggered the presumption that Watson is totally\r\ndisabled. The majority found the employer successfully rebutted this presumption\r\nby relying on Dr. Chokshi's statement that Watson can work within her restrictions\r\n\nand Watson's testimony that she was willing to work within her restrictions. In my\r\nopinion, these statements are not probative of the existence of a stable market for\r\nwork as severely restricted as Watson's work is. See McCollum v. Singer Co., 300\r\nS.C. 103, 107, 386 S.E.2d 471, 474 (Ct. App. 1989) (\"Under Workers'\r\nCompensation Law 'total disability' does not require complete, abject helplessness.\r\nRather it is an inability to perform services other than those that are so limited in\r\nquality, dependability, or quantity that no reasonably stable market exists for\r\nthem.\" (emphasis added)). There is simply no probative evidence in the record to\r\nrebut the presumption of Watson's total disability under section 42-9-30(21). Id.\r\n(rejecting an employer's argument that the claimant's ability to drive a car for an\r\nhour, walk for ten minutes, and go shopping made the claimant employable).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, under each of the workers' compensation models—\r\neconomic and medical—I would reverse the Commission's holding that Watson is\r\nnot totally and permanently disabled.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5014","title":"SCDOR v.

Further, Spinners contends the penalties\r\nimposed by the ALC violated its due process rights. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nSpinners is a private, lakefront resort located on Lake Murray in Saluda County,\r\nSouth Carolina. It consists of two restaurants, a fine dining restaurant that is open\r\nyear round to the public, and an outdoor restaurant that is open from mid-April\r\nuntil the end of summer. From mid-April through Labor Day, Spinners offers live\r\nmusic from its outdoor music stage on Friday and Saturday nights until 10:30 p.m.\r\nOn Sunday afternoons, it offers live acoustic music.\r\n\r\nIn a prior matter before the ALC, Raymond Alford was one of several interveners\r\nprotesting the renewal of Spinners' on-premises beer and wine permit.1 The\r\nDepartment of Revenue (DOR) found while Spinners met the statutory\r\nrequirements for renewal of that permit, protests from the interveners were\r\nsufficient to deny it. Spinners filed a contested case with the ALC, but the parties\r\nresolved the matter by entering into a consent order of dismissal that contained\r\ntwelve stipulations. Stipulation number four provided:\r\n\r\n             Not later than January 1, 2010 Petitioner will install and\r\n             maintain a decibel monitoring device on the corner post\r\n             of the bandstand nearest to Mr. Alford's home. Said\r\n             device will have a red light as part of it that is clearly\r\n             visible from across the cove. Petitioner shall control the\r\n             noise level of all music at all times on the licensed\r\n             premises so that the sound level at said decibel\r\n             monitoring device does not exceed 100 decibels from the\r\n             Petitioner's band stand. The said decibel monitoring\r\n             device shall be posted at or around thirty (30) feet from\r\n             the band stand. The device shall be constructed so as to\r\n             cause the red light to light up at all times if and when the\r\n             decibel level exceeds 100 decibels. Further, the\r\n             Petitioner shall control the noise level of all music at all\r\n             times on the licensed premises so that sound level does\r\n             not exceed 75-80 decibels from Mr. Alford's dock.\r\n\r\n1 Alford lives across the cove from Spinners, and his dock is approximately 150\r\nfeet from Spinners' outdoor music stage.\r\n\nSpinners' license was then renewed by DOR with the inclusion of the agreed-upon\r\nstipulations.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2010, James R. Causey, a field investigator in licensing and\r\nenforcement with the South Carolina Alcohol Beverage Control Commission\r\nreceived a phone call from a \"member of the community\" inquiring about the\r\nstipulations placed on Spinners' license. As a result of that phone call, Causey\r\ncontacted DOR and obtained a copy of the order containing the twelve stipulations.\r\nHe then visited Spinners' property on February 24, 2010, and March 30, 2010,\r\nfinding the business closed on both occasions with no one present on the property.\r\n\r\nCausey returned to Spinners on April 2, 2010, and while it still had not opened for\r\nthe summer season, one of the owners, Theresa LeJohn, was present. Causey\r\ninspected the premises with LeJohn and noted compliance with a number of the\r\nstipulations contained in the consent order of dismissal.\r\n\r\nCausey asked LeJohn about stipulation number four regarding the installation of\r\nthe decibel or light meter. LeJohn informed Causey the decibel meter had been\r\npurchased, but she had not hung the decibel meter on the designated pole yet\r\nbecause Spinners had not opened for business. She explained she would have the\r\nmeter up \"two or three days from now\" before Spinners opened for business. She\r\nfurther showed Causey the pole where the meter was to be placed and told him that\r\nher electrician had already installed wiring to the pole. Causey told LeJohn the\r\nstipulations of the consent order were \"self explanatory,\" and since the meter was\r\n\"supposed to be up January 1,\" he had \"no choice but to issue an administrative\r\ncitation for violation of the stipulation\" pursuant to regulation 7-200.1(I) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code of Regulations (2011).\r\n\r\nAfter his April 2 visit, Causey prepared an administrative report citing Spinners for\r\none violation. Specifically, he cited a violation of the portion of stipulation\r\nnumber four that stated, \"No later than January the 1st, 2010, Petitioner shall install\r\nand maintain a decibel monitoring device on the corner pole of the bandstand\r\nnearest Mr. Alford's home.\" The report provided that the first-time violation\r\nrequired a $500 penalty. Causey did not return to Spinners after his April 2 visit.\r\nDOR issued a determination on August 30, 2010, stating\r\n\r\n             [Spinners] noted that it previously purchased an\r\n             expensive red light decibel monitoring device, but only\r\n\n             mounted the device when live music is being played.\r\n             [Spinners] stated its reasoning for sparingly mounting the\r\n             device is because the device is not all-weather and is not\r\n             under warrantee [sic]. However, [Spinners] stated that\r\n             the device is hung in complete compliance with the\r\n             stipulations during live band performances.\r\n             Unfortunately for [Spinners], the section four of the\r\n             stipulations does not make an exception for [its] actions.\r\n             Thus, [Spinners] has knowingly violated the stipulations.\r\n\r\nThereafter, DOR found that on April 2, 2010, Spinners violated stipulation four of\r\nits license under regulation 7-200.1(I) of the South Carolina Code of Regulations\r\n(2011), which states\r\n\r\n             Stipulations. Any written stipulation and/or agreement\r\n             which is voluntarily entered into by an applicant for a\r\n             permit or license between the applicant and the\r\n             Department, if accepted by the Department, will be\r\n             incorporated into the basic requirements for the\r\n             enjoyment and privilege of obtaining and retaining the\r\n             permit or license and shall have the same effect as any\r\n             and all laws and any and all other regulations pertaining\r\n             to the permit or license. Knowing violation of the terms\r\n             of the stipulation or agreement shall constitute sufficient\r\n             grounds to revoke said license.\r\n\r\nDOR imposed a $500 penalty for what it termed a \"first offense sale for a violation\r\nagainst a Licensee's beer and wine permit.\" Further, it found \"[Spinners] [had] not\r\nprovided sufficient mitigating circumstances to lessen this violation.\" DOR did not\r\nfind any further violations against Spinners.\r\n\r\nSpinners timely filed a request with the ALC for a contested case on the ground\r\nthat stipulation four was ambiguous and unenforceable and needed revision to be\r\nclear and non-contradictory to all parties. The matter was set for a hearing on\r\nNovember 22, 2010. Prior to the hearing, Alford and several other individual\r\nproperty owners across the cove from Spinners moved to intervene in the action\r\nclaiming \"repeated, consistent and blatant violation[s] of the Consent Order\r\nallowing a permit for the premises . . . have adversely and substantially [a]ffected\r\neach intervener and other neighbors to the premises.\" On November 22, 2010, the\r\n\nALC allowed Alford to intervene \"for the limited purpose of presenting evidence\r\nand argument related to the violation and fine assessed by DOR concerning the\r\nplacement and maintenance of a decibel device.\" (emphasis added). The ALC\r\nelaborated on the restrictions to Alford's testimony, noting the additional\r\nviolations, fines, and injunctive relief he sought to be addressed were \"outside the\r\nscope of this contested case.\" The ALC explained \"[w]ith respect to the allegations\r\nof additional violations, the statutory scheme for enforcement of alcohol laws does\r\nnot include a provision allowing a private right to prosecute violations before the\r\nALC\" and \"any action to declare a violation and seek a penalty or license\r\nrevocation must be initiated by [DOR].\" The hearing was then continued until\r\nJanuary 27, 2011.\r\n\r\nSpinners did not appear on January 27, 2011, and the hearing was held in its\r\nabsence.2 DOR informed the ALC it was seeking a $500 fine for this first violation\r\nagainst the license within the three previous years. Alford asked to testify\r\nregarding an alleged seventeen separate incidents with Spinners, the purpose being\r\nto show \"the intent and lack of intent of installing the noise meter.\" When\r\ndiscussing the implications of allowing that testimony, the ALC stated its\r\n\"understanding of the law [was] that only [DOR] has the right to bring a violation.\r\nHowever, [it] believe[d] there may be some flexibility in . . . the penalty for that\r\nfirst violation.\" In allowing the testimony, the ALC further stated that \"while this\r\nis a first violation and [would] be considered only [as] a first violation,\" it had\r\ndiscretion as to what penalty to impose based upon the testimony in the record.\r\nAlford presented evidence pertaining to Spinners' conduct around the time of the\r\nalleged violation. He further testified that he made approximately seventeen\r\ncomplaints to Spinners and local police about noise levels between April and the\r\nend of July 2010. Alford also maintained the first time he saw the decibel meter at\r\nSpinners was mid-August of 2010. He presented photographs depicting his own\r\ndecibel meter on his dock recording noise levels over eighty decibels on eleven\r\ndifferent days between the end of May and mid-July of 2010 and police reports\r\nbased upon his complaints about the noise level.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 2011, Spinners filed a motion to re-open the record on the basis\r\nthat it overlooked the hearing date within the ALC's order granting an intervention\r\nand continuance. Spinners stated, \"Respondent wishes to be heard on the issue of\r\nthe appropriate penalty to be imposed for the alleged violations . . . The respondent\r\n\r\n2The administrative law judge (ALJ) who conducted the hearing on the\r\nmerits was not the same ALJ who granted Alford's motion to intervene.\r\n\nadmits the allegations made by the petitioner but does believe they can offer\r\nevidence in mitigation.\" The ALC granted the motion and a second hearing was\r\nheld on February 17, 2011. All parties appeared at this hearing.\r\n\r\nLeJohn stated Spinners would like to address the mitigation of the fine, as well as\r\nthe interpretation of the particular stipulation Spinners allegedly violated. She then\r\nadmitted to violating the stipulation regarding installing and maintaining a decibel\r\nmeter, \"by virtue of the word, install.\" LeJohn explained that the decibel meter\r\nwas not installed yet at the time of Causey's visit because it was an expensive piece\r\nof equipment, she did not want it exposed to the elements for no reason while\r\nSpinners was not open. At the time of the violation, she testified they had a week\r\nbefore they were supposed to open, and no bands were scheduled to be played until\r\nthat time either.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, LeJohn stated the stipulations were a result of protracted\r\nnegotiations, and that she entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily. While\r\nshe mentioned during negotiations that January 1 was an illogical date for the\r\ndecibel meter installation, she ultimately agreed to it and signed the document.\r\nHowever, she also testified that while the agreement says January 1, Spinners\r\nwould be in compliance with the stipulations if they were completed by the day it\r\nopened. Alford introduced the ALC's order denying reconsideration from the\r\nprevious contested case regarding Spinners' license renewal into evidence. The\r\nmotion for reconsideration requested relief regarding the agreement's stipulations.\r\nThe order stated \"the parties in this matter entered into [the] [c]onsent [o]rder\r\nfreely and willingly. The [c]onsent [o]rder was negotiated among all parties and\r\nwas drafted by the parties before it was submitted to the [c]ourt.\"\r\n\r\nAlford offered scenarios to LeJohn of how the decibel meter could be protected\r\nfrom the elements, and when asked if those would be possible, LeJohn stated, \"I\r\ncould do a number of things, I'm sure.\" Alford continued with a line of\r\nquestioning pertaining to the decibel level at his dock being over 80 decibels.\r\nSpinners objected on the basis that it was not relevant because there was no cited\r\nviolation of the stipulation requiring the sound to be kept at a certain level on\r\nAlford's property. Alford responded that the questioning was in \"mitigation she's\r\ntestified . . . she's fully complied with the consent order,\" and the ALC overruled\r\nthe objection.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 2011, the ALC issued its order finding Spinners violated Regulation\r\n7-200.1(I) and suspended Spinners' on-premises beer and wine permit and private\r\n\nclub liquor by the drink license for sixty days beginning April 15, 2011. In the\r\nALC's findings of fact, it states,\r\n\r\n             [Alford] has a device installed on his dock to allow\r\n             [Spinners] to monitor the sound level to assure\r\n             compliance with [stipulation] 4, which states, '[Spinners]\r\n             shall control the noise level of all music at all time[s] on\r\n             the licensed premises so that sound level does not exceed\r\n             75-80 decibels from . . . Alford's dock.' Between April\r\n             and September, 2010, Alford made telephone calls to\r\n             [Spinners] and the Saluda County Sheriff's Department\r\n             (Sheriff's Department) complaining about loud music on\r\n             17 occasions. Additional complaints were made by other\r\n             neighbors on other occasions. LeJohn admits that neither\r\n             she nor anyone from [Spinners] has ever checked the\r\n             decibel monitor on Alford's dock and that the club has\r\n             never attempted to determine if it has been in compliance\r\n             with the stipulated condition requiring [Spinners] to\r\n             control the noise level of music at all times so that the\r\n             sound does not exceed 80 decibels on . . . Alford's dock.\r\n             [Alford's] Exhibits 1-5 and 7-8 contain photographs\r\n             depicting the monitor on Alford's dock on eleven\r\n             different dates between May 21, 2010 and July 17, 2010\r\n             showing the reading on the device between 82 to 88\r\n             decibels. I find, therefore, that [Spinners] has made no\r\n             attempt to comply with the stipulated condition requiring\r\n             it to control the noise level of music so that the sound\r\n             does not exceed 75-80 decibels at . . . Alford's dock.\r\n             [Spinners] violated the condition limiting the noise level\r\n             as measured from Alford's dock on at least eleven\r\n             separate dates in 2010.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the ALC stated,\r\n\r\n             Stipulation . . . 2 of the Renewal Order requires\r\n             [Spinners] to cease playing all music no later than 10:30\r\n             p.m. The Sheriff's Department Incident reports include\r\n             documentation of complaint calls made by [Alford] at\r\n             10:44 p.m. on June 26, 2010, and 10:34 p.m. on July 16,\r\n\n            2010. I find that [Spinners] has violated [stipulation 2] of\r\n            the Renewal Order on those two occasions.\r\n\r\nThe ALC recognized DOR's recommended penalty for the violation, then stated,\r\n\r\n            Furthermore, because I find that this violation was\r\n            accompanied by other conduct which constitutes ongoing\r\n            knowing violations of other conditions contained in the\r\n            permit and license, I conclude that the appropriate\r\n            penalty in this case is a sixty-day suspension of the beer\r\n            and wine permit and liquor by the drink license.\r\n\r\nSpinners timely moved for a reconsideration and supersedeas on April 5, 2011.\r\nThe ALC denied those motions in orders dated April 11, 2011, and April 12, 2011.\r\nThis appeal followed. Spinners also moved for supersedeas on April 15, 2011,\r\nasking this court to stay the ALC's order suspending its license. That same day,\r\nthis court temporarily granted its motion. On April 28, 2011, this court ordered\r\nan indefinite stay of the ALC's order of suspension.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n   1. Did the ALC err by suspending Spinners' on-premises beer and wine permit\r\n      and private club liquor by the drink license pursuant to section 7-200.1(I) of\r\n      the South Carolina Code of Regulations (2011)?\r\n\r\n   2. Did the ALC err by imposing penalties that violated Sandalwood's due\r\n      process rights?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"Appeals from the ALC are governed by the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA).\" MRI at Belfair, LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 394 S.C.\r\n567, 572, 716 S.E.2d 111, 113 (Ct. App. 2011); see S.C. Code Ann. §§ 1-23-310 to\r\n-400 (2005 & Supp. 2011). \"Pursuant to the APA, this court may reverse or\r\nmodify the ALC if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced because\r\nthe administrative decisions are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\nprovisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon\r\nunlawful procedure; (d) affected by an error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view\r\nof the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f)\r\n\narbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\nunwarranted exercise of discretion.\" MRI at Belfair, 394 S.C. at 572, 716 S.E.2d at\r\n113 (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010)). \"'As to factual issues,\r\njudicial review of administrative agency orders is limited to a determination [of]\r\nwhether the order is supported by substantial evidence.'\" Id. (quoting MRI at\r\nBelfair, LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 379 S.C. 1, 6, 664 S.E.2d\r\n471, 474 (2008)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSubstantial Evidence to Support a Finding of a Willful Violation\r\n\r\nSpinners argues the ALC's finding that it knowingly and willfully violated\r\nRegulation 7-200.1(I) by failing to have a working monitoring device installed by\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 is clearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative, and\r\nsubstantial evidence in the whole record. We disagree.\r\n\r\nLeJohn testified she entered the stipulations freely and voluntarily. However, she\r\nstated that while stipulation four called for the installation of the decibel meter by\r\nno later than January 1, in her mind, if it was installed by the opening of the\r\nsummer band season, Spinners would have been in compliance. We do not agree\r\nwith LeJohn's interpretation of the stipulation. She testified that these stipulations\r\nwere the result of a long negotiation, and that she ultimately signed the agreement,\r\nwhich states installation of the decibel meter must be completed by January 1.\r\nInterpreting the terms of the stipulation as written, LeJohn admitted to violating the\r\nstipulation regarding the installation and maintenance of a decibel meter. Thus, we\r\nfind there is substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the record for the ALC\r\nto find Spinners violated stipulation four. For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the\r\nALC on this issue.\r\n\r\nError in Penalizing Spinners for Other Violations\r\n\r\nSpinners maintains the ALC abused its discretion and committed an error of law by\r\npenalizing Spinners for violations not cited by DOR. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"An administrative agency has only the powers conferred on it by law and must act\r\nwithin the authority created for that purpose.\" SGM-Moonglo, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nRevenue, 378 S.C. 293, 295, 662 S.E.2d 487, 488 (Ct. App. 2008) (citing Bazzle v.\r\nHuff, 319 S.C. 443, 445, 462 S.E.2d 273, 274 (1995)). DOR is charged with the\r\n\nresponsibility of administering and enforcing the laws and regulations governing\r\nthe manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and\r\nalcoholic liquors. S.C. Code Ann. § 61-2-20 (2009) (\"The functions, duties, and\r\npowers set forth in this title are vested in the department and the division. The\r\ndepartment must administer the provisions of this title, and the division must\r\nenforce the provisions of this title.\"). \"Contested case hearings arising under the\r\nprovisions of [Title 61, Alcohol and Alcoholic Beverages] must be heard by the\r\n[ALC] pursuant to the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act and the [APA].\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 61-2-260 (2009).\r\n\r\nDOR has the authority to determine an appropriate administrative penalty, within\r\nthe statutory limits established by the legislature, after the parties have had an\r\nopportunity for a hearing on the issues. See Walker v. S.C. Alcoholic Beverage\r\nControl Comm'n, 305 S.C. 209, 210-11, 407 S.E.2d 633, 634-35 (1991). Further,\r\nin assessing a penalty, DOR \"should give effect to the major purpose of a civil\r\npenalty,\" which is \"deterrence.\" Midlands Util., Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &\r\nEnvtl. Control, 313 S.C. 210, 212, 437 S.E.2d 120, 121 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nDOR can issue monetary penalties pursuant to section 61-4-250 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2009), which states\r\n\r\n             For violations of this chapter, or of Chapter 21 or 33 of\r\n             Title 12, and for a violation of any regulation pertaining\r\n             to beer or wine, the department may, in its discretion,\r\n             impose a monetary penalty upon the holder of a beer or\r\n             wine license in lieu of suspension or revocation.\r\n\r\n             In these cases, the amount of any penalty imposed must\r\n             be determined within the limits prescribed in this section\r\n             in each case by the department after a hearing as\r\n             provided in the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act\r\n             and the [APA]. For these violations:\r\n\r\n             (1) retail beer and wine licensees are subject to a penalty\r\n             of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one\r\n             thousand dollars; and\r\n\n             (2) wholesale beer and wine licensees are subject to a\r\n             penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor more\r\n             than one thousand five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\nRevenue Procedure 04-4, the advisory opinion cited in DOR's final determination,\r\nstates \"[t]he Department recognizes that insuring compliance with the law, not\r\npunishment, is the reason for administrative penalties.\" S.C. Revenue Procedure\r\n04-4 (2004). It must be noted that the revenue procedures do not establish a\r\nbinding norm, and they \"do not restrict [DOR's] authority to impose any sanction\r\nwithin the statutory authority granted by the General Assembly.\" Id. However,\r\naccording to the relevant procedure, a $500 penalty is recommended for a first\r\nviolation of the beer and wine permit. Id.\r\n\r\nIn reaching a decision in a contested violation matter, the ALC serves as the sole\r\nfinder of fact in the de novo contested case proceeding. See, e.g., Marlboro Park\r\nHosp. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 573, 579, 595 S.E.2d 851,\r\n854 (Ct. App. 2004). \"As an administrative agency, [the ALC] is the fact-finder\r\nand it is [the ALC's] prerogative . . . to impose an appropriate penalty based on the\r\nfacts presented.\" Walker v. S.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm'n, 305 S.C.\r\n209, 210, 407 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1991).\r\n\r\nHere, DOR cited Spinners for the sole violation of failure to install and maintain a\r\ndecibel meter on its property on April 2, 2010, in accordance with Spinners' beer\r\nand wine permit, which was a first offense violation. DOR sought a $500 dollar\r\ncivil penalty pursuant to Revenue Procedure 04-4. As stated previously, only DOR\r\nmay bring violations under its regulations, and no private right exists to bring a\r\nclaim against a business under DOR's regulatory scheme. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n61-2-20 (2009). Despite the ALC clearly granting Alford leave to intervene \"for\r\nthe limited purpose of presenting evidence and argument related to the violation\r\nand fine assessed by DOR concerning the placement and maintenance of a decibel\r\ndevice,\"3 Alford was permitted to testify as to other alleged violations at trial. The\r\n\r\n3 We are placed in the rare position of addressing restrictions on an intervenor's\r\ntestimony in an alcohol enforcement matter. The ALC Rules allow \"any person\" to\r\nintervene in \"any pending contested case\" upon a showing that (1) he will be\r\naggrieved or adversely affected by the final order, (2) his interests are not being\r\nadequately represented by existing parties, and (3) the intervention will not unduly\r\n\nALC relied on much of the evidence presented by Alford to find violations\r\nsupplemental to the violation cited by DOR. While the evidence of Spinners'\r\nconduct after the cited violation had some relevance to LeJohn's mitigation\r\nargument, i.e., she intended to install Spinners' meter by mid-April, the ALC\r\nshould have considered the post-citation conduct for the sole purpose of\r\ndetermining the credibility of this mitigation argument.\r\n\r\nIn its findings of fact, the ALC listed at least two other violations that were not\r\ncited by DOR. The ALC's sixty-day suspension of Spinners' beer and wine permit\r\nand liquor by the drink license was specifically based upon not only the one\r\nviolation cited by DOR, but also the additional violations found by the ALC. We\r\nfind the ALC's consideration of post-citation conduct for any purpose other than\r\nthe credibility of Spinners' mitigation argument was an abuse of discretion, while\r\nthe allowance of what amounted to a private citizen bringing a claim under DOR's\r\nregulatory scheme was an error of law. Because this error formed part of the basis\r\nfor a more severe penalty, we reverse the ALC's decision. We remand this case to\r\ndetermine whether the $500 dollar penalty assessed by DOR was appropriate in\r\nrelation to the one violation cited by DOR.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprolong the proceedings or otherwise prejudice the rights of existing parties. ALC\r\nRule 20(B). While intervenors are common in initial licensing matters, a third\r\nparty will typically not be able to establish the second prong of the test, as DOR\r\nwill generally adequately represent private citizens' interests in license enforcement\r\nmatters. However, here, Alford's status as an intervenor is not an issue on appeal.\r\nWe discourage the practice of allowing an intervenor in a license enforcement\r\nmatter, which grants them leave to call witnesses and cross-examine witnesses\r\nbrought by DOR. Permitting that type of action easily opens the door to what has\r\nhappened here, essentially a private citizen bringing a claim against a licensee\r\nunder the DOR license enforcement regulatory scheme. As an alternative, we\r\nbelieve it would be appropriate for the third party to instead be called as a witness\r\nby DOR if necessary.\r\n4 We acknowledge Spinners' due process argument; however, we do not think it is\r\nnecessary to address it in light of our determination of the other issues.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n(1999) (stating that if an appellate court's ruling on a particular issue is dispositive\r\nof an appeal, rulings on remaining issues are unnecessary).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the ALC's decision and remand the matter in\r\naccordance with this decision.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5015","title":"State v.

Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976);\r\n\nand (2) denying Williams' request to charge the jury on defense of habitation. We\r\nreverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn the night of July 9, 2007, Williams was at home with his common-law wife of\r\neighteen years, Valerie Young (Valerie); their two children, Kevin Jr. and Kelsey;\r\nand Valerie's eighteen-year-old son, Rodney. The following relevant testimony\r\nwas elicited at trial regarding the events surrounding that evening.\r\n\r\nValerie testified she and Williams were arguing in their bedroom when their\r\nthirteen-year-old son, Kevin Jr., entered the room and inquired what was going on\r\nbetween them. She told Kevin Jr. everything was fine and to leave. Valerie stated\r\nWilliams then hit her on the leg with a small curtain rod and pulled her hair,\r\ncausing her to scream. At that point, Rodney came into the bedroom to try to stop\r\nthe fight, and Valerie claimed Williams said, \"I knew this day would come.\"\r\nValerie testified Rodney told Williams, \"Dad, my mom deserves to go out and\r\nhave a good time, she don't (sic) deserve that,\" and then Rodney left the room.\r\nWilliams retrieved his shotgun from underneath the bed and pulled some shotgun\r\nshells out of his top dresser drawer. After Williams left the bedroom, Valerie\r\nstated she heard a loud boom and ran outside to find that Williams had shot\r\nRodney in the leg. Rodney died later that evening from the gunshot wound.\r\n\r\nWilliams and Valerie's son, Kevin Jr., also testified. Describing the night in\r\nquestion, Kevin Jr. stated he went to his parents' bedroom because he heard his\r\nmother crying. When Kevin Jr. asked why they were fighting, his parents said\r\neverything was fine. Rodney then came into the room, and he and Williams began\r\nto argue. Kevin Jr. testified that Rodney left the house but that Rodney was\r\ncoming back up the steps onto the porch when Williams shot him. Kevin Jr.\r\nfurther testified that Williams was standing in the doorway of the front door when\r\nhe shot Rodney and that Rodney never tried to reenter the house before Williams\r\nshot him.\r\n\r\nWilliams testified in his own defense at trial. Williams, who had been the lead\r\nsupervisor and shift operator at a chemical plant for twenty years, stated he worked\r\na full shift on the day of the shooting. Williams claimed that on the night in\r\nquestion, he and Valerie were arguing about her failure to clean the master\r\nbedroom despite Valerie being off from work that day. Williams said as they were\r\narguing, Valerie picked up a small curtain rod, but he snatched it from her. He\r\n\nthen proceeded to \"poke\" her with it and hit her on her leg before throwing it on\r\nthe ground. He claimed Valerie started yelling and cursing at him, at which time\r\nKevin Jr. came into the bedroom and asked Williams if everything was all right.\r\nAccording to Williams, after he assured Kevin Jr. everything was okay, Kevin Jr.\r\nleft, and Rodney came into their bedroom. Williams had his back turned away\r\nfrom the door, so Rodney was able to grab Williams behind the neck. Williams\r\nstated Rodney turned Williams around and tried to grab his neck again. Williams\r\ntestified he slapped Rodney's hands down and said, \"I know you're not going to put\r\nyour hands on me,\" to which Rodney responded, \"You're a dead mother f*cker. . . .\r\nYou better get your damn gun.\"\r\n\r\nWilliams stated Rodney then ran out of the bedroom, through the living room, and\r\nout the front door, leaving the front door open behind him. Once Rodney ran out,\r\nWilliams looked through the window blinds and saw headlights outside. Williams\r\nran back to his bedroom, grabbed his shotgun, and ran into the living room where\r\nhe heard Rodney on the porch. Williams stated he told Rodney not to come into\r\nthe house. Williams claimed Rodney's posture was very menacing, and he was\r\ntelling Williams, \"You're going to die tonight.\" Williams stated Rodney had one\r\nhand behind the back of his thigh, and he heard a clicking sound that convinced\r\nhim Rodney was carrying a gun. Williams stated Rodney kept repeating that he\r\nwas going to kill Williams, and because he knew Rodney had a gun behind his\r\nback, he shot him in the leg.\r\n\r\nWilliams left the house in his car but turned himself into police later that evening.\r\nUpon his arrest, he was advised of his Miranda rights and transported to the\r\nsheriff's department. At the sheriff's department, Williams met with Investigator\r\nJohn Kelleher (Investigator Kelleher).\r\n\r\nAt trial, Investigator Kelleher testified he also advised Williams of his Miranda\r\nrights and then asked Williams whether he wanted to talk. Williams responded\r\nthat he did not want to talk. At this point during Investigator Kelleher's testimony,\r\nWilliams objected, arguing the State could not comment on his post-arrest silence.\r\nThe circuit court overruled this objection. Later during trial, the State made two\r\nadditional comments on Williams' post-arrest silence, to which defense counsel\r\nfailed to object.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of evidence, the circuit court charged the jury on murder, the lesser-\r\nincluded offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and self-defense.\r\nThe circuit court also instructed the jury on possession of a weapon during the\r\n\ncommission of a violent crime and on criminal domestic violence of a high and\r\naggravated nature. The circuit court refused Williams' requested charge on defense\r\nof habitation. The jury found Williams guilty of voluntary manslaughter and\r\npossession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. He was\r\nsentenced to eighteen years on the manslaughter conviction to run concurrently\r\nwith a five-year sentence on the weapons conviction. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). This court is bound by the\r\ncircuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Id. This court\r\ndoes not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence but simply determines whether the circuit court's ruling is supported by\r\nany evidence. State v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 473-74, 649 S.E.2d 84, 86 (Ct. App.\r\n2007).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDoyle v. Ohio violation\r\n\r\nWilliams claims the circuit court erred when it allowed the State to comment on\r\nhis post-arrest silence in violation of Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976). We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nIn Doyle v. Ohio, the United States Supreme Court held the due process clause of\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment is violated when the State seeks to impeach a\r\ndefendant's exculpatory story, told for the first time at the trial, by cross-examining\r\nhim about his post-arrest silence after receiving Miranda1 warnings. 426 U.S. at\r\n611. The rationale for Doyle is that it would be a violation of due process to allow\r\nthe State to comment on the silence which Miranda warnings have encouraged.\r\nState v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn addressing why it was error in Doyle for the State to ask the defendant why he\r\ndid not assert his innocence after his arrest by telling police his exculpatory story,\r\nthe Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\n             Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing\r\n             more than the arrestee's exercise of these Miranda rights.\r\n             Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous\r\n             because of what the State is required to advise the person\r\n             arrested. Moreover, while it is true the Miranda\r\n             warnings contain no express assurance that silence will\r\n             carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person\r\n             who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it\r\n             would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due\r\n             process to allow the arrested person's silence to be used\r\n             to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\r\n\r\nDoyle, 426 U.S. at 617-18.\r\n\r\nA review of the record reveals the State improperly highlighted Williams' post-\r\narrest silence on four occasions during trial. Williams objected to the State's first\r\ntwo comments on Williams' post-arrest silence, but failed to object to the State's\r\ntwo subsequent comments. Despite Williams' failure to object to these subsequent\r\ninstances, we review the entire record in determining whether the misconduct is\r\nsufficient to warrant reversal.2 See State v. Arther, 290 S.C. 291, 296, 350 S.E.2d\r\n187, 190 (1986) (holding a Doyle violation \"does not require reversal of a\r\nconviction if a review of the entire record establishes that any error was harmless\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThis court will not reverse Williams' conviction if the comments amounted to\r\nharmless error. For a Doyle violation to be harmless, the record must establish:\r\n\r\n2 We are cognizant of State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551 (1990), in\r\nwhich the supreme court implied the State improperly commented on the\r\ndefendant's post-arrest silence in violation of Doyle. Id. at 258, 391 S.E.2d at 555.\r\nAlthough the supreme court in Myers acknowledged the State repeatedly and\r\nimproperly drew attention to the defendant's right to remain silent, it found defense\r\ncounsel's failure to raise an objection prevented appellate review. Id. at 258-59,\r\n391 S.E.2d at 555. Moreover, it indicated the circuit court's curative instruction\r\nwas sufficient to cure \"these errors,\" but it strongly cautioned solicitors against\r\nviolating the Doyle prohibition and urged such comments to be avoided in the\r\nfuture. Id. at 259, 391 S.E.2d at 555. We find Myers distinguishable from the\r\ninstant case because Williams objected on two separate occasions, and the circuit\r\ncourt failed to issue a curative instruction.\r\n\n             that the reference to silence be a single reference; that the\r\n             single reference never be repeated or alluded to in either\r\n             the trial or in jury argument; that the prosecutor does not\r\n             directly tie the defendant's silence to his exculpatory\r\n             story; that the exculpatory story be totally implausible[]\r\n             [and] transparently frivolous; and that evidence of guilt\r\n             be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nState v. Hill, 360 S.C. 13, 17-18, 598 S.E.2d 732, 734 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal\r\ncitation omitted).\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Williams specifically objects to the State's questioning of Investigator\r\nKelleher, who spoke with Williams the night he was brought to the sheriff's\r\ndepartment. When asked whether he had any conversations with Williams that\r\nnight, Investigator Kelleher responded, \"On that night at the Investigation Office I\r\nadvised him of his Miranda rights. I asked him if he wants to tell me what\r\nhappened and he stated he doesn't want to talk.\" Williams immediately objected,\r\narguing Williams' decision to invoke his right to remain silent was inadmissible.\r\nIn response, the circuit court overruled Williams' objection, stating, \"It creates no\r\ninference of guilt. I mean he can say that he offered him that.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, prior to Investigator Kelleher's testimony, Williams objected to the\r\nState's questioning of Corporal Keith Gregg (Corporal Gregg), who was on call the\r\nevening of the incident. The State asked Corporal Gregg whether he spoke to\r\nWilliams when he was arrested. Corporal Gregg stated he read Williams his\r\nMiranda rights. When questioned about this exchange, Corporal Gregg testified\r\nWilliams understood his rights and was very calm and compliant. Corporal Gregg\r\nstated he told Williams he was being arrested for murder. The State then asked\r\nCorporal Gregg, \"Well did he tell you that he someone (sic) had tried to kill him\r\nthat night?\" Corporal Gregg stated, \"No,\" to which Williams immediately\r\nobjected.\r\n\r\nThe third comment on Williams' post-arrest silence occurred during Williams'\r\ntestimony. The State asked Williams on cross-examination why he never told\r\nInvestigator Kelleher that Rodney pulled a gun on him. The State followed up\r\nsaying, \"Twelve hours later, after you slept on it you told them [Rodney pulled a\r\ngun on you].\" In response, Williams stated, \"No, I didn't answer [Investigator\r\nKelleher's] questions. He read me my rights. I didn't say anything. What he did,\r\n\n[] twelve hours later was serve me another warrant and that's when I spoke to him.\"\r\nThe State proceeded, \"You didn't tell anybody when they tell you you're charged\r\nwith murder, you don't tell anybody, well, he had a gun.\" Williams replied, \"Yes, I\r\ndid. . . . I did tell them,\" to which the State replied, \"After you had some time to\r\nthink about it. That's when you come up with the gun story; isn't that true?\"\r\nDefense counsel did not object to this colloquy between the State and Williams.\r\n\r\nThe last improper comment on Williams' post-arrest silence occurred during\r\nclosing arguments. In the State's attempt to disprove Williams' claim of self-\r\ndefense, the State argued Williams fabricated the story about Rodney being armed\r\nwith a gun. The State posed the question to the jury, \"Or [was] . . . [Rodney being\r\narmed with a gun] another figment of his imagination that [Williams] came up with\r\nduring the twelve hours he waited to talk to law enforcement?\" Williams did not\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nReviewing the entire record, as we must, we find the cumulative effect of the\r\nState's comments to be prejudicial error. See Arther, 290 S.C. at 296, 350 S.E.2d\r\nat 190 (holding a Doyle violation \"does not require reversal of a conviction if a\r\nreview of the entire record establishes that any error was harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt\") (emphasis added). On at least four occasions during trial, the\r\nState highlighted Williams' silence during the first night of his custody, and\r\nWilliams immediately objected to the State's tactics on two of these occasions. We\r\nfind the State's comments to be prejudicial because the State attempted to show\r\nthat if Williams acted in self-defense, he would have immediately explained this to\r\nthe police. See Brown v. State, 375 S.C. 464, 473, 652 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App.\r\n2007) (\"The State cannot, through evidence or the solicitor's argument, comment\r\non the accused's exercise of his right to remain silent.\"). Because the State directly\r\ntied Williams' silence to his claim of self-defense, the error cannot be harmless.\r\nSee Hill, 360 S.C. at 18, 598 S.E.2d at 734 (reversing conviction for violation of\r\ndefendant's due process rights and holding \"[i]n essence, the prosecution attempted\r\nto show had [the defendant] acted in self-defense he would have immediately\r\nexplained this to authorities. Because the State directly tied [the defendant's]\r\nsilence to his defense, the error cannot be harmless\"). Accordingly, we reverse on\r\nthis ground.3\r\n\r\n\r\n3Our decision to reverse on this issue disposes of Williams' remaining argument\r\non appeal. Therefore, we decline to address Williams' remaining argument. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE Williams' conviction and REMAND for a\r\nnew trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination\r\nof a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5018","title":"Dawkins v.

Hewitt, of Bluestein Nichols Thompson &\r\n            Delgado, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In this appeal, Jessie P. Mozie, et al., (Appellants) assert the\r\nspecial referee erred in (1) finding Alfortina Dawkins (Dawkins) was the sole and\r\nexclusive owner of the family property based upon adverse possession; and (2)\r\nrefusing to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground of res judicta. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis case involves a dispute between family members over the ownership of a\r\npiece of property in Fairfield County. The property at issue is a .75 acre tract of\r\nland that is a portion of a larger 3.5 acre tract of land originally owned by Mr. S.T.\r\nPadgett. In 1984, Mr. Padgett executed a deed (the 1984 deed) conveying the 3.5\r\nacre parcel of land to his wife, Dolly Padgett, during her lifetime, and upon her\r\ndeath to Jessie Mozie, one of his daughters.1 When Dolly Padgett died in 1992 she\r\nleft a will that gave the 3.5 acre tract of land and the house on the land to their\r\nother daughter, Dawkins, despite Mr. Padgett's 1984 deed providing the land\r\nwould pass to Jessie Mozie. However, Dolly Padgett's will was never probated.\r\nDawkins moved into the house on the 3.5 acre tract of land in 1992 after her\r\nmother died.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Mr. Padgett brought a lawsuit seeking to set aside the 1984 deed and have\r\nthe deed construed as a constructive trust, asserting that his intention was never to\r\nhave Jessie Mozie own the 3.5 acre tract of land in fee simple, but rather his\r\nintention was for all of his heirs to share the property. Mr. Padgett died during the\r\npendency of the lawsuit, and his five daughters were substituted as plaintiffs in the\r\naction, which ultimately ended with the circuit court declining to impose a\r\nconstructive trust.\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 2005, Dawkins initiated this lawsuit alleging she acquired the\r\nproperty by adverse possession because she moved onto the land in December\r\n1992, and she had been in continuous, hostile, open, actual, notorious, and\r\nexclusive possession since that time. Initially, Jessie Mozie was the only\r\ndefendant, but because Jessie Mozie died, Jessie Mozie's children were substituted\r\nas the defendants. Appellants answered and asserted Dawkins' complaint failed to\r\nstate a cause of action. Appellants also counterclaimed for rent.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court referred the case to a special referee, who heard the case on\r\nOctober 24, 2008. Dawkins originally claimed title to the entire 3.5 acre tract of\r\nland but amended her claim during trial to include only the .75 acre tract. In an\r\norder signed March 18, 2010, the special referee found Dawkins was the sole and\r\nexclusive owner of the .75 acre tract of land through adverse possession.\r\nAppellants filed a motion to reconsider, which the special referee denied. This\r\n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n1Mr. and Mrs. Padgett had five daughters: Dorothy McCants, Bethany Padgett,\r\nPearl Padgett, Alfortina Dawkins, and Jessie Mozie.   \r\n\nappeal follows.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nA claim of ownership based on adverse possession is an action at law. Miller v.\r\nLeaid, 307 S.C. 56, 61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1992). \"In an action at law, the\r\nappellate court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm the special referee's\r\nfactual findings unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports those\r\nfindings.\" Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App.\r\n1997).\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Adverse Possession\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the special referee erred in finding Dawkins proved by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that she possessed the .75 acre tract of land for the requisite\r\nten-year period necessary for adverse possession. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"In order to establish a claim of adverse possession, the claimant must prove by\r\nclear and convincing evidence that possession of the property was continuous,\r\nhostile, actual, open, notorious, and exclusive for the statutory period.\" McDaniel\r\nv. Kendrick, 386 S.C. 437, 442, 688 S.E.2d 852, 855 (Ct. App. 2009). \"In South\r\nCarolina, adverse possession may be established if the elements of the claim are\r\nshown to exist for at least ten years.\" Jones v. Leagan, 384 S.C. 1, 10, 681 S.E.2d\r\n6, 11 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 15-67-210 (Supp. 2008)).\r\n\r\nHere, Appellants only challenge whether Dawkins possessed the property for the\r\nrequired statutory period. Appellants assert Dawkins did not possess the property\r\nadversely for the required ten-year period because she claimed ownership of the\r\nproperty under a constructive trust from 1992 to 1996. This argument is based on\r\nthe lawsuit brought by Mr. Padgett after the death of his wife to set aside the 1984\r\ndeed and impose a constructive trust. During the litigation, Mr. Padgett died, and\r\nDawkins and her sisters were substituted as plaintiffs. However, the circuit court\r\ndeclined to impose a constructive trust.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we find there is evidence to support the special referee's finding that\r\nwhen Dawkins moved onto the .75 acre tract of land in 1992, she was not claiming\r\nownership of the property pursuant to a constructive trust. Dawkins testified she\r\nbelieved she acquired title to the property pursuant to the will left by her mother,\r\n\nDolly Padgett. Dawkins stated she never moved from the property, and she has\r\nlived there continuously since 1992. Dawkins also testified her two children lived\r\nin the home on the property with her from 1992 to 2003. Dawkins asserts she\r\nnever paid rent for her use of the property, and she made various improvements\r\nand repairs to the house on the property since she took possession in 1992.\r\nDawkins maintained she paid taxes on the property from 1992 to 2004.\r\n\r\nFurther, when Mozie brought an eviction action against Dawkins in 1994, Dawkins\r\ntestified she refused to vacate the premises and continued to live on the property\r\nuntil 2005. This evinces Dawkins' possession of the .75 acre tract of land has been\r\nhostile since at least 1994.\r\n\r\nDawkins filed this lawsuit asserting that she owned the property under a claim of\r\nadverse possession in 2005. We hold there is ample evidence in the record to\r\nsupport the special referee's finding Dawkins was in hostile possession of the .75\r\nacre tract of land from at least 1994 to 2005. Because this possession is greater\r\nthan the requisite ten-year period necessary to establish adverse possession, we\r\naffirm the special referee.\r\n\r\nII.   Res Judicata\r\n\r\nAppellants assert that because Dawkins sought title to the .75 acre tract of land in a\r\nprior action, she was barred from bringing an action for adverse possession by res\r\njudicata. We find this issue not preserved for review.\r\n\r\nRes judicata is an affirmative defense that must be pled at trial to be pursued on\r\nappeal. RIM Assocs. v. Blackwell, 359 S.C. 170, 182, 597 S.E.2d 152, 159 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2004). An affirmative defense is waived if not pled. Id.\r\n\r\nAppellants failed to plead this issue in their answer and counterclaim and failed to\r\nraise this issue during the hearing before the special referee. Appellants first raised\r\nthis issue in a post-trial brief; therefore, this issue is not properly preserved. See\r\nJohnson v. Sonoco Prod. Co., 381 S.C. 172, 177, 672 S.E.2d 567, 570 (2009)\r\n(holding an issue may not be raised for the first time in a post-trial motion).\r\n\r\nEven if this issue were properly pled, the special referee never ruled on this issue\r\nin his order filed on March 18, 2010. In their motion for reconsideration,\r\nAppellants failed to request a ruling by the special referee and failed to make a\r\npost-trial motion requesting a ruling. Therefore, because no ruling was ever made\r\non this issue, it is not preserved for appellate review. See Noisette v. Ismail, 304\r\n\nS.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding issue not preserved for appellate\r\nreview where lower court did not rule on the issue, and the party failed to make a\r\n59(e) motion asking the lower court to rule on the issue); Halbersberg v. Berry,\r\n302 S.C. 97, 104, 394 S.E.2d 7, 12 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding an issue not explicitly\r\nruled on by lower court was waived for appellate review where omission was not\r\nbrought to lower court's attention by way of a proper motion); see also Fettler v.\r\nGenter, 396 S.C. 461, 469, 722 S.E.2d 26, 30 (Ct. App. 2012) (holding an\r\nappellate court cannot address an issue unless it was first raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the lower court).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the special referee's rulings are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, J.J., concur.           \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5019","title":"Johnson v.

Lloyd, and the State of South Carolina (collectively, Appellants) argue the\r\ncircuit court erred in finding John Christopher Johnson (Johnson) properly raised a\r\nclaim for equitable relief and could be removed from the South Carolina Sex\r\n\nOffender Registry (the registry). Additionally, Appellants contend the circuit court\r\nerred in concluding they waived their right to assert equitable defenses and erred in\r\nconcluding Appellants failed to prove an equitable defense. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn May 2003, Johnson pled guilty to lewd act on a child under the age of sixteen in\r\nviolation of Section 16-15-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003) (the lewd act\r\nstatute).1 Johnson was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment suspended upon the\r\nservice of one hundred days and two years' probation. Johnson was also required\r\nto register as a sex offender pursuant to section 23-3-430(C)(11) (2007) (the\r\nregistry statute).2 Upon successful completion of his probationary sentence,\r\nJohnson learned the registry was not merely a condition of his probation, but that\r\nhe was required to register as a sex offender for life.\r\n\r\nIn September 2009, Johnson brought a declaratory judgment action, alleging two\r\ncauses of action and seeking to be removed from the registry.3 In his complaint,\r\nJohnson argues the requirement that he register as a sex offender constitutes cruel\r\nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States\r\nConstitution.4 Johnson also challenges the requirement that he register, based on\r\nhis conviction of the lewd act statute, as violating the Equal Protection Clause of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. § 16-15-140 (2003) (\"It is unlawful for a person over the age of\r\nfourteen years to wilfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd or lascivious act\r\nupon or with the body, or its parts, of a child under the age of sixteen years, with\r\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual\r\ndesires of the person or of the child.\").\r\n2 Section 23-3-430(C)(11) (2007) provides, in pertinent part: \"[A] person who has\r\nbeen convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been adjudicated\r\ndelinquent for any of the following offenses shall be referred to as an offender . . .\r\ncommitting or attempting lewd act upon child under sixteen . . . .\"\r\n3 Johnson did not appeal his guilty plea or file a post-conviction relief action.\r\n4 The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution reads: \"Excessive bail\r\nshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\r\npunishments inflicted.\"\r\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.5 Additionally, in his\r\nprayer for relief, Johnson requested the circuit court to \"order [Appellants] to\r\nremove [Johnson's] name from the Sex Offender Registry and for such other and\r\nfurther relief as may be deemed appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nAfter filing responsive pleadings, Appellants moved to dismiss Johnson's\r\ncomplaint. On February 12, 2010, the circuit court entered an order denying\r\nAppellants' motion. Johnson subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment,\r\nwhich was denied by the circuit court on June 1, 2010. A bench trial was held on\r\nFebruary 2, 2011, and the circuit court took the matter under advisement. The\r\ncircuit court issued its order on March 1, 2011, declining to grant Johnson relief on\r\nhis constitutional challenges, but concluding Johnson is entitled to equitable\r\n\"personal relief in his unique circumstance[].\" The circuit court further found that\r\nthe legislative intent behind the registry was to protect the public from sexual\r\noffenders who may re-offend, and the circuit court concluded Johnson did not\r\nsatisfy this criteria. Appellants filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"A declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, and therefore, the\r\nstandard of review is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.\" Auto\r\nOwners Ins. Co. v. Newman, 385 S.C. 187, 191, 684 S.E.2d 541, 543 (2009) (citing\r\nColleton Cnty. Taxpayers Ass'n v. Sch. Dist. of Colleton Cnty., 371 S.C. 224, 231,\r\n638 S.E.2d 685, 688 (2006)). Whether an individual must be placed on the sex\r\noffender registry is a question of law. See generally Noisette v. Ismail, 299 S.C.\r\n243, 247, 384 S.E.2d 310, 312 (Ct. App. 1989) (\"Unless the cause of action and the\r\nrelief sought in a declaratory judgment action are distinctly equitable, the action\r\nwill be considered one at law.\"). When reviewing an action at law, our scope of\r\nreview is limited to the correction of errors of law. S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. Horry\r\nCnty., 391 S.C. 76, 81, 705 S.E.2d 21, 24 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in\r\npertinent part: \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\r\nequal protection of the laws.\"\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.      Equitable Relief\r\n\r\nAppellants assert the circuit court erred in finding Johnson raised a claim for\r\nequitable relief. Specifically, Appellants contend Johnson's complaint only alleges\r\ntwo legal causes of action. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The character of an action is determined by the main purpose of the complaint.\"\r\nJacobs v. Serv. Merch. Co., Inc., 297 S.C. 123, 127, 375 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App.\r\n1988) (internal citation omitted). An action which is essentially one at law is not\r\nconverted into an equitable action because it is brought pursuant to the Uniform\r\nDeclaratory Judgments Act. See Legette v. Smith, 226 S.C. 403, 415, 85 S.E.2d\r\n576, 581 (1955). Moreover, \"[w]hether an individual must be placed on the sex\r\noffender registry is a question of law.\" Lozada v. S. C. Law Enforcement Div., 395\r\nS.C. 509, 512, 719 S.E.2d 258, 259 (2011) (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\nAlthough Johnson alleges two causes of action challenging the constitutionality of\r\nthe registry statute and the lewd act statute, he maintains his declaratory judgment\r\naction raises a claim for equitable relief. However, an appellate court is not bound\r\nby a party's characterization of the actions. Klippel v. Mid-Carolina Oil, Inc., 303\r\nS.C. 127, 129 n.2, 399 S.E.2d 163, 164, n.2 (Ct. App. 1990) (internal citation\r\nomitted) (stating this court is not bound by a stipulation in the Statement of the\r\nCase when the record reflects differently). Notwithstanding Johnson's\r\ncharacterization of his complaint as equitable in nature, he sought a declaration\r\nfrom the circuit court that two statutes were unconstitutional. Specifically,\r\nJohnson asked the circuit court to find the requirement he register as a sex offender\r\nfor life \"impermissibly cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth\r\nAmendment.\" Additionally, Johnson asked the circuit court to declare the registry\r\nrequirement's distinctions between criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the\r\nsecond degree6 and the lewd act statute as \"unconstitutionally violative of his\r\nconstitutional rights.\" Johnson did not assert an additional cause of action seeking\r\nequitable relief. Rather, he is asking the circuit court to declare the relevant\r\nstatutes unconstitutional, which is a question of law. See Harkins v. Greenville\r\nCnty., 340 S.C. 606, 621, 533 S.E.2d 886, 893 (2000) (holding an action for a\r\n\r\n\r\n6   See § 16-3-655(B)(2) (2003).\r\n\ndeclaratory judgment that a zoning ordinance is unconstitutional is an action at\r\nlaw).\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Johnson asserts language in his prayer for relief asking the circuit court\r\nto remove Johnson's name from the registry sufficiently raises an equitable cause\r\nof action. We disagree. Our courts have held that the \"relief to be granted depends\r\nnot upon that asked for in the prayer but it must be such as is warranted by some\r\nallegation contained in the pleadings.\" Mortgage Loan Co. v. Townsend, 156 S.C.\r\n203, 226, 152 S.E. 878, 886 (1930); see also Speizman v. Guill, 202 S.C. 498, 515,\r\n25 S.E.2d 731, 739 (1943) (\"[I]f a complaint clearly states facts constituting only a\r\nlegal cause of action and adds a prayer for equitable relief only . . . the prayer must\r\nyield to the true character of the action as determined by the facts stated in the\r\ncomplaint.\"). Here, Johnson's complaint only asserts two legal causes of action.\r\nAccordingly, we conclude the circuit court erred in finding Johnson properly\r\nasserted a claim for equitable relief.\r\n\r\nII.   Removal\r\n\r\nAppellants also argue the circuit court erred in granting Johnson equitable relief by\r\nremoving him from the registry. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"It is well known that equity follows the law.\" Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 164,\r\n650 S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ct. App. 2007). While equitable relief is generally available\r\nwhen there is no adequate remedy at law, an adequate legal remedy may be\r\nprovided by statute. Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 298\r\nS.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989). When providing an equitable remedy,\r\nthe court may not ignore statutes, rules, and other precedent. Lonchar v. Thomas,\r\n517 U.S. 314, 323 (1996). Indeed, a \"court's equitable powers must yield in the\r\nface of an unambiguously worded statute.\" Santee Cooper, 298 S.C. at 185, 379\r\nS.E.2d at 123.\r\n\r\nHere, the registry statute found in section 23-3-430 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2007) provides several avenues for an individual to be removed from the registry.\r\nSection 23-3-430(E) provides that the\r\n\r\n             [South Carolina Law Enforcement Division] shall\r\n             remove a person's name and any other information\r\n             concerning that person from the sex offender registry\r\n\n             immediately upon notification by the Attorney General\r\n             that the person's adjudication, conviction, guilty plea, or\r\n             plea of nolo contendere for an offense listed in subsection\r\n             (C) was reversed, overturned, or vacated on appeal and a\r\n             final judgment has been rendered.\r\n\r\nIn addition, section 23-3-430(F)(2) of the South Carolina Code (2007) states that\r\nan offender may be removed from the registry if he receives a pardon and \"the\r\npardon is based on a finding of not guilty specifically stated in the pardon.\"\r\nFinally, an offender may be removed from the registry if he receives a new trial\r\nfollowing the discovery of new evidence and \"a verdict of acquittal is returned at\r\nthe new trial or entered with the state's consent.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(G)\r\n(2007).\r\n\r\nThere are several statutory methods in which Johnson can be removed from the\r\nregistry; he simply does not qualify for them. Johnson failed to file an appeal or a\r\npost-conviction relief action, which could entitle him to relief under section 23-3-\r\n430(E). Moreover, Johnson has not been granted a pardon, nor has there been any\r\nnewly-discovered evidence to warrant removing him from the registry. See § 23-3-\r\n430(F)(2) & (G). The General Assembly enacted an unambiguously worded\r\nstatute that sets forth the legal remedies available to an individual on the registry.\r\nBecause the sex offender registry statute provides an adequate remedy for Johnson,\r\nit was error for the circuit court to fashion an equitable remedy in this case.7\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the circuit court's order removing Johnson from the\r\nregistry for his conviction of a lewd act upon a child under sixteen.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 In light of our disposition herein, we decline to address the Appellants' remaining\r\narguments.

We dismiss this appeal as\r\nuntimely, and thus, we do not reach the merits of Rhame's arguments.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nRhame was employed by the Charleston County School District (District) as a\r\nheating and air conditioning technician from 1987 to 2009. His job frequently\r\nrequired him to lift heating and air conditioning equipment. According to Rhame,\r\nsome of this equipment weighed as much as fifty to one-hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nRhame admitted he began experiencing off-and-on back pain in 1994 or 1995.\r\nAdditionally, in 2006, Rhame developed a problem with his neck due to his\r\nemployment, which was diagnosed as a cervical fusion. After speaking with the\r\nDistrict about the neck problem, he was told they would not take care of it. A\r\nfollow-up letter was sent to Rhame from the District confirming their denial of\r\nworkers' compensation benefits for his neck injury. Rhame did not contact anyone\r\nelse concerning the incident.\r\n\r\nRhame initiated this case by filing a Form 50 with the South Carolina Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission (Commission) on September 29, 2009. He alleged that\r\non May 4, 2009, he sustained a back injury from repetitively picking up heavy air\r\nconditioning units. Shortly after filing the Form 50, Rhame amended it to\r\nspecifically \"reflect repetitive trauma for the nature of the injury.\"\r\n\r\nThe District answered by filing a Form 51 on October 7, 2009, in which it denied\r\nRhame had sustained an injury by accident. Additionally, the District asserted\r\nRhame had not complied with the Workers' Compensation Act's (WCA) notice\r\nrequirement and that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The\r\nDistrict contended that in 1994 or 1995, as soon as Rhame knew he was having\r\nback pain caused by his job, Rhame knew or should have known he had a\r\ncompensable injury and brought a claim for benefits. Rhame explained his delay\r\nin filing a workers' compensation claim, stating: (1) his back pain was off-and-on\r\nand was never the result of a single discreet or identifiable injury; (2) he had a fear\r\nof losing his job; (3) his ability to complete his work-related duties was not\r\naffected until 2009; and (4) he was ignorant of the workers' compensation system\r\nand the concept of repetitive trauma injuries until retaining counsel in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner heard the case on December 3, 2009, and issued an order dated\r\nFebruary 24, 2010, and filed February 26, 2010, finding Rhame's claim was not\r\nbarred by the statute of limitations.\r\n\nOn March 1, 2010, District filed a Form 30 requesting the Appellate Panel to\r\nreview the commissioner's decision. Both parties submitted briefs to the Appellate\r\nPanel. The Appellate Panel conducted a hearing on May 17, 2010, and in an order\r\ndated and filed August 6, 2010, it reversed the commissioner's decision. The\r\nAppellate Panel found Rhame was aware of his \"back injury\" in 1994 or 1995, yet\r\nhe did not file a claim within two years of when he knew or should have known\r\nthat his claim was compensable. It also found Rhame \"showed awareness of the\r\nworkers' compensation system\" by trying to file a claim for his 2006 neck injury,\r\nand that he delayed bringing the present claim out of fear of losing his job.\r\n\r\nRhame filed a petition for rehearing on September 8, 2010. The District opposed\r\nthe petition, and in an order dated September 20, 2010, and filed September 21,\r\n2010, the Appellate Panel dismissed the petition. On October 21, 2010, Rhame\r\nserved and filed notice of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the substantial\r\nevidence standard for judicial review of decisions by the [Appellate Panel].\"\r\nMurphy v. Owens Corning, 393 S.C. 77, 81, 710 S.E.2d 454, 456 (Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(citing S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2011)). \"Under the substantial\r\nevidence standard of review, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of\r\nthe [Appellate Panel] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\nreverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.\" Id. at 81-82, 710 S.E.2d\r\nat 456 (citing Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552\r\n(Ct. App. 2004)).\r\n\r\n\"'Statutory interpretation is a question of law.'\" Id. at 82, 710 S.E.2d at 456\r\n(quoting Hopper v. Terry Hunt Constr., 373 S.C. 475, 479, 646 S.E.2d 162, 165\r\n(Ct. App. 2007)). \"This court is free to decide matters of law with no particular\r\ndeference to the fact finder.\" Id. (citing Pressley v. REA Constr. Co., 374 S.C. 283,\r\n287-88, 648 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct. App. 2007)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nTolling the Time for Appeal by Filing a Petition for Reconsideration\r\n\r\nAs a threshold matter, District argues there is no statute allowing for a petition for\r\nrehearing to be filed, and an appeal pursuant to section 42-17-60 of the South\r\n\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2011) is the only route to review a decision by the Appellate\r\nPanel; thus, District argues the time period for filing this appeal was not tolled by\r\nRhame filing a petition for rehearing, and this appeal is untimely. We agree.\r\n\r\nRhame argues his right to file a petition for rehearing with the Appellate Panel is\r\nderived from section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011). Section\r\n1-23-380 provides that a party initiates judicial review of an agency's decision by\r\nserving and filing a notice of appeal \"within thirty days after the final decision of\r\nthe agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after the decision is\r\nrendered.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(1) (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). He\r\nadmitted the Commission has no regulation regarding the applicability of petitions\r\nfor rehearing, but relied upon McCummings v. South Carolina Department of\r\nCorrections, 319 S.C. 440, 462 S.E.2d 271 (1995), to support his position that\r\nstatutory silence on an issue does not mean it is disallowed.1\r\n\r\nSection 42-17-50 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) provides the procedure\r\nfor appealing the commissioner's decision. It states:\r\n\r\n             If an application for review is made to the [Appellate\r\n             Panel] within fourteen days from the date when notice of\r\n             the award shall have been given, the [Appellate Panel]\r\n             shall review the award and, if good grounds be shown\r\n             therefor, reconsider the evidence, receive further\r\n             evidence, rehear the parties or their representatives and,\r\n             if proper, amend the award.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-17-50 (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n1 McCummings determined whether statutory silence regarding the time limit for\r\nfiling a petition for rehearing meant a party had infinite time to file it. Id. at 442-\r\n43, 462 S.E.2d at 272-73. Because it involved an employment grievance, we find\r\nMcCummings inapplicable to the case at bar. Workers' compensation appeals are\r\nspecifically governed by the WCA's appellate procedure statute. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n42-17-50 (Supp. 2011); see SGM-Moonglo, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 378 S.C.\r\n293, 295, 662 S.E.2d 487, 488 (Ct. App. 2008) (\"An administrative agency has\r\nonly the powers conferred on it by law and must act within the authority created\r\nfor that purpose.\" (citing Bazzle v. Huff, 319 S.C. 443, 445, 462 S.E.2d 273, 274\r\n(1995))).\r\n\n\"The [Appellate Panel] is the ultimate fact finder in Workers' Compensation cases\r\nand is not bound by the [] [c]ommissioner's findings of fact.\" Muir v. C.R. Bard,\r\nInc., 336 S.C. 266, 281, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591 (Ct.

The\r\nfinal determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is\r\nreserved to the Appellate Panel. Id. at 282, 519 S.E.2d at 591 (citing Ross, 298\r\nS.C. at 492, 381 S.E.2d at 730).\r\n\r\nSection 42-17-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) provides the procedure\r\nfor appealing the Appellate Panel's decision. It states:\r\n\r\n             The award of the [Appellate Panel], as provided in\r\n             Section 42-17-40, if not reviewed in due time, or an\r\n             award of the [Appellate Panel] upon the review, as\r\n             provided in Section 42-17-50, is conclusive and binding\r\n             as to all questions of fact. However, either party to the\r\n             dispute, within thirty days from the date of the award or\r\n             within thirty days after receipt of notice to be sent by\r\n             registered mail of the award, but not after, whichever is\r\n             the longest, may appeal from the decision of the\r\n             [Appellate Panel] to the court of appeals. Notice of\r\n             appeal must state the grounds of the appeal or the alleged\r\n             errors of law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-17-60 (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nFurther, case law specifically states Rule 59(e), SCRCP motions are not applicable\r\nin matters before the Commission itself; such motions are applicable when the\r\ncircuit court sits in an appellate capacity, and they are required to preserve an issue\r\nfor review by the appellate courts. Pikaart v. A & A Taxi, Inc., 393 S.C. 312, 324,\r\n713 S.E.2d 267, 274 (2011) (citing Stone v.

App. 2000) (stating that workers' compensation law\r\ndoes not contain a motion to reconsider the commission's ruling; rather, a party\r\nmust appeal)).\r\n\r\nAs with motions to reconsider, we find petitions for rehearing are not applicable in\r\nmatters before the Appellate Panel. Thus, the petition for rehearing at issue did not\r\ntoll the time to appeal the Appellate Panel's order to this court. On August 6, 2010,\r\nthe Appellate Panel issued their order reversing the commissioner's award. On\r\nOctober 21, 2010, Rhame served and filed his notice to appeal. Rhame served and\r\nfiled his notice of appeal well after the thirty day time period pursuant to section\r\n42-16-70.

Southern Glass contends the trial court\r\nerred in granting summary judgment to Kemper on Southern Glass's action to\r\n\nrecover additional payments, determining the parties entered into an\r\nenforceable contract. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                   FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n      Southern Glass performed twelve automobile glass replacements for\r\ninsureds of Kemper. Southern Glass submitted invoices to Kemper, but\r\nKemper only paid part of the amount requested for each automobile.\r\nSouthern Glass brought an action in magistrate's court against Kemper for\r\nbreach of contract, alleging it was owed $2,301.98. Southern Glass\r\ncontended it had submitted invoices to Kemper for replacing the auto glass in\r\ntwelve vehicles but Kemper had only paid part of the amount submitted for\r\neach vehicle. Kemper filed an amended answer and counterclaim, which\r\ncaused the amount in controversy to exceed $7,500, and the case was\r\ntransferred to the court of common pleas.\r\n\r\n       Kemper filed a motion for summary judgment, contending Southern\r\nGlass was not entitled to full payment because it had billed for more than the\r\nparties agreed to and thus Kemper had not breached the contract. Kemper\r\nattached to its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment\r\nan affidavit from Brad Boardman. Boardman stated, \"I oversee the national\r\nglass program for automobile coverage for Kemper . . . .\" He further stated,\r\n\"Kemper handles automobile glass claims through a third-party\r\nadministrator, Safelite Solutions.\" He also indicated, \"Kemper reviews\r\nindustry data for glass claims several times each year and determines whether\r\nrates are fair and reasonable for given areas.\" Boardman explained:\r\n\r\n            When Kemper revises its rates, it notifies network\r\n            and non-network glass shops in advance of the fair\r\n            and reasonable rates it approves for glass claims.\r\n            Kemper does not dictate what the shops should\r\n            charge a customer, Kemper merely informs the shops\r\n            what it is paying based on the insured's automobile\r\n            policy and law.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Boardman's affidavit stated:\r\n\n            Rates are also shared with insured's [sic] and shops\r\n            when the insured contacts Kemper, via Safelite, to\r\n            report the glass claim.        A customer service\r\n            representative at Safelite contacts the shop of the\r\n            claimant's choice during the claim call to inform\r\n            them of the rates before the shop begins working on\r\n            the claimant's vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe affidavit further stated, \"After the shop agrees or understands what the\r\nrates are being paid by Kemper via Safelite on the phone, the shop receives a\r\nreferral sheet once again confirming the rates Kemper will pay before [the]\r\nshop begins work on the claimant's vehicle.\" Boardman provided, \"When the\r\nglass work has been completed, Kemper pays the claim based on the rate pre-\r\nnotified and usually agreed upon by the glass shop.\"\r\n\r\n      Kemper also attached a document dated March 25, 2009, from Safelite\r\nSolutions addressed to Southern Glass and referencing Matthew Keefe as the\r\ncustomer. The document listed the following prices:\r\n\r\n            W/S LIST: -37.0% LABR: $41.00 PER HOUR\r\n            C/T LIST: -37.0% LABR: $41.00 PER HOUR\r\n            KIT: $15.00       2KIT: $30.00\r\n            H/M KIT: $25.00   H/M 2KIT: $45.00\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the document provided, \"KEMPER has determined the\r\nmaximum amount of such work is : $ 483.82 [sic] less any applicable\r\ndeductible amount.\" The document also stated, \"Performance of services\r\nconstitutes acceptance of the communicated price and billing instructions.\"\r\nKemper attached an auto insurance policy as well. The policy stated, \"Our\r\nlimit of liability for loss will be the lesser of the: 1. Actual cash value of the\r\nstolen or damaged property; or 2. Amount necessary to repair or replace the\r\nproperty with other property of like kind and quality.\" The policy also stated,\r\n\"We will pay . . . for loss to safety glass on 'your covered auto' without\r\napplying a deductible.\"\r\n\r\n      Southern Glass filed a memorandum in opposition to Kemper's motion\r\nfor summary judgment and submitted an affidavit by its president, Alan S.\r\n\nEpley, stating, \"Each time Safelite calls to inform us of the rates, we tell the\r\nemployee of Safelite that Southern Glass does not accept the quoted rates.\"\r\nHe further stated, \"I have informed Safelite on more than one occasion that\r\nno contract is created when my company does the work.\" Epley also\r\nprovided, \"I have also notified Kemper and other insurance companies,\r\ndirectly or through Safelite, that our only contract is with our customer, the\r\ninsured[,] and the customer has assigned to Southern Glass its right to receive\r\npayment pursuant to the terms of the policy.\"\r\n\r\n      At the hearing on the motion, Kemper stated it had recordings of all the\r\ntelephone conversations from when Southern Glass and the insured called\r\nSafelite and had brought copies to the hearing. Kemper stated it had not\r\nattached the transcripts to its memorandum as an exhibit because it did not\r\ncome up until Southern Glass's response memorandum, filed two days before\r\nthe hearing. The trial court took a break to give Southern Glass the\r\nopportunity to review the transcripts. After Southern Glass had reviewed the\r\ntranscripts, Kemper began to address the transcripts, and Southern Glass\r\nstated, \"I would object to the introduction --\" The court responded, \"I note\r\nyour objection. I'm going to accept it anyway.\" Southern Glass asked, \"You\r\nwant to hear the grounds?\" and the court responded, \"Go ahead and put them\r\non the record.\" However, Kemper then began describing the content of the\r\ntranscripts and the objection was not discussed any further.\r\n\r\n      Kemper submitted a transcript from a recorded telephone call between\r\nan employee of Southern Glass and Safelite, as well as customer Luther\r\nMcDaniel. In that conversation, Safelite stated, \"I just need to know if you\r\naccept the job at the following pricing. . . . NAGS list minus thirty[-]seven\r\npercent, labor is $41.00 hourly and $15.00 per kit.\" The employee of\r\nSouthern Glass stated, \"We accept the job.\" Safelite stated, \"Thank you.\r\nYour acceptance of the job also indicates that you have accepted these rates\r\nand these prices do not include tax or the cost of molding.\"\r\n\r\n       The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, finding\r\n\"[t]he existence of a binding enforceable contract is evidenced by transcripts\r\nof telephone conversations between [Southern Glass's] representative (a shop\r\nemployee), [Southern Glass's] customer ([Kemper's] insureds), and\r\n[Kemper's] third[-]party administrator (Safelite Solutions) wherein the glass\r\n\nclaim was reported and express offer was made by Safelite on behalf of\r\n[Kemper].\" The court determined \"the telephone transcript evidences not\r\nonly an express offer on behalf of [Kemper], but also an express acceptance\r\non behalf of [Southern Glass].\" The trial court found \"[t]he offer was further\r\nconfirmed in a fax sent by [Kemper's] third[-] party administrator to\r\n[Southern Glass] prior to the work being performed on the customer's\r\nvehicle,\" which \"also stated: 'Performance of services constitutes acceptance\r\nof the above price and billing instructions.'\" The court noted:\r\n\r\n           After [Southern Glass] verbally agreed to [Kemper's]\r\n           rates over the telephone and received the work order\r\n           confirming the rates, it performed the glass work\r\n           without objection or further communication with\r\n           [Kemper's] third[-]party administrator. Thereafter,\r\n           [Southern Glass] further confirmed its acceptance of\r\n           [Kemper's] rates when it accepted and negotiated\r\n           checks in the amount specified by the work order.\r\n\r\nSouthern Glass filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rules 52(b) and\r\n59(e), SCRCP. In regards to the telephone transcript, Southern Glass stated\r\nin a footnote in the motion, \"[Southern Glass] objected to introduction of the\r\ntranscript into evidence on the grounds that it had not been presented to\r\ncounsel prior to the hearing. It was a surprise to counsel and prejudiced\r\n[Southern Glass's] case.\" The trial court denied the motion. This appeal\r\nfollowed.               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of\r\ncases not requiring the services of a fact finder. George v. Fabri, 345 S.C.\r\n440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). When reviewing the grant of a\r\nsummary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard that governs\r\nthe trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when\r\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493,\r\n567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In determining whether a genuine issue of fact\r\nexists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it must be\r\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub.\r\nServ. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003). \"Once\r\nthe moving party carries its initial burden, the opposing party must come\r\nforward with specific facts that show there is a genuine issue of fact\r\nremaining for trial.\" Sides v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 250, 255, 607\r\nS.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2004). \"[A]ssertions as to liability must be more\r\nthan mere bald allegations made by the non-moving party in order to create a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact.\" Jackson v. Bermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C. 11,\r\n17, 677 S.E.2d 612, 616 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\n                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Summary Judgment\r\n\r\n      Southern Glass argues the trial court erred in granting the motion for\r\nsummary judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact as\r\nSouthern Glass disputed the existence of a unilateral contract by Epley's\r\naffidavit and its argument at the summary judgment hearing. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"The purpose of all rules of construction is to ascertain the intention of\r\nthe parties to the contract.\" Hansen ex rel. Hansen v. United Servs. Auto.\r\nAss'n, 350 S.C. 62, 68, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). \"The construction and enforcement of an\r\nunambiguous contract is a question of law for the court, and thus can be\r\nproperly disposed of at summary judgment.\" Id. at 67, 565 S.E.2d at 116\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). When the terms of a contract are\r\nambiguous, the question of the parties' intent must be submitted to the jury.\r\nId. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 116.\r\n\r\n            A contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more\r\n            than one meaning when viewed objectively by a\r\n            reasonably intelligent person who has examined the\r\n            context of the entire integrated agreement and who is\r\n            cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and\r\n            terminology as generally understood in the particular\r\n            trade or business.\r\n\nId. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 116-17 (internal quotations marks omitted).\r\nAdditionally, a contract is only ambiguous when it may fairly and reasonably\r\nbe understood in more than one way. Id. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 117. \"[I]n\r\nconstruing an insurance contract, all of its provisions should be considered,\r\nand one may not, by pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an\r\nambiguity.\" Id. (alteration by court) (internal quotations marks omitted).\r\n\r\n      \"The necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and\r\nvaluable consideration. A valid offer 'identifies the bargained for exchange\r\nand creates a power of acceptance in the offeree.'\" Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\nAuth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003) (quoting\r\nCarolina Amusement Co. v. Conn. Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 215, 437\r\nS.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 1993)). \"A unilateral contract occurs when there is only\r\none promisor and the other party accepts, not by mutual promise, but by\r\nactual performance. A bilateral contract, on the other hand, exists when both\r\nparties exchange mutual promises.\" Id. at 405, 581 S.E.2d at 165-66 (citation\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\n       The elements for a breach of contract are the existence of the contract,\r\nits breach, and the damages caused by such breach. Fuller v. E. Fire & Cas.\r\nIns. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962). \"The general rule is\r\nthat for a breach of contract the defendant is liable for whatever damages\r\nfollow as a natural consequence and a proximate result of such breach.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      A few courts across the country have considered a similar issue to the\r\npresent case. In a North Carolina case:\r\n\r\n            [T]he trial court based its judgment on three grounds:\r\n            (1) GMAC[, an insurance company,] complied with\r\n            the terms of its insurance contract; (2) GMAC paid\r\n            defendant[, a glass company,] in accordance with\r\n            unilateral contracts GMAC entered into with\r\n            defendant; and (3) defendant's actions in cashing\r\n            checks sent to it by GMAC, knowing that GMAC\r\n            considered those payments \"final,\" constituted an\r\n            accord and satisfaction of any potential claim\r\n            defendant might assert.\r\n\nCIM Ins. Corp. v. Cascade Auto Glass, Inc., 660 S.E.2d 907, 910 (N.C. Ct.\r\nApp. 2008). The North Carolina Court of Appeals recognized, \"A unilateral\r\ncontract is formed when one party makes a promise and expressly or\r\nimpliedly invites the other party to perform some act as a condition for\r\nmaking the promise binding on the promisor.\" Id. The court provided that\r\nGMAC communicated through Safelite the prices it was willing to pay to\r\ndefendant for services rendered to its insureds. Id. The court found the\r\nprices were communicated \"(1) via letter to defendant's shops, (2) via\r\ntelephone when initial claims were made, (3) via confirmation fax after\r\nclaims were made but before work was performed, and (4) via eventual\r\npayment of invoices at the GMAC rate rather than defendant's rate.\" Id.\r\n\"The confirmation faxes stated, '[p]erformance of services constitutes\r\nacceptance of the above price. . . .'\" Id. (alterations by court). \"Although\r\ndefendant protested the stated prices, these protests admitted that the\r\nconfirmation faxes constituted offers-'The purpose of this letter is to address\r\n[the confirmation faxes] and to dispel any notion that we are in agreement\r\nwith the offered pricing.'\" Id. (alteration by court).\r\n\r\n      The court noted, \"It is a fundamental concept of contract law that the\r\nofferor is the master of his offer. He is entitled to require acceptance in\r\nprecise conformity with his offer before a contract is formed.\" Id. (internal\r\nquotations marks omitted). \"Here, the offer stated that acceptance was by\r\nperformance. Because defendant performed the requested repairs or\r\nreplacements, it accepted the terms of GMAC's offers, forming valid\r\nunilateral contracts at GMAC's stated prices.\" Id. \"GMAC paid defendant\r\npursuant to the terms of the unilateral contracts entered into between the\r\nparties. Defendant has not been 'underpaid' and is due no further payments.\r\nTherefore, summary judgment was properly granted against defendant.\" Id.\r\n\r\n     The Idaho Supreme Court has also considered a similar issue, finding\r\nFarm Bureau Insurance Company clearly stated it would pay the amount it\r\nagreed to and it had notified Cascade, a glass company, in advance the rates it\r\nwould pay for glass repair and replacement. Cascade Auto Glass, Inc. v.\r\nIdaho Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 115 P.3d 751, 755 (Idaho 2005). The court\r\nfound:\r\n\n           Cascade had one of three options available to it upon\r\n           receiving Farm Bureau's notice: it could simply do\r\n           the work and accept the amount Farm Bureau had\r\n           stated it would pay; it could accept the insurance\r\n           payment and collect the difference from the insured;\r\n           or it could refuse to perform services for Farm\r\n           Bureau insureds unless the customer paid it for the\r\n           work, leaving the customer to seek reimbursement\r\n           from Farm Bureau.\r\n\r\nId. The court determined, \"Cascade was unquestionably on notice of the\r\namount Farm Bureau would pay and, nevertheless, proceeded with the work,\r\nknowing there was a limit on the amount it would receive. Farm Bureau paid\r\nthe amount it had agreed to pay and has fulfilled its obligations under the\r\npolicy.\" Id. The court further found:\r\n\r\n           [T]he provisions of the insurance policy clearly\r\n           provide that Farm Bureau can make a unilateral\r\n           agreement about what amounts it will pay for\r\n           windshield replacement or repair services. There is\r\n           no issue of fact that once it made that determination,\r\n           it provided notice in advance to all of the glass\r\n           companies. The facts are also undisputed that\r\n           Cascade accepted these Farm Bureau insured\r\n           customers, agreed to provide the work, provided\r\n           materials of like kind and quality, and was paid in\r\n           full in the amount Farm Bureau had previously\r\n           indicated it would pay. Therefore, Cascade has been\r\n           paid all the money to which it was entitled under the\r\n           policy and there is no breach of the insurance\r\n           contract.\r\n\r\nId.   The Washington Court of Appeals has also considered a comparable\r\ncase, which examines a somewhat different issue. Cascade Auto Glass, Inc.\r\nv. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 145 P.3d 1253 (Wash. Ct. App. 2006). In that\r\n\ncase, Cascade argued Safelite could not terminate the agreement between\r\nCascade and Progressive because it was not a party to it. Id. at 1255. The\r\ncourt found, \"Progressive presented unrebutted evidence that Safelite had\r\nauthority to act as its agent in the price setting correspondence.\" Id. Cascade\r\nalso argued, \"Progressive's superseding letters were simply an attempt to\r\nunilaterally modify the terms of the pricing agreement, which Progressive\r\ncould not do.\" Id. Cascade asserted the termination notice was deficient for\r\ntwo reasons: (1) \"because the letters were unsigned and mass-mailed, they\r\nfailed to give adequate notice to any particular glass shop that Progressive\r\nwas terminating its pricing agreement\" and (2) \"the letters purported to\r\nunilaterally modify the terms of the pricing agreement rather than terminate\r\nthe agreement altogether.\" Id. at 1256.\r\n\r\n       The Washington Court of Appeals found, \"Progressive's superseding\r\nletters clearly signaled that it was no longer willing to pay according to the\r\npricing agreement. Instead, Progressive offered to pay according to its new\r\npricing standards. Cascade accepted Progressive's offer by performing glass\r\nwork for Progressive's insureds.\" Id. at 1257-58. \"A unilateral contract\r\nexists when one party offers to do a certain thing in exchange for the other's\r\nperformance, and performance by the other party constitutes acceptance.\" Id.\r\nat 1258. The court held, \"Cascade created binding unilateral contracts each\r\ntime it repaired or replaced auto glass for Progressive's insureds after\r\nreceiving Progressive's new offer. Progressive owes the amounts it promised\r\nto pay in the superseding letters; Cascade is entitled to no more than those\r\namounts.\" Id.\r\n\r\n     The Connecticut Supreme Court has also looked at a similar situation\r\nbut with differing results. Auto Glass Express, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., 975\r\nA.2d 1266 (Conn. 2009). In that case, the court found:\r\n\r\n            According to the plain language of the pricing letters,\r\n            the only exchange proposed by the defendant is its\r\n            promise to pay bills timely in exchange for the\r\n            submission of bills that do not exceed its proposed\r\n            pricing structure: \"Bills that are accurate and are not\r\n            more than this pricing structure will be paid promptly\r\n            as submitted.\" In fact, the pricing letters, read as a\r\n\n           whole, reinforce this interpretation. . . . The very first\r\n           paragraph of the pricing letters sets forth the purpose\r\n           of the letters, namely, \"[t]o facilitate timely payment\r\n           of invoices and avoid misunderstandings. . . .\"\r\n\r\nId. at 1273 (emphases added by court).\r\n\r\n     The court determined:\r\n\r\n           [N]othing in the language of the pricing letters, either\r\n           expressly or impliedly, suggests that the mere\r\n           performance of glass repairs on automobiles insured\r\n           by the defendant was sufficient to bind the plaintiffs\r\n           to the defendant's prices. The pricing letters also do\r\n           not indicate how the defendant intended to address\r\n           invoices that did not conform to its pricing standards.\r\n           The defendant's statement that its pricing structure\r\n           represented what it believed to be \"fair and\r\n           reasonable prices for the market\" failed to convey\r\n           any intent that higher prices were unfair or\r\n           unreasonable and would not be paid. Thus, we agree\r\n           with the Appellate Court's observation that \"[t]he\r\n           [pricing] letters, therefore, do not evidence an\r\n           intention on the part of the defendant not to pay a\r\n           greater amount, but rather an intention not to pay a\r\n           greater amount 'promptly.'\" Further, the statement in\r\n           the pricing letter that \"[t]he prices listed [superseded]\r\n           any prior pricing agreements,\" sheds no light on what\r\n           performance was required in order to accept the\r\n           defendant's new price terms. Because the plain\r\n           language of the pricing letters clearly and\r\n           unambiguously required the plaintiffs to submit\r\n           invoices that reflected the pricing standards set forth\r\n           in those letters in order to accept the defendant's offer\r\n           of timely payment, and did not restrict the plaintiffs\r\n           from submitting invoices reflecting higher prices, we\r\n\n            need not look beyond the pricing letters to ascertain\r\n            the defendant's intent.\r\n\r\nId. at 1273-74 (alterations by court) (footnote and citation omitted). The\r\ncourt held, \"In light of the clear and unambiguous language of the pricing\r\nletters, we conclude that, in order for unilateral contracts to have been\r\nformed, the plaintiffs would have been required to accept the prices stated in\r\nthose letters by submitting invoices that conformed to those prices.\" Id. at\r\n1274. \"The plaintiffs did not submit conforming invoices, and, therefore, the\r\ntrial court improperly concluded that the parties had formed a series of\r\nunilateral contracts that supplied the amounts due from the defendant under\r\nthe assigned insurance policies.\" Id. at 1275.\r\n\r\n        The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also undertaken an analysis of\r\nan analogous scenario. Alpine Glass, Inc. v. Ill. Farmers Ins. Co., 643 F.3d\r\n659 (8th Cir. 2011). In that case, \"Farmers contend[ed] that the district court\r\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Alpine[, a glass company,]\r\non Farmers's breach-of-contract counterclaim. Farmers argue[d] that the price\r\nlists it faxed to Alpine constituted offers and that Alpine accepted the offers\r\nwhen it performed auto-glass work on behalf of Farmers's insureds.\" Id. at\r\n666. The court noted, \"To form a unilateral contract, Minnesota law requires\r\na definite offer, communication of the offer, acceptance, and consideration.\r\nAn offer must contain sufficiently definite terms to enable the fact-finder to\r\ninterpret and apply them.\" Id. (footnote, citation, and internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). \"Acceptance must be unequivocal and comply exactly with\r\nthe requirements of the offer. If the purported acceptance changes the terms\r\nof the offer, it is not positive and unequivocal, and constitutes a rejection of\r\nthe offer and a counteroffer.\" Id. (citation and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\n      The court found:\r\n\r\n            Even if the blast faxes constituted offers to enter into\r\n            unilateral contracts, Alpine rejected the offers when\r\n            its actions failed to conform to the terms of the offer.\r\n            The June 2002 fax informed the \"Shop\r\n            Owner/Manager\" that Farmers had updated its\r\n\n            pricing standards. The fax read, \"To facilitate timely\r\n            payment of invoices and avoid misunderstandings,\r\n            please be sure to price all Farmers Insurance\r\n            transactions in accordance with the prices indicated\r\n            below.\" After listing the pricing structure and noting\r\n            that it superseded previous pricing agreements, the\r\n            document explained how to submit invoices and\r\n            stated that \"[b]ills that are accurate and are not more\r\n            than this pricing structure will be paid promptly as\r\n            submitted.\" Given the language of the document,\r\n            mere performance of auto-glass work on the vehicles\r\n            of Farmers's insureds did not constitute acceptance\r\n            because the terms of the purported offer required that\r\n            Alpine submit invoices in accordance with Farmers's\r\n            pricing structure. There is no dispute that Alpine's\r\n            invoices did not conform with Farmers's pricing\r\n            structure.\r\n\r\nId. at 666-67 (alteration by court). The court further provided:\r\n\r\n            The February 2005 fax included the same\r\n            information as the June 2002 fax and went on to\r\n            advise Alpine that it \"may consider refusing the job if\r\n            you are unwilling to provide service at the prices\r\n            Farmers Insurance has offered above.\" The fax also\r\n            provided that Alpine's rejection of the pricing terms\r\n            would not \"be binding on us or otherwise require us\r\n            to pay you additional sums for services rendered\" and\r\n            that if Alpine desired to charge more than the pricing\r\n            structure permitted, it \"must advise our policyholders\r\n            prior to initiating glass repair/replacement so that\r\n            they can determine whether they are willing to pay\r\n            the additional costs for your services.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 667. The court determined \"mere performance of auto-glass work did\r\nnot constitute acceptance, and Alpine did not comply with the pricing\r\n\nrequirements or the additional terms set forth in Farmers's purported offer.\"\r\nId.    The present case can be distinguished from the Connecticut and the\r\nEighth Circuit cases. In those cases, the courts noted that the company had\r\nmerely stated that billing at those rates would result in timely payment. The\r\npresent case is more in line with the North Carolina, Idaho, and Washington\r\ncases. In this case, Kemper notified Southern Glass of the rates and stated\r\n\"performance of services irrevocable constitutes acceptance of the above\r\nprice and billing instructions.\" Additionally, Southern Glass accepted the\r\nprices in the phone conversation. By proceeding with the work after\r\nreceiving notice of the prices via phone conversation and fax, Southern Glass\r\naccepted the prices. Southern Glass argues that the court only considered one\r\ntelephone transcript in making its decision. However, at the hearing, Kemper\r\nstated that it had transcripts for all of the conversations between Southern\r\nGlass and Safelite. Kemper read to the court one of those transcripts, and\r\nthat transcript is in the record. Southern Glass made no argument at the\r\nhearing that the transcript only represented one of the claims. Further,\r\nSouthern Glass put up no evidence to show it had contacted Safelite or\r\nKemper after receiving the fax to reject the prices in it. Accordingly, because\r\nthe evidence does not create a genuine issue of material fact that Kemper\r\nbreached its contract with Southern Glass, the trial court did not err in\r\ngranting Kemper summary judgment.\r\n\r\nII.   Introduction of the Transcript\r\n\r\n      Southern Glass argues the trial court erred in allowing Kemper to\r\nsubmit copies of alleged transcripts of telephone conversations as its\r\nintroduction was a surprise and extremely prejudicial because it had no\r\nopportunity to refute the fact that the employee had no authority to bind the\r\ncompany. It also argues the transcript was not signed or certified. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n       Southern Glass's memo opposing summary judgment was filed two\r\ndays before the hearing, and Epley's affidavit, which is the first time Southern\r\nGlass asserted that it had informed Kemper that it rejected its pricing, was\r\nalso filed two days before the hearing. The court gave Southern Glass a short\r\n\ntime to review the documents, and Southern Glass did not request a\r\ncontinuance. Therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing the transcript.\r\nAdditionally, a unilateral contract was created by Southern Glass's\r\nperforming the work on Kemper's insureds, not by Southern Glass's verbal\r\nresponse. Thus, the transcript of the conversation did not prejudice Southern\r\nGlass. See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App.\r\n1987) (\"[W]hatever doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.\"). Further,\r\nthe argument pertaining to the transcript not being certified or signed is\r\nabandoned because Southern Glass makes only a passing reference to it in its\r\nbrief and cites no case law for the argument. See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid.\r\n& Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"[S]hort,\r\nconclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed\r\nabandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.\").\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      The trial court did not err in finding no genuine issue of material fact\r\nexisted and granting summary judgment. Further, any admission of the\r\ntranscript was not in error. Therefore, the grant of summary judgment is\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      PIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5022","title":"Collins v.

(West), Seko\r\nWorldwide, Federal Insurance Co., Seko Charlotte (Seko), Nationwide Mutual\r\nInsurance Co., and the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Uninsured\r\nEmployers' Fund (the Fund). The Fund appeals the order of the Appellate Panel of\r\nthe South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission),\r\narguing it erred in: (1) finding Collins was not Seko's statutory employee; (2)\r\nfinding the \"going and coming rule\" barred Collins' recovery as to West, but not as\r\nto Seko; (3) finding Collins was a \"traveling employee\" as to West, but not as to\r\nSeko; (4) finding the method of payment was dispositive in determining the\r\nstatutory employment relationship; (5) applying Georgia law; and (6) finding\r\nCollins would have been a gratuitous worker if considered a statutory employee of\r\nSeko at the time of his accident. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nCollins, a South Carolina resident, was hired by West, a South Carolina expedited\r\ndelivery company, to drive a delivery van. Seko Charlotte (Seko) contracted with\r\nWest for a delivery of parts from Ina Bearing Company in Spartanburg, South\r\nCarolina, to Wauwatosa and Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. On September 7,\r\n2007, Collins picked up the parts and delivered them to Seko's customers in\r\nWisconsin. While driving back to South Carolina on September 8, Collins was\r\nkilled in an automobile accident. This claim was filed. At the time of the accident,\r\nWest's workers' compensation coverage had lapsed, and the Fund participated in\r\nthe case.\r\n\nRonald Burks, Seko's general manager, testified that Seko is a transportation\r\nlogistics company providing regional, national, and international transportation\r\nservices. Seko employed three drivers among its sixteen employees. These drivers\r\nmade deliveries within a hundred miles of Charlotte. Seko subcontracted longer\r\ntrips to companies such as West.\r\n\r\nBurks testified West provided \"express hot deliver[y]\" services, which are required\r\nwhen a customer needs immediate delivery and cannot wait for a full truck load to\r\ndeliver in their area. As he explained, West provided services for cargo that \"needs\r\nto get . . . somewhere faster than an LTL [less than a truck load] truck would\" be\r\nable to deliver.\r\n\r\nBurks testified Seko did not have a written contract with West. Seko paid West\r\n$1.20 per loaded mile, one way. Seko utilized West's services approximately two\r\nto three times per month and contracted with four or five companies comparable to\r\nWest, similarly paying them per mile, one way. Seko's contention was that once a\r\ndelivery was made, its agreement with West ceased. In this case, Collins had no\r\ncargo in the van during the return trip to South Carolina, and Seko accordingly\r\nmaintained he was no longer its statutory employee.\r\n\r\nBurks admitted that if Collins had been Seko's employee at the time of the injury,\r\nhe would have a valid workers' compensation claim against Seko. He conceded\r\nthat the Seko drivers were covered by Seko's workers' compensation insurance on\r\ntheir entire trips, rather than just on the way to the delivery site. Burks admitted he\r\nknew West's drivers would return to South Carolina because they were based here,\r\nbut insisted Seko's relationship with Collins ceased after he made his deliveries in\r\nWisconsin. Burks conceded such deliveries were an important and necessary part\r\nof Seko's business.\r\n\r\nWest's president, Morris West, testified the drivers generally do not have cargo on\r\ntheir return trips to South Carolina, and in Collins' case, he did not have cargo on\r\nhis return trip. Morris also testified West was free to contract with another\r\ncompany for return loads, and Seko had no relationship with his drivers once a\r\ndelivery was made.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner found Seko was Collins' statutory employer. Seko\r\nappealed to the Commission. At the hearing before the Commission, Seko\r\nconceded it was Collins' statutory employer for the trip from South Carolina to\r\nWisconsin. It maintained Collins was West's employee during the return trip.\r\n\nSeko argued it no longer had control over Collins after his delivery in Wisconsin,\r\nand its status as a statutory employer thus ceased upon delivery. The Fund argued\r\nthe issue of control was not relevant to a determination of statutory employment.\r\n\r\nThe Commission found Collins was Seko's statutory employee during his trip to\r\nWisconsin, but Seko did not maintain the degree of control over Collins during the\r\nreturn trip to continue the employment relationship. Furthermore, the Commission\r\nfound Collins was no longer Seko's employee within the \"going and coming rule.\"\r\nFinding this a case of first impression in South Carolina, the Commission relied on\r\nGeorgia and North Carolina law to conclude Collins was no longer Seko's statutory\r\nemployee at the time of the accident. Therefore, the Commission found the Fund\r\nwas liable for the claim. The Fund appealed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nCoverage under the Workers' Compensation Act (the Act) depends on the\r\nexistence of an employment relationship. Posey v. Proper Mold & Eng'g, Inc., 378\r\nS.C. 210, 216, 661 S.E.2d 395, 398 (Ct. App. 2008). \"Whether or not an\r\nemployer-employee relationship exists is a jurisdictional question.\" Id. Where the\r\nissue involves jurisdiction, the appellate court can take its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence. Id. at 216-17, 661 S.E.2d at 399. \"It is the policy\r\nof South Carolina courts to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of\r\nemployers and employees under the Workers' Compensation Act.\" Id. at 217, 661\r\nS.E.2d at 399; see Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 382\r\nS.C. 295, 300, 676 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2009) (rejecting the analytical framework of\r\ndistinguishing between an employee and an independent contractor that \"most\r\nassuredly skews the analysis to a finding of employment\" while \"remain[ing]\r\nsensitive to the general principle sanctioned by the Legislature that workers'\r\ncompensation laws are to be construed liberally in favor of coverage\").\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe Fund argues the Commission erred in finding Collins was no longer Seko's\r\nstatutory employee at the time of his accident. We agree.\r\n\r\nStatutory employment is an exception to the general rule that coverage under the\r\nAct requires the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Posey v. Proper\r\nMold & Eng'g, Inc., 378 S.C. 210, 217, 661 S.E.2d 395, 399 (Ct. App. 2008). \"The\r\nstatutory employee doctrine converts conceded non-employees into employees for\r\n\npurposes of the Workers' Compensation Act. The rationale is to prevent owners\r\nand contractors from subcontracting out their work to avoid liability for injuries\r\nincurred in the course of employment.\" Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C. 198,\r\n201 n.1, 482 S.E.2d 49, 50 n.1 (1997). \"The effect of these [statutory employment]\r\nprovisions when brought into operation is to impose the absolute liability of an\r\nimmediate employer upon the owner and/or general contractor although it was not\r\nin law the immediate employer of the injured workman.\" Parker v. Williams &\r\nMadjanik, Inc., 275 S.C. 65, 72, 267 S.E.2d 524, 527-28 (1980).\r\n\r\nThe statutory employment section of the Act provides:\r\n\r\n            When any person, in this section . . . referred to as\r\n            \"owner,\" undertakes to perform or execute any work\r\n            which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and\r\n            contracts with any other person (in this section . . .\r\n            referred to as \"subcontractor\") for the execution or\r\n            performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole\r\n            or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the\r\n            owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in\r\n            the work any compensation under this Title which he\r\n            would have been liable to pay if the workman had been\r\n            immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-400 (1985).\r\n\r\nThe Commission found Collins was not Seko's statutory employee based primarily\r\non Seko's lack of control over Collins at the time of his accident. See Wilkinson,\r\n382 S.C. at 299, 676 S.E.2d at 702 (recognizing the four-factor test to determine\r\nwhether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor: (1) right to, or\r\nexercise of, control; (2) furnishing of equipment; (3) method of payment; and (4)\r\nright to fire).1 The Commission also relied on case law from Georgia and North\r\n\r\n1 In discussing the going and coming, gratuitous worker, and traveling employee\r\ndoctrines, the Commission likewise focused on Seko's method of payment or\r\ncontrol over Collins at the time of the accident. See Whitworth v. Window World,\r\nInc., 377 S.C. 637, 641, 661 S.E.2d 333, 336 (2008) (\"Under the going and coming\r\nrule, an employee going to or coming from the place where his work is to be\r\nperformed is not engaged in performing any service growing out of and incidental\r\nto his employment. Therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such time is not\r\n\nCarolina to find no statutory employment relationship. In Farmer v. Ryder Truck\r\nLines, Inc., 266 S.E.2d 922 (Ga. 1980), the Georgia Supreme Court began its\r\nanalysis of control stating the statutory employment statute was inapplicable in that\r\ncase. Farmer, 266 S.E.2d at 924. In Lewis v. Barnhill, 148 S.E.2d 536 (N.C.\r\n1966), the North Carolina Supreme Court employed the borrowed servant doctrine2\r\nwithout mentioning a statutory employment statute in Lewis' tort action. Lewis,\r\n148 S.E.2d at 543.\r\n\r\nWe find the Commission erroneously utilized the \"employee/independent\r\ncontractor\" test to determine whether Collins was Seko's statutory employee. We\r\nalso find neither the Georgia nor North Carolina case relied on by the Commission\r\nis dispositive.\r\n\r\nIn Voss v. Ramco, Inc., 325 S.C. 560, 566, 482 S.E.2d 582, 585 (Ct. App. 1997),\r\nthis court found that whether the employee was an independent contractor of the\r\nalleged statutory employer was irrelevant. The court concluded that \"section 42-1-\r\n400 imposes liability on an upstream employer if the injured worker is an\r\nemployee of the subcontractor, but not if the worker is an independent contractor\r\nof the subcontractor.\" 325 S.C. at 566-67, 482 S.E.2d at 585. The Fourth Circuit\r\nCourt of Appeals likewise stated that whether the statutory employer exercised\r\ncontrol over the employee is not the issue in South Carolina:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensable under the Workers' Compensation Act because it does not arise out of\r\nand in the course of his employment.\"); Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 314 S.C.\r\n43, 45, 443 S.E.2d 803, 804 (1994) (holding gratuitous workers are not\r\nemployees); Hall v. Desert Aire, Inc., 376 S.C. 338, 357, 656 S.E.2d 753, 762 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2007) (\"It is well settled that 'traveling employees are generally within the\r\ncourse of their employment from the time they leave home on a business trip until\r\nthey return, for the self-evident reason that the traveling itself is a large part of the\r\njob.'\") (quoting Arthur Larson, Larson's Worker[s]' Compensation Law, § 14.01\r\n(Lexis-Nexis 2004)).\r\n2 Under South Carolina's borrowed servant doctrine, \"when a general employer\r\nlends an employee to a special employer, that special employer is liable for\r\nworkers' compensation if: (1) there is a contract of hire between the employee and\r\nthe special employer; (2) the work being done by the employee is essentially that\r\nof the special employer; and (3) the special employer has the right to control the\r\ndetails of the employee's work.\" Cooke v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 367 S.C. 167,\r\n175, 624 S.E.2d 439, 443 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\n             Suffice it to say that no South Carolina case has been\r\n             found involving this statute in which an owner's liability\r\n             either for payment of compensation or tort damages has\r\n             been made to rest upon the degree of control retained by\r\n             the owner over the injured employee of a subcontractor.\r\n             On the contrary, once it is established that the work being\r\n             done by the subcontractor is a part of the owner's general\r\n             business, the employees of the subcontractor become\r\n             statutory employees of the owner even though their\r\n             immediate employer is an independent contractor.\r\n\r\nCorollo v. S. S. Kresge Co., 456 F.2d 306, 311 (4th Cir. 1972).\r\n\r\nOnce the Commission determined Collins was an employee of Seko's\r\nsubcontractor, West, which the parties in this case did not dispute, the Commission\r\nshould have looked to whether Collins' activities were part of Seko's trade,\r\nbusiness, or occupation. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-400 (1985) (providing\r\nstatutory employment requires the claimant to be engaged in an activity that \"is a\r\npart of [Seko's] trade, business[,] or occupation\"). South Carolina has applied\r\nthree tests and concludes the statutory requirement is met if the activity (1) is an\r\nimportant part of the owner's business or trade; (2) is a necessary, essential, and\r\nintegral part of the owner's business; or (3) has previously been performed by the\r\nowner's employees. Olmstead v. Shakespeare, 354 S.C. 421, 424, 581 S.E.2d 483,\r\n485 (2003). If the activity meets any of these three criteria, the injured employee\r\nqualifies as a statutory employee. Id. In this case, Burks admitted deliveries like\r\nthe one Collins made were an important and necessary part of Seko's business. We\r\nagree that Seko's utilization of West's services two to three times per month for\r\n\"express hot deliveries\" is an important part of Seko's delivery business.\r\nAccordingly, we find Collins was Seko's statutory employee during the entire trip.\r\nSee Voss, 325 S.C. at 568, 482 S.E.2d at 586 (finding a manufacturer of small\r\nequipment was the statutory employer of field salespeople because selling the\r\nequipment was an essential part of the manufacturer's business); Marchbanks v.\r\nDuke Power Co., 190 S.C. 336, 351, 2 S.E.2d 825, 837-38 (1939) (affirming the\r\ntrial court's finding that maintenance of Duke Power's transmission lines and utility\r\npoles was an important and essential part of its trade or business and, therefore,\r\nfinding Duke Power the statutory employer of the employee of a subcontractor\r\nhired to paint utility poles).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the Commission employed improper analyses in\r\nreversing the single commissioner. Under our own view of the preponderance of\r\nthe evidence, we find Collins was Seko's statutory employee. Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the Commission and reinstate the single commissioner's order.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I concur in the majority opinion. I write separately to\r\nfurther explain why it was error for the commission to use the independent\r\ncontractor test to determine whether Collins was Seko's statutory employee. There\r\nis no reason to consider whether a claimant is a statutory employee unless the\r\nclaimant or his direct employer has an independent contractor relationship with the\r\ndefendant. Therefore, it is nonsensical to determine Collins was not the statutory\r\nemployee of Seko because of the independent contractor relationship between\r\nSeko and West. Rather, Collins can be a statutory employee of Seko only if there\r\nis an independent contractor relationship between Seko and West.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5023","title":"Holmes v.

We affirm as modified.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1978 and had two children. The parties\r\nseparated in 2006, and on October 5, 2007, the family court found Wife was\r\nentitled to a divorce from Husband based on one year's continuous separation. The\r\ndivorce decree incorporated a November 2006 settlement agreement entered into\r\nby the parties, which addressed child custody, child support, division of property,\r\nand alimony. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties agreed to joint\r\ncustody of their one minor child, with Wife as the primary custodian.1 At the time\r\nof the settlement, Husband's income was $72,000 per year, and he received a\r\n$16,500 bonus.2 Wife's annual income was $34,000. Based upon these figures,\r\nHusband agreed to pay Wife alimony in the amount of $600 per month plus 20%\r\nof his gross annual bonus. 3 Additionally, Husband agreed to pay Wife $400 per\r\nmonth in child support.\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, Husband lost his job with Milliken & Company through no fault of\r\nhis own after his position was eliminated. On March 4, 2010, Husband filed a\r\ncomplaint seeking a termination or reduction in his alimony payment, as well as\r\ndiscovery and attorney's fees.4 Wife subsequently filed an answer and\r\ncounterclaim denying Husband's request for termination or reduction in alimony,\r\nagreeing to discovery, and denying Husband's request for attorney's fees. The\r\nfamily court issued a temporary order on April 1, 2010, reducing Husband's\r\nalimony payment from $600 per month to $150 per month. The family court also\r\nrequired Husband to continue to pay Wife 20% of any bonuses he received.\r\nHusband held several jobs between August 2009 and October 2010, and has been\r\nemployed by American Credit Acceptance since November 2010.\r\n\r\nThe parties submitted updated financial declarations during a final hearing before\r\nthe family court in February 2011. In the declarations, Husband reported a gross\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1 The parties' daughter was sixteen-years-old at the time of the settlement \n\r\nagreement, and their son was eighteen-years-old. \n\r\n2 Husband testified he received a bonus every year, but it is unclear from the record \n\r\nwhether he received the same amount every year. \n\r\n3 After the divorce decree, the parties orally agreed to modify the terms of the \n\r\nalimony payment. Husband began paying Wife $875 per month in lieu of $600 \n\r\nplus bonuses.\n\r\n4 Husband's child support obligation terminated in May 2009 when the parties'\n\r\nminor child turned eighteen. \n\r\n\nmonthly income of $3,4185 ($41,016 per year), and Wife reported a gross monthly\r\nincome of $3,5086 ($42,096 per year). In an April 1, 2011 final order, the family\r\ncourt reinstated Husband's $600 per month alimony payment, but removed the\r\nrequirement that Husband pay Wife 20% of his gross bonuses each year. The\r\nfamily court found that at the time of the divorce decree, Husband's child support\r\nand alimony obligations equaled 16.7% of his gross income, excluding bonuses.\r\nThe court further found, based on Husband's current gross monthly income, a $600\r\nmonthly alimony payment would constitute 17.6% of Husband's gross income.\r\nThe court noted this was an increase of 0.9%. If the January 2011 bonus was not\r\nincluded in Husband's income, the family court found a $600 monthly payment\r\nwould constitute 19.6% of Husband's gross income. The court noted this was an\r\nincrease of 2.9%. Based on the above calculations, the family court held these\r\nincreases were not substantial and Husband should be required to pay Wife $600\r\nper month in alimony. The family court further found Husband failed to show he\r\nwas unable to pay Wife $600 per month. Husband subsequently filed a Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP, motion to reconsider arguing a $600 per month alimony payment\r\nwould create an undue hardship. The family court denied Husband's motion, and\r\nthis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The family court is a court of equity.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709\r\nS.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). In appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\nreviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414,\r\n709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). \"De novo review permits appellate court fact-finding,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of evidence supporting the [family] court's findings.\"\r\nLewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55. However, this broad standard of\r\nreview does not require the appellate court to disregard the factual findings of the\r\nfamily court or ignore the fact that the family court is in the better position to\r\nassess the credibility of the witnesses. Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544\r\nS.E.2d 620, 623 (2001). Moreover, the appellant is not relieved of the burden of\r\ndemonstrating error in the family court's findings of fact. Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d\r\nat 623. Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the family court in an equity\r\ncase unless its decision is controlled by some error of law or the appellant satisfies\r\nthe burden of showing the preponderance of the evidence actually supports\r\n                                                            \r\n5 Husband's gross monthly income included $468 in overtime and a $350 January \n\r\n2011 bonus. \n\r\n6 Wife has an associate's degree in medical lab technology and is employed by \n\r\nSpartanburg Regional Hospital. \n\r\n\ncontrary factual findings by this court. See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n654-55.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in requiring him to pay Wife $600 per\r\nmonth in alimony. We agree in part.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, to the extent\r\npossible, in the position she enjoyed during the marriage. Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C.\r\n177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001). However, upon a change in\r\ncircumstances, the family court may modify an alimony obligation. See Miles v.\r\nMiles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003). Section 20-3-170\r\nof the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n             Whenever any husband or wife, pursuant to a judgment\r\n             of divorce from the bonds of matrimony, has been\r\n             required to make his or her spouse any periodic payments\r\n             of alimony and the circumstances of the parties or the\r\n             financial ability of the spouse making the periodic\r\n             payments shall have changed since the rendition of such\r\n             judgment, either party may apply to the court which\r\n             rendered the judgment for an order and judgment\r\n             decreasing or increasing the amount of such alimony\r\n             payments or terminating such payments and the court,\r\n             after giving both parties an opportunity to be heard and to\r\n             introduce evidence relevant to the issue, shall make such\r\n             order and judgment as justice and equity shall require,\r\n             with due regard to the changed circumstances and the\r\n             financial ability of the supporting spouse, decreasing or\r\n             increasing or confirming the amount of alimony provided\r\n             for in such original judgment or terminating such\r\n             payments.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-170 (1985). Changes in circumstances must be substantial\r\nor material to justify modification or termination of an alimony award. Miles, 355\r\nS.C. at 519, 586 S.E.2d at 140. Moreover, the change in circumstances must be\r\nunanticipated. Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 589, 594 S.E.2d 171, 174 (Ct. App.\r\n2004). \"The party seeking modification has the burden to show by a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the unforeseen change has occurred.\" Kelley v.\r\nKelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\n\"Many of the same considerations relevant to the initial setting of an alimony\r\naward may be applied in the modification context as well, including the parties'\r\nstandard of living during the marriage, each party's earning capacity, and the\r\nsupporting spouse's ability to continue to support the other spouse.\" Miles, 355\r\nS.C. at 519, 586 S.E.2d at 140. Per statute, the complete list of factors the family\r\ncourt can consider in setting alimony includes: (1) duration of the marriage; (2)\r\nphysical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the\r\nparties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of\r\nliving established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated\r\nearnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs\r\nof the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of\r\nchildren; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior\r\nsupport obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nHere, the family court found Husband's child support and alimony payments\r\nconstituted 16.7% of his gross income excluding bonuses in 2007, and Husband's\r\nalimony payment constituted 19.6% of his gross income excluding bonuses in\r\n2011. The family court determined this increase in the amount of support\r\ncompared to Husband's gross income was not substantial, and therefore, Husband\r\nshould be required to pay Wife $600 per month. We find the family court erred in\r\ncalculating alimony by failing to consider the relevant statutory factors. The\r\nfamily court failed to consider the parties' relevant circumstances, including, but\r\nnot limited to, their expenses, Husband's financial ability and earning capacity, and\r\nwhether Husband's change in circumstances was unanticipated. The family court\r\nfocused only on the percentage of Husband's income constituting alimony.\r\n\r\nWe find, based upon a consideration of the statutory alimony factors, Husband has\r\ndemonstrated an unanticipated substantial change in circumstances that justifies a\r\nreduction in his alimony payment. After being laid off and finding other\r\nemployment, Husband's annual income decreased from $88,500 to $41,016. In\r\naddition, according to his 2011 financial declaration, Husband's monthly expenses\r\ntotaled $4,078.79 while his gross monthly income was $3,418. At the family court\r\nhearing, Husband testified that even after the court reduced his alimony obligation\r\nto $150 in its temporary order, it was still a \"strain\" to meet his expenses.\r\nAlthough normal decreases in income may not be enough to warrant a decrease in\r\nalimony, here, Husband's change in financial situation is material enough to\r\n\nwarrant a decrease in his alimony obligation, especially considering Husband is\r\nmaking less than half of his income from 2007. We note that while Husband's\r\nfinancial situation has worsened since 2007, Wife's financial situation has\r\nimproved. Pursuant to her 2011 financial declaration, Wife's annual income\r\nincreased from $34,000 to $42,096. Additionally, Wife's monthly expenses totaled\r\n$4,629, and she saved $866 per month. The purpose of alimony is to place the\r\nsupported spouse, to the extent possible, in the position she enjoyed during the\r\nmarriage, and the record contains no evidence that Wife was saving over $800 per\r\nmonth during the parties' marriage. See Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424\r\n(holding the purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, to the extent\r\npossible, in the position she enjoyed during the marriage). In that regard, we find\r\nHusband should not have to exhaust his resources so Wife can save $866 per\r\nmonth. See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App.\r\n1988) (\"Alimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the\r\nmarital relationship.\"); see Butler v. Butler, 385 S.C. 328, 340, 684 S.E.2d 191,\r\n197 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding the family court did not err in considering Wife's\r\nexpenses in calculating Husband's alimony obligation where Wife testified as to\r\nthe parties' history of spending during their marriage).\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of the facts of this case along with the statutory\r\nalimony factors, we find Husband is entitled to a reduction in his alimony payment\r\nfrom $600 per month plus 20% of his annual bonus to $275 per month.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe affirm the family court's order requiring Husband pay Wife alimony and\r\nremoving the 20% bonus provision. However, we find Husband is entitled to a\r\nreduction in his alimony payment from $600 per month as ordered by the family\r\ncourt to $275 per month.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5024","title":"DiMarco v.

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nFather and Mother were divorced in September 1998. Following their divorce,\r\nMother retained custody of the parties' four children and Father was ordered to pay\r\nchild support. In January 2003, Father filed a motion seeking, among other relief,\r\na modification of the parties' child support agreement. In March 2004, the family\r\ncourt approved an agreement reached by the parties. The parties agreed child\r\nsupport would be based on Father's gross income of $8,333 per month and\r\nMother's gross income of $2,500 per month. Father agreed to pay $1,439 per\r\nmonth in child support for the parties' three minor children.1\r\n\r\nIn August 2006, the family court held a temporary hearing after Mother filed a\r\nmotion requesting discovery, an increase in child support, and attorney's fees. In a\r\ntemporary order, the family court noted Father's income was highly contested and\r\nit \"could not make any type of merits hearing or determinative analysis on a\r\nMotion basis.\" The family court, relying on the financial affidavits and\r\ndeclarations of the parties, found Father's income was $4,733.40 per month and\r\nMother's income was $2,500 per month. The family court set child support for the\r\nparties' remaining two minor children at $835 per month. The family court also\r\nheld the issue of attorney's fees in abeyance pending a final hearing on the merits\r\nand ordered Father to advance Mother $7,000 for the cost of discovery.\r\n\r\nOn March 11-12, 2008, a trial was held before the family court. In an April 21,\r\n2008 order, the family court determined an increase in Father's income, and a\r\nchange from three to two minor children requiring support, necessitated a child\r\nsupport recalculation. The family court determined Father's income was $10,255\r\nper month and Mother's income was $3,416 per month. In calculating Father's\r\nannual income, the family court included $11,263 per year in rental income and an\r\naverage capital gain of $7,133 per year. The family court ordered Father to pay\r\n$1,226 per month in child support, and awarded Mother $25,000 in attorney's\r\nfees.2 Thereafter, Father filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the\r\njudgment, requesting the court reconsider its finding as to Mother's income. In a\r\nJune 23, 2008 supplemental order, the family court determined Mother's gross\r\nincome was $4,293 per month. The family court recalculated Father's child\r\nsupport obligation and ordered he pay $1,216 per month. The family court denied\r\n\r\n1 At the time of their agreement, the parties' oldest child was emancipated and \n\r\nattending college.\n\r\n2 In support of her request for attorney's fees, Mother submitted an affidavit from\n\r\nher attorney showing she incurred $33,910.37 in attorney's fees and costs. \n\r\n\nFather's request to reconsider its inclusion of rental income and capital gains in its\r\ncalculation of his income. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The family court is a court of equity.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709\r\nS.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). In appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\nreviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414,\r\n709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). \"De novo review permits appellate court fact-finding,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of evidence supporting the trial court's findings.\"\r\nLewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55. However, this broad standard of\r\nreview does not require the appellate court to disregard the factual findings of the\r\ntrial court or ignore the fact that the trial court is in the better position to assess the\r\ncredibility of the witnesses. Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d\r\n620, 623 (2001). Moreover, the appellant is not relieved of the burden of\r\ndemonstrating error in the trial court's findings of fact. Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d at\r\n623. Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the trial court in an equity case\r\nunless its decision is controlled by some error of law or the appellant satisfies the\r\nburden of showing the preponderance of the evidence actually supports contrary\r\nfactual findings by this court. See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.     Rental Income\r\n\r\nFather argues the family court erred in calculating his rental income for child\r\nsupport purposes. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines) \"define income as the actual gross\r\nincome of the parent, if employed to full capacity, or potential income if\r\nunemployed or underemployed.\" S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(1) (Supp.\r\n2011). \"Gross income includes income from any source including salaries, wages,\r\ncommissions, royalties, bonuses, rents (less allowable business expenses),\r\ndividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, capital gains,\r\nSocial Security benefits . . . , workers' compensation benefits, unemployment\r\ninsurance benefits, Veterans' benefits and alimony . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n114-4720(A)(2) (Supp. 2011). \"Ordinarily, the court will determine income from\r\nverified financial declarations required by the Family Court rules. However, . . .\r\nwhere the amounts reflected on the financial declaration may be an issue, the court\r\n\nmay rely on suitable documentation of current earnings . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\nRegs. 114-4720(A)(6) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the family court, Father's accountant testified the rental\r\nproperties were operating at a loss. Father testified that high interest rates,\r\nevictions, and trouble finding tenants with decent credit contributed to the losses\r\non the rental properties. Father also testified as to the specific expenses spent for\r\nmaintaining the rental property of 6 Grey Leaf Court. Father explained that all the\r\nexpenses were represented in the 2006 tax return and that he had receipts to\r\nsupport the tax returns. Father asked the court if he should go through the\r\nexpenses for each rental property, and the court responded that if the expenses\r\nwere included in the 2006 tax return, there was no need to go through the expenses.\r\nFather's 2006 tax return included all the expenses for each rental property and\r\nrepresented that the rental properties were operating at a loss.\r\n\r\nIn calculating Father's income for child support purposes, the family court found\r\nFather earned $11,263 per year in net rental income, which constituted his gross\r\nrental income less mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance. While the court did not\r\nspecifically state in its order that it relied on the rental income amounts listed in\r\nFather's 2006 tax returns in making its determination, it appears the court arrived at\r\n$11,263 per year in rental income by subtracting mortgage interest, taxes, and\r\ninsurance from the gross rental income listed on Father's 2006 tax returns.3 The\r\nfamily court did not deduct the ordinary and necessary expenses of the rental\r\nproperties referenced in Father's tax returns. Specifically, the family court did not\r\ndeduct expenses for cleaning and maintenance, legal fees, supplies, and association\r\ndues.\r\n\r\nWe find Father should be given the opportunity to present evidence of the expenses\r\nrelated to his rental income for the court's consideration. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nthe family court's calculation of Father's rental income and remand for a\r\nrecalculation. 4\r\n\r\n3 Pursuant to Father's 2006 tax returns, he received $66,315 in gross rental income.\r\nLess mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance, Father received $11,264 in rental\r\nincome. This is a one dollar difference from the family court's finding of $11,263\r\nin net rental income.\r\n4 We note Father also argues the family court erred in relying on his 2005 loan\r\napplication in calculating his rental income. We disagree. In its order, the family\r\ncourt specifically stated it chose not to rely on the amounts listed on the loan\r\napplication.\r\n\n    II.    Wife's Rental Income\r\n\r\nFather argues the family court erred in failing to exclude his current wife's (Wife)\r\nrental income from its calculation of his income. We decline to address this\r\nargument on the merits. In his brief, Father failed to cite any case law or authority\r\nto support his argument, and therefore, we find it is abandoned on appeal. See\r\nFirst Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994)\r\n(finding an issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the\r\nargument is raised in a brief but is not supported by authority); Shealy v. Doe, 370\r\nS.C. 194, 205-06, 634 S.E.2d 45, 51 (Ct. App. 2006) (declining to address an issue\r\non appeal when appellant failed to cite any supporting authority and made\r\nconclusory arguments).\r\n\r\n    III.   Capital Gains\r\n\r\nFather argues the family court erred in including capital gains in its income\r\ncalculation. This argument is not preserved for our review. Relying on Father and\r\nWife's joint 2004, 2005, and 2006 tax returns, the family court determined Father\r\nreceived an average capital gain of $7,133 per year.5 In his rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\nmotion, Father argued the family court erred in including Wife's capital gains in its\r\ncalculation of his income. Father also argued the court erred in failing to consider\r\nhis investment losses. On appeal, Father contends the family court erred in\r\nincluding any capital gains in its income calculation. Father argues a capital gain\r\nis a \"one-time event\" and should not be considered for child support purposes.\r\nBecause Father failed to raise this argument to the family court, it is not preserved.\r\nSee King v. King, 384 S.C. 134, 142, 681 S.E.2d 609, 614 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding\r\nissues must be raised to and ruled upon by the family court to be preserved for\r\nappellate review).\r\n\r\n    IV.    Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nFather argues the family court erred in awarding Mother excessive attorney's fees.\r\nGiven our disposition of Father's first issue on appeal, we remand to the family\r\ncourt for reconsideration of attorney's fees. See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501,\r\n503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993) (where the substantive results achieved by\r\n\r\n\r\n5Pursuant to the Father's tax returns, he received $11,821 in capital gains in 2004,\r\n$11,344 in capital gains in 2005, and $8,144 in capital gains in 2006.\r\n\ncounsel were reversed on appeal, the issue of attorney's fees was remanded for\r\nreconsideration).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5025","title":"State v.

We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n                   FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       Sometime between 9 p.m. April 25, 2009, and 3 a.m. April 26, 2009,\r\nofficers with the Greenwood Police Department conducted a license\r\ncheckpoint at the intersection of New Market Street and Milwee Avenue in\r\nGreenwood, South Carolina. During that checkpoint, while detaining Randy\r\nJason Vickery for suspicion of driving under the influence, officers spotted\r\nmethamphetamines and drug paraphernalia in his vehicle and arrested him.\r\nThat same night, the Greenwood Police Department conducted three other\r\ncheckpoints in the same vicinity from 9 p.m. until 3 a.m. The four\r\ncheckpoints produced a total of fifty-six violations, including forty-eight\r\ntraffic cases and eight criminal cases.\r\n\r\n       Vickery was indicted for possession of methamphetamine with intent to\r\ndistribute and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute within\r\nproximity of a school. At trial, Vickery made a motion to suppress the\r\nevidence discovered as a result of the stop, challenging the stop's\r\nconstitutionality, arguing it violated the Fourth Amendment. The State\r\npresented the testimony of Officer Robbie Byrd. Officer Byrd testified he\r\nwas employed by the Greenwood Police Department in the traffic unit. He\r\nstated that on the night of April 25, 2009, through the morning of April 26, he\r\nconducted traffic safety checkpoints. He testified that checkpoint locations\r\nwere determined based on \"traffic flow, speeding complaints, loud music\r\ncomplaints, anything such as that nature, primarily just involving traffic.\" He\r\nindicated that the checkpoint locations were selected by Lieutenant Jennifer\r\nBass, who was over the traffic unit, and Major James Marshall. He stated\r\nthat they had contact with the citizens who were complaining about speeding\r\nand loud music coming from cars. Officer Byrd stated the primary purpose\r\nof the checkpoints was to check for traffic safety, such as child restraints,\r\nseatbelts, driver's licenses, vehicle tags, and the proper credentials. He\r\ntestified the officers would stop each car that came through the checkpoint\r\nand check each driver's license. He further testified the four checkpoints that\r\n\nnight resulted in forty-eight traffic cases and two drug cases. He testified the\r\nstops that produced no violations lasted no longer than a minute.\r\n\r\n       Following Officer Byrd's testimony, Vickery argued the State had not\r\nlaid the proper foundation to establish the checkpoint's constitutionality under\r\nBrown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979), and Michigan Department of State\r\nPolice v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990). He argued State v. Groome, 378 S.C.\r\n615, 664 S.E.2d 460 (2008), was \"adamant\" the State must present empirical\r\ndata gathered prior to the checkpoint to justify setting up the checkpoint. He\r\nmaintained the State only provided empirical data on the \"back side, what the\r\nresults were, but they have produced nothing to indicate why the Greenwood\r\nPolice Department wanted to set up a checkpoint here.\" He asserted the State\r\nneeded to provide information as to how many tickets were written and\r\npeople had been arrested on the road in the month or year prior to the\r\ncheckpoint. He stated those who established the checkpoints needed to\r\ntestify and supply the empirical data.\r\n\r\n      The State responded and agreed Sitz, while critical of the searching\r\nexamination of effectiveness by trial courts, \"retains the requirement that the\r\nState produce empirical data to support the roadblock.\" It argued the report\r\nmarked Court Exhibit Number 1 established how the checkpoint was\r\neffective and what the results were. Vickery argued that report \"would\r\nprobably be very good empirical data for the next checkpoint that they want\r\nto have at this location.\" He asserted that the State was arguing that if it set\r\nup a checkpoint and arrested forty-eight people, then it was a good\r\ncheckpoint. Vickery argued, \"It's data on the front side [that case law\r\nrequires], not on the back side.\"\r\n\r\n      Before adjourning for lunch, the trial court stated it was going to take\r\nthe matter under advisement and would leave the record open if the State\r\nwished to see if the file contained any additional empirical data. Following\r\nthe break, the State called Major Urban Mitchell to testify. He stated he was\r\nin charge of the administration division of the Greenwood Police Department.\r\nHe stated that the position involved records, training, evidence, and crime\r\nscenes and included gathering statistics. The State introduced, for the\r\npurposes of the hearing, several traffic enforcement activity reports that\r\nincluded the intersection of New Market and Milwee or an intersection\r\n\nlocated two blocks away. Major Mitchell testified that the police department\r\nhad determined that conducting traffic safety checkpoints was an effective\r\nway to manage traffic problems. On cross-examination, Major Mitchell\r\ncould not say how many of the fifty-six violations on April 26 occurred at the\r\nintersection of New Market and Milwee but admitted fifty-six tickets at the\r\npolice headquarters could be obtained to show which of the incidents\r\noccurred at that intersection.\r\n\r\n      The trial court found the State presented\r\n\r\n            insufficient empirical data justifying the authorization\r\n            and implementation of the roadblock in question . . . .\r\n            Except for the traffic testimony offered by Major\r\n            Mitchell, no testimony was offered by the State about\r\n            the number of tickets, wrecks, and/or citizen\r\n            complaints related to traffic concerns at the\r\n            intersection of New Market Street and Milwee\r\n            Avenue prior to the roadblock in question.\r\n            Testimony by the State's witnesses indicates that the\r\n            Greenwood Police Department relied on general\r\n            knowledge of the neighborhood to justify the\r\n            roadblock in question.\r\n\r\nThe trial court further found:\r\n\r\n            [T]he Traffic Enforcement Activity Reports contain\r\n            some empirical data regarding the intersection of\r\n            New Market Street and Milwee Avenue, but the data\r\n            presented is insufficient to constitutionally justify the\r\n            roadblock on April 25, 2009, at which [Vickery] was\r\n            stopped and arrested. The record is absent of any\r\n            specific evidence for the Court to determine the\r\n            number of cases which resulted from the roadblock in\r\n            question. Furthermore, the evidence in the record is\r\n            insufficient for the Court to determine the\r\n            effectiveness of the roadblock in question. No\r\n\n            testimony was presented about how many vehicles\r\n            passed through the roadblock in question.\r\n\r\nThe court determined the roadblock \"did not violate [Vickery's] Fourth\r\nAmendment rights because its primary purpose was traffic safety\r\nenforcement.\" However, the court found the roadblock did violate his Fourth\r\nAmendment rights because\r\n\r\n            the State provided insufficient empirical data to\r\n            support the effectiveness of the roadblock in\r\n            question. Without sufficient empirical data to justify\r\n            the implementation of the roadblock and without\r\n            sufficient data derived from conducting this\r\n            roadblock, the Court is unable to do the necessary\r\n            comparison analysis to determine the effectiveness of\r\n            this roadblock as required under Brown v. Texas, 443\r\n            U.S. 47 (1979).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court granted Vickery's motion to suppress and\r\nsuppressed all drugs and drug paraphernalia located in Vickery's vehicle and\r\non his person, as well as all statements made, observations of his behavior,\r\nand recordings. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      \"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\"\r\nState v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Thus, an\r\nappellate court is bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are\r\nclearly erroneous. Id. The South Carolina Supreme Court has articulated the\r\nstandard of review to apply to Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases.\r\nState v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000). The court\r\nhas specifically rejected the de novo standard the United States Supreme\r\nCourt set forth in Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996), for\r\nreviewing determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause in the\r\ncontext of warrantless searches and seizures. State v. Williams, 351 S.C.\r\n591, 597, 571 S.E.2d 703, 706 (Ct. App. 2002). The Brockman court\r\ndetermined the trial court's ruling would be reviewed like any other factual\r\n\nfinding: reversed if there is clear error and affirmed if any evidence supports\r\nthe ruling. 339 S.C. at 66, 528 S.E.2d at 666.\r\n\r\n            On appeals from a motion to suppress based on\r\n            Fourth Amendment grounds, this Court applies a\r\n            deferential standard of review and will reverse if\r\n            there is clear error. However, this deference does not\r\n            bar this Court from conducting its own review of the\r\n            record to determine whether the trial judge's decision\r\n            is supported by the evidence.\r\n\r\nState v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 521, 698 S.E.2d 203, 205 (2010) (citation\r\nomitted). Under the clear error standard, \"an appellate court will not reverse\r\na trial court's finding of fact simply because it would have decided the case\r\ndifferently.\" State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 96, 623 S.E.2d 840, 846 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005). Rather, the appellate court must determine whether, based on\r\nthe evidence, it is left with the definite and firm conviction the trial court\r\ncommitted a mistake. Id. Accordingly, we will apply an any evidence\r\nstandard to the trial court's ruling. Williams, 351 S.C. at 597, 571 S.E.2d at\r\n707.                         LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      The State contends the trial court erred in suppressing the stop by\r\nfinding the State failed to produce sufficient empirical data to justify the\r\neffectiveness of the checkpoint. We agree.\r\n\r\n      The Fourth Amendment guarantees a person the right to be secure from\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend IV; State v. Butler,\r\n343 S.C. 198, 201, 539 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 2000). \"[T]he Fourth\r\nAmendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, including\r\nseizures that involve only a brief detention.\" State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84,\r\n97, 623 S.E.2d 840, 847 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing United States v. Mendenhall,\r\n446 U.S. 544 (1980)). \"[S]topping a vehicle at a checkpoint constitutes a\r\nseizure of a person within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\"\r\nUnited States v. Brugal, 209 F.3d 353, 356 (4th Cir. 2000) (citing Mich.\r\n\nDep't of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 450 (1990); United States v.\r\nMartinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 556 (1976)).\r\n\r\n            Constitutional challenges to checkpoint seizures turn\r\n            on whether the initial stop at the checkpoint was\r\n            reasonable. . . . Whether particular checkpoint\r\n            seizures are reasonable is determined by balancing\r\n            the gravity of the public interest sought to be\r\n            advanced and the degree to which the seizures do\r\n            advance that interest against the extent of the\r\n            resulting intrusion upon the liberty interests of those\r\n            stopped.\r\n\r\nId. (citing Sitz, 496 U.S. at 449-55).\r\n\r\n       The United States Supreme Court has applied this balancing analysis\r\nand \"upheld the constitutionality of government checkpoints set up to detect\r\ndrunken drivers, see [Sitz, 496 U.S. at 454], and illegal immigrants, see\r\nMartinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 556–67 . . . , so long as they involve no more\r\nthan an 'initial stop . . . and the associated preliminary questioning and\r\nobservation by checkpoint officers.'\" Id. at 356-57 (quoting Sitz, 496 U.S. at\r\n450-51) (second ellipses added by court). \"The seizure at the sobriety\r\ncheckpoint upheld in Sitz lasted approximately twenty-five seconds, and the\r\nseizures at the immigration checkpoint upheld in Martinez-Fuerte lasted three\r\nto five minutes.\" Id. at 357 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n      \"The [United States] Supreme Court has also recognized that a state has\r\na substantial interest in enforcing licensing and registration laws, though that\r\ninterest is not substantial enough to justify roving patrol stops as an\r\nenforcement mechanism.\" Id. (citing Prouse, 440 U.S. at 658-59). However,\r\nthe Court suggested in Prouse, \"checkpoints to check driver's licenses would\r\nbe permissible even in the absence of articulable and reasonable suspicion\r\nthat a driver was unlicensed.\" Id. (citing Prouse, 440 U.S. at 663; Texas v.\r\nBrown, 460 U.S. 730, 743 (1983) (plurality opinion) (noting that the\r\ncircumstances surrounding stop at driver's license roadblock gave \"no\r\nsuggestion that the roadblock was a pretext whereby evidence of a narcotics\r\n\nviolation might be uncovered in 'plain view' in the course of a check for\r\ndriver's licenses\")).\r\n\r\n            Drawing on these authorities, courts have concluded\r\n            that a brief stop at a checkpoint for the limited\r\n            purpose of verifying a driver's license, vehicle\r\n            registration, and proof of insurance is a reasonable\r\n            intrusion into the lives of motorists and their\r\n            passengers even in the absence of reasonable\r\n            suspicion that a motorist or passenger is engaged in\r\n            illegal activity.\r\n\r\nId. (citing United States v. Galindo-Gonzales, 142 F.3d 1217, 1221 (10th Cir.\r\n1998) (finding brief detention of motorist to inspect driver's license, vehicle\r\nregistration, and insurance information at an established license checkpoint\r\ncomports with the Fourth Amendment); United States v. McFayden, 865 F.2d\r\n1306, 1310-13 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (finding a roadblock to inspect drivers'\r\nlicenses and vehicle registrations met the Fourth Amendment standard of\r\nreasonableness)).\r\n\r\n            [T]he Court has determined that the gravity of the\r\n            public interests that such stops seek to advance and\r\n            the general efficacy of checkpoint stops in advancing\r\n            those interests outweigh the minimal intrusions on\r\n            protected Fourth Amendment liberty interests that are\r\n            caused by the brief stops required for such limited\r\n            questioning and observation. But, the Court has also\r\n            cautioned that \"[d]etention of particular motorists for\r\n            more extensive . . . testing may require satisfaction of\r\n            an individualized suspicion standard.\"\r\n\r\nNorwood v. Bain, 143 F.3d 843, 848 (4th Cir. 1998) (ellipsis and last set of\r\nbrackets by court) (quoting Sitz, 496 U.S. at 451), vacated, aff'd this ground\r\non reh'g en banc, 166 F.3d 243, 245 (4th Cir. 1999). \"[A] claim that a\r\nparticular exercise of discretion in locating or operating a checkpoint is\r\nunreasonable is subject to post-stop judicial review.\" Martinez-Fuerte, 428\r\nU.S. at 559.\r\n\n       In State v. Groome, 378 S.C. 615, 619, 664 S.E.2d 460, 462 (2008), the\r\ntrial court found a roadblock violated the Fourth Amendment under Brown v.\r\nTexas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979). The Groome court noted \"Brown established a\r\nthree part balancing test for determining the constitutionality of a traffic\r\ncheckpoint: 1) the gravity of the public interest served by the seizure; 2) the\r\ndegree to which the seizure serves the public interest; and, 3) the severity of\r\nthe interference with individual liberty.\" Id. at 619, 664 S.E.2d at 462. The\r\ntrial court held the first and third factors easily weighed in the State's favor\r\nbut found the State presented no evidence on the second factor. Id.\r\n\r\n      On appeal, the State argued the trial court abused its discretion in\r\nfinding the State failed to meet the second Brown factor, the \"effectiveness\"\r\nrequirement. Id.\r\n\r\n            The State argues that it need not introduce evidence\r\n            about the specific effectiveness of this roadblock\r\n            because, by its very nature, every license check\r\n            roadblock determines whether the driver is legally\r\n            licensed. The State's position that license check\r\n            roadblocks are ipso facto constitutional, thereby\r\n            eliminating the requirement of effectiveness from the\r\n            Brown formula relies upon [Sitz]. While Sitz does\r\n            criticize \"searching examination of effectiveness\" by\r\n            trial courts, it retains the requirement that the State\r\n            produce empirical data to support the effectiveness of\r\n            its roadblock. Sitz, [496 U.S.] at 454 (\"unlike\r\n            [Prouse], this case [does not involve] a complete\r\n            absence of empirical data. . . .\"). The record supports\r\n            the trial court's finding that the State failed to produce\r\n            any evidence satisfying the second prong of the\r\n            Brown test.\r\n\r\nGroome, 378 S.C. at 619-20, 664 S.E.2d at 462 (ellipsis and last set of\r\nbrackets added by court).\r\n\n       In Sitz, 496 U.S. at 453, the Michigan Court of Appeals \"consider[ed]\r\nas part of the balancing analysis the 'effectiveness' of the proposed\r\ncheckpoint program.\" The United States Supreme Court found the court of\r\nappeals erred in concluding the checkpoint program failed the effectiveness\r\npart of the test and the failure materially discounted the State's strong interest\r\nin implementing the program. Id. The court noted, \"The actual language\r\nfrom Brown v. Texas, upon which the Michigan courts based their evaluation\r\nof 'effectiveness,' describes the balancing factor as 'the degree to which the\r\nseizure advances the public interest.'\" Id. (quoting Brown, 443 U.S. at 51).\r\n\"This passage from Brown was not meant to transfer from politically\r\naccountable officials to the courts the decision as to which among reasonable\r\nalternative law enforcement techniques should be employed to deal with a\r\nserious public danger.\" Id. \"But for purposes of Fourth Amendment\r\nanalysis, the choice among such reasonable alternatives remains with the\r\ngovernmental officials who have a unique understanding of, and a\r\nresponsibility for, limited public resources, including a finite number of\r\npolice officers.\" Id. at 453-54. \"Brown's rather general reference to 'the\r\ndegree to which the seizure advances the public interest' was derived, as the\r\nopinion makes clear, from the line of cases culminating in Martinez-Fuerte, .\r\n. . . Neither Martinez-Fuerte nor [Prouse], however, the two cases cited by\r\nthe Court of Appeals as providing the basis for its 'effectiveness' review, . . .\r\nsupports the searching examination of 'effectiveness' undertaken by the\r\nMichigan court.\" Id. at 454.\r\n\r\n      The Sitz court further noted:\r\n\r\n            In Delaware v. Prouse, we disapproved random stops\r\n            made by Delaware Highway Patrol officers in an\r\n            effort to apprehend unlicensed drivers and unsafe\r\n            vehicles. We observed that no empirical evidence\r\n            indicated that such stops would be an effective means\r\n            of promoting roadway safety and said that \"[i]t seems\r\n            common sense that the percentage of all drivers on\r\n            the road who are driving without a license is very\r\n            small and that the number of licensed drivers who\r\n            will be stopped in order to find one unlicensed\r\n            operator will be large indeed.\"\r\n\nId. (quoting Prouse, 440 U.S. at 659-60) (alteration by court). The court\r\n\"observed that the random stops involved the 'kind of standardless and\r\nunconstrained discretion [which] is the evil the Court has discerned when in\r\nprevious cases it has insisted that the discretion of the official in the field be\r\ncircumscribed, at least to some extent.'\" Id. (quoting Prouse, 440 U.S. at 661)\r\n(alteration by court).\r\n\r\n      The Sitz court found that \"[u]nlike Prouse, this case involves neither a\r\ncomplete absence of empirical data nor a challenge to random highway\r\nstops.\" Id. During the operation of the Saginaw County\r\n            checkpoint, the detention of the 126 vehicles that\r\n            entered the checkpoint resulted in the arrest of two\r\n            drunken drivers. Stated as a percentage,\r\n            approximately 1.6 percent of the drivers passing\r\n            through the checkpoint were arrested for alcohol\r\n            impairment. In addition, an expert witness testified at\r\n            the trial that experience in other States demonstrated\r\n            that, on the whole, sobriety checkpoints resulted in\r\n            drunken driving arrests of around 1 percent of all\r\n            motorists stopped. By way of comparison, the record\r\n            from one of the consolidated cases in Martinez-\r\n            Fuerte showed that in the associated checkpoint,\r\n            illegal aliens were found in only 0.12 percent of the\r\n            vehicles passing through the checkpoint. The ratio of\r\n            illegal aliens detected to vehicles stopped\r\n            (considering that on occasion two or more illegal\r\n            aliens were found in a single vehicle) was\r\n            approximately 0.5 percent. We concluded that this\r\n            \"record . . . provides a rather complete picture of the\r\n            effectiveness of the San Clemente checkpoint,\" and\r\n            we sustained its constitutionality. We see no\r\n            justification for a different conclusion here.\r\n\nId. at 454-55 (alteration by court) (citations omitted). The court determined\r\n\"the balance of the State's interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to\r\nwhich this system can reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the\r\ndegree of intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs\r\nin favor of the state program\" and found it consistent with the Fourth\r\nAmendment. Id. at 455.\r\n\r\n      In State v. Larson, 485 N.W.2d 571, 573 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992), the\r\nMinnesota Court of Appeals found \"the state failed to present any evidence of\r\nthe effectiveness of the checkpoint.\" (citing Brown, 443 U.S. at 51 (holding\r\nthe court must balance \"the degree to which the seizure advances the public\r\ninterest\"); Prouse, 440 U.S. at 659-60 (finding the State presented no\r\nempirical evidence that random driver's license checks were effective)). It\r\nnoted, \"Here, there was no testimony on how many driver's license or\r\nequipment violations were uncovered or other empirical data on the\r\neffectiveness of the checkpoint in advancing the public interest.\" Id.\r\n(emphasis added) (citing Chock v. Comm'r of Pub. Safety, 458 N.W.2d 692,\r\n694 (Minn. Ct. App. 1990) (approving legality of sobriety checkpoint on\r\nwhich empirical data of effectiveness was presented)).\r\n\r\n       Vickery argued and the trial court found the State presented no\r\nevidence of empirical evidence that led to the determination of the location of\r\nthe checkpoint.1 However, the cases on point do not require the State to\r\npresent pre-existing empirical data to justify setting up the checkpoint. The\r\ncase law does require some basis for the location of the checkpoint. Here,\r\nOfficer Byrd testified the checkpoint was placed in that location due to\r\ncitizen complaints about speeding and loud music. Major Mitchell also\r\ntestified he had personal knowledge of the problems at the intersection before\r\nthe checkpoint was set up from seeing incident reports, traffic tickets, and\r\nstatistics. Additionally, the Traffic Enforcement Activity Reports for dates\r\nprior to April 26 show that license checkpoints in the same area resulted in\r\nthirty to sixty traffic and criminal offenses on each occasion. Therefore, the\r\n\r\n1The State also had the burden of showing the purpose of the stop and that it\r\nserved the public interest. The checkpoint was not established by the officers\r\nconducting it but rather by their supervisors. Also, this was not a roving stop.\r\nNone of these factors are at issue in this case.\r\n\ntrial court committed an error of law in requiring the State to present\r\nempirical data to justify the authorization and implementation of the\r\ncheckpoint.\r\n\r\n       The trial court also suppressed the search because the State's empirical\r\ndata regarding the effectiveness of the checkpoint was insufficient. The trial\r\ncourt acknowledged the State presented some empirical data regarding the\r\nintersection, but that it was insufficient to justify the roadblock. Prouse,\r\nGroome, and Sitz all require some empirical data that supports the second\r\nprong of Brown, that the seizure serves the public interest. However, none of\r\nthese cases state how much evidence is considered enough. The United\r\nStates Supreme Court, as well as our own supreme court, has stressed that no\r\nevidence is not enough. Here, we do have some evidence, lying somewhere\r\nbetween Prouse and Sitz. The two facts that seem to be lacking to paint the\r\nentire picture are how many vehicles came through this stop or all of the\r\nstops and how many of the tickets were specific to this stop location.\r\nAccording to Groome, the question before us is whether the record supports\r\nthe trial court's finding that the State's empirical data was insufficient to\r\nsatisfy the second prong of Brown. By showing the stops resulted in a total\r\nof forty-eight traffic violations and eight criminal cases including two drug\r\narrests, the State met its burden under the second prong of Brown and the\r\ntrial court erred in determining the State had to put up more evidence to show\r\nthe checkpoint's effectiveness.\r\n\r\n       The purpose of the empirical data on the effectiveness is to be able to\r\nbalance the effectiveness of the checkpoint with the other two prongs set\r\nforth in Brown, (1) the gravity of the public interest served by the seizure and\r\n(3) the severity of the interference with individual liberty. Here, the point of\r\nthe checkpoint was to prevent traffic offenses and people driving without a\r\nlicense. This serves the public interest in that traffic violations and people\r\ndriving without a license can cause injury to others. The severity with\r\nindividual liberty was low in that the stops were marked so drivers could\r\nanticipate it and each stop lasted under a minute, if there was no violation.\r\nWeighing those two factors with the data provided as to the second factor,\r\neffectiveness, the license checkpoint did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision is\r\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5026","title":"State v.

In the\r\nalternative, Lee contends this case should be reversed and remanded because of\r\ncumulative error resulting in prejudice to him and a denial of his right to a fair trial.\r\nWe reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nLee was indicted in Darlington County in 2009 on charges of criminal sexual\r\nconduct (CSC) with a minor under the age of eleven years, committing or\r\nattempting to commit a lewd act upon a child under the age of sixteen years, and\r\ntwo counts of unlawful conduct toward a child. Buie, the mother of Victim, was\r\nalso charged with two counts of unlawful conduct toward a child.\r\n\r\nLee's charges stem from allegations by Victim, first reported to law enforcement\r\non November 12, 2007. Victim lived in the home of Lee, with Buie, her younger\r\nbrother, and Lee, until July 7, 2007, when she left to live with her father. Victim\r\nalleged that while she was living in Lee's home, Lee touched her \"lower private\r\npart\" and penetrated her with his finger and made her touch his \"lower private\" as\r\nwell. Victim also alleged she saw Lee and Buie engage in sexual activity with\r\neach other and with other individuals, and observed both Buie and Lee engage in\r\ndrug activity in the home. Further, she alleged she watched pornographic material\r\non television with Lee.\r\n\r\nArrest warrants were issued for Buie and Lee on January 23, 2008, and the U.S.\r\nMarshals' (Marshals) services were employed on January 26. At the pre-trial\r\nhearing, Stuart Cottingham, a member of the Marshals, testified Lee was found in\r\nSumter, South Carolina, on February 6, 2008. The Marshals located Buie in\r\nClarendon County living in a camper.\r\n\r\nLee and Buie were tried by a jury the week of October 25, 2009. During the trial,\r\nthe State proffered twenty-five graphic images recovered from a digital camera.\r\nHowever, they requested that only two of the photographs, Exhibits 149 and 150,\r\nbe published to the jury. The two photographs were taken on February 6, 2008, in\r\nthe camper where Marshals located Buie. The State argued the photographs\r\nportrayed an ongoing course of conduct directly related to Victim's testimony of\r\n\nevents as alleged in the indictment, which states Lee participated in sexual activity\r\nin the presence of Victim. Lee argued the conduct depicted in the photographs was\r\nnot relevant on any issue regarding the children or the elements of the indictment.\r\nFurther, he maintained the evidence was unduly prejudicial. The trial court\r\nadmitted the two photographs over his objection, stating it found the evidence\r\nprobative because it corroborated the testimony of the Victim as to what events\r\nwere occurring in the home. Further, the trial court found the State lessened the\r\nprejudicial effect of all the digital camera's contents by selecting only two\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nLee was found guilty of all four charges and sentenced to concurrent terms of\r\nthirty years for the CSC offense, fifteen years for the lewd act offense, and ten\r\nyears each for the unlawful conduct offenses. Lee moved for a new trial based on\r\nmultiple alleged evidentiary issues, and the trial court denied his motion.

We find the trial court erred in\r\nthe admission of the challenged photographs because of their unduly prejudicial\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nRule 403, SCRE states that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\r\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\r\ndelay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" A trial\r\ncourt has particularly wide discretion in ruling on Rule 403 objections.

Lee's subsequent conduct is not necessarily indicative of\r\nany conduct before or during the time period of the alleged incident. Further,\r\nCottingham already testified to finding sexually graphic images on a digital camera\r\nand described them in detail. Admission of these other sexually graphic\r\nphotographs was cumulative in nature and further lessened their probative value.\r\nThe photographs' probative value was minimal at best.\r\n\r\nWhile the photographs may have been relevant to the Victim's testimony about\r\nconduct in Lee's home during the time she lived there, we find the prejudicial\r\nnature of these photographs outweighed the probative value. Both photographs\r\nportrayed nude adults in suggestive positions. In one of the photographs, Lee was\r\nlying on a bed with another nude female, his genitalia in full view. The other\r\nphotograph showed two nude females from their chests to their faces. There are no\r\nchildren shown in the photographs. We find their primary purpose was to raise the\r\nemotions of the jury and to establish that Lee had a general sexually deviant\r\ndisposition. After reviewing these photographs, we hold their admission was\r\nhighly prejudicial in light of their sexually graphic nature.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n                   FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       Richard Strawn owned the Property, which was located in Anderson,\r\nSouth Carolina. He gave the Bank a home equity mortgage (the Mortgage)\r\non the Property to secure a credit line of $50,000. The mortgage provided\r\nthat it would be \"governed by and interpreted in accordance with federal law\r\nand the laws of the State of South Carolina.\" On December 12, 2001, he\r\ndeeded the Property to his wife at the time, Cammie Strawn. On October 31,\r\n2003, Marie Borchers purchased the Property from Cammie through a cash\r\nsale. On the day of the closing of the sale, James Belk, the closing attorney\r\nfor the sale, had one of his employees, Cathy Slaton Curtis, hand deliver a\r\ntrust account check to the Bank for the payoff amount on the Mortgage. The\r\ncheck had the words \"Payoff of first Mortgage\" typed on the check. The\r\nBank processed the check but did not mark the Mortgage as satisfied.\r\nSeveral weeks later, the Bank issued Strawn a new set of checks for the line\r\nof credit. He used the checks, resulting in a debt of $72,787.95 including\r\ninterest and penalties.\r\n\r\n       On December 22, 2005, Belk executed a mortgage lien satisfaction\r\naffidavit after the Bank's attorney informed him the Mortgage had not been\r\nsatisfied. On March 1, 2006, the Bank instituted an action against Strawn for\r\nthe collection of the debt and a foreclosure action against Robert K. Borchers,\r\nindividually and as personal representative of the estate of Marie Borchers,\r\nand Nancy Davidson Borchers (collectively the Borchers).1 The Borchers\r\nfiled an answer and counterclaim against the Bank, a crossclaim against\r\nStrawn, and a third-party complaint against Belk. As to the counterclaim\r\nagainst the Bank, the Borchers sought the statutory penalties set forth in\r\nsection 29-3-320 of the South Carolina Code for failure to satisfy the\r\nmortgage within ninety days.\r\n\r\n1Marie had died since purchasing the Property, and Robert and Nancy were\r\nher devisees and succeeded her interest in the Property.\r\n\n      On August 20, 2008, the circuit court granted summary judgment to the\r\nBorchers as to the Bank's foreclosure action, finding the Bank was estopped\r\nfrom foreclosing on the Property because the Bank should have processed the\r\ncheck as a payoff instead of a paydown on Strawn's line of credit and should\r\nhave had the Mortgage satisfied as of record.\r\n\r\n      In March 2010, a nonjury trial was held on the Borchers' counterclaim\r\nagainst the Bank. At trial, Belk testified that as part of the closing, a\r\ntransmittal letter was prepared, stating the trust account check was enclosed\r\nas final payment of the loan. The letter further stated, \"PLEASE FORWARD\r\nSATISFIED DOCUMENTS (with a copy of this letter) TO THIS OFFICE\r\nTO BE REMOVED OF RECORD.\" Curtis testified that she was involved in\r\nthe payoff for this closing. She testified that when she was handling a payoff,\r\nshe would take the check, the payoff letter, and the payoff statement that\r\ncomes from the bank and staple all three of them together, so they would not\r\nget separated in case there were multiple payoffs at the same bank at one\r\ntime. She then would go to the bank and give them the packet, and she\r\nwould get the bottom part of the check once it had been run through the\r\nbank's machine to show the date and time the payoff was made and a receipt.\r\nCurtis had sworn an affidavit on April 14, 2008, she had taken the letter to\r\nBank.  Pamela H. Harbin, a former employee of the Bank, testified she\r\nresearched the Bank's records to determine what it received with the payoff\r\ncheck. She testified she had seen no evidence the Bank had received the\r\nletter. She also provided that if the Bank had received the letter, it would\r\nhave followed the instructions in the letter and would have probably\r\ncontacted Strawn to ask if he wanted the equity line cancelled.\r\n\r\n      The trial court found the testimony conflicted as to whether or not the\r\nBank received notice of the request to satisfy the Mortgage. It found the\r\nBank's review of its records, which occurred more than two years after the\r\nclosing date, was remote, making it just as likely the document was lost as it\r\nwas never received. It noted Belk and Curtis's testimonies were clear that for\r\na local bank, like the Bank, their standard practice was to personally deliver a\r\npayoff letter with the payoff check, which specifically requested the\r\n\nMortgage be satisfied within three months, and Curtis believed she did so in\r\nthis instance. The court found that testimony to be credible. The court\r\ndetermined the Bank violated section 29-3-310 of the South Carolina Code,\r\nmaking it subject to the penalty under section 29-3-320 of the South Carolina\r\nCode and awarded the Borchers $25,000 and attorney's fees and costs from\r\nthe Bank. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       On appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, we will not disturb\r\nthe trial court's findings of fact unless no evidence reasonably supports the\r\nfindings. Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d\r\n773, 775 (1976). Additionally, the appellate court can correct errors of law.\r\nOkatie River, L.L.C. v. Se. Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d\r\n468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003). The trial court's findings in a law action are\r\nequivalent to a jury's findings. Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565,\r\n567, 211 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1975). Questions regarding credibility and the\r\nweight of the evidence are exclusively for the trial court. Sheek v.\r\nCrimestoppers Alarm Sys., 297 S.C. 375, 377, 377 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App.\r\n1989). \"We may not consider the case based on our view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence, but must construe the evidence presented to\r\nthe [trial court] so as to support [its] decision wherever reasonably possible.\"\r\nId. \"We must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\nrespondents and eliminate from consideration all evidence to the contrary.\"\r\nId.                           LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.     Timely Satisfaction of the Mortgage\r\n\r\n      The Bank argues because the Mortgage was timely cancelled as\r\nrequired by section 29-3-310 of the South Carolina Code (2007), the trial\r\ncourt erred in ruling the Bank failed to timely satisfy the Mortgage. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n        Section 29-3-310 provides:\r\n\n                 Any holder of record of a mortgage who has\r\n          received full payment or satisfaction or to whom a\r\n          legal tender has been made of his debts, damages,\r\n          costs, and charges secured by mortgage of real estate\r\n          shall, at the request by certified mail or other form of\r\n          delivery with a proof of delivery of the mortgagor or\r\n          of his legal representative or any other person being a\r\n          creditor of the debtor or a purchaser under him or\r\n          having an interest in any estate bound by the\r\n          mortgage and on tender of the fees of office for\r\n          entering satisfaction, within three months after the\r\n          certified mail, or other form of delivery, with a proof\r\n          of delivery, request is made, enter satisfaction in the\r\n          proper office on the mortgage which shall forever\r\n          thereafter discharge and satisfy the mortgage.\r\n\r\n       Section 29-3-320 of the South Carolina Code (2007) addresses the\r\nliability for failure to enter satisfaction. It states:\r\n\r\n                Any holder of record of a mortgage having\r\n          received such payment, satisfaction, or tender as\r\n          aforesaid who shall not, by himself or his attorney,\r\n          within three months after such certified mail, or other\r\n          form of delivery, with a proof of delivery, request\r\n          and tender of fees of office, repair to the proper office\r\n          and enter satisfaction as aforesaid shall forfeit and\r\n          pay to the person aggrieved a sum of money not\r\n          exceeding one-half of the amount of the debt secured\r\n          by the mortgage, or twenty-five thousand dollars,\r\n          whichever is less, plus actual damages, costs, and\r\n          attorney's fees in the discretion of the court, to be\r\n          recovered by action in any court of competent\r\n          jurisdiction within the State. And on judgment being\r\n          rendered for the plaintiff in any such action, the\r\n          presiding judge shall order satisfaction to be entered\r\n          on the judgment or mortgage aforesaid by the clerk,\r\n          register, or other proper officer whose duty it shall\r\n\n            be, on receiving such order, to record it and to enter\r\n            satisfaction accordingly.\r\n\r\n                   Notwithstanding any limitations under Sections\r\n            37-2-202 and 37-3-202, the holder of record of the\r\n            mortgage may charge a reasonable fee at the time of\r\n            the satisfaction not to exceed twenty-five dollars to\r\n            cover the cost of processing and recording the\r\n            satisfaction or cancellation. If the mortgagor or his\r\n            legal representative instructs the holder of record of\r\n            the mortgage that the mortgagor will be responsible\r\n            for filing the satisfaction, the holder of the mortgage\r\n            shall mail or deliver the satisfied mortgage to the\r\n            mortgagor or his legal representative with no\r\n            satisfaction fee charged.\r\n\r\nId.    To trigger the penalty and related relief provided in section 29-3-320,\r\nsection 29-3-310 requires the mortgagor or purchaser under him to establish\r\n(1) he has made full payment of his debts, including any applicable damages,\r\ncosts, and charges; (2) he has made a request by certified mail or other form\r\nof delivery with a proof of delivery the mortgage be satisfied of record; (3) he\r\nhas made a tender of fees of office for entering satisfaction; and (4) the\r\nmortgagee has failed to enter satisfaction in the proper office on the mortgage\r\nwithin three months of the request. Dykeman v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg.,\r\nInc., 381 S.C. 333, 340, 673 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009).\r\n\r\n       \"For liability to attach under the applicable statutes, payment of the\r\nmortgage is 'only the first step in the mortgage satisfaction process. In order\r\nfor Bostic to recover the statutory penalty under section 29-3-320, he had to\r\nsatisfy the condition precedent of making a request for [the mortgagee] to\r\nrecord his mortgage as satisfied.'\" Id. at 339, 673 S.E.2d at 807 (alterations\r\nby court) (quoting Bostic v. Am. Home Mortg. Servicing, Inc., 375 S.C. 143,\r\n154, 650 S.E.2d 479, 485 (Ct. App. 2007)). \"A request, to trigger the\r\nstatutory penalty, may not be implied or inferred. The request must\r\naffirmatively convey to the mortgagee that a recording of the satisfaction is\r\n\nsought.\" Id. (citation omitted). However, section 29-3-310 does not mandate\r\na written request. Bostic, 375 S.C. at 155, 650 S.E.2d at 485. The statute is\r\nsatisfied if the aggrieved party (1) makes a verbal or written request\r\nexpressing his desire for the mortgagee to satisfy the mortgage and (2)\r\ndemonstrates that the mortgagee has received or agreed to this request. Id.\r\n\r\n      In Dykeman, the Dykemans relied exclusively on their compliance with\r\nthe \"borrower's responsibilities\" document Wells Fargo furnished as their\r\nrequest for satisfaction, which the court found to be insufficient. 381 S.C. at\r\n339 n.3, 673 S.E.2d at 807 n.3. In Bostic, the court found \"Bostic's payoff\r\ncheck sent by certified mail was insufficient to constitute a 'request' within\r\nthe meaning of the statute.\" 375 S.C. at 155, 650 S.E.2d at 485. The court\r\ndetermined: Clearly, the cashier's check without additional\r\n            correspondence, either verbal or written, did not\r\n            affirmatively convey to American Home that Bostic\r\n            expressly desired to have his mortgage recorded as\r\n            satisfied. By sending the payoff check, Bostic\r\n            effectively satisfied his mortgage. However, this\r\n            check was only the first step in the mortgage\r\n            satisfaction process. In order for Bostic to recover the\r\n            statutory penalty under section 29-3-320, he had to\r\n            satisfy the condition precedent of making a \"request\"\r\n            for American Home to record his mortgage as\r\n            satisfied.\r\n\r\nId.    Bostic asserted telephone conversations he alleged to have had with\r\nAmerican Home after he mailed the payoff check could be construed as a\r\n\"request.\" Id. at 155, 650 S.E.2d at 485. However, the court found the record\r\ncontained no evidence an American Home representative spoke with Bostic.\r\nId. at 155, 650 S.E.2d at 485-86. The court further determined \"[b]ecause\r\nthis case was presented to the circuit court at the summary judgment stage\r\nand there is no definitive evidence that a verbal agreement was reached\r\nduring these telephone conversations, we cannot find that American Home\r\n\nwas given a sufficient 'request' which obligated it to mark the mortgage\r\nsatisfied within the statutory time period.\" Id. at 155-56, 650 S.E.2d at 486.\r\n\r\n       The Bank seems to argue that it did not have to cancel the Mortgage\r\nuntil the first circuit court issued its order and by that point, the Mortgage had\r\nalready been cancelled. However, the trial court actually found the Bank\r\nfailed to timely cancel the Mortgage based on when the closing attorney sent\r\nthe satisfaction check. In Bostic, the court found Bostic's sending the payoff\r\ncheck and alleged phone calls to the bank did not constitute a request as\r\nrequired by the statute. In the present case, some evidence supports the trial\r\ncourt's finding the closing attorney had requested the Mortgage be marked as\r\nsatisfied when he sent the check; both Curtis and Belk testified they\r\ngenerated a satisfaction letter as part of standard procedure for a closing, and\r\nBelk stated he reviewed the closing packet and the letter was included in it.\r\nThe trial court found their testimonies credible and found it likely the Bank\r\nhad misplaced the letter in its records based on the length of time before it\r\nchecked its records. Because we leave matters of credibility to the trial court,\r\nwe conclude the record contains evidence supporting the trial court's finding\r\nthat the Borchers complied with the statute by Curtis's delivering the\r\nsatisfaction letter with the check.\r\n\r\n   II.   Open-Ended Mortgage\r\n\r\n      The Bank contends because it had agreed to satisfy the Mortgage only\r\nby the request of the grantor and no such request was made, the trial court\r\nerred by ruling the Bank failed to satisfy the Mortgage as required by section\r\n29-3-310. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law,\r\nand this [c]ourt reviews questions of law de novo.\" Town of Summerville v.\r\nCity of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008). When a\r\nstatute's language is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite\r\nmeaning, the court has no right to impose another meaning. Hodges v.\r\nRainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000). \"The cardinal rule of\r\nstatutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\nlegislature.\" Id. The best evidence of legislative intent is the text of the\r\nstatute. Wade v. State, 348 S.C. 255, 259, 559 S.E.2d 843, 844 (2002). \"All\r\n\nrules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative\r\nintent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used,\r\nand that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of\r\nthe statute.\" Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Comm'n, 342 S.C.\r\n373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000). \"Statutes, as a whole, must receive\r\npractical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose,\r\ndesign, and policy of lawmakers.\" TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue,\r\n331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998). An appellate court will\r\nreject the interpretation of a statute that would lead to an absurd result the\r\nlegislature could not have intended. Lancaster Cnty. Bar Ass'n v. S.C.\r\nComm'n on Indigent Def., 380 S.C. 219, 222, 670 S.E.2d 371, 373 (2008).\r\nWhen \"the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to\r\nlegislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the\r\nborders of the act itself.\" Kennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 348, 549\r\nS.E.2d 243, 247 (2001). In some cases, legislative history may be probative\r\nin determining the legislature's intent. Eagle Container Co. v. Cnty. of\r\nNewberry, 366 S.C. 611, 630, 622 S.E.2d 733, 743 (Ct. App. 2005), rev'd on\r\nother grounds, 379 S.C. 564, 666 S.E.2d 892 (2008).\r\n\r\n                   Any mortgage or other instrument conveying\r\n            an interest in or creating a lien on any real estate,\r\n            securing existing indebtedness or future advances to\r\n            be made, regardless of whether the advances are to be\r\n            made at the option of the lender, are valid from the\r\n            day and hour when recorded so as to affect the rights\r\n            of subsequent creditors, whether lien creditors or\r\n            simple contract creditors, or purchasers for valuable\r\n            consideration without notice to the same extent as if\r\n            the advances were made as of the date of the\r\n            execution of the mortgage or other instrument for the\r\n            total amount of advances made thereunder, together\r\n            with all other indebtedness and sums secured thereby,\r\n            the total amount of existing indebtedness and future\r\n            advances outstanding at any one time may not exceed\r\n            the maximum principal amount stated therein, plus\r\n            interest thereon, attorney's fees and court costs.\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 29-3-50(A) (2007).\r\n\r\n            The statute clearly sanctions the right of parties to\r\n            give and to accept open-end mortgages to secure\r\n            future advances. There is nothing express or implied,\r\n            in the statute to infer that it was the intent of the\r\n            legislature that the mortgage be dead once there is no\r\n            debt momentarily existing. The statute permits the\r\n            parties to agree that the mortgage live on until the\r\n            mortgagor requests its cancellation. [Former section\r\n            29-3-310] provides for such cancellation. In addition,\r\n            the parties in the mortgage (as quoted hereinabove)\r\n            have expressly agreed that the mortgage live on until\r\n            canceled of record. A holding that an open-end\r\n            mortgage dies when there is currently no debt for it to\r\n            secure, would severely limit its beneficial use and\r\n            defeat the legislative intent. As long as the mortgage\r\n            is of record, any subsequent lien holder or purchaser\r\n            takes with notice of the impact of the Code section.\r\n\r\nCentral Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Page, 268 S.C. 1, 8, 231 S.E.2d 210,\r\n214 (1977).\r\n\r\n       A plain reading of section 29-3-310 does not specify any special\r\nprocedures that lessen a bank's obligation when a mortgage is open ended.\r\nBecause the requirements under the statute are met, the trial court did not err\r\nin finding the Bank violated section 29-3-310.\r\n\r\n   III. Clear and Convincing Evidence\r\n\r\n     The Bank maintains the trial court erred by ruling it failed to satisfy the\r\nMortgage because the Borchers did not present clear and convincing\r\nevidence any request to satisfy the Mortgage was made. We disagree.\r\n\r\n     As we have noted above, the trial court found the Bank failed to timely\r\ncancel the Mortgage based on when the closing attorney sent the satisfaction\r\ncheck. Some evidence supports the trial court's finding the closing attorney\r\n\nhad requested the Mortgage be marked as satisfied when he sent the check;\r\nBelk testified he reviewed the documents and Curtis testified she delivered\r\nthe transmittal letter with the payoff check, which the trial court found more\r\nreliable than Harbin's testimony. Accordingly, the record does contain\r\nevidence to support the trial court's finding that the Borchers met the\r\nrequirements of the statute.\r\n\r\n  IV.   Closing Attorney's Ability to Cancel and Satisfy\r\n\r\n     The Bank argues the trial court erred by ruling it failed to satisfy the\r\nMortgage because the closing attorney had the authority under section 29-3-\r\n330(e) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) to satisfy and cancel the\r\nMortgage. We disagree.\r\n\r\n           (e) Any licensed attorney admitted to practice in the\r\n           State of South Carolina who can provide proof of\r\n           payment of funds by evidence of payment made\r\n           payable to the mortgagee, holder of record, servicer,\r\n           or other party entitled to receive payment may record,\r\n           or cause to be recorded, an affidavit, in writing, duly\r\n           executed in the presence of two witnesses and\r\n           acknowledged pursuant to the Uniform Recognition\r\n           of Acknowledgments Act in Chapter 3, Title 26,\r\n           which states that full payment of the balance or\r\n           payoff amount of the mortgage or other instrument\r\n           securing the payment of money and being a lien upon\r\n           real property has been made and that evidence of\r\n           payment from the mortgagee, assignee, or servicer\r\n           exists. This affidavit, duly recorded in the appropriate\r\n           county, shall serve as notice of satisfaction of the\r\n           mortgage and release of the lien upon the real\r\n           property. The filing of the affidavit shall be sufficient\r\n           to satisfy, release, or discharge the lien. Upon\r\n           presentation of the instrument of satisfaction, release,\r\n           or discharge, the officer or his deputy having charge\r\n           of the recording of instruments shall record the same.\r\n           This section may not be construed to require an\r\n\n            attorney to record an affidavit pursuant to this item or\r\n            to create liability for failure to file such affidavit.\r\n\r\n§ 29-3-330(e).\r\n\r\n      Although section 29-3-330(e) does allow an attorney to enter an\r\naffidavit of satisfaction, nothing in section 29-3-310 or our case law suggests\r\nthat because an attorney has the ability to satisfy a mortgage, the penalty\r\nunder section 29-3-320 does not apply if a bank does not complete a proper\r\nrequest to satisfy the mortgage. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\r\nfinding the Bank violated section 29-3-310.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Evidence supports the trial court's finding the Borchers met the\r\nrequirements under section 29-3-310 of the South Carolina Code to\r\ndemonstrate the Bank failed to satisfy the Mortgage, thus subjecting it to the\r\npenalty under section 29-3-320 of the South Carolina Code. Therefore, the\r\ntrial court's decision is\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      THOMAS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n       FEW, C.J., dissenting: I would reverse the circuit court's decision to\r\naward the Borchers a penalty under sections 29-3-310 and -320 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2007) because there is no evidence in the record the Bank\r\nreceived a cancellation request from Richard C. Strawn—the only person\r\nentitled to make that request. Because no request to cancel was made, section\r\n29-3-310 did not require cancellation of the mortgage and the section 29-3-\r\n320 penalty does not apply.\r\n\r\n      This case involves an open-ended mortgage. Section 29-3-50 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2007) provides that an open-ended mortgage survives a\r\nsale of the underlying property and is binding on a subsequent purchaser.\r\nOur courts have recognized that open-ended mortgages serve a valid purpose\r\nand the occasional incidence of a seemingly-unfair result like the one in this\r\n\ncase is justified by the purpose the open-ended mortgage was designed to\r\nserve. See Cent. Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Page, 268 S.C. 1, 8, 231 S.E.2d 210,\r\n214 (1977) (\"A holding that an open-end mortgage dies when there is\r\ncurrently no debt for it to secure, would severely limit its beneficial use and\r\ndefeat the legislative intent.\"). Therefore, the mere fact that the balance of\r\nthe loan secured by the mortgage is paid off does not require cancellation of\r\nthe mortgage. Rather, the mortgage may not be cancelled unless the proper\r\nperson requests it. Under some circumstances, a \"person . . . having an\r\ninterest in any estate bound by the mortgage\" may request cancellation. § 29-\r\n3-310. Here, however, the terms of the mortgage provided the only person\r\nwith authority to request cancellation of the mortgage was Richard Strawn.\r\nSee Cent. Prod. Credit Ass'n, 268 S.C. at 8, 231 S.E.2d at 214 (stating the\r\npredecessor to section 29-3-310 \"permits the parties to agree that the\r\nmortgage live on until the mortgagor requests its cancellation\"). This\r\ninformation was filed in the public record of Anderson County, and thus was\r\nreadily available to the Borchers and their closing attorney. Viewing the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the Borchers, no person or entity even\r\npurporting to speak on behalf of Richard Strawn made any request to have\r\nthe mortgage cancelled. The October 31, 2003 letter incorrectly states the\r\nmortgagor is \"Cammie B. Strawn,\" who had been divorced from Richard\r\nStrawn since 2001. Cammie Strawn had no authority to request cancellation\r\nof the mortgage. The closing attorney who made the request relied on by the\r\nmajority did not represent Richard Strawn, who was not a party to the real\r\nestate transaction, and therefore the attorney's request was not made on\r\nRichard Strawn's behalf. There is no evidence in the record of any other\r\nrequest to cancel the mortgage. Because no evidence exists that a proper\r\nrequest for cancellation was made, there can be no liability under section 29-\r\n3-320 for failure to honor the request. The circuit court's award of punitive\r\ndamages and attorney's fees is dependent on the validity of the statutory\r\npenalty. I would reverse and enter judgment for the Bank.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5028","title":"Roddey v.

She was being chased by Derrick Jones, an employee\r\n\nof U.S. Security Associates, Inc., which provided security in the Wal-Mart parking\r\nlot pursuant to a contract with Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart management had advised\r\nJones that a passenger in Hancock's vehicle attempted to steal merchandise from\r\nthe store, and they instructed him to get the vehicle's license tag number. At trial,\r\nthe court directed a verdict for Wal-Mart, and the jury returned a defense verdict\r\non the claims against Jones and U.S. Security. Hancock's estate appeals the\r\ndecision to direct a verdict in favor of Wal-Mart. We affirm.\r\n\r\n        I.\t    Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 20, 2006, Hancock drove to Wal-Mart with her sister, Donna\r\nBeckham. Hancock entered the store with Beckham but later returned to her\r\nvehicle in the parking lot. While Hancock waited in the car, Beckham attempted to\r\nshoplift several items from the store by placing them in plastic bags. As Beckham\r\ntestified at trial, \"I then went and got a bag and went and put some pants into the\r\nbag[.] I shouldn't have done it.\"1\r\n\r\nHope Rollings, one of the store's customer service managers, saw Beckham do this.\r\nRollings alerted fellow manager Shaun Cox and several other employees that\r\nBeckham was attempting to steal merchandise. Rollings then walked outside to\r\nspeak with Jones, who was on duty in his company truck. As Rollings and Jones\r\nspoke, Cox used a handheld radio to tell them that Beckham was headed towards\r\none of the exits. Rollings went back inside, and Jones drove to the exit. Jones\r\ntestified he asked over the radio what he should do, as he did not have the authority\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Beckham also testified:\r\n\r\n               Q: \t   And you elected not to leave with [Hancock]\r\n                      because you were attempting to take clothing from\r\n                      the store, correct?\r\n\r\n               A: \t   Couple of pair of jeans, yes.\r\n\r\n               Q: \t   There's no question, Ms. Beckham, you had\r\n                      absolutely no intention of paying for the clothing\r\n                      items that night, did you?\r\n\r\n               A: \t   No, sir.\r\n\nto detain Beckham. He was told to \"try to delay her. Try to talk to her until we\r\ncan get out there.\"\r\n\r\nAs Beckham approached the exit with the bags of merchandise, a Wal-Mart greeter\r\nasked to see her receipt. Beckham told the greeter Hancock had the receipt in the\r\ncar. She testified, \"I told her that my sister had it but that was a lie.\" Beckham\r\nthen put down the bags and walked out of the store. Jones saw Beckham and\r\nspoke to her briefly. Beckham testified Jones screamed at her. Beckham began\r\nrunning towards Hancock's car. Jones followed her in his truck but did not\r\nphysically detain her. Hancock saw Beckham, pulled out of her parking space, and\r\ndrove down a lane of the parking lot towards Beckham. Jones drove into the lane,\r\nblocking Hancock's vehicle. While Hancock's car was still moving, Beckham\r\njumped into the back seat.2 As Beckham later testified, she told Hancock to \"get\r\nthem the hell out of here.\" Hancock put her car in reverse, backed up at a high\r\nspeed, struck a median in the parking lot, turned around, and drove towards the exit\r\nof the parking lot. Jones followed behind her.\r\n\r\nAs these events unfolded, Cox walked to the main entrance of the store and radioed\r\nto Jones, \"Get her tag number.\" According to Jones, he received instructions over\r\nthe radio from Cox and Rollings to get the license tag information from Hancock's\r\nvehicle. Jones testified, \"And I'm on the walkie-talkie, telling them, I can't see this\r\nlicense plate tag number, and they're about to leave the parking lot.\" A Wal-Mart\r\nemployee replied, \"Man, well, you got to do what you got to do. You need to get\r\nthat license plate number.\" These instructions by Wal-Mart personnel violated\r\nWal-Mart's policy for investigating and detaining suspected shoplifters, which\r\nprovided:    NEVER pursue a fleeing Suspect more than\r\n             approximately 10 feet beyond the point you are located\r\n             when the Suspect begins to run to avoid detention. Ten\r\n             feet is about three long steps. This limitation applies\r\n             both inside and outside the facility.\r\n\r\n             NEVER pursue a Suspect who is in a moving vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The word \"jump\" comes from the testimony of Roddey's expert Jeffrey Albert,\r\nwho used the word to describe what he observed in the video of Beckham leaving\r\nthe Wal-Mart and entering Hancock's car.\r\n\n             NEVER pursue a Suspect off the Facility's property.\r\n\r\n             NEVER use a moving vehicle to pursue a Suspect.\r\n\r\n             TERMINATE the pursuit of a Suspect, if the Suspect\r\n             begins to enter a vehicle.\r\n\r\n             LET THE SUSPECT GO, rather than continue a pursuit\r\n             that is likely to injure or cause harm to someone.\r\n\r\nAs Hancock left the parking lot and drove onto a highway, she ran a stop sign and\r\na stop light, nearly getting into an accident. In violation of his training and U.S.\r\nSecurity policy, Jones left the parking lot and pursued Hancock and Beckham onto\r\nthe highway. According to Jones, Hancock drove up an onramp, \"almost\r\nslamm[ing] into the back of another lady's car\" and missing it by swerving to the\r\nleft. Jones testified he lost Hancock and Beckham at that point, and he did not find\r\nthem again until he saw her vehicle's hazard lights flashing off of the side of the\r\nroad. However, Beckham testified Jones stayed close behind them. Crouching in\r\nthe back seat, she periodically looked up over the seat and saw Jones driving \"on\r\n[their] bumper\" and flashing the high-beams on his truck. After about two miles,\r\nHancock told Beckham \"he's still on our ass,\" and then Beckham heard and felt a\r\nbump. Hancock's car left the road and crashed. Hancock died at the scene.\r\n\r\nTravis Roddey, the personal representative of Hancock's estate, sued Wal-Mart,\r\nU.S. Security, and Jones for negligence. At trial, the court granted Wal-Mart's\r\nmotion for a directed verdict. The jury found Hancock was 65% at fault and U.S.\r\nSecurity and Jones were 35% at fault. Roddey filed a motion under Rule 59(e),\r\nSCRCP, seeking a new trial as to all defendants on the basis that the court erred in\r\ndirecting a verdict for Wal-Mart. The court denied the motion.\r\n\r\n      II.    How the Panel Votes to Affirm\r\n\r\nWal-Mart asserted three grounds for its directed verdict motion: (1) Roddey\r\npresented no evidence Wal-Mart breached its duty of care; (2) Wal-Mart's actions\r\nwere not the proximate cause of Hancock's death as a matter of law because Jones'\r\nand Hancock's actions were not foreseeable; and (3) Hancock's fault in causing her\r\nown death was more than 50% as a matter of law. The trial court granted the\r\nmotion on the first two grounds, stating \"I . . . find that there is insufficient\r\nevidence that Wal-Mart was negligent, or even if [it was] there is a lack of\r\n\nproximate cause [in] that the events were not foreseeable.\" As to the third ground,\r\nthe court stated it was \"[un]able to find as a matter of law that Hancock was more\r\nthan 50 percent [at fault].\"\r\n\r\nJudge Huff and I believe the trial court erred in finding there was insufficient\r\nevidence of Wal-Mart's negligence and in finding Jones' and Hancock's actions\r\nwere not foreseeable. However, I vote to affirm because I believe Hancock was\r\nmore than 50% at fault. As Judge Short explains in his concurring opinion, he\r\nvotes to affirm because he believes the trial court correctly found no proximate\r\ncause as a matter of law. As Judge Huff explains in his dissent, he would reverse\r\nand remand for a new trial as to Wal-Mart.\r\n\r\n      III.   Evidence of Wal-Mart's Negligence\r\n\r\nCox and Rollings' instructions that Jones get the tag number of Hancock's vehicle,\r\nincluding the command \"do what you got to do,\" violated the Wal-Mart policy\r\ndesigned to prevent injuries and deaths caused by fleeing suspects. A defendant's\r\nviolation of its own safety policies is some evidence of negligence. See Madison\r\nex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 140, 638 S.E.2d 650, 659 (2006)\r\n(stating a defendant's standard of care in a negligence action \"may be established\r\nand defined by . . . a defendant's own policies and guidelines\"); Peterson v. Nat'l\r\nR.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 397, 618 S.E.2d 903, 906 (2005) (holding\r\n\"evidence of [a defendant's] deviation from their internal maintenance policies is\r\nadmissible to show the element of the breach\"); Tidwell v. Columbia Ry., Gas &\r\nElec. Co., 109 S.C. 34, 35, 95 S.E. 109, 109 (1918) (stating \"violation [of a\r\ndefendant's rules] was evidence tending to show negligence\"); Caldwell v. K-Mart\r\nCorp., 306 S.C. 27, 31, 410 S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 1991) (stating a jury may\r\nconsider violations of internal policies or self-imposed rules as evidence of\r\nnegligence). Therefore, the trial court should not have directed a verdict on the\r\nbasis that there was insufficient evidence of negligence.\r\n\r\n      IV.    Foreseeability of Hancock's Actions\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Wal-Mart's policy is to prevent injury or death resulting from\r\nnegligent or reckless driving in pursuit of a suspect. The policy states: \"LET THE\r\nSUSPECT GO, rather than continue a pursuit that is likely to injure or cause harm\r\nto someone. . . . Remember to put people first. Protecting the physical well-being\r\nof Suspects . . . is your first priority.\" Similar instructions and reminders to \"put\r\npeople first\" appear throughout the policy. The danger sought to be prevented by\r\n\nthis policy arises from the anticipated negligent or reckless driving of the pursuer\r\nand the pursued. Therefore, the danger that a fleeing suspect or the security officer\r\nchasing her might drive negligently or recklessly and injure the suspect or someone\r\nelse is not simply foreseeable—it is the very reason Wal-Mart adopted the policy\r\nin the first place. I disagree that Jones' and Hancock's actions were not foreseeable\r\nto Wal-Mart.\r\n\r\n      V.     Hancock's Fault\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons this court should hold that Hancock was more than 50% at\r\nfault and on that basis affirm the directed verdict in favor of Wal-Mart. First, the\r\njury's factual determination of how fault should be apportioned between Hancock,\r\nJones, and U.S. Security is binding on Roddey even though Wal-Mart's actions\r\nwere not included in the jury's analysis. Second, the trial court should have\r\ndirected a verdict for Wal-Mart on the ground that Hancock was more than 50% at\r\nfault as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n             a.     Effect of the Jury's Apportionment of Fault\r\n\r\nIn his post-trial motion, Roddey stated his theory of the case is that the \"car\r\naccident was due less to the decedent's actions and more to (1) Wal-Mart's decision\r\nto encourage Derrick Jones to chase the decedent by vehicle, and (2) Jones' actions\r\nduring the chase—flashing his lights and driving on the decedent's bumper.\" The\r\nspecific allegations in Roddey's complaint were that Wal-Mart was liable in three\r\nways: (1) it was vicariously liable for Jones' actions; (2) it failed to properly\r\nsupervise Jones; and (3) it \"improperly advised or instructed\" Jones to follow\r\nHancock and obtain her license tag information.3 None of these allegations can\r\npossibly result in liability against Wal-Mart, now that the jury has found Hancock\r\nto be 65% at fault in the accident.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first allegation, Roddey claims Jones was Wal-Mart's agent,\r\nand therefore Wal-Mart is vicariously liable for his conduct. Roddey's right to\r\nrecover from Wal-Mart under this claim depends entirely on whether Jones was\r\nliable. In other words, because Wal-Mart's liability is derivative of Jones' liability,\r\n\r\n\r\n3The complaint is not in the record on appeal. Roddey described his allegations in\r\none of his briefs to this court.\r\n\nthe jury's finding that Jones was only 35% at fault forecloses the liability of Wal-\r\nMart.\r\n\r\nRoddey's other two allegations involve acts and omissions by Wal-Mart. Roddey\r\nargues that because the jury apportioned fault only between Hancock, Jones, and\r\nU.S. Security, Wal-Mart's conduct, if considered by the jury, could have reduced\r\nHancock's proportion of fault to the point that her negligence was not greater than\r\nthat of all the defendants. See Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 245,\r\n399 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1991) (\"If there is more than one defendant, the plaintiff's\r\nnegligence shall be compared to the combined negligence of all defendants.\"). In\r\nmany cases involving multiple tortfeasors, the negligence of a tortfeasor absent\r\nfrom the case could affect the relative fault of the plaintiff. In this case, however,\r\nWal-Mart's conduct cannot reduce Hancock's proportion of fault.\r\n\r\nThe jury's comparison of fault necessarily involved an examination of the actions\r\ntaken by the two participants in the chase—Hancock and Jones—and a\r\ndetermination of how their actions contributed to Hancock's death. Evidence was\r\npresented that Hancock drove through the parking lot towards Beckham as she ran\r\nfrom the store, did not stop the car as Beckham jumped into it, backed up in the\r\nparking lot at a high rate of speed, hit a concrete median, ran a stop sign and a stop\r\nlight as she turned onto a public highway, swerved through traffic, and narrowly\r\navoided two collisions with other cars.4 There was also evidence that Jones\r\nblocked Hancock's car, pursued her through the parking lot, left his assigned area,\r\nfollowed Hancock's car onto the highway, drove \"on [the] bumper\" of Hancock's\r\ncar on the highway, flashed his headlights, and possibly made contact with\r\nHancock's car. Whatever Jones' and Hancock's motivation may have been for\r\ntaking those actions, it was the actions themselves that proximately caused the\r\ncrash that killed Hancock. The jury already considered all of those actions, and it\r\ndetermined Hancock's actions made her 65% at fault.\r\n\r\nEven under Roddey's theory of the case, Wal-Mart's conduct merely provides some\r\nexplanation of what motivated Jones' actions. Wal-Mart's negligence could affect\r\nhow much of the remaining 35% of fault is attributable to Jones, for if Jones was\r\nmotivated by Wal-Mart's improper actions, arguably he would bear less of the fault\r\n\r\n4 Because I am explaining evidence the jury considered in its apportionment of\r\nfault, I do not view the evidence described in this sentence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Roddey. In all other portions of the opinion, I have described the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to Roddey.\r\n\nfor Hancock's death. However, Wal-Mart's actions can have no effect on\r\nHancock's fault. Wal-Mart obviously did not advise or instruct Hancock to flee,\r\nnor did it enable her actions by failing to adequately supervise her. There is no\r\nevidence in the record that Hancock knew anything about what Wal-Mart told\r\nJones. Therefore, Wal-Mart's alleged conduct could not have reduced Hancock's\r\nproportion of fault in the way it could have reduced that of Jones. Even if the jury\r\nhad been permitted to consider Wal-Mart in its apportionment of fault, Wal-Mart's\r\nconduct could not have affected the jury's determination that Hancock was 65% at\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nBecause Wal-Mart's conduct could not have reduced Hancock's fault, Roddey is\r\nbound by the jury's finding that she was 65% at fault, and the trial court's decision\r\nto grant Wal-Mart a directed verdict could not have prejudiced Roddey. Therefore,\r\nI believe we must affirm. See O'Neal v. Carolina Farm Supply of Johnston, Inc.,\r\n279 S.C. 490, 497, 309 S.E.2d 776, 780 (Ct. App. 1983) (affirming directed verdict\r\nwithout deciding whether trial court erred because jury's verdict made error\r\nharmless).   b.    Hancock's Fault as a Matter of Law\r\n\r\nI would also affirm on the basis that no reasonable jury could have concluded\r\nHancock was 50% or less at fault. See Erickson v. Jones Street Publishers, L.L.C.,\r\n368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006) (\"The appellate court must\r\ndetermine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably\r\npossible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.\"); Bloom v. Ravoira,\r\n339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 712-13 (2000) (stating a plaintiff in a\r\nnegligence action \"may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater\r\nthan that of the defendant\"). Beckham testified Hancock \"had no idea I was going\r\nin there to steal.\" However, the evidence is overwhelming that once Beckham\r\n\"jumped\" into the back seat of Hancock's moving car, Hancock was aware that she\r\nwas fleeing a crime scene. Rather than testifying Hancock did not know they were\r\nfleeing the Wal-Mart, Beckham testified she commanded Hancock to \"get them the\r\nhell out of here.\" Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to Roddey,\r\nno reasonable jury could have concluded Hancock's fault was not greater than the\r\nfault of the defendants, even including Wal-Mart. See Bloom, 339 S.C. at 424, 529\r\nS.E.2d at 714 (\"Any factual issues which might exist as to Ravoira's fault in this\r\naccident cannot alter the inescapable conclusion that, as a matter of law, Bloom's\r\nfault exceeded fifty percent.\"). Therefore, even though the trial court did not grant\r\nthe motion for directed verdict on this basis, I would affirm. See Rule 220(c),\r\n\nSCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment\r\nupon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\").\r\n\r\n      VI.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe trial court's decision to direct a verdict in favor of Wal-Mart is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurring in a separate opinion: I agree the trial court's order\r\nshould be affirmed. I write separately because I would decline to rule on whether\r\nWal-Mart breached its duty to Hancock and whether Hancock was more than 50%\r\nat fault. Rather, I affirm because even when viewing the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Roddey, I find Wal-Mart was entitled to a directed verdict on the\r\nproximate cause element of Roddey's negligence action based on the\r\nunforeseeability of Jones' actions. See Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561\r\nS.E.2d 597, 599 (2002) (explaining that in reviewing a motion for directed verdict,\r\nthe evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party).\r\nWal-Mart argued:\r\n\r\n             This event . . . is about as classically unforeseeable as\r\n             any event in the history of the law and there was simply\r\n             no way for anyone to foresee that Derrick Jones would\r\n             pursue Ms. Hancock off of the premises of Wal-Mart in a\r\n             high speed pursuit just because he was asked to get a\r\n             license tag on the premises. So on the grounds that no\r\n             negligence on the part of Wal-Mart, secondly on the\r\n             ground that no negligence of Wal-Mart was the\r\n             proximate cause, we would ask that the Court grant our\r\n             motion for directed verdict as to Wal-Mart . . . .\r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled: \"I do find that there is insufficient evidence that Wal-Mart\r\nwas negligent, or even if they were[,] there is lack of proximate cause that the\r\nevents were not foreseeable . . . .\"\r\n\r\nI agree with the trial court that Wal-Mart was entitled to directed verdict based on\r\nproximate cause. I conclude Roddey failed to establish legal cause sufficient to\r\n\nsubmit the question to the jury. \"Proximate cause requires proof of both causation\r\nin fact and legal cause.\" Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 463, 494\r\nS.E.2d 835, 842 (Ct. App. 1997). \"Legal cause is proved by establishing\r\nforeseeability.\" Id. The test of foreseeability is whether the injury is the natural\r\nand probable consequence of the alleged negligent act. Koester v. Carolina Rental\r\nCtr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994). \"Where the injury\r\ncomplained of is not reasonably foreseeable there is no liability.\" Crolley v.\r\nHutchins, 300 S.C. 355, 357, 387 S.E.2d 716, 717 (Ct. App. 1989). Where\r\nintervening acts occur, the original wrongdoer may be liable despite intervening\r\nacts if the intervening acts are foreseeable, or if not foreseeable, if the original\r\nwrongdoer's acts \"'would have caused the loss in natural course.'\" Young v. Tide\r\nCraft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 463, 242 S.E.2d 671, 676 (1978) (quoting Benford v.\r\nBerkeley Heating Co., 258 S.C. 357, 365, 188 S.E.2d 841 (1972)).\r\n\r\nI agree with the learned trial court that it was not foreseeable to Wal-Mart that\r\nJones would leave the parking lot and continue pursuit for several miles while\r\nflashing his high-beams and aggressively following Hancock as she ran a stop sign\r\nand a stop light and drove onto a highway. I would affirm the trial court's finding\r\nthat Wal-Mart was entitled to directed verdict based on the lack of foreseeability of\r\nJones' actions. See Stone v. Bethea, 251 S.C. 157, 161-62, 161 S.E.2d 171, 173\r\n(1968) (\"One is not charged with foreseeing that which is unpredictable or that\r\nwhich could not be expected to happen. When the [original wrongdoer's]\r\nnegligence appears merely to have brought about a condition of affairs, or a\r\nsituation in which another and entirely independent and efficient agency intervenes\r\nto cause the injury, the latter is to be deemed the direct or proximate cause, and the\r\nformer only the indirect or remote cause.\"); Dixon v. Besco Eng'g, Inc., 320 S.C.\r\n174, 180, 463 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"For an intervening act to break\r\nthe causal link and insulate the tortfeasor from further liability, the intervening act\r\nmust be unforeseeable.\").\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., dissenting: I respectfully dissent. While I agree with Chief Judge Few\r\nthat there is evidence of Wal-Mart's negligence in this matter that was foreseeable,\r\nI do not agree that the jury's finding that Hancock was 65% negligent renders\r\nHancock 65% negligent as a matter of law, and that this jury finding is binding on\r\nRoddey as to his cause of action against Wal-Mart, considering that Wal-Mart's\r\nnegligence was not factored into the jury's determination. Further, I disagree with\r\nJudge Short's determination that Wal-Mart was entitled to a directed verdict\r\nbecause there was no proximate cause as a matter of law. Accordingly, I would\r\nreverse and remand for a new trial against Wal-Mart.\r\n\nTravis A. Roddey, as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Alice Monique\r\nBeckham Hancock, brought this tort action against Wal-Mart Stores East, LP\r\n(Wal-Mart), U.S. Security Associates, Inc. (USSA), and Derrick L. Jones,\r\nstemming from Hancock's death following an alleged vehicular pursuit by private\r\nsecurity guard Jones, an employee of USSA who was stationed at the Lancaster\r\nWal-Mart. From an order of the trial court granting Wal-Mart a directed verdict,\r\nRoddey appeals.\r\n\r\n    I.    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe following facts are undisputed. On the night of June 20, 2006, Alice Monique\r\nBeckham Hancock and her sister, Donna Beckham, entered the Lancaster Wal-\r\nMart together, but at some point Hancock returned to her car in the parking lot,\r\nwhile Beckham remained inside the store. After Hancock left, Beckham selected\r\nsome clothing with the intent to remove the items from the store without paying for\r\nthem. One of Wal-Mart's Customer Service Managers, Hope Rawlings, observed\r\nBeckham placing items in a bag at a register where there was no cashier. Rawlings\r\nradioed Shaun Cox, another Customer Service manager on duty that night, asked\r\nCox to come to the front of the store, and informed Cox about what she had\r\nobserved.5 Rawlings then approached both door greeters to instruct them to ask\r\nBeckham for a receipt, while Cox continued to observe Beckham. Cox pointed to\r\nBeckham for the store greeter, who then asked Beckham for her receipt. Beckham\r\nlied to the greeter, stating her sister had the receipt. Beckham then put the bag on\r\nthe ground and walked out the door. During this time, as Rawlings reached the\r\ngrocery door, she saw Derrick Jones in the security guard truck outside the door\r\nand walked outside to tell Jones about the shoplifter. As she did this, Cox radioed\r\nthat Beckham was walking out the general merchandise door. There is varying\r\nwitness testimony in regard to other matters, in particular between Jones and the\r\ntwo Wal-Mart employees, Rawlings and Cox, and between Jones and Beckham.\r\n\r\nJones' Testimony\r\n\r\nJones testified that he received a call over the walkie-talkie that a shoplifter was\r\nleaving through the general merchandise door. Jones responded by asking what\r\nthey wanted him to do, as he was a security officer, not a police officer, and he\r\n\r\n5Besides Jones, Rawlings, Cox, and Wal-Mart employee Chuck Campbell had\r\nwalkie-talkies on them that night.\r\n\ncould not detain an individual. He was then instructed to delay the shoplifter,\r\ntalking to her until someone could get out there. As the shoplifter walked in front\r\nof his truck, he asked how she was doing, and requested to talk to her. The woman\r\nresponded that she first had to throw her bag in her car, but would be right back.\r\nWhen Jones told her she did not need to do that, and their conversation would only\r\ntake a minute, the woman \"took off running.\" The woman got in a car, and those\r\nin the car were trying to leave the parking lot, but Jones used his truck to\r\nintentionally block their exit, at which point they backed up their car. Jones stated\r\nhe blocked the car because he had been instructed by Rawlings and Cox that he\r\nhad to get the license plate tag number. He maintained \"the way they [Wal-Mart\r\nemployees] were coming off,\" if he did not get the tag number he could be fired.\r\nJones stated that both Rawlings and Cox were asking him to get the tag number,\r\nand he felt a sense of urgency in the request. As the suspects fled in their car,\r\nJones observed that they almost had an accident in the Wal-Mart parking lot,\r\ncausing him to slow down, which in turn allowed cars to get between them. Jones\r\nstated it was not a \"chase,\" and he was just trying to get the tag number. Jones\r\nacknowledged he knew he was not supposed to follow them out of the parking lot,\r\nbut all he was being told was, \"Look, you got to get this license plate tag number.\"\r\nHe therefore felt he had to get the tag number, even if he had to leave the parking\r\nlot to do it, because \"that's the way they came across.\" Jones testified it was like\r\n\"we can care less whether you leave the parking lot or not. You need to get that\r\nlicense plate tag number.\" Jones again acknowledged that he should not have\r\nfollowed them out of the parking lot because he was not a policeman and he was\r\nnot able to detain individuals, but he felt it was urgent that he obtain the tag\r\nnumber because of the way the Wal-Mart employees were \"coming across.\" Jones\r\ntestified, \"And I'm on the walkie-talkie, telling them, I can't see this license plate\r\ntag number, and they're about to leave the parking lot. Man, well, you got to do\r\nwhat you got to do. You need to get that license plate number.\"\r\n\r\nOnce Hancock and Beckham left the parking lot, Jones observed a second near-\r\naccident between them and another car. According to Jones, he lost track of the\r\nwomen after they left the parking lot, but he continued to search for them in hopes\r\nof getting their tag number. Once he thought he had lost them, he turned his truck\r\naround. Thereafter, he saw headlights or hazard lights flashing and heard someone\r\nscreaming for help. As he reached the car, he found the screaming passenger\r\npinned by a chair, and the driver faintly breathing. Unable to get the passenger\r\ndoor open, Jones went to the road and stopped a passing motorist, who then called\r\nfor help.\r\n\nJones again recognized he was wrong for leaving the parking lot and stated, \"That\r\nwas my mistake,\" indicating he made that mistake due to the fact that he was being\r\ntold, \"Oh, you need that license plate tag number,\" and \"Go get it.\" Jones agreed\r\nthat Wal-Mart's instructions to him caused him to not think about \"safety first,\"\r\nexplaining that it happened so fast that he did not think clearly and stating as\r\nfollows: \" - - when they're telling you, 'Look, man. You got to get that license\r\nplate tag. Yo - - get that license plate tag.' And I'm telling them, 'Well, they\r\nleaving the parking lot' - - 'Well, get that license plate tag number.' And that's all\r\nI'm hearing.\" Jones agreed Cox and Rawlings never instructed him to leave the\r\nparking lot to get the tag number, but he testified as follows: \"[T]hey did stress that\r\nI needed to get the license plate tag number after I told them, 'Well, look we're - -\r\nwe're leaving the parking lot now. You - - well, you - - you need to get that\r\nlicense plate number.\" (emphasis added). Jones testified the last communication he\r\nhad with someone from Wal-Mart was as he was on a ramp heading toward a\r\nhighway, less than a mile from Wal-Mart, with communication starting to break up\r\nthen. The last clear conversation he had with them was as he was following behind\r\nHancock and Beckham once they left the Wal-Mart parking lot.\r\n\r\nBeckham's Testimony\r\n\r\nBeckham testified that as she walked out of Wal-Mart, Jones was in the security\r\ntruck and screamed at her stating, \"Hey, I need to talk to you.\" Beckham told him,\r\n\"No, you don't,\" and started jogging to her sister's car. Jones \"zoomed in on\" them\r\nin his truck, and Beckham got in the back seat of Hancock's car. Jones pulled in\r\nfront of them. As they went through the parking lot, Jones was \"on [them].\"\r\nBeckham was crouched down in the back seat, but periodically \"popped up\" to\r\nlook, and observed Jones \"flashing his high beams with the light on top,\" staying\r\non them as if she had gone into Wal-Mart \"with a gun.\" They left the parking lot,\r\nand drove a couple of miles before the accident occurred, during which time Jones\r\nwas on their bumper. Right before the crash, Beckham heard and felt a bump, and\r\nthey shot off the road to the left. Just before they ran off the road, she heard\r\nHancock say, \"He's still on our ass,\" and Beckham saw the high beams still\r\nflashing. According to Beckham, Hancock had no idea she was going to attempt to\r\nshoplift from the store.\r\n\r\nRawlings' Testimony\r\n\r\nRawlings testified that her purpose in going to Jones and telling him about the\r\nshoplifter was for security for the door greeters who stopped the suspected person\r\n\nuntil management could arrive. Rawlings stated, before Cox came over the radio,\r\nshe only told Jones that they had a shoplifter and she had seen the person putting\r\nitems in a bag. She did not intend for her, or Jones, to stop or detain Beckham in\r\nany way, and denied that she asked Jones to approach or delay Beckham or even\r\ntalk to Beckham. After Cox came over the radio, Jones went toward the general\r\nmerchandise door, and Rawlings went back inside Wal-Mart from the grocery\r\nentrance and headed to the general merchandise door. As she reached the general\r\nmerchandise door, she observed both Hancock and Jones run a stop sign and then\r\nrun through a traffic light. Rawlings testified that she was \"stunned\" by this, and\r\ncould not believe they left the parking lot. She did not expect Jones to leave the\r\nparking lot and continue to follow the car, nor did she ever tell Jones to pursue\r\nHancock and Beckham. When asked if she could have radioed Jones and told him\r\nto stop, Rawlings stated, \"It just all happened so fast and [Cox] was on the walkie\r\ntrying to get Chuck up there and only one person can talk at a time on a walkie,\"\r\nsuch that someone would not be able to make use of it if another had the receiver\r\npressed. Rawlings denied asking Jones to stop or delay the suspected shoplifter.\r\nAs to the assertion Cox told Jones to obtain the license plate number of Hancock's\r\ncar, Rawlings stated she remembered Cox stating, \"Just get the tag number.\"\r\n\r\nTestimony of Cox\r\n\r\nCox testified that after the greeter spoke to Beckham, Beckham put down the bag,\r\nlooked in her purse, said something to the greeter and then walked out the door.\r\nShe and the door greeter did not chase or attempt to detain Beckham, and Cox did\r\nnot ask Jones to stop or detain Beckham, to approach Beckham, to delay Beckham,\r\nor to even talk to Beckham. Cox walked toward the door after speaking to the\r\ngreeter because she was curious to see what was going to happen. When Cox\r\nwalked outside, she saw that Jones had pulled into the aisle, Beckham's car had\r\ncome out in reverse, and the chase began. Beckham's car hit a median in the\r\nparking lot, went backwards, she \"flipped her car around\" to face the proper\r\ndirection, and they exited the parking lot. As soon as Cox saw Hancock's car turn\r\nto go the other direction, Cox stated, \"Get her tag number.\" Cox testified she did\r\nnot instruct Jones to get the tag number when his truck was in front of the other\r\ncar, but only after the pursuit had begun. She also stated she only instructed Jones\r\nto get the tag number one time, and she did so because she did not know why Jones\r\nwas chasing her and what had happened in the parking lot prior to that, and thought\r\nif he got the tag number when they left that the matter could be handled at a\r\ndifferent time. Cox did not think Jones would leave the parking lot and was very\r\nsurprised when he did. When asked if she could have told Jones to stop, Cox\r\n\nstated she could have, but it happened so fast that it did not occur to her, because\r\nshe had never encountered such a situation, and she was \"shocked and scared\" and\r\ndid not know what to do. She later clarified that she or Rawlings could have called\r\nJones off of the pursuit if no one else was speaking on the radio at the time and if\r\nshe was aware that Jones could still hear them over the radio by the time he\r\nreached the back of the building. Cox did not intend for Jones to follow the\r\nwomen out of the parking lot, but meant for Jones to stop, instructing Jones to \"get\r\nher tag number.\"\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Experts' Testimony\r\n\r\n1.    Jeff Gross\r\n\r\nJeff Gross, Roddey's expert witness in parking lot security, guard force\r\nmanagement, and loss prevention, testified concerning Wal-Mart's policies and\r\nguidelines, and the breach of some of those in this situation. Specifically, Gross\r\nnoted Wal-Mart's Guidelines for Private Security Contractors provide that it is the\r\nprimary function of the private security contractor to provide customers with a safe\r\nshopping experience, and the basic security method consists of two parts: \"The\r\nfirst, protection, enables the security contractor to protect persons and property by\r\nacting as a deterrent in order to prevent thefts, damages, or accidents. The second,\r\ncommunications, enables the security contractor to be a source of information to\r\nWal-Mart management.\" The guidelines further provide that the security guard's\r\n\"patrol vehicle should not leave Wal-Mart property except for gas or maintenance,\"\r\nand it was Gross's opinion that provision was \"clearly\" violated in this case.6\r\nGross also noted Wal-Mart's Investigation and Detention of Shoplifters Policy\r\nincludes the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 The Guidelines themselves are in the record and include the following provisions,\r\n\"At no time should you try to apprehend, or use your vehicle to apprehend any\r\nsuspects; . . . Security Contractors are not a policing force and should not be used\r\nas one. It's Wal-Mart management's responsibility to enforce Wal-Mart policies\r\nand procedures; . . . In the event of a shoplifter situation, the security contractor\r\nshould act as a witness, and only assist when directed to by a member of Wal-Mart\r\nmanagement or Loss Prevention, or when you see the Wal-Mart associate in\r\ntrouble or danger; . . . Remember, Security Contractors are precluded from\r\nsearching or pursuing suspects, etc.\"\r\n\n             NEVER pursue a fleeing Suspect more than\r\n             approximately 10 feet beyond the point you are located\r\n             when the Suspect begins to run to avoid detention. Ten\r\n             feet is about three long steps. This limitation applies\r\n             both inside and outside the facility.\r\n\r\n             NEVER pursue a Suspect who is in a moving vehicle.\r\n\r\n             NEVER pursue a Suspect off the Facility's property.\r\n\r\n             NEVER use a moving vehicle to pursue a Suspect.\r\n\r\n             TERMINATE the pursuit of a Suspect, if the Suspect\r\n             begins to enter a vehicle.7\r\n\r\nGross testified that in his opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty, these\r\npolicies were violated. When asked who broke these rules, he replied that USSA,\r\nJones, and \"through tacit approval Wal-Mart,\" as Wal-Mart did not \"do anything to\r\nstop [Jones],\" but instructed him to get the license plate number, giving him no\r\nother direction or guidance. When asked whether he had an opinion to a\r\nreasonable degree of certainty about whether Wal-Mart's failure to ask Jones to\r\nstop the chase was a breach of safety rules, Gross opined that it \"increased the risks\r\ndramatically,\" noting if Jones had not gone after them, they would not have sped\r\naway. Gross stated, \"the very headwaters of this problem starts (sic) with them not\r\nfollowing their own policies . . . asking [Jones] to do something that Wal-Mart\r\nspecifically says they won't do themselves and they don't want their contractors to\r\ndo.\" Asked if he had an opinion whether Wal-Mart, as a major retailer, knew\r\nabout what could happen if something escalated, Gross opined Wal-Mart would\r\nhave known based upon Wal-Mart's policies regarding \"not chasing,\" and \"about\r\nmerchandise not being worth an employee being injured.\" Gross noted Wal-Mart\r\nhad identified the results of doing certain things to the point that Wal-Mart was\r\n\r\n7Wal-Mart's Shoplifters Policy further specifically indicates that only certain\r\nauthorized associates are allowed to surveil, investigate or detain a suspected\r\nshoplifter and may do so only in the presence of another Associate. This policy\r\nalso emphasizes, reiterating often, that the authorized associate must let the suspect\r\ngo rather than continue a pursuit that is \"likely to injure or cause harm to\r\nsomeone,\" and that the authorized associate should terminate the pursuit of a\r\nsuspect if the suspect begins to enter a vehicle.\r\n\nspecific about not wanting those things to be done. Asked if he had an opinion\r\nabout whether Wal-Mart violated its own policy by escalating the situation he\r\nstated, \"They caused it to escalate . . . by telling [Jones] to do something their\r\npolicy says you don't do. They won't allow their own people to do this but they\r\ninstructed him to do it.\"\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Gross agreed he had no problem with anything Wal-Mart\r\ndid within the store that evening relating to this matter, but only questioned Wal-\r\nMart's (1) decision to ask Jones to get the license tag and (2) failure to call Jones\r\nback once he pursued Hancock off the premises. Gross further agreed that it was\r\nokay to ask a security officer in the parking lot to observe and report a license tag\r\nif it could be done without extraordinary effort, and he had no problem with Jones\r\ngetting the tag number in the parking lot had he not pursued the vehicle, if it was\r\ndone in a safe fashion. However, it was not reasonable when done the way Jones\r\ndid it. When asked about the Wal-Mart employees' failure to call Jones back and\r\nthe fact that the parking lot incident lasted about thirty to forty seconds, Gross\r\nmaintained they could have used the radio to communicate with Jones and the\r\nemployee had enough time to process the information when she watched Jones\r\nleave the property, but she did nothing. He further noted that there was testimony\r\nindicating the range of the walkie-talkies was sufficient for communication off of\r\nthe property.\r\n\r\n2.    Jeffrey Albert\r\n\r\nRoddey also presented the testimony of Jeffrey Albert, who was qualified as an\r\nexpert in the field of pursuit and the behavior of people being pursued. Albert was\r\nof the opinion that the pursuit started in the Wal-Mart parking lot once Jones\r\n\"continued to follow, continued to go after Beckham,\" and lasted until the crash.\r\nHe characterized Jones' actions as reckless, raising the risks beyond what was\r\nreasonably necessary. Albert also testified that he had performed studies on the\r\nactions of people being pursued and found there is a pattern where fleeing drivers\r\ntend to look behind them in order to observe what the pursuing person is doing,\r\nand a fleeing driver, who is going faster, may also be distracted by flashing lights.\r\nAlbert opined that Jones \"clearly . . . violated every rule in the book . . . by leaving\r\nthe parking lot and going after the car against policy, against common sense,\r\nagainst training, against what he was told and raising the risk . . . to . . . certainly\r\nthe driver and passenger in the car.\" When asked his opinion of whether these\r\nimproper actions contributed to the crash, Albert testified, \"In the sense that had he\r\ndone what he should have done, stayed in the parking lot, not gone after her it's\r\n\nhighly unlikely that that crash would have taken place.\" Albert agreed he had no\r\nproblem with Wal-Mart trying to obtain the license tag number of the vehicle while\r\nin the parking lot, assuming there was no pursuit involved. He also acknowledged\r\nthere was conflicting evidence of whether there was a continued pursuit until the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nOther Testimony and Evidence\r\n\r\n1.    Samuel Plyler\r\n\r\nSamuel Plyler, a volunteer firefighter who lived close to the scene of the accident\r\nand arrived at the accident site within minutes of dispatch, testified he observed a\r\ngentleman in a security officer uniform at the scene. This person was saying \"they\r\nneed help and I got myself in a situation.\" Notably, when Plyler turned around, he\r\nobserved this person writing down the tag number of the car.\r\n\r\n2.    Chris Tipton\r\n\r\nChris Tipton8 testified that Wal-Mart contracted with an independent company to\r\nprovide security services to the store, and that company was responsible for those\r\nsecurity services. However, he acknowledged that, while on Wal-Mart premises,\r\nWal-Mart had a limited right to have the security company employee perform\r\nsome tasks, and Wal-Mart policy provided that the security company employee\r\ncould \"assist as requested.\" Tipton agreed that under Wal-Mart's loss prevention\r\npolicy, because Beckham did not take any merchandise out of the store, Wal-Mart\r\nwould not pursue a shoplifting prosecution against her, even though the law would\r\nhave allowed such. Tipton explained the reason behind the policy to be that Wal-\r\nMart wanted to give the customer the benefit of the doubt and did not want to\r\n\"cause any risk for anybody,\" and acknowledged consideration of the balance\r\nbetween the store not losing any merchandise in such a situation versus the risk\r\nattendant to apprehending a shoplifter. Tipton felt there was nothing wrong with\r\nCox asking Jones to obtain the tag number of Hancock's vehicle as she was\r\nattempting to leave the parking lot, if Jones could have done so while in the\r\nparking lot. He further testified he saw no evidence that any Wal-Mart employee\r\ndid anything in violation of Wal-Mart policies, and found no fault in the failure of\r\n\r\n8It is not clear from the record who Tipton is and what his relationship is to this\r\nmatter, but it appears he is a higher-level representative for Wal-Mart, with\r\nknowledge of employment matters and Wal-Mart policy.\r\n\nWal-Mart employees to tell Jones to stop and come back, stating he did not believe\r\nthe walkie-talkies range would have enabled them to do so, as they often had\r\nproblems with the walkie-talkies inside the store. Additionally, he noted that the\r\nwalkie-talkies only allowed one person to speak over them at a time.\r\n\r\n   II.    MOTION FOR DIRECTED VERDICT\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Roddey's case, Wal-Mart moved for a directed verdict\r\nasserting, among other things, that there was no negligence on the part of Wal-\r\nMart and there was no evidence any negligence on the part of Wal-Mart was the\r\nproximate cause of the accident. The trial court agreed, finding there was\r\n\"insufficient evidence that Wal-Mart was negligent, or even if there were, there\r\n[was a] lack of proximate cause [in] that the events were not foreseeable.\" The\r\ncourt therefore granted Wal-Mart's motion for directed verdict and dismissed Wal-\r\nMart from the lawsuit. The case proceeded against USSA and Jones, and the jury\r\nreturned a special verdict form finding defendants USSA and Jones negligent and\r\nthat their negligence proximately caused the injury, but likewise found Hancock\r\nnegligent and that her negligence was a proximate cause of the injury. Taking the\r\ncombined negligence that proximately caused the injury as one hundred percent,\r\nthe jury determined the defendants, USSA and Jones, were thirty-five percent\r\nnegligent, while Hancock was sixty-five percent negligent. The jury also\r\ndetermined USSA was negligent in hiring, training, supervision and retention, but\r\nfound this negligence was not the proximate cause of the injury. Because the jury\r\nfound Hancock's percentage on negligence to be greater than fifty percent, the jury\r\ndid not make a determination as to the amount of damages.\r\n\r\n   III.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"When upon a trial the case presents only questions of law the judge may direct a\r\nverdict.\" Rule 50(a), SCRCP. In ruling on a motion for directed verdict, a trial\r\ncourt must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party. S.C. Fed. Credit Union v. Higgins, 394 S.C.\r\n189, 193-94, 714 S.E.2d 550, 552 (2011). A trial court must deny a motion for\r\ndirected verdict where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its\r\ninference is in doubt. Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d\r\n642, 648 (2006). \"A motion for a directed verdict goes to the entire case and may\r\nbe granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability.\"\r\nHartfield v. Getaway Lounge & Grill, Inc., 388 S.C. 407, 415, 697 S.E.2d 558, 562\r\n(2010). The trial court should be concerned only with the existence or\r\n\nnonexistence of evidence, and not with the credibility or weight of the evidence.\r\nHiggins, 394 S.C. at 194, 714 S.E.2d at 552. Our standard of review likewise\r\nrequires this court to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty. Id.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, \"[t]he question of proximate cause ordinarily is one of fact for the\r\njury, and it may be resolved either by direct or circumstantial evidence.\" Madison\r\nex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 147, 638 S.E.2d 650, 662\r\n(2006). \"The trial judge's sole function regarding the issue is to inquire whether\r\nparticular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from\r\nthe evidence.\" Id.\r\n\r\n   IV.   RODDEY'S APPELLATE ARGUMENTS\r\n\r\nRoddey contends the trial court erred in granting Wal-Mart a directed verdict on\r\nthe issue of both negligence and proximate cause. He asserts there was evidence\r\npresented that Wal-Mart employees were negligent in bringing Jones into the\r\nencounter, instructing Jones to delay the women and obtain their license tag\r\nnumber, and instructing Jones to get the tag number after Jones warned the Wal-\r\nMart employees about their exit from the parking lot. Roddey further maintains\r\nthat a reasonable jury could find from the evidence presented that the accident\r\nwould not have occurred had Wal-Mart not given Jones those instructions, and that\r\na serious injury was a foreseeable consequence of Wal-Mart's request that Jones\r\nengage in this task. Specifically, Roddey notes there is evidence Wal-Mart\r\nbreached its duty of care by violating its own policies regarding who could pursue\r\na suspected shoplifter and under what circumstances the pursuit could begin and\r\nthose under which pursuit must be terminated. Additionally, Roddey notes there\r\nwas evidence of Wal-Mart's negligence in instructing Jones to continue to get the\r\nvehicle tag number even though it meant a vehicular pursuit on a public street.\r\n\r\nRoddey also argues there is evidence presented from which a reasonable jury could\r\ndetermine that Hancock's injury would not have occurred \"but for\" Wal-Mart's\r\nconduct in instructing and encouraging Jones in the pursuit. Further, Roddey\r\ncontends, given the evidence that Wal-Mart violated its restrictive policy and\r\nengaged Jones in the situation, Wal-Mart should have reasonably foreseen that\r\ninstructing Jones as it did would result in injury to a shoplifter or customer. He\r\npoints to evidence that (1) Wal-Mart gave Jones instructions causing him to drive\r\nthrough the Wal-Mart parking lot after someone who was running to get into a\r\nmoving vehicle, (2) Wal-Mart employees saw this unfold, instructed Jones to\r\n\ninteract with the women and failed to stop him, and (3) Wal-Mart instructed Jones\r\nto continue to get the tag number even though it meant a vehicular pursuit on the\r\npublic street. Roddey also notes this case is not one involving an independent,\r\nintervening act of a third party that broke the causal chain, and asserts the law\r\nprovides that if the acts of the intervening agency are a probable consequence of\r\nthe primary wrongdoer's actions, the primary wrongdoer is liable.\r\n\r\nLastly, Roddey asserts the trial court's error in granting Wal-Mart a directed verdict\r\nrequires a new trial, not just as to Wal-Mart, but as to USSA and Jones as well. He\r\nargues, under South Carolina's comparative negligence law, a plaintiff may only\r\nrecover damages in a negligence action if his or her negligence is not greater than\r\nthat of the defendant or the combined defendants, and the amount of a plaintiff's\r\nrecovery is reduced in proportion to his or her negligence. Because the jury only\r\nhad the opportunity to compare the negligence of Hancock to that of USSA and\r\nJones, Roddey argues the comparative negligence of Hancock may have been less\r\nthan that of the three defendants had Wal-Mart's negligence been considered, in\r\nwhich case recovery of damages would have been possible.\r\n\r\n   V.    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nNegligence and Proximate Cause\r\n\r\nAs to Judge Short's concurring opinion, I believe the issues of Wal-Mart's\r\nnegligence and proximate cause should have been submitted to the jury. Though\r\nthere is admittedly evidence from which a jury could find that Wal-Mart was not\r\nnegligent, or if it was, Wal-Mart's negligence was not reasonably foreseeable, I\r\nfind there is evidence from which a reasonable jury could determine that Wal-Mart\r\nwas negligent and that negligence proximately caused the injuries incurred. Thus,\r\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Roddey, the evidence yields more\r\nthan one inference, or its inferences are in doubt, and both matters should have\r\nbeen submitted to the jury.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must show that (1) the\r\ndefendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached that duty\r\nby a negligent act or omission, (3) the defendant's breach was the actual and\r\nproximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury or\r\ndamages. Madison, 371 S.C. at 135, 638 S.E.2d at 656. In the case at hand, the\r\ntrial court directed a verdict based upon its determination that there was\r\ninsufficient evidence of negligence on the part of Wal-Mart, and even if there were\r\n\nsufficient evidence of negligence, there was insufficient evidence that any such\r\nnegligence was the proximate cause of the accident, as the events were not\r\nforeseeable.\r\n\r\n1.    Negligence\r\n\r\nIn regard to negligence, our law provides that \"[t]he factfinder may consider\r\nrelevant standards of care from various sources in determining whether a defendant\r\nbreached a duty owed to an injured person in a negligence case.\" Id. at 140, 638\r\nS.E.2d at 659. \"The standard of care in a given case may be established and\r\ndefined by the common law, statutes, administrative regulations, industry\r\nstandards, or a defendant's own policies and guidelines.\" Id. Evidence of a\r\ncompany's deviation from their own internal policies is relevant to show the\r\ncompany deviated from that standard of care, and is properly admitted to show the\r\nelement of breach. Peterson v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 397, 618\r\nS.E.2d 903, 906 (2005). See also Caldwell v. K-Mart Corp., 306 S.C. 27, 31, 410\r\nS.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding K-Mart's loss prevention manual was\r\nrelevant on the material issue of the reasonableness of K-Mart's actions, noting, in\r\nnegligence cases, internal policies or self-imposed rules are often admissible as\r\nrelevant on the issue of failure to exercise due care). Relevant rules promulgated\r\nby a defendant company are admissible in evidence in a personal injury action,\r\nregardless of whether the rules were intended primarily for employee guidance,\r\npublic safety, or both, because violation of such rules may constitute evidence of a\r\nbreach of the duty of care and the proximate cause of injury. Madison, 371 at 141,\r\n638 S.E.2d at 659 (citing Tidwell v. Columbia Ry., Gas & Elec. Co., 109 S.C. 34,\r\n95 S.E. 109 (1918)).\r\n\r\nHere, viewed in the light most favorable to Roddey, there is evidence from which\r\nthe jury could determine that Wal-Mart employees violated their own policies by\r\ninstructing Jones to engage in actions prohibited by both their Guidelines for\r\nPrivate Security Contractors, as well as Wal-Mart's Investigation and Detention of\r\nShoplifters Policy for employees. While a jury could very well conclude, based\r\nupon the evidence presented, that Wal-Mart employees merely requested Jones\r\nspeak with Beckham and simply made a singular request for Jones to obtain the tag\r\nnumber of Hancock's vehicle while he was safely in a position to do so, and these\r\n\nactions were permitted by Wal-Mart's guidelines and policies,9 there was evidence\r\npresented from which a jury could also reasonably conclude Wal-Mart was\r\nnegligent in deviating from its guidelines and policies in this instance.\r\nSpecifically, Guidelines for Private Security Contractors prohibit the use of\r\ncontracted security guards as a policing force, and note it is the responsibility of\r\nWal-Mart management to enforce Wal-Mart policies and procedures. Further,\r\nthese guidelines provide that security contractors are precluded from pursuing\r\nsuspects, prohibit security contractors from using their vehicle in an attempt to\r\napprehend any suspects, and only allow the patrol vehicle to leave Wal-Mart\r\nproperty for obtaining gas or maintenance for the vehicle. Additionally, the\r\nInvestigation and Detention of Shoplifters Policy provides employees themselves\r\nare, at all times, prohibited from pursuing a fleeing suspect more than\r\napproximately 10 feet both inside and outside the facility, pursuing a suspect who\r\nis in a moving vehicle, pursuing a suspect off Wal-Mart's property, and using a\r\nmoving vehicle to pursue a suspect. Further, employees are directed to terminate\r\nthe pursuit of a suspect if the suspect begins to enter a vehicle. There is evidence\r\nfrom which a jury could reasonably conclude that Wal-Mart employees directed\r\nJones, on more than one occasion, to obtain Hancock's tag number, that they did so\r\nwhile observing Jones pursue Beckham and Hancock in his patrol vehicle, and they\r\nobserved the reckless driving of Hancock and Jones in the parking lot, yet they\r\ncontinued to instruct Jones to obtain the tag number after Jones warned, not just\r\nthat the women were leaving the parking lot, but that he and the women were\r\nleaving the parking lot. Thus, there is evidence from which a jury could\r\nreasonably conclude that Wal-Mart employees acquiesced in, and possibly\r\ninstructed, Jones' improper pursuit of the women in violation of the Private\r\nSecurity Contractors guidelines. Additionally, as noted by Roddey's expert\r\nwitness, Gross, there is evidence from which a jury could find Wal-Mart\r\nemployees instructed Jones to do something their policy strictly prohibited the\r\nemployees themselves from doing. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence of\r\nWal-Mart's negligence such that the matter was a question for the jury.\r\n\r\n2.    Proximate Cause\r\n\r\nIn order to prove proximate cause, a plaintiff is required to show both causation in\r\nfact and legal cause. Madison, 371 S.C. at 146, 638 S.E.2d at 662. Causation in\r\n\r\n9In particular, we note the guidelines provide the security contractor may act as a\r\nwitness, and is allowed to assist when directed to do so by a member of Wal-Mart\r\nmanagement or Loss Prevention.\r\n\nfact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred \"but for\" the\r\ndefendant's negligence, while legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.\r\nId. at 147, 638 S.E.2d at 662. \"Foreseeability is determined by looking to the\r\nnatural and probable consequences of the complained of act, although it is not\r\nnecessary to prove that a particular event or injury was foreseeable.\" Id. Further,\r\n\"[t]he defendant's negligence does not have to be the sole proximate cause of the\r\nplaintiff's injury; instead, the plaintiff must prove the defendant's negligence was at\r\nleast one of the proximate causes of the injury.\" Id.\r\n\r\n             Instead, it is sufficient if the evidence establishes that the\r\n             defendant's negligence is a concurring or a contributing\r\n             proximate cause. Concurring causes operate\r\n             contemporaneously to produce the injury, so that it would\r\n             not have happened in the absence of either. In other\r\n             words, if the actor's conduct is a substantial factor in the\r\n             harm to another, the fact that he neither foresaw nor\r\n             should have foreseen the extent of harm or the manner in\r\n             which it occurred does not negative his liability.\r\n\r\nJ.T. Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 369, 635 S.E.2d 97, 101 (2006)\r\n(citations, quotations, and emphasis in original omitted). An injury is considered\r\nforeseeable \"if it is the natural and probable consequence of a breach of duty.\"\r\nHurd v. Williamsburg Cnty., 363 S.C. 421, 428, 611 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2005).\r\n\r\nA primary wrongdoer's action \"is a legal cause of an injury if either the intervening\r\nact or the injury itself was foreseeable as a natural and probable consequence of\r\nthat action.\" Bramlette v. Charter-Med.-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 73, 393 S.E.2d\r\n914, 917 (1990). Though an intervening force may be a superseding cause that\r\nrelieves an actor from liability, in order for there to be relief from liability on this\r\nbasis, that intervening cause must be one that could not have been reasonably\r\nforeseen or anticipated. Rife v. Hitachi Const. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 217,\r\n609 S.E.2d 565, 569 (Ct. App. 2005). \"For an intervening act to break the causal\r\nlink and insulate the tortfeasor from further liability, the intervening act must be\r\nunforeseeable.\" Dixon v. Besco Eng'g, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 180, 463 S.E.2d 636,\r\n640 (Ct. App. 1995). \"The intervening negligence of a third person will not excuse\r\nthe first wrongdoer if such intervention ought to have been foreseen in the exercise\r\nof due care. In such case, the original negligence still remains active, and a\r\ncontributing cause of the injury.\" Bishop v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C.\r\n79, 89, 502 S.E.2d 78, 83 (1998). The test for determining if the negligent conduct\r\n\nof the original wrongdoer is to be insulated, as a matter of law, \"by the independent\r\nnegligent conduct of another is whether the intervening act and the injury resulting\r\ntherefrom are of such character that the author of the primary negligence should\r\nhave reasonably foreseen and anticipated them in light of the attendant\r\ncircumstances.\" Id. One is not charged with foreseeing that which is unpredictable\r\nor which could not be expected to happen, and, thus, when it appears the\r\nnegligence merely \"brought about a condition of affairs, or a situation in which\r\nanother and entirely independent and efficient agency intervenes to cause the\r\ninjury, the latter is to be deemed the direct or proximate cause, and the former only\r\nthe indirect or remote cause.\" Stone v. Bethea, 251 S.C. 157, 161-62, 161 S.E.2d\r\n171, 173 (1968) (emphasis added). The final result of a wrongful act, as well as\r\nevery intermediate cause, will be considered to be the proximate result of the first\r\nwrongful cause if intervening acts are set in motion by the original wrongful act\r\nand are normal and foreseeable results of the original act. Wallace v. Owens-\r\nIllinois, Inc., 300 S.C. 518, 521, 389 S.E.2d 155, 157 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\n\r\nHere, there was evidence presented that, despite Wal-Mart's knowledge of the\r\naggressive and reckless driving manners of Hancock and Jones and in spite of\r\nbeing advised both vehicles were leaving the property, Wal-Mart continued to\r\ninstruct Jones to obtain the tag number. Notably, Roddey's expert witness in the\r\narea of pursuit, Albert, testified concerning the effects of vehicular pursuit on those\r\nbeing pursued, and specifically opined that had Jones stayed in the parking lot and\r\nnot pursued Hancock's vehicle, it was highly unlikely the crash would have taken\r\nplace. Thus, there is evidence that \"but for\" these actions by Wal-Mart, the\r\naccident would not have occurred.\r\n\r\nWith respect to foreseeability, there was evidence presented that the accident was a\r\nforeseeable consequence of Wal-Mart's instructions to Jones, which were in\r\nviolation of Wal-Mart's established policies and guidelines, such that the matter\r\nshould have been submitted to the jury. As noted, there was evidence presented\r\nthat (1) Wal-Mart gave Jones instructions causing him to drive through the Wal-\r\nMart parking lot after Beckham, who then got into a moving vehicle, and Jones\r\nthen pursued Hancock's moving vehicle in his patrol car, (2) Wal-Mart employees\r\ndirected Jones, on more than one occasion, to obtain Hancock's tag number, while\r\nobserving Jones pursue Beckham and Hancock in his patrol vehicle, with both\r\nvehicles being operated in aggressive and/or reckless manners, and (3) Wal-Mart\r\ncontinued to instruct Jones to get the tag number even after Jones informed them\r\nthat he and the women were leaving the parking lot, thus encouraging a vehicular\r\npursuit on the public street. Additionally, Wal-Mart's Shoplifters Policy\r\n\nspecifically indicates that only certain authorized associates are allowed to\r\ninvestigate or detain a suspected shoplifter and may do so only in the presence of\r\nanother associate, and their policy emphasizes and reiterates that the authorized\r\nassociate must let the suspect go rather than continue a pursuit that is \"likely to\r\ninjure or cause harm to someone.\" Additionally, Roddey provided evidence,\r\nthrough expert testimony, that Wal-Mart had identified the results of \"doing certain\r\nthings,\" knew what could happen in such a situation, and as a result, adopted\r\npolicies against them. Accordingly, there is evidence that the accident was a\r\nnatural and probable consequence of Wal-Mart's negligent actions and therefore\r\nwas reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I do not believe, considered in a light most favorable to Roddey, that\r\nas a matter of law Jones' actions were independent intervening acts which could\r\nnot have been foreseen by Wal-Mart, or that Wal-Mart's acts were only a remote\r\ncause that did nothing more than furnish the condition or give rise to the occasion\r\nby which the injury was made possible, as there is evidence from which a jury\r\ncould reasonably conclude Jones' acts were not \"an entirely independent and\r\nefficient agency\" and were not \"a distinct, successive, unrelated and efficient cause\r\nof the injury.\" See Stone, 251 at 162, 161 S.E.2d at 173 (noting, when it appears\r\none's negligence merely brought about a condition of affairs, or a situation in\r\nwhich another and entirely independent and efficient agency intervenes to cause\r\nthe injury, the latter is to be deemed the direct or proximate cause, and the former\r\nonly the indirect or remote cause); Driggers v. City of Florence, 190 S.C. 309, 313,\r\n2 S.E.2d 790, 791 (1939) (\"A prior and remote cause cannot be made the basis of\r\nan action if such remote cause did nothing more than furnish the condition or give\r\nrise to the occasion by which the injury was made possible, if there intervened\r\nbetween such prior or remote cause and the injury a distinct, successive, unrelated\r\nand efficient cause of the injury, even though such injury would not have happened\r\nbut for such condition or occasion.\"). Clearly, there is evidence that any\r\nintervening acts of Jones were set in motion by the original wrongful acts of Wal-\r\nMart and were the normal and foreseeable results of the original act. Wallace, 300\r\nS.C. at 521, 389 S.E.2d at 157\r\n\r\nJury finding as to Hancock's negligence\r\n\r\nAs to Chief Judge Few's majority opinion, I do not believe that Wal-Mart's liability\r\nin this matter is strictly derivative of Jones' and/or USSA's liability such that the\r\njury's finding that Jones was only 35% at fault foreclosed any additional liability\r\non the part of Wal-Mart. While this may very well be true in regard to allegations\r\n\nof vicarious liability, as noted by Chief Judge Few, Roddey also alleged Wal-Mart\r\nwas liable based upon its failure to properly supervise Jones, and Wal-Mart's\r\nimproper advice or instruction to Jones to follow Hancock and obtain her license\r\ntag information. Thus, while a jury could very well find Hancock was still 65%\r\nnegligent after considering Wal-Mart's potential liability, it could conceivably find,\r\nafter factoring in any negligence by Wal-Mart, that Hancock was less than 50% at\r\nfault. I believe this is a question for the jury, and do not believe this court should\r\ninvade such province of the jury. Accordingly, I would reverse the directed verdict\r\nin favor of Wal-Mart and remand for a new trial as to Wal-Mart alone.10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 As to Roddey's assertion on appeal that the trial court's error in granting Wal-\r\nMart a directed verdict requires a new trial as to all of the respondents, I would\r\nfind Roddey has abandoned this issue on appeal and, additionally, we need not\r\nconsider the argument based on Roddey's failure to set forth the argument in his\r\nstatement of the issues on appeal. Though he cites law concerning the effect of a\r\njury finding of comparative negligence on a plaintiff's ultimate ability to collect\r\ndamages, he provides no supporting authority for his assertion that a court may\r\nrequire a new trial against defendants against whom a verdict has already been\r\nfound and who are not then held responsible for damages based upon the jury's\r\nfinding as to the relative percentages of negligence assigned to the various parties.\r\nBecause Roddey fails to cite law that would allow this court to grant a new trial\r\nagainst a defendant who has not received any type of favorable ruling that was in\r\nerror, I believe the argument is abandoned. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314\r\nS.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting when a party fails to cite\r\nauthority or when the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is\r\ndeemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal); Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container\r\nCorp., 355 S.C. 154, 164, 584 S.E.2d 390, 396 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"[S]hort,\r\nconclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned\r\non appeal and therefore not preserved for our review.\"). Additionally, Roddey\r\nfailed to set forth the argument in his statement of the issues on appeal. Therefore,\r\nthe court need not consider it. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no\r\npoint will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on\r\nappeal.\").\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
