Â Celeste became involved with Smith at some point, \r\n  and Smith moved in with Celeste in February 2000.Â  During the separation, Celeste \r\n  and Brad shared custody of the children, with Celeste having them during the \r\n  week and Brad having them every weekend.Â  On Friday afternoon, July 14, 2000, \r\n  Celeste phoned Brad and told him she and Smith were taking the children on a \r\n  trip to the beach.Â  The following Sunday night, Brad learned that Jordyn had \r\n  been injured.Â  Celeste told Brad they did not know what had happened to Jordyn.Â  \r\n  On Monday, July 17, 2000, Jordyn Durant died shortly after she was taken off \r\n  life support.Â  \r\nThe testimony at trial reveals that late \r\n  in the evening of July 14, Smith, Celeste, Taylor, and Jordyn checked into room \r\n  408 at the Days Inn Motel in Myrtle Beach.Â  Celeste told investigators that \r\n  the children awoke the next morning and watched cartoons for a little while, \r\n  and then they all dressed to go down to the beach.Â  After spending some time \r\n  on the beach, they went to the pool area.Â  Celeste noticed Jordyn had been acting \r\n  strangely that morning, and the child fell asleep in a float in the pool.Â  At \r\n  that point, she took Jordyn up to the room and attempted to feed her, but she \r\n  would not eat.Â  She gave Jordyn a bath and put her down for a nap around 12:30.Â  \r\n  When Jordyn woke up around 3:00 p.m., she was unsteady on her feet, could not \r\n  walk, and fell â€œflat on her face.â€Â  Celeste called her pediatrician in Florence, \r\n  who told her to take Jordyn to the local emergency room.Â  \r\nSmith and Celeste took Jordyn and Taylor \r\n  to Grand Strand Memorial Hospital, where Jordyn was examined by doctors.Â  Celeste \r\n  told investigators Jordyn was running a fever and the doctor was not sure what \r\n  was wrong with her.Â  After an x-ray, they found Jordyn had a skull fracture, \r\n  but they believed it was an old fracture.Â  After leaving the hospital, they \r\n  went to a pharmacy to get Jordyn some Dramamine, as prescribed by the doctor.Â  \r\n  They then went to get some pizza, but Jordyn again would not eat.Â  They went \r\n  back to the motel room and fell asleep.Â  They woke up the next morning around \r\n  8:00, and found Jordyn was difficult to wake up and was still unsteady on her \r\n  feet.Â  They checked out of their room around 10:30 that morning and went to \r\n  Broadway at the Beach and Ripleyâ€™s Aquarium and had lunch.Â  Jordyn stayed in \r\n  her stroller the whole time, mostly sleeping, and would not eat lunch.Â  They \r\n  went to one more place after lunch, and then headed back to Florence.Â  Celeste \r\n  indicated Jordyn slept the whole trip back, and she put the child in her bed \r\n  when they got home around 4:00 or 5:00 that afternoon.Â  When Celeste went to \r\n  check on Jordyn, she found blood coming from her mouth.Â  She called out to Smith, \r\n  who began to perform CPR on the child until EMS responded.Â  Celeste told investigators \r\n  Jordyn was never out of her sight while they were in Myrtle Beach and she was \r\n  never left alone with Smith or anyone else.Â  \r\nSmith similarly told an investigator that \r\n  the four arrived at the motel around 11:30 that Friday evening and checked into \r\n  room 408.Â  He indicated, they went down on the beach around 10:30 the next morning, \r\n  staying there for close to an hour before they went to the pool.Â  Jordyn fell \r\n  asleep in her float in the pool and they went upstairs, where Jordyn took a \r\n  nap.Â  After Jordyn woke up from her nap around 2:00 p.m., Smith took her out \r\n  of bed and stood her up, but when she took a step, she lost her balance and \r\n  fell forward on her face.Â  He attempted to stand her up again, but she could \r\n  not walk.Â  Smith told the investigator Jordyn experienced projectile vomiting, \r\n  which was dark in color.Â  Smith used the word â€œweâ€ when talking about their \r\n  activities that day, and never indicated a time when he and Celeste were not \r\n  together during the weekend trip.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAside from the time they stated Jordyn fell â€œflat \r\n  on her faceâ€ when she attempted to walk, both Celeste and Smith told investigators \r\n  that Jordyn had not fallen, she had not hit her head, and nothing had happened \r\n  to her.Â  \r\nDr. Orion Colfer treated Jordyn on July \r\n  15, 2000 when she came to the emergency room at Grand Strand Memorial Hospital.Â  \r\n  The child arrived at the emergency room at 4:45 vomiting and having difficulty \r\n  walking.Â  In the initial interview, Celeste did not mention an accident or fall.Â  \r\n  Dr. Colfer ordered a CAT scan, and the radiologist reported Jordyn appeared \r\n  to have an old skull fracture that did not show evidence of acute injury to \r\n  either the brain or the soft tissue at the site of the fracture.Â  Upon re-interview \r\n  of Celeste, she told Dr. Colfer that Jordyn had fallen at daycare at some point \r\n  in the past.Â  There were no signs of bruising or swelling to indicate a traumatic \r\n  injury.Â  Dr. Colfer asked a pediatrician to examine Jordyn, and it was the pediatricianâ€™s \r\n  opinion the child was suffering from a viral infection, possibly an ear infection \r\n  and vertigo, that was causing her difficulty walking and her fever.Â  \r\nWhen Jordyn was transported to Carolinas \r\n  Hospital System the evening of July 16, Dr. Carl John Chelen, a pediatric intensivist, \r\n  was paged.Â  At the time she arrived at the hospital, Jordyn was comatose, but \r\n  was still breathing and had a normal heart rate.Â  By the time Dr. Chelan arrived \r\n  fifteen to twenty minutes later, her condition had deteriorated to the point \r\n  that she was having difficulty breathing, and the emergency room physician had \r\n  to put a breathing tube in Jordyn.Â  Dr. Chelen accompanied Jordyn while another \r\n  CAT scan was performed.Â  About halfway thorough the scan, he observed evidence \r\n  of significant bleeding in Jordynâ€™s brain.Â  Dr. Chelen began treating Jordyn \r\n  for swelling in her brain and made immediate arrangements to transfer her to \r\n  McLeod Medical Center.Â  He testified there was a major difference between the \r\n  CAT scan taken the day before and the one taken that evening, in that the swelling \r\n  of the brain and bleeding into the brain were not evident in the CAT scan taken \r\n  at Grand Strand Memorial Hospital.Â  He further stated the difference in the \r\n  two scans helped determine when the injury occurred, because with a head injury, \r\n  if there is going to be internal bleeding, it normally occurs within twenty-four \r\n  to forty-eight hours, with more severe injuries showing bleeding earlier.Â  Based \r\n  on the onset of symptoms as well as the fact that there was a skull fracture \r\n  with no bleeding or brain swelling at the first CAT scan, he believed the injury \r\n  had occurred within several hours of the first scan.Â  \r\nOn Monday morning, July 17, 2000, Dr. \r\n  Gerald Atwood, the pediatric intensive care unit director at McLeod, assumed \r\n  responsibility for Jordyn.Â  Dr. Atwood testified Jordyn had sustained severe \r\n  neurological deficit.Â  Her CAT scans revealed she had a very large fracture \r\n  in the back of her head, and there was evidence of bleeding into the brain near \r\n  the fracture site as well as on the opposite side of the fracture.Â  Her brain \r\n  was markedly swollen and appeared to not be getting adequate blood supply.Â  \r\n  At that point, Jordyn had very severe brain damage.Â  The fracture left Jordyn \r\n  with a free-floating piece of bone in her skull, and the brain was so swollen \r\n  that it was pushing that piece of bone out, and part of her brain was pushed \r\n  out through the fracture site.Â  Dr. Atwood stated the swelling of her brain \r\n  was caused by some trauma she had sustained and it was suspected Jordyn was \r\n  also shaken, as evidenced by hemorrhaging of the blood vessels in her eyes that \r\n  is only seen in shaken baby syndrome.Â  He further testified the fracture was \r\n  located at the hardest part of the skull, it would take tremendous force to \r\n  cause that area to fracture, and because there were no external signs of a laceration, \r\n  indentation or bruising, something broad and flat, as opposed to sharp or thin, \r\n  would have caused this injury.Â  He stated that the reason the initial CAT scan \r\n  did not show evidence of bleeding and swelling in the brain even though the \r\n  fracture was there was that Jordynâ€™s brain was in a period of blood flow shutdown \r\n  at that time.Â  He thus determined the injury to Jordyn had to occur within a \r\n  few hours of the CAT scan taken in Myrtle Beach.Â  Dr. Atwood opined there was \r\n  no way Jordyn or her sister could have caused the injury to Jordyn, noting it \r\n  was not just a skull fracture, but there was also an injury from shaking, and \r\n  the shaking injury alone could have caused her to be brain dead.Â  He testified \r\n  that this was â€œunquestionably . . . [a case of] child abuse, this child was \r\n  shaken and this child received trauma to her head.â€Â  \r\nWhen Dr. Atwood met with Celeste and Brad and explained \r\n  their child would probably be declared brain dead, Celeste asked him how old \r\n  the skull fracture was.Â  Dr. Atwood told her that it could not be more than \r\n  a few days old and in his opinion it occurred at the same time as the traumatic \r\n  injury to the brain occurred, probably on that Saturday.Â  He emphasized to Celeste \r\n  that the time of injury was not the most important issue at that moment.Â  Celeste \r\n  asked Dr. Atwood for a second opinion.Â  Dr. Atwood thought she was referring \r\n  to the issue of Jordyn possibly being brain dead, but Celeste clarified she \r\n  wanted a second opinion as to the timing of the injury.Â  Two other doctors concurred \r\n  with Dr. Atwood.Â  Celeste told Dr. Atwood she opposed an autopsy of Jordyn, \r\n  but he informed her that was not her decision to make.Â  \r\nBecause it was a suspicious or unnatural death, \r\n  Dr. Clay Nichols performed an autopsy on Jordyn.Â  Dr. Nichols found a depressed \r\n  skull fracture, where part of the bone pressed into Jordynâ€™s brain.Â  He also \r\n  found another fracture on the left side of Jordynâ€™s skull.Â  The brain was very \r\n  swollen due to the injury.Â  Dr. Nichols testified the skull fracture could not \r\n  have been caused by a fall on the floor or by another young child pushing Jordyn, \r\n  and that her injuries were the end result of a severe beating with intentional \r\n  force applied to the back of her head.Â  Additionally, Dr. Nichols testified \r\n  the degree and severity of the injury to Jordyn would cause immediate neurological \r\n  problems which would be fairly obvious to an observer who had been around the \r\n  child.Â  He stated she died as a result of blows to her head as opposed to a \r\n  single blow, and â€œ[t]here were two fracture sites, plus also the pattern of \r\n  the bleeding . . . to the right side of the head . . . the back, the neck, the \r\n  shoulders, and the left side.â€Â  \r\nMargo Grant, the Days Inn housekeeper \r\n  who was responsible for cleaning room 408 at the time Smith and Celeste stayed \r\n  there, testified the occupants of that room did not want their room cleaned \r\n  during their stay.Â  She further testified that one particular morning when they \r\n  were having a lot of checkouts, her supervisor, Priscilla Flowers, noticed there \r\n  were no linens in room 408 and questioned her about it.Â  Ms. Grant had not stripped \r\n  the room.Â  When she went into the room, Ms. Grant found there were no sheets \r\n  or towels or bedspreads in the room.Â  Ms. Flowers likewise testified that on \r\n  July 16, 2000, she went to room 408 to strip it for Ms. Grant, but discovered \r\n  all linens except a spread and one sheet were missing.Â  She stated all the towels, \r\n  the other sheets, and the trash were gone from the room.Â  \r\nDuring the course of his investigation, Sergeant \r\n  Hancock went over to the home of Celeste and Smith.Â  When he went into Jordynâ€™s \r\n  room, he discovered the childâ€™s flat sheet was missing from the bed, as well \r\n  as the pillowcase from an apparently blood stained pillow.Â  When he inquired \r\n  about the pillowcase, Celeste went into another bedroom and returned to state \r\n  she could not find it.Â  When Hancock informed her it was important that they \r\n  find it, Celeste went over and whispered some communication with Smith.Â  Smith \r\n  then walked into the bedroom and came right back with the pillowcase.Â  Hancock \r\n  also testified that when he arrived at the hospital to investigate, he visually \r\n  inspected and photographed several bruises on JordynÂ  including some on her \r\n  collarbone, neck, shoulder, forearm and trunk.Â  The nurse indicated these would \r\n  not have been caused by medical treatment.Â  \r\nAt the start of the trial, a motion was made to \r\n  sever Celesteâ€™s trial from Smithâ€™s.Â  The trial court initially granted the motion \r\n  because Celeste had been charged under an additional indictment to the homicide \r\n  by child abuse and aiding and abetting, while Smith had not.Â  In response to \r\n  this ruling, the State dismissed the additional count against Celeste.Â  Because \r\n  the additional charge was no longer a concern, the trial court reversed its \r\n  earlier ruling and denied the motion to sever.Â  The trial of Smith and Celeste \r\n  then proceeded jointly.\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, both Smith and \r\n  Celeste moved for directed verdicts.Â  After some deliberation over the matter, \r\n  the trial judge denied the motions.Â  In doing so, she noted the evidence showed \r\n  the victim was with the defendants during the time frame the serious injury \r\n  occurred, the defendants were the only responsible adults dealing with the child \r\n  at that time, the evidence showed it was not an accident but was intentional, \r\n  the injury could not have been caused by another child, who was the only other \r\n  person present, and could not have been caused by the victim herself.Â  The judge \r\n  further noted that Smith, in particular, knew the victim had experienced projectile \r\n  vomiting, but this information was not relayed to medical personnel.Â  She also \r\n  found the missing linens were some evidence of an attempted cover-up of what \r\n  happened to Jordyn, and neither defendant told the medical personnel about the \r\n  serious injury that was inflicted on Jordyn even though they had an opportunity \r\n  to do so.Â  \r\nAfter a five-day trial, the jury convicted both \r\n  Smith and Celeste of homicide by child abuse and aiding and abetting homicide \r\n  by child abuse.Â  On October 10, 2001, the trial court sentenced Smith to twenty \r\n  years on each count.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in denying Appellantâ€™s motion \r\n  to sever?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in denying Appellantâ€™s motion \r\n  for directed verdict?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Separate Trials\r\nSmith argues the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in failing to sever his trial from that of Celeste.Â  Specifically, he contends \r\n  he was prejudiced by evidence presented by Celeste at trial through the testimony \r\n  of Dr. Susan Van Epps and Gail Mercuri, which put him in the position of having \r\n  to defend himself from both the State and Celeste.Â  We find no error.\r\nCriminal defendants who are jointly tried for murder \r\n  are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right.Â  State v. Nichols, \r\n  325 S.C. 111, 122, 481 S.E.2d 118, 124 (1997).Â  A motion for severance is addressed \r\n  to the discretion of the trial court and the courtâ€™s ruling should not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Id.Â  Further, â€œ[t]he general \r\n  rule allowing joint trials applies with equal force when a defendantâ€™s severance \r\n  motion is based upon the likelihood he and a codefendant will present mutually \r\n  antagonistic defenses, i.e., accuse one another of committing the crime.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 281, 523 S.E.2d 173, 176 (1999).Â  To successfully \r\n  challenge the trial courtâ€™s exercise of discretion in denying a motion to sever, \r\n  the defendant must demonstrate some prejudice resulting from the joint trial.Â  \r\n  State v. Thompson, 279 S.C. 405, 408, 308 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1983).\r\nWe first note, although it is clear that a motion \r\n  for severance was made by Celesteâ€™s attorney, the record does not show that \r\n  the motion was joined in or individually made by Smith.Â  Further, even if Smith \r\n  did move for severance, there is no evidence he requested severance based on \r\n  the issue he now raises on appeal.Â  Finally, the issues presented in the record \r\n  by Celesteâ€™s attorney were that of the additional indictment of Celeste and \r\n  the possible inconsistency of statements.Â  Because the record does not reflect \r\n  that the issue raised by Smith on appeal was raised to the court below, it is \r\n  questionable whether this issue is properly before us on appeal.Â  See \r\n  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997) (issue \r\n  may not be raised for first time on appeal, but must have been raised to trial \r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nAt any rate, Smithâ€™s argument fails for two reasons.Â  \r\n  First, the general rule allowing joint trials is not impugned simply because \r\n  the codefendants may present evidence accusing each other of the crime.Â  Dennis, \r\n  337 S.C. at 281, 523 S.E.2d at 176.Â  Second, Smith failed to include the testimony \r\n  of the two witnesses of which he complains in the record on appeal. Thus, this \r\n  Court is unable to discern any prejudice.Â  See State v. Mitchell, \r\n  330 S.C. 189, 194, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1998) (the burden is on appellant to \r\n  provide a sufficient record for review);Â  Thompson, 279 S.C. at 408, \r\n  308 S.E.2d at 366 (for reversal, a defendant tried jointly must show prejudice).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to sever the trials.\r\nII.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nSmith also asserts the trial court erred \r\n  in denying his motion for directed verdict as the evidence was insufficient \r\n  to support his convictions.Â  He contends there was insufficient substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence presented by the State to allow the case to go to the \r\n  jury, and his mere presence at the scene was insufficient to prove his guilt \r\n  as a principal or as an aider or abettor.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, this court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State, and if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find \r\n  that the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 \r\n  S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998).Â  In ruling on a directed verdict motion, \r\n  the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  If the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove \r\n  the defendantâ€™s guilt or from which his guilt could be fairly and logically \r\n  deduced, the trial court must send the case to the jury.Â  State v. Jarrell, \r\n  350 S.C. 90, 97, 564 S.E.2d 362, 366 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This court may reverse \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is \r\n  no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Lindsey, 355 \r\n  S.C. 15, 20, 583 S.E.2d 740, 742 (2003).Â Â Â  \r\nThe State charged Smith with homicide by child \r\n  abuse and aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.Â  These crimes are codified \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nA person is guilty of homicide by child abuse if the person:\r\n  \r\n(1) causes the death of a child under the age of eleven while \r\n  committing child abuse or neglect, and the death occurs under circumstances \r\n  manifesting an extreme indifference to human life; or\r\n(2) knowingly aids and abets another person to commit child \r\n  abuse or neglect, and the child abuse or neglect results in the death of a child \r\n  under the age of eleven.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A) (2003).Â  â€œChild abuse \r\n  or neglectâ€ is defined under the statute as â€œan act or omission by any \r\n  person which causes harm to the childâ€™s physical health or welfare.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(1) (2003) (emphasis added).Â  Further, the statute provides \r\n  that one causes harm to a childâ€™s physical health or welfare when one â€œinflicts \r\n  or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical injury, including injuries \r\n  sustained as a result of excessive corporal punishment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(2)(a) \r\n  (2003) (emphasis added).Â  â€œAid and abetâ€ has been defined as â€œ[h]elp, assist, \r\n  or facilitate the commission of a crime, promote the accomplishment thereof, \r\n  help in advancing or bringing it about, or encourage, counsel, or incite as \r\n  to its commission.â€ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 68 (6th ed. 1990).Â  â€œIt \r\n  comprehends all assistance rendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, \r\n  or presence, actual or constructive, to render assistance if necessary.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe evidence adduced at trial indicated \r\n  Jordyn sustained her devastating injury on Saturday, July 15, and that it had \r\n  to have occurred within several hours of her first CAT scan at Grand Strand \r\n  Memorial Hospital.Â  During this time period, Smith and Celeste were the only \r\n  two persons with Jordyn who could have possibly caused her injury.Â  Celeste \r\n  told investigators she was with Jordyn the whole time and, in his statement \r\n  to investigators, Smith referred to all of their actions that day as â€œwe,â€ never \r\n  indicating a time when he and Celeste were not together during that weekend. \r\n\r\nThe medical testimony also revealed that Jordyn did \r\n  not suffer from a single skull fracture, but that she had two distinct fracture \r\n  sites, and she suffered from more than one blow to her head.Â  Further, there \r\n  was evidence that Jordyn also suffered from shaken baby syndrome, which alone \r\n  was enough to cause her to become brain dead.Â  There was evidence presented \r\n  that the injury to Jordyn was severe and would cause immediate neurological \r\n  problems which would have been fairly obvious to Smith and Celeste.Â  More importantly, \r\n  Dr. Nichols stated her injuries were the end result of a severe beating with \r\n  intentional force applied to the back of her head, and Dr. Atwood testified \r\n  that the injury was unquestionably the result of child abuse.\r\nThe statute makes clear that child abuse may be committed \r\n  by either an act or an omission which causes harm to a childâ€™s physical \r\n  health.Â  S.C.

Jahue Moore and M. Ronald McMahan, Jr., both of West Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this breach of contract \r\n  action, WDI Meredith &amp; Company asserts the trial court erred in ruling American \r\n  Telesis was not bound to an agreement signed by the companyâ€™s vice president.Â  \r\n  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nHusband and wife Steven and Monica Hesling each owned \r\n  half the shares of American Telesis, a wholesale telecommunications firm.Â  Monica \r\n  was the companyâ€™s president and treasurer and Steven served as secretary and \r\n  vice president of marketing.Â  While Steven and Monica were in the midst of a \r\n  â€œtough separation,â€ they agreed she would spend very little or no time at the \r\n  office, and he would be at the office running the business.Â  During this time, \r\n  Steven met with Jack Meredith, the sole proprietor of WDI, a company in the \r\n  business of â€œ[i]dentifying, structuring, and negotiating mergers and acquisitions \r\n  of middle market companies.â€Â  On numerous occasions the two discussed the process \r\n  of selling American Telesis.Â  \r\nAt Meredithâ€™s request, Steven signed a document \r\n  entitled â€œExclusive Investment Banking and Consulting Agreement.â€Â  In the agreement, \r\n  American Telesis retained WDI to provide consulting services for a variety of \r\n  business endeavors including finding a purchaser for the company.Â  In return \r\n  for WDIâ€™s services, American Telesis agreed to pay WDI a monthly fee of $1500 \r\n  as well as a $1500 retainer.Â  Additionally, if an entity located by WDI purchased \r\n  American Telesis, the agreement entitled WDI to a scaled percentage of the total \r\n  consideration.Â  The agreement also established a minimum fee:Â  â€œIn any event, \r\n  the total fee to be paid to Consultant at closing shall not be less than $100,000.00.â€Â  \r\n  The agreement also provided WDI would be entitled to half of any back-out penalty \r\n  received by American Telesis if a potential purchaser backed out of a deal:\r\n\r\nAny back-out penalty, settlement or other similar termination \r\n  consideration paid to Client by a third party shall be divided equally between \r\n  Client and Consultant. Such amount shall not exceed Consultants [sic] minimum \r\n  fee.\r\n\r\nAccording to Meredith, WDI began working under \r\n  the agreementâ€™s terms immediately after Steven signed the document.Â  This included \r\n  mailing letters to several potential buyers.Â  WDI received a number of positive \r\n  responses from the mailing, including a response from Atlantic Tele-Network \r\n  (ATN).Â  \r\nAt the time the agreement was entered into, Meredith \r\n  knew Steven was keeping his plans to sell the corporation a secret from his \r\n  estranged wife. Â Monica first learned of the agreement later when she \r\n  and Steven attempted to reconcile.Â  Before Monica learned of the agreement, \r\n  WDI received some of the monthly consulting fees.Â  Although Steven testified \r\n  three American Telesis checks were delivered to WDI, Meredith contends he received \r\n  only two $1500 payments.Â  Steven testified he was able to make the payments \r\n  without Monicaâ€™s knowledge because both he and Monica had signature authority \r\n  on corporate checks.Â  After seeing the agreement, Monica indicated neither she \r\n  nor the corporation agreed to its terms.Â  However, according to the testimony \r\n  of both Meredith and Monica, Meredith consulted with Monica and Monica assisted \r\n  Meredith in providing financial information to a prospective purchaser.Â  \r\nThereafter, on September 8, 1998, Monica wrote \r\n  a letter to WDI stating American Telesis was terminating the agreement and instructing \r\n  WDI to discontinue any work being done on behalf of American Telesis. Â Shortly \r\n  after Monica sent the letter to WDI, Monica, Steven, and their transactional \r\n  attorney began working on the structure and agreement for the sale of the business \r\n  to ATN.Â  On November 13, 1998, the two companies signed a letter of intent to \r\n  sell the assets of American Telesis to ATN.Â  The letter of intent contained \r\n  no provision denominated a back-out penalty or termination fee.Â  When ATN later \r\n  refused to complete the transaction, American Telesis filed suit.Â  The lawsuit \r\n  was eventually settled with ATN paying $42,500 to American Telesis.Â  \r\nWDI then brought this action against American Telesis \r\n  for breach of contract, asserting it was entitled to unpaid monthly consulting \r\n  fees and half of the settlement from ATN.Â  The case was referred to a \r\n  master, who dismissed the complaint after a hearing, concluding Stevenâ€™s signature \r\n  did not bind American Telesis to the agreement.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWDI contends the trial court erred in determining \r\n  Steven lacked authority to bind American Telesis to the agreement with WDI.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nAgency may be implied or inferred and may be circumstantially \r\n  proven by the conduct of the purported agent exhibiting a pretense of authority \r\n  with the knowledge of the alleged principal.Â  Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 \r\n  S.C. 140, 143, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982).Â  Under the doctrine of apparent authority, \r\n  a principal is bound by its agentâ€™s acts â€œwhen it has placed the agent in such \r\n  a position that persons of ordinary prudence, reasonably knowledgeable with \r\n  business usages and customs, are led to believe the agent has certain authority \r\n  and they in turn deal with the agent based on that assumption.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 143, 293 S.E.2d at 426 (1982).Â  A principal creates apparent authority as \r\n  to a third person by the principalâ€™s written or spoken words or any other conduct \r\n  which, â€œreasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe the principal \r\n  consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act \r\n  for him.â€Â  Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, \r\n  142, 399 S.E.2d 430, 433 (Ct. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by \r\n  Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  868 (2000). Â Either the principal must intend to cause the third person to believe \r\n  the agent is authorized to act for him, or he should realize his conduct is \r\n  likely to create such belief.Â  An agency may not, however, be established solely \r\n  by the declarations and conduct of an alleged agent.Â  Id. at 142-43, \r\n  399 S.E.2d at 433.Â  \r\nAmerican Telesis correctly notes Steven could not \r\n  have bound the corporation to a sale of its assets.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-12-102 \r\n  (1990).Â  However, the agreement executed by Steven is not for the sale of the \r\n  corporationâ€™s assets.Â  It is essentially a contract for the purchase of consulting \r\n  and marketing services designed, if successful, to result in a contract for \r\n  the sale of the corporation or its assets.Â  American Telesis endowed Steven \r\n  with the title of vice president of marketing, a position calculated to lead \r\n  people of ordinary prudence with reasonable knowledge of business usages to \r\n  conclude that he had the authority to enter into such contracts on behalf of \r\n  the corporation.Â  Additionally, Stevenâ€™s authority on such regular business \r\n  matters would be a natural consequence of the corporationâ€™s size:Â  American \r\n  Telesis had only two shareholders, two officers, and two members of the board \r\n  of directors.Â  In organizations of this size, officers routinely have the authority \r\n  to enter into day-to-day transactions.Â  Indeed, Steven had signing authority \r\n  on checks written on corporate accounts and, at the time of the signing of the \r\n  agreement, Steven was the sole individual managing the affairs of the corporation, \r\n  with Monica spending little or no time at the office.Â  It is reasonable for \r\n  a business person to believe that the individual in charge of the day-to-day \r\n  operations of a corporation, in the absence and to the exclusion of other principals, \r\n  is vested with authority to bind the corporation to the contract in question.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, American Telesis is bound by the contract Steven signed with WDI.\r\nWe now turn to the relief WDI seeks.Â  As to monthly \r\n  fees, we conclude WDI is entitled to payments for the period between mid-April, \r\n  when the agreement was signed, and mid-November 1998, when the letter of intent \r\n  was entered into with ATN.Â  However, because the testimony at trial conflicted \r\n  as to whether two or three payments had been made, we remand for the trial court \r\n  to determine what amount American Telesis actually paid to WDI and thus the \r\n  monthly fees still due WDI.Â  \r\nWDI also claims it is entitled to half the amount \r\n  recovered from ATN based on its withdrawal from the transaction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nAs the plaintiff, WDI had the burden of establishing \r\n  its entitlement to a portion of the settlement American Telesis reached \r\n  with ATN.Â  Although the agreement provided WDI was to receive half of any â€œback-out \r\n  penalty, settlement or other similar termination considerationâ€ paid to American \r\n  Telesis, it did not define the term back-out penalty.Â  No South Carolina case \r\n  or statutory provision has been cited to us which defines the term, nor have \r\n  we been successful in locating a definition in South Carolina jurisprudence.Â  \r\n  As the drafter of the contract, WDI was in the best position to prevent confusion \r\n  in the contractâ€™s construction and should be the party to suffer from its shortcomings.Â  \r\n  See Williams v. Teran, Inc., 266 S.C. 55, 60, 221 S.E.2d 526, \r\n  529 (1976) (noting an ambiguity in an agreement must be resolved against its \r\n  drafter).Â  Additionally, although the provision states WDI is entitled to half \r\n  of any settlement, we conclude it envisioned a voluntary settlement as a natural \r\n  consequence of any buyerâ€™s decision to walk away from a planned deal.Â  However, \r\n  the letter of intent between ATN and American Telesis did not provide for any \r\n  back-out penalty and rather than a natural event of a failed purchase, the settlement \r\n  came only after American Telesis filed suit.Â  Because the agreement between \r\n  WDI and American Telesis does not define back-out penalty, and the testimony \r\n  in the record is that the letter of intent which was the subject of the lawsuit \r\n  did not contain a provision for a back-out penalty or termination fee, WDI has \r\n  not met its burden of proof of showing that a settlement of a lawsuit constitutes \r\n  a back-out penalty within the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement \r\n  was entered into.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3806","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  and Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Warren B. Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Aaron Mathis was convicted \r\n  of attempted criminal sexual conduct in the second degree with a minor and incest.Â  \r\n  The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole for the criminal \r\n  sexual conduct charge and ten years, concurrent, for the incest charge.Â  Mathis \r\n  appeals his convictions, contending: (1) his prosecution was barred by the Double \r\n  Jeopardy Clause of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions; (2) the \r\n  trial judge erred by admitting evidence of Mathisâ€™s prior bad acts; and (3) \r\n  the trial judge erred by admitting certain DNA evidence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis action arises out of allegations \r\n  that Mathis sexually abused his fourteen-year-old niece (the victim).Â  In September \r\n  of 2000, the victim and her mother traveled from their home in Durham, North \r\n  Carolina, to spend the Labor Day weekend at the victimâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s house \r\n  in Columbia.Â  On Labor Day afternoon, they had a cookout for family and friends \r\n  in the area.Â  Mathis arrived at the house later in the evening.\r\nThe victim testified Mathis made several inappropriate \r\n  advances on her that night.Â  On one occasion, shortly after Mathis arrived, \r\n  he grabbed the victim and propositioned her for sex.Â  He offered her money, \r\n  saying â€œIâ€™m going to give you the money for those boots [you want].â€Â  Mathis \r\n  assured the victim that she had â€œnothing to worry aboutâ€ because he had a condom, \r\n  so he would not get her pregnant.Â  This advance was forestalled, however, when \r\n  one of the victimâ€™s aunts entered the room where Mathis had approached the victim.\r\nLater that evening, the victim fell asleep while \r\n  she was watching television alone in one of the bedrooms.Â  The victim declared \r\n  Mathis assaulted her while she was sleeping: â€œI woke up because I felt [Mathis] \r\n  was in the room.Â  He was in the room, and I felt him trying to insert his penis \r\n  in me, so I woke up. . . . [I]t hurt real bad.â€Â  Mathis left the house around \r\n  4:00 a.m.Â  The victim returned to North Carolina without telling anyone in her \r\n  family what occurred.\r\nIn January, the victim discovered she \r\n  was pregnant.Â  When her mother asked how it happened, the victim told her about \r\n  the September 2000 incident with Mathis.Â  The victim and her mother immediately \r\n  traveled to Columbia and reported the conduct to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department.Â  Mathis was subsequently arrested and charged with incest and attempted \r\n  criminal sexual conduct in the second degree with a minor.\r\nSerological and DNA Evidence Collected\r\nAfter reporting the conduct to the Sheriffâ€™s Department, \r\n  the victim and her mother traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, to have an abortion \r\n  performed.Â  As is required procedure in cases of alleged rape, an investigator \r\n  employed by the Sheriffâ€™s Department was present at the abortion clinic to take \r\n  fetal tissue samples and blood samples for use as evidence in the investigation.Â  \r\n  The Sheriffâ€™s Department investigator testified he received the fetal tissue \r\n  and two vials of blood.Â  The investigator was not present when the blood was \r\n  drawn, but he was informed by the clinic staff that one vial contained the victimâ€™s \r\n  blood and the other vial contained blood drawn from the umbilical cord.Â  The \r\n  investigator further stated he packaged the fetal tissue and blood samples and \r\n  delivered them to an evidence technician at the State Law Enforcement Division \r\n  (SLED) headquarters in Columbia.\r\nThereafter, Special Agent Steve Lambert, \r\n  a DNA analyst and serologist assigned to the forensic laboratory at SLED, transferred \r\n  Mathisâ€™s blood from its vial to sterile cotton cloth so that it could be properly \r\n  frozen and stored for later analysis.Â  Lambert subsequently packaged the victimâ€™s \r\n  blood sample, Mathisâ€™s blood sample, and the fetal tissue in separate heat-sealed \r\n  pouches and placed them in a Styrofoam container.Â  He sent the package by Federal \r\n  Express to a laboratory in Dallas, Texas, for DNA analysis.\r\nAmber Moss, a forensic scientist at the \r\n  Dallas laboratory, professed she received an unopened, sealed package from Steve \r\n  Lambert at SLED containing blood samples from the victim and Mathis and the \r\n  fetal tissue.Â  Moss reported:\r\n\r\nMy results were that Aaron Mathis could not be excluded as \r\n  the biological father of the fetal sample.Â  The probability of paternity is \r\n  ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent, as compared to an untested random number \r\n  of the . . . North American population. . . . Aaron Mathis is 1,252,078 times \r\n  more likely to be the father of the fetal sample as a random tested individual.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the State introduced evidence of the \r\n  DNA test results.Â  The Solicitor, however, was unable to show a complete chain \r\n  of custody for the blood samples taken from the victim at the Atlanta abortion \r\n  clinic because no witness could testify regarding who actually drew the blood \r\n  samples.Â  Mathis moved for a mistrial, which the trial court granted.Â  The case \r\n  was retried the following month over Mathisâ€™s objection that retrial was barred \r\n  under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.Â  \r\n  At the second trial, the State presented evidence of the identity of the person \r\n  who drew the victimâ€™s blood at the abortion clinic, thus curing the defect that \r\n  resulted in the initial mistrial.\r\nPrior Attempted Sexual Conduct\r\nThe victim testified that Labor Day 2000 \r\n  was not the first time Mathis attempted to sexually assault her.Â  She claimed \r\n  it happened on three previous occasions.Â  The first incident occurred in November \r\n  of 1999 after a Thanksgiving family gathering at her auntâ€™s home in Mauldin, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  According to the victim, Mathis began rubbing the back of her \r\n  thighs while she was watching television.Â  He continued harassing the victim \r\n  after the rest of the family went to bedâ€”including trying to unbutton her pants, \r\n  grabbing her hand and trying to put it into his pants, and continuing to rub \r\n  her inappropriately.Â  The victim declared Mathis attempted to cajole her acquiescence \r\n  to his advances by offering to pay for a pair of boots she wanted for Christmas.\r\nThe second incident occurred on approximately \r\n  January 16, 2000, again at the home of the victimâ€™s aunt in Mauldin.Â  The victim \r\n  stated she was lying on a bed alone in her cousinâ€™s bedroom.Â  Mathis physically \r\n  approached the victim and â€œstarted grinding on [her] from behind, like rubbing \r\n  his penis up against [her] butt.â€Â  As before, Mathis promised to give the victim \r\n  money to purchase boots she wanted and offered her some jewelry he was wearing.\r\nThe third incident occurred around Easter \r\n  weekend in April of 2000, at a family cookout at the victimâ€™s great-grandmotherâ€™s \r\n  home in Greenwood, South Carolina.Â  Similar to the two prior incidents, the \r\n  victim claimed Mathis grabbed her and started â€œgrindingâ€ on her and touched \r\n  her inappropriately.Â  According to the victim, Mathisâ€™s advances became more \r\n  severe than before:\r\n\r\nHe came and he got on top of \r\n  me, and he was like touching me and stuff.Â  And he was trying to pull my pants \r\n  down again, but I grabbed them . . . .Â  And he started like touching me with \r\n  his finger. . . .Â  In my vagina.Â  And he was like, â€œWell, Iâ€™ve got to get me \r\n  some of this.â€Â  And he said, â€œYou let other boys have some.Â  Why canâ€™t I have \r\n  some, too?â€Â  And he was like touching me, and he pulled his pants down.Â  And \r\n  he was like trying to have sex with me, but my pants, they were like around \r\n  my â€“ they were at my knees, so he couldnâ€™t get close enough to me.\r\n\r\nThe victim was ultimately able to push Mathis away \r\n  before anything further happened.Â  This incident in April of 2000 was the last \r\n  time the victim saw Mathis before the conduct on Labor Day of 2000, which is \r\n  the basis of the current proceeding.\r\nAt trial, Mathis objected to the admission \r\n  of the testimony regarding the allegations of these uncharged prior bad acts \r\n  as being unfairly prejudicial and prohibited under State v. Lyle, 125 \r\n  S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), and Rule 404(b), SCRE, which prohibits the admission \r\n  of evidence of prior bad acts to prove the character of a person in order to \r\n  show action in conformity therewith.Â  The trial court allowed the testimony \r\n  under the exception to that rule for evidence of prior bad acts that tends to \r\n  establish a common scheme or plan.\r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nI.Â  Double Jeopardy\r\nMathis argues the Circuit Court erred when it allowed \r\n  the second trial to proceed because the Stateâ€™s failure at the first trial to \r\n  present a witness to establish the chain of custody for the victimâ€™s blood samples \r\n  was intended to provoke the defense into moving for a mistrial, and therefore, \r\n  the second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States \r\n  and South Carolina Constitutions protect citizens from being placed twice in \r\n  jeopardy of life or liberty.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. V (â€œNo person shall \r\n  be . . . subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or \r\n  limb . . . .â€); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12 (â€œNo person shall be subject for the \r\n  same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or liberty . . . .â€); see \r\n  also State v. Cuccia, 353 S.C. 430, 434, 578 S.E.2d 45, 47 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (â€œBoth the United States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  protect against double jeopardy.â€).Â  The guarantee against double jeopardy has \r\n  been said to consist of three separate constitutional protections.Â  Cuccia, \r\n  353 S.C. at 434, 578 S.E.2d at 47.Â  Under the Double Jeopardy Clause, a defendant \r\n  is protected from (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; \r\n  (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple \r\n  prosecution for the same offense after an improvidently granted mistrial.Â  State \r\n  v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 588 S.E.2d 105 (2003); State v. Kirby, 269 \r\n  S.C. 25, 236 S.E.2d 33 (1977); see also United States v. Dinitz, \r\n  424 U.S. 600, 606 (1976) (â€œThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment \r\n  protects a criminal defendant from repeated prosecutions for the same offense.â€) \r\n  (footnote omitted).Â  Generally, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn and \r\n  impaneled, unless the defendant consents to the juryâ€™s discharge before it reaches \r\n  a verdict or legal necessity mandates the juryâ€™s discharge.Â  State v. Baum, \r\n  355 S.C. 209, 584 S.E.2d 419 (Ct. App. 2003), petition for cert. filed; \r\n  State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 539 S.E.2d 717 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nMathis cites State v. Rowlands \r\n  and State v. Baum in regard to the applicability of the Double Jeopardy \r\n  Clause after an improvidently granted mistrial.Â  Rowlands and Baum \r\n  are factually and legally inapposite to the case sub judice.Â  \r\n  The gravamen of Rowlands and Baum is the improvident grant of \r\n  a mistrial; whereas, here, the court justifiably granted a mistrial on motion \r\n  emanating from the defendant.\r\nMathis claims that, although a defendantâ€™s motion \r\n  for mistrial ordinarily removes any barrier to a retrial, the Solicitorâ€™s conduct \r\n  in the present case falls within the exception defined by the United States \r\n  Supreme Court in Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982).Â  In Kennedy, \r\n  the defendant in a state court criminal case moved for and received a mistrial \r\n  because of improper prosecutorial questioning of an expert witness.Â  Id. \r\n  at 669.Â  When the State attempted to retry him, the defendant moved to dismiss \r\n  the charges on double jeopardy grounds.Â  The trial court found as a fact that \r\n  â€œâ€˜it was not the intention of the prosecutor in this case to cause a mistrial.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  On the basis of this finding, the trial court held that double jeopardy \r\n  principles did not bar retrial, and Kennedy was then tried and convicted.Â  Id. \r\n  at 670.\r\nThe Oregon Court of Appeals decided the Double \r\n  Jeopardy Clause barred Kennedyâ€™s retrial after his first trial ended in a mistrial \r\n  granted on his own motion.Â  Id. at 669.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded \r\n  that retrial was barred because the prosecutorial misconduct that occasioned \r\n  the mistrial in the first instance amounted to â€œâ€˜overreaching.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The United States Supreme Court reversed, declaring that prosecutorial misconduct \r\n  or harassment adequate to warrant a mistrial on defendantâ€™s motion is not by \r\n  itself sufficient to raise the bar of double jeopardy.Â  Id. at 675-76.\r\nThe Supreme Court inculcated:\r\n\r\nOur cases . . . have indicated that even where the defendant \r\n  moves for a mistrial, there is a narrow exception to the rule that the Double \r\n  Jeopardy Clause is no bar to retrial. . . . .\r\nSince one of the principal threads making up the protection \r\n  embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause is the right of the defendant to have \r\n  his trial completed before the first jury impaneled to try him, it may be wondered \r\n  as a matter of original inquiry why the defendantâ€™s election to terminate the \r\n  first trial by his own motion should not be deemed a renunciation of that right \r\n  for all purposes.Â  We have recognized, however, that there would be great difficulty \r\n  in applying such a rule where the prosecutorâ€™s actions giving rise to the motion \r\n  for mistrial were done â€œin order to goad the [defendant] into requesting a mistrial.â€ \r\n  . . . In United States v. Dinitz, [424 U.S.] at 611, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 267 [(1976)], we said:\r\n  \r\nâ€œThe Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against \r\n  governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject \r\n  defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions.â€\r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nProsecutorial conduct that might be viewed as harassment \r\n  or overreaching, even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on defendantâ€™s motion, \r\n  therefore, does not bar retrial absent intent on the part of the prosecutor \r\n  to subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.Â  A defendantâ€™s \r\n  motion for a mistrial constitutes â€œa deliberate election on his part to forgo \r\n  his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first \r\n  trier of fact.â€Â  Where prosecutorial error even of a degree sufficient to warrant \r\n  a mistrial has occurred, â€œ[t]he important consideration, for purposes of the \r\n  Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the \r\n  course to be followed in the event of such error.â€Â  Only where the governmental \r\n  conduct in question is intended to â€œgoadâ€ the defendant into moving for a mistrial \r\n  may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having \r\n  succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.\r\n  \r\n&nbsp;. . . .\r\n  \r\nWe do not by this opinion lay down a flat rule that where \r\n  a defendant in a criminal trial successfully moves for a mistrial, he may not \r\n  thereafter invoke the bar of double jeopardy against a second trial.Â  But we \r\n  do hold that the circumstances under which such a defendant may invoke the bar \r\n  of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases \r\n  in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was \r\n  intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\r\n\r\nId. at 673-79 (citations omitted and footnote \r\n  omitted).\r\nThus, the Kennedy Court adopted a rule providing \r\n  that a defendant who has moved for and been granted a mistrial may successfully \r\n  invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent a second prosecution only when \r\n  the prosecutorâ€™s conduct giving rise to the mistrial was intended to â€œgoadâ€ \r\n  or provoke him into moving for the mistrial.Â  Id. at 673.Â  Under this \r\n  standard, the determination depends upon whether prosecutorial misconduct was \r\n  undertaken with the specific intent â€œto subvert the protections afforded by \r\n  the Double Jeopardy Clause.â€Â  Id. at 676; see also Gilliam \r\n  v. Foster, 75 F.3d 881 (4th Cir. 1996) (stating that when defendant seeks \r\n  or consents to grant of mistrial, there is no bar to his later retrial; this \r\n  proposition is subject to an exception when defendant establishes his request \r\n  for mistrial was motivated by prosecutorial or judicial misconduct that was \r\n  intended to provoke defendant into moving for a mistrial).\r\nâ€œKennedy emphasized that intent to provoke a \r\n  mistrial, rather than mere prosecutorial overreaching, is necessary to render \r\n  meaningless a defendantâ€™s motion for a mistrial.â€Â  United States v. Johnson, \r\n  55 F.3d 976, 978 (4th Cir. 1995).Â  A â€œcourtâ€™s finding concerning the prosecutorâ€™s \r\n  intent is . . . a factual one which we must accept unless it is clearly erroneous.â€Â  \r\n  United States v. Borromeo, 954 F.2d 245, 247 (4th Cir. 1992); see \r\n  also United States v. Council, 973 F.2d 251, 254 (4th Cir. 1992) \r\n  (â€œDeference should be given to the trial court in determining whether such an \r\n  intent existed.â€); United States v. Wentz, 800 F.2d 1325, 1327 (4th Cir. \r\n  1986) (noting the question of prosecutorial provocation is one of fact on which \r\n  the findings of the trial court may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous).\r\nUnder the rule outlined in Kennedy, the \r\n  instant case implicates no double jeopardy concerns.Â  This Court does NOT \r\n  condone in any way the Solicitorâ€™s failure to diligently prepare the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case against the accused by reviewing the evidence in advance of trial to ensure \r\n  a proper foundation was laid for all the evidence it planned to present.Â  This \r\n  Court has concernment in regard to the sloppy preparation by the State in reference \r\n  to the chain of custody rule.Â  We admonish Solicitors in South Carolina to respond \r\n  with vivacity in the preparation and presentation of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  We are \r\n  not happy with the factual scenario encapsulated in this case involving the \r\n  conduct of the litigation by the Solicitor.\r\nThe Solicitorâ€™s neglect did NOT rise to \r\n  the level of â€œgoadingâ€ or â€œprovokingâ€ Mathis to move for a mistrial.Â  The evidentiary \r\n  record does NOT reveal any specific intent on the part of the Solicitor \r\n  â€œto subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.â€Â  The trial \r\n  judge ruled: â€œIâ€™ve pondered this from the standpoint of trying to determine \r\n  whether or not this would be prosecutorial misconduct.Â  I donâ€™t think it rises \r\n  to that level. . . . [I]t was nothing intentional on their part.â€Â  The record \r\n  is devoid of any evidence of intent by the State to withhold evidence establishing \r\n  the chain of custody or otherwise prompt the mistrial.Â  Accordingly, although \r\n  the Solicitor failed to properly prepare the case by establishing a complete \r\n  chain of custody for the blood evidence, the trial court correctly ruled the \r\n  retrial was not barred.\r\nII.Â  Evidence of Prior Misconduct\r\nMathis maintains the trial court erred \r\n  in admitting evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct allegedly committed by \r\n  Mathis on the victim three times prior to the Labor Day 2000 incident for which \r\n  he was tried.Â  He asserts the evidence does not fall within any of the exceptions \r\n  to the general ban on evidence of an accusedâ€™s other bad acts.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes \r\n  evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s \r\n  guilt for the crime charged.Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d \r\n  646 (Ct. App 2004); see also State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 679 (2000) (finding that evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is inadmissible \r\n  to prove bad character of defendant or that he acted in conformity therewith).Â  \r\n  Such evidence is admissible, however, when it tends to establish (1) motive; \r\n  (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan \r\n  embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that \r\n  proof of one tends to establish the proof of the other; or (5) the identity \r\n  of the person charged with the present crime.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. \r\n  Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923); see also Anderson v. \r\n  State, 354 S.C. 431, 581 S.E.2d 834 (2003) (explaining that Rule 404, the \r\n  modern expression of the Lyle rule, excludes evidence of other crimes, \r\n  wrongs, or acts offered to prove character of person in order to show action \r\n  in conformity therewith; the rule creates an exception when testimony is offered \r\n  to show motive, identity, existence of common scheme or plan, absence of mistake \r\n  or accident, or intent).\r\nIf not the subject of a conviction, a prior bad \r\n  act must first be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Beck, \r\n  342 S.C. at 135, 536 S.E.2d at 683.Â  The record must support a logical relevance \r\n  between the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant is accused.Â  \r\n  State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001).Â  The decision \r\n  to admit contested evidence is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  â€œIf there \r\n  is any evidence to support the admission of the bad act evidence, the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  at 829.\r\nIn the present case, the trial judge admitted \r\n  the evidence of Mathisâ€™s prior alleged sexual misconduct under the common scheme \r\n  or plan exception to Rule 404(b), SCRE, and Lyle.Â  â€œA close degree of \r\n  similarity or connection between the prior bad act and the crime for which the \r\n  defendant is on trial is required to support admissibility under the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception.â€Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 546, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001).Â  The connection between the prior bad act and the crime \r\n  must be more than just a general similarity.Â  State v. Timmons, 327 S.C. \r\n  48, 488 S.E.2d 323 (1997).Â  â€œA common scheme or plan concerns more than the \r\n  commission of two similar crimes; some connection between the crimes is necessary.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 52, 488 S.E.2d at 325; see also State v. Ford, 334 \r\n  S.C. 444, 513 S.E.2d 385 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating that the common scheme or \r\n  plan exception requires not just similarity of the other acts to the crime charged, \r\n  but also a close relationship between the crimes); State v. Moultrie, \r\n  316 S.C. 547, 554, 451 S.E.2d 34, 39 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œClear and convincing \r\n  evidence of prior crimes or bad acts that is logically relevant is . . . admissible \r\n  to prove . . . a common scheme or plan that embraces several previous crimes \r\n  so closely related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other.â€).\r\nIn deciding whether to admit evidence of prior \r\n  bad acts, courts must weigh the probative value of evidence of prior bad acts \r\n  against its prejudicial effect.Â  State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 323 \r\n  S.E.2d 772 (1984).Â  Where the evidence of the bad acts is so similar to the \r\n  charged offense that the previous act enhances the probative value of the evidence \r\n  so as to outweigh its prejudicial effect, it is admissible.Â  State v. Weaverling, \r\n  337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, even if the evidence \r\n  is clear and convincing and falls within a Lyle exception, the trial \r\n  judge must exclude it if its probative value is substantially outweighed by \r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id.Â  Thus, â€œ[s]uch \r\n  evidence is inadmissible â€˜unless the close similarity of the charged offense \r\n  and the previous act[s] enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to \r\n  overrule the prejudicial effect.â€™â€Â  McClellan, 283 S.C. at 392, 323 S.E.2d \r\n  at 774.\r\nIn State v. Weaverling, this Court \r\n  applied the common scheme or plan exception in a case involving allegations \r\n  of criminal sexual conduct.Â  Id. at 471, 523 S.E.2d 792-93.Â  In that \r\n  case, the Court found â€œ[t]he common scheme or plan exception â€˜is generally applied \r\n  in cases involving sexual crimes, where evidence of acts prior and subsequent \r\n  to the act charged in the indictment is held admissible as tending to show continued \r\n  illicit intercourse between the same parties.â€™â€Â  Id. at 469, 523 \r\n  S.E.2d at 791 (quoting State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 265, 89 S.E.2d \r\n  701, 711 (1955)) (emphasis added).Â  In Weaverling, the defendant allegedly \r\n  sexually abused the same victim in the same manner almost every time the two \r\n  were together for a period of five or six years.Â  The victim testified that \r\n  he had been assaulted by the defendant in excess of one hundred times.Â  We held \r\n  the defendantâ€™s pattern of continuous sexual abuse satisfied the common scheme \r\n  or plan exception.Â  Id. at 471, 523 S.E.2d at 792-93.\r\nState v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  186 (Ct. App. 2003), explicates that cases involving criminal sexual conduct \r\n  often entail the admission of past conduct evidence to show a common scheme \r\n  or plan:\r\n\r\nWe interpret [State v. Weaverling, \r\n  337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999) and State v. McClellan, \r\n  283 S.C. 389, 323 S.E.2d 772 (1984)] to suggest that common scheme or plan evidence \r\n  in criminal sexual conduct cases will be admitted on a generalized basis only \r\n  where there is a pattern of continuous illicit conduct.Â  Sex crimes may be unique \r\n  in this respect because they commonly involve the same victims engaged in repeated \r\n  incidents occurring under very similar circumstances.Â  The reason for the general \r\n  admissibility of such evidence under these circumstances is self evidentâ€”where \r\n  there is a pattern of continuous conduct shown, that pattern clearly supports \r\n  the inference of the existence of a common scheme or plan, thus bolstering the \r\n  probability that the charged act occurred in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nId. at 328, 580 S.E.2d at 191.\r\nIn the present case, the evidence of the \r\n  alleged prior bad acts reveals a close degree of similarity to the facts of \r\n  the crime charged.Â  The evidence demonstrates by clear and convincing proof \r\n  the occurrence of the prior bad acts.Â  The three earlier assaults on the victim \r\n  were all attempted in the same manner and under similar circumstances.Â  On each \r\n  occasion, Mathis approached the victim while she was alone at family gatherings.Â  \r\n  He would touch her in largely the same suggestive, inappropriate manner each \r\n  time, and he would then attempt to entice her to have sex with him.Â  During \r\n  at least two of the three prior incidents, Mathis accompanied his improper advances \r\n  with offers of giftsâ€”just as he did during the incident for which he was charged.Â  \r\n  Overall, the three prior incidents of sexual misconduct by Mathis show the same \r\n  illicit conduct with the victim over the course of the nine months prior to \r\n  September 2000.Â  Concomitantly, we conclude the probative value of the evidence \r\n  regarding Mathisâ€™s prior bad acts clearly outweighs the prejudicial effect of \r\n  admitting the evidence.\r\nIII.Â  Admissibility of DNA Evidence\r\nMathis contends the \r\n  trial court erred by admitting evidence of the DNA test results prepared by \r\n  the testing laboratory in Dallas, Texas, because the chain of custody for the \r\n  blood samples and fetal tissue was not properly established.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Mathis argues the chain is incomplete because the whereabouts of the vial of \r\n  blood taken from the umbilical cord are unknown.Â  Amber Moss, a forensic scientist \r\n  at the Dallas laboratory, testified she received only the fetal tissue and blood \r\n  stains from the victim and Mathis.Our Supreme Court addressed the chain \r\n  of custody rule in State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 544 S.E.2d 835 (2001).Â  \r\n  In that case, blood and saliva samples were collected from the defendant for \r\n  testing.Â  The samples were placed in a sealed container.Â  After being handled \r\n  by several people, the container was opened by a SLED agent, who found the saliva \r\n  sample was missing.Â  The defendant objected that the chain of custody for his \r\n  blood sample, which provided the necessary evidence for the DNA match, was defective.Â  \r\n  He claimed the fact that the kit did not contain a saliva sample when it was \r\n  broken open by the SLED agent indicated a break in the chain of custody.Â  The \r\n  trial judge found there was nothing to indicate the integrity of the blood samples \r\n  themselves had been compromised and admitted the evidence.\r\nThe Supreme Court articulated:\r\n\r\nThe State must prove a chain of custody for a blood sample \r\n  from the time it is drawn until it is tested.Â  State v. Smith, 326 S.C. \r\n  39, 482 S.E.2d 777 (1997).Â  A complete chain of evidence must be established \r\n  as far as practicable, tracing possession from the time the specimen is taken \r\n  from the human body to the final custodian by whom it is analyzed.Â  State \r\n  v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, 426 S.E.2d 306 (1992); Raino v. Goodyear Tire \r\n  and Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 422 S.E.2d 98 (1992); State v. Kahan, \r\n  268 S.C. 240, 233 S.E.2d 293 (1977) (citing Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. \r\n  26, 100 S.E.2d 534 (1957)).Â  Proof of chain of custody need not negate all possibility \r\n  of tampering so long as the chain of possession is complete.Â  State v. Williams, \r\n  301 S.C. 369, 392 S.E.2d 181 (1990).\r\n\r\nId. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837.Â  The Court \r\n  discussed the application of the chain of custody rule:\r\n\r\nIn applying this rule, we have \r\n  found evidence inadmissible only where there is a missing link in the chain \r\n  of possession because the identity of those who handled the blood was not established \r\n  at least as far as practicable.Â  On the other hand, where the identity of \r\n  persons handling the specimen is established, we have found evidence regarding \r\n  its care goes only to the weight of the specimen as credible evidence.Â  In other \r\n  words, where there is a weak link in the chain of custody, as opposed to a missing \r\n  link, the question is only one of credibility and not admissibility.\r\n\r\nId. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837 (emphasis added \r\n  and citations omitted).\r\nThe Carter Court found no missing \r\n  link in the chain of custody.Â  The Court concluded â€œthe evidence of a discrepancy \r\n  in the contents of the kit does not render the blood sample inadmissible but \r\n  goes only to its weight as credible evidence.â€Â  Id. at 425, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  at 838.\r\nIn the retrial of the case at bar, the identity of all persons \r\n  handling the blood samples was clearly established.Â  As in Carter, the \r\n  State proved a continuous chain of custody through the testimony of all people \r\n  who had control and possession of the evidence.Â  The persons who handled the \r\n  evidence testified at trial.\r\nThere is no missing link in the chain of custody.Â  The discrepancy \r\n  in this case only involves a weak link and raises a question of credibility, \r\n  not admissibility.Â  The trial judge did not err in admitting evidence of the \r\n  DNA test results.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Mathisâ€™s second trial was not barred under \r\n  the principle of double jeopardy.Â  Evidence of Mathisâ€™s prior bad acts and the \r\n  DNA evidence were properly admitted.Â  The rulings of the Circuit Court are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3807","title":"RoTec Services, Inc. v.

App. 1998).Â  \r\n  In reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the \r\n  same standard which governs the trial court.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; \r\n  Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  â€œIn determining \r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.â€ Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, \r\n  332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract Accompanied by a \r\n  Fraudulent Act\r\nEncompass first argues the trial \r\n  court erred by dismissing its claim for breach of contract accompanied by a \r\n  fraudulent act.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo maintain an action for breach \r\n  of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, a plaintiff must prove three elements: \r\n  â€œ(1) a breach of contract; (2) fraudulent intent relating to the breaching of \r\n  the contract and not merely to its making; and (3) a fraudulent act accompanying \r\n  the breach.â€ Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 465-66, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 606, 612 (2002).Â  â€œFraudulent actâ€ is broadly defined as â€œany act characterized \r\n  by dishonesty in fact or unfair dealing.â€ Id. at 466, 560 S.E.2d at 612.Â  \r\n  Here, Encompass has failed to allege any facts which would tend to prove Rotec \r\n  committed a fraudulent act accompanying its alleged breach of contract.\r\nEncompass alleges that, prior \r\n  to the execution of the contract, Rotec promised it would not represent Encompassâ€™s \r\n  competitor, Turbine Consultants.Â  Rotec acknowledged that it continued to represent \r\n  Turbine Consultants during the time its contract with Encompass was in force, \r\n  but denied ever promising Encompass that it would cease representing Turbine \r\n  Consultants.Â  Encompass argues that it was â€œinferableâ€ from Rotecâ€™s alleged \r\n  promise that it intentionally concealed its continued representation of Turbine \r\n  Consultants throughout the duration of its contract with Encompass.\r\nEven when viewing the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to Encompass, as we must, more is required than \r\n  mere speculation.Â  See Strother, 332 S.C. at 61, 504 S.E.2d at \r\n  121.Â  Encompass has failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact to show \r\n  that Rotec ever did anything to deny or hide its continuing work for Turbine \r\n  Consultants.Â  Indeed, the evidence contained in the record before us is to the \r\n  contrary.Â  Encompassâ€™s president, Richard Bryant, testified that the matter \r\n  of Rotecâ€™s representation of Turbine Consultants was never discussed after the \r\n  parties entered into the contract, and that he did not follow up on or ask Repaire \r\n  to confirm that he had left Turbine Consultants.Â  Encompassâ€™s sales manager, \r\n  Richard Riley, testified that he never knew whether Rotec represented Turbine \r\n  Consultant and Encompass at the same time.\r\nAccordingly, we find there was \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rotecâ€™s alleged breach of contract \r\n  was accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  The trial courtâ€™s dismissal of that claim \r\n  was appropriate.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith \r\n  and Fair Dealing\r\nEncompass next argues the trial \r\n  court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Rotec on its claim for \r\n  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Rotec asserts \r\n  there is no separate cause of action for breach of this implied covenant because \r\n  it is subsumed under the claim for breach of contract.Â  We agree with Rotec.\r\nOur courts have not addressed \r\n  this precise question of whether an independent cause of action may be maintained \r\n  for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Our sister \r\n  court in Georgia, however, has recently confronted this issue.Â  In Stuart \r\n  Enters. Intâ€™l, Inc. v. Peykan, Inc., 555 S.E.2d 881 (Ga. Ct. App. 2001), \r\n  the buyer of a business sued the seller, asserting separate causes of action \r\n  for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing.Â  The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled that separate claims were \r\n  not proper, opining that â€œ[t]he implied covenant of good faith modifies, and \r\n  becomes part of, the provisions of the contract itself.Â  As such, the covenant \r\n  is not independent of the contract.â€Â  Id. at 884.Â  The holding of the \r\n  Georgia Court of Appeals is in accord with the law of other jurisdictions that \r\n  have addressed this question.Â  See Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. O.R. \r\n  Concepts, Inc., 69 F.3d 785, 792 (7th Cir. 1995) (holding â€œunder \r\n  Illinois law the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not an independent \r\n  source of duties for the parties to a contractâ€); Cambeeâ€™s Furniture, Inc. \r\n  v. Doughboy Recreational, Inc., 825 F.2d 167, 175 (8th Cir. 1987) (holding \r\n  the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not state a claim distinct \r\n  from the breach of contract claim); Designers N. Carpet, Inc. v. Mohawk Indus., \r\n  Inc., 153 F.Supp.2d 193, 196 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (â€œA claim for breach of an \r\n  implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not provide a cause of \r\n  action that is separate and different from a breach of contract claim.Â  Rather, \r\n  breach of that duty is merely a breach of the underlying contract.â€ (internal \r\n  citation omitted)).\r\nThough South Carolina courts \r\n  have not directly addressed this exact question, we do have precedent strongly \r\n  suggesting there is no separate cause of action for the implied covenant of \r\n  good faith and fair dealing.Â  This court, in Boddie-Noell Props., Inc. v. \r\n  42 Magnolia Pâ€™ship, 344 S.C. 474, 485, 544 S.E.2d 279, 285 (Ct. App. 2000), \r\n  affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision to send the breach of contract claim to \r\n  the jury, in part, for breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair \r\n  dealing.Â  When appealed to the supreme court, the supreme court also treated \r\n  the implied covenant of good faith as merely another term of the contract at \r\n  issue, concluding that â€œ[the defendant] breached the express provisions of the \r\n  purchase agreement as well as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.â€Â  \r\n  Boddie-Noell Props., Inc. v. 42 Magnolia Pâ€™ship, 352 S.C. 437, 444, 574 \r\n  S.E.2d 726, 730 (2002).Â  Similarly, in Parker v. Byrd, 309 S.C. 189, \r\n  194, 420 S.E.2d 850, 853 (1992), the supreme court found that the partiesâ€™ express \r\n  agreement to act in good faith was merely a restatement of the covenant of good \r\n  faith implied in every contract.Â  \r\nTherefore, we conclude that the implied covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing is not an independent cause of action separate \r\n  from the claim for breach of contract.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s dismissal of this claim.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Dismissal of the Privilege Defense\r\nEncompass next argues the trial \r\n  court erred in striking its defense of privilege as insufficiently pled.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nRule 8(b), SCRCP, requires that \r\n  a defendant provide a statement â€œin short and plain terms [of] the facts constituting \r\n  his defenses to each cause of action asserted.â€Â  The Rule further mandates that \r\n  a pleading contain â€œultimate factsâ€ rather than â€œevidentiary factsâ€ to state \r\n  a cause of action.Â  Watts v. Metro Sec. Agency, 346 S.C. 235, 240, 550 \r\n  S.E.2d 869, 871 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œUltimate facts fall somewhere between the \r\n  verbosity of evidentiary facts and the sparsity of â€˜legal conclusions.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The trial courtâ€™s decision to strike a defense as insufficiently pled will not \r\n  be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Slack v. James, 356 S.C. \r\n  479, 482, 589 S.E.2d 772, 774 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIn asserting the defense of privilege, \r\n  Encompassâ€™s allegation in its answer reads in its entirety: â€œDefendant pleads \r\n  the affirmative defense of privilege.â€Â  This statement alone is purely a legal \r\n  conclusion and clearly falls below the standard mandated by Rule 8.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s striking this defense. [1] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nWe find no error with the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of Rotec on Encompassâ€™s claims \r\n  for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act and breach of the implied \r\n  covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Nor do we find the trial court abused \r\n  its discretion in striking Encompassâ€™s defense of privilege.Â  The trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order is therefore \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] \r\n    Though Rotecâ€™s motion was styled as one for â€œPartial Judgment on the Pleadings \r\n    and for Partial Summary Judgment,â€ the trial court dismissed all of the claims \r\n    at issue in this appeal on grant of summary judgment alone.Â  This discrepancy \r\n    does not affect our analysis as insufficient pleading was also the only argument \r\n    raised by Rotec on the privilege issue in its memorandum in support of the \r\n    motion.Â  It can be readily inferred, therefore, that the trial court ruled \r\n    on this issue based on the arguments raised before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3808","title":"Wynn v.

Dixon Lee, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nW. D. Yarborough, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  David Wynn appeals from the \r\n  family courtâ€™s equitable division award and its decision to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to Harriet Wynn.Â  We affirm as modified below.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married on November 5, 1983, \r\n  separated on January 22, 1999, and divorced on March 28, 2002.Â  At trial, Wife \r\n  sought an equitable division of Husbandâ€™s family-owned heating and air conditioning \r\n  business, J.L. Wynn &amp; Sons, Inc.Â  The business was sold back to Husbandâ€™s \r\n  father prior to the initiation of this action in exchange for $4,902.76 and \r\n  cancellation of a note owed by the business to the father.Â  Upon learning of \r\n  this sale, Wife joined the father as a party to determine ownership of the business.Â  \r\n  In a separate proceeding, the family court determined that the father was currently \r\n  the sole owner of the business and that eighty-seven percent of the business \r\n  value at the time of sale was marital property (Order of Judge Timothy Brown, \r\n  dated July 12, 2001).Â  Husband and Wife claimed substantially different values \r\n  for the business, and the family court adopted Wifeâ€™s marital interest valuation \r\n  of $145,000.Â  In dividing the marital estate, the family court credited to Husband \r\n  the $145,000 of marital interest in the business even though he only received \r\n  $4,902.76 in cash for the sale.Â  Including that credit for the business, Husbandâ€™s \r\n  portion of the marital estate totaled $215,775.Â  Wife received assets totaling \r\n  $152,648.50.Â  Finally, the family court awarded Wife $30,000 for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.\r\nHusband asserts that the family courtâ€™s valuation of \r\n  the business was excessive, which resulted in an inequitable distribution of \r\n  the marital estate.Â  Husbandâ€™s second argument is that the family court erred \r\n  in excluding from the marital estate debt from a jointly held credit card.Â  \r\n  Building on these two claims of error, Husband also seeks reversal of the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees award.\r\nThe Family Business\r\nAt the time of the marriage, \r\n  Husband owned a portion of J.L. Wynn &amp; Sons, Inc. along with his father \r\n  and his three siblings.Â  Husbandâ€™s father, James Wynn, owned fifty-one percent \r\n  of the company shares.Â  Husband and his two brothers each owned thirteen percent \r\n  of the company and Husbandâ€™s sister owned ten percent. \r\nIn December 1993, the shareholders decided \r\n  to turn over full ownership of the company to Husband.Â  To accomplish this, \r\n  Husbandâ€™s father and his sibling shareholders entered into a stock purchase \r\n  agreement with the company. Â Under the agreement, the company was obliged \r\n  to purchase all of the outstanding shares of stock not held by Husband, leaving \r\n  Husband as the sole shareholder of the business.Â Â  The four exiting shareholders \r\n  were paid for their shares with interest-bearing promissory notes payable in \r\n  monthly installments.Â  For example, the company issued Husbandâ€™s father a note \r\n  promising to pay him $190,418.70 for his fifty-one percent interest in the business. \r\n\r\nThe exiting shareholders, however, \r\n  did not entirely relinquish their rights to ownership.Â  Under the terms of the \r\n  agreement, the selling shareholders were granted a security interest in the \r\n  shares they had redeemed allowing them to retake ownership and possession of \r\n  the stock in the event of default or non-performance by the company.Â  The agreement \r\n  also provided that the selling shareholders could resume ownership of their \r\n  shares in the event Husband voluntarily or involuntarily sold, pledged, transferred, \r\n  or alienated his shares in the company. \r\nFollowing the consummation of \r\n  the stock purchase agreement in late 1993, Husband took control of the business.Â  \r\n  He handled all operations of the company and ensured the payments on the notes \r\n  to the former shareholders were kept current.Â  This arrangement continued without \r\n  incident until early 1999.Â  Shortly after Husband separated from Wife in January \r\n  of that year but before bringing this divorce action, Husband sold the business \r\n  back to his father.Â  \r\nWife learned of this conveyance \r\n  during the course of the divorce proceedings.Â  By way of cross-complaint, she \r\n  later joined the father as a party to the action to determine what ownership \r\n  interest the father might have in the company, which Wife asserted was marital \r\n  property.Â  Husbandâ€™s father answered Wifeâ€™s cross-complaint by denying the company \r\n  was marital property subject to equitable distribution. \r\nThe case was bifurcated so that \r\n  Wifeâ€™s action to determine ownership of the company could be heard separately.Â  \r\n  After declaring the company to be the sole property of Husbandâ€™s father, the \r\n  family court also found that eighty-seven percent of the business was marital \r\n  property.Â  In its July 2001 order, the family court stated:\r\n\r\nThe total number of shares owned \r\n  by the corporation is 1,000 of which 130 were owned by the husband prior to \r\n  marriage.Â  The husband acquired ownership of the entire corporation by acquiring \r\n  the remaining 870 shares during the marriage.Â  Therefore, 87% of the corporation \r\n  is marital property.Â  Whatever value should be given that 87% is reserved for \r\n  the trial judge.Â  \r\n\r\nIn its determination of equitable distribution \r\n  in the final divorce decree entered in March 2002, the family court strictly \r\n  adhered to the finding entered by the previous judge regarding the treatment \r\n  of the company as marital property: â€œWith regard to the value of eighty-seven \r\n  percent (87%) of J.L. Wynn &amp; Sonâ€™s Inc., this Court is following the determination \r\n  by the Order of Judge Brown . . . in which Judge Brown found this portion of \r\n  the corporation to be marital property.â€Â Â  The family court considered the reports \r\n  and testimony of experts for Husband and Wife regarding the value of the marital \r\n  interest in the company.Â  Husband claimed the value was merely $4,902.76, which \r\n  was the amount paid by his father in the repurchase.Â  The court found Wifeâ€™s \r\n  valuation was supported by sound data and methodology while Husbandâ€™s valuation \r\n  was not.Â  Accordingly, the family court adopted Wifeâ€™s suggested valuation of \r\n  $145,000 for the marital interest in the company.Â  The family court assessed \r\n  the marital estate at $368,423.52, of which Husband should receive fifty-five \r\n  percent.Â  In addition to receiving credit for the marital interest in the company, \r\n  Husband was credited for a previous $50,000 loan repayment by the company that \r\n  was marital property for which Husband could not account.Â  Likewise, Husband \r\n  was credited for $3,000 of marital funds that he removed from the childrenâ€™s \r\n  savings account.Â  Wife received the marital home and other assets valued at \r\n  $152,648.50.\r\nDisputed Credit Card Debt\r\nAt the final hearing, Husband \r\n  argued that an outstanding balance of $3,526 accrued on a Visa credit card should \r\n  be included in the marital estate for equitable division.Â  In support of his \r\n  claim, Husband introduced into evidence a copy of the credit card account statement \r\n  dated August 6, 1999, as well as credit card receipts bearing Wifeâ€™s signature \r\n  for several purchases made prior to the partiesâ€™ separation. \r\nIn its final order, the family \r\n  court omitted any mention of the credit card debt.Â  Husband timely filed a Rule \r\n  59(e) motion, specifically requesting that the court rule on whether the credit \r\n  card balance should be included as a marital asset for equitable distribution.Â Â Â  \r\n  The court denied the motion, but, again, did not address the credit card debt \r\n  in its order.Â  Husband now appeals the family courtâ€™s implicit exclusion of \r\n  this debt from the estate.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the trial court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, \r\n  477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the trial judge, who saw \r\n  and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  McAlister v. Patterson, \r\n  278 S.C. 481, 483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982).\r\nThe family court has broad discretion in determining \r\n  how marital property is to be valued and distributed. Murphy v. Murphy, \r\n  319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995). The family court may use â€œany reasonable \r\n  means to divide the property equitably,â€ and its judgment will only be disturbed \r\n  where abuse of discretion is found. Id. at 329, 461 S.E.2d at 41-42.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Valuation of the Family Business\r\nHusband argues the family court \r\n  erred in valuing the 87 percent marital interest in J.L. Wynn &amp; Sons, Inc., \r\n  at $145,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband does not contest the \r\n  family courtâ€™s first order which determined that eighty-seven percent of the \r\n  value of the company should be included in the marital estate.Â  Husbandâ€™s appeal \r\n  only takes issue with the value assigned to that portion by the family court \r\n  in its final order.\r\nHusband asserts the value of \r\n  the company should be $4,902.76, the amount he received when he sold the company \r\n  back to his father in January 1999.Â  The reason, Husband argues, is that he \r\n  was â€œlegally obligatedâ€ and â€œforcedâ€ to sell the company for this amount under \r\n  the terms of the 1993 stock purchase agreement.Â  In support of this position, \r\n  Husband relies on our decision in McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, \r\n  506 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In that case, the court found a stock purchase \r\n  agreement was â€œthe most probative evidence of the value of [Appellantâ€™s] interestâ€ \r\n  in a medical practice that was considered a marital asset. Id. at 594, \r\n  506 S.E.2d at 6.Â  However, the court justified its reliance on the fact that \r\n  the appellant was strictly bound by the terms of the stock purchase agreement \r\n  at the time the marital litigation commenced. Id.Â  Importantly, we also \r\n  note that the McElveen court explicitly opined that â€œ[o]ur holding as \r\n  to the determinative nature of the stock purchase agreement in this case should \r\n  be viewed as limited to the facts presently before us.â€ Id.\r\nIn the present case, Husbandâ€™s ability \r\n  to market his interest in the company was not restricted by the stock purchase \r\n  agreement.Â  The shareholders who sold their stock under the 1993 agreement retained \r\n  the right to retake their shares in the event Husband voluntarily or involuntarily \r\n  sold, pledged, transferred, or alienated his shares in the company.Â  This provision \r\n  of the agreement did not, however, completely foreclose Husbandâ€™s ability to \r\n  market and sell his interest in the company to a third party in an arms-length \r\n  transaction.Â  He could do so, provided the debt owed to the exiting shareholders \r\n  was fully paid.Â  \r\nThe family court specifically \r\n  questioned Wifeâ€™s expert on this point at the final hearing, asking the witness: \r\n\r\n\r\nSo that if [Husband] were to \r\n  sell [his interest in the company], it automatically triggers the alienation; \r\n  in other words, for him to sell the corporation, he has to first pay off the \r\n  debt of the $145,000?Â  . . .Â  [M]eaning that a purchaser would have to pay an \r\n  unsecured $145,000.00 in anticipation of being able to then buy the corporation. \r\n\r\n\r\nWifeâ€™s expert agreed with the judgeâ€™s assessment \r\n  of the effect of the alienation restriction.Â  The judge then queried: â€œUnder \r\n  those unique circumstances, would that discount the value of the corporation?â€Â  \r\n  Wifeâ€™s expert replied that he had taken into account the effect of the restriction \r\n  in arriving at his valuation, responding:\r\n\r\nI do believe that does.Â  That \r\n  it does impact our thirty percent marketability under capitalized cash flow.Â  \r\n  Um â€“ as far as whether it would affect the market method from the company stock \r\n  â€“ method, which is what Iâ€™m using, we still subtracted that $145,000.00 owed \r\n  from that method as well.\r\nUm â€“ I donâ€™t â€“ I donâ€™t think \r\n  that would affect the marketability using the market methods, but I think that \r\n  it definitely impacts our marketability discount for capitalized cash flow.\r\nI believe the thirty percent \r\n  [marketability discount] takes that into account though. \r\n\r\n\r\n  This colloquy between the court and Wifeâ€™s expert, in conjunction with the supporting \r\n  valuation report contained in the record, demonstrates that the family court \r\n  gave due consideration to the agreementâ€™s restrictions on Husbandâ€™s ability \r\n  to sell his interest in the company.Â  \r\nWe find the family courtâ€™s valuation is supported by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence, and therefore, find no error.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Exclusion of Credit Card Debt\r\nHusband next argues the family \r\n  court erred by failing to include the $3,526 Visa credit card debt in the marital \r\n  estate.Â  We agree.\r\nFor purposes of equitable distribution, \r\n  marital property is defined in South Carolina Code section 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003) \r\n  as â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during \r\n  the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of \r\n  marital litigation . . . .â€Â Â  Under this statutory provision, there is a â€œ[rebuttable] \r\n  presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation \r\n  is a marital debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â  \r\n  Wooten v. Wooten, 358 S.C. 54, ___, 594 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2003) (quoting \r\n  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (alteration in original)). \r\nWife claims the credit card debt \r\n  was properly excluded because there is no evidence in the record which reflects \r\n  the amount of the debt as of March 16, 1999, the date the marital litigation \r\n  was commenced.Â  Specifically, she argues the August 6, 1999 credit card statement \r\n  Husband introduced into evidenceâ€”the only independent, third-party verification \r\n  of the amount of debtâ€”should not be considered by the court because it was prepared \r\n  almost five months after the marital litigation commenced.Â  \r\nHowever, this statement is not the only evidence \r\n  before us.Â Â Â  In his March 6, 2002 financial declaration filed with the family \r\n  court, Husband included an entry for the â€œNations Bank Visaâ€ listing the precise \r\n  balance as $3,526.Â  Further, Wife admitted in her testimony that she used the \r\n  credit card for business and personal purchases during the marriage.Â  The credit \r\n  card statement also lists both Husband and Wife as cardholders.Â  Finally, as \r\n  noted above, Husband submitted several credit card receipts for charges incurred \r\n  prior to the litigation which bear Wifeâ€™s signature. \r\nBased on our review of the totality of the facts \r\n  before us, we find a preponderance of the evidence warrants inclusion of the \r\n  credit card debt as marital property in the amount reflected on Husbandâ€™s financial \r\n  declaration.Â  We therefore modify the family courtâ€™s final order to include \r\n  the credit card debt in the marital estate for distribution between the parties \r\n  according to the terms of that order.Â  Those proportions are fifty-five percent \r\n  to Husband and forty-five percent to Wife. \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s FeesÂ Â Â  \r\nHusband next argues the family court \r\n  erred by awarding Wife $30,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, claiming the award \r\n  was excessive in light of the results of the case.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Bowers v. Bowers, \r\n  349 S.C. 85, 99, 561 S.E.2d 610, 617 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When determining the \r\n  amount of fees to award, the court must consider the nature, extent, and difficulty \r\n  of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s \r\n  professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results \r\n  obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. Glasscock v. \r\n  Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nIn this case, the family court \r\n  detailed the rationale for its award in its final order, addressing the applicable \r\n  Glasscock factors.Â  Though we modify the family courtâ€™s final order in \r\n  favor of Husband by including the credit card debt as marital property, we find \r\n  this change does not significantly alter the beneficial result obtained by Wife \r\n  in the case as a whole.Â  The litigation in this case continued for over two \r\n  years and included disputed issues of child support and alimony in addition \r\n  to the extensive questions involving the valuation and apportionment of marital \r\n  property.Â  Accordingly, we conclude the family court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in its award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above reasons, we affirm the \r\n  family courtâ€™s valuation of the marital interest of J.L. Wynn &amp; Sons, Inc., \r\n  modify the courtâ€™s final order to include the outstanding credit card debt as \r\n  marital property for purposes of equitable distribution, and affirm the award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3809","title":"State v.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3809\r\nHeard May 12, 2004 â€“ Filed June 1, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh and Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Appellant.\r\nChristopher A. Wellborn, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  We are asked to determine \r\n  whether the circuit court, in its appellate capacity, has jurisdiction to hear \r\n  an appeal from a magistrate courtâ€™s pre-trial ruling that precludes or significantly \r\n  impairs the prosecution of a criminal case.Â  We hold the circuit court has jurisdiction \r\n  over such an appeal.Â  The contrary decision of the circuit court is reversed, \r\n  and the matter is remanded.\r\nFACTS\r\nElaine P. Belviso was arrested \r\n  and charged with driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration and violating \r\n  the open container law.Â  The magistrate, relying on State v. Jackson, \r\n  302 S.C. 313, 396 S.E.2d 101 (1990), dismissed the open container charge because \r\n  the State did not preserve the container or the alcoholic beverage.Â  The magistrate \r\n  also suppressed critical evidence relating to the charge of driving with an \r\n  unlawful alcohol concentration. [1] \r\nThe State appealed the magistrateâ€™s rulings \r\n  and moved for a stay of further magistrate court proceedings pending resolution \r\n  of the appeal.Â  The magistrateâ€™s rulings effectively precluded prosecution of \r\n  the Stateâ€™s case.Â  The circuit court granted the motion for a stay.Â  \r\nThe circuit court, relying exclusively \r\n  on section 18-3-10 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, held it did not have \r\n  jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal from a magistrateâ€™s court.Â  The \r\n  circuit court dismissed the appeal.Â  The State appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWe agree with the State that the circuit court \r\n  has jurisdiction to entertain the Stateâ€™s appeal from the magistrateâ€™s pre-trial \r\n  rulings that would preclude prosecution of the open container charge \r\n  [2]  and significantly impair the Stateâ€™s ability to proceed with the prosecution \r\n  of the unlawful driving charge. [3]   \r\nThe circuit court relied exclusively on section \r\n  18-3-10 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2003) in ruling the circuit \r\n  court did not have jurisdiction to hear the Stateâ€™s appeal.Â  Section 18-3-10 \r\n  provides: â€œEvery person convicted before a magistrate of any offense whatever \r\n  and sentenced may appeal from the sentence to the Court of Common Pleas for \r\n  the county.â€Â  The circuit court reasoned that because section 18-3-10 only permits \r\n  appeals by those convicted and sentenced in magistrateâ€™s court, the circuit \r\n  court has no authority to hear an appeal from magistrateâ€™s court prior to conviction \r\n  and sentence.\r\nÂ The circuit courtâ€™s narrow reliance on this statutory \r\n  provision is misplaced, for in South Carolina, the Stateâ€™s right to appeal is \r\n  defined by our judicial decisions, not statutory law.Â  State v. McKnight, \r\n  353 S.C. 238, 238, 577 S.E.2d 456, 457 (2003).Â  Because the Stateâ€™s right to \r\n  appeal in criminal cases is a judicially created right, we turn to our judicial \r\n  decisions, which uniformly support the circuit courtâ€™s jurisdiction to hear \r\n  the Stateâ€™s appeal in this matter.Â  We begin with the settled principle that \r\n  â€œ[a] pre-trial order granting the suppression of evidence which significantly \r\n  impairs the prosecution of a criminal case is directly appealable under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1976).â€Â  State v. McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, \r\n  168, 337 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1985).Â  Under McKnight, the State has the right \r\n  to immediately appeal a trial courtâ€™s suppression of evidence which significantly \r\n  impairs the prosecution of the case.Â  There is additional precedent refuting \r\n  Belvisoâ€™s position, adopted by the circuit court, that no appeal may be taken \r\n  from a magistrateâ€™s court until a defendant is convicted and sentenced.Â  In \r\n  State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 408 S.E.2d 235 (1991), the magistrate \r\n  suppressed evidence relating to a driving under the influence (DUI) charge.Â  \r\n  The State appealed to the circuit court and the circuit court affirmed.Â  Id. \r\n  at 321, 408 S.E.2d at 236.Â  Although the appeal was interlocutory, the circuit \r\n  court and the supreme court heard the appeal.Â  State v. Whetstone, 333 \r\n  S.C. 376, 510 S.E.2d 225 (Ct. App. 1998) also supports the circuit courtâ€™s exercise \r\n  of jurisdiction over the Stateâ€™s appeal from the magistrateâ€™s pre-trial rulings.Â  \r\n  The circuit court in Whetstone, as well as this court, heard the Stateâ€™s \r\n  appeal from the magistrate courtâ€™s dismissal of a charge.Â  Id. at 377, \r\n  510 S.E.2d at 225-26.Â  Similarly, in State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, \r\n  456, 539 S.E.2d 717, 718 (Ct. App. 2000), the circuit court and this court exercised \r\n  jurisdiction over the Stateâ€™s appeal from the magistrate courtâ€™s dismissal of \r\n  a DUI charge.Â  This authority provides ample support for the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  ability to hear the Stateâ€™s appeal from the magistrate courtâ€™s pre-trial rulings \r\n  dismissing the open container charge and suppressing critical evidence in connection \r\n  with the charge of driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration.Â Â Â  \r\nWe further conclude this result is consistent \r\n  with the intent of the Legislature, especially when our statutory law is considered \r\n  in its entirety. Section 18-3-10 cannot properly be read in isolation.Â  Chapter \r\n  1 of Title 18 of the South Carolina Code of Laws provides general guidelines \r\n  for appeals in civil and criminal actions.Â  For example, section 18-1-30 provides \r\n  that â€œ[a]ny party aggrieved may appeal in the cases prescribed in this Title.â€Â  \r\n  Section 18-1-130 authorizes appeals from â€œany intermediate order involving the \r\n  merits and necessarily affecting the judgment.â€Â  Chapters 3 and 5 of Title 14 \r\n  of our code of laws contain further confirmation of the circuit courtâ€™s power \r\n  to hear the Stateâ€™s appeal.Â  Section 14-3-330, as held in McKnight, 287 \r\n  S.C. at 168, 337 S.E.2d at 209, permits an interlocutory appeal when the order \r\n  â€œin effect determines the action . . . or discontinues the action.â€Â  Section \r\n  14-5-340 expressly authorizes the circuit court to â€œhear appeals from magistratesâ€™ \r\n  courts and municipal courts . . . . â€ The foregoing sampling of statutes repudiates \r\n  the nonsensical view of legislative intent urged by Belviso.Â  Belvisoâ€™s myopic \r\n  view of section 18-3-10 would require us to ignore other pertinent statutes \r\n  and lead to a rule foreclosing any possibility of review of intermediate \r\n  orders from magistratesâ€™ courts and municipal courts.Â  That would be â€œa result \r\n  so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature \r\n  . . . .â€Â  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. \r\n  271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  In construing the statutory scheme as \r\n  a whole, we â€œescape the absurdityâ€ and give efficacy to the manifest intention \r\n  of the General Assembly.Â  Id.Â Â  In doing so, our judicial decisions addressing \r\n  the â€œright of appealâ€ are in accord with legislative intent.\r\nCONCLUSION&nbsp;\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court, in\r\nits appellate capacity, has jurisdiction to entertain the Stateâ€™s appeal from\r\nthe magistrateâ€™s pre-trial rulings dismissing the open container charge and\r\nsuppressing evidence which significantly impairs the prosecution of the unlawful\r\ndriving charge.&nbsp; The decision of the\r\ncircuit court is REVERSED and the matter\r\nis REMANDED\r\nfor further proceedings. \r\n\r\n\r\n ANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Belviso makes no challenge to critical nature of the evidence \r\n    encompassed in the magistrateâ€™s pre-trial rulings.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The open container charge was dismissed pre-trial on the legal \r\n    ground of a purported violation of the holding in State v. Jackson, \r\n    302 S.C. 313, 396 S.E.2d 101 (1990).Â  Therefore, the dismissal of the charge \r\n    is appealable.Â  See State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 539 S.E.2d \r\n    717 (Ct.

Undersigned hereby declares that the terms of this settlement have \r\n  been completely read and are fully understood and voluntarily accepted for the \r\n  purpose of making a full and final compromise adjustment and settlement of any \r\n  and all claims, disputed or otherwise, on account of the injuries and damages \r\n  above mentioned, and for the express purpose of precluding forever any further \r\n  or additional claims arising out of the aforesaid accident. \r\n\r\nShortly after signing the releases, the Joneses \r\n  and Byson asserted separate claims against the SCDOT, alleging its negligence \r\n  contributed to the accident.Â  Specifically, they claimed SCDOT breached its \r\n  duty to properly keep the roadway clear of bushes and brush thereby obstructing \r\n  Tiffany Jonesâ€™ view of the roadway and preventing her from safely entering traffic \r\n  on Highway 21.Â  On SCDOTâ€™s motion for summary judgment, the circuit court dismissed \r\n  both claims, finding the suits were barred by the â€œclear and unequivocalâ€ terms \r\n  of the releases. [1] Â  The Joneses \r\n  and Byson appeal. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP;Â  see also Tupper v. \r\n  Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997);Â  Wells \r\n  v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n  However, the circuit court may properly consider only â€œsuch facts as would be \r\n  admissible in evidence.â€Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP;Â  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. \r\n  169, 175, 561 S.E.2d 654, 657 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating â€œmaterials used to support \r\n  or refute a motion for summary judgment must be those which would be admissible \r\n  in evidenceâ€).Â  In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, this court applies \r\n  the same standard that governs the circuit court: summary judgment is proper \r\n  when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP;Â  Baughman \r\n  v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 \r\n  (1991).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred \r\n  by finding their claims against SCDOT were barred by the releases they signed \r\n  (collectively, the â€œReleaseâ€).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Release is a contract.Â  See \r\n  Hyman v. Ford Motor Co., 142 F.Supp.2d 735 (D.S.C. 2001) (applying South \r\n  Carolina law, contract principles invoked to determine validity of a release); \r\n  Lowery v. Callahan, 210 S.C. 300, 300, 42 S.E.2d 457, 458 (1947) (noting \r\n  that the â€œsame principles of adequacy of consideration which apply to other \r\n  contracts, govern as to releasesâ€); 18 S.C. Jur. Release Â§ 2 (2003) (â€œBecause \r\n  a release is a contract, principles of law applicable to contracts generally \r\n  are also applicable to releases.â€).Â  â€œIn construing terms in contracts, this \r\n  Court must first look at the language of the contract to determine the intentions \r\n  of the parties.â€Â  C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp; \r\n  Human Services Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988).Â  \r\n  Since the Release unambiguously sets forth the contracting partiesâ€™ intent, \r\n  we are bound by that clearly expressed intent without resort to extrinsic evidence.Â  \r\n  â€œExtrinsic evidence giving the contract a different meaning from that indicated \r\n  by its plain terms is inadmissible.â€Â  Id. at 377-78, 373 S.E.2d at 586.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the circuit court applied the proper summary judgment standard \r\n  and correctly determined Appellantsâ€™ unmistakable intent from the terms of the \r\n  Release without resort to affidavits and deposition excerpts.Â  Hall, \r\n  349 s.c. at 175, 561 S.E.2d at 657.\r\nIn Bartholomew v. McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, \r\n  179 S.E.2d 912 (1971), our supreme court stated that â€œthe release of one tort-feasor \r\n  does not release others who wrongfully contributed to plaintiffâ€™s injuries unless \r\n  this was the intention of the parties, or unless plaintiff has, in fact, received \r\n  full compensation amounting to a satisfaction.â€Â  Id. at 491, 179 S.E.2d \r\n  at 913.Â  The circuit court based its determination on both prongs of Bartholomew, \r\n  concluding that, under the terms of the Release, the parties received full compensation \r\n  and intended that all claims for injuries would be relinquished.Â  We agree.\r\nThe terms of the Release do not evince an intent \r\n  to limit its scope to any specifically identified parties.Â  Rather, the Release \r\n  is general and all encompassing in its scope.Â  It clearly states that the Appellants \r\n  released the tort-feasor â€œand all other persons, firms or corporations liable, \r\n  or who might be claimed to be liable.â€Â  This language is a clear, explicit, \r\n  and unequivocal indication of the partiesâ€™ intent that all claims arising \r\n  from the accident â€“ now and in the future â€“are barred under the terms of the Release.Â  Had \r\n  Appellants intended a contrary result and desired to limit the operation of \r\n  the Release to named persons only, the terms of the Release could have been \r\n  easily tailored to that end.Â  We are constrained by the plain, unambiguous language \r\n  of the Release to find that Appellantsâ€™ claims against SCDOT fall within the \r\n  terms of the Release.\r\nThis result is also compelled under the second \r\n  prong of Bartholomew.Â  The Release clearly and unequivocally contemplates \r\n  that the respective settlement payments to Appellants constituted a â€œfull compensation \r\n  amounting to a satisfaction.â€Â  \r\nAppellants, however, argue that â€œdamages to be \r\n  awarded for injury and resulting pain and suffering cannot be determined with \r\n  mathematical precisionâ€ and this determination is, therefore, always â€œan issue \r\n  of fact.â€Â  They essentially argue that full compensation is always a function \r\n  of the juryâ€™s discretion, rendering summary judgment unavailable.Â  While we \r\n  agree that damages, especially non-pecuniary damages, in a personal injury claim \r\n  are difficult to ascertain in light of the broad discretion accorded the trier \r\n  of fact, Appellants misconstrue the precise issue before us.Â  The issue is not \r\n  determining the exact amount (assuming liability) a jury would award.Â  Instead, \r\n  the issue is â€œfull compensation amounting to a satisfaction.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 491, 179 S.E.2d at 913. (emphasis added)\r\nA â€œsatisfactionâ€ is generally defined as â€œ[t]he \r\n  discharge of an obligation by paying a party what is due to himâ€ or â€œ[t]he performance \r\n  of a substituted obligation in return for the discharge of the original obligation.â€Â  \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1342 (6th ed. 1990).Â  In cases involving a disputed \r\n  or liquidated claim arising in contract or tort, the parties will reach an â€œaccordâ€ \r\n  whereby one of the parties agrees to accept as â€œsatisfactionâ€ of the disputed \r\n  claim some performance or undertaking different from that which he considers \r\n  himself entitled.Â  See South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. \r\n  Kelly, 345 S.C. 232, 239, 547 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting that \r\n  â€œ[a]n accord and satisfaction occurs when there is (1) an agreement to accept \r\n  in discharge of an obligation something different from that which the creditor \r\n  is claiming or is entitled to receive; and (2) payment of the consideration \r\n  expressed in the new agreement.â€) (quoting Tremont Constr. Co. v. Dunlap, \r\n  310 S.C. 180, 182, 425 S.E.2d 792, 793 (Ct. App. 1992); Mercury Marine Div. \r\n  v. Costas, 288 S.C. 383, 386, 342 S.E.2d 632, 633 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  Indeed, \r\n  parties regularly reach compromise settlements for a variety of reasons, including \r\n  the vagaries and unpredictability of litigation and the desire for finality. \r\n  Â Where, as here, a party accepts â€œa full and final compromise adjustment and \r\n  settlement of any and all claims,â€ such amounts to a Bartholomew satisfaction, \r\n  thereby extending the preclusive effect of the release to nonparties to the \r\n  instrument.\r\nWe reject the suggestion that Bartholomew v. \r\n  McCartha has been overruled by the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors \r\n  Act (UCATA).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-38-10 to 70 (Supp. 2003).Â  In our judgment, \r\n  UCATA mirrors the rule in Bartholomew.Â  Section 15-38-50 provides in \r\n  part that a release â€œdoes not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability \r\n  . . . unless its terms so provide . . . .â€ (emphasis added).Â  In any \r\n  event, UCATA â€œshall not apply to governmental entities . . . [and the] South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act is the exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed \r\n  by an employee of a governmental entity . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-65 \r\n  (Supp. 1999).Â  UCATA, thus, does not apply to SCDOT.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe terms of the Release here are clear and unambiguous: \r\n  Appellants released â€œall other persons, firms or corporations liable or, who \r\n  might be claimed to be liableâ€ and the settlement was accepted as a â€œfull and \r\n  final compromise . . . precluding forever any further or additional claims arising \r\n  out of the aforesaid accident.â€Â  The Release, by its unmistakable terms, establishes \r\n  Appellantsâ€™ intent as a matter of law, and forecloses the need for any further \r\n  inquiry regarding both its scope and the presence of â€œfull compensation amounting \r\n  to a satisfaction.â€Â  The explicit, plain language of the Release permits no \r\n  other finding.Â  We therefore find the Release bars Appellantsâ€™ actions against \r\n  SCDOT.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondent \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] SCDOT moved for summary judgment on multiple grounds.Â  \r\n    The circuit court granted summary judgment only as to the releases.Â  The balance \r\n    of the motion was denied due to disputed â€œfactual issues.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3811","title":"Estate of Sherman v.

Mullinax, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This appeal arises \r\n  from a declaratory judgment regarding a deed executed by Rosemary C. Sherman \r\n  to herself and her husband, Norman E. Sherman.Â  The trial court found the deed \r\n  effectively created a right of survivorship, and therefore, the subject property \r\n  belonged in fee simple to Normanâ€™s estate.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nRosemary was the owner in fee simple \r\n  absolute of her residence.Â  On June 27, 1985, she conveyed her property to Norman \r\n  and herself without using an intervening conveyance.Â  The granting clause in \r\n  the deed reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Rosemary C. Sherman . . . do[es] \r\n    grant, bargain, sell and release unto said Norman E. Sherman and Rosemary \r\n    C. Sherman for and during their joint lives and upon the death of either of \r\n    them, then to the survivor of them, his or her heirs and assigns, forever, \r\n    in fee simple, together with every contingent remainder and right of reversion.\r\n\r\nThe habendum clause contains similar \r\n  language.Â  \r\nRosemary died in February of 2002, \r\n  predeceasing Norman who died ten days later.Â  Believing the 1985 deed failed \r\n  to create a joint tenancy because an intervening or â€œstraw manâ€ conveyance was \r\n  not used, Rosemaryâ€™s estate (â€œAppellantâ€) brought this action against Normanâ€™s \r\n  estate (â€œRespondentâ€) to determine the deedâ€™s validity and the nature and extent \r\n  of the interest it conveyed.Â  Respondent argued that although straw man conveyances \r\n  were typically used in the past, section 62-2-804 of the South Carolina Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003) applies retroactively to Rosemaryâ€™s deed and allows an owner to \r\n  convey property to himself and another in joint tenancy.Â  \r\n The trial judge agreed with Respondent \r\n  and found that Respondent owned the land in fee simple.Â  This appeal follows. \r\n  \r\n &nbsp; STANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\nThe issue of title is legal in nature.Â  \r\n  Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, \r\n  428, 489 S.E.2d 223, 224 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In an action at law, tried without \r\n  a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s standard of review extends only to the correction \r\n  of errors of law.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. \r\n  140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\n  ISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     \r\n      I.\r\n      Whether \r\n        South Carolina follows the common law with respect to the conveyance of \r\n        real property in observing the unities of time, title, interest, and possession?\r\n    \r\n     \r\n      II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Whether \r\n        the trial court erred in finding that, in 1985, no intervening conveyance \r\n        was necessary to observe the four unities of time, title, interest, and \r\n        possession?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.&nbsp;\r\n      Whether \r\n        the trial court erred in retroactively applying section 62-2-804 of the \r\n        South Carolina Code to a 1985 deed?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that because Rosemary \r\n  did not use an intervening conveyance or straw man to convey the property to \r\n  herself and Norman, the four unities of title were lacking, and therefore, no \r\n  valid joint tenancy was created.Â  Appellant asserts that, at most, Rosemaryâ€™s \r\n  1985 deed created a tenancy in common.Â  â€œThe common law method of creating a \r\n  joint tenancy requires a conveyance to have four unities:Â  unity of interest, \r\n  unity of title, unity of time, and unity of possession.â€Â  Smith v. Rucker, \r\n  __Â  S.C. __, 593 S.E.2d 497, 499 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Jenkins v. Jenkins, \r\n  8 S.C.L. (1 Mill) 48, 52 (1817)).Â  While this court recognizes the common practice \r\n  of using an intervening conveyance in this type of transfer in order to effectively \r\n  observe the four unities, we need not reach issues I or II because we find that \r\n  section 62-2-804 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) applies retroactively.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n  \r\n    Section 62-2-804 provides as \r\n      follows: \r\n    When any person is seized or \r\n      possessed of any estate of joint tenancy at the time of his death, the joint \r\n      tenancy is deemed to have been severed by the death of the joint tenant \r\n      and the estate is distributable as a tenancy in common unless the instrument \r\n      which creates the joint tenancy, including any instrument in which one \r\n      person conveys to himself and one or more other persons, or two or more \r\n      persons convey to themselves, or to themselves and another or others, expressly \r\n      provides for a right of survivorship, in which case the severance does not \r\n      occur.Â  While other methods for the creation of a joint tenancy may \r\n      be utilized, an express provision for a right of survivorship is conclusively \r\n      deemed to have occurred if the will or instrument of conveyance contains \r\n      the names of the devisees or grantees followed by the words â€œas joint tenants \r\n      with right of survivorship and not as tenants in commonâ€.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-804 (Supp. \r\n  2003) (emphasis added).Â  In 1996, the statute was amended to include the language \r\n  that allows one person to create a joint tenancy by conveying property to himself \r\n  and one or more other persons, without the use of a straw man.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  That same year, the South Carolina General Assembly also provided that â€œ[t]his \r\n  act . . . applies to joint tenancies created either prior to or after the effective \r\n  date of the act.â€Â  Id.Â  By its plain language, section 62-2-804 retroactively \r\n  applies to deeds created prior to its enactment and allows for the creation \r\n  of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship without the use of an intervening \r\n  conveyance.Â   \r\nAppellant argues section 62-2-804 \r\n  conflicts with section 27-7-40; thus, the trial court erred in applying section \r\n  62-2-804 to Rosemaryâ€™s deed.Â  We disagree.Â  Section 27-7-40 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) states:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    In addition to any other methods \r\n      for the creation of a joint tenancy in real estate which may exist by law, \r\n      whenever any deed of conveyance of real estate contains the names of the \r\n      grantees followed by the words â€œas joint tenants with rights of survivorship, \r\n      and not as tenants in commonâ€ the creation of a joint tenancy with rights \r\n      of survivorship in the real estate is conclusively deemed to have been created.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe statute lists the incidents of \r\n  ownership which amount to joint tenancies and further provides that â€œ[t]he provisions \r\n  of this section must be liberally construed to carry out the intentions of the \r\n  parties.Â  This section supersedes any conflicting provisions of Section 62-2-804.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-40 (Supp. 2003).\r\nAppellant contends section 62-2-804â€™s \r\n  recognition that one person may create a joint tenancy by a conveyance to himself \r\n  and another conflicts with section 27-7-40, and therefore, section 27-7-40 controls.Â  \r\n  Appellant further asserts that section 62-2-804â€™s retroactive application is \r\n  in conflict with section 27-7-40â€™s prospective application.Â  In essence, Appellant \r\n  claims that when Rosemary executed the deed in 1985, in order to create a valid \r\n  joint tenancy, she either had to use the specific language provided in section \r\n  27-7-40 or use an intervening conveyance.Â  We disagree, and agree with the trial \r\n  judge who held that the two statutes are not in conflict.Â  There is simply no \r\n  provision in section 27-7-40 which conflicts with section 62-2-804â€™s instruction \r\n  that one person can create a joint tenancy by a conveyance to himself and another \r\n  without the use of a straw man.Â  Further, we find no provision in section 27-7-40 \r\n  that conflicts with the retroactivity provision of section 62-2-804.Â  \r\nBased on the above, we find the trial \r\n  judge properly applied section 62-2-804 retroactively to Rosemaryâ€™s 1985 deed.Â  \r\n  Under section 62-2-804, a deed which purports to create a joint tenancy with \r\n  rights of survivorship will not be severed at the death of one of the joint \r\n  tenants even if the grantor failed to utilize an intervening conveyance so long \r\n  as the deed expressly provides for a right of survivorship.Â  The language in \r\n  Rosemaryâ€™s deed stating that the property would pass, â€œupon the death of either \r\n  of them then to the survivor of them,â€ expressly provides for the right of survivorship.Â  \r\n  Therefore, applying section 62-2-804 retroactively, we find Rosemary effectively \r\n  created non-severable rights of survivorship in her 1985 deed.Â  As such, we \r\n  find the trial judge did not err in giving section 62-2-804 retroactive application \r\n  and declaring that the subject property belonged to Respondent in fee simple.Â  \r\n  \r\nMoreover, the result is the same \r\n  whether the 1985 deed created a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common because \r\n  Rosemaryâ€™s intention to create a survivorship benefit will be enforced where \r\n  it is clearly manifested by the deed.Â  In Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. 182, \r\n  75 S.E.2d 46 (1953), a deed to husband and wife purported to create a tenancy \r\n  by the entirety.Â  A tenancy by the entirety â€œis essentially a joint tenancy, \r\n  modified by the common law theory that husband and wife are one person.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 185, 75 S.E.2d at 47.Â  The supreme court found that the tenancy by the entirety \r\n  could not exist.Â  However, because the deed granted the property to husband \r\n  and wife, as tenants by the entirety, and the survivor of them, the supreme \r\n  court effectuated the right of survivorship.Â  The court stated, â€œ[we] think \r\n  that by adding the phrase â€˜and the survivor of themâ€™, the parties in this case \r\n  clearly indicated the nature of the estate intended to be created, namely, that \r\n  upon the death of either of the grantees the absolute estate should vest in \r\n  the survivor.â€Â  Id. at 191-92, 75 S.E.2d at 50. \r\nSimilarly, Rosemaryâ€™s deed plainly \r\n  stated that upon the death of one of them, the property would pass â€œto the survivor \r\n  of them.â€Â  Just as the survivorship language in the deed in Davis created \r\n  a survivorship right, we find this language in Rosemaryâ€™s deed created a survivorship \r\n  right, regardless of whether the deed created a joint tenancy or a tenancy in \r\n  common.Â  â€œIt is elementary that the cardinal rule of construction is to ascertain \r\n  and effectuate the intention of the parties, unless that intention contravenes \r\n  some well settled rule of law or public policy.â€Â  Id. at 184, 75 S.E.2d \r\n  at 47.Â  The language in the 1985 deed states Rosemaryâ€™s intention to create \r\n  a right of survivorship.Â  See Rucker, __ S.C. __, 593 S.E.2d 497, \r\n  498 (finding a deed granting property to husband and wife â€œfor and during their \r\n  joint lives and upon the death of either of them, then to the survivorâ€ unquestionably \r\n  created survivorship rights).Â  Therefore, even if a tenancy in common was created, \r\n  the language in the deed establishing Rosemaryâ€™s intention to create a right \r\n  of survivorship allows the benefit of survivorship to be attached to this estate.Â  \r\n  As a result, upon Rosemaryâ€™s death, Norman became the owner of the property \r\n  in fee simple absolute.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge properly ruled in favor \r\n  of Respondent.\r\nCONCLUSIONÂ  \r\nWe find the 1985 deed \r\n  created non-severable rights of survivorship and, as such, the trial judge did \r\n  not err in giving section 62-2-804 retroactive application and declaring that \r\n  the subject property belonged to Respondent in fee simple.Â  In addition, regardless \r\n  of whether the deed created a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, a survivorship \r\n  benefit still attached to the estate because of the applicable language of intent \r\n  in the deed.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3812","title":"State v.

Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 145, 502 S.E.2d 99, 106 (1998).Â  A denial of a new \r\n  trial based on alleged jury misconduct is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  State v. Covington,&nbsp;343 S.C. 157, 163, 539 S.E.2d 67, 69-70&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2000).Â  Likewise, where the motion is based upon allegations that a juror \r\n  gave misleading or incomplete answers during voir dire, the trial court's denial \r\n  of that motion will be affirmed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Comments Overheard by Juror \r\n  Jones\r\nGalbreath first alleges that Juror \r\n  Jones was improperly influenced by extra-judicial comments he heard during lunch.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Galbreath points to another jurorâ€™s affidavit, which alleged: \r\n  \r\n\r\n  After the deliberations but before \r\n    we left the jury room, a juror named Mark Jones stated that he went to a Mexican \r\n    restaurant during the trial and the Defendant and his family and friends were \r\n    there eating also.Â  He stated that he heard people at the Defendantâ€™s table \r\n    making threats and heard one of the men say that he would â€œcut that bitchâ€™s \r\n    throat.â€ \r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial judge that \r\n  this allegation, even if true, does not entitle Galbreath to a new trial.Â  \r\nWhen an allegation is made \r\nthat extraneous information may have improperly influenced jurors, the â€œ[r]elevant \r\nfactors to be considered . . . are the number of jurors exposed, the weight of \r\nthe evidence properly before the jury, and the likelihood that curative measures \r\nwere effective in reducing the prejudice.â€Â  Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141-42, \r\n509 S.E.2d at 104 (1998).Â  Further, where a defendant seeks a new trial on the \r\nbasis of juror misconduct, he is required to prove both the alleged misconduct \r\nand the resulting prejudice.Â  Covington, 343 S.C. at 163, 539 S.E.2d at \r\n70.  In this case, Juror Jones was the only juror who might have \r\nconsidered the extraneous information during deliberations because the affidavit \r\nstates that Jones did not mention the information to the others until after deliberations.Â  \r\nAs for the weight of evidence before the jury, the State presented four witnesses \r\nwho testified that Galbreath hit Rogers in the head with a shotgun.Â  Furthermore, \r\nalthough the trial judge was not able to specifically address the overheard conversation, \r\nhe did instruct the jury that:Â  â€œUnder the oath you took, you swore to try the \r\ncase based only and solely on the testimony, evidence and law presented and heard \r\nin this courtroom.Â  It is your duty to lay aside all bias or prejudice or sympathy \r\nyou may have in reaching your verdict.â€Â  Considering these factors, we find the \r\ntrial judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling that the comments Juror Jones \r\noverheard had very little prejudicial effect or influence on the juryâ€™s verdict. \r\nAdditionally, the statement Jones overheard was not made by Galbreath \r\nbut by an individual who was dining with Galbreath, thereby lessening any possible \r\nprejudicial effect.Â  Generally, the determination of whether extraneous information \r\nreceived by a juror during the course of the trial is prejudicial is a matter \r\nfor determination by the trial judge, and we see no reason to upset the judgeâ€™s \r\nfinding that there was no prejudice.Â  Kelly, 331 S.C. at 142, 509 S.E.2d \r\nat 104.Â Â   \r\nII.Â Juror Stoneâ€™s Relationship with the Stinnett Family \r\nGalbreath also argues that another juror, Juror Stone, intentionally \r\nwithheld information during voir dire, and in support of this argument, Galbreath \r\nsubmitted various affidavits about a relationship between Juror Stone and the \r\nStinnett family.Â  Anna Stinnett was a victim and witness in this case, and Galbreath \r\nalleges that Stone knew Stinnettâ€™s mother.Â  Galbreath also alleges that Stoneâ€™s \r\nbrother-in-law and nephew rent a pasture and house respectively from an undisclosed \r\nmember of the Stinnett family.Â  Even assuming these allegations are true, we find \r\nJuror Stone did not intentionally withhold any information about her relationship \r\nwith the Stinnett family from the trial court. A new trial is only \r\nrequired when a juror intentionally conceals information during voir dire.Â  State \r\nv. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 588, 550 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001).Â  Galbreath frames \r\nStoneâ€™s lack of disclosure as intentional and argues that the disclosure would \r\nhave induced him to use a peremptory strike against her.Â  However, during voir \r\ndire, the trial judge only asked if â€œ[a]ny member of the jury panel [is a] close \r\npersonal friend, [or] business associate of any of the potential witnesses?â€Â  \r\nBecause none of the information in the affidavits indicates Juror Stone had a \r\nclose personal friendship or business relationship with any of the witnesses, \r\nthere is no evidence that she intentionally concealed any information from the \r\ntrial judge. [1]   Galbreath \r\nalso argues Stone was not forthright with the court because she did not respond \r\nwhen the trial judge asked whether any member of the jury panel knew of any reason \r\nwhy he or she could not give both the State of South Carolina and the defendant \r\na fair and impartial trial.Â  There is no suggestion in the affidavits that Juror \r\nStone viewed herself as an incapable or uncomfortable juror.Â  In fact, Stoneâ€™s \r\ndecision not to respond to this question suggests that she felt she could be an \r\nimpartial and fair juror. [2] Â  Furthermore, even if this court found some \r\ntype of juror misconduct, Galbreath has made no showing of prejudice, especially \r\nconsidering he was acquitted for pointing and presenting a firearm at Anna Stinnett.Â  \r\nSee Covington, 343 S.C. at 163, 539 S.E.2d at 70 (requiring \r\na showing of prejudice when a defendant seeks a new trial on the basis of juror \r\nmisconduct).   \r\n III.&nbsp;Incorrect Sentencing \r\n  Information from Juror Owens\r\nDefense counsel also provided affidavits \r\n  from Juror Owens and Juror Ellenburg, which state that during the course of \r\n  deliberations, the subject of punishment arose after the jury had decided that \r\n  Galbreath was not guilty of assault and battery with intent to kill but before \r\n  it had made a decision on the lesser included charges of ABHAN and simple assault \r\n  and battery.Â  At that point, Juror Owens explained that, based on personal experience, \r\n  Galbreath would receive a fine but no jail time if he was convicted of ABHAN.Â  \r\n  Jurors Owen and Ellenburg both allege that if they had known Galbreath was facing \r\n  prison time, they would have gone through the elements of the charges again \r\n  and would have found him guilty only of simple assault and battery.Â  Galbreath \r\n  argues this sentencing information, like the comments Juror Jones overheard \r\n  while he was at lunch, constitutes â€œextraneous information or influenceâ€ and \r\n  urges this court to remand the case for a new trial.Â  We disagree and find that \r\n  the erroneous sentencing information resulted from internal jury misconduct, \r\n  and because the misconduct did not violate Galbreathâ€™s due process rights, we \r\n  find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s denial of Galbreathâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â Â  \r\n  \r\nTraditionally, a jurorâ€™s testimony \r\n  was not admissible to prove either his own misconduct or the misconduct of other \r\n  jurors. State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 310, 509 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1999).Â  \r\n  However, Rule 606(b), SCRE altered this common law rule, and now, juror testimony \r\n  regarding external prejudical information or improper outside influence is allowed.Â  \r\n  The rule was further altered by State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 463 S.E.2d \r\n  314 (1995), which dealt with allegations of racial prejudice by the jury.Â  Hunter \r\n  carved out an exception to the rule against juror testimony regarding internal \r\n  jury deliberations, holding that juror testimony is competent in cases involving \r\n  internal misconduct where necessary to ensure fundamental fairness.Â  Id., \r\n  320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316.\r\nExternal influence on a jury involves \r\n  situations where jurors receive information during deliberations from some outside \r\n  source.Â  See State v. Robinson, 443 S.E.2d 306, 329 (N.C. 1994) \r\n  (defining external influences as â€œinformation dealing with the defendant or \r\n  the case which is being tried, which information reaches a juror without being \r\n  introduced in evidence,â€ but excluding â€œinformation which a juror has gained \r\n  in his experienceâ€).Â  For example, in State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d 626 (2000), a juror consulted Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary for the definitions \r\n  of â€œmalice aforethoughtâ€ and â€œmanslaughterâ€ during the course of deliberations.Â  \r\n  The supreme court weighed the three factors our courts use to determine whether \r\n  outside influences have affected the jury, and found that the lone jurorâ€™s use \r\n  of the dictionary, which merely reiterated definitions the trial court had given, \r\n  did not affect the verdict.Â  Likewise, in State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, \r\n  502 S.E.2d 99 (1998), the supreme court determined that no new trial was necessary \r\n  where a religious pamphlet about Godâ€™s view of the death penalty circulated \r\n  in the jury room because there was no evidence the extraneous information affected \r\n  the juryâ€™s verdict.\r\nHere, there is no allegation that \r\n  the incorrect sentencing information came from some extraneous source.Â  Rather, \r\n  it was given to the jury from a fellow juror, who had acquired the information \r\n  from her own personal experience.Â  See State v. Robinson, 443 \r\n  S.E.2d at 329 (defining internal influences as â€œinformation coming from the \r\n  jurors themselvesâ€).Â  Because the affidavits of Juror Owens and Juror Ellenburg \r\n  concern internal jury deliberations, they can only be reviewed if the allegations \r\n  suggest that fundamental fairness, i.e. due process was denied.Â  Hunter, \r\n  320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316.Â  Thus, for this court to find that a new \r\n  trial is warranted, we would have to find that Galbreath was denied due process \r\n  because jurors mistakenly believed he would not serve jail time if convicted \r\n  of ABHAN.\r\nIn South Carolina determining guilt \r\n  or innocence is the duty of the jury, whereas sentencing is the duty of the \r\n  court.Â  A number of courts in other jurisdictions have dealt with allegations \r\n  that jurors were misinformed about possible sentences, and in none of those \r\n  cases did this misinformation result in a court overturning a verdict.Â  See, \r\n  e.g.,Â  Fullwood v. Lee, 290 F.3d 663, 684&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2002) \r\n  (holding that when a juror informs the jury about his understanding that a capital \r\n  murder defendant would serve less than life if sentenced to life, such information \r\n  relates to the jury's internal discussions and may not be used to upend a verdict); \r\n  Dobbs v. Zant, 963 F.2d 1403, 1411&nbsp;(11th Cir. 1991), revâ€™d on \r\n  other grounds, 506 U.S. 357 (1993) (barring juror testimony that jurors \r\n  voted to impose death penalty under mistaken impression that defendant would \r\n  not be executed); Robinson, 443 S.E.2d at 329-330 (holding that allegations \r\n  jurors considered defendantâ€™s possibility of parole are allegations of internal \r\n  influences and will not be considered); Lewis v. State, 549 S.E.2d 732, \r\n  736 (Ga. Ct. App. 2001) (refusing to hear testimony from jurors that they believed \r\n  defendant would receive probation if convicted).Â  While none of these cases \r\n  specifically identified and analyzed the issue as one of fundamental fairness, \r\n  the results suggest that fundamental fairness is not automatically violated \r\n  when a jury considers and is mistaken about sentencing implications.\r\nAlthough a juryâ€™s consideration of \r\n  sentencing consequences may, in some situations, affect the fundamental fairness \r\n  of a trial, we do not believe the allegations in this case support such a finding.Â  \r\n  Here, the jurorsâ€™ affidavits assert that they would have reviewed the elements \r\n  of ABHAN again if they had known Galbreath would be incarcerated. Â This \r\n  allegation makes clear that, prior to rendering its verdict, the jury determined \r\n  Galbreathâ€™s actions met the elements of ABHAN.Â  Thus, there is no evidence Galbreathâ€™s \r\n  due process rights were violated.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm trial courtâ€™s \r\ndenial of a motion for a new trial.Â    \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In Kelly, a capital case, a juror had once attended a death \r\n    penalty rally and did not disclose this information when he was asked about \r\n    his position on the death penalty.Â  The court found no misconduct and stated \r\n    that: â€œJuror P was not specifically asked if he had participated in death \r\n    penalty activities in the past.â€Â  331 S.C. at 146, 509 S.E.2d at 107.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  â€œWe hold that intentional concealment occurs when the question presented \r\n    to the jury on voir dire is reasonably comprehensible to the average juror \r\n    and the subject of the inquiry is of such significance that the jurorâ€™s failure \r\n    to respond is unreasonable.â€Â  Woods, 345 S.C. at 588, 550 S.E.2d at \r\n    284.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3813","title":"Bursey v.

English, of \r\n          Greenville, for Respondent Mining Association of South Carolina.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  The South Carolina \r\n  Department of Health and Environmental Control (â€œDHECâ€) and the South Carolina \r\n  Electric and Gas Company (â€œSCE&amp;Gâ€) appeal a Circuit Court order affirming \r\n  the decision of the South Carolina Mining Council.Â  The Mining Council, deciding \r\n  an appeal of a DHEC determination that SCE&amp;G would not be required to obtain \r\n  a mining permit in connection with its Lake Murray Dam remediation project (also \r\n  referred to in various documents and briefs as the Saluda River Dam remediation \r\n  project), ruled that SCE&amp;G was required to obtain a mining permit.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nSCE&amp;G is currently engaged in \r\n  a dam remediation project, which includes construction of a back-up dam for \r\n  the existing Saluda Dam at Lake Murray in Lexington County, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  The erection of this back-up dam is to be accomplished by mining materials from \r\n  the construction site for use in the damâ€™s construction.Â  The quarry \r\n  mined for this construction will cover from ten to sixty acres and possibly \r\n  constitute the largest quarry in South Carolina upon completion.Â  Activities \r\n  in connection with this project will include exploration of the land for suitable \r\n  materials, blasting, de-watering, crushing raw materials, and the production \r\n  of concrete.Â  All activities associated with this mining and construction \r\n  will be conducted at the SCE&amp;G site.Â  None of the mined material will be \r\n  used for off-site purposes or sold to third parties.\r\nBy letter dated May 15, 2001, SCE&amp;G \r\n  requested from DHEC a â€œletter of verificationâ€ stating that SCE&amp;G was not \r\n  required to obtain a mine operating permit for this project.Â  Craig Kennedy, \r\n  Assistant Division Director for the Division of Mining and Solid Waste Management, \r\n  responded in a June 5, 2001, letter that, because the mining proposed by SCE&amp;G \r\n  fell within an exception to the South Carolina Mining Act (â€œthe Actâ€), [2]  SCE&amp;G was not required to obtain a mine operating permit \r\n  for the project.Â  Kennedy based his finding on the following language of the \r\n  Act:\r\n \r\n  (1) â€œMiningâ€ means:\r\n   \r\n    (a) the breaking of the surface \r\n      soil to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of ores or mineral \r\n      solids for sale or processing or consumption in the regular operation of \r\n      a business;\r\n    (b) removal of overburden lying \r\n      above natural deposits of ore or mineral solids and removal of the mineral \r\n      deposits exposed . . . .\r\n    . . . Mining does not include \r\n      excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on-site farming or \r\n      of on-site construction.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-40(1) (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  Kennedy concluded: â€œ[A] mine operating permit is not required \r\n  for landowners excavating on their own property [when] all the excavated material \r\n  is used on that same tract of land or contiguous tracts of land by the same \r\n  land owner.â€Â  Because Kennedy determined the proposed project constituted â€œon-site \r\n  constructionâ€ as contemplated by the Act, DHEC did not require SCE&amp;G to \r\n  acquire a mine operating permit.\r\nThe Mining Association of South Carolina \r\n  (â€œMASCâ€) and Brett Bursey (collectively, â€œRespondentsâ€) appealed the DHEC decision \r\n  to the Mining Council, a quasi-judicial body established by statute for the \r\n  purpose of, among other things, hearing appeals of agency decisions related \r\n  to mine operating permits.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-20-40(2), 48-20-190, \r\n  48-21-10, 48-21-20 (1987 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  Burseyâ€™s appeal, dated October \r\n  17, 2001, was received on October 22.Â  MASCâ€™s appeal, dated October 19, 2001, \r\n  was received on October 26.\r\nSCE&amp;G and DHEC filed motions \r\n  with the Mining Council to dismiss the appeals on the ground that they were \r\n  filed more than thirty days after Respondents had notice of the decision not \r\n  to require a permit.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-190 (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe \r\n  person taking the appeal within thirty days after the departmentâ€™s decision \r\n  shall give written notice to the council through its secretary that he desires \r\n  to appeal and filing a copy of the notice with the department at the same time.â€); \r\n  26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 89-290(B) (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe person taking the appeal \r\n  shall within thirty days after notification of the Departmentâ€™s decision, give \r\n  written notice to the Mining Council through its secretary that he desires to \r\n  take an appeal, at the same time filing a copy of the notice with the Department.â€).Â  \r\n  The Mining Council denied the motions to dismiss and reversed DHECâ€™s decision, \r\n  ruling that the SCE&amp;G project required a mining permit under the Act.\r\nSCE&amp;G and DHEC (collectively, \r\n  â€œAppellantsâ€) appealed the Mining Councilâ€™s ruling to the Circuit Court.Â  The \r\n  court, applying the Administrative Procedures Actâ€™s (the â€œAPAâ€) â€œsubstantial \r\n  evidenceâ€ standard of review, affirmed the Councilâ€™s rulings on both the timeliness \r\n  of the appeals and the interpretation of the Act requiring SCE&amp;G to obtain \r\n  a mine operating permit.\r\nISSUES\r\n \r\n  \r\n    I.Â  Did the Circuit Court err \r\n      in applying the APAâ€™s â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard of review?\r\n    II.Â  Did the Circuit Court err \r\n      in affirming the Mining Councilâ€™s findings that Respondentsâ€™ appeals were \r\n      timely?\r\n    III.Â  Did the Circuit Court err \r\n      in affirming the Mining Councilâ€™s conclusion that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s proposed activities \r\n      require a mine operating permit?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Standard of Review\r\nAppellants argue the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in applying the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard of review enunciated in \r\n  the APA.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).Â  Appellants \r\n  contend the Mining Act, via the Actâ€™s reference to â€œChapter 7 of Title 18,â€ \r\n  mandates a broader standard.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-200 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA directly affected party, aggrieved \r\n  by a DHEC determination to grant a mine operating permit, may appeal the decision \r\n  to grant said permit to the Mining Council. \r\n  [3] Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-190 (Supp. 2003).Â  A party is then granted \r\n  the right to appeal the ruling of the Mining Council to the Circuit Court.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-200 (Supp. 2003).Â  Section 48-20-200 requires that this \r\n  appeal be taken â€œin the manner provided by Chapter 7 of Title 18.â€Â  Id.\r\nChapter 7 of Title 18 generally deals \r\n  with appeals to the Circuit Court from lower courts, namely the Magistrateâ€™s \r\n  Court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-10 (1985).Â  The chapter mainly concerns \r\n  the procedural process these appeals are to follow when seeking review by the \r\n  Circuit Court.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-20 (Supp. 2003) \r\n  (granting thirty days from the date of the notice of the judgment in which to \r\n  file a written notice of appeal to the Circuit Court).Â  In addition, the chapter \r\n  includes a general jurisdictional statute, section 18-7-10.Â  The chapter later \r\n  bestows upon the Circuit Court a broad scope of review when hearing appeals \r\n  which fall under this jurisdictional grant.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 \r\n  (1985) (â€œIn giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of \r\n  the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors \r\n  of law or fact.â€); Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 489-90, \r\n  548 S.E.2d 605, 608 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSection 18-7-170 provides that on appeal \r\n  from Magistrateâ€™s Court, the Circuit Court may make its own findings of fact.â€). \r\n  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ assertion that the legislature \r\n  intended Chapter 7â€™s broad standard of review to apply to decisions of the Mining \r\n  Council is unsound.Â  The standard of review in section 18-7-170 is meant only \r\n  to apply in appeals over which the Circuit Court gains jurisdiction solely by \r\n  the jurisdictional grant of section 18-7-10, and not appeals where the courtâ€™s \r\n  jurisdiction is, by virtue of a separate statute, otherwise provided for â€œâ€˜by \r\n  law.â€™â€Â  See Karl Sitte Plumbing Co. v. Darby Dev. Co., 295 S.C. \r\n  70, 76, 367 S.E.2d 162, 165 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œSection 18-7-10 and 18-7-170 . \r\n  . . apply where appeals of inferior courts or jurisdictions are not otherwise \r\n  provided for â€œâ€˜by law.â€™â€).Â  The Circuit Courtâ€™s jurisdiction over decisions \r\n  of the Mining Council is granted by the Mining Act and not section 18-7-10.Â  \r\n  Therefore, this de novo standard of review does not automatically apply.Â  Appeals \r\n  from administrative agencies instead typically fall under the APA and its â€œsubstantial \r\n  evidenceâ€ standard of review.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2003); \r\n  Waters v. South Carolina Land Res. Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, \r\n  467 S.E.2d 913 (1996).\r\nIn Waters v. South Carolina Land \r\n  Resources Conservation Commission, the South Carolina Land Resources Conservation \r\n  Commission (SCLRCC) granted J.M. Huber Corporation a permit to mine kaolin in \r\n  Lexington County.Â  The South Carolina Mining Council affirmed SCLRCCâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  An appeal was filed in the Circuit Court seeking review of the Mining Council \r\n  order.Â  The Circuit Court upheld the decision of SCLRCC and the Mining Council.Â  \r\n  On appeal, our Supreme Court applied the Administrative Procedures Act for appellate \r\n  review purposes:\r\n \r\n  This courtâ€™s review of an administrative \r\n    agencyâ€™s findings of fact are limited.Â  The court â€œshall not substitute its \r\n    judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n    of fact.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 1994).Â  A court can reverse \r\n    an agencyâ€™s findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions only if they are, \r\n    as appellants here argue, â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, \r\n    and substantial evidence on the whole record,â€ or â€œarbitrary or capricious \r\n    or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of \r\n    discretion.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e), -380(6)(f) (Supp. 1994).\r\n  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a \r\n    mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed blindly from one side, but \r\n    is evidence which, when considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n    minds to reach the conclusion that the agency reached.â€Â  Palmetto Alliance, \r\n    Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d \r\n    695, 696 (1984).Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions \r\n    from the evidence will not mean the agencyâ€™s conclusion was unsupported by \r\n    substantial evidence.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, the burden is on appellants \r\n    to prove convincingly that the agencyâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence.Â  \r\n    See Hamm v. AT &amp; T, 302 S.C. 210, 394 S.E.2d 842 (1990).\r\n  Applying these principles to the \r\n    instant case, we find the record contained â€œsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable \r\n    mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusionâ€ that Huberâ€™s mining \r\n    operation would not cause an increase in the radioactive level of the water \r\n    supply.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Retardation v. Glenn, 291 S.C. \r\n    279, 281, 353 S.E.2d 284, 286 (1987).Â  The fact that Kennedy relied on circumstantial \r\n    rather than direct evidence in forming his conclusions goes to the weight \r\n    of the evidence.Â  See Bilton v. Best Western Royal Motor Lodge, \r\n    282 S.C. 634, 321 S.E.2d 63 (Ct. App. 1984) (circumstantial evidence and inferences \r\n    drawn therefrom may be relied on to support a finding of fact of an administrative \r\n    agency); see also Palmetto Alliance, Inc., 282 S.C. at 433, \r\n    319 S.E.2d at 697 (an agencyâ€™s findings cannot be overturned â€œunless there \r\n    is no reasonable probability that the facts could be as related by [the] witness \r\n    upon whose testimony the finding is basedâ€).Â  Thus, the agencyâ€™s decision \r\n    was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor characterized by an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n    See Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 354 S.E.2d 565 (1987) (an \r\n    abuse of discretion occurs when a factual ruling is without evidentiary support).\r\n\r\nId. at 226-27, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  at 917 (footnotes omitted).\r\nAppellants assert that the standard \r\n  of review was not a litigated issue in Waters.Â  In applying the APA as \r\n  a standard of review in Waters, our Supreme Court apodictically gave \r\n  implicit and tacit approbation to the efficacy and applicability of the APA \r\n  in an appeal from a Mining Council order.\r\nThe Mining Actâ€™s absence of a statute \r\n  specifically prescribing a standard of review does not mandate that the Circuit \r\n  Court apply a generalized standard found in a broadly referenced chapter of \r\n  the Code, but rather manifests the intent of the General Assembly that the standard \r\n  of review not depend â€œâ€˜upon which appellate court is to determine the appeal.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Karl Sitte Plumbing Co. v. Darby Dev. Co., 295 S.C. 70, 76, 367 S.E.2d \r\n  162, 166 (Ct. App. 1988) (quoting May v. Hopkinson, 289 S.C. 549, 347 \r\n  S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  It is abundantly clear our Supreme Court has applied \r\n  the APAâ€™s â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard of review to appeals from Mining Council \r\n  decisions.Â  Concomitantly, the adoption of Appellantsâ€™ arguments would vary \r\n  the applicable standard of review from appellate court to appellate court and \r\n  contradict this legislative intent.Â  See Waters, 321 S.C. at 226-27, \r\n  467 S.E.2d at 917 (unmistakably applying the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard \r\n  found in the APA to an appeal of a Mining Council decision).Â  We conclude the \r\n  language of section 48-20-200â€”appeals may be taken â€œin the manner provided by \r\n  Chapter 7 of Title 18â€â€”offers one seeking appeal of a Mining Council decision \r\n  the procedural guidelines for doing so and does not convey to the Circuit Court \r\n  the Chapterâ€™s broad standard of review.\r\nThe APA defines â€œ[a]gencyâ€ as â€œeach \r\n  state board, commission, department, executive department or officer . . . authorized \r\n  by law to make regulations or to determine contested cases.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 1-23-10(1)Â  (Supp. 2003).Â  Because the Mining Council is a commission authorized \r\n  by law to determine contested cases concerning mine operating permits, it is \r\n  an agency under the APAâ€™s definition.Â  Thus, appeals from the Mining Councilâ€™s \r\n  decisions are properly decided under the APAâ€™s standard of review.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., Waters, 321 S.C. at 226-27, 467 S.E.2d at 917.\r\nWe find no error in the Circuit Courtâ€™s \r\n  application of the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard of review to the Mining Councilâ€™s \r\n  decision.Â  Not only does the APA control the scope of review utilized by the \r\n  Circuit Court, but it also requires this Court to apply the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ \r\n  standard to this appeal.\r\nUnder the scope of review established \r\n  in the APA, this Court â€œshall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€Â  S.C.

App. 2003).\r\nII.Â  Timeliness of \r\n  the Appeals\r\nAppellants maintain the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in affirming the Mining Councilâ€™s finding that Respondentsâ€™ appeals were \r\n  timely.Â  We disagree.\r\nRespondentsâ€™ arguments related to \r\n  timeliness arise from the portion of the Mining Act that provides:\r\n\r\n  The person taking the appeal within \r\n    thirty days after the departmentâ€™s decision shall give written notice \r\n    to the council through its secretary that he desires to appeal and filing \r\n    a copy of the notice with the department at the same time.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-190 (Supp. \r\n  2003) (emphasis added).Â  While the language of the Mining Act seems to require \r\n  notice of appeal to be filed within thirty days of the actual decision, the \r\n  Actâ€™s concomitant regulations state that the triggering point for the thirty-day \r\n  clock is the date of notice of the DHEC decision.Â  See 26 S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Regs. 89-290(B) (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe person taking the appeal shall within thirty \r\n  days after notification of the Departmentâ€™s decision, give written notice \r\n  to the Mining Council through its secretary that he desires to take an appeal, \r\n  at the same time filing a copy of the notice with the Department.â€) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The Act contains strict public notice requirements regarding the grant \r\n  of a mine operating permit which make the date of notice easy to determine in \r\n  those situations.Â  SeeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-70 (Supp. 2003).Â  However, \r\n  because the triggering occurrence in the case at bar could be classified as \r\n  a non-event (the decision not to require SCE&amp;G to obtain a permit), concepts \r\n  of general fairness required the Mining Council to determine the time Respondents \r\n  received actual notice that DHEC had made the final decision not to require \r\n  a permit before starting the thirty day clock.\r\nA.Â  The Bursey Appeal\r\nAppellants claim that a conversation \r\n  between Bursey and a DHEC employeeâ€”Craig Kennedy, Assistant Division Director \r\n  for the Division of Mining and Solid Waste Managementâ€”provided Bursey with notice \r\n  of the DHEC decision well before thirty days prior to the filing of his notice \r\n  of appeal.Â  As evidence of Burseyâ€™s knowledge of the DHEC decision, Appellants \r\n  presented a letter from Bursey to DHEC dated June 29, 2001, which stated in \r\n  part: â€œIt is my understanding that DHEC staff has determined that the quarry \r\n  operation need not be permitted.â€Â  Appellants allege that this letter constitutes \r\n  proof of Burseyâ€™s actual notice of the decision almost four months prior to \r\n  the filing of his notice of appeal.Â  Yet, a closer look at the entirety of the \r\n  record reveals that this letter is not exactly the â€œsmoking gunâ€ Appellants \r\n  claim.\r\nWhile the letter does convey Burseyâ€™s \r\n  knowledge that some â€œstaffâ€ at DHEC made a cursory decision not to require a \r\n  permit, the letter as a whole seems to concern a â€œstorm water permitâ€ and makes \r\n  no mention of a mine operating permit.Â  At trial, Bursey declared he did not \r\n  have knowledge of a final decision until October 15 and this letter was merely \r\n  an unanswered request for more information about DHECâ€™s determinations in regard \r\n  to the SCE&amp;G project.Â  The language of the letter supports this view of \r\n  the evidence.Â  DHEC did not respond to the letter with any finalized determinations \r\n  about the project.Â  Consequently, the date of Burseyâ€™s actual notice of the \r\n  decision not to require a mine operating permit remains a disputed issue of \r\n  fact.\r\nBecause evidence was presented on \r\n  the issue, the final determination by the Mining Council was essentially based \r\n  on the weight the Council placed on conflicting evidence.Â  Pursuant to this \r\n  Courtâ€™s scope of review, we â€œshall not substitute [our] judgment for that of \r\n  the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€Â  Waters, \r\n  321 S.C. at 226, 467 S.E.2d at 917 (citing S.C.

Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. \r\n  2003)).Â  We affirm the decision of the Circuit Court as to the timeliness of \r\n  Burseyâ€™s appeal.\r\nB.Â  The MASC Appeal\r\nAppellants aver that a telephone \r\n  conversation between a MASC official and a DHEC employee constituted actual \r\n  notice of the DHEC decision not to require a mine operating permit more than \r\n  thirty days prior to the filing of MASCâ€™s notice of appeal.Â  Craig Kennedy, \r\n  of DHEC, testified the decision was discussed with a MASC official in a telephone \r\n  conversation on or around September 10, 2001.Â  The record reveals that \r\n  the communication of this decision was equivocal.Â  Kennedy stated that he agreed \r\n  to discuss the matter further with his supervisors.Â  The MASC official reasonably \r\n  interpreted this communication to mean that a final determination had yet to \r\n  be made.Â  The MASC official testified he did not receive notice of a final decision \r\n  until September 27, within thirty days of his appeal.\r\nThe issue of timeliness as to the \r\n  MASC appeal was a disputed issue of fact, with substantial evidence presented \r\n  to the Mining Council on the issue.Â  In weighing the conflicting evidence, the \r\n  Council determined the MASC officialâ€™s testimony was more credible and concluded, \r\n  as a factual matter, the MASC appeal was timely filed.\r\nIn appeals of agency decisions, the \r\n  agencyâ€™s factual findings are presumed correct and will be set aside only if \r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human \r\n  Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 198, 456 S.E.2d 892 (1995).Â  A record review \r\n  reveals that substantial evidence supports the decision.Â  The Mining Council \r\n  acted within its authority in determining the MASC appeal was timely filed.Â  \r\n  We affirm the decision of the Circuit Court as to the timeliness of MASCâ€™s appeal.\r\nIII.Â  The Mine Operating \r\n  Permit\r\nAppellants argue the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in affirming the decision of the Mining Council requiring SCE&amp;G to \r\n  obtain a mine operating permit.Â  Appellants contend the record supports only \r\n  one conclusion: the activities of SCE&amp;G regarding its dam remediation project \r\n  are exempted from the definition of â€œminingâ€ by virtue of being excavation conducted \r\n  solely in aid of on-site construction.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appellants rely on the \r\n  part of the Mining Act which, in defining what constitutes â€œminingâ€ under the \r\n  Act, states: â€œMining does not include excavation or grading when conducted solely \r\n  in aid of on-site farming or of on-site construction.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-40(1) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Under Appellantsâ€™ interpretation of the Act, the plain meaning \r\n  of the exception dictates that any mine-related activities conducted solely \r\n  in aid of on-site construction do not require a permit.Â  See Ferguson \r\n  v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 97 \r\n  (2002) (â€œWhen the statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous, there is no room \r\n  for an alternate construction, and courts must apply them according to their \r\n  literal meaning.â€).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At issue here is the definition \r\n  of the word â€œexcavation.â€Â  While not defined in the statute, the parties submit \r\n  that the literal definition of â€œexcavationâ€ is akin to that of â€œdigging.â€Â  The \r\n  Mining Council heard extensive testimony that the SCE&amp;G project, while involving \r\n  a substantial amount of â€œexcavation,â€ would include blasting with dynamite, \r\n  de-watering, crushing, stockpiling, and making concrete.Â  The Actâ€™s broad \r\n  definition of â€œminingâ€ reads in part: â€œthe breaking of the surface soil to facilitate \r\n  or accomplish the extraction or removal of ores or mineral solids for sale or \r\n  processing or consumption in the regular operation of a business.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 48-20-40(1)(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  There is substantial evidence in the record \r\n  that the activities of SCE&amp;G, while clearly falling under the Actâ€™s broad \r\n  definition of â€œmining,â€ go beyond mere â€œexcavationâ€ as contemplated in the exception.\r\nWe conclude Appellants, no matter \r\n  how tenable their position on this issue, have failed to show the decision of \r\n  the Mining Council was â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative \r\n  and substantial evidence on the whole record,â€ or â€œarbitrary or capricious or \r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e), (f) (Supp. 2003); Waters, 321 S.C. \r\n  at 226, 467 S.E.2d at 917.Â  The Circuit Court ruled: â€œIt was not arbitrary and \r\n  capricious, nor an abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s view for a group of experts \r\n  in the field of mining to look at a project to construct the biggest quarry \r\n  in South Carolina and determine that it is more than excavation in aid of on-site \r\n  construction.â€Â  We find the record contained â€œâ€˜such relevant evidence as a reasonable \r\n  mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusionâ€™â€ that the project went \r\n  beyond the exception and required a mine operating permit.Â  See Waters, \r\n  321 S.C. at 226, 467 S.E.2d at 917 (quoting South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental \r\n  Retardation v. Glenn, 291 S.C. 279, 353 S.E.2d 284 (1987)).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the Circuit Court correctly \r\n  applied the APAâ€™s â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard of review to the appeal from \r\n  the Mining Councilâ€™s order.Â  There exists on the record substantial evidence \r\n  to support the order of the Mining Council.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the \r\n  Circuit Court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  S.C.

(Beckmann) brought suit against United Fire and Casualty Co. (United) to \r\n  collect on a payment bond that United issued to Golf Construction of America \r\n  (Golf Construction).Â  United was found in default for failing to file an answer.Â  \r\n  The court entered a default judgment against United.Â  United moved for relief \r\n  from the judgment alleging it did not receive notice under Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP, \r\n  and contending it was entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  The court \r\n  denied the motion.Â  We vacate and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGolf Construction was employed to perform work at the Golf Club at Westcott \r\n  Plantation.Â  United supplied a payment bond to Golf Construction in the amount \r\n  of $367,373.06 for the amount of the contract.Â  The contract required Golf Construction \r\n  to perform clearing, grubbing, and silt fence installation.Â  Subsequently, the \r\n  work to be performed by Golf Construction was expanded.Â  However, United did \r\n  not provide any additional payment bond, nor was the scope of its bond expanded \r\n  to include the additional work of bridge construction or concrete work.\r\nBeckmann was a subcontractor hired to work on the concrete golf cart paths.Â  \r\n  In a letter, Beckmann notified United that it was asserting a claim on the payment \r\n  bond.Â  United denied the claim and maintains that it owes nothing under the \r\n  bond for the work performed by Beckmann.Â  Beckmann subsequently filed a Summons \r\n  and Complaint, alleging United issued a payment bond and is liable under that \r\n  bond for the work performed by Beckmann.Â  Beckmann averred it is owed $80,938.25.\r\nBeckmannâ€™s counsel filed an Affidavit of Default, claiming United had failed \r\n  to answer the complaint and failed to serve a notice of appearance.Â  Beckmann \r\n  filed a Certification and Petition for Default Judgment which iterated its claim \r\n  of damages in the amount of $80,938.25, asserted the damages were liquidated \r\n  damages, and claimed to have attached supporting documentation for the damages.Â  \r\n  The Certification and Petition for Default Judgment provided:\r\n\r\n  The undersigned attorney for Plaintiff hereby certifies that this application \r\n    for default judgment, pursuant to Rule 55, SCRCP, against United Fire and \r\n    Casualty Company is based upon a complaint alleging a cause of action based \r\n    upon a liquidated debt; and further certifies that the following documents \r\n    are either attached or have been filed with the Clerk of Court in support \r\n    of the foregoing, to wit:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n    a.\r\n    Summons and complaint;\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    b.\r\n    Proper proof of legal service upon the defendant, United Fire \r\n      and Casualty Company;\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    c.\r\n    Proper documentation supporting liquidated demand in the amount \r\n      of eighty thousand nine hundred thirty-eight dollars and twenty-five cents \r\n      ($80,938.25) set forth in complaint as provided by statute; together with \r\n      proper documentation for award of attorneyâ€™s fees and interest, if applicable, \r\n      pursuant to the terms of a written agreement; and\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    d.Â \r\n    Affidavit of Default.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe court entered an order of default judgment against United and awarded $80,938.25 \r\n  to Beckmann.Â  United filed a motion for relief from the default judgment.Â  United \r\n  argued notice was required under Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP, because the damages were \r\n  not liquidated or sum certain damages.Â  Additionally, United contended the judgment \r\n  should be set aside under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, or Rule 55(c), SCRCP, because \r\n  the failure to answer was the result of excusable neglect or good cause.\r\nThe court found the claim was for liquidated damages \r\n  and, therefore, notice was not required.Â  The court concluded the reasons alleged \r\n  by United for failing to file an answer were neither â€œexcusable neglectâ€ under \r\n  Rule 60(b)(1) nor â€œgood causeâ€ under Rule 55(c).\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe power to set aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial court whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear \r\n  showing of an abuse of that discretion.Â  Frank Ulmer Lumber Co. v. Patterson, \r\n  272 S.C. 208, 250 S.E.2d 121 (1978); In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. \r\n  251, 495 S.E.2d 454 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion in setting aside \r\n  a default judgment occurs when the judge issuing the order was controlled by \r\n  some error of law or when the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from \r\n  legal conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Estate of Weeks, \r\n  329 S.C. at 259, 495 S.E.2d at 459.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Unliquidated Damages\r\nUnited claims the damages alleged by Beckmann were not liquidated damages and \r\n  Beckmann did not follow the procedure mandated by Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP, in regard \r\n  to unliquidated damages.Â  United argues the damages were unliquidated and, therefore, \r\n  it was entitled to notice of the damages hearing.\r\nWhen the defendant has not answered or otherwise appeared, there is no requirement \r\n  that notice be given before entering a default judgment.Â  See Rule 55(b), \r\n  SCRCP; Roche v. Young Brothers, Inc., 318 S.C. 207, 456 S.E.2d 897 (1995).Â  \r\n  However, when the relief which is sought is unliquidated damages, Rule 5(a) \r\n  specifically states that â€œnotice of any trial or hearing on unliquidated damages \r\n  shall also be given to parties in default.â€Â  Rule 5(a), SCRCP.\r\nIn Lewis v. Congress of Racial Equality, 275 S.C. 556, 274 S.E.2d 287 \r\n  (1981), our Supreme Court declared: â€œIn liquidated-damages cases, the amount \r\n  is usually a sum certain, or at least the amount is capable of ascertainment \r\n  by computation.â€Â  Id. at 560, 274 S.E.2d at 289.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n  defines liquidated damages as â€œ[a]n amount contractually stipulatedâ€ in contrast \r\n  to unliquidated damages which are â€œ[d]amages that . . . cannot be determined \r\n  by a fixed formula, so they are left to the discretion of the judge or jury.â€Â  \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 395-97 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Liquidated damages â€œare \r\n  damages the amount of which has been made certain and fixed either by the act \r\n  and agreement of the parties or by operation of law to a sum which cannot be \r\n  changed by the proof.â€Â  22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages Â§ 489 (2003).Â  â€œThey are \r\n  also defined as damages the amount of which has been ascertained by judgment \r\n  or by the specific agreement of the parties or which are susceptible of being \r\n  made certain by mathematical calculation from known factors.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn \r\n  general, damages are unliquidated where they are an uncertain quantity, depending \r\n  on no fixed standard, referred to the wise discretion of a jury, and can never \r\n  be made certain except by accord or verdict.â€Â  Id.\r\nA â€œliquidated claimâ€ is â€œ[a] claim for an amount \r\n  previously agreed on by the parties or that can be precisely determined by operation \r\n  of law or by the terms of the partiesâ€™ agreement.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n  240.Â  Finally, an â€œunliquidated claimâ€ is defined as â€œ[a] claim in which the \r\n  liability of the party or the amount of the claim is in dispute.â€Â  Id.\r\nBeckmann filed its complaint alleging its right to collect on the payment bond \r\n  provided by United.Â  Beckmann specifically asked for â€œeighty thousand nine hundred \r\n  thirty-eight dollars and twenty-five cents ($80,938.25), plus a reasonable attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee as determined by the Court, interest in an amount to be proven at trial, \r\n  and whatever other relief might be proper.â€Â  There is no indication this is \r\n  an amount agreed upon by the parties.\r\nAdditionally, the claim was clearly in dispute.Â  When Beckmann first asserted \r\n  its right to collect on Unitedâ€™s payment bond, United denied the claim pending \r\n  further information.Â  United maintained the information provided indicated the \r\n  claim was outside the scope of the bond provided by United to Golf Construction.\r\nIn Hecht Realty, Inc. v. Hastings, 262 S.E.2d 858 (N.C. Ct. App. 1980), \r\n  the Court of Appeals of North Carolina discussed whether a claim was for liquidated \r\n  damages:\r\n\r\n  The mere demand for judgment of a specified dollar amount does not suffice \r\n    to make plaintiffâ€™s claim one for â€œa sum certainâ€ as contemplated by Rule \r\n    55(b).Â  Such a demand is normally included in the prayer for relief in \r\n    every complaint in which monetary damages are sought, including complaints \r\n    alleging claims for damages for bodily injuries caused by a defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  \r\n    The complaint in the present case alleged a breach of contract by the defendant, \r\n    but nothing in the allegations of the complaint makes it possible to compute \r\n    the amount of damages to which plaintiff is entitled by reason of the breach.\r\n\r\nId. at 859-60 (emphasis added).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial court erred in finding the claim made by Beckmann was for liquidated \r\n  damages or a sum certain.\r\nThe claim by Beckmann was for unliquidated damages.Â  \r\n  In the case of unliquidated damages, Rule 55(b)(2) states: â€œPursuant to Rule \r\n  5(a), notice of any trial or hearing on unliquidated damages shall also be given \r\n  to parties in default by first class mail to the last known address of such \r\n  party whether or not such party has appeared in the action.â€Â  Rule 55(b)(2), \r\n  SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  Concomitantly, it was improper for the trial court \r\n  to enter a default judgment against United without conducting a damages hearing \r\n  after notice to United pursuant to Rules 55(b)(2) and 5(a).\r\nII.Â  Liquidated Damages\r\nBeckmann asseverates that the claim was one for a sum certain, which could \r\n  be computed by the trial court.Â  United asserts that if the damages were liquidated, \r\n  Beckmann did NOT follow the procedure required by Rule 55(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\nEven if we were to construe the claim as one for \r\n  liquidated damages, Beckmann failed to follow the proper procedure outlined \r\n  in Rule 55(b)(1) for obtaining a default judgment.Â  Rule 55(b)(1) explicates:\r\n\r\n  When the claim of a party seeking judgment by default is for a liquidated \r\n    amount, a sum certain or a sum which can by computation be made certain, the \r\n    judge, upon motion or application of the party seeking default, and upon \r\n    affidavit of the amount due, shall enter judgment for that amount and \r\n    costs against the party against whom judgment by default is sought, if that \r\n    party has been defaulted for failure to appear and if such party is not a \r\n    minor or incompetent person.Â  A verified pleading may be used in lieu of \r\n    an affidavit when the pleading contains information sufficient to determine \r\n    or compute the sum certain.\r\n\r\nRule 55(b)(1), SCRCP (emphasis added).\r\nThe complaint was not a verified pleading.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  Beckmann filed an Affidavit of Default and a â€œCertification and Petition for \r\n  Default Judgmentâ€ (Certification), which stated the claim against United was \r\n  â€œbased upon a liquidated debtâ€ and further asserted various documents were attached.Â  \r\n  The documents do not appear in the record and there is no indication they were \r\n  received by the trial court or attached to the Certification.Â  The Certification \r\n  was not in the form of an affidavit and was not signed by an agent for Beckmann \r\n  but by counsel only in the capacity as attorney.\r\nBeckmann failed to file a verified pleading or \r\n  an affidavit of the amount due.Â  Thus, Beckmann failed to properly present proof \r\n  of the nature of its claims such that the trial court would be able to calculate \r\n  or otherwise verify the amount.\r\nIn the case sub judice, Beckmann did NOT comply with Rule \r\n  55(b)(1), SCRCP: (1) Beckmann did not file a verified pleading or an affidavit; \r\n  and (2) no supporting documents in any form or fashion were attached to the \r\n  Certification or filed in the office of the clerk of court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe claim by Beckmann was for unliquidated damages, requiring complete and \r\n  full compliance with the procedure outlined in Rule 55(b)(2).Â  Beckmann failed \r\n  to follow Rules 55(b)(2) and 5(a).Â  \r\nAlternatively, even if Beckmannâ€™s claim was liquidated, Beckmann did NOT \r\n  follow the mandate of Rule 55(b)(1).\r\nWe vacate the judgment of default and remand to the Circuit \r\n  Court for a damages hearing after proper notice is provided pursuant to Rules \r\n  5(a) and 55(b)(2).\r\nVACATED and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3815","title":"Edens v.

Parr, Jr., both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Susan Edens, \r\n  personal representative of the Estate of Christopher Edens (the Estate), filed \r\n  wrongful death and survival actions against Milliken &amp; Company, and three \r\n  of its employees, Kelvin Statom, Kevin Gingerich, and Dale Coy (collectively, \r\n  Respondents).Â  The trial judge dismissed the claims pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) \r\n  and 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nOn February 10, 1998, during the course of his employment as a subcontractor \r\n  at Milliken's Abbeville plant, Christopher Edens was struck and crushed to death \r\n  by a piece of machinery. Edens' employer, Sanders Brothers, Inc., had assigned \r\n  him to the Abbeville plant where he assisted Milliken employees in various plant-related \r\n  projects for about a year prior to his fatal on-the-job accident. During the \r\n  morning and early afternoon on the day of the accident, Edens had been assisting \r\n  Milliken employees install a cylinder on the door of a dye vat in the robotic \r\n  shuttle area.\r\n\r\nThe area of the plant where the accident occurred had a massive robotic shuttle \r\n  which moved back and forth on tracks to transport wool to and from dye vats \r\n  where the wool was dyed. Along with other safety devices, pressure-sensitive \r\n  &quot;safety mats&quot; were positioned on the floor between the dye vats. Once \r\n  stepped upon, these mats would automatically stop the shuttle's movement.\r\nDepositions of several Milliken employees revealed that, on the morning of \r\n  the accident, Statom, the shuttle operator, had become &quot;aggravated&quot; \r\n  because the safety mats were repeatedly stepped upon, stopping the robotic shuttle. \r\n  As a result, Gingerich, acting on his own volition, disconnected the safety \r\n  mats in his particular area of the plant floor. After disconnecting the mats, \r\n  Gingerich warned Statom that Sanders Brothers employees would be working in \r\n  that area and instructed him not to send the shuttle there. On the few occasions \r\n  when the robotic shuttle approached the portion of the tracks where the employees \r\n  were working on the dye vat project, the individuals working there were asked \r\n  to leave the pathway of the shuttle so that it could pass through.\r\nAfter work on the dye vat in this area was completed, both the Milliken employees \r\n  and subcontractors dispersed. However, the safety mats were not reconnected. \r\n  Later in the day, Edens returned to this dye vat area to check whether there \r\n  was any leakage. The Milliken shuttle operator, unaware anyone was in the vicinity, \r\n  activated the robotic shuttle in the dye vat area. The shuttle pinned Edens \r\n  against a dye vat. He ultimately died from his injuries.\r\n  \r\n  The Estate filed a Workers' Compensation suit against Edens' employer, Sanders \r\n  Brothers, Inc., a mechanical contracting firm. The Workers' Compensation Commission \r\n  awarded the Estate benefits for Edens' accidental death. On August 5, 1999, \r\n  the Estate filed wrongful death and survival actions against various manufacturers \r\n  and distributors of the allegedly defective machinery, averring negligence, \r\n  strict liability, and breach of warranty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 17, 2001, during the discovery process, the Estate moved to amend \r\n  the complaints to include Milliken and individual Milliken employees, Statom, \r\n  Gingerich, and Coy, [2]  as defendants with regard to a negligence cause \r\n  of action. [3] Â  The motion to \r\n  amend was granted. \r\n \r\n\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss the \r\n  claims pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), and 56, SCRCP.Â  The Circuit judge \r\n  granted the motion to dismiss pursuant to (1) Rule 12(b)(1) holding the court \r\n  â€œlack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction because of the exclusivity provisions \r\n  of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act [4]  when there is no evidence that \r\n  [Respondents] deliberately or specifically intended the injury to occurâ€ and \r\n  (2) Rule 56 â€œbecause the statute of limitations expired before [the Estate]â€™s \r\n  causes of action against the [Respondents] were asserted in this Court.â€Â  The \r\n  trial judge then entered judgment for Respondents pursuant to Rule 54(b), SCRCP.\r\n \r\nISSUE \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n    Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n      concluding the Estateâ€™s action was barred by the exclusivity provision of \r\n      the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\n  Coverage under the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n    Act depends on the existence of an employment relationship.Â  McDowell v. \r\n    Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 41 S.E.2d 872 (1947); see also \r\n    Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 184, 528 S.E.2d 435, 441 (Ct. \r\n    App. 2000) (â€œBefore provisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act can apply, \r\n    an employer-employee relationship must exist; this is an initial fact to be \r\n    established.â€).Â  Workersâ€™ Compensation awards are authorized only if an employer-employee \r\n    relationship exists at the time of the injury.Â  Dawkins v. Jordan, \r\n    341 S.C. 434, 534 S.E.2d 700 (2000).\r\n  Whether or not an employer-employee \r\n    relationship exists is a jurisdictional question.Â  Nelson v.

App. 1998) (existence of employer-employee relationship is jurisdictional \r\n    question; injured workerâ€™s employment status, as it affects jurisdiction, \r\n    is matter of law for decision by court and includes findings of fact which \r\n    relate to jurisdiction).Â  The determination of whether a worker is a statutory \r\n    employee is jurisdictional and therefore the question on appeal is one of \r\n    law.Â  Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 523 S.E.2d \r\n    766 (1999); Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, 482 S.E.2d 49 (1997).Â  \r\n    As a result, this Court has the power and duty to review the entire record \r\n    and decide the jurisdictional facts in accord with the preponderance of the \r\n    evidence.Â  Harrell, 337 S.C. at 320, 523 S.E.2d at 769; Glass, \r\n    325 S.C. at 202, 482 S.E.2d at 51; see also Bridges v. Wyandotte \r\n    Worsted Co., 243 S.C. 1, 132 S.E.2d 18 (1963), overruled in part on \r\n    other grounds by Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, \r\n    567 S.E.2d 231 (2002) (existence or absence of employment relationship is \r\n    jurisdictional fact which court must determine based on review of all evidence \r\n    in record).\r\n  Where the issue involves jurisdiction, \r\n    the appellate court can take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n    Nelson, 349 S.C. at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 112.Â  It is South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n    policy to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of employers \r\n    and employees under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Dawkins, 341 S.C. \r\n    at 439, 534 S.E.2d at 703.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The court may consider \r\n    affidavits on a question of law in a jurisdictional motion without converting \r\n    the motion into one for summary judgment.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n    333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999).Â  The proper procedure for raising lack \r\n    of subject matter jurisdiction prior to trial is to file a motion to dismiss \r\n    pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, rather than a motion for summary judgment \r\n    pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, \r\n    460 S.E.2d 392 (1995), overruled on other grounds by Sabb v. South \r\n    Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002).Â  If a party \r\n    files a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment on the ground of lack of subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction, the trial court should treat the motion as if it were \r\n    a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.Â  Id.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI.Â  Exclusivity Provision of the \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act\r\n  The Estate argues the trial judge \r\n    erred in finding the Estateâ€™s action was barred by the exclusivity provision \r\n    of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (the Act).Â  We disagree.\r\n  The Act contains an â€œexclusivity \r\n    provision.â€Â  See Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. \r\n    416, 422, 567 S.E.2d 231, 234 (2002) (â€œBecause Sabbâ€™s claims, as employee \r\n    of University, arose out of and in the course of her employment, the Workersâ€™ \r\n    Compensation Act . . . provides the exclusive remedy for her.â€).Â  This exclusivity \r\n    provision is found at section 42-1-540:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  The rights and remedies granted \r\n    by this Title to an employee when he and his employer have accepted the provisions \r\n    of this Title, respectively, to pay and accept compensation on account \r\n    of personal injury or death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and \r\n    remedies of such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents \r\n    or next of kin as against his employer, at common law or otherwise, on account \r\n    of such injury, loss of service or death.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985) \r\n    (emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is \r\n  the exclusive remedy against an employer for an employeeâ€™s work-related accident \r\n  or injury.Â  Fuller v. Blanchard, Op. No. 3763 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March \r\n  22, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 12 at 16); see also Strickland v. \r\n  Galloway, 348 S.C. 644, 646, 560 S.E.2d 448, 449 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œIn circumstances \r\n  in which the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act covers an employeeâ€™s work-related \r\n  accident, the Act provides the exclusive remedy against the employer.â€).Â  The \r\n  exclusivity provision of the Act precludes an employee from maintaining a tort \r\n  action against an employer where the employee sustains a work-related injury.Â  \r\n  Tatum v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 346 S.C. 194, 552 S.E.2d 18 \r\n  (2001).\r\n  â€œThe exclusive remedy doctrine \r\n    was enacted to balance the relative ease with which the employee can recover \r\n    under the Act: the employee gets swift, sure compensation, and the employer \r\n    receives immunity from tort actions by the employee.â€Â  Strickland, \r\n    348 S.C. at 646, 560 S.E.2d at 449.Â  The immunity is conferred not only on \r\n    the direct employer, but also on co-employees.Â  Id.\r\n  Under the exclusivity provision, \r\n    a Workersâ€™ Compensation action is the exclusive means to determine claims \r\n    against an individualâ€™s employer for work-related accidents and injuries.Â  \r\n    In the instant case, however, Edens was not a Milliken employee.Â  Rather, \r\n    he was employed by Sanders Brothers, and was thus a Milliken subcontractor.\r\n  \r\nCoverage under the Act is generally \r\n  dependent on the existence of an employer-employee relationship.Â  McDowell \r\n  v. Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 41 S.E.2d 872 (1947); Tillotson \r\n  v. Keith Smith Builders, 357 S.C. 554, 593 S.E.2d 621 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  There are certain statutory exceptions to this general rule.Â  One of these exceptions \r\n  is found in Â§ 42-1-400 of the Act which, under some circumstances, imposes liability \r\n  on an employer or business owner for the payment of compensation benefits to \r\n  a worker not directly employed by the employer.Â  The Act specifically provides \r\n  statutory employees are included within the scope of the Act:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  When any person, in this section \r\n    and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 and 42-1-430 referred to as â€œowner,â€ undertakes to perform \r\n    or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and \r\n    contracts with any other person (in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 \r\n    referred to as â€œsubcontractorâ€) for the execution or performance by or under \r\n    such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such \r\n    owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work \r\n    any compensation under this Title which he would have been liable to pay if \r\n    the workman had been immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (1985).\r\n  \r\nThree tests are applied in determining \r\n  whether the activity of an employee of a subcontractor is sufficient to make \r\n  him a statutory employee within the meaning of Â§ 42-1-400:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (1) is the activity an important \r\n    part of the ownerâ€™s business or trade;\r\n  (2) is the activity a necessary, \r\n    essential, and integral part of the ownerâ€™s trade, business, or occupation; \r\n    or\r\n  (3) has the identical activity \r\n    previously been performed by the ownerâ€™s employees?\r\n\r\nBoone v. Huntington and Guerry \r\n  Elec. Co., 311 S.C. 550, 430 S.E.2d 507 (1993); Riden v. Kemet Elec. \r\n  Corp., 313 S.C. 261, 437 S.E.2d 156 (Ct. App. 1993); see also Meyer \r\n  v. Piggly Wiggly No. 24, Inc., 338 S.C. 471, 473, 527 S.E.2d 761, 763 (2000) \r\n  (holding there are three tests used to determine whether an employee was â€œengaged \r\n  in an activity that is part of the ownerâ€™s trade, business, or occupationâ€); \r\n  Smith v. T.H. Snipes and Sons, Inc., 306 S.C. 289, 411 S.E.2d 439 (1991) \r\n  (listing the three factors of the statutory employee test); Revels v. Hoechst \r\n  Celanese Corp., 301 S.C. 316, 318, 391 S.E.2d 731, 732 (Ct. App. 1990) (finding \r\n  the test used to determine if one is a statutory employee is â€œwhether or not \r\n  [the work] being done is or is not a part of the general trade, business or \r\n  occupation of the owner.â€).Â  If the activity at issue meets even one of these \r\n  three criteria, the worker qualifies as the statutory employee of the owner.Â  \r\n  Olmstead v. Shakespeare, 354 S.C. 421, 581 S.E.2d 483 (2003).Â  Any doubts \r\n  as to a workerâ€™s status should be resolved in favor of including him or her \r\n  under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Riden, 313 S.C. at 263, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  at 158.\r\n  Michael McGill, Edensâ€™ supervisor \r\n    at Sanders Brothers, was assigned to Millikenâ€™s Abbeville plant.Â  McGill stated:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  At the time of Mr. Edensâ€™ accident, \r\n    Sandersâ€™ employees primarily assisted Millikenâ€™s maintenance associates when \r\n    they requested assistance.Â  On the morning of the accident, Mr. Edens was \r\n    assisting Milliken associates, under their direction, with a modification \r\n    of a dye vat in the dye package plant.Â  Maintaining operations equipment in \r\n    the dye package plant was an important and necessary part of Millikenâ€™s business \r\n    at the Abbeville Plant.Â  Mr. Edens, like other Sanders employees, assisted \r\n    Milliken associates with various equipment maintenances and modifications \r\n    throughout the dye package plant.Â  With regard to the dye vat modification \r\n    in particular, Mr. Edens did not bring any specific or unique expertise to \r\n    the project.Â  He was there to assist in the work that had to be done that \r\n    morning.\r\n\r\nIn his affidavit, Coy, the engineering \r\n    services manager for the dye package area at Millikenâ€™s Abbeville plant, declared:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the time of Mr. Edensâ€™ \r\n    accident, Milliken used employees from Sanders Brothers, Inc. (â€œSandersâ€) \r\n    to assist Millikenâ€™s maintenance associates on various machinery maintenance \r\n    and installation projects throughout the dye plant.Â  On the morning of the \r\n    accident, February 10, 1998, Mr. Edens was assisting Milliken associates by \r\n    helping to modify the door to a dye vat in the dye package plant.\r\n  3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The work assigned to Mr. \r\n    Edens on the day of the accident in the dye vat area was neither special nor \r\n    unique.Â  He was asked to assist, and was under the direction of, Milliken \r\n    associates when he performed this work.Â  Milliken associates could have performed \r\n    and were in fact also performing the work he was doing that morning, and had \r\n    done similar work in the dye vat area previously without the assistance of \r\n    Mr. Edens or other Sanders employees.\r\n  4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Maintaining operations \r\n    equipment and machinery in the dye package plant and modifying the dye vats \r\n    in the dye package plant to make them more productive were important and necessary \r\n    parts of Millikenâ€™s business at the Abbeville plant.Â  Making the dye vats \r\n    productive was an integral aspect of the dye package plant operations.Â  Therefore, \r\n    the work done to the door of the dye vat at issue was an important part of \r\n    Millikenâ€™s operations in Abbeville.\r\n\r\nThe record reveals that Edensâ€™ \r\n    work on the dye vat project satisfies each of the three criteria which independently \r\n    show that an employee of a subcontractor is a statutory employee under the \r\n    Act.Â  The Circuit judge found that Edens was Millikenâ€™s statutory employee \r\n    on the date of the accident.Â  In this appeal, no issue is raised in regard \r\n    to the status of Edens as Millikenâ€™s statutory employee on the date of the \r\n    accident.\r\n  \r\nBased on the three criteria articulated \r\n  in Meyer, Boone, and Smith, and the conclusion of the Circuit \r\n  judge, we affirm the finding that Edens was Millikenâ€™s statutory employee on \r\n  the date of the accident.\r\n  If a worker is properly classified \r\n    as a statutory employee, his sole remedy for work-related injuries is to seek \r\n    relief under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Hancock v. Wal-Mart Stores, \r\n    Inc., 355 S.C. 168, 584 S.E.2d 398 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  He may not maintain \r\n    a negligence cause of action against his direct employer or his statutory \r\n    employer.Â  Neese v. Michelin Tire Corp., 324 S.C. 465, 478 S.E.2d 91 \r\n    (Ct. App. 1996), overruled on other grounds by Abbott v. The Limited, \r\n    Inc., 338 S.C. 161, 526 S.E.2d 513 (2000).Â  The exclusivity provision \r\n    of the Act applies both to â€œdirectâ€ employees and to those termed â€œstatutory \r\n    employeesâ€ under Â§ 42-1-400.Â  Carter v. Florentine Corp., 310 S.C. \r\n    228, 423 S.E.2d 112 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Ballenger \r\n    v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994).\r\n  Accordingly, the Estateâ€™s sole \r\n    recourse against the Respondents for Edensâ€™ accidental workplace death was \r\n    a Workersâ€™ Compensation recovery.\r\n  \r\nII.Â  Intentional \r\n  Tort Exception to the Act\r\n  The Estate contends it can pursue \r\n    a negligence cause of action in this case based upon the intentional tort \r\n    exception to the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\nAn exception to the exclusivity provision \r\n  exists where the injury is not accidental but rather results from the intentional \r\n  act of the employer or its alter ego.Â  Cason v. Duke Energy Corp., 348 \r\n  S.C. 544, 560 S.E.2d 891 (2002); Dickert v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \r\n  311 S.C. 218, 428 S.E.2d 700 (1993).Â  Our Supreme Court declared:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  The only exceptions to the exclusivity \r\n    provisions are: (1) where the injury results from the act of a subcontractor \r\n    who is not the injured personâ€™s direct employer (Â§ 42-1-540); (2) where the \r\n    injury is not accidental but rather results from the intentional act of the \r\n    employer or its alter ego [Dickert v.

Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; \r\n    D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, Â§ 8 (5th ed. 1984 \r\n    &amp; Supp. 1988).Â  In its most narrow sense, â€œintentâ€ denotes an actorâ€™s \r\n    specific desire to cause the consequences of his act.Â  See Restatement \r\n    (Second) of Torts Â§ 8A (1965).Â  However, â€œintentâ€ may be construed more broadly \r\n    to include consequences which are not desired.Â  Where an actor knows that \r\n    consequences are substantially certain to result from his act and still goes \r\n    ahead, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the \r\n    result.Â  Id. and comment b.Â  With these differing interpretations of \r\n    â€œintentâ€ in mind, we turn to the question whether the intentional injury exception \r\n    to section 42-1-540 includes injuries that are substantially certain to result \r\n    from an employerâ€™s act.\r\n  . . . Giving the intentional \r\n    injury exception to section 42-1-540 its most narrow construction, we find \r\n    that only those injuries inflicted by an employer who acts with a deliberate \r\n    or specific intent to injure are exempted from the exclusive remedy of workersâ€™ \r\n    compensation coverage.Â  Accord 2A Larsonâ€™s, Â§ 68.13.Â  Consequently, \r\n    we decline to follow North Carolinaâ€™s adoption of the substantial certainty \r\n    standard articulated in Woodson v. Rowland, 329 N.C. 330, 407 S.E.2d \r\n    222 (1991).\r\n\r\nId. at 93-94, 437 S.E.2d \r\n    at 65-66 (footnote omitted and emphasis added).Â  The standard articulated \r\n    in Peay regarding employers â€œalso would apply to injuries intentionally \r\n    inflicted by a co-employee.â€Â  Id. at 94 n.1, 437 S.E.2d at 66 n.1.Â  \r\n    Any exception to Workersâ€™ Compensation coverage must be narrowly construed.Â  \r\n    Id. at 94, 437 S.E.2d at 65.\r\n  \r\nIn contrariety to the Estateâ€™s argument, \r\n  Peay is precedential and controlling in regard to the case sub \r\n  judice.Â  Our Supreme Court, in Cason v. Duke Energy Corp., 348 \r\n  S.C. 544, 560 S.E.2d 891 (2002), buttressed, augmented, and maximized the efficacy \r\n  of Peay.\r\n  \r\nIn his treatise on Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  law, Professor Larson academically analyzed the intentional tort exception and \r\n  its restriction to instances when harm is specifically intended:\r\n  \r\n \r\n  Since the legal justification for \r\n    the common-law action is the nonaccidental character of the injury from the \r\n    defendant employerâ€™s standpoint, the common-law liability of the employer \r\n    cannot, under the almost unanimous rule, be stretched to include accidental \r\n    injuries caused by the gross, wanton, willful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, \r\n    culpable, or malicious negligence, breach of statute, or other misconduct \r\n    of the employer short of a conscious and deliberate intent directed to the \r\n    purpose of inflicting an injury.\r\n  Even if the alleged conduct goes \r\n    beyond aggravated negligence, and includes such elements as knowingly permitting \r\n    a hazardous work condition to exist, knowingly ordering employees to perform \r\n    an extremely dangerous job, willfully failing to furnish a safe place to work, \r\n    willfully violating a safety statute, failing to protect employees from crime, \r\n    refusing to respond to an employeeâ€™s medical needs and restrictions, or withholding \r\n    information about worksite hazards, the conduct still falls short of the kind \r\n    of actual intention to injure that robs the injury of accidental character.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  If these decisions seem rather \r\n    strict, one must remind oneself that what is being tested here is not the \r\n    degree of gravity or depravity of the employerâ€™s conduct, but rather the narrow \r\n    issue of the intentional versus the accidental quality of the precise event \r\n    producing injury.Â  The intentional removal of a safety device or toleration \r\n    of a dangerous condition may or may not set the stage for an accidental injury \r\n    later.Â  But in any normal use of the words, it cannot be said, if such an \r\n    injury does happen, that this was deliberate infliction of harm comparable \r\n    to an intentional left jab to the chin.\r\n\r\n6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, \r\n    Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 103.03 (2002) (emphasis added \r\n    and footnotes omitted).\r\n  The Estate cannot show Milliken, \r\n    or any of Millikenâ€™s employees, had â€œa deliberate or specific intent to injureâ€ \r\n    Edens.Â  See Peay, 313 S.C. at 94, 437 S.E.2d at 65-66 (â€œ[O]nly \r\n    those injuries inflicted by an employer [or co-employee] who acts with a deliberate \r\n    or specific intent to injure are exempted from the exclusive remedy of workersâ€™ \r\n    compensation coverage.â€).Â  There is no evidence in the record that anyone \r\n    affiliated with Milliken had any intention of harming Edens or any other individual.Â  \r\n    The Milliken employee who disconnected the safety mats did not do so with \r\n    the intent to injure anyone.Â  Rather, the mats were disabled because the repeated \r\n    stopping of the robotic shuttle â€œaggravatedâ€ the shuttle operator.Â  Further, \r\n    the fact that, after the mats were disconnected, workers on the floor were \r\n    warned whenever the shuttle passed nearby goes to prove a lack of intent by \r\n    any of the Milliken staff to cause injury.Â  In addition, the shuttle operator \r\n    did not have a deliberate or specific intent to harm Edens, as he testified \r\n    he was unaware Edens was in the dye vat area when the robotic shuttle was \r\n    sent to the vat.Â  We note the Estateâ€™s argument that it is entitled to apply \r\n    the intentional tort exception is, at best, disingenuous, where a negligence \r\n    cause of action was clearly pled in the amended complaint.\r\n  Moreover, in applying for and receiving \r\n    a Workersâ€™ Compensation recovery, the Estate admitted that Edensâ€™ death resulted \r\n    from an accident in the workplace.Â  The language of the Commissionâ€™s order \r\n    states: â€œIt appears that the deceased, Christopher J. Edens, . . . on or about \r\n    February 10, 1998 . . . sustained an injury by accident arising out \r\n    of and in the course of said employment which led to his death on that date.â€ \r\n    (emphasis added).\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Based on these undisputed \r\n    facts, the Circuit Court correctly determined the â€œintentional tort exception \r\n    had no applicationâ€ to the Estateâ€™s claims.Â  The affidavits filed by the Estate \r\n    did not address, much less contradict, the undisputed facts.Â  The Estate \r\n    did not submit any evidence suggesting that anyone intended to harm or injure \r\n    Edens or that an intentional tort occurred.Â  Concomitantly, the trial \r\n    judge did not err in concluding the Estateâ€™s action was barred by the Workersâ€™ \r\n    Compensation Act.

Carswell, \r\na resident of South Carolina and father of two children with Denisse T. Carswell, \r\nto pay child support in the amount of $478.00 per month and day care expenses \r\nof $278.00 per month.Â  This enforcement action was brought by DSS at the request \r\nof Denisse T. Carswell, a resident of Washington, and pursuant to the Uniform \r\nReciprocal Enforcement of Support Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-960 (1985).Â  \r\nRespondent Thomas S. Carswell (â€œCarswellâ€) answered and counterclaimed, seeking \r\na modification of the order because of a substantial reduction in wages and a \r\nchange in circumstance that obviated the motherâ€™s need for daycare expenses. \r\n\r\nDSS and Carswell consented to a reduction \r\n  in child support, which resulted in a September 18, 1991 family court order \r\n  requiring a child support payment of $41.20 per week and a supplemental payment \r\n  of $10.30 a week to satisfy the arrearages.Â  This order was further modified \r\n  by three South Carolina orders that either increased amounts of support or altered \r\n  the payment schedule from a weekly payment to a monthly payment.Â  No South Carolina \r\n  order ever explicitly nullified the Washington order.\r\nIn 2002, DSS filed a Notice of Filing \r\n  and Registration of Foreign Support Order, which sought to register the Washington \r\n  order for enforcement, collect arrearages in the amount of $45,333.02, and institute \r\n  wage withholding.Â  Significantly, this action did not arise because Carswellâ€™s \r\n  support obligation was in arrears, but because DSS contends that it has the \r\n  right to seek enforcement of the original Washington order.Â  In fact, Carswell \r\n  had made advance payments.Â  Carswell filed a motion to dismiss.Â  The family \r\n  court found only one support order continued to exist, the modifying order issued \r\n  by the South Carolina court.Â  The court ruled:\r\n\r\n  That there exists only one support \r\n    order, the modified order of support issued on September 18th, \r\n    1991 by this Court.\r\n  While this Court continued to have \r\n    jurisdiction to modify its order of support plaintiff sought a modification \r\n    of the September 18th, 1991 support order, and defendantâ€™s child \r\n    support was increased by this Courtâ€™s order dated October 7th, \r\n    1992.\r\n  The only order of child support \r\n    to be enforced by this Court is the Courtâ€™s order of October 7th, \r\n    1992.\r\n\r\nDSS argues the court erred in failing \r\n  to find there were two enforceable orders, the Washington and South Carolina \r\n  orders, and in not applying the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders \r\n  Act to the Washington order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, \r\n  the court of appeals has the authority to find the facts in accordance with \r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Davis v. Davis, 356 \r\n  S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103 (2003); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. \r\n  195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999). However, this broad scope \r\n  of review does not require this court to disregard the findings of the family \r\n  court.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003); \r\n  Wooten v. Wooten, 356 S.C. 473, 476, 589 S.E.2d 769, 770&nbsp; (Ct. App. \r\n  2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. The family court erred in failing to find there existed two \r\n  enforceable child support orders.\r\nAt the time of entry for both the Washington and initial South Carolina orders, \r\n  the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (&quot;URESA&quot;) governed \r\n  the enforcement of interstate support orders. While the Uniform Interstate Family \r\n  Support Act is a successor statutory framework, it did not become effective \r\n  until July 1, 1994, and URESA remains the applicable law for the enforcement \r\n  of rights, forfeitures, and liabilities as they stood under URESA. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't. of Soc. Servs. v. Hamlett, 330 S.C. 321, 324, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  888, 890 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n\r\nURESA was designed to improve and \r\n  extend enforcement of support obligations against obligors in other states.Â  \r\n  Baugh v. Baugh, 280 S.C. 59, 61, 309 S.E.2d 756, 757&nbsp;(1983).Â  URESA \r\n  allows an out-of-state support order to be registered in this State and then \r\n  enforced as a support order issued by this State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1150 \r\n  and 20-7-1155 (1985).Â  In 1991, Appellant brought an action pursuant to URESA \r\n  to enforce a Washington order that required Respondent to pay monthly child \r\n  support and contribute to daycare expenses.Â  An agreement was made between the \r\n  parties that Respondent would pay an amount less than the Washington order required, \r\n  and an order stating that the â€œParties Agreeâ€ was entered by the court codifying \r\n  this agreement.Â  This modification of the support order was allowed under URESA.Â  \r\n  See Balestrine v. Jordan, 275 S.C. 442, 443-44, 272 S.E.2d 438, \r\n  438-39 (1980).\r\nIn 2002, DSS sought to file and register \r\n  the Washington order so that it could enforce the support obligation, collect \r\n  arrearages, and institute wage withholding.Â  The family court dismissed the \r\n  case after finding only the South Carolina order was entitled to enforcement.Â  \r\n  This was error. \r\nImportantly, under the statutory \r\n  framework created by URESA, multiple support orders can exist.Â  Badeaux v. \r\n  Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 206, 522 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Section \r\n  20-7-1110 of URESA states:\r\n\r\n  A support order made by a court \r\n    of this State pursuant to this subarticle does not nullify and is not nullified \r\n    by a support order made by a court of this State pursuant to any other law \r\n    or by a support order made by a court of any other state pursuant to a substantially \r\n    similar act or any other law regardless of priority of issuance unless \r\n    otherwise specifically provided by the court.Â  Amounts paid for a particular \r\n    period pursuant to any support order made by the court of another state must \r\n    be credited against the amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under \r\n    any support order made by the court of this State.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added); see South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Hamlett, 330 S.C. 321, 326, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  888, 890-91 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing URESA); see also Roy T. Stuckey, \r\n  Marital Litigation in South Carolina 656-59 (3d ed., 2001) (discussing \r\n  URESA and specifically the required compliance with the antinullification clause). \r\n  \r\nThe issue before this court is whether \r\n  any of the South Carolina orders nullified the Washington order.Â  A careful \r\n  examination of the initial order, as well as the three subsequent South Carolina \r\n  orders, fails to reveal any clear intent to nullify the Washington order.Â  The \r\n  only recognition of a Washington order occurs on the initial South Carolina \r\n  order.Â  On this order are the words â€œURESAâ€”Washington (State),â€ apparently modifying \r\n  the preprinted title, â€œSupport Order.â€Â  While this language acknowledges that \r\n  the Order concerns an out-of-state support obligation governed by URESA, it \r\n  does not rise to the level of a nullification of the Washington order.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the Washington order remains extant and enforceable. \r\n \r\nII. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act requires that \r\n  the Washington order be recognized.\r\n \r\nAn additional legislative response to the need for a uniform and less complex \r\n  system of interstate child support enforcement actions is the federal Full Faith \r\n  and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (&quot;FFCCSOA&quot;), which has, as \r\n  one of its purposes, the desire &quot;to avoid jurisdictional competition and \r\n  conflict among State courts in the establishment of child support orders.&quot; \r\n  Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, Pub. L. No. 103-383, &sect; \r\n  2(c)(3), 108 Stat. 4064 (1994) (codified as Historical and Statutory Notes at \r\n  28 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1738B (West 2003)). The FFCCSOA achieves this goal by creating \r\n  a system where some court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over any support \r\n  order. 28 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1738B(d) (West 2003). Prior to ascertaining if Washington \r\n  had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, we must determine the efficacy of the \r\n  FFCCSOA to this case. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Washington order was dated in 1990 and the South Carolina order was issued \r\n  in 1991.Â  Both of these orders came prior to the 1994 effective date of the \r\n  FFCCSOA.Â  Therefore, we must decide if the FFCCSOA can be applied retroactively.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe FFCCSOA does not expressly provide for retroactive application.Â  North \r\n  Carolina and Georgia have determined the Act can and should be applied retroactively.Â  \r\n  Georgia Depâ€™t of Human Res. v.

Ct. 1995). \r\nThese courts first noted the language and purpose of both the Act and the legislative \r\nhistory is of a remedial nature, which suggests a retroactive application to assist \r\nin the collection of past arrearages.Â  Deason, 520 S.E.2d at 719; Twaddell, \r\n523 S.E.2d at 717.Â  Under South Carolina law, statutes that are remedial or procedural \r\nin nature are generally held to operate retrospectively. See South Carolina \r\nDepâ€™t of Revenue v. Rosemary Coin Mach., Inc.,&nbsp;339 S.C. 25, 28, 528 S.E.2d \r\n416, 418&nbsp; (2000); Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury \r\nFund, 277 S.C. 604, 607, 291 S.E.2d 667, 669 (1982); Hercules, Inc. v. \r\nSouth Carolina Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137, 143, 262 S.E.2d 45, 48 (1980) (noting \r\nstatutes affecting the remedy, not the right, are generally retrospective).Â  Therefore, \r\nthe provisions of the FFCCSOA should be applied retroactively. \r\nIn addition \r\nto looking at whether the statute is remedial in nature, the United States Supreme \r\nCourt has enunciated a test to determine if an injustice would occur as a result \r\nof the retroactive application of a law.Â  The three factors to consider are: the \r\nnature and identity of the parties, the nature of their rights, and the nature \r\nof the impact of the change in law upon those rights.Â  Bradley v. Sch. Bd. \r\nof City of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 717, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2019, 40 L.Ed.2d 476, \r\n491-92 (1974). \r\nIn the case at bar, the FFCCSOA does not impose a new obligation \r\nbecause a parentâ€™s support obligation arises at the birth of a child.Â  See \r\ngenerally Lunsford v. Lunsford, 277 S.C. 104, 104, 282 S.E.2d 861, \r\n862 (1981) (finding a parent has a legal obligation to support a minor child); \r\nCampbell v. Campbell, 200 S.C. 67, 72, 20 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1942) (recognizing \r\nit is nothing less than a â€œprinciple of natureâ€ that a parent has an obligation \r\nto maintain and support his child).Â  The statute deals with matters of great congressional \r\nconcern, i.e., the need to enforce interstate child support orders.Â  Deason, \r\n520 S.E.2d at 720; Twaddell, 523 S.E.2d at 717.Â  Finally, the obligor is \r\nnot deprived of a right that has matured or become unconditional because the preexisting \r\nobligation remains the same.Â  Id.Â  Thus, under Bradley, the obligor \r\nsuffers no injustice by the retroactive application of the FFCCSOA.Â  Id.Â   \r\n \r\nBecause we have established the FFCCSOA can be applied retroactively, we must \r\ndiscern the impact of the FFCCSOA on this case.Â  The FFCCSOA settles the interrelationship \r\nbetween various support orders by creating a system where there is one court with \r\ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction.Â  Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in \r\nSouth Carolina 653-55 (3d ed., 2001).Â  The FFCCSOA states:Â  â€œA court of a \r\nState that has made a child support order consistently with this section has continuing, \r\nexclusive jurisdiction over the order if the State is the childâ€™s State or the \r\nresidence of any individual contestant unless the court of another State, acting \r\nin accordance with subsections (e) and (f), has made a modification of the order.â€Â  \r\n28 USCA Â§ 1738B(d) (West 2003).Â  Washington is the home of the child and has continuing, \r\nexclusive jurisdiction, unless the South Carolina order was a modification pursuant \r\nto the FFCCSOA.Â   \r\nIn order to modify an existing order, \r\n  the FFCCSOA requires:Â  \r\n\r\n  A court of a State may modify a \r\n    child support order issued by a court of another State ifâ€”(1) the court has \r\n    jurisdiction to make such a child support order pursuant to subsection (i) \r\n    [requiring no party reside in the issuing state and the order is registered \r\n    in the State with jurisdiction over the nonmovant party]; and (2) (A) the \r\n    court of the other State no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction \r\n    of the child support order because that State no longer is the childâ€™s State \r\n    or the residence of any individual contestant; or (B) each individual contestant \r\n    has filed written consent with the State of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction \r\n    for a court of another State to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive \r\n    jurisdiction over the order.\r\n\r\n28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1738B(e) (West 2003); \r\n  cf. Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 214, 522 S.E.2d 835, 845 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999) (applying the FFCCSOA and finding no modification to an out-of-state \r\n  order filed pursuant to UIFSA).\r\nThe order was not modified under \r\n  subsections (1) or (2)(A) because mother and child resided in Washington at \r\n  the time of the hearing.Â  Subsection (2)(B) does not apply because there is \r\n  no evidence in the record that the contestants have filed written consent with \r\n  Washington for South Carolina to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction.Â  See Badeaux, 337 S.C. at 214, 522 S.E.2d at 845.Â  \r\n  The FFCCSOA dictates that Washington has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  and that the Washington order be accorded full faith and credit by South Carolina. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3817","title":"Wimberly v.

Wimberly \r\n  brought this action against Wayne Barr; Steve Rutland and Roy Rutland, doing \r\n  business as South Willow Logging and Roy Rutland Logging; and Southeastern Forest \r\n  Products, Inc., for cutting timber on his property without permission.Â  The \r\n  jury awarded actual and punitive damages.Â  After post-trial motions, the trial \r\n  judge decreased the amount of actual damages to equal three times the value \r\n  of the timber pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-615 (2003) [1]  (the timber statute).Â  The punitive damages were not altered.Â  \r\n  Wimberly appeals the reduction of the actual damages.Â  The Rutlands and the \r\n  logging companies (collectively referred to as Respondents) appeal the failure \r\n  to reduce the punitive damages. [2] Â  We affirm in part and reverse \r\n  in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nWimberly owns 157 acres of wooded \r\n  property in Orangeburg County which he leases for hunting.Â  Â Barr is an adjoining \r\n  landowner.Â Â  In 1999, Barr sold the harvestable timber on thirty-five acres \r\n  of his property to Southeastern.Â  Southeastern contracted with the Rutlands \r\n  to perform the logging.Â  \r\nThere was some confusion over the \r\n  exact location of the dividing line between the properties.Â  Although there \r\n  was a cleared roadway and flags on Wimberlyâ€™s property, neither the road nor \r\n  the flags delineated the property line with Barr.Â  Wimberly was concerned that \r\n  the loggers would cut timber from his property.Â  On at least three occasions, \r\n  either Wimberly or his lessees informed Barr of the location of the property \r\n  line.Â Â  \r\nBarr testified that he told Mike \r\n  Grooms, the owner of Southeastern, and Roy Rutland that they were not to cut \r\n  up to the flagged tract of land.Â  The loggers cut right up to the flagged area, \r\n  which resulted in the removal of timber from approximately 4.89 acres of Wimberlyâ€™s \r\n  property. \r\nWimberly brought this action against \r\n  Respondents, alleging damages under theories of trespass, negligence, unfair \r\n  trade practices, conversion, and violation of the criminal statute against removing \r\n  timber without permission, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-580 (2003). [3] Â Â  Wimberly informed the court before trial that he was not \r\n  going forward on the claim under that statute.Â Â  \r\nWimberly presented several expert \r\n  witnesses to establish his damages totaling approximately $39,000.Â  Charles \r\n  Hills, a registered forester, testified that the timber cut from Wimberlyâ€™s \r\n  property had a fair market value of $4,163.63.Â  Hills also estimated that it \r\n  would cost $1,841 to prepare and replant Wimberlyâ€™s land.Â  Rudy Matthews, an \r\n  outdoorsman, testified regarding the reduced value of the lease for recreational \r\n  use of the property.Â Â Â  Matthews testified that because the timber on Wimberlyâ€™s \r\n  property had been reduced, the property could accommodate fewer hunters.Â  Mathews \r\n  estimated that had the timber not been harvested, Wimberly could have accommodated \r\n  nine to ten hunters at $400 per year each.Â Â  The loss of lease value was estimated \r\n  at $22,500.Â Â  Rogers Cobb, a real property appraiser, opined the property was \r\n  worth $113,000 prior to the harvesting of the timber and approximately $10,958 \r\n  less after the harvesting.Â  \r\nRespondents moved for a directed \r\n  verdict, arguing, in part, that Wimberlyâ€™s damages should be limited to three \r\n  times the value of the timber cut pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-615 (2003) \r\n  (providing that when a landowner institutes a civil action for the wrongful \r\n  harvesting of timber, his damages for the loss of his timber shall not exceed \r\n  three times the fair market value of the timber). Â The trial court denied the \r\n  motion to limit Wimberlyâ€™s claim to three times the value of the timber and \r\n  granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for directed verdict on the claim of unfair trade \r\n  practices.Â  Wimberly consented to go forward only on the trespass claim.Â Â  The \r\n  jury was charged only on the law of trespass and was instructed to determine \r\n  whether actual or punitive damages were proper.Â Â  Neither party requested the \r\n  timber statute be charged to the jury, and the statute was not charged.Â  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of Wimberly in the amount of $33,300.00 in actual damages and $30,000.00 in \r\n  punitive damages.Â Â  Respondents moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  (JNOV) to reduce the amount of actual damages pursuant to section 16-11-615 \r\n  to exactly three times the value of the timber cut.Â  Additionally, they moved \r\n  for JNOV as to both the actual and punitive damages alleging neither had been \r\n  proven.Â  In the alternative, they moved for a new trial absolute.Â Â  \r\nThe trial court found the timber \r\n  statute was the exclusive remedy for Wimberlyâ€™s actual damages and reduced the \r\n  actual damages award to $12,490.92, which was three times the value of the cut \r\n  timber testified to by Wimberlyâ€™s witness at trial.Â  The court denied the remaining \r\n  motions, thereby letting stand the $30,000.00 in punitive damages.Â Â Â  \r\nWimberly appeals the grant of the \r\n  JNOV as to the actual damages and Respondents appeal the trial courtâ€™s failure \r\n  to grant a JNOV as to punitive damages.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough the parties appeal the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision on a motion for a JNOV, the trial courtâ€™s decision was based \r\n  upon the courtâ€™s interpretation of a statute.Â  The issue of interpretation of \r\n  a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; \r\n  Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995) \r\n  (holding the determination of legislative intent is a matter of law).Â  Further, \r\n  whether the timber statute creates an exclusive remedy is a novel question of \r\n  law.Â  Appellate courts are free to decide novel questions of law â€œwith no particular \r\n  deference to the lower court.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWimberly argues the trial court erred \r\n  in finding the timber statute is an exclusive remedy.Â  He argues that proceeding \r\n  under the timber statute is merely one remedy available, and because he proceeded \r\n  under a trespass cause of action, he could recover all actual and punitive damages.Â  \r\n  Respondents contend section 16-11-615 is the exclusive remedy by which Wimberly \r\n  can recover damages caused by the removal of timber from his property.Â  Respondents \r\n  argue that because the statute is the exclusive remedy, the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to grant their motion for a JNOV as to punitive damages. [4] \r\nA.\r\nThe main issue in this appeal is \r\n  whether the timber statute sets forth the exclusive remedy for recovering damages \r\n  associated with the improper removal of timber or whether a landowner is able \r\n  to bring additional causes of action.Â  We find the statute does not create the \r\n  exclusive remedy for all damages associated with the removal of timber.Â  \r\nSection 16-11-615 reads:\r\n\r\n  In all criminal prosecutions for \r\n    violation of the provisions of Â§Â§ 16-11-520, 16-11-580, and 16-11-10, relating \r\n    to cutting or destroying timber, the defendant may plead the payment of not \r\n    to exceed exactly three times the fair market value of the timber as determined \r\n    by a registered forester and upon the plea being legally established and the \r\n    payment of all costs accrued at the time of the plea he must be discharged \r\n    from further penalty.Â  If it is necessary to institute civil action to recover \r\n    the fair market value of the timber, the State, in case of state lands, and \r\n    the owner, in case of private lands, shall receive damages of not to exceed \r\n    exactly three times the fair market value of the timber established by a registered \r\n    forester if judgment is in favor of the State or the owner.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-615 (2003).\r\n â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory \r\n  construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  \r\n  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, \r\n  207 (2003).Â  â€œWhere the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply \r\n  those terms according to their literal meaning.â€Â  Paschal v. State Election \r\n  Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995).Â Â  \r\nSection 16-11-615 has only been discussed \r\n  in one prior case.Â  In Stroud v. Elliott, 316 S.C. 242, 449 S.E.2d 261 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994), this Court determined the actual damages awarded by the jury \r\n  for the improper removal of timber were not supported by the evidence and were \r\n  excessive.Â  While the amount was less than three times the fair market value \r\n  of the timber, this Court refused to affirm on the additional sustaining ground \r\n  that section 16-11-615 provides for recovery not to exceed three times the fair \r\n  market value.Â  The case proceeded under causes of action for trespass and to \r\n  quiet title, not under the timber statute, and this Court noted the statute \r\n  was never charged to the jury.Â  Stroud, 316 S.C. at 244 n.1, 449 S.E.2d \r\n  at 262 n.1 (â€œSection 16-11-615 provides that where an owner of private land \r\n  brings an action to recover the fair market value of timber, the owner â€˜shall \r\n  receive damages of not to exceed exactly three times the fair market value of \r\n  the timber.â€™Â  The trial court, however, did not charge this code section to \r\n  the jury.â€).Â  The issue of whether the statute provided the exclusive remedy \r\n  for damages associated with the wrongful harvesting of timber was not addressed \r\n  in Stroud.\r\nWe must look to the language of the \r\n  statute itself for guidance.Â  The statute is found within a section of the code \r\n  addressing criminal trespass and the unlawful use of property.Â  It allows a \r\n  criminal defendant to be discharged from further penalties under a plea if the \r\n  defendant pays the harmed landowner an amount of damages not to exceed three \r\n  times the value of the cut timber.Â  The statute also provides that a landowner \r\n  can institute a civil action to recover up to three times the value of the cut \r\n  timber.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-615 (2003).\r\nAlthough the timber statute provides \r\n  that a landowner may institute a civil action to recover up to three times the \r\n  fair market value of the timber cut, a clear reading of the statute does not \r\n  prohibit a landowner from recovering other types of damages.Â  Nothing in the \r\n  statute provides that it is the exclusive remedy for all kinds of damages.Â  \r\n  The plain language of the statute clearly limits the damages only in a â€œcivil \r\n  action to recover the fair market value of the timber . . . â€ under the statute.Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nThe action in the current case involved \r\n  more than merely the recovery of the fair market value of the timber.Â  Proceeding \r\n  under a cause of action for trespass, Wimberly provided evidence of damage to \r\n  the value of the hunting lease and damage to the fair market value of the property \r\n  as a whole, in addition to the loss of the fair market value of the timber.Â  \r\n  While his recovery of damages for the timber may be limited to three times the \r\n  fair market value of the timber removed, the statute does not express an intent \r\n  by the Legislature that all damages resulting from that removal be capped at \r\n  three times the fair market value.Â  \r\nRespondents argue, however, that \r\n  the Legislature clearly intended the timber statute to be a cap on all types \r\n  of damages emanating from the wrongful harvesting of timber.Â  Respondents cite \r\n  to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act [5]  as an example of a statute wherein \r\n  the Legislature created an exclusive remedy and a cap on damages.Â  With certain \r\n  specified exceptions, the Tort Claims Act provides the â€œexclusive civil \r\n  remedy available for any tort committed by a governmental entity, its \r\n  employees, or its agents except as provided in Â§ 15-78-70(b).â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-20(b) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  With some exceptions, the Tort \r\n  Claims Act limits the amount of damages recoverable for any claim to $300,000.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  As the statute specifically \r\n  notes that it is the exclusive remedy for any tort committed by a governmental \r\n  employee, Respondents are correct that the Legislature intended to create an \r\n  exclusive remedy under the Tort Claims Act, and the exclusive remedy contains \r\n  a cap on recovery.Â  However, the language of section 16-11-615 does not contain \r\n  similar exclusivity language.Â  Accordingly, Respondentsâ€™ argument is without \r\n  merit.Â  \r\nFurther, Wimberly specifically waived \r\n  his action under the timber statute before the trial began and proceeded only \r\n  on a claim for trespass.Â  As in Stroud, the timber statute was not charged \r\n  to the jury.Â  Because we find the Legislature did not express an intent to make \r\n  the timber statute the exclusive remedy to recover all types of damages associated \r\n  with the loss of timber, we also find that we cannot bind a party to restrictions \r\n  found therein if the case did not proceed under the statute.Â  \r\nTo restrict Wimberlyâ€™s recovery to \r\n  $12,490.92, when there is evidence in the record of damages in excess of the \r\n  $33,000.00 in actual damages found by the jury, would supplant the existing \r\n  common-law right to recover for all damages associated with anotherâ€™s wrongdoing.Â  \r\n  â€œThe Legislature is presumed to enact legislation with reference to existing \r\n  law, and there is a strong presumption that it does not intend by statute to \r\n  change common-law rules.â€Â  Hoogenboom v. City of Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, \r\n  318 n. 5, 433 S.E.2d 875, 884 n. 5 (Ct. App. 1992) (citing Columbia Real \r\n  Estate &amp; Trust Co. v. Royal Exch. Assurance, 132 S.C. 427, 128 S.E. \r\n  865 (1925)).Â  â€œA statute is not to be construed as in derogation of common-law \r\n  rights if another interpretation is reasonable.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe find the Legislature did not intend \r\n  to eliminate the common law right to collect all damages associated with a wrong.Â  \r\n  Instead, the Legislature intended to set forth a means for a landowner to recover \r\n  the fair market value of timber wrongfully harvested in violation of the criminal \r\n  statute.Â  The plain language of the statute does not prohibit the landowner \r\n  from also recovering for the other damages that naturally flow from the wrongful \r\n  harvesting of timber.Â  As such, we find the trial court erred as a matter of \r\n  law in reducing the amount of actual damages to exactly three times the value \r\n  of the timber pursuant to section 16-11-615.Â  As the claim proceeded to the \r\n  jury on a cause of action for trespass, the jury properly awarded actual damages \r\n  to reflect all damages causally related to the trespass onto Wimberlyâ€™s property.Â  \r\n  \r\nB.\r\nAdditionally, we find the trial court \r\n  properly denied Respondentsâ€™ motion for JNOV as to the punitive damages.Â  \r\nPunitive damages may be awarded for \r\n  trespass â€œwhen a defendantâ€™s acts have been willful, wanton or in reckless disregard \r\n  of the rights of another.â€Â  Fox v. Munnerlyn, 283 S.C. 490, 493, 323 \r\n  S.E.2d 68, 69 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œThe purposes of punitive damages are to punish \r\n  the wrongdoer and deter the wrongdoer and others from engaging in similar reckless, \r\n  willful, wanton, or malicious conduct in the future.â€Â  Clark v. Cantrell, \r\n  339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000).Â  Trial courts should conduct \r\n  a post-trial review of punitive damages to determine whether the award of punitive \r\n  damages was proper.Â  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-12, 406 S.E.2d \r\n  350, 354 (1991) (â€œHereafter, to ensure that a punitive damage award is proper, \r\n  the trial court shall conduct a post-trial review and may consider the following:Â  \r\n  (1) defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendantâ€™s \r\n  awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood \r\n  the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether \r\n  the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; \r\n  (7) defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and finally, (8) . . . â€˜other factorsâ€™ deemed \r\n  appropriate.â€).Â  â€œThe trial judge has considerable discretion regarding the \r\n  amount of damages both actual or punitive awarded.â€Â  Kuznik v.

App. 2000), cert. dismissed, \r\n  (Jan. 7, 2004).\r\nIn denying the Respondentsâ€™ motion \r\n  for JNOV as to the punitive damages, the trial court considered the evidence \r\n  presented at trial and the Gamble factors.Â  Evidence at trial indicated \r\n  that Wimberly or hunters leasing his property informed Barr several times regarding \r\n  the location of the property line.Â Â  Wimberly requested that Barr obtain a survey \r\n  to insure his property would not be harmed, but Barr did not want to incur the \r\n  expense.Â  Barr informed the loggers that they should not clear the land near \r\n  the road or flags.Â  When informed that the loggers were clearing land where \r\n  they were instructed not to, Barrâ€™s wife arrived at the site and informed the \r\n  loggers to cease logging on Wimberlyâ€™s property.Â  The loggers ignored Mrs. Barrâ€™s \r\n  instructions and continued to harvest timber from Wimberlyâ€™s property. \r\nWe find there was evidence that Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  actions were willful, intentional, and in disregard of Wimberlyâ€™s rights.Â  Thus, \r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Respondentsâ€™ motion \r\n  for JNOV as to punitive damages.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause section 16-11-615 does not \r\n  provide a cap on all damages emanating from the wrongful harvesting of timber, \r\n  the trial court erred in reducing the amount of the actual damages award to \r\n  three times the fair market value of the timber wrongfully harvested.Â  The juryâ€™s \r\n  original actual damages award shall be reinstated.Â  The trial court did not \r\n  err in affirming the juryâ€™s award of punitive damages.Â  Accordingly, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED \r\n  IN PART.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  This statute has not been modified since its enactment in 1985.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, we cite to the current codification of the statute.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Wayne Barr failed to file a Final Appellantâ€™s Brief of Respondent/Appellant.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, we will not consider his issues on appeal.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Section 16-11-580 provides that it is â€œunlawful \r\n    for anyone to knowingly or wilfully cut, destroy or remove any trees or timber \r\n    of any kind . . . without the consent of the owner. . . .â€Â  S.C.

Hawkins in contempt of court for various violations of previous \r\n  court orders relating to visitation with the partiesâ€™ minor child.Â  We reverse \r\n  and remand for the consideration of sanctions, if appropriate.\r\n&nbsp; \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1998, Mullins, a resident \r\n  of Virginia, brought an action against Hawkins, then a resident of North Carolina, \r\n  seeking visitation with the partiesâ€™ minor child.Â  In May 1999, the North Carolina \r\n  District Court issued an order awarding Mullins visitation.Â  \r\nIn August 1999, the North Carolina District Court \r\n  held Hawkins in contempt for leaving the state of North Carolina and withholding \r\n  the minor childâ€™s address from Mullins in violation of the courtâ€™s order.Â  The \r\n  court also ordered that Hawkinsâ€™ brother-in-law, Jim Jackson, not be present \r\n  for pick-up or drop-off of the minor child or in any way interfere with Mullinsâ€™ \r\n  visitation with the minor child.Â  In March 2000, the North Carolina District \r\n  Court transferred the case to South Carolina. \r\nIn December 2000, the family court in Aiken County \r\n  convened a hearing pursuant to Mullinsâ€™ Order and Rule to Show Cause, which \r\n  again alleged Hawkinsâ€™ noncompliance with court-ordered visitation.Â  Prior to \r\n  the hearing, the parties reached a final agreement, which granted Mullins monthly \r\n  visitation, Christmas visitation, and extensive summer visitation.Â  \r\nIn April 2001, alleging the \r\n  prior visitation agreement was not in the best interest of the child, Hawkins \r\n  sought and received an ex parte order suspending visitation between Mullins \r\n  and the partiesâ€™ child.Â  After a May 8, 2001 hearing, the court issued an order \r\n  lifting the ex parte order, changing the location of the visitation exchange, \r\n  granting make-up visitation to Mullins, and reinstating summer visitation.Â  \r\n\r\nIn January 2002, Hawkins contacted Mullins, requesting \r\n  that his monthly visitation be rescheduled because of their childâ€™s temporary \r\n  illness.Â  Mullins agreed to reschedule, but according to Mullins, when the time \r\n  came to make up the visit, Hawkins denied that an agreement ever occurred.Â  \r\n  From February 2002 until July 2002, Mullins continued to exercise monthly visitation \r\n  pursuant to the courtâ€™s orders.Â  In July 2002, Hawkins refused to participate \r\n  in summer visitation, taking the position that the previous family court order \r\n  granting summer visitation was incorrectly written, and therefore, â€œno good.â€Â  \r\n  Instead, Hawkins offered to shorten visitation to two weeks in the summer when \r\n  visitation did not conflict with her plans for the child.\r\nIn July 2002, Mullins filed \r\n  an Order and Rule To Show Cause seeking to have Hawkins found in contempt of \r\n  court for denial of summer 2002 visitation, for denial of weekend visitation \r\n  for January 2002, for allowing a prohibited third party to be present during \r\n  a visitation exchange in July 2001, and to show cause as to why a restraining \r\n  order should not be issued restraining and enjoining Hawkins or any of her agents \r\n  from telephone harassment during summer visitation.Â  \r\nThe court declined to hold Hawkins in contempt \r\n  for refusing to participate in summer visitation in 2002.Â  The court also detailed \r\n  the frequency with which the partiesâ€™ child could be called while in the possession \r\n  of the other party, which included a provision limiting phone calls from the \r\n  childâ€™s maternal grandparents.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.\r\n        \r\n  Did the trial court err in failing to find Hawkins in contempt \r\n  because of Hawkinsâ€™ willful failure to produce minor child for visitation in \r\n  January 2002 and July 2002?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.\r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  and costs stemming from Hawkinsâ€™ contempt?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ On appeal from the family court, \r\n  this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt \r\n  is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary \r\n  support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Henderson v. Puckett, \r\n  316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the \r\n  order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€Â  Townsend \r\n  v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nContempt\r\nMullins contends that the \r\n  trial court erred in failing to find Hawkins in contempt for failing to produce \r\n  their child for visitation during January 2002 and for failing to produce their \r\n  child for summer visitation in 2002.Â  \r\nA party may be found in contempt of court for the \r\n  willful violation of a lawful court order.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  Before a party may be found in contempt, the record must clearly and \r\n  specifically show the contemptuous conduct.Â  State v. Bevilacqua, 316 \r\n  S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In a proceeding for contempt \r\n  for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of \r\n  a court order and the facts establishing the respondent's noncompliance with \r\n  the order.Â  Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 42, 545 S.E.2d 830, 832 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  At the same time, we remain cognizant that â€œcontempt is an extreme \r\n  measure and the power to adjudge a person in contempt is not to be lightly asserted.â€Â  \r\n  Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. at 128, 447 S.E.2d at 216.Â Â  On appeal, the appellate \r\n  court may reverse a trial judgeâ€™s determination regarding contempt only if it \r\n  is without evidentiary support or is an abuse of discretion.Â  Haselden v. \r\n  Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 63-64, 552 S.E.2d 329, 337 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nMullins asserts Hawkins should have been held in \r\n  contempt for failing to produce the child for visitation in January 2002.Â  Although \r\n  Mullins raised the issue in his Order and Rule to Show Cause, there is no indication \r\n  in the record the trial court ruled on whether Hawkinsâ€™ was in contempt for \r\n  denial of January visitation.Â  Furthermore, Mullins failed to raise this matter \r\n  in a post-trial motion. Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appeal. See \r\n  I'On v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (stating \r\n  parties should raise all necessary issues and arguments to trial court and attempt \r\n  to obtain a ruling); Townsend v. City of Dillon, 326 S.C. 244, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  95 (1997) (holding issues not ruled upon by the trial judge are not preserved \r\n  for appellate review); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 \r\n  (1991) (ruling issue was not preserved for appellate review where the trial \r\n  court did not explicitly rule on the appellant's argument and the appellant \r\n  made no Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment). \r\nMullins next contends that \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to find Hawkins in contempt for failing to \r\n  produce their child for summer visitation in 2002.Â  We agree.\r\nIn November 2000, Hawkins \r\n  and Mullins agreed to a visitation schedule that was incorporated into the courtâ€™s \r\n  final order. Mullins was granted month-long summer visitation during July.Â  \r\n  Hawkins filed a SCRCP 59(e) Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment and, in April \r\n  2001, Hawkins filed a petition for an ex parte restraining order to suspend \r\n  visitation.Â  Mullins filed an Order and Rule to Show Cause on the visitation \r\n  issue.Â  The ex parte restraining order was granted prior to a hearing on the \r\n  59(e) motion and the Rule to Show Cause.\r\nOn June 12, 2001, the court \r\n  issued an order addressing the issues raised in the partiesâ€™ pending filings.Â  \r\n  The court lifted the ex parte order, granted make-up visitation to Mullins, \r\n  specified the dates for summer visitation in 2001 and modified monthly visitation \r\n  and location for exchange.Â  The court ordered the remaining provisions of the \r\n  December order to remain in full force and effect.\r\nHawkins asserts the June 2001 order only references \r\n  summer visitation for the year 2001 and makes no reference to future summer \r\n  visitation.Â  Because no summer visitation was ordered beyond 2001, Hawkins maintains \r\n  she made good faith attempts to settle the issue of summer visitation.Â  After \r\n  denying Mullinsâ€™ the month-long July summer visitation, Hawkins sent a letter \r\n  reducing summer visitation to approximately two weeks, at times convenient to \r\n  her.Â  \r\nWe are not convinced Hawkins believed the January \r\n  9, 2001 order was â€œno goodâ€. We are equally not satisfied that Hawkins made \r\n  a good faith effort to reconcile the two orders so Mullins could receive the \r\n  month-long ordered visitation.Â  Hawkins specifically agreed to the month long \r\n  summer visitation in the final order from December 2000.Â  Moreover, the June \r\n  2001 order required that the month long summer visitation remain in effect.Â  \r\n  Hawkinsâ€™ protestations to the contrary are disingenuous. Hawkins had a history \r\n  of interfering with Mullinsâ€™ visitation and violating court orders.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find that Hawkins should be held in contempt because of her willful noncompliance \r\n  with the family courtâ€™s January 2001 order.\r\nSanction &amp; Fees For Contempt as to Visitation Exchange\r\nThe court found Hawkins in contempt for violating the \r\n  Courtâ€™s prior Order requiring that her brother-in-law, Mr. Jim Jackson, not \r\n  be present at visitation exchanges, but declined to impose sanctions or award \r\n  Mullins attorney fees and costs.Â  Mullins asserts this was in error.Â  We disagree.\r\nEven though a party is found to have violated a \r\n  court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter \r\n  for the court's discretion.Â  Sutton v. Sutton, 291 S.C. 401, 409, 353 \r\n  S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Moreover, the decision to deny attorney fees \r\n  is largely discretionary with the trial court and its decision will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Smith v. Smith, 308 S.C. \r\n  492, 496-497, 419 S.E.2d 232, 234-235 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Given that Mr. Jackson \r\n  was not outside with the parties while Father was present for the visitation \r\n  exchange, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in determining \r\n  the infraction was not of such a magnitude as to warrant the imposition of sanctions \r\n  or the assignment of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Hawkins should be held in contempt for noncompliance \r\n  with a court order.Â  We remand this matter to the lower court for consideration \r\n  of sanctions and attorneyâ€™s fees if the court deems them appropriate.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3819","title":"Knight v.

Knight, Jr., and Fredrick \r\n  Zeigler (Appellants) appeal a ruling by the trial court at the close of evidence \r\n  allowing Jene Marie Waggoner (Respondent) to voluntarily withdraw counterclaims \r\n  for trespass and conversion upon a motion by Appellants for a directed verdict \r\n  on those claims.Â  Appellants contend that dismissing these counterclaims without \r\n  prejudice was an abuse of the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants own property located \r\n  at 813 Harden Street, Columbia, South Carolina, which adjoins Respondentâ€™s vacant \r\n  lot at the rear of Respondentâ€™s property.Â  Respondents erected a fence between \r\n  the properties prior to Appellants obtaining title to their land.Â  The fence \r\n  is approximately one foot from Appellantsâ€™ property line on Respondentâ€™s property \r\n  and encloses an area measuring one foot by sixty feet of Respondentâ€™s land. \r\n  Appellants encroached onto this strip of land in a manner and for a time period \r\n  they believed satisfied the requirements of adverse possession.Â  In 2000, they \r\n  brought this action for adverse possession.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn May 2001, Respondent moved to amend her answer \r\n  to assert counterclaims for trespass and conversion as well as request a jury \r\n  trial.Â  In February 2002, the trial court granted the motion over Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  objection.Â  On July 15 â€“ 17, 2002, the case was tried before a jury.Â  At trial, \r\n  Appellants moved for a directed verdict on Respondentâ€™s counterclaims because, \r\n  over the course of the trial, Respondent had not mentioned the counterclaims, \r\n  their elements, or presented any evidence of damages.Â  Respondent moved for \r\n  a dismissal of the claims without prejudice.Â  Over Appellantsâ€™ objections, the \r\n  judge treated the counterclaims as being withdrawn, and dismissed the claims \r\n  without prejudice.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOrdinarily, a plaintiff is entitled to \r\n  a voluntary dismissal without prejudice as a matter of right, unless there is \r\n  a showing of legal prejudice to the defendant.Â  See Moore v. Berkeley \r\n  County, 290 S.C. 43, 44, 348 S.E.2d 174, 175 (1986); Gulledge v. Young, \r\n  242 S.C. 287, 291, 130 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1963).Â  If no legal prejudice is shown, \r\n  the trial judge has no discretion with respect to granting a dismissal without \r\n  prejudice; but if prejudice to the other party is shown, the matter becomes \r\n  one of discretion for the trial judge.Â  Id., Ralston Purina Co. v. \r\n  Odell, 248 S.C. 37, 41-42, 148 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1966). The same rules regarding \r\n  voluntary dismissal of a plaintiffâ€™s claim apply to voluntary dismissal of a \r\n  defendantâ€™s counterclaim.Â  See Rule 41(c), SCRCP.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend that the trial \r\n  judge erred in granting, without prejudice, Respondentâ€™s motion for voluntary \r\n  dismissal of her counterclaim.Â  Appellants argue they have suffered legal prejudice \r\n  as the result of the trial courtâ€™s abuse of discretion.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to our standard of review, the \r\n  determination of this case hinges on Appellantsâ€™ showing at trial, or lack thereof, \r\n  of legal prejudice that would result from the granting of Respondentâ€™s motion.Â  \r\n  If no showing of legal prejudice is made before the trial judge, the judge must \r\n  grant a motion for voluntary dismissal.Â  Moore, 290 S.C. at 44, 348 S.E.2d \r\n  at 175.Â  The burden of this showing of legal prejudice lies solely on the party \r\n  seeking to defeat the motion.Â  See Prime Med. Corp. v. First Med. \r\n  Corp., 291 S.C. 296, 300, 353 S.E.2d 294, 297 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â &nbsp;\r\n As the parties opposing the motion for \r\n  a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, Appellants failed to carry their burden \r\n  of showing legal prejudice.Â  Appellants conceded that the issues relating to \r\n  Respondentâ€™s counterclaims and any ensuing damages were not addressed during \r\n  trial.Â  Appellants reasoned that the trial judge should have denied Respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion because Appellantsâ€™ claims had already been tried. \r\n  [1]  Â A showing by an opposing party that it has already been put \r\n  through the time and expense of a trial does not, standing alone, constitute \r\n  legal prejudice; nor does the mere possibility that the party may have to defend \r\n  another lawsuit at a later date.Â  Walker v. Jones, 269 S.C. 19, 21, 235 \r\n  S.E.2d 810, 810-11 (1977).Â  All other justifications for a finding of legal \r\n  prejudice are asserted by Appellants for the first time on appeal and, therefore, \r\n  are not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilson v. Builders Transport, \r\n  Inc., 330 S.C. 287, 294, 498 S.E.2d 674, 678 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding that \r\n  an argument not presented to the trial court on record is not preserved for \r\n  appellate review).Â \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, the grant or denial of \r\n  Respondentâ€™s motion for voluntary dismissal is largely rendered moot by the \r\n  fact that the alleged trespasses are of a continuing nature and appear to be \r\n  reasonably and practicably abatable. SeeÂ  Silvester v. Spring Valley \r\n  Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 287, 543 S.E.2d 563, 567 (Ct.

Â§ 1983 claim, the trial court \r\n  reformed the Â§ 1983 verdict in Respondentâ€™s favor.Â  Appellant appeals this ruling.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn July 31, 1998, a robbery occurred at \r\n  the First Federal Bank in Goose Creek, South Carolina.Â  Many law enforcement \r\n  agencies responded to the robbery, including the Goose Creek Police Department, \r\n  the Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Department, the Charleston County Sheriffâ€™s Department, \r\n  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\r\nAt or near the time law enforcement agencies \r\n  were reacting to the bank robbery, Respondent began walking down College Park \r\n  Road, located in close proximity to the bank.Â  Deputy Jerry Wright of the Berkeley \r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department pulled up behind Respondent and motioned him towards \r\n  his car.Â  Deputy Wright asked Respondent if he would accompany him for the purpose \r\n  of answering some inquiries, as Respondent matched the general description of \r\n  a robbery suspect who had been involved in a car chase with another Berkeley \r\n  County deputy.Â  Respondent agreed, and he was taken to the mobile command post \r\n  set up by the various law enforcement agencies involved in investigating the \r\n  robbery.Â  Respondent professed he was handcuffed prior to being transported \r\n  to the mobile command post and that he remained cuffed for the majority of his \r\n  time there.\r\nUpon arrival at the command post, Respondent \r\n  testified he was introduced to Sheriff Dewitt who asked him again if he would \r\n  agree to being queried.Â  Respondent agreed, and Sheriff Dewitt questioned Respondent \r\n  about the bank robbery and his automobile, a 1992 Honda Accord.Â  Respondent \r\n  averred that earlier in the day he loaned his car to two of his friends so that \r\n  they could use it to get air in their car tire. \r\nFollowing the questioning, Sheriff \r\n  Dewitt asked Appellant to stand up and make a full turn so witnesses from the \r\n  bank could see him and determine whether he was one of the people involved.Â  \r\n  Because none of the witnesses identified Respondent as one of the perpetrators, \r\n  Sheriff Dewitt removed the handcuffs from Respondent, thanked him for his cooperation, \r\n  and told him he was â€œfree to go.â€\r\nIn connection with his release \r\n  from custody, Sheriff Dewitt instructed Deputy Wright that Respondent was cleared \r\n  of involvement in the bank robbery and to return him to where he was found.Â  \r\n  Sheriff Dewitt further informed Deputy Wright that he was to protect Respondentâ€™s \r\n  identity from the various media organizations gathering at the command post.\r\nBefore Deputy Wright could carry \r\n  out these instructions, Captain Yvonne Turner of the Goose Creek Police Department \r\n  instructed Appellant to have Respondent transported to the Goose Creek Police \r\n  Station.Â  Captain Turner was the top-ranking official from the Goose Creek Police \r\n  Department at the command post.Â  Captain Turner ordered Respondentâ€™s \r\n  detention because she was told the FBI wanted to question him further.Â  In \r\n  compliance with this order, Appellant asked another Goose Creek police officer \r\n  to assist her in transporting Respondent to the police station.Â  According to \r\n  Appellantâ€™s testimony, the other officerâ€™s assistance was needed because she \r\n  was driving an unmarked patrol car and it was police department policy to transport \r\n  suspects in marked patrol cars if possible.Â  After placing handcuffs back on \r\n  Respondent, Appellant placed Respondent in the rear of the second officerâ€™s \r\n  car.\r\nBoth cars left the command post with Appellantâ€™s \r\n  vehicle in the lead position.Â  According to Respondent, when his car arrived \r\n  at the police station, Appellant â€œkept going.â€Â  Appellant professed she did \r\n  not see Respondent again after they left the command post.\r\nRespondent declared he arrived at the police \r\n  station at approximately 1:30 p.m.Â  He was taken out of the patrol car by \r\n  two policemen who led him through the station and into a small, windowless room, \r\n  designated as the â€œBreathalyzer room,â€ a room commonly used for testing persons \r\n  charged with driving under the influence.Â  Within a few minutes after being \r\n  placed in the room, an FBI agent questioned Respondent for about five minutes.Â  \r\n  He remained handcuffed and alone in this room for the next several hours.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAfter Appellant had been in this room for three \r\n  or four hours, Detective Merrithew entered.Â  Respondent asked the detective \r\n  to find out what was going to happen to him.Â  Detective Merrithew told Respondent \r\n  a Berkeley County deputy was coming to transport him and the two individuals \r\n  who borrowed his car earlier in the day.Â  When the Berkeley County deputy arrived, \r\n  however, he informed Detective Merrithew that he was not looking for Respondent \r\n  and Respondent should have been sent home.Â  \r\nDetective Merrithew told Respondent he would discern \r\n  what was occurring and about fifteen minutes later, he returned to the room, \r\n  apologized, and removed Respondentâ€™s handcuffs.Â  Detective Merrithew then gave \r\n  Respondent a ride home around 7:00 p.m.\r\nRespondent commenced this action averring violation \r\n  of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983, as well as a state law claim of \r\n  false imprisonment.Â Â  The common law false imprisonment and the Â§ 1983 action \r\n  were submitted to the jury.Â  The jury returned a defense verdict on the Â§ 1983 \r\n  claim.Â  The jury awarded Respondent $3000 actual damages and $3000 punitive \r\n  damages on the false imprisonment claim.\r\nAfter the verdicts had been returned and the jury \r\n  discharged, Respondent moved â€œto have the verdict conformed to grant [Respondent] \r\n  judgment on the Section 1983 action.â€Â  The motion was based on the fact that \r\n  the jury awarded punitive damages on the state law claim, and concomitantly, \r\n  all of the elements for recovery under Â§ 1983 had been satisfied.\r\nThe trial court granted Respondentâ€™s motion because \r\n  it found the elements for each cause of action were identical and the verdict \r\n  on the state law claim supported a finding for Respondent on both causes of \r\n  action.Â  Appellant filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did Respondent waive his right to raise alleged inconsistencies in the verdicts \r\n  by not objecting prior to the discharge of the jury?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court improperly weigh the evidence, thereby invading the province \r\n  of the jury, when it placed greater emphasis on one verdict over the other?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in reconciling the verdicts when Respondent failed to \r\n  move for a new trial?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;\r\n         Is Appellant \r\n  entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         V.\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in concluding the two verdicts were inconsistent and \r\n  could not be reconciled as returned by the jury?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI.Â  Waiver\r\nAppellant argues Respondent \r\n  waived his right to raise any alleged inconsistencies in the two verdicts because \r\n  Respondent did not object until after the jury was discharged.Â Â Â  \r\nThe rule that parties \r\n  seeking to reform a verdict must voice their objection before the jury is discharged \r\n  has been followed in South Carolina since at least 1920.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Rhame v. City of Sumter, 113 S.C. 151, 154, 101 S.E. 832, 833 (1920), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by Rourk v. Selvey, 252 S.C. 25, 164 \r\n  S.E.2d 909 (1968) (â€œThe defendantâ€™s counsel made no attempt to find out what \r\n  the jury intended, and their objections come too late.Â  It was [counselâ€™s] business \r\n  to clarify and ask for a correction and reformation of the verdict before the \r\n  jury were [sic] discharged.â€). \r\nIn Dykema v. Carolina \r\n  Emergency Physicians, P.C., 348 S.C. 549, 560 S.E.2d 894 (2002), our supreme \r\n  court reaffirmed this principle.Â  In Dykema, a wrongful death action \r\n  against a hospital and medical provider, the jury awarded plaintiff $2,000,000 \r\n  in actual damages against the hospital and $500,000 in damages against the medical \r\n  provider.Â  Id. at 552, 560 S.E.2d at 895.Â  The trial court granted the \r\n  medical providerâ€™s request for JNOV, reasoning that the failure of the jury \r\n  to award actual damages precluded it from awarding punitive damages.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nIn finding the trial \r\n  court erred in granting the medical providerâ€™s motion for JNOV, the supreme \r\n  court noted, â€œ[t]his court has repeatedly held that a party should not be permitted \r\n  to sit idly by while a verdict erroneous in form is being returned and witness \r\n  its receipt without objection and later, after the jury has been discharged, \r\n  claim advantage of the error, thus invited by acquiescence.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  554, 560 S.E.2d at 896 (citations omitted).\r\nWe find the trial court erred in \r\n  entertaining Respondentâ€™s post-trial motion, as the motion was not presented \r\n  to the court prior to the jury being discharged.\r\nII.Â  Improper Weighing \r\n  of Evidence\r\nAppellant alleges that \r\n  by favoring one verdict over the other, the trial court improperly weighed the \r\n  evidence and thereby invaded the province of the jury.Â  Specifically, Appellant \r\n  asserts the trial court erred â€œin concluding that the intent of the jury could \r\n  be ascertained from the verdict in favor of the Respondent on the state law \r\n  claim.Â  It is just as possible that the juryâ€™s actual intent was consistent \r\n  with the defense verdict on the federal constitutional claim.â€Â  We agree.\r\nIn Vinson v. Hartley, \r\n  324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1996), this court examined when it would \r\n  be appropriate for a trial court to reform a jury verdict:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nA trial court may amend a verdict in matters of form, but \r\n  not of substance.Â  A change of substance is a change affecting the juryâ€™s underlying \r\n  decision, but a change in form is one which merely corrects a technical error \r\n  made by the jury.Â  The judge cannot, under the guise of amending the verdict, \r\n  invade the province of the jury or substitute his verdict for theirs.Â  After \r\n  the amendment, the verdict must be not what the judge thinks it ought to have \r\n  been, but what the jury intended it to be. \r\n\r\nVinson, 324 S.C. at 406, \r\n  477 S.E.2d at 724 (citing 75B Am.Jur.2d Trial Â§ 1886 (1992)).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWhile a trial judge may have the right in certain instances in a civil case \r\n  to make, or order made, a correction in the verdict of a jury, after discharge \r\n  of the jury, for the purpose of giving effect to what the jury unmistakably \r\n  found, that power is limited strictly to cases where the jury has expressed \r\n  their finding in an informal manner but the Judge cannot, under the power of \r\n  amending the verdict, invade the province of the jury or substitute his verdict \r\n  for theirs.\r\n\r\nLorick &amp; Lowrance, Inc. \r\n  v. Julius H. Walker &amp; Co., 153 S.C. 309, 319, 150 S.E. 789, 792 (1929) \r\n  (citations and quotations omitted).Â  â€œThe law rather forbids this court assuming \r\n  to take upon itself the powers, duties, rights, and privileges of a jury.â€Â  \r\n  Anderson v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 175 S.C. 254, 282, 178 S.E. 819, \r\n  829 (1934).Â  â€œObviously, the absolute power to change or modify the findings \r\n  of a jury upon an issue of fact properly submitted to them would, when exercised, \r\n  amount to the substitution of the trial judgeâ€™s findings for the verdict of \r\n  the jury and to the abrogation in such cases of the right of trial by jury.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 283, 178 S.E. at 830.\r\nIn the current case, \r\n  the judge decided that because the jury found punitive damages on the state \r\n  law false imprisonment claim, all of the elements underlying the federal claim \r\n  were met.Â  Accordingly, the trial court reformed the Â§1983 verdict in Respondentâ€™s \r\n  favor.Â  Essentially, the court ruled that because the elements for both causes \r\n  of action were, in its opinion, the same, the verdicts were inconsistent.Â  However, \r\n  it is not for the trial court to say what it thinks the verdict should be.Â  \r\n  We find the trial court improperly gave preference to one verdict over the other \r\n  and by so doing improvidently invaded the province of the jury.Â  We rule the \r\n  trial court erred in reforming the Â§1983 verdict in Respondentâ€™s favor.\r\nIII.Â  New Trial\r\nAlternatively, Appellant claims \r\n  the trial court erred in granting Respondentâ€™s motion to reform the verdict \r\n  because Respondent failed to move for a new trial.Â  Along with articulating \r\n  when a trial court should reform a verdict, in Vinson, this court clearly \r\n  stated â€œ[a] party seeking amendment of a verdict must lay a proper foundation \r\n  by a motion for a new trial.â€Â  Vinson, 324 at 407, 477 S.E.2d at 724 \r\n  (citing Anderson v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 175 S.C. 254, 178 S.E. \r\n  819 (1934)); see Dowd v. Imperial Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 298 \r\n  S.C. 439, 441, 381 S.E.2d 212, 213 (Ct. App. 1989) (citing New York Carpet \r\n  World v. Houston, 292 S.C. 101, 354 S.E.2d 924 (Ct. App. 1987)).Â  â€œAny question \r\n  affecting the verdict should be raised by a motion for a new trial.â€Â  Vinson, \r\n  324 S.C. at 407, 477 S.E.2d at 724. \r\nâ€œA juryâ€™s verdict should be upheld \r\n  when possible to do so and to carry into effect what was clearly juryâ€™s intentions.Â  \r\n  But when the verdict is so confused that it is not absolutely clear what was \r\n  intended, the court should order a new trial.â€Â  Anderson, 175 S.C. at \r\n  283-84, 178 S.E. at 830.Â  A party that seeks an amendment to a verdict must \r\n  make a motion for a new trial.Â  Id. at 280, 178 S.E. at 829.Â  â€œThe authority \r\n  of a circuit court judge to correct, modify, or interfere with the verdict of \r\n  a jury in a case properly triable by jury is embraced in and limited to the \r\n  power to grant new trials.â€Â  Id.Â  at 283-84, 178 S.E. at 829.Â  â€œIf in \r\n  the estimate of the trial court, the verdict of the jury is wrong and erroneous, \r\n  the court can avoid it only by setting it aside and granting a new trial.â€Â  \r\n  Stone &amp; Clamp, Gen. Contractors v. Holmes, 217 S.C. 203, 233, 60 \r\n  S.E.2d 231 (1950).Â \r\nWe hold the trial court erred in \r\n  reforming the Â§1983 verdict, as Respondent did not lay the proper foundation \r\n  by making a motion for a new trial.\r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  Fees\r\nAppellant contends any \r\n  error in reconciling the two verdicts is not harmless, as finding Appellant \r\n  liable under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 subjects her to attorneyâ€™s fees totaling over \r\n  $40,000.Â  In view of our reversal of the case, we decline to address the issue \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983. \r\nV.Â  Inconsistency \r\n  of the Verdicts\r\nAppellant maintains the \r\n  trial court erred in concluding the two verdicts were inconsistent as returned \r\n  by the jury.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, an \r\n  appellate court must uphold a jury verdict if it is possible to reconcile its \r\n  various features.Â  Rhodes v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 249 S.C. 526, \r\n  530, 155 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1967); Dowd v. Imperial Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., \r\n  298 S.C. 439, 441, 381 S.E.2d 212, 213 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Furthermore, â€œa jury \r\n  verdict should be upheld when it is possible to do so and carry into effect \r\n  the juryâ€™s clear intention.â€Â  Johnson v. Parker, 279 S.C. 132, 135, 303 \r\n  S.E.2d 95, 97 (1983); Joiner v. Bevier, 155 S.C. 340, 380, 152 S.E. 652, \r\n  656 (1930); Billups v. Leliuga, 303 S.C. 36, 39, 398 S.E.2d 75, 76 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1990).\r\nA priori, this court \r\n  emphasizes that the claim posited by Respondent is a Fourth Amendment claim \r\n  under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  In Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. \r\n  1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989), the United States Supreme Court edifies:\r\n\r\nThis case requires us to decide what constitutional standard governs a free \r\n  citizenâ€™s claim that law enforcement officials used excessive force in the course \r\n  of making an arrest, investigatory stop, or other â€œseizureâ€ of his person.Â  \r\n  We hold that such claims are properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s \r\n  â€œobjective reasonablenessâ€ standard, rather than under a substantive due process \r\n  standard.\r\n. . . .\r\nA â€œseizureâ€ triggering the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s protections \r\n  occurs only when government actors have, â€œby means of physical force or show \r\n  of authority, . . . in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen,â€ Terry \r\n  v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19, n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879, n. 16, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 \r\n  (1968); see Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596, 109 S.Ct. \r\n  1378, 1381, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989).\r\n\r\nGraham, 490 U.S. at 388 and 395 n. 10, 109 \r\n  S.Ct. at 1867-68 and 1871 n. 10, 104 L.Ed.2d at 450 and 455 n. 10.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Robles \r\n  v. Prince Georgeâ€™s County, 302 F.3d 262 (4th Cir. 2002) explicates: \r\n\r\n\r\nWe begin by considering Roblesâ€™ federal constitutional \r\n  claims.Â  In order to make out a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983, Robles must \r\n  show that (1) the actions of the police officers deprived him of an actual constitutional \r\n  right and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged \r\n  violation.Â  Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d \r\n  818 (1999).Â  Only if both parts of this inquiry are satisfied can Robles overcome \r\n  the defendantsâ€™ assertion of qualified immunity. \r\nRobles contends that the PGC officers violated \r\n  his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures.Â  He asserts \r\n  that â€œ[b]ecause there was no legitimate reason to handcuff [him] to a pole and \r\n  abandon him, the manner of his seizure was unreasonable.â€\r\nThe Fourth Amendment â€œgoverns claims of excessive \r\n  force during the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other â€˜seizureâ€™ \r\n  of a person.â€Â  Riley v. Dorton, 115 F.3d 1159, 1161 (4th Cir. \r\n  1997) (en banc).Â  However, this court has rejected any concept of a continuing \r\n  seizure rule, noting that â€œthe Fourth Amendment . . . applies to the initial \r\n  decision to detain an accused, not to the conditions of confinement after that \r\n  decision has been made.â€Â  Id. at 1163 (internal citations and punctuation \r\n  omitted).Â  Once the single act of detaining an individual has been accomplished, \r\n  the Amendment ceases to apply.Â  Id. \r\n  Robles acknowledges that the police had probable cause for his arrest.Â  The \r\n  officers were acting on the basis of an outstanding warrant issued by Montgomery \r\n  County which contained five charges against Robles stemming from a vehicular \r\n  hit and run accident the previous year.Â  Robles also admits that Rozar and DeBarros \r\n  did not use excessive force when they took custody of him.Â  The officers made \r\n  clear the reason for his arrest, handcuffed him, and placed him in the back \r\n  of a police cruiser without incident.\r\n  Â \r\n\r\nRobles, 302 F.3d at 268.\r\nThere are a number of logical reasons \r\n  why the jury could have legitimately returned a verdict in Respondentâ€™s favor \r\n  on the state law false imprisonment claim, but a verdict for Appellant on the \r\n  federal claim.Â  The jury could reasonably have determined Appellant was entitled \r\n  to qualified or â€œgood faithâ€ immunity on the federal claim, as she was following \r\n  a direct order from Captain Turner when she placed Appellant under arrest.Â  \r\n  The parties do not dispute that Captain Turner ordered Appellant to transport \r\n  Respondent to the police station.Â  The jury could have reasonably found Appellant \r\n  liable on the state law false imprisonment claim because this claim does not \r\n  recognize a good faith immunity defense.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 provides:\r\n\r\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, \r\n  regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, \r\n  subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other \r\n  person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, \r\n  or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party \r\n  injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for \r\n  redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an \r\n  act or omission taken in such officerâ€™s judicial capacity, injunctive relief \r\n  shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory \r\n  relief was unavailable.\r\n\r\nTo assert a claim under 42 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the actions of the police officers \r\n  deprived him of an actual constitutional right and (2) the right was clearly \r\n  established at the time of the alleged violation.Â  Wilson v. Layne, 526 \r\n  U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1697, 143 L.Ed.2d 818, 827 (1999).Â  â€œ[A] court \r\n  must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an \r\n  actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether \r\n  that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.â€Â  Conn \r\n  v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 1295, 143 L.Ed.2d 399, 405 \r\n  (1999).\r\nâ€œ[T]he only immunities available \r\n  to the defendant in an official- capacity action are those that the governmental \r\n  entity possesses.â€Â  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 362, \r\n  116 L.Ed.2d 301, 309 (1991).Â  â€œThe doctrine of qualified immunity shields police \r\n  officers acting in their official capacity from suits for damages under 42 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1983, unless their actions violate clearly-established rights of which an \r\n  objectively reasonable official would have known.â€Â  Rogers v. City of Amsterdam, \r\n  303 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Thomas v. Roach, 165 F.3d 137, \r\n  142 (2d Cir. 1999)); accord Williams v. Gourd, 142 F.Supp.2d 416, \r\n  428 (2001).Â  â€œThis policy is justified in part by the risk that the â€˜fear of \r\n  personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials \r\n  in the discharge of their duties.â€™â€Â  Williams, 142 F.Supp.2d at 428 (quoting \r\n  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d \r\n  523 (1987)).Â  If the plaintiff alleges â€œan arrest without probable cause, an \r\n  arresting officer may assert the defense of qualified immunity if â€˜either (a) \r\n  it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause \r\n  existed, or (b) officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether \r\n  the probable cause test was met.â€™â€Â  Rogers, 303 F.3d at 158 (quoting \r\n  Golino v. City of New Haven, 950 F.2d 864, 870 (2d Cir. 1991)).Â  Because \r\n  qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, the defendant bears the burden \r\n  of proving the challenged act was objectively reasonable in light of the existing \r\n  law.Â  Varrone v. Bilotti, 123 F.3d 75,Â  78 (2d Cr. 1997).Â  The United \r\n  States Supreme Court has held a clearly established statutory or constitutional \r\n  right â€œmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand \r\n  what he is doing violates that right.Â  This is not to say that an official action \r\n  is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously \r\n  been held unlawful; but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the \r\n  unlawfulness must be apparent.â€Â  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. \r\n  at 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d at 531.\r\nThe qualified immunity \r\n  defense has been recognized to extend to situations when a police officer is \r\n  merely following the orders of a superior officer.Â  In Bilida v. McCleod, \r\n  211 F.3d 166 (1st Cir. 2000), the First Circuit Court of Appeals explained the \r\n  concept:Â  â€œPlausible instructions from a superior or fellow officer support \r\n  qualified immunity where, viewed objectively in light of the surrounding circumstances, \r\n  they could lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the necessary legal justification \r\n  for his actions exists (e.g. a warrant, probable cause, exigent circumstances).â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 174-175 (citations omitted); see also Varrone, 123 \r\n  F.3d at 81 (finding that a prison official had qualified immunity for carrying \r\n  out his supervisorâ€™s directive, even though he did not independently investigate \r\n  the basis and reason for the order).\r\nIt is uncontested Appellant \r\n  was instructed to transport Respondent to the police station by her superior, \r\n  Captain Turner.Â  Therefore, it is logical the jury felt Appellant was entitled \r\n  to qualified immunity on the federal claim.Â  The trial court did not refer to \r\n  â€œqualified immunityâ€ in its instructions to the jury.Â  Rather, the court used \r\n  the synonymous phrase â€œgood faith.â€ This is especially apparent when one considers \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s instruction on this issue:\r\n\r\nI charge you also that not every error of law or \r\n  fact on the part of a police officer will subject her to liability under the \r\n  Civil Rights Act.Â  An arrest is often a stressful and unstable situation calling \r\n  for discretion and evaluation by the police officer.Â  Thus, an officer acting \r\n  in good faith is not liable for the arrest even if it should be determined . \r\n  . . that the officer was in error.Â  I further instruct you that is inevitable \r\n  that law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly \r\n  conclude that probable cause is present.\r\nAnd we haveâ€”and in those types of cases, the official \r\n  may not be held personally liable if you find, of course, the person acted in \r\n  good faith.Â  Because in such a situation, a plaintiff making an arrest, there \r\n  is a defense of good faith and probable cause that is available to them in \r\n  a 1983 action.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe jury could have logically \r\n  found Appellant was entitled to the good faith defense on the federal cause \r\n  of action, but not on the state law cause of action.Â  We find the trial court \r\n  erred in ruling the verdicts were inconsistent and subsequently reforming the \r\n  Â§1983 verdict in Respondentâ€™s favor.\r\nPunitive Damages/Qualified \r\n  Immunity Defense\r\nThroughout his brief, Respondent \r\n  repeatedly argues the trial court was correct in concluding the Appellant could \r\n  not be subject to punitive damages and yet still be entitled to a qualified \r\n  immunity (good faith) defense on the federal claim.Â  This argument is based \r\n  on the idea that to award punitive damages, it must be proved by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence that Appellant acted â€œintentionally, willfully, wantonly, or recklessly.â€Â  \r\n  Because the jury found punitive damages,Â  it must have believed Appellant acted \r\n  willfully or recklessly.Â  Thus, Appellant could not have acted in good faith \r\n  under the federal claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nA number of cases addressing the \r\n  qualified immunity, or good faith defense, have squarely rejected the idea championed \r\n  by Respondent.Â  In Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 118 S. Ct. 1584, \r\n  140 L.Ed.2d 759, (1988), the United States Supreme Court noted â€œa defense of \r\n  qualified immunity may not be rebutted by evidence that the defendantâ€™s conduct \r\n  was malicious or otherwise improperly motivated.â€Â  Id. at 588, 118 S. \r\n  Ct. at 1592, 140 L.Ed.2d at 773; see Ulichny v. Merton Cmty. Sch. \r\n  Dist., 93 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1042 n.21 (E.D. Wis. 2000) (finding defense of \r\n  qualified immunity may not be rebutted by evidence that defendantâ€™s conduct \r\n  was malicious or otherwise improperly motivated); Brown v. Ives, 129 \r\n  F.3d 209, 211 (1st Cir. 1997) (â€œThe test is objective; claims of \r\n  malice do not overcome qualified immunity.â€); Adams v. Treen, 671 F.2d \r\n  892, 896 (5th Cir. 1982) (â€œQualified immunity now depends on the \r\n  objective reasonableness of an officialâ€™s conduct, as measured by reference \r\n  to clearly established law, not upon malice or other subjective factors.â€).Â Â  \r\n  â€œThe subjective malice or bad faith of the official is irrelevant, and the only \r\n  inquiry is whether a reasonable person could have believed his actions lawful \r\n  at the time they were undertaken.â€Â  Leibowitz v. United States Depâ€™t of Justice, \r\n  729 F.Supp. 556, 561 (E.D.Mich.S.Div. 1989).Â Â  The qualified immunity â€œstandard \r\n  eliminates from consideration allegations about the officialâ€™s subjective state \r\n  of mind, such as bad faith or malicious intention, concentrating the inquiry \r\n  upon the â€œobjective reasonablenessâ€ of the official conduct.Â  Floyd v. Farrell, \r\n  765 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1985).Â  It is clear that even if Appellant \r\n  did act in a manner sufficient to support an award of punitive damages on the \r\n  false imprisonment claim, this does nothing to preempt a good faith defense \r\n  on the federal claim.Â  See also Robles v. Prince Georgeâ€™s County, \r\n  302 F.3d 262 (4th Cir. 2002) (finding defendants entitled to good faith defense, \r\n  but nevertheless liable for actual and punitive damages under a state law claim).Â  \r\n  We reject the contention that a jury verdict awarding punitive damages preempts \r\n  a good faith defense in a 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the trial court \r\n  erred because: (1) Respondent did not raise the â€œinconsistenciesâ€ in the verdicts \r\n  until after the jury was discharged; (2) the court favored one verdict over \r\n  the other and thereby invaded the province of the jury; (3) Respondent failed \r\n  to move for a new trial; and (4) the verdicts as returned by the jury were necessarily \r\n  inconsistent.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s reformation of the Â§ 1983 verdict \r\n  is\r\nREVERSED. \r\n  [1] \r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The jury verdict on the common law false imprisonment claim in the \r\n    amount of $3000 actual damages and $3000 punitive damages is not appealed \r\n    and that verdict remains intact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3821","title":"Venture Engineering, Inc. v.

(â€œVentureâ€) \r\n  brought a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure action against Tishman Construction of \r\n  South Carolina, Timberland Properties, Inc., and the South Carolina Public Service \r\n  Authority (â€œSantee Cooperâ€).Â  Venture appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order finding \r\n  that Ventureâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien did not encumber property owned by Santee Cooper.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn May 1995, Timberland Properties, Inc., \r\n  (â€œTimberlandâ€) purchased approximately 422 acres of real estate owned by the \r\n  State of South Carolina but managed by Santee Cooper.Â  As part of the sale, \r\n  Timberland agreed to develop the land within twelve months of the date of purchase.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, the parties entered an Amendment to Right to Repurchase granting \r\n  Timberland a ninety-day extension to begin construction of the proposed development. \r\n  According to the agreement, if Timberland failed to begin development within \r\n  the prescribed period, Santee Cooper had the right to repurchase the property \r\n  together with all improvements for the original sale price.Â  Both the contract \r\n  and deed, along with the Amendment, were properly recorded in Horry County. \r\n\r\nIn February 1995, Timberland hired Venture \r\n  to perform services in connection with Timberlandâ€™s development of the property.Â  \r\n  However, Timberland failed to pay for Ventureâ€™s services and Venture filed a \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien in the amount of $127,786.74 against the property on May 6, \r\n  1997.Â  Around the same time, Timberland failed to comply with the terms of its \r\n  agreement with Santee Cooper, prompting Santee Cooper to exercise its right \r\n  to repurchase the property on May 17, 1997.Â  Venture initiated the present action \r\n  in circuit court in September 1997, seeking to foreclose on the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n  filed against the property. \r\nIn June 1997, Timberland voluntarily sought \r\n  Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.Â  Santee Cooper filed an Adversary Proceeding \r\n  in bankruptcy court for a declaratory judgment seeking formal adjudication of \r\n  Santee Cooperâ€™s ownership claims in the property and seeking a ruling Timberland \r\n  had no rights to the property.Â  The bankruptcy trustee counterclaimed, asserting \r\n  that whatever interests Santee Cooper had came about through fraud and preferential \r\n  treatment.Â  Â Â In essence, the trustee claimed that Timberlandâ€™s transfer \r\n  of the property was avoidable and, as trustee, he was invoking his right to \r\n  avoid the transfer. [1] \r\nIn February 1999, the bankruptcy court issued a \r\n  Notice of Settlement and Sale, advising Timberlandâ€™s creditors that Timberlandâ€™s \r\n  bankruptcy trustee intended to submit a proposed settlement for the bankruptcy \r\n  courtâ€™s approval. Among other things, the proposed settlement indicated the \r\n  trustee would sell the property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the notice provided that any party objecting to the proposed settlement \r\n  was to submit a written objection within twenty days, pursuant to Rule 9014, \r\n  District of South Carolina Bankruptcy Rules.Â  Venture, named as a creditor, \r\n  received a copy of the notice, but did not file any objection. \r\nThe bankruptcy court approved the proposed settlement \r\n  and sale in April 1999.Â  The property was transferred to WBLC, LLC \r\n  [2]  â€œfree and clear of all liens and encumbrances in accordance with 11 \r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 363.â€Â  \r\nFollowing the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceeding, \r\n  Ventureâ€™s foreclosure action was referred to the master-in-equity.Â  The master \r\n  dismissed Ventureâ€™s claim with prejudice.Â  The master found as a matter of law \r\n  that Ventureâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien could not be enforced, that the bankruptcy court \r\n  approved the sale of the property, and that Ventureâ€™s claim was barred by res \r\n  judicata, waiver and equitable estoppel.Â  Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Did the master err when he gave effect to deed language, which should have been \r\n  void?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Did the master err when he allowed a subsequent purchaser to purchase land without \r\n  regard to a previously filed mechanicâ€™s lien?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in holding that a seller of property, who sells on condition \r\n  that the buyer develop it, can retake the property without regard to any mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien for work performed to develop the property?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         4.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in holding that the bankruptcy sale was valid?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nVenture raises four issues for review by this \r\n  Court; however, we feel that Ventureâ€™s fourth issue is dispositive of the case.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Venture argues the master erred in holding the bankruptcy sale was \r\n  valid.Â  We disagree. We believe that Venture misapprehends the extent of the \r\n  bankruptcy courtâ€™s jurisdiction, as well as the jurisdiction of this court.\r\nVenture does not contest the bankruptcy courtâ€™s \r\n  jurisdiction or the validity of the sale of the bankruptâ€™s property; however, \r\n  Venture argues that the property in question was incorrectly included in the \r\n  bankruptâ€™s estate.Â  Ventureâ€™s argument before the master and this court is not \r\n  efficacious.Â  Venture should have made this argument in the bankruptcy court.\r\nA.Â  The Bankruptcy Case\r\nA bankruptcy estate is comprised of all legal or \r\n  equitable interests of a debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.Â  \r\n  11 U.S.C. Â§ 541(a)(1) (1988).Â  The trusteeâ€™s assertion of his right to avoid \r\n  the alleged fraudulent or preferential transfer to Santee Cooper resulted in \r\n  the estate retaining an equitable interest in the property.Â  A transferee may \r\n  have colorable title to the property, but the equitable interest â€“ at least \r\n  as far as the creditors (but not the debtor) are concerned â€“ is considered to \r\n  remain in the debtor so that creditors may attach or execute judgment on the \r\n  property as though the debtor had never transferred it.Â  In re Mortgageamerica \r\n  Corp., 714 F.2d 1266, 1275 (5th Cir. 1983). [3] Â  â€œ[W]hen such a debtor is forced into bankruptcy, it makes \r\n  the most sense to consider the debtor as continuing to have a legal or equitable \r\n  interest in the property fraudulently transferred within the meaning of section \r\n  541(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the bankruptcy \r\n  court had jurisdiction. \r\nDuring the bankruptcy proceeding, Venture was a \r\n  named creditor and received proper notice of the settlement and request to sell \r\n  the property free and clear of all liens. \r\n  [4] Â  Venture failed to take the necessary action to protect its lien against \r\n  the property. [5] Â  The specific question before \r\n  the bankruptcy court was whether the trustee and the debtor had rights in the \r\n  property in question.Â  The bankruptcy court allowed the parties to resolve the \r\n  dispute by settlement.Â  The settlement required the trustee to convey, by quit \r\n  claim deed, his interest in the property to Santee Cooper and for Santee Cooper \r\n  to sell the property to a third party.Â  The trustee would receive $2,000,000.00.Â  \r\n  The bankruptcy court approved the sale free and clear of all liens and encumbrances \r\n  in accordance with 11 U.S.C. Â§ 363.Â  \r\nThe bankruptcy court found that the settlement was \r\n  a â€œglobal resolutionâ€ of the adversary proceeding and that the manner in which \r\n  the settlement was structured necessitated the bankruptcy courtâ€™s acceptance \r\n  or rejection of the entire transaction, including the sale of the property to \r\n  WBLC.Â  Even though two creditors objected to the settlement, the bankruptcy \r\n  court overruled the objections and approved the settlement.Â  The proposed settlement \r\n  involved the issue of ownership of the property.Â  If there was a question concerning \r\n  the propertyâ€™s ownership, the bankruptcy court was the proper forum to address \r\n  those issues.\r\nMoreover, Ventureâ€™s failure to seek a stay of the \r\n  sale renders the question of whether the land was property of the bankruptâ€™s \r\n  estate moot.Â  See In re Sax, 796 F.2d 994, 996 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1986) (reasoning that if the property in question was not a part of the \r\n  bankruptâ€™s estate, appeal from order approving its sale was rendered moot for \r\n  failure of the lien holder to obtain a stay of sale, even though sale was improper); \r\n  see also In re Vetter, 724 F.2d 52, 55 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1983); 11 U.S.C Â§ 363(m) (1988).\r\nB.Â  The Master-In-Equity Case\r\nThe master found, and we agree, Venture is bound \r\n  by the doctrine of res judicata.Â  â€œThe doctrine of res judicata provides that \r\n  final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies \r\n  from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in that action.â€Â  \r\n  In re S.N.A. Nut Co., 215 B.R. 1004, 1008 (1997); see also \r\n  Plum Creek Dev. Co., Inc. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d \r\n  106, 109 (1999) (â€œUnder the doctrine of res judicata, â€˜[a] litigant is barred \r\n  from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues \r\n  which might have been raised in the former suit.â€).Â  â€œTo establish res judicata, \r\n  the defendant must prove the following three elements: (1) identity of the parties; \r\n  (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the \r\n  former suit.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œBankruptcy proceedings \r\n  are in rem. All persons concerned, including creditors, are deemed to \r\n  be parties to the [bankruptcy] proceedings.â€ Miller v. R. K. A. Mgmt. Corp., \r\n  160 Cal. Rptr. 164, 169 (Cal. Ct. App. 1979) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n  As one of Timberlandâ€™s creditors, Venture was deemed to be a party in the bankruptcy \r\n  action.Â  The property was the subject matter in issue in both proceedings.Â  \r\n  The bankruptcy court ruled on the property issue, finally resolving all issues \r\n  of ownership.\r\nIn bankruptcy matters, orders approving the sale \r\n  of a debtorâ€™s property are considered final decisions and are immediately appealable.Â  \r\n  In re Sax, 796 F.2d at 996. This matter was resolved when the bankruptcy \r\n  court ordered the sale of the property free and clear of any liens and encumbrances. [6] Â  Venture could have sought a stay of sale and immediately appealed \r\n  to the federal court; however, Venture failed to do so.Â  The doctrine of res \r\n  judicata bars any subsequent action on Ventureâ€™s behalf.\r\nWhen a bankruptcy court's order is erroneous, it \r\n  is correctable only through the federal court and, under the circumstances, \r\n  the trial court and this court are required to accept the bankruptcy court's \r\n  order as it was rendered and entered.Â  See Fowler v. Fowler, 474 \r\n  So.2d 719, 720 (Ct. App. Ala. 1985); see also In re Atlanta \r\n  Retail, Inc., 294 B.R. 186, 195 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (â€œOrders of courts having \r\n  jurisdiction to enter them must be obeyed until reversed, even if proper grounds \r\n  exist to challenge them. A challenge for error may be directed to the ordering \r\n  court or a higher court, ... but it may not be made collaterally.â€).Â  Moreover, \r\n  this Court is unable to render an opinion on the merits of Ventureâ€™s claims \r\n  because the master concluded that Ventureâ€™s claim was barred by res judicata, \r\n  waiver, and equitable estoppel.Â  Venture did not appeal the masterâ€™s decision \r\n  on these grounds.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the Master is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Trustees have the power to avoid fraudulent or preferential pre-petition \r\n    transfers and obligations.Â  See 11 U.S.C.

Quinn, of Columbia, for Appellants.Â  \r\nJohn S. Nichols, and Melvin Dean Bannister, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Mary Rowell brought this \r\n  action against Arthur and Judith Whisnant to determine the amount due under \r\n  a note and mortgage, including fees and costs, and to foreclose the mortgage.Â  \r\n  The circuit court refused to grant foreclosure, but awarded Rowell attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees of $7,500.Â  The Whisnants appeal. \r\n  [1]  Â We affirm in part and remand for further findings. \r\nFACTS\r\nWhisnant executed a â€œMortgage Noteâ€ agreeing \r\n  to repay Rowell $22,000 with 13% interest per annum.Â  Among other things, the \r\n  note provided payments were to be made in ten equal annual installments with \r\n  the first installment due one year after the noteâ€™s signing.Â  \r\nAdditional pertinent provisions of the note provide as follows:\r\n\r\nIF at any time any portion of the principal or interest \r\n  be past due and unpaid, the whole amount evidenced by this Note shall, at the \r\n  option of the holder, become immediately due and payable, and the holder shall \r\n  have the right to institute any proceedings upon this Note and any lien given \r\n  to secure the same for the purpose of collecting the principal and interest, \r\n  with costs and expenses, or of protecting any security connected herewith.Â  \r\n  Failure to exercise this option shall not constitute waiver of the right to \r\n  exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default.\r\nIN the event of default in the payment of this Note, and \r\n  if it is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, the undersigned \r\n  hereby agree(s) to pay all costs of collection, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee. \r\n\r\nThe note was secured by a mortgage on real property \r\n  owned by Whisnant.Â  The mortgage also contained a provision regarding attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees which provided â€œIT IS AGREED by and between the parties, that in the case \r\n  of foreclosure of this mortgage, by suit or otherwise, the mortgagee shall recover \r\n  of the mortgagor a reasonable sum as attorneyâ€™s fee, which shall be secured \r\n  by this mortgage, and shall be included in judgment of foreclosure.â€Â  \r\nWhisnantâ€™s payment history was erratic until Rowell \r\n  obtained services of an attorney for collection.Â  In fact, when Rowell hired \r\n  her attorney, the payments Whisnant had made were not even sufficient to cover \r\n  the interest that had accrued.Â  Whisnant made intermittent payments from this \r\n  time until the noteâ€™s principal and interest were paid in full nearly sixteen \r\n  years after it was executed. Â At trial, Whisnant admitted being behind on the \r\n  note, making late payments, and that some of his payments followed phone calls \r\n  or letters from Rowellâ€™s attorney.Â  Rowellâ€™s attorney sent a number of dunning \r\n  letters to Whisnant, most also requesting attorneyâ€™s fees in varying amountsâ€”the \r\n  most recent requesting fees in the amount of $7,500.Â  \r\nAlthough payments were rarely, if ever, made on time and \r\n  several letters threatened Whisnant with foreclosure, Rowell continued to accept \r\n  Whisnantâ€™s payments.Â  Rowell commenced this action a few months after Whisnantâ€™s \r\n  final payment on the note. Â \r\nIn her complaint, Rowell sought a determination of the amount \r\n  due under the note and mortgage, including fees and costs, and sought foreclosure \r\n  and sale of the mortgaged property.Â  The Whisnants answered and counterclaimed \r\n  (1) that the suit was frivolous under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings \r\n  Sanctions Act; [2]  and (2) that \r\n  Rowellâ€™s failure to discharge and satisfy the mortgage as required by South \r\n  Carolina law resulted in damages to them in the amount of $11,000. \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nFollowing a bench trial, the circuit court issued \r\n  its order, refusing to grant foreclosure but awarding Rowell attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  in the amount of $7,500.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Foreclosure \r\nThe Whisnants argue Rowell is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees under the mortgage because foreclosure was denied.Â  Additionally, they \r\n  contend the amount of the award is unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.Â  \r\n  We find no error in the courtâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees, but remand \r\n  for a fact-specific determination of the appropriate amount of the award.\r\nThe Whisnantsâ€™ argument that Rowell is not entitled \r\n  to attorneyâ€™s fees is premised on their erroneous assertion that because the \r\n  mortgage did not incorporate the note by reference, the intent of the parties \r\n  must be construed solely from the mortgageâ€™s terms.Â  Relying on this premise, \r\n  the Whisnants then argue that because the mortgage only provides for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees in the event of a foreclosure, they are unavailable when, as here, the \r\n  foreclosure action is denied.Â  \r\nHowever, Rowell was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  under the note itself.Â  As set out above, the note specifically provides that \r\n  â€œif it is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, the undersigned \r\n  hereby agree(s) to pay all costs of collection, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  The Whisnants do not dispute that the note was \r\n  placed with an attorney for collection or that it remained with the attorney \r\n  until repayment of the principal and interest was completed.Â  The bulk of the \r\n  principal and interest payments were made only after the note was turned over \r\n  to her attorney and collected by Rowell because of his intervention and efforts.Â  \r\n  A reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee is therefore due under the note.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant Rowell attorneyâ€™s fees despite its \r\n  refusal to foreclose the mortgage.Â  \r\nHowever, we are unable to affirm the amount of \r\n  the award.Â  Six factors are normally considered in determining an award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees:Â  â€œ(1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) \r\n  time and labor devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) \r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) fee customarily charged in the locality for \r\n  similar services; and (6) beneficial results obtained.â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, \r\n  Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993).Â  Trial courts should \r\n  make specific findings of fact on the record for each of the factors set out \r\n  above.Â  In fact, â€œ[o]n appeal, absent sufficient evidentiary support on the \r\n  record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded \r\n  for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Id. at 494, \r\n  427 S.E.2d at 661. \r\nThe only evidence in the record as to attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees is the affidavit of Rowellâ€™s collection attorney.Â  At best, this affidavit \r\n  merely provides a general description of the tasks he performed.Â  Although the \r\n  record shows counsel authored ten or eleven letters over a thirteen-year period, \r\n  and that payments were tendered through him, this alone is not enough to support \r\n  the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees awarded.Â  Accordingly, because the trial court \r\n  did not make specific findings of fact as to each of the six factors and there \r\n  are not enough facts in the record to support the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  awarded, we remand the award of attorneyâ€™s fees for such findings to be made.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Estoppel\r\nThe Whisnants argue alternatively that Rowell should \r\n  be equitably estopped from claiming a default on the note because of her â€œlong-continuedâ€ \r\n  course of accepting late payments.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs discussed previously, the note clearly provided \r\n  Whisnant would be responsible for reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees in the event the \r\n  note was placed with an attorney for collection.Â  Whisnant admits to being late \r\n  on the note and to making the final payment well after it was due.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Rowellâ€™s attorney made Whisnant well aware of the intention to seek attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees under the note, as at least five of the letters written to Whisnant specifically \r\n  ask for the fees to be paid.Â  Therefore, we find this argument to be without \r\n  merit.\r\nÂ III.Â  Satisfaction of Mortgage\r\nThe Whisnants next\r\nargue the trial court erred in not requiring satisfaction of the note and\r\nmortgage pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-3-310 (Supp. 2003).&nbsp;\r\nAgain, we disagree.&nbsp;\r\nSection 310 calls for the satisfaction of mortgages \r\n  by â€œ[a]ny holder of record of a mortgage who has received full payment or satisfaction \r\n  . . . [of the debt and other charges] secured by a mortgage of real estate.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  As Rowell correctly notes, Whisnant has not provided â€œfull payment \r\n  or satisfactionâ€ of the underlying note the mortgage secures because attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees are owed on the note.Â  Thus the trial court properly held Rowell need not \r\n  satisfy the mortgage until Whisnant has paid the appropriate amount of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Thus, we hold the mortgage must be satisfied upon payment of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees due under the note.\r\nBecause our treatment of the issues to this point \r\n  controls the outcome, we decline to address the Whisnantsâ€™ remaining argument.Â  \r\n  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, \r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not review remaining \r\n  issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees, but remand for specific findings to be entered regarding \r\n  the reasonableness of the amount of the award.\r\nAFFIRMED in part and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The note and mortgage in question were executed only by Arthur.Â  \r\n    However, Judith was originally made a party to this action and has not been \r\n    dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  See S.C.

Richey filed a workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claim against Becton Dickinson and Travelers Property Casualty Co. arising from \r\n  an accident that occurred in 1987.Â  The single commissioner dismissed Richeyâ€™s \r\n  claim based on the doctrine of laches.Â  The appellate panel and the circuit \r\n  court affirmed.Â  We also affirm. [1] \r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 4, 1987, Richey, while working for Becton \r\n  Dickinson, was involved in an accident when steam was blown onto his face.Â  \r\n  Richey filed a Form 50 with the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  on November 23, 1988, alleging injuries to his face and ears and requesting \r\n  a hearing.Â  A hearing was scheduled for March 16, 1989, but was cancelled for \r\n  unknown reasons.Â  Richey filed another Form 50 on March 13, 2000, alleging injuries \r\n  to his ears, face and brain arising from the 1987 accident and requesting a \r\n  hearing.Â  Richeyâ€™s pre-hearing brief also alleged injuries to his cervical spine.Â  \r\n\r\nA hearing before a single commissioner was held on \r\n  August 24, 2000.Â  The parties agreed to resolve the issue of laches prior to \r\n  proceeding with a hearing on the alleged injuries.Â  At the hearing, Richey testified \r\n  that he was not told why the 1989 hearing was cancelled.Â  A handwritten note \r\n  on the hearing notice explained the cancellation, stating, â€œno hearing held; \r\n  issues resolved; claim still open.â€Â  The commission has not retained a file \r\n  on the 1989 claim, nor has the original defense attorney or the insurance carrier.Â  \r\n  Richey testified, however, that he has not received any compensation for this \r\n  claim. \r\nNo evidence exists showing any attempt by Richey to pursue \r\n  his claim during the eleven-year period from the scheduled hearing in 1989 to \r\n  his Form 50 filing in 2000.Â  Richey consulted with several attorneys over this \r\n  period of time, but apparently became frustrated with their services and terminated \r\n  his relationship with them.Â  He testified nothing prevented him from seeking \r\n  additional representation after consulting with the other attorneys, except \r\n  he was â€œworried about finding a good, honest lawyer.â€Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found that Richeyâ€™s claim was barred \r\n  by laches.Â  From this ruling, Richey appealed to the appellate panel of the \r\n  commission, which unanimously affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s ruling.Â  Richey \r\n  appealed to the circuit court and the circuit court affirmed.Â  This appeal \r\n  follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe question of laches is largely a factual one, so each \r\n  case must be judged on its own merits.Â  Mid-State Trust, II v. Wright, \r\n  323 S.C. 303, 307, 474 S.E.2d 421, 423-24 (1996).Â  In a workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  action, the appellate courtâ€™s scope of review extends only to the correction \r\n  of errors of law.Â  Gilliam v. Woodside Mills, 319 S.C. 385, 387, 461 \r\n  S.E.2d 818, 819 (1995).Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRichey contends the circuit court erred in finding his claim was barred by \r\n    the doctrine of laches.Â  Specifically, he argues that pursuant to Halks \r\n    v. Rust Engâ€™g Co., 208 S.C. 39, 47, 36 S.E.2d 852, 855 (1946), a timely \r\n    filed claim remains pending until the case is disposed of by a final award, \r\n    order, or judgment and the burden to request a hearing rests on both parties, \r\n    as well as on the commission.Â  Richey further asserts that no statute or agency \r\n    rule sets a time limit for processing a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  Therefore, \r\n    he submits he should not be punished for his delay because it was not his \r\n    sole responsibility to request a hearing and because the commission, insurance \r\n    carrier, and original defense attorney acted improperly in destroying their \r\n    files.Â  While we agree that the responsibility to request a hearing following \r\n    a Form 50 filing rests not only on the claimant, but also on the responding \r\n    parties and the commission, we find the single commissioner did not err in \r\n    barring Richeyâ€™s claim under the doctrine of laches.&nbsp;\r\n  â€œLaches is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under \r\n    circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should \r\n    have been done.â€Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 296, 519 S.E.2d \r\n    583, 598 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted).Â  Under the doctrine of laches, \r\n    if a party who knows his rights does not timely assert them, and by his delay, \r\n    causes another party to incur expenses or otherwise detrimentally change his \r\n    position, then equity steps in and refuses to enforce those rights.Â  Id. \r\n    at 296, 519 S.E.2d at 599.Â  The party asserting laches has the burden of showing \r\n    negligence, the opportunity to act sooner, and material prejudice.Â  Id. \r\n    at 297, 519 S.E.2d at 599.Â  \r\n  This court has recognized the applicability of the doctrine of laches in a \r\n    workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  See Muir, 336 S.C. at 296-97, \r\n    519 S.E.2d at 598-99 (affirming the commissionerâ€™s finding that the claim \r\n    was not barred by the doctrine of laches because claimant did not act unreasonably \r\n    in pursuing the claim); McMillan v. Midlands Human Res., 305 S.C. 532, \r\n    533, 409 S.E.2d 443, 444 (Ct. App. 1991) (quoting the commissionerâ€™s finding \r\n    that â€œ[a] claimant must prosecute his claim in a timely fashion or it may \r\n    be barred by the doctrine of laches,â€ although the commissionerâ€™s authority \r\n    to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute was not disputed on appeal).Â  \r\n    In Richeyâ€™s case, despite the shared responsibility in requesting a hearing \r\n    set forth in Halks, Respondents nonetheless demonstrated that Richey \r\n    was negligent in pursuing his claim and had the opportunity to act sooner.Â  \r\n    Richeyâ€™s accident occurred in 1987 and he filed his Form 50 request for a \r\n    hearing in 1988.Â  While a hearing was scheduled in 1989, the results of that \r\n    hearing are unknown.Â  The fact that the file no longer exists prevents the \r\n    court from determining what truly happened with Richeyâ€™s claim.Â  In fact, \r\n    the handwritten â€œissues resolvedâ€ note on the hearing notice suggests the \r\n    claim may have been settled.Â  Richey had the opportunity to seek another hearing \r\n    on his claim at any time, yet he offered no reasonable explanation for his \r\n    eleven-year delay.\r\n   Respondents also demonstrated that \r\n    Richeyâ€™s failure to pursue the claim resulted in material prejudice.Â  As stated \r\n    above, the commissionâ€™s file no longer exists.Â  Neither the carrier nor the \r\n    original defense attorney has a file regarding the claim filed in 1988, and \r\n    the result of the original hearing is unknown.Â  Further, Richeyâ€™s most recent \r\n    Form 50 alleges injuries to his brain and cervical spine in addition to the \r\n    injuries to his ears and face alleged in his earlier Form 50.Â  Respondents \r\n    also demonstrated that it would be extremely difficult to depose the physicians \r\n    who examined and treated Richey because some are no longer in practice and \r\n    cannot be located.Â  Additionally, some of the medical records Richey seeks \r\n    to introduce are not on letterhead and do not bear the signatures of the physician.Â  \r\n    We agree with the single commissioner that due to the lack of records and \r\n    time lapse, the proximate cause of Richeyâ€™s additional injuries is difficult \r\n    to ascertain.Â  Moreover, we agree that even if Richeyâ€™s additional injuries \r\n    were a result of the accident in 1987, Respondents were denied the opportunity \r\n    to provide Richey with any appropriate treatment that may have prevented Richeyâ€™s \r\n    additional injuries.Â  \r\n  Thus, we find the circuit court properly \r\n    affirmed the decision of the full commission to apply the doctrine of laches \r\n    to Richeyâ€™s claim.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n   STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     [1]  We affirm this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n      to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3824","title":"SCDSS v.

Sims \r\n  appeals a family court order terminating her parental rights to her two minor \r\n  children. [1] Â  Sims argues the \r\n  order was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. We affirm. [2] \r\nFACTS\r\nSims is the biological mother \r\n  of three children who, at the time of the initial action, were minors.Â  All \r\n  three have different fathers, none of whom played an active role in the childrenâ€™s \r\n  lives.Â  Sims has raised the children with no financial help from the respective \r\n  fathers.Â  She is unemployed and relies on a support check of about $500 per \r\n  month as her sole source of income.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Department of Social \r\n  Services (â€œDSSâ€) first became involved with Sims and her family sometime in \r\n  1993.Â  In 1998, inspection of the family residence revealed several holes in \r\n  the homeâ€™s floor and generally squalid conditions.Â  The children were removed \r\n  from the home at that time and placed into emergency protective custody by law \r\n  enforcement.Â  At the merits hearing, the family court found that Sims physically \r\n  neglected the children because of the deplorable conditions of the home.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Sims was criminally prosecuted for child endangerment and, as a consequence, \r\n  spent a short time in jail.Â  Upon release, she entered a treatment program with \r\n  DSS with the hopes of regaining custody of the children.Â  The treatment program \r\n  was incorporated into the removal order and required Sims find stable and adequate \r\n  housing and maintain adequate living conditions for the children. The order \r\n  specifically required Sims to maintain running water, a clean environment, utilities, \r\n  electricity, and a supply of proper food and clothing.Â  The order prohibited \r\n  Sims from sharing her home with members of her extended family.Â  Sims was also \r\n  ordered to attend parenting classes and vocational rehabilitation.Â  This removal \r\n  order was not appealed.\r\nDSS filed a complaint for the termination \r\n  of Simsâ€™s parental rights to her two youngest children and a hearing was held \r\n  on January 9, 2002.Â  A DSS caseworker testified that Sims successfully completed \r\n  the parenting and vocational training classes required by the DSS treatment \r\n  plan.Â  However, the caseworker stated that Sims has had seven different residences \r\n  since the removal of her children and that in all seven residences, Sims resided \r\n  with other family members.Â  The caseworker visited her at three of the seven \r\n  homes.Â  During a 1999 visit to a residence Sims shared with her mother, the \r\n  caseworker found the home to be severely unkempt.Â  There was little food in \r\n  the house, the floors and sink were very cluttered, and the residents appeared \r\n  to use a bucket for a toilet.Â  At Simsâ€™s next confirmed residence, the caseworker \r\n  observed a slight improvement, but continued to find Simsâ€™s living conditions \r\n  to be unsatisfactory due to clutter.Â  The caseworker visited Simsâ€™s most current \r\n  residence, accompanied by the guardian ad litem, just one day prior to Simsâ€™s \r\n  termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing.Â  As in previous visits, the caseworker \r\n  found this home to be in a â€œdeplorable state.â€Â  The house was cluttered with \r\n  trash and what appeared to be stuffing from an old chair.Â  Dirty dishes and \r\n  bags of beer cans were strewn about the kitchen.Â  The caseworker testified that \r\n  the back room of the house where the children were staying emitted a strange \r\n  odor.Â  The guardian stated that sheets and floors were filthy and the entire \r\n  house smelled like urine.Â  Another DSS caseworker, who was assigned to Simsâ€™s \r\n  twenty-three year old son, also a resident of the home, visited the residence \r\n  regularly and testified that these conditions accurately represented the habitual \r\n  state of the home.Â  \r\nSims testified that she had taken every action \r\n  possible to comply with the treatment program since the removal of her children.Â  \r\n  She stated that she completed the parenting classes and improved her personal \r\n  hygiene.Â  Further, Sims testified that she attempted to comply with the adequate \r\n  housing requirement of the removal order but could not afford a place of her \r\n  own.Â  Sims also offered the testimony of two family friends, who testified to \r\n  her parenting and housekeeping skills.Â  \r\nThe family court terminated Simsâ€™s \r\n  rights to her two youngest children finding that Sims had failed to remedy the \r\n  conditions that caused their removal.Â  The court also found Sims had physically \r\n  neglected the children as defined in section 20-7-490 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code and, because of the repetition of neglect, it was not likely the situation \r\n  could be remedied within twelve months.Â  Alternatively, the family court terminated \r\n  Simsâ€™s parental rights because her children had been in foster care for fifteen \r\n  of the last twenty-two months.Â  Sims appeals.\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the paramount consideration is the best interests of \r\n  the children.Â  See Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 \r\n  S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (April 8, 2004).Â  Grounds \r\n  for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, \r\n  334 S.C. 281, 296, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999); see also Santosky \r\n  v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747-48 (1982) (â€œBefore a State may sever completely \r\n  and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires \r\n  that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.â€).\r\nIn a TPR case, the appellate court may \r\n  review the record and make its own findings of whether clear and convincing \r\n  evidence supports termination.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, \r\n  336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, our broad \r\n  scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility \r\n  of the witnesses.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, \r\n  324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n Sims argues the family court erred in granting \r\n  TPR because DSS failed to prove the statutory grounds for the termination of \r\n  parental rights by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Sims asserts that her living \r\n  situation (i.e. the actual unkempt state of her residence and the fact that \r\n  it was shared with other family members) could have been remedied within twelve \r\n  months, and therefore no ground for termination was proven by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence.Â  We disagree. [3] Â  \r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) outlines the grounds upon which, if coupled with a finding \r\n  that the decision is in the best interest of the child, the parental rights \r\n  of a mother or father may be terminated.Â  Here, the family court, in addition \r\n  to finding termination to be in the best interest of the children, specifically \r\n  found the following statutory grounds applied to Sims and children:\r\n\r\n(1) The child or another child in the home has been harmed \r\n  as defined in Section 20-7-490, [4] \r\n   and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is \r\n  not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  \r\n  In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parentâ€™s previous \r\n  abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be considered.\r\n(2) The child has been removed from the parent . . . , has \r\n  been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a \r\n  placement plan . . . , and the parent has not remedied the conditions which \r\n  caused the removal.\r\n(8) The child has been in foster care under the responsibility \r\n  of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nWe find there is clear and convincing \r\n  evidence in the record to terminate Simsâ€™s parental rights based solely on physical \r\n  neglect of the children and the unlikelihood that the home could be made safe \r\n  within twelve months under section 20-7-1572(1).Â  As determined by the family \r\n  court at the time of the childrenâ€™s removal, the children suffered harm as defined \r\n  by section 20-7-490 because Sims failed to supply them with adequate shelter.Â  \r\n  Since this finding of harm, Sims has not acquired adequate housing for the children \r\n  as required by the order. She has lived in seven different residences and evidence \r\n  was presented by DSS that three of these homes, including Simsâ€™s residence at \r\n  the time of the TPR hearing, were inadequate for children.Â  Sims presented no \r\n  tangible evidence of any future plans to acquire stable and adequate housing.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1572(1) does not require the \r\n  family court to find that improvement of the home within twelve months is impossible, \r\n  but rather that such improvement is not reasonably likely.Â  Because Simsâ€™s inadequate \r\n  living conditions have continued since the childrenâ€™s removal, the family court \r\n  acted within its authority in finding Simsâ€™s home was not reasonably likely \r\n  to be made safe within twelve months.Â  As such, there is clear and convincing \r\n  evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding under section 20-7-1572(1) that \r\n  the children had been harmed and that it was not likely the home would be safe \r\n  within twelve months. \r\nFurthermore, under section 20-7-1572(2), \r\n  it is undisputed that at the time of the TPR hearing the children had been removed \r\n  from the care of Sims and placed under the responsibility of the State for over \r\n  two years.Â  As discussed above, Sims failed to provide adequate and stable living \r\n  arrangements for the children during this time and thus, did not remedy the \r\n  conditions that caused the childrenâ€™s removal.Â  Therefore, we find TPR pursuant \r\n  to section 20-7-1572(2) was supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Sims does not appeal the \r\n  family courtâ€™s finding that the children have been in foster care under the \r\n  responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months \r\n  pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8).Â  A finding pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8) \r\n  alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights.Â  See \r\n  Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. at 580-81, 578 S.E.2d at 735-36. \r\nFinally, we agree with the family courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling that termination of Simsâ€™s parental rights is in the best interest of \r\n  the children.Â  As stated above, clear and convincing evidence was presented \r\n  that Sims failed to maintain adequate living conditions for her children.Â  The \r\n  guardian ad litem testified that prior to their placement in foster care, the \r\n  children lacked personal hygiene skills.Â  The guardian explained that since \r\n  their placement in foster care, their personal hygiene has improved and they \r\n  have learned how to bathe and care for themselves.Â  Further, the guardian stated \r\n  that the children have made great progress since their placement in foster care \r\n  and recommended termination of Simsâ€™s parental rights.Â  \r\nBecause we find clear and convincing evidence to support the grounds \r\n  for terminating Simsâ€™s rights and termination of her rights is in the best interests \r\n  of the children, the TPR order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Simsâ€™s oldest child was seventeen at the time of the commencement \r\n    of this action.Â  Because he was so close to emancipation, DSS chose not to \r\n    include him in this case.Â  Furthermore, Simsâ€™s next oldest child is now eighteen \r\n    and thus no longer a minor.Â  Therefore, this appeal concerns only Simsâ€™s parental \r\n    rights to her youngest son, Demarius, who is now twelve years old.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  We affirm this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  We note that Sims, upon whom the burden of presenting a sufficient \r\n    record for review rests, failed to include the family courtâ€™s TPR order in \r\n    the record on appeal.Â  See Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 \r\n    S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000) (affirming the circuit court on \r\n    one issue because Appellant had not met its burden of presenting an adequate \r\n    record on appeal).Â  This omission alone could justify a finding that the issues \r\n    of this appeal are not preserved for our review.Â  See York v. Conway \r\n    Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997) (â€œThe record \r\n    should include the ruling on appeal.â€); Polson v. Burr, 235 S.C. 216, \r\n    218-219, 110 S.E.2d 855, 856 (1959) (refusing to decide the merits of an appeal \r\n    due to the failure to incorporate in the record the order from which the appeal \r\n    was taken); Rule 210(h), SCACR (â€œ[T]he appellate court will not consider any \r\n    fact which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.â€).Â  Additionally, we could \r\n    find Simsâ€™s issues on appeal abandoned due to their conclusory nature and \r\n    lack of supporting authority.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity \r\n    and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth \r\n    Carolina law clearly states that short, conclusory statements made without \r\n    supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented \r\n    for review.â€).Â  However, due to the magnitude and consequence of a TPR and \r\n    because a copy of the family courtâ€™s order was located in this courtâ€™s case \r\n    file, we have proceeded to the merits of this appeal.Â  See Joiner \r\n    ex rel. Rivas v.

Allan Hill, of Greenville; for Appellant/Respondent.\r\nWilliam B. Swent, of Greenville; for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â  Patricia Houston \r\n  Messer (â€œWifeâ€) brought this contempt action against her former husband, John \r\n  A. Messer, III (â€œHusbandâ€), to collect alimony payable under a separation agreement \r\n  incorporated into the partiesâ€™ final divorce decree. \r\nAfter multiple hearings, the family court ruled:Â  \r\n  1) income should be imputed to Husband for his voluntary underemployment; 2) \r\n  Husband improperly classified income derived from the sale of his business under \r\n  a covenant not to compete as capital gains, thus shielding the income from the \r\n  alimony formula contained in the agreement; 3) Husband was responsible for Wifeâ€™s \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees; and 4) Wife waived her right to additional alimony for the \r\n  period prior to 1997.Â  Both parties appeal.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWife and Husband were married in 1960 and separated \r\n  in 1982.Â  They had two minor children when they separated, a son, fourteen years \r\n  of age, and a daughter, ten years of age. \r\nThe parties entered into a separation agreement later approved \r\n  and incorporated into the final divorce decree.Â  In pertinent part, the decree \r\n  provided Husband would pay Wife $1,200 per month in alimony and $250 per month \r\n  in child support for each child during their minority.Â  Thereafter, when the \r\n  children graduated from high school, they each had two years in which to begin \r\n  college, during which the child support obligation continued.Â  Once they entered \r\n  college, child support payments for each child decreased to $100 per month and \r\n  ceased once each child had been given the opportunity to complete at least four \r\n  years of college or post-graduate study.\r\nOnce child support payments ceased under the formula \r\n  above, Husbandâ€™s alimony payments became subject to an alimony formula.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to the formula, Husband was to pay thirty percent of the first $85,000 of his \r\n  adjusted gross income, excluding capital gains, and ten percent of his income \r\n  as so defined over $85,000.Â  Furthermore, the formula provides, â€œin no event \r\n  . . . [shall Husband pay] less than Sixteen Thousand ($16,000.00) per year, \r\n  nor more than Twenty Nine Thousand Five Hundred ($29,500.00) Dollars per year.â€ \r\n  [1]   \r\nThe alimony formula contained a second, limiting clause \r\n  (â€œthe seventy-five percent clauseâ€) providing as follows:\r\n\r\nThat because of any future changes in federal tax \r\n  structure or the economic or physical conditions affecting the husband, he, \r\n  at no time, under the payment schedules set forth above, shall pay more than \r\n  Seventy Five (75%) percent of his annual income after Federal and State Taxes, \r\n  FICA deductions, and child support payments are deducted. \r\n\r\nAt the time of separation, Husband was a salaried employee \r\n  in his fatherâ€™s mirror manufacturing company, Messer Mirror, earning $42,000 \r\n  per year.Â  By 1988, through purchase and inheritance of the companyâ€™s stock, \r\n  the Husband controlled the company and owned a fifty-seven percent interest \r\n  in it.Â  In 1988, the Husband sold Messer Mirror to Messer Industries, a newly \r\n  formed company owned by outside interests, under an Asset Purchase Agreement \r\n  for a total acquisition price of $6.5 million.Â  As a part of the purchase agreement, \r\n  Messer Industries agreed to pay Husband $1.5 million as consideration for a \r\n  five-year covenant not to compete.Â  \r\nIn the ensuing years, Husband declared each payment under \r\n  the covenant as capital gain, rather than ordinary income, thereby shielding \r\n  the income from the alimony formula.Â  He also invested his proceeds from the \r\n  sale in investments yielding non-taxable income.Â  Because payments were temporarily \r\n  discontinued during a dispute between Messer Industries and the Husband, he \r\n  will continue to be paid $66,766 per year through 2007. \r\nAfter Husband discontinued child support, \r\n  he ceased making alimony payments because his ordinary income was so low no \r\n  alimony was payable under the seventy-five percent clause.Â  Subsequently, Wife \r\n  filed a petition seeking a rule to show cause, arguing the seventy-five percent \r\n  clause was inapplicable and Husbandâ€™s ordinary income was artificially low. \r\n  Â \r\nHusband moved to dismiss the action because the \r\n  agreement incorporated into the decree contained an arbitration provision.Â  \r\n  The family court dismissed the petition, ruling the action must be arbitrated.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, Wife appealed to this Court, and this Court reversed and remanded, \r\n  ruling the arbitration clause was unenforceable. [2] Â  \r\nUpon remand, the family court:Â  1) ruled Husband was liable \r\n  for unpaid alimony and interest accruing after August 1997; 2) ruled Wife waived \r\n  her claim for alimony for the period prior to August 1997; and 3) awarded Wife \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees. Â Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the family court. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, \r\n  477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Rather, we are mindful that the trial judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  McAlister \r\n  v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, 483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982).\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by ruling Husband violated \r\n  the covenant of good faith and fair dealing?\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by reclassifying \r\n  income derived from the covenant not to compete as ordinary income?\r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the family court err by imputing income to Husband? \r\n   \r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err in its interpretation \r\n  of the seventy-five percent clause?\r\nE.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by awarding \r\n  Wife attorneysâ€™ fees?\r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by ruling Wife \r\n  waived her right to additional alimony under the alimony formula accruing prior \r\n  to 1997?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by ruling Husband violated the covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing?\r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  by ruling he violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by minimizing \r\n  his ordinary income and thus his alimony obligation. \r\n  [3] Â  We agree.\r\nIn the enforcement of an agreement, the \r\n  court does not have the authority to modify terms that are clear and unambiguous \r\n  on their face.Â  Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nAt the time of the decree, Husband was a salaried employee \r\n  in his fatherâ€™s mirror manufacturing company, Messer Mirror, earning $42,000 \r\n  per year.Â  By 1988, through purchase and inheritance of the companyâ€™s stock, \r\n  Husband owned a fifty-seven percent controlling interest in the company.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  Husband sold Messer Mirror to Messer Industries, a newly formed company owned \r\n  by outside interests.Â  As part of the purchase agreement, Messer Industries \r\n  agreed to employ Husband for five years as president at a compensation of $86,000 \r\n  per year, comprised of a salary of $80,000 and a car allowance valued at an \r\n  additional $6,000 per year. \r\nIn 1996, Husbandâ€™s salaried position with Messer Industries \r\n  was terminated.Â  Thereafter, he did not seek another salaried position.Â  Instead, \r\n  Husband started Continental Marketing to market furniture.Â  He organized and \r\n  managed Continentalâ€™s finances to avoid paying ordinary income to himself, where \r\n  possible.Â  Although other members of his family work in the business and receive \r\n  ordinary income, he does not.Â  At the same time, many of his living expenses, \r\n  such as automobile, medical and dental bills, are paid through the company without \r\n  incurring ordinary income subject to the alimony formula. \r\nAs a result of these events, Husband claimed his adjusted \r\n  gross income, excluding capital gains, fell below the minimum amount triggering \r\n  alimony under the alimony formula, thereby eliminating his alimony obligation \r\n  in each subsequent tax year.Â  \r\nIn its final order, the family court acknowledged Husbandâ€™s \r\n  management and tax reporting of Continentalâ€™s finances may be â€œtechnically legal \r\n  and indeed may well constitute wise tax planning.â€Â  Nevertheless, the family \r\n  court ruled Husband voluntarily and purposefully decreased the amount of his \r\n  ordinary income to avoid paying alimony.Â  Thus, the family court held that by \r\n  minimizing his tax consequences in the manner described above, Husband acted \r\n  in bad faith. \r\nWe agree with Husbandâ€™s argument that under the plain terms \r\n  of the agreement and the decree, he has not acted in bad faith by minimizing \r\n  his tax consequences, even though it has the effect of decreasing the Wifeâ€™s \r\n  alimony.Â  The decree specifically bases the alimony formula on the ordinary, \r\n  taxable income of Husband as determined for federal income tax purposes, excluding \r\n  capital gain.Â  This provision is not hidden, implied, or difficult to understand.Â  \r\n  It is expressly stated, and is policed by the Husbandâ€™s certification to the \r\n  Internal Revenue Service as to the correctness of his reporting and by his obligation \r\n  to provide a copy of his returns each year to Wife.Â  Unequivocally, this was \r\n  the bargain Wife made.Â  Therefore, we do not agree with the courtâ€™s finding \r\n  of bad faith where the structure and reporting of income was not found to be \r\n  legally improper. [4] Â  There is nothing in the wording \r\n  of the agreement or the decree requiring Husband to forego tax saving advantages \r\n  merely because they have the effect of decreasing his ordinary income to the \r\n  disadvantage of Wife.Â Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by reclassifying income derived from the \r\n  covenant not to compete as ordinary income?\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred by reclassifying \r\n  income derived from the covenant not to compete as ordinary income subject to \r\n  the alimony formula.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note, the \r\n  family court placed the burden of proving the payments were properly considered \r\n  as capital gains under existing tax law on Husband as the â€œtaxpayer.â€Â  Although \r\n  Husband would have the burden of proof under the tax code, [5]  see General Ins. Agency, Inc. v. \r\n  Commissioner, 401 F.2d 324, 329 (4th Cir. 1968), this is not a tax case.Â  \r\n  Rather, this is an action by Wife asserting Husband has violated the decree.Â  \r\n  Therefore, it is Wifeâ€™s burden to establish facts demonstrating a violation \r\n  of the decree to provide a prima facie case of noncompliance.Â  See Brasington \r\n  v. Shannon, 288 S.C. 183, 184, 341 S.E.2d 130, 131 (1986) (â€œIn a proceeding \r\n  for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the \r\n  existence of the order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance.Â  \r\n  The burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his defense and inability \r\n  to comply with the order.â€)Â  Wife had the burden of establishing a prima facie \r\n  violation of the decree.Â  Thus, we conclude the family court erred by placing \r\n  the burden of proof on the Husband, as it would be under the tax code.Â  Notwithstanding \r\n  this error, we conclude Wife met her burden of proving the Husband improperly \r\n  reported this income as capital gains.\r\nWhen determining the tax consequences of payments \r\n  received under a non-compete covenant, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \r\n  Circuit applies what has been termed the â€œeconomic realityâ€ test.Â  General \r\n  Ins. Agency, 401 F.2d at 329-30.Â  Under this test, a court must:Â Â  (1) look \r\n  to the partiesâ€™ purchase agreement and determine whether they â€œintended to allocate \r\n  a portion of the purchase price to such covenant at the time they executed their \r\n  formal sales agreement;â€ and (2) look to the â€œbusiness realityâ€ of the transaction, \r\n  determining whether the covenant not to compete would have real economic benefit \r\n  to the acquiring entity, indicating its terms were negotiated independently \r\n  of the overall sale price of the company being acquired.Â  If both prongs of \r\n  the test are satisfied, payment for the non-compete covenant must be treated \r\n  as ordinary income for income tax purposes.Â  Id.\r\nThe factors to be considered in the application \r\n  of the economic reality test include:Â  â€œ(a) The grantorâ€™s (i.e., covenantorâ€™s) \r\n  business expertise to compete; (b) the grantorâ€™s intent to compete; (c) the \r\n  grantorâ€™s economic resources; (d) the potential damage to the buyer posed by \r\n  the grantorâ€™s competition; (e) the grantorâ€™s contacts and relationships with \r\n  customers, suppliers, and other business contacts; (f) the duration and geographic \r\n  scope of the covenant; (g) enforceability of the covenant not to compete under \r\n  State law; (h) the age and health of the grantor; (i) whether payments for the \r\n  covenant not to compete are pro rata to the grantorâ€™s stock ownership in the \r\n  company being sold; (j) whether the payments under the covenant not to compete \r\n  cease upon breach of the covenant or upon the death of the grantor; and (k) \r\n  the existence of active negotiations over the terms and value of the covenant \r\n  not to compete.â€Â  Thompson v. Commissioner, 73 T.C.M. (CCH) 3169 (U.S. \r\n  Tax Ct. 1997); see Beaver Bolt, Inc. v. Commissioner, 70 T.C.M. \r\n  (CCH) 1364 (U.S. Tax Ct. 1995).\r\nThe evidence within the record indicates Husband \r\n  and his father created Messer Mirror sometime around 1967, and by 1988, Husband \r\n  was the controlling stockholder and president of Messer Mirror.Â  That same year, \r\n  Messer Industries agreed to purchase Messer Mirror.Â  The agreement contained \r\n  three main documents â€“ the asset purchase agreement, the employment agreement, \r\n  and the covenant not to compete. \r\nÂ The asset purchase agreement provided Messer Industries \r\n  would pay two million dollars, pro-rata, to Messer Mirrorâ€™s stockholders for \r\n  the purchase of Messer Mirror.Â  Additionally, the agreement provided Messer \r\n  Industries would pay 1.5 million dollars solely to Husband for a covenant not \r\n  to compete, the sums being segregated within the document.Â  The asset purchase \r\n  agreement then provided a covenant not to compete, which prohibited Husband \r\n  from engaging in any investment, consulting, or advising of any company engaging \r\n  in business involving mirror and glass production.Â  Furthermore, the covenant \r\n  contained a liquidated damages clause, wherein Husband agreed to pay 1.5 million \r\n  dollars for a breach of the covenant, along with any equitable remedies Messer \r\n  Industries may choose.\r\nThe employment agreement provided Messer Industries would \r\n  employ Husband as president for five years at a salary of $86,000 per year, \r\n  including a car allowance.Â  Additionally, the agreement contained a covenant \r\n  not to compete prohibiting Husband from engaging in or performing any services \r\n  for any company that competed with Messer Industries or any of their subsidiaries.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the agreement contained a damages provision stating breach of the \r\n  agreement permitted Messer Industries to bring a suit in law or equity to recover \r\n  its damages.Â  \r\nHusband also signed an additional document entitled â€œNoncompetition \r\n  Agreement.â€Â  The noncompetition agreement prohibited Husband from engaging or \r\n  assisting another to engage in the business of glass or â€œany business that substantially \r\n  competes with the business of . . . [Messer Industries].â€Â  The agreement also \r\n  provides Husband shall be paid 1.5 million dollars as compensation.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the agreement provides the remedies for its breach are monetary damages, a temporary \r\n  restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, the right \r\n  to withhold future payments under the agreement, or a combination of some or \r\n  all of the above.  [6] Â Â  \r\nViewing this evidence in \r\n  light of the economic realities test, we conclude the family court properly \r\n  reclassified the income derived from the covenant not to compete as ordinary \r\n  income.Â  First, the payments for the covenant not to compete were segregated \r\n  from payment for the stock purchase.Â  Furthermore, and most importantly, only \r\n  Husband received payments for the covenant not to compete.Â  Second, the evidence \r\n  indicates the covenant had a real economic benefit to Messer Industries, reflected \r\n  by the separate, multiple, overlapping covenants, prohibiting different conduct \r\n  by Husband and the amount of the liquidated damages provision found within the \r\n  asset purchase agreement. [7] \r\nLastly, the evidence indicates Husband posed a \r\n  real economic threat to Messer Industries if he chose to compete, as the evidence \r\n  indicates he, along with his father, built Messer Mirror, and, at the time of \r\n  purchase, occupied the positions of president and controlling stockholder.Â  \r\n  He possessed vast knowledge of the market, including customers and suppliers, \r\n  and access to Messer Industries inside information.Â  Furthermore, no evidence \r\n  exists indicating Husbandâ€™s age or health would prevent him from competing.Â Â  \r\n\r\nBased on these facts, we hold the weight of the \r\n  evidence indicates the income derived from the covenant not to compete is ordinary \r\n  income.Â  Thus, we come to the same conclusion as that reached by the family \r\n  court, that the income should be considered ordinary income and not capital \r\n  gain for purposes of calculating alimony under the agreement.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by imputing income to Husband? \r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by imputing \r\n  income to him because:Â  1) as a matter of construction of the decree, the decree \r\n  permitted Husband to cease working entirely; and 2) the amount of income the \r\n  family court imputed to him for his earning capacity was excessive.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Construction of the Decree\r\nHusband argues the family court erred, as a matter of construction \r\n  of the decree, by imputing income to him for purposes of the alimony calculus.Â  \r\n  Husband contends the decree does not require him to work, and thus, imputation \r\n  of income to him impermissibly expands the provisions of the decree.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn support of his position, the Husband cites to \r\n  the unofficially published Ohio Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, case of Mayer \r\n  v. Mayer, 1999 WL 1059674 (Ohio Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  [8] Â  Assuming arguendo the case has any precedential value, we conclude \r\n  the facts of the case are vastly different from those in this case.Â  \r\nIn Mayer, the husband agreed to pay alimony \r\n  based upon 46.5% of his income, with the husband to receive â€œa credit against \r\n  said spousal support obligation in an amount equal to 46.5% of the Wifeâ€™s gross \r\n  income from her employment should she become employed during the time \r\n  that the Husbandâ€™s spousal support obligation is in effect.â€Â  The agreement \r\n  was approved by the court.Â  The husband brought a later action to reduce his \r\n  alimony obligation based on his changed circumstances.Â  Additionally, he argued \r\n  income should be imputed to the wife.Â  The lower court agreed.Â  The Ohio Court \r\n  of Appeals reversed, holding the language â€œshould [wife] become employedâ€ was \r\n  clear, and the lower court had no authority to modify the agreement so as to \r\n  impute income to the wife absent express authority to do so.\r\nIn the present case, no analogous provision exists.Â  \r\n  Though capital gains and non-taxable income are excluded from the formula, there \r\n  is no provision requiring Husband to pay a percentage of his ordinary income \r\n  as alimony â€œshould he become employed.â€Â  To the contrary, Husband had a history \r\n  of stable employment at the time the agreement was reached and approved by the \r\n  court, an underlying fact undoubtedly serving as the foundation for the support \r\n  provisions.Â  Consequently, we hold this case is inapposite.Â  Furthermore, as \r\n  a matter of interpreting the decree, we conclude the family court did not err \r\n  by imputing income to Husband.\r\nGenerally, where an agreement is clear and capable \r\n  of legal construction, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful \r\n  meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the agreement.Â  Bogan \r\n  v. Bogan, 298 S.C. 139, 142, 378 S.E.2d 606, 608 (Ct. App. 1989).Â Â Â  However, \r\n  where an agreement has been merged into a courtâ€™s decree, the decree, to the \r\n  extent possible, should be construed to effect the intent of both the judge \r\n  and the parties.Â  McDuffie v. McDuffie, 308 S.C. 401, 409, 418 S.E.2d \r\n  331, 336 (Ct. App. 1992); see also Ratchford v. Ratchford, 295 \r\n  S.C. 297, 299, 368 S.E.2d 214, 215 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding a court should not \r\n  decide an issue relating to an agreement that has been incorporated into a decree \r\n  as if there were no agreement); Mattox v. Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, 60, 344 \r\n  S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œLikeÂ  any other agreement, when the language \r\n  of a settlement agreement is susceptible of more than one interpretation, it \r\n  is the duty of the court to ascertain the intentions of the parties.â€); Elliot \r\n  v. Elliott, 274 S.C. 224, 226, 262 S.E.2d 413, 414 (1980) (â€œ[T]he contractual \r\n  nature of [the partiesâ€™] agreement was, to some extent, lost when it was incorporated \r\n  into the . . .

Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 340, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 121, 126 (Ct. App. 1995) (quoting 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts \r\n  Â§ 479 (1991)).Â  â€œIn the absence of an express provision in the contract, the \r\n  law will imply an agreement to do those things that according to reason and \r\n  justice should be done to carry out the purpose for which the contract was made.â€Â  \r\n  Columbia East Assocs. v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 299 S.C. 515, 520-521, 386 S.E.2d \r\n  259, 262 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nThough the terms of the decree grant Husband great \r\n  latitude in his choice of employment and provide a standard measure for reporting \r\n  income, Husbandâ€™s right to manipulate his income must be governed by what is \r\n  reasonable in light of the purposes of the agreement and the decree.Â  There \r\n  certainly is no fact in the record to support a conclusion that the parties \r\n  or the court contemplated Husbandâ€™s current financial circumstances, and any \r\n  suggestion that the support provisions in the agreement and decree were intended \r\n  to diminish or extinguish Wifeâ€™s support if Husbandâ€™s wealth increased to the \r\n  point he no longer needed to work is illogical.Â  Simply stated, such a reading \r\n  of the provisions undermines the essential purpose of the agreement.Â  Read as \r\n  a whole, one purpose of the decree was to provide a continuing means of support \r\n  for Wife that kept pace with Husbandâ€™s income.Â  Therefore, we hold the family \r\n  court did not err by ruling income should be imputed to Husband.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Amount of Imputed Income\r\nHusband argues the family court imputed an excessive \r\n  amount of income to him.Â  \r\nIt is well-settled in South Carolina that an award \r\n  of alimony should be based on the payor spouseâ€™s earning potential rather than \r\n  merely his current, reported earnings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(4) \r\n  &amp; -130(C)(6) (Supp. 2002) (requiring the family court to consider â€œthe employment \r\n  history and earning potential of each spouseâ€ and â€œthe current and reasonably \r\n  anticipated earnings of both spouses when awarding alimonyâ€).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  a spouse obligated to pay alimony may not voluntarily or intentionally change \r\n  his employment or economic circumstances so as to curtail his income and thereby \r\n  avoid paying alimony or child support.Â  See Camp v. Camp, 269 \r\n  S.C. 173, 174, 236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977) (holding that the courts â€œwill closely \r\n  scrutinize the facts of any case wherein a husband and father voluntarily changes \r\n  employment so as to lessen his earning capacity and, in turn, his ability to \r\n  pay alimony and child support moniesâ€).\r\nThe family court ruled it was unnecessary to determine the exact amount of income \r\n  to impute to Husband because the combination of his imputed salary and the income \r\n  from the covenant not to compete would exceed $125,000 per year, the amount \r\n  triggering the maximum alimony provision in the formula.Â  In reaching this conclusion, \r\n  the court noted that in 1992, less than $20,000 would need to be imputed, in \r\n  1993 â€“ 1995, no income would need to be imputed, and in more recent years, only \r\n  approximately $60,000 would need to be imputed.Â  \r\nContrary to the family courtâ€™s position, we do \r\n  find it necessary to determine the amount of income to be imputed to Husband \r\n  because, prior to this lawsuit, Messer Industries temporarily discontinued Husbandâ€™s \r\n  payments under the covenant not to compete.Â  Should the same thing occur in \r\n  the future, it is necessary to know the amount of income to be imputed in order \r\n  to properly calculate the alimony payable.\r\nAs the family court noted, Husband had an annual \r\n  salary of $86,000 beginning in 1988 and continuing until 1993.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  he worked for the company until his position was terminated in 1996.Â  We find \r\n  no evidence in the record indicating his income earning potential was impaired \r\n  by age or health.Â  Consequently, we conclude imputing $86,000 per year as salary \r\n  reflects Husbandâ€™s earning potential and should be imputed to him as ordinary \r\n  income for the years following 1996.Â  \r\nThus, we agree with the family courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that Husbandâ€™s ordinary income will trigger the maximum amount of alimony permitted \r\n  under the formula for every year following 1996, so long as Husband continues \r\n  to receive income from the covenant not to compete and has not reached retirement \r\n  age.Â Â Â  Furthermore, we agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that imputation \r\n  of income for Husbandâ€™s voluntary underemployment should cease beginning in \r\n  2007, the year Husband will reach retirement age.\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err in its interpretation of the seventy-five \r\n  percent clause?\r\nNext, Husband argues the family court erred by misconstruing \r\n  the seventy-five percent clause contained in the decree.Â  \r\nGenerally, where an agreement is clear and capable \r\n  of legal construction, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful \r\n  meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the agreement.Â  Bogan, \r\n  298 S.C. at 142, 378 S.E.2d at 608.Â Â Â  However, where an agreement has been \r\n  merged into a courtâ€™s decree, the decree, to the extent possible, should be \r\n  construed to effect the intent of both the judge and the parties.Â  McDuffie, \r\n  308 S.C. at 409, 418 S.E.2d at 336; see also Ratchford, 295 S.C. \r\n  at 299, 368 S.E.2d at 215 (holding a court should not decide an issue relating \r\n  to an agreement that has been incorporated into a decree as if there were no \r\n  agreement); Mattox, 289 S.C. at 60, 344 S.E.2d at 622 (â€œLikeÂ  any other \r\n  agreement, when the language of a settlement agreement is susceptible of more \r\n  than one interpretation, it is the duty of the court to ascertain the intentions \r\n  of the parties.â€); Elliot, 274 S.C. at 226, 262 S.E.2d at 414 (â€œ[T]he \r\n  contractual nature of [the partiesâ€™] agreement was, to some extent, lost when \r\n  it was incorporated into the . . . Family Court Order.â€).\r\nBased on its construction of the alimony formula, \r\n  the family court ruled that regardless of the amount of Husbandâ€™s ordinary income, \r\n  Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation must at least be $16,000.Â  We conclude this interpretation \r\n  renders the seventy-five percent clause meaningless.\r\nThe alimony provisions set alimony at $1,200 per month until \r\n  child support ended.Â  Once child support ended, the alimony formula applied, \r\n  fixing the amount at thirty percent of the first $85,000 of Husbandâ€™s adjusted \r\n  gross income, excluding capital gains, and ten percent of his income over $85,000, \r\n  with a minimum of Sixteen Thousand ($16,000.00) per year and a maximum of Twenty \r\n  Nine Thousand Five Hundred ($29,500.00) Dollars per year.Â  \r\nThe seventy-five percent clause followed these provisions.Â  \r\n  Premised upon the possibility of future changes in Federal Tax structure, or \r\n  economic or physical conditions affecting the husband, it states â€œat no time \r\n  under the payment schedules set forth above, shall [Husband] pay more than Seventy \r\n  Five (75%) percent of his annual income after Federal and State Taxes, FICA \r\n  deductions, and child support payments are deducted.â€\r\nBased upon the language, we conclude the seventy-five \r\n  percent clause applies as a limitation under either of the alimony provisions.Â  \r\n  Therefore, when it is applicable, the seventy-five percent clause overrides \r\n  the minimum $16,000 alimony provision.Â  \r\nWe reach this conclusion for two reasons.Â  First, \r\n  the seventy-five percent clause states that it applies under â€œthe payment schedules,â€ \r\n  thus referring to both the payment schedule in effect when child support is \r\n  paid and the schedule under the alimony formula.Â  Second, the numerator employed \r\n  in the clause is Husbandâ€™s â€œannual income after Federal and State Taxes, FICA \r\n  deductions, and child support payments are deducted.â€Â  There would be no reference \r\n  to the deduction of child support payments if the clause only applied under \r\n  the alimony formula, because payment under the formula only commences after \r\n  child support ceases.Â  Therefore, the Seventy Five (75%) clause provides a limitation \r\n  on the amount of alimony payable under either schedule, thereby overriding the \r\n  stated minimum of $16,000, when it applies.Â  \r\nHowever, by its clear terms, the limitation only applies \r\n  when the alimony obligation exceeds 75% of Husbandâ€™s annual income less stated \r\n  deductions as a result of changes in Federal Tax structure, or economic or physical \r\n  conditions affecting the husband.Â  We agree with Wife that this provision was \r\n  intended to provide protection to Husband in the event of adverse consequences \r\n  from future tax law changes, economic conditions, or physical conditions affecting \r\n  him that are beyond his control.Â  Reading the clause in light of the entire \r\n  agreement, we conclude the clause was not intended to allow Husband to limit \r\n  his alimony obligation by voluntarily lowering his annual income.Â Â Â Â  \r\nNotwithstanding our conclusion the seventy five \r\n  percent clause can operate as a limitation on alimony under the formula, it \r\n  does not aid Husband under the present circumstances for the reason above stated.Â  \r\n  As we have already discussed, income subject to the formula is imputable to \r\n  him in the amount of $86,000 per year based on his underemployment, and to the \r\n  extent it is paid, ordinary income is imputable for the amounts paid under the \r\n  covenant not to compete.Â  These figures provide a combined ordinary income exceeding \r\n  $125,000, the amount triggering the $29,500 maximum alimony.Â  \r\nE.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by awarding Wife attorneysâ€™ fees?\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by awarding \r\n  Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Specifically, Husband contends the family court did not \r\n  substantiate its award by requiring the production of detailed time sheets and \r\n  other documentation.Â  This argument is without merit.\r\nThe family court is authorized by statute to award \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees in conjunction with marital litigation.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(2) (Supp. 2002).Â  In determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the \r\n  case, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, \r\n  the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary \r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, \r\n  161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nIn this case, the family court analyzed \r\n  each of the factors outlined above and detailed its findings in its final order.Â  \r\n  Its findings are further supported by the affidavits of Wifeâ€™s counsel submitted \r\n  to the family court and contained in the record before us. \r\nAccordingly, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by ruling Wife \r\n  waived her right to additional alimony under the alimony formula accruing prior \r\n  to 1997?\r\nWife argues the family court erred by \r\n  ruling she and Husband orally modified the decree.Â  We agree.\r\nIn pertinent part, the decree provided that once the \r\n  children were emancipated, Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation was subject to a calculus.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the decree provided, â€œno modification nor waiver of any of the \r\n  terms hereof shall be valid unless in writing and signed by both parties.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAccording to the unappealed finding of the family court, \r\n  by November of 1991, both children were emancipated.Â  The evidence indicates \r\n  that subsequently, Wife demanded Husband begin paying alimony as calculated \r\n  under the alimony formula.Â  However, Husband refused, and Wife orally agreed \r\n  to allow Husband to pay less than the decree required.Â  Thereafter, in 1997, \r\n  Husband discontinued paying alimony altogether, and Wife brought this suit. \r\n\r\nBased on this evidence, the family court \r\n  ruled Wifeâ€™s oral consent to an alteration of the alimony agreement was sufficient \r\n  to modify the provisions of the alimony formula.Â  Consequently, the family court \r\n  held Wife waived her right to the alimony payments required by the formula for \r\n  the period prior to 1997. \r\nAlthough we agree that generally a written \r\n  contract may be orally modified, notwithstanding a provision in the contract \r\n  barring oral modification, [9]  \r\n  where, as here, a contract has been merged into a court order, and the order \r\n  contains a provision barring oral modification, any oral modification is unenforceable.Â Â Â  \r\n  See Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 519, 586 S.E.2d 136, 140 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (â€œ[I]t is axiomatic that parties cannot modify a court order.â€).Â  \r\n  Therefore, we hold the family court erred by ruling the decree was orally modified.Â  \r\n  Thus, we remand this matter to the family court for a determination of the amount \r\n  of past due alimony owed to Wife. [10]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the \r\n  family courtâ€™s determination that income should be imputed to the Husband both \r\n  for his underemployment and for his allocation of payments received under the \r\n  covenant not to compete as capital gain.Â  Additionally, we AFFIRM the \r\n  award of attorneysâ€™ fees to Wife.\r\nWe REVERSE the order of the family court, imputing \r\n  income to the Husband based on bad faith in the management of his new corporation \r\n  and interpreting the seventy-five percent clause to apply only to the stated \r\n  maximum amount of alimony payable under the alimony formula.Â  Furthermore, we \r\n  REVERSE the family courtâ€™s determination that Wife, by oral modification, \r\n  waived her right to additional alimony accruing prior to 1997.\r\nLastly, we REMAND to the family court to hold a hearing, \r\n  and to take such additional testimony as may be necessary, to determine the \r\n  past and future alimony payments due from Husband to Wife in accordance with \r\n  the order of the family court as modified by this opinion.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Thus, any amount exceeding $125,000 cannot be subject to the alimony \r\n    formula, as ordinary income of $125,000 will trigger the maximum alimony provision \r\n    contained within this clause.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Ex Parte Messer, 333 S.C. 391, 509 S.E.2d \r\n    486 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The family court applied the contractual doctrine of good faith and \r\n    fair dealing to the provisions of the decree.Â  Neither party has argued the \r\n    family court erred in this respect.Â  Thus, this is the law of the case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  To the extent the family court ruled Husband acted in bad faith by \r\n    transferring income-producing assets to his new Wife, Husband has not appealed \r\n    this issue.Â  Thus, it is the law of the case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The tax courtâ€™s degree of scrutiny depends on the nature of the relationship \r\n    between the parties to the business asset sales agreement.Â  Where the parties \r\n    do not have tax consequences adverse to each other in the transaction, the \r\n    tax court strictly scrutinizes an allocation of the purchase price in a business \r\n    asset sale. Bemidji Distributing Co., Inc. v. Commissioner, 82 T.C.M \r\n    (CCH) 677 (U.S. Tax Ct. 2001). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  We note, the covenant not to compete provides the payments to Husband \r\n    continue even if he dies prior to the expiration of the five-year life of \r\n    the covenant.Â  Husband argues this fact weighs in favor of classifying the \r\n    covenantâ€™s income as capital gain.Â  However, the covenant also provides payments \r\n    will cease upon a breach, a fact weighing in favor of classifying the income \r\n    as ordinary.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Husband contends the document entitled, â€œNoncompetition Agreementâ€ \r\n    had no real economic benefit to Messer Industries, as Husband was already \r\n    bound by covenants not to compete in both his employment agreement and the \r\n    asset purchase agreement.Â  However, we find this argument unconvincing, as \r\n    the covenants not to compete found in the employment agreement and the asset \r\n    purchase agreement prohibit different conduct by Husband and provide different \r\n    remedies for their breach.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Rule 2, Ohio Supreme Court Rules for the Reporting of Opinions, provides \r\n    in part that unofficially published and unpublished opinions of the Courts \r\n    of Appeals may be cited by any court or person as â€œpersuasiveâ€ authority on \r\n    a court, including the deciding court, in the judicial district in which the \r\n    opinion was rendered.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  See Sanchez v. Tilley, 285 S.C. 449, 452, 330 S.E.2d \r\n    319, 320 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [10] At trial, Husband argued, as additional equitable defenses, Wifeâ€™s claim \r\n    for additional alimony prior to 1997 was barred by both laches and estoppel.Â  \r\n    Disposing of these claims, the family court ruled neither of the doctrines \r\n    applied to the facts of this case.Â  Husband has not appealed that ruling.Â  \r\n    Thus, it is law of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3826","title":"State v.

Â Shannon Hillâ€™s (no relation) testimony \r\n  essentially mirrored Greenâ€™s, but she remembered approximately five shots.Â  \r\n  A third witness, Michelle Clinkscales, testified she was standing nearby when \r\n  she heard shots.Â  After a pause, she heard more shots and saw Hill ride away \r\n  on his bike. Â The fourth witness, Jeffrey Tatum, testified he had been \r\n  riding in the car with Victim for over an hour when they arrived at the apartment \r\n  complex where the shooting occurred.Â  Tatum said when they stopped in the parking \r\n  lot, he and another friend got out of the car. Â He explained Hill arrived \r\n  on his bike, said, â€œhey, I heard you was looking for me,â€ got off his bike, \r\n  walked toward the car, and started shooting Victim.Â  Tatum testified Victim \r\n  had a stick in the car, but never attempted to use it.Â  \r\nHill also testified, admitting to shooting Victim but claiming he did so in \r\n  self-defense.Â  When asked why he thought it was self-defense, he said, â€œthis \r\n  right here has been going on for a long time.Â  More than one occasion Artie \r\n  put sticks and baseball bats at me trying to take my life . . . .â€ Â Specifically \r\n  regarding this incident, Hill stated Victim yelled something out of the window \r\n  as Hill rode up on his bike.Â  He then saw Victim had a stick beside him and \r\n  was reaching for the door.Â  Hill testified that he was then scared for his life \r\n  and â€œran up to the car to defendâ€ himself. Â Victim suffered six gunshot \r\n  wounds, including four to the head.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\nHill argues the trial court erred by allowing the State to comment on his post-arrest \r\n  silence in violation of the Due Process Clause and Doyle v. Ohio, 426 \r\n  U.S. 610 (1976).Â  The State counters that Hill opened the door to the questions \r\n  and, alternatively, that any error was harmless.Â  We agree with Hill.\r\nHill surrendered shortly after the shooting and was later taken to jail. Â Sergeant \r\n  Terrance Harvard, the investigator in charge, testified he saw Hill in jail \r\n  about an hour after the shooting.Â  Hill signed a pre-printed voluntary statement \r\n  form indicating he had been warned of his rights, including his right to remain \r\n  silent.Â  In the space designed for a statement, Hill signed his name and wrote, \r\n  â€œI do not want to make a statement.â€Â  This form was marked as a court exhibit \r\n  at trial. Â \r\nSergeant Harvard did not testify \r\n  to any conversation he had with Hill.Â  The questioning Hill challenges occurred \r\n  during his own testimony.Â  When cross-examined about what he did after the shooting, \r\n  Hill said, â€œ[t]hatâ€™s when I went and turned myself in so I could come here today \r\n  to prove my innocence, that it was self-defense.Â  Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t write \r\n  a statement or no report on everything that happened.â€ Â Hill repeated \r\n  this claim again and later added, â€œI told everybody it was self-defense.â€Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, the solicitor \r\n  asked the following question:Â  \r\n\r\n  SOLICITOR:Â  You didnâ€™t tell Terry Harvard that night it was self-defense, \r\n    did you?\r\n\r\nHillâ€™s counsel immediately objected \r\n  and moved for a mistrial.Â  The objection was overruled.Â  After a second inquiry \r\n  about whether he had told anyone the shooting was self-defense prior to testifying \r\n  at trial, defense counsel objected again, and the objection was again overruled.Â  \r\n  When Hill volunteered he had told his attorney and the State asked when \r\n  he first met with his attorney, the trial court sustained defense counselâ€™s \r\n  objection but denied his mistrial motion.Â  \r\nIn Doyle v. Ohio, the United States Supreme Court held a state prosecutor \r\n  violates a defendantâ€™s due process rights by impeaching his exculpatory story, \r\n  told for the first time at trial, through cross-examination regarding his post-arrest \r\n  silence.Â  Doyle, 426 U.S. at 611.Â  The court reasoned that because Miranda \r\n  [1]  warnings implicitly assure that silence will carry no penalty, â€œit \r\n  would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the \r\n  arrested personâ€™s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently \r\n  offered at trial.â€Â  Id. at 618.Â  Relying on Doyle, our supreme \r\n  court held â€œthe State may neither comment upon nor present evidence at trial \r\n  of a defendantâ€™s decision to exercise his right to remain silent or be represented \r\n  by an attorney.â€Â  Edmond v. State, 341 S.C. 340, 345, 534 S.E.2d 682, \r\n  685 (2000).Â  \r\nAs an exception to the general rule, â€œthe State may cross-examine a defendant \r\n  about his post-arrest, post-Miranda silence when he offers an exculpatory \r\n  story at trial and claims he told police the same version upon arrest.â€Â  State \r\n  v. McIntosh, ___ S.C. ___, ___, 595 S.E.2d 484, 489 (2004).Â  However, such \r\n  is not the case here as Hill did not claim he told police the shooting was in \r\n  self-defense.Â  Here, the State clearly questioned Hill on his post-arrest, post-Miranda \r\n  silence in violation of Doyle.Â  \r\nThe State contends any Doyle violation in this case was invited by Hillâ€™s \r\n  testimony and even if error, was harmless.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur supreme court recently addressed the question of whether a defendant opened \r\n  the door to a Doyle violation in McIntosh.Â  In that case, the \r\n  State asserted the defendantâ€™s testimony created an appearance that he fully \r\n  cooperated with law enforcement, thus opening the door to questions about whether \r\n  he shared his exculpatory story with police at the time of his arrest.Â  McIntosh, \r\n  ___ S.C. at ___, 595 S.E.2d at 490-91.Â  McIntosh testified he voluntarily returned \r\n  to South Carolina upon learning authorities were looking for him but said he \r\n  did not give them a statement.Â  He explained he would have been talking to police \r\n  if he knew anything about the crimes.Â  Our supreme court held McIntosh did not, \r\n  â€œexplicitly or implicitly, assert he cooperated with police.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  ___, 595 S.E.2d at 491.Â  Instead, the court noted the focus of his defense was \r\n  that he knew nothing about the crimes and thus had nothing to tell police.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Like McIntosh, Hill explained he turned himself in to authorities \r\n  and did not give a statement.Â  Hill claimed he surrendered so he could prove \r\n  self-defense in court.Â  This testimony did not amount to an assertion that he \r\n  cooperated with authorities and did not invite the State to challenge his self-defense \r\n  explanation by questioning him on his exercise of his right to remain silent.\r\nNor was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  For a Doyle violation \r\n  to be harmless, the record must establish:Â  \r\n\r\n  that the reference to silence be a single reference; that the single reference \r\n    never be repeated or alluded to in either the trial or in jury argument; that \r\n    the prosecutor does not directly tie the defendantâ€™s silence to his exculpatory \r\n    story; that the exculpatory story be totally implausible, transparently frivolous; \r\n    and that evidence of guilt be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nState v. Truesdale, 285 S.C. 13, 18-19, 328 S.E.2d 53, 56 (1984).Â  Although \r\n  there is an argument that many of these factors are present, the State directly \r\n  tied Hillâ€™s silence to this exculpatory story.Â  In essence, the prosecution \r\n  attempted to show had Hill acted in self-defense he would have immediately explained \r\n  this to authorities.Â  Because the State directly tied Hillâ€™s silence to his \r\n  defense, the error cannot be harmless.Â  We therefore reverse Hillâ€™s convictions \r\n  and remand for a new trial.

Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, \r\n550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).&nbsp; \r\nWoodrow claims the trial court incorrectly applied the public duty rule \r\nwithout first determining whether the officer properly exercised his discretion \r\nunder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 2003).&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nWoodrowâ€™s complaint alleges general acts of negligence without basing those \r\nallegations on any specific statutory authority.&nbsp; Rather, he claims only \r\ngenerally that the town violated state statutes and common law.&nbsp; The trial \r\ncourt granted summary judgment based upon the public duty rule.&nbsp; The public \r\nduty rule is only implicated when a plaintiff relies upon a statute as creating \r\na duty.&nbsp; See Trousdell v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 641, 572 \r\nS.E.2d 264, 266-267 (2002); Arthurs v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97, 103, \r\n551 S.E.2d 579, 582 (2001) (holding when and only when the plaintiff relies upon \r\na statute as creating the duty does the public duty rule come into play).&nbsp; \r\nUnder the public duty rule, a statute prescribing the duties of a public officer \r\ndoes not, without more, impose on him a duty of care toward individual members \r\nof the public in the performance of his duties.&nbsp; See Rayfield v. \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 297 S.C. 95, 105, 374 S.E.2d 910, 915-16 (Ct. \r\nApp. 1988).&nbsp; \r\nTo the extent Woodrow relies on violations of a statute or statutes, we agree \r\nwith the trial court his claims are barred by the public duty rule.&nbsp; We \r\nnote the code sections corresponding to Woodrowâ€™s claims merely recite in broad \r\nterms when circumstances make it unlawful to operate a motor vehicle, procedures \r\nsurrounding incidents of possible DUI or, as in the case of the latter section, \r\nthe general licensing requirement for motorists.&nbsp; None of the statutes \r\nimplicated by Woodrowâ€™s claims identify any particular class of victims or any \r\nparticular harm that would create a special duty exception to the general \r\nrule.&nbsp; See Rayfield, 297 S.C. at 106, 374 S.E.2d at \r\n916.&nbsp; See also Jensen v. Anderson County Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\nServs., 304 S.C. 195, 200, 403 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1991) (wherein the supreme \r\ncourt adopted this courtâ€™s six step special duty analysis as an exception to the \r\npublic duty rule).&nbsp; We conclude the duty, if any, created by the statutes \r\nin question is owed to the public at large and not to Woodrow \r\nindividually.&nbsp; \r\nWoodrowâ€™s complaint also included negligence claims based on Officer McKeeâ€™s \r\ndecision to choose Joseph as the replacement driver and alleged failure by the \r\ntown to properly train and supervise its police officers.&nbsp; Neither of these \r\nclaims is based on statutory duties.&nbsp; Therefore, they are not barred by the \r\npublic duty rule. &nbsp;See Arthurs, 346 S.C. at 103, 551 S.E.2d \r\nat 582 (2001).&nbsp; However, the town raised the affirmative defense of \r\nimmunity based upon the tort claims act and in particular S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ \r\n15-78-60(4), (5), (20), (25) (Supp. 2003) in its motion for summary \r\njudgment.&nbsp; We agree that Woodrowâ€™s remaining claims are barred by the \r\nact. [2] &nbsp; \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 carves out exceptions to the limited waiver of \r\ngovernmental immunity established by the tort claims act, including \r\ndiscretionary immunity that arises when a government employeeâ€™s decision is \r\nwithin the discretion or judgment allowed.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n15-78-60(5) (Supp. 2003).&nbsp; Officer McKee was faced with the choice of \r\nissuing a DUI citation, requiring the passengers to find another way home and \r\nhave the car towed, or selecting another driver after determining whether that \r\nindividual was fit to drive.&nbsp; He chose Joseph to drive after he volunteered \r\nand satisfactorily completed field sobriety tests.&nbsp; Woodrow admitted in his \r\naffidavit that Joseph was in a better condition to drive than he.&nbsp; The \r\nother passenger expressly refused to drive.&nbsp; \r\nMajor Neil Baxley, a police-training instructor, stated in his affidavit that \r\nOfficer McKee operated pursuant to accepted practices of law enforcement in \r\nSouth Carolina and was not required to arrest Felder.&nbsp; Major Baxley opined \r\nOfficer McKee was entitled to use his discretion to best remedy the \r\nsituation.&nbsp; Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Woodrow, we \r\nfind Officer McKeeâ€™s selection of Joseph was a considered, discretionary \r\njudgment.&nbsp; As such, the town is immune to Woodrowâ€™s negligence claim under \r\nsection 15-78-60(5) of the tort claims act.&nbsp; See Clark&nbsp;v. \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 353 S.C. 291, 304, 578 S.E.2d 16, 22 \r\n(Ct. App. 2002) (stating the requirements necessary to establish discretionary \r\nimmunity under the tort claims act).&nbsp; \r\nFinally, Woodrow alleges the town failed to properly train and supervise its \r\npolice officers.&nbsp; There is no evidence in the record to support this claim \r\nbeyond Woodrowâ€™s allegations in his affidavit that, in his opinion, Officer \r\nMcKee was not following standard law enforcement procedures when he made the \r\ndiscretionary judgment to allow Joseph to drive instead of arresting Felder and \r\nimpounding the car.&nbsp; As we have already determined that the officerâ€™s \r\ndecision met the requirements to establish discretionary immunity under the tort \r\nclaims act, we conclude the town is likewise immune from this claim pursuant to \r\nsection 15-78-60(5).&nbsp; \r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp; \r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] &nbsp;We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to \r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n[2] &nbsp;Though we recognize the trial courtâ€™s order was silent \r\non this issue, on appeal this court may affirm on any ground contained in the \r\nrecord.&nbsp; See Rule 220(c), SCACR.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3828","title":"State v.

Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.: Damico S. Flowers appeals his convictions \r\n  for trafficking in cocaine; possession with intent to distribute cocaine near \r\n  a school, park or playground; trafficking in crack cocaine; possession with \r\n  intent to distribute crack cocaine near a school, park or playground; possession \r\n  of marijuana with intent to distribute; possession of marijuana near a school, \r\n  park or playground; possession of a pistol by a person under twenty-one years \r\n  of age; and possession of a pistol during the commission of a violent crime.Â  \r\n  He argues the circuit court erred by admitting evidence obtained pursuant to \r\n  a warrantless search of his girlfriendâ€™s residence, when he had previously denied \r\n  officersâ€™ request to enter the residence.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn August 14, 2001, Officer Phillip Kirkland and Sergeant Delmar Johnson went \r\n  to 1918 Graham Street to investigate a complaint of drug activity and shots \r\n  being fired in the yard.Â  The officers knocked on the door and identified themselves \r\n  as police.Â  A male voice from inside the home told the officers to come in.Â  \r\n  As they stepped into the entryway of the home, Flowers jumped up and told the \r\n  officers to step back outside onto the porch.Â  The officers complied and Flowers \r\n  followed them out, closing the door behind him.Â  Flowers told the officers he \r\n  did not own the residence but the owner would be returning soon.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, the owner of the residence, Latonya Simmons, arrived in \r\n  her vehicle.Â  Sergeant Johnson approached Simmons while Officer Kirkland remained \r\n  with Flowers.Â  According to Sergeant Johnson, he asked Simmons if any drugs \r\n  were in the residence, and she indicated there were.Â  Sergeant Johnson then \r\n  asked Simmons if he could search the house.Â  With Simmonsâ€™ consent, Sergeant \r\n  Johnson and Simmons entered the residence.Â  \r\nInside the home, Sergeant Johnson saw bags of marijuana and crack cocaine lying \r\n  on a speaker in plain view.Â  Additionally, he saw a gun lying on a nearby table.Â  \r\n  Both Simmons and Flowers were taken into custody.Â  Simmons then signed a consent \r\n  to search form. A further search of the residence revealed more illegal drugs.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, Flowers confessed that all of the contraband belonged to him.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, Flowers moved to suppress the drug evidence, arguing it was obtained \r\n  pursuant to a warrantless search of his girlfriendâ€™s residence over his objections.Â  \r\n  Flowers claimed he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the residence, \r\n  requiring the officers to heed his refusal to allow a search, notwithstanding \r\n  Simmonsâ€™ later consent.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, finding although \r\n  Flowers had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the residence, his statements \r\n  to the police indicating he did not own the house and the owner would return \r\n  shortly limited his authority to the time until the owner returned.Â  The circuit \r\n  court found Flowers did not have standing to challenge Simmonsâ€™ consent to search \r\n  the residence. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFlowers argues the circuit court erred by admitting evidence obtained pursuant \r\nto a warrantless search of his girlfriendâ€™s residence, when he had previously \r\ndenied officersâ€™ request to enter the residence. [2]   \r\nâ€œ[T]he appellate standard of review in Fourth Amendment \r\n  search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s finding and the appellate court may only reverse where there \r\n  is clear error.â€Â  State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 219 n.3, 532 S.E.2d 896, \r\n  898 n.3 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 528 S.E.2d \r\n  661 (2000)).\r\nEvidence obtained as a result \r\n  of an unlawful search constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment and is \r\n  inadmissible at trial.Â  State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 192 n.3, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  786, 789 n.3 (1999).Â  When a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy \r\n  in the property being searched, Fourth Amendment rights apply to the search.Â  \r\n  Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 95-96 (1990).Â  A reasonable expectation \r\n  of privacy exists when the defendant has a relationship with the property or \r\n  property owner.Â  State v. Missouri, 352 S.C. 121, 129, 572 S.E.2d 467, \r\n  470-471 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Although a person present only intermittently or for \r\n  a purely commercial purpose does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, \r\n  an overnight guest may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the hostâ€™s \r\n  property.Â  Olson, 495 U.S. at 98-99.\r\nThird party consent may be given by one who has common authority \r\n  over or some other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects being \r\n  searched.Â  State v. Moultrie, 271 S.C. 526, 528, 248 S.E.2d 486, 487 \r\n  (1978) (citing United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 94 S. Ct. 988 \r\n  (1974)). Common authority does not require common ownership, but merely â€œâ€˜mutual \r\n  use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for \r\n  most purposes, so that it is reasonableâ€™ for the searching officers to believe \r\n  that the person granting consent had the authority to do so.â€Â  Moultrie, \r\n  271 S.C. at 528, 248 S.E.2d at 487 (quoting Matlock, 415 U.S. at 171 \r\n  n.7).Â  However, a homeowner may grant consent to search the premises on which \r\n  a criminal defendant resides if the homeowner possesses common authority over \r\n  or sufficient relationship to the premises or effects to be inspected.Â  State \r\n  v. Pressley, 288 S.C. 128, 130, 341 S.E.2d 626, 627 (1986). \r\nThe circuit court found Flowers had a legitimate expectation of privacy in \r\nSimmonsâ€™ residence.Â  Flowers and Simmons both testified Flowers spent approximately \r\nfive nights a week at Simmonsâ€™ home, kept a change of clothing there, and occasionally \r\npaid the rent.Â  This evidence is sufficient to conclude that Flowers and Simmons \r\nhad common authority over the residence, and to support the circuit courtâ€™s finding \r\nthat Flowers had a reasonable expectation of privacy in Simmonsâ€™ residence. \r\nFlowers argues because he had previously denied the officersâ€™ \r\n  request to search, Simmons did not have authority to subsequently consent to \r\n  a search.Â  However, Flowers provides no authority for the proposition that a \r\n  guestâ€™s refusal to consent to a search deprives a homeowner of the right to \r\n  subsequently grant consent.Â  To the contrary, a homeowner does not relinquish \r\n  control over the premises to a third party simply because the third party occasionally \r\n  resides in the home.Â  Pressley, 288 S.C. at 130, 341 S.E.2d at 627; see \r\n  also State v.

Perry appeals her \r\n  conviction for homicide by child abuse in connection with the death of her nine-month-old \r\n  son Jaquan.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nOn September 21, 2000, about 1:15 p.m., Perry and her boyfriend Henry Fletcher \r\n  brought Jaquan to the pediatric intensive care unit at Richland Memorial Hospital.Â  \r\n  When they arrived, Jaquan was in full cardiopulmonary arrest, and the emergency \r\n  room staff began resuscitation efforts.Â  When Robert Hubbird, a pediatric \r\n  intensive care physician at the hospital arrived at the unit, Jaquanâ€™s pulse \r\n  had just been restored after about twenty-five minutes of resuscitation.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  because a significant amount of time had passed since Jaquan collapsed during \r\n  which no one administered CPR, he quit breathing and lost his pulse again, \r\n  requiring multiple resuscitations.Â  Eventually, having determined that \r\n  these measures were ineffective, Hubbird ordered the staff to discontinue further \r\n  attempts to save Jaquan, and the child was pronounced dead at 4:20 p.m.\r\nJaquanâ€™s injuries included multiple rib fractures, injury to the liver, \r\n  and severe damage to the large and small bowels.Â  The injuries indicated \r\n  non-accidental trauma. \r\nOn December 13, 2000, the Richland County grand jury indicted Perry and Fletcher \r\n  for homicide by child abuse in connection with Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  The defendants \r\n  were tried together in February 2002.Â  The jury found both Perry and \r\n  Fletcher guilty, and the trial court sentenced them each to life imprisonment.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n \r\n On appeal, Perry contends the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce \r\n  evidence that she failed to show remorse for Jaquanâ€™s death both before and \r\n  after her arrest.Â  She argues this evidence was inadmissible as an infringement \r\n  on her constitutional rights. [2] \r\n  Â  We hold Perry did not preserve this argument for appeal.Â \r\nâ€œThe state may not directly or indirectly comment on the defendantâ€™s right \r\n  to remain silent.â€ [3] Â Â  â€œReferences to a defendantâ€™s lack of remorse are . . . improper \r\n  as violative of a defendantâ€™s Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.â€ [4] Â  Such rules are â€œrooted in due \r\n  process and the belief that justice is best served when a trial is fundamentally \r\n  fair.â€ [5] &nbsp;\r\n Hubbird testified that, when he informed Perry that Jaquan had died, she displayed \r\n  â€œan incredibly flat affect,â€ showing no emotion and appearing uninterested.Â  \r\n  Hubbird went on to testify that he found Perryâ€™s behavior unusual because, \r\n  at other times when he delivered bad news, the recipient would usually ask many \r\n  questions and show intense emotion.Â  Furthermore, Crolos Jenkins, an \r\n  acquaintance of Perry, testified he was the only one at the hospital who was \r\n  upset about Jaquan and that Perry and her family were acting â€œlike it was a \r\n  family reunion up there.â€Â  In addition, the police officer who questioned \r\n  Perry testified that she was not particularly upset on the day Jaquan died and \r\n  did not show any remorse.\r\nPerry objected to these statements only on the basis of relevance. \r\n  [6] Â  This objection would not encompass the argument that the admission \r\n  of such evidence amounted to a deprivation of due process.Â  \r\nRule 402 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provides in pertinent part \r\n  that â€œ[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided \r\n  by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State \r\n  of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, or by other rules promulgated by the \r\n  Supreme Court of South Carolina.â€ [7] Â  Under the clear language of this rule, the \r\n  exclusion of evidence on a constitutional ground is an exception to the principle \r\n  that relevant evidence must be admitted.Â  Here, the trial court, in overruling \r\n  Perryâ€™s objection that the evidence was not relevant, made no determination \r\n  as to whether it was constitutionally impermissible.Â  It was therefore incumbent \r\n  on Perry, in objecting to the admission of evidence about her lack of remorse, \r\n  to raise the issue of due process to the trial court in order to preserve this \r\n  objection for direct appeal.Â Â Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Because oral argument \r\n    would not aid the court in resolving the issue on appeal, we decide this case \r\n    without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Perry cites the following \r\n    authorities in support of her argument:Â  Doyle v.

[1] Â  At some point during the armed \r\n  robbery investigation, Robinson was informed that he was also a suspect in an \r\n  unsolved murder.Â Â  Robinson, who had agreed to cooperate with law enforcement \r\n  concerning the armed robbery, led police to the area where the gun used in the \r\n  robbery was discarded.Â  The police found the weapon with Robinsonâ€™s assistance.Â  \r\n  While returning to the police station, a handcuffed Robinson successfully fled \r\n  from the police vehicle while it was slowing for a traffic light.Â  He was apprehended \r\n  and arrested five days later at a nearby residence wearing a wig, a dress, lipstick, \r\n  and high-heeled shoes and hiding under several mattresses.Â  Robinson, Atkins, \r\n  and Epps were indicted for armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the \r\n  commission of a crime, and conspiracy.Â  \r\nIn the first trial against Robinson, following approximately two days of testimony, \r\n  jury deliberations began on the third day at 9:54 a.m..Â  The trial judge recharged \r\n  the jury in response to the juryâ€™s requests, and witness testimony was replayed.Â  \r\n  At 4:03 p.m., the jury sent a note to the judge stating it had not come to a \r\n  unanimous decision on the first and second charge (armed robbery and conspiracy), \r\n  but had agreed on a verdict as to the third charge (possession of a firearm).Â  \r\n  Over Robinsonâ€™s objection, the judge charged the jury pursuant to Allen v. \r\n  United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).Â  \r\nAt 5:32 p.m., the jury sent the judge another note indicating that it remained \r\n  deadlocked on the two undecided charges and inquiring into court policies regarding \r\n  the jurorsâ€™ personal responsibilities, such as picking up their children.Â  The \r\n  judge responded by allowing any juror who needed to make alternative personal \r\n  arrangements access to a telephone.Â  The judge also explained that law enforcement \r\n  officers would aid any juror who needed assistance with transportation or otherwise.Â  \r\n  As to the juryâ€™s deadlock status, the judge expressed his desire that the deliberations \r\n  continue until a verdict was reached, but requested the jury determine if more \r\n  time would be beneficial in pursuit of a unanimous verdict.Â Â Â  \r\nSix minutes after giving this direction, the judge \r\n  received a final note from the jury, which stated:\r\n\r\n  We feel that further deliberation would not make a difference.Â  We do appreciate \r\n    your patience, but we canâ€™t reach a decision on the 1st and 2nd \r\n    charges.\r\n\r\nThe judge summoned the jury into the courtroom where \r\n  a verdict of not guilty was published as to the charge of possession of a firearm \r\n  during the commission of a crime.Â  Over Robinsonâ€™s objection, the judge then \r\n  declared a mistrial in regard to the two undecided charges.Â  \r\nOver Robinsonâ€™s renewed objection and motion to dismiss, Robinson was retried \r\n  on the two remaining charges.Â  The jury found Robinson not guilty of conspiracy, \r\n  but guilty of armed robbery.Â  He appeals from his armed robbery conviction and \r\n  sentence.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err in denying Robinsonâ€™s motion to dismiss \r\n      based on the Double Jeopardy Clause?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in allowing evidence of Robinsonâ€™s \r\n      flight from law enforcement?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to \r\n  review errors of law only.Â  State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d \r\n  61, 65 (1973).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they \r\n  are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 \r\n  S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  Concerning the admission of evidence, the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  determination will be sustained absent error and resulting prejudice.Â  State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 353, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Mistrial\r\nRobinson argues the declaration of mistrial in his initial trial was in error, \r\n  thereby precluding the subsequent trial.Â  Specifically, Robinson argues the \r\n  retrial violated the United States and South Carolina Constitutionsâ€™ Double \r\n  Jeopardy Clauses.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions \r\n  are in accord.Â  The federal constitution provides that â€œ[n]o person shallÂ  . \r\n  . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb \r\n  . . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. V.Â  The South Carolina counterpart similarly provides \r\n  that â€œ[n]o person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy \r\n  of life or liberty . . . .â€Â  S. C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12.Â  See State \r\n  v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 132, 489 S.E.2d 617, 623 (1997) (â€œArticle I, section \r\n  12 of the S.C. Constitution is essentially identical to the Fifth Amendment \r\n  and, on its face, confers no greater rights than the federal constitution.â€); \r\n  see also Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969) (holding \r\n  the United States Constitutionâ€™s Double Jeopardy Clause is applicable to the \r\n  states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).Â  Pursuant \r\n  to this clause, a defendant, such as Robinson, is protected from multiple prosecutions \r\n  for the same offense after an improvidently granted mistrial. \r\n  [2] Â  State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 27-28, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977); \r\n  State v. Baum, 355 S.C. 209, 214, 584 S.E.2d 419, 421 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n  If, in a criminal trial, a mistrial is declared â€œwithout an absolute necessity \r\n  for it, the [mistrial] is equivalent to an acquittal, and may be pleaded as \r\n  a bar to a subsequent indictment.â€Â  State v. Bilton, 156 S.C. 324, 342, \r\n  153 S.E. 269, 276 (1930) (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  We must, therefore, \r\n  determine the propriety of the trial courtâ€™s initial declaration of mistrial.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the trial court properly declared a mistrial.Â  It is universally recognized \r\n  that a genuine inability of the jury to reach a unanimous verdict constitutes \r\n  a manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial.Â  21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal \r\n  Law Â§ 402 (2003).Â  â€œ[A] mistrial declared by the judge following the juryâ€™s \r\n  declaration that it was unable to reach a verdict . . . remains the prototypical \r\n  example [of] . . . â€˜manifest necessity.â€™â€Â  Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. \r\n  667, 672 (1982).Â  The trial judge, however, has a duty to urge the jury to reach \r\n  a verdict, provided he does not coerce them.Â  State v. Williams, 344 \r\n  S.C. 260, 263-64, 543 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The typical judicial \r\n  mechanism for encouraging an indecisive jury is the Allen charge, in \r\n  which jurors are instructed on, among other things, their duties to approach \r\n  the evidence with an open mind and consider the opinions of their fellow jurors. \r\n  [3] Â  If a jury, following additional deliberations in the wake of an Allen \r\n  charge, remains deadlocked, section 14-7-1330 of the South Carolina Code of \r\n  Laws is triggered.Â  The statute reads, in pertinent part, â€œ[b]ut if [the jury] \r\n  returns a second time without having agreed upon a verdict, it shall not be \r\n  sent out again without its own consent unless it shall ask from the court some \r\n  further explanation of the law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1330 (1976).Â  At the \r\n  second indication of deadlock, courts typically inquire as to whether more deliberations \r\n  would be beneficial to the jury, and the issue of consent is determined from \r\n  the juryâ€™s response.Â  See Buff v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., \r\n  342 S.C. 416, 422, 537 S.E.2d 279, 282 (2000) (â€œ[W]hen a jury has twice indicated \r\n  it is deadlocked, the trial judge should diplomatically discuss with the jury \r\n  whether further deliberations could be beneficial.Â  The juryâ€™s consent to resume \r\n  or to discontinue deliberations is determined, either expressly or impliedly, \r\n  by its response to the trial judgeâ€™s comments.â€)Â  \r\nIn the case before us, deliberations for a two-day criminal trial lasted an \r\n  entire day.Â  Upon receiving notification of deadlock, the judge administered \r\n  an Allen charge.Â  When the judge received further notice of deadlock, \r\n  he diplomatically inquired whether more time would help facilitate unanimity.Â  \r\n  The jury responded with the unequivocal answer that additional time to deliberate \r\n  would not break the deadlock.Â  Not only was the declaration of mistrial at this \r\n  juncture proper, it was mandated by law.Â  Had the trial court ordered further \r\n  deliberations, any subsequent verdict would have likely been tainted.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., State v. Simon, 126 S.C. 437, 120 S.E.2d 230 (1923) (finding \r\n  the demand of further deliberations by the trial judge after clear indication \r\n  of second deadlock was coercive).Â  \r\nWe conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was no bar to the retrial of Robinson. \r\n\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Evidence of Flight\r\nThe State, over Robinsonâ€™s objection, introduced evidence of Robinsonâ€™s \r\n  flight from police officers while he was assisting them in the recovery of the \r\n  weapon used in the armed robbery.Â  Robinson argues the trial court abused its \r\n  discretion in admitting this evidence.Â  Robinson specifically contends that \r\n  because he was told he was also a suspect in an unrelated crime, the evidence \r\n  of flight was irrelevant and admitted in violation of Rule 402, SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 402, SCRE reads in relevant part, â€œ[e]vidence which is not relevant is \r\n  not admissible.â€Â  Relevant evidence is evidence â€œhaving any tendency to make \r\n  the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the \r\n  action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  \r\n  Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 127, 551 S.E.2d 240, 247 \r\n  (2001).Â  â€œFlight from prosecution is admissible as evidence of guilt.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 140, 591 S.E.2d 646, 650 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting \r\n  State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 413, 578 S.E.2d 32, 36-37 (Ct. App. 2003)).Â  \r\n  See also State v.

App. 2002) (citing 29 Am.Jur.2d \r\n  Evidence Â§ 532 (1994)) (noting that flight, when unexplained, is admissible \r\n  as indicating consciousness of guilt).Â  \r\nCase law, however, further recognizes that the relevance of flight evidence \r\n  is premised on a nexus between the flight and the offense charged.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 419-20 (4th Cir. 1981) \r\n  (finding evidence of flight inadmissible where a defendant flees â€œafter â€˜commencement \r\n  of an investigationâ€™ unrelated to the crime charged, or of which the defendant \r\n  was unawareâ€);Â  United States v. Foutz, 540 F.2d 733, 740 (4th Cir. 1976) \r\n  (stating that evidence of flight should be excluded whereÂ  defendant flees while \r\n  being investigated for another crime).Â Â  \r\nWhile we agree with Robinson that his knowledge of the murder investigation \r\n  somewhat attenuated the inference of guilt in connection with the armed robbery \r\n  charge, we believe that in the unique factual setting of this case, the trial \r\n  court acted within its discretion in admitting the flight evidence.Â  Evidence \r\n  of flight should be excluded when the flight is clearly linked to a separate \r\n  offense for which the defendant is not on trial.Â  That, however, is not the \r\n  case here.Â  Robinson was keenly aware of the armed robbery charge, for he was \r\n  assisting law enforcement in the armed robbery investigation when he fled.Â  \r\n  In reviewing a challenge to the admissibility of such evidence, the inquiry \r\n  must be an objective one.Â  We reject Robinsonâ€™s claim that his statement of \r\n  why he fled from police is dispositive on the question of admissibility.Â  Objectively \r\n  viewed, there is a sufficient nexus between Robinsonâ€™s flight and the armed \r\n  robbery charge to affirm the admission of flight evidence.Â  Furthermore, he \r\n  was allowed to present to the jury his alternative explanation of his flight, \r\n  without referencing the murder investigation.Â  We further conclude that the \r\n  probative value of this relevant evidence is not â€œsubstantially outweighed by \r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause \r\n  and no error in the admission of evidence regarding Robinsonâ€™s flight.

Registry for \r\n  Golf and Tourism, Inc., a/k/a Charleston Registry for Golf and Tourism (â€œCharleston \r\n  Registryâ€) along with Calvin Stone and Martin James Barrier (â€œAppellantsâ€) brought \r\n  this suit against the law firm of Young, Clement, Rivers &amp; Tisdale, LLP \r\n  (â€œYoung Clementâ€) alleging causes of action for negligence, breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty, and negligent supervision related to the firmâ€™s affiliation with attorney \r\n  Douglas A. Barker.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Young \r\n  Clement on all of the claims.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe claims raised in this case center around the individual business activities \r\n  and legal employment of Douglas Barker.Â  During the relevant time periods, Barker \r\n  was a partner in the fledgling business, Charleston Registry, and an associate \r\n  attorney practicing with the Young Clement law firm.Â  The origin, course, and \r\n  overlap of Barkerâ€™s independent business and legal endeavors are key to understanding \r\n  the nature of the claims brought against Young Clement.Â  The undisputed facts \r\n  surrounding these relationships are described below.\r\nBarkerâ€™s Association with Charleston \r\n  Registry\r\nBarker first met Calvin Stone and Martin J. Barrier in Charleston sometime \r\n  in the late 1980s.Â  Barker left Charleston in 1990 to attend law school in California.Â  \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Stone and Barrier formed Charleston Registry, a business \r\n  that planned and sold golf trips.\r\nBarker returned to Charleston in the summer of 1993 to complete a legal internship.Â  \r\n  During that time, he learned of Stone and Barrierâ€™s new business venture.Â  After \r\n  inquiring with Stone and Barrier, he was invited to work part-time for Charleston \r\n  Registry that summer performing accounting and bookkeeping work. \r\nAfter graduating from law school, Barker worked as an attorney in California.Â  \r\n  In 1995, while still practicing law in California, Barker contacted Stone and \r\n  Barrier about becoming involved in the business.Â  Over the course of several \r\n  phone conversations in the fall of 1995, Stone informed Barker that the business \r\n  was doing well and growing rapidly but expressed concern that the accounting \r\n  functions were becoming overwhelming for him and Barrier.Â  \r\nIn late 1995 or early 1996, Barker informed Barrier \r\n  that he was moving back to Charleston and that he would â€œsoon be employed by \r\n  a prestigious law firm in Charleston.â€Â  Barker proposed to Barrier that he could \r\n  provide legal and accounting services to Charleston Registry in exchange for \r\n  an ownership interest in the business.Â  After meeting with Barker in early 1996, \r\n  before Barkerâ€™s employment with Young Clement, Barrier decided to relinquish \r\n  his ownership interest in the business to Barker in exchange for protection \r\n  from any tax liability Charleston Registry had incurred. \r\n  [1]  \r\nAfter this agreement was reached, all accounting \r\n  functions were turned over to Barker.Â  Barker took possession of all of Charleston \r\n  Registryâ€™s financial records, the companyâ€™s post office box key, and the companyâ€™s \r\n  checkbook.Â  Stone subsequently granted Barker signature authority on the business \r\n  checking account.Â  \r\nBarkerâ€™s Employment at Young Clement\r\nAfter assuming control of the legal and financial affairs of Charleston Registry, \r\n  Barker began work as an associate attorney at Young Clement on April 1, 1996.Â  \r\n  The general terms of his employment at Young Clement were memorialized in a \r\n  May 31, 1996 letter to Barker from Thomas Tisdale, the firmâ€™s managing partner. \r\n  Regarding Barkerâ€™s work assignments, the letter provided:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    Work Assignments.Â  We are looking forward to having you work as \r\n      an associate attorney, primarily in the litigation area of our firm.Â  You \r\n      will be working with Brad Waring in connection with your training and most \r\n      of your work assignments.Â  He will be accountable to the firm for the progress \r\n      of your training.Â  You should discuss with him all matters relating to \r\n      your assignments, and with me, all other matters relating to your relationship \r\n      with the firm.Â  The firm is employing your total and best professional \r\n      efforts.Â  Although you will normally handle your work assignments during \r\n      regular office hours, we will expect you to devote such additional time \r\n      as may be necessary to complete assignments entrusted to you.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ (Emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe law firm also had in place strict procedures \r\n  for keeping track of all the professional activities its attorneys engaged in \r\n  â€” regardless of whether those activities were directly related to their work \r\n  at Young Clement.Â  Young Clement required its lawyers to record the precise \r\n  amount of time they spent working on client projects each day.Â  Young Clementâ€™s \r\n  policy, however, extended further than recording billable hours for purposes \r\n  of charging clients for services rendered.Â  Young Clement mandated that time \r\n  records be maintained for all time expended by lawyers and paralegal personnel \r\n  whether or not the particular endeavor is billable to a client, with the single \r\n  exception of the lunch break.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn direct contravention of these policies and procedures, Barker continued \r\n  to be involved with and perform services for Charleston Registry while working \r\n  at Young Clement.Â  Between April and September 1996, Barker prepared several \r\n  documents on behalf of the corporation, including proposed bylaws of the company, \r\n  a renunciation of rights for Martin Barrier, and minutes of the organizational \r\n  meeting of the board of directors.Â  Barker, Stone, and Barrier met on September \r\n  12, 1996 and executed or adopted these documents. \r\nAlso during his tenure at Young Clement, Barker used the law firmâ€™s letterhead \r\n  to write two letters pertaining to Charleston Registry.Â  The first letter, dated \r\n  December 20, 1996, was addressed to Paul Dominick, an attorney at another law \r\n  firm.Â Â  The letter indicated Barker had been retained by Calvin Stone and Charleston \r\n  Registry to represent the company in a defamation claim against clients of Dominick.Â  \r\n  Barker testified, however, that he never mailed the letter because Stone did \r\n  not think it was worth the effort to proceed with the matter after Barker faxed \r\n  Stone a draft of the letter.Â  This testimony is uncontroverted. \r\nThe second letter, dated May 22, 1997, was addressed to Stone.Â  In the letter, \r\n  Barker alleged that Stone had improperly absconded with some of Charleston Registryâ€™s \r\n  corporate accounting records and instructed Stone to ensure the records be maintained \r\n  intact.Â  Barker stated in the letter he was writing â€œ[a]s the CEO of CRGT, Inc.â€ \r\n  and â€œa 50% shareholder and director of that corporation.â€ \r\nNone of his activities involving Charleston Registry was ever discussed with \r\n  Tisdale, Waring, or any other lawyer or staff member at Young Clement.Â  Barker \r\n  never recorded any of his work for Charleston Registry on his hourly time records.Â  \r\n  Young Clement never opened a file for Charleston Registry or sent an engagement \r\n  letter to Charleston Registry.Â  Young Clement never billed Charleston Registry, \r\n  Stone, or Barrier for any services rendered by Barker.Â  Furthermore, Stone and \r\n  Barrier never had any contact with attorneys at Young Clement regarding their \r\n  involvement with Barker.\r\nIn September 1997, Barker received a demand letter from counsel for Charleston \r\n  Registry, Stone, and Barrier which alleged Barker had misappropriated corporate \r\n  funds and committed professional malpractice.Â  Barker immediately brought the \r\n  letter to the attention of Tisdale.Â  Tisdale and Waring then reviewed everything \r\n  in Barkerâ€™s files regarding Charleston Registry.Â  Tisdale fired Barker a week \r\n  later.\r\nCharleston Registry proceeded with their suit against Barker individually, \r\n  and in May of 2000, they brought the present action against Young Clement seeking \r\n  damages for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent supervision.Â  \r\n  After the close of discovery, the trial court granted Young Clementâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment in October 2002.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Tupper v. \r\n  Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997); Wells \r\n  v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n  In reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the \r\n  same standard which governs the trial court: summary judgment is proper when \r\n  â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman \r\n  v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  \r\n  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all \r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€ Strother v. Lexington County \r\n  Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Negligence\r\nAppellants first argue the trial court erred in dismissing their claims against \r\n  Young Clement for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nBefore considering whether or not there are material questions of facts sufficient \r\n  to defeat a summary judgment motion on the merits of Appellantsâ€™ claims, we \r\n  must first consider whether or not Young Clement is subject to judgment on Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  claims. Under these claims, Appellants allege that, while working as an attorney \r\n  for Young Clement, Barker agreed to perform legal and financial services for \r\n  Charleston Registry and then failed to fulfill those agreed-upon duties.Â  Though \r\n  these allegations concern only the acts and omissions of Barker, Appellants \r\n  contend Young Clement was liable based on its agency relationship with Barker.Â  \r\n  Appellants claimed Young Clement endowed Barker with apparent authority to transact \r\n  business on behalf of the law firm.Â  The trial court disagreed, ruling Appellants \r\n  failed to present any evidence to a support finding that Barker acted with the \r\n  actual or apparent authority of Young Clement.Â  \r\nAn agency relationship may be established by evidence of actual or apparent \r\n  authority.Â  Fochtman v. Clantonâ€™s Auto Auction Sales, 233 S.C. 581, 583, \r\n  106 S.E.2d 272, 274-75 (1958).Â  While actual authority is that which is expressly \r\n  conferred upon the agent by the principal, apparent authority is that which, \r\n  though not actually granted, the principal knowingly permits the agent to exercise, \r\n  or which the principal holds the agent out as possessing. Moore v. North \r\n  Am. Van Lines, 310 S.C. 236, 239, 423 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1992).Â  This Court \r\n  has further refined the definition of apparent authority:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    The doctrine of apparent authority focuses on the principalâ€™s manifestation \r\n      to a third party that the agent has certain authority. Concomitantly, the \r\n      principal is bound by the acts of its agent when it has placed the agent \r\n      in such a position that persons of ordinary prudence, reasonably knowledgeable \r\n      with business usages and customs, are led to believe the agent has certain \r\n      authority and they in turn deal with the agent based on that assumption. \r\n      Thus, the concept of apparent authority depends upon manifestations by the \r\n      principal to a third party and the reasonable belief by the third \r\n      party that the agent is authorized to bind the principal.\r\n  \r\n\r\nR &amp; G Const., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. \r\n  Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 432, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117-18 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).Â  Accordingly, â€œ[t]he proper focus in determining \r\n  a claim of apparent authority is not on the relationship between the principal \r\n  and the agent, but on that between the principal and the third party.â€ Id. \r\n  at 432, 540 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Further, â€œ[a]n agency may not be established solely \r\n  by the declarations and conduct of an alleged agent.â€Â  Frasier v. Palmetto \r\n  Homes of Florence, Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 245, 473 S.E.2d 865, 868 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996). \r\nBased upon these general principles, our courts \r\n  have required three elements be proven to establish apparent authority: â€œ(1) \r\n  that the purported principal consciously or impliedly represented another to \r\n  be his agent; (2) that there was a reliance upon the representation; and (3) \r\n  that there was a change of position to the relying partyâ€™s detriment.â€ Graves \r\n  v. Serbin Farms, Inc., 306 S.C. 60, 63, 409 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1991).Â  \r\nAppellants offered no evidence which would tend \r\n  to prove Young Clement consciously or impliedly represented to Charleston Registry \r\n  that Barker was its agent prior to Barkerâ€™s relationship with Charleston Registry.Â  \r\n  Nor did Appellants offer any evidence of a change in the character of Charleston \r\n  Registryâ€™s relationship with Barker or Young Clement after Barker began working \r\n  at Young Clement.Â  Barkerâ€™s relationship with Charleston Registry began well \r\n  before his first day of work at Young Clement.Â  As described above, Barker offered \r\n  his legal and accounting services to Charleston Registry at least four months \r\n  prior to beginning work at the law firm.Â  It is also undisputed that Barker \r\n  took possession of the companyâ€™s financial records one month before starting \r\n  with Young Clement.Â  Though Stone and Barrier claim Barker told them in early \r\n  1996 that he would soon be working for a prestigious law firm, Stone admitted \r\n  in his testimony that, at that time, he did not believe that Charleston Registry \r\n  was represented by Young Clement.\r\nAppellants have likewise failed to offer any proof \r\n  that, during the time Barker actually worked at Young Clement, the law firm \r\n  consciously or impliedly held Barker out as its agent with respect to Barkerâ€™s \r\n  handling of Charleston Registryâ€™s affairs.Â Â  In fact, the evidence, as recited \r\n  above, indicates otherwise: Young Clement never sent an engagement letter to \r\n  Charleston Registry; no retainer agreement was ever entered into between Young \r\n  Clement and Charleston Registry; the firm opened no file for Charleston Registry \r\n  or its principals, Stone and Barrier; Young Clement never billed Charleston \r\n  Registry for any services rendered or ever profited in any way from Barkerâ€™s \r\n  involvement with the company; and, Stone and Barrier admitted that neither of \r\n  them ever spoke with an attorney at Young Clement regarding Charleston Registry \r\n  or any other matter and most of their meetings with Barker took place during \r\n  lunch.\r\nThe only evidence which could have possibly indicated \r\n  Barker was acting on behalf of Young Clement were the two letters he wrote using \r\n  the firmâ€™s letterhead.Â  As noted above, however, only one of those letters was \r\n  actually mailed, and the one that was mailed clearly indicated in the body of \r\n  the letter that Barker was writing in his capacity as an owner and manager of \r\n  Charleston Registry, not as an attorney with Young Clement.Â  It would have been \r\n  wholly unreasonable, therefore, for Barrier and Stone to surmise from this letter \r\n  that the firm of Young Clement had taken on Charleston Registry as a client.Â  \r\n  Moreover, there is no evidence that Appellants relied, to their detriment, on \r\n  any representation made by Young Clement.\r\nBecause no genuine issue of fact was raised as to the first element necessary \r\n  for apparent authority, Appellantsâ€™ claims fail as a matter of law.Â  We therefore \r\n  find no error in the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on these claims.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Negligent Supervision\r\nAppellants next argue the trial court erred in dismissing their claim for negligent \r\n  supervision against Young Clement.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn this cause of action against Young Clement, Appellants claim the law firm \r\n  negligently supervised Barker by failing to adequately monitor his involvement \r\n  with Charleston Registry.Â  The disposition of this claim depends upon whether \r\n  Young Clement owed a duty to Charleston Registry. If Young Clement owed no duty \r\n  to Charleston Registry any harm suffered by Charleston Registry is irrelevant. \r\n  This is because the common law ordinarily imposes no duty on a person to act. \r\n  See Rayfield v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 297 S.C. \r\n  95, 100, 374 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 1988). Thus, a person usually incurs \r\n  no liability when he fails to take steps to protect others from harm not created \r\n  by his own wrongful conduct.Â  Id.Â  However, our supreme court has held \r\n  that an employer is under a duty in some circumstances to exercise reasonable \r\n  care to control an employee acting outside the scope of employment. See \r\n  Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 116, 420 S.E.2d 495, \r\n  496 (1992).Â  The Court in Degenhart found that an employer may be liable \r\n  for negligent supervision if the employee intentionally harms another when the \r\n  employee: (1) is upon the premises of the employer, or is using a chattel of \r\n  the employer, (2) the employer knows or has reason to know that he has the ability \r\n  to control his employee, and (3) the employer knows or should know of the necessity \r\n  and opportunity for exercising such control. Â Id. at 115-17, 420 S.E.2d \r\n  at 496; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 317 (1965) (outlining \r\n  the same elements for negligent supervision).  \r\n  [2] \r\nAs with the agency issue discussed above, the elements necessary to prove negligent \r\n  supervision of an employee acting outside of the scope of his employment are \r\n  not present in the record.Â  The record before us contains no evidence that Young \r\n  Clement knew, or should have known, of Barkerâ€™s involvement with Charleston \r\n  Registry. Therefore, Young Clement did not know of the necessity to control \r\n  Barker.\r\nThe only additional evidence Charleston Registry offered on this issue was \r\n  Young Clementâ€™s internal performance reviews of Barker.Â  In these reviews, senior \r\n  Young Clement attorneys reviewed the quality of Barkerâ€™s work and his ability \r\n  to get along with other employees at the law firm.Â  These reviews uniformly \r\n  rated Barkerâ€™s performance as poor.Â  Charleston Registry claims these negative \r\n  reviews should have alerted Young Clement to the need to monitor Barkerâ€™s activities \r\n  more closely, which they argue would have led them to discover Barkerâ€™s involvement \r\n  with Charleston Registry.Â  \r\nWe find no merit to this argument.Â  The performance \r\n  reviews contained in the record concern only Barkerâ€™s past work for Young Clement.Â  \r\n  They do not reference any of Barkerâ€™s activities beyond the quality of his assigned \r\n  work and his interaction with the firmâ€™s staff.Â Â  Moreover, they give no indication \r\n  that the Young Clement attorneys were aware of any business endeavors undertaken \r\n  by Barker.Â  The reviews, therefore, have no bearing on the question whether \r\n  Young Clement knew or should have known of Barkerâ€™s involvement with Charleston \r\n  Registry.\r\nFinding no evidence to support Charleston Registryâ€™s claim for negligent supervision, \r\n  we are compelled to affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal on summary judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHaving reviewed all the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants, \r\n  we find they have failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact on their \r\n  claims for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and negligent supervision.Â  \r\n  In sum, the undisputed material facts indicate that Barkerâ€™s relationship with \r\n  Charleston Registry was an independent business relationship.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of Young Clement \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  This agreement was not reduced to writing until \r\n    September 1996.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  An employer may have a legal duty to use due care in supervising \r\n    an employee as a result of a contractual relationship with the employee.Â  \r\n    This duty sounds in tort, not in contract.Â  This ensuing duty is limited to \r\n    the employeeâ€™s actions undertaken in his capacity as an agent for the employer.Â  \r\n    Degenhart, 309 S.C. at 117, 420 S.E.2d at 496-497; see also \r\n    Rickborn v.

Carter appeals the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the University of South \r\n  Carolina in this action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe College of Criminal Justice at the University \r\n  of South Carolina granted provisional admission to Appellant Charles D. Carter \r\n  in the spring of 1997. At the end of the semester, the program dismissed him \r\n  for academic reasons. The dismissal letter, dated May 19, 1997, stated in part: \r\n  â€œyou will not be permitted to continue in the College of Criminal Justice.â€ \r\n  Carter appealed his dismissal, using the universityâ€™s internal procedure. In \r\n  the interim, Carter was also facing difficulties concerning a disciplinary, \r\n  non-academic matter. Carter settled that disciplinary matter on September 8, \r\n  1997, by agreeing to be placed on â€œconduct probationâ€ until December 1998. Carter \r\n  also signed a form acknowledging that his â€œrights as a charged studentâ€ had \r\n  been explained to him. \r\nOn September 18, 1997, after being placed on conduct \r\n  probation and while his academic appeal was ongoing, Carter received a parking \r\n  citation from university police. Carter and the officer then argued. As a result, \r\n  the officer gave a â€œNotice of Policy Violationâ€ to Carter. The Campus Judicial \r\n  Board held a hearing on February 3, 1998, to address that incident. Carter did \r\n  not attend the meeting, but the Board ruled that Carter was responsible for \r\n  the violation and expelled him from the university. Carter appealed, arguing \r\n  that he was not a student at the time of the incident. The university denied \r\n  his appeal in a letter dated February 26, 1998, as a final disposition of the \r\n  matter. The university had already denied Carterâ€™s academic appeal on October \r\n  6, 1997. \r\nCarter sued the university in 2000, seeking injunctive \r\n  relief [1]  and a declaratory judgment that \r\n  he was not a student in September of 1997. The trial judge granted summary judgment \r\n  to the university, finding that Carter was a student within the description \r\n  of the USC Student Handbook and Policy Guide (â€œthe Handbookâ€) and that \r\n  Carter was therefore subject to the policies contained therein. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I. \r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err in ruling that Carter was a student?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err in ruling that the university police \r\n      could write the citation even if Carter was not a student since Carterâ€™s \r\n      behavior was harassing? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did Carter properly and timely plead, establish, and raise \r\n      a cognizable interest?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    IV.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n     Is Carterâ€™s request moot?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and it is clear that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n  of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn determining whether . . . triable issues of \r\n  fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Osborne ex rel. Osborne \r\n  v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001). An appellate court \r\n  reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by \r\n  the trial court.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 451, 548 S.E.2d 868, \r\n  873 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe university argues that Carter \r\n  was still a student on the day of the incident for two reasons. First, Carter \r\n  had signed a form acknowledging as much just one week earlier. Second, Carter \r\n  created a â€œcontinuing student relationshipâ€ with the university by availing \r\n  himself of the universityâ€™s internal appellate procedures. Carter strenuously \r\n  disagrees. He maintains that he was not a student on September 18, 1997, because \r\n  the university had dismissed him in the spring of that year. Additionally, Carter \r\n  contends that the phrase â€œcontinuing student relationshipâ€ is excessively vague \r\n  and is therefore unenforceable. We find that Carter was a student at the time \r\n  of the incident.\r\nOn September 8, 1997, Carter signed a â€œCase Disposition \r\n  Formâ€ to settle his disciplinary appeal. \r\n  [2]  Carter admitted on that day that the university had explained to him \r\n  his â€œrights as a charged student involved in the disciplinary process.â€ \r\n  (Emphasis added.) Carter agreed to be placed on conduct probation for fifteen \r\n  months. Carter clearly envisioned being a student well into the future. We fail \r\n  to detect any change in his status between the date of the signature and that \r\n  of the parking incident. Having been a student on September 8, Carter cannot \r\n  then argue that he was not a student on September 18. Nothing altered his status \r\n  during that time. \r\nWe now turn to the universityâ€™s second argument. \r\n  The Handbook provides in pertinent part that â€œ[p]ersons who are not officially \r\n  enrolled for a particular term but who have a continuing student relationship \r\n  with the University of South Carolina are considered â€˜students.â€™â€ \r\n  [3] Â  According to Carter, the phrase â€œcontinuing student relationshipâ€ \r\n  is not sufficiently defined. Given the facts before us, that argument must necessarily \r\n  fail.\r\nThe record shows that Carter was appealing his \r\n  dismissal from the College of Criminal Justice in the spring and early summer \r\n  of 1997. He wrote no fewer than three letters, requesting hearings, meetings, \r\n  reconsideration. Even after the parking incident, Carter sought a meeting with \r\n  the Faculty Academic Affairs Liaison Committee and admitted that he had â€œappealed \r\n  [his dismissal] all the way to the presidentâ€™s office.â€ There were also numerous \r\n  letters to Carter from university personnel on the matter. The letters made \r\n  clear that the appeal was â€œ[i]n accordance with the policy of the Board of Trusteesâ€ \r\n  and that â€œall [university] administrative (procedural) stepsâ€ were being followed. \r\n  In responding to Carterâ€™s appeals, the university relied partially on its Graduate \r\n  Studies Bulletin, a manual that addresses the rights of students \r\n  attending the university. \r\nWhen taken as a whole, the record shows that the \r\n  academic appellate process was ongoing at the time of the parking incident. \r\n  Carterâ€™s dismissal became final only on October 6, 1997, when the universityâ€™s \r\n  Board of Trustees informed Carter of its final decision. It is that letter which \r\n  terminated Carterâ€™s status as a student. \r\n  [4]  See Mason v. State ex rel. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla., \r\n  23 P.3d 964, 970 (Okla. Civ. App. 2000) (holding that any contractual relationship \r\n  which may exist between a university and a student is terminated when the student \r\n  is expelled from the university and is â€œno longer party to any contractâ€ with \r\n  the university). That letter was sent after the parking incident. We \r\n  therefore affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Carter had a continuing student \r\n  relationship with the university on September 18, 1997. \r\nHaving so ruled, we need not address Carterâ€™s remaining \r\n  issues. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 \r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining that appellate courts \r\n  need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive).Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Apparently, the university had barred Carter from entering the campus, \r\n    but the university has since agreed that Carter can enter university property. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Carter was clearly a student in the spring of \r\n    1997, having enrolled and attended classes in the College of Criminal Justice. \r\n    See Delaureal v. Forster, 816 So.2d 877, 880 (La. App. 2002) \r\n    (holding that â€œsomeone enrolled at [a university] and pursuing a [program \r\n    of studies] . . . has a primary relationship to [that university] as a studentâ€); \r\n    The American Heritage Dictionary 1208 (2d ed. 1985) (defining a student \r\n    as â€œ[o]ne who attends a school, college, or universityâ€). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] At oral argument, Carter conceded that he was bound by the Handbook.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  It is commonly held that a contract exists between a university and \r\n    its students. See, e.g., R.J. Hendricks, II v. Clemson Univ., \r\n    353 S.C. 449, 461, 578 S.E.2d 711, 717 (2003) (ruling that â€œthat some aspects \r\n    of the student/university relationship are indeed contractualâ€); Organiscak \r\n    v. Cleveland State Univ., 762 N.E.2d 1078, 1081 (Ohio Ct. 2001) (â€œIt is \r\n    axiomatic that when a student enrolls in a college or university, pays his \r\n    tuition and fees, and attends such school, the resulting relationship may \r\n    reasonably be construed as being contractual in nature.â€). However, courts \r\n    have disagreed about the extent to which student handbooks provide the terms \r\n    of that contract. Compare id.Â  (â€œThe terms of the contract between \r\n    the university and the student are generally found in the college catalog \r\n    and handbooks supplied to students.â€) and Cornett v. Miami Univ., 728 \r\n    N.E.2d 471, 473 (Ohio Ct. 2000) (â€œThe terms of the contract between the university \r\n    and the student are generally found in the college catalog and handbooks applied \r\n    to students.â€), with Pacella v. Tufts Univ. School of Dental Medicine, \r\n    66 F.Supp.2d 234, 241 (Mass. D. 1999) (ruling that the provisions of the handbook \r\n    are not contractually binding on the university in part because the university \r\n    could unilaterally modify them without notice).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3837","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n__________\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Carla \r\n  Taylor was convicted of trafficking in twenty-eight grams or more of crack cocaine \r\n  in violation of S.C. Code Ann. section 44-53-375 (C)(2) and possession of a \r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime in violation of S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  section 16-23-490.Â  On appeal, Taylor argues the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  into evidence crack cocaine seized at the time of her arrest because the State \r\n  failed to call the police evidence custodian as a witness to establish a complete \r\n  chain of custody. [1] Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFollowing a traffic stop on I-85 in Greenville \r\n  County, Highway Patrol Trooper Shannon Webber arrested Taylor for trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent \r\n  crime when a consent search of the car she was driving yielded 36.16 grams of \r\n  crack cocaine and a handgun.Â  Taylor was subsequently indicted and tried for \r\n  both offenses.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State offered the following evidence \r\n  to establish the chain of custody of the crack cocaine seized in the arrest. [2] Â  Trooper Webber testified he took possession \r\n  of a substance believed to be crack cocaine at the scene of the arrest, placing \r\n  it in a â€œbest evidence bagâ€ along with a form detailing all pertinent information. [3] Â  He then sealed the bag and turned the evidence over to his \r\n  superior officer, Sergeant Long.Â  According to Webber, once sealed, the bag \r\n  could not be opened without tearing it. \r\nSergeant Long testified that he transported the \r\n  best evidence bag containing the substance to the Department of Public Safetyâ€™s \r\n  central evidence locker in Columbia.Â  He then turned it in to the evidence custodian, \r\n  Dale Blackmon. [4]   \r\nAt the time of trial, Dale Blackmon was \r\n  no longer employed by the Department of Public Safety, and did not testify.Â  \r\n  In lieu of Blackmonâ€™s testimony, the State called the successor custodian, Corporal \r\n  Price.Â  Price explained that only the evidence custodian had access to the evidence \r\n  locker, with the exception of the supervisor and administrative assistant, who \r\n  could receive evidence when the custodian was not on duty.Â  He further testified \r\n  regarding protocol and procedure for the handling and storage of evidence by \r\n  the custodian, explaining each officer was assigned his or her own storage locker \r\n  inside of a safe within the locker room.Â  According to Price, a dangerous drug \r\n  such as cocaine is not retained by the custodian in the evidence locker, but \r\n  is immediately taken by the custodian to SLED. Â Once analyzed, it is \r\n  placed back in the original evidence bag by the SLED chemist and is heat-sealed \r\n  in another bag.Â  The SLED chemist then returns the drug to the Departmentâ€™s \r\n  evidence locker room where it is placed in the individual locker designated \r\n  solely for the arresting officer.Â  In this case, it remained in Trooper Webberâ€™s \r\n  locker until retrieved by Price for trial. \r\nChemist Ford testified that he retrieved the evidence \r\n  from the lockbox at SLED; immediately inspected it to assure there were no holes, \r\n  punctures, or tears in the best evidence bag; and ensured the original seal \r\n  by Webber had not been broken.Â  After determining there were no signs of tampering, \r\n  Ford broke the bag open, tested it, and determined it contained 36.16 grams \r\n  of crack cocaine.Â  He then placed the crack cocaine and the original best evidence \r\n  bag into another evidence bag, heat-sealed it, labeled it, and placed it back \r\n  in the vault. \r\nOver defense counselâ€™s objection, the trial court \r\n  admitted the crack cocaine into evidence, ruling the State had provided sufficient \r\n  evidence of the chain of custody without the testimony of the missing evidence \r\n  custodian.Â  Thereafter, Taylor was convicted by a jury of trafficking in crack \r\n  cocaine in an amount exceeding thirty grams and possession of a firearm during \r\n  the commission of a violent crime.Â  Taylor was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment \r\n  on the trafficking offense and five years on the weapon offense.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Taylor argues the testimony of everyone \r\n  who handled the evidence, including that of the former evidence custodian, Dale \r\n  Blackmon, was necessary to establish the chain of custody.Â  Without Blackmonâ€™s \r\n  testimony, Taylor argues, the evidence was inadmissible under the authority \r\n  of State v. Chisolm, 355 S.C. 175, 584 S.E.2d 401 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. \r\n  denied (April 8, 2004) and State v. Joseph, 328 S.C. 352, 491 \r\n  S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  We reject Taylorâ€™s broad reading of these cases \r\n  as requiring the testimony of all persons handling the evidence as a condition \r\n  of admissibility.\r\nA party offering into evidence fungible \r\n  items such as drugs or blood samples must establish a chain of custody as far \r\n  as practicable.Â  See, e.g., Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. \r\n  26, 33, 100 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1957); State v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, 522, \r\n  426 S.E.2d 306, 309 (1992); State v. Joseph, 328 S.C. 352, 364, 491 S.E.2d \r\n  275, 281 (Ct. App. 1997); State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  442, 443 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Where the analyzed substance has passed through several \r\n  hands, the evidence must not leave it to conjecture as to who had it and what \r\n  was done with it between the taking and the analysis.Â  While the proof of chain \r\n  of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering, it must establish a \r\n  complete chain of evidence as far as practicable. State v. Williams, \r\n  297 S.C. 290, 293, 376 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1989); Johnson, 318 S.C. at 196, \r\n  456 S.E.2d at 443.\r\nThe admission of evidence is addressed \r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Williams, 297 S.C. at 293, \r\n  376 S.E.2d at 774; Raino v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, \r\n  258, 422 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1992); Johnson, 318 S.C. at 196, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  at 443.Â  On appeal, the question presented is whether the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  is controlled by an error of law or is without evidentiary support.Â  State \r\n  v. Irick, 344 S.C. 460, 463, 545 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001); State v. Hughey, \r\n  339 S.C. 439, 453, 529 S.E.2d 721, 728-729 (2000);Â  see also State \r\n  v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997).Â  If there is any \r\n  evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s decision, the appellate courts will affirm \r\n  it.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nWhere the identity of persons handling \r\n  the evidence is unknown, our courts have consistently held the evidence is inadmissible.Â  \r\n  In Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 100 S.E.2d 534 (1957), our supreme \r\n  court upheld the trial judgeâ€™s exclusion of the results of blood alcohol tests \r\n  where blood was drawn from the defendant driver following an automobile accident \r\n  and transported over the Christmas holiday to the Medical College in Charleston \r\n  for testing.Â  Although there was testimony of the hospitalâ€™s customary \r\n  practice regarding the mailing of the blood, there was no evidence that the \r\n  technologist who drew the blood had sealed the vials or had otherwise taken \r\n  any precautions against tampering.Â  The record did not disclose who had possession \r\n  of the package containing the vials of blood for several days, and it left the \r\n  identity of those who handled the vials and the manner of transportation to \r\n  conjecture.Â  The unidentifiable handlers were missing links in the chain of \r\n  custody, rendering the evidence inadmissible.\r\nSubsequently, in State v. Williams, \r\n  301 S.C. 518, 392 S.E.2d 369 (1990), and State v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, \r\n  426 S.E.2d 306 (1992), our supreme court reiterated the holding in Benton \r\n  v. Pellum, noting that it is an abuse of discretion to admit the results \r\n  of a blood alcohol test where the identity of those who sealed, labeled, and \r\n  transported the blood sample is not established. Cribb, 310 S.C. at 522, \r\n  426 S.E.2d at 309.Â  See also Raino, 309 S.C. at 258, 422 \r\n  S.E.2d at 100 (ruling the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding \r\n  blood test results where the evidence failed to establish who handled the blood).\r\nIn each of these cases the party offering \r\n  the results failed to trace the handling of the evidence from the time it was \r\n  gathered until it was tested.Â  As a result, the identity of the people who had \r\n  control of the evidence and what was done with it during their possession was \r\n  left to speculation.\r\nIn contrast, where there is evidence to \r\n  establish the identity of those who have handled the evidence and the manner \r\n  in which it was handled, a weakness in the chain merely raises a question of \r\n  credibility, not admissibility.Â  The seminal case establishing this principle \r\n  in South Carolina is State v. Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 376 S.E.2d 773 \r\n  (1989).Â  In Williams, our Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the \r\n  trial court to admit blood test results even though the nurse who had drawn \r\n  the blood of the defendant and placed it in the hospital refrigerator did not \r\n  testify.Â  In that case, Nurse Yorke, who removed the blood sample from the locked \r\n  hospital refrigerator the morning after the accident and took it to the lab \r\n  for testing, did testify.Â  According to her, the vial was labeled with appellantâ€™s \r\n  name, patient number, date of birth, and the date the blood was drawn.Â  The \r\n  hospitalâ€™s internal chain of custody form was initialed by the nurse who drew \r\n  the blood, indicating she had obtained the sample from appellant and then locked \r\n  it in the refrigerator.Â  Under those circumstances, our supreme court ruled \r\n  that the initialed form complying with hospital protocol and Nurse Yorkeâ€™s testimony \r\n  sufficiently established a chain of custody to allow admission.Â  Id. \r\n  at 293, 376 S.E.2d at 774.\r\nSimilarly, where the handling of the evidence is \r\n  reasonably demonstrated, a weakness in the chain implicates credibility, but \r\n  does not render the evidence inadmissible. State v. Kahan, 268 S.C. 240, \r\n  244, 233 S.E.2d 293, 294 (1977) (ruling the ballistics test results of a nightgown \r\n  worn by the deceased and placed in the evidence locker in a plastic bag were \r\n  admissible even though there was no testimony as to the care and handling of \r\n  the plastic bag containing the gown during the time it was in the evidence locker); \r\n  State v. Smith, 326 S.C. 39, 482 S.E.2d 777 (1997) (affirming admissibility \r\n  of blood tests even though the arresting officer stored the blood sample in \r\n  his home refrigerator prior to testing, noting that there was no evidence of \r\n  tampering);Â  Johnson, 318 S.C. at 196, 456 S.E.2d at 444 (upholding the \r\n  admission of drug evidence where a discrepancy existed as to the dates of possession \r\n  of persons in the chain of custody).\r\nRecently, in State v. Carter, 344 \r\n  S.C. 419, 544 S.E.2d 835 (2001), our supreme court again noted the distinction \r\n  between a question of admissibility and a question of credibility of the evidence, \r\n  stating \r\n\r\n[w]e have found evidence inadmissible only where there is \r\n  a missing link in the chain of possession because the identity of those who \r\n  handled the blood was not established at least as far as practicable. . . . \r\n  On the other hand, where the identity of persons handling the specimen is established, \r\n  we have found evidence regarding its care goes only to the weight of the specimen \r\n  as credible evidence.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837-838.\r\nWe believe it is clear from these decisions that \r\n  if the identity of each person in the chain handling the evidence is established, \r\n  and the manner of handling is reasonably demonstrated, no abuse of discretion \r\n  is shown in the admission, absent proof of tampering, bad faith, or ill-motive.Â  \r\n  In the case at bar, there is evidence to establish the identity of each person \r\n  in the chain of possession and the manner of handling the crack cocaine.Â  The \r\n  evidence shows that the arresting officer placed the crack cocaine in a special \r\n  bag provided to preserve the integrity of the evidence against tampering.Â  It \r\n  contained a glue-like seal that, once applied, was stronger than the bag.Â  Hence, \r\n  the bag could not be opened without tearing it.Â  The arresting officer then \r\n  gave the bag to Sergeant Long to transport to the evidence custodian for safekeeping.\r\nSergeant Long provided evidence of the next two \r\n  links in the chain, himself and the non-testifying evidence custodian, Dale \r\n  Blackmon, to whom he gave the sealed evidence bag containing the drugs.Â  Corporal \r\n  Price, the current custodian, provided evidence of Blackmonâ€™s handling of the \r\n  substance as the custodian during the time it was in her control, explaining \r\n  that security and protocol required Blackmon to deliver the substance to the \r\n  SLED chemistâ€™s evidence drop box.Â  The SLED chemist, the next link in the chain, \r\n  corroborated this delivery and testified the bag was intact when it was received \r\n  for testing, identifying himself as the next link in the chain.Â  In the same \r\n  manner Nurse Yorkeâ€™s testimony, coupled with the hospital forms, adequately \r\n  established the chain of custody in State v. Williams, each person handling \r\n  the crack cocaine was identified and the manner in which it was handled explained \r\n  sufficiently to establish admissibility of the evidence here.Â  In reaching this \r\n  conclusion, we reject Taylorâ€™s reading of State v. Chisolm and State \r\n  v. Joseph, to require that all persons in the chain of custody testify to \r\n  establish admissibility.Â  \r\nIn Chisolm, the defendant was arrested for \r\n  distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine within the proximity \r\n  of a school when he sold crack cocaine to an undercover agent.Â  Following his \r\n  arrest, the arresting officer placed the crack cocaine into an evidence bag \r\n  comparable to the best evidence bag in this case.Â  He then sealed the bag and \r\n  placed it into a locked metal drop box at the police station.Â  \r\nSubsequently, dates and signatures on \r\n  the possession forms for the evidence bag indicated the first evidence technician \r\n  retrieved the crack cocaine from the lock box on May 10, 2000.Â  The next notation \r\n  indicated a second evidence technician delivered the evidence bag to a third \r\n  technician on June 15, 2000.Â  No evidence existed within the record indicating \r\n  how long the first technician possessed the bag, in what condition he received \r\n  it, where it was stored, or how the second technician came into possession of \r\n  the bag.Â  Furthermore, neither the first nor the second technician testified \r\n  at trial.\r\nUnder those circumstances, a three judge panel \r\n  of this court reversed the conviction, holding the cocaine was inadmissible \r\n  because no evidence existed to establish either the whereabouts of the evidence \r\n  between May 10 and June 15 or how the second technician came into possession \r\n  of the evidence bag.Â  In other words, the identity of the persons handling the \r\n  evidence was left to conjecture.Â  In so ruling, the Court stated: â€œCustodial \r\n  signatures on an evidence bag fail to establish an adequate chain of custody \r\n  where the custodians do not provide testimony under oath or produce sworn statements \r\n  pursuant to Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.â€Â  Id. at 801, 584 S.E.2d at 404.\r\nNotwithstanding the language quoted above, we do \r\n  not read Chisolm to require the testimony of each evidence custodian \r\n  as a prerequisite to admissibility.Â  Rather, Chisolm applies the longstanding \r\n  rule that where there are unexplained gaps in the chain of possession, leaving \r\n  to conjecture the identities of the people who handled the evidence and the \r\n  manner of handling, the evidence is inadmissible.Â  To the extent the language \r\n  quoted above can be read to require the testimony of each person in the chain \r\n  of custody under all circumstances, it is inconsistent with the precedent established \r\n  by our supreme court, and is hereby overruled.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  \r\nLikewise, we find State v. Joseph, \r\n  328 S.C. 352, 491 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1997) equally distinguishable.Â  In Joseph, \r\n  the trial judge admitted the Rule 6, SCRCrimP, affidavit of the chemist who \r\n  analyzed the drugs in lieu of his testimony over the defendantâ€™s timely objection.Â  \r\n  Not only had the chemist tested the drugs, he also kept them for over six months \r\n  outside of the controlled environment of the evidence locker room.Â  \r\nConstruing Rule 6, this court held the affidavit \r\n  was inadmissible.Â  The admission of the affidavit, which contained the analysis \r\n  report including the opinion of the chemist, violated the defendantâ€™s right \r\n  to cross-examine the chemist.Â  Furthermore, because it was inadmissible and \r\n  the chemist did not testify, there was no admissible evidence to explain where \r\n  the drugs had been or how they were handled during the six months.Â  Neither \r\n  the identity of the person in possession nor the manner of handling was established \r\n  without the inadmissible affidavit.Â  Consequently, there was a gap in the chain \r\n  of custody. \r\nUnlike Chisolm and Joseph, \r\n  in this case the State introduced evidence to establish the identity of each \r\n  person in the chain of possession and the manner of handling.Â  Consequently, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the crack cocaine into evidence.Â  \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, Taylorâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, ANDERSON, HUFF, STILWELL, BEATTY, \r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Taylor did not challenge the admission of the weapon at trial.Â  The \r\n    State argues on appeal that the weapon conviction is not implicated by Taylorâ€™s \r\n    attack on the conviction for the underlying offense of trafficking in crack \r\n    cocaine.Â  Because we affirm the trafficking conviction, we need not address \r\n    this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Taylor objected to the use of affidavits to establish the chain of \r\n    custody in accordance with Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  According to the testimony, this information included: a control \r\n    number used throughout the chain of custody, the officerâ€™s name and employing \r\n    agency, the date, the defendantâ€™s name, whether or not the arrest was lawful, \r\n    the location of the arrest, and a brief description of the substance placed \r\n    in the bag.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Blackmonâ€™s name appears incorrectly throughout the record as Blackburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3838","title":"Lazer Construction v.

(Valentine) \r\n  appeals a jury verdict in favor of Lazer Construction Company.Â  We reverse and \r\n  remand. [1] \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nLazer is a South Carolina corporation \r\n  engaged in the construction business.Â  To promote employee retention, \r\n  it has provided health insurance for its workers since 1984.Â  As a cost-saving \r\n  measure, it has followed the practice of changing health insurance providers \r\n  about every two years.\r\nIn late 1996, on the recommendation of office manager Nancy \r\n  Simms, Lazer employed Valentine to procure health insurance for its employees.Â  \r\n  After Valentine had presented to Lazer coverage options from several sources,Â  \r\n  Lazer selected health plans administered by The Fidelity Group (collectively \r\n  referred to as â€œthe planâ€).Â  Lazer enrolled its employees in the plan \r\n  on April 1, 1997. \r\nThe application for participation and membership in the plan \r\n  stated the plan was regulated under the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security \r\n  Act of 1974, as amended, and was not subject to minimum standards or mandated \r\n  benefits provisions of the insurance laws of any state.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  according to Valentineâ€™s information, Fidelity had reinsurance arrangements \r\n  with Reliance Indemnity.\r\nThe South Carolina Department of Insurance advised Valentine \r\n  by letter dated May 13, 1997, that it was investigating the plan because it \r\n  had reason to believe that the plan was governed by state law and that Valentine, \r\n  in marketing and selling the plan, had failed to comply with certain statutes.Â  \r\n  The letter further instructed Valentine to â€œcease immediately all marketing \r\n  and sales of [the plan], and related plans within the State of South Carolina.â€ \r\n  Â In July 1997, Lazer learned through Simms of the pending investigation.Â  \r\n  In addition, in August or September 1997, it became apparent to Lazer that \r\n  there were problems with employee claims not being paid.\r\nValentine also learned that, contrary to his earlier information, \r\n  the plan was not backed with reinsurance arrangements by Reliance Indemnity, \r\n  but did not inform Lazer about this problem.Â  Valentine, however, \r\n  did become concerned that Fidelity was having too many problems to work through \r\n  and communicated this concern to several of its clients, including Lazer.Â  \r\n  With regard to Lazer, Arnold Valentine told Simms that they â€œneeded to start \r\n  putting together alternate plans to be ready to exit Fidelity.â€Â  To that \r\n  end, Valentine presented other plan options to Lazer in October 1997.Â  Lazer, \r\n  however, re-enrolled in the plan on April 1, 1998. \r\nIn May 1998, Arnold Valentine attended a meeting in Summerville \r\n  held by two other agents who had also distributed the plan.Â  After the \r\n  meeting, Valentine undertook to set up a system to document claims for payment \r\n  from the plan.Â  Sometime shortly after the meeting, Arnold Valentine \r\n  met with Simms and Ken Hicks, the president of Lazer, to discuss the \r\n  status of the plan to determine whether Lazer should move to another provider \r\n  for coverage.Â  Although Valentine informed Hicks of his concerns about the plan \r\n  and Hicks and Simms monitored the situation closely, Lazer did not authorize \r\n  Valentine to change its coverage to another company until August 1998.\r\nLazer then sued for damages, alleging Valentine sold an underfunded \r\n  health and medical policy issued by a company not licensed to do business in \r\n  South Carolina.Â  The complaint listed four causes of action:Â  breach \r\n  of contract, negligence, fraud, and unfair trade practices.Â  Valentine \r\n  answered and alleged several defenses, including comparative negligence and \r\n  assumption of the risk.\r\nThe trial proceeded solely on Lazerâ€™s claims of negligence \r\n  and gross negligence.Â  At the close of the testimony, the trial court \r\n  granted Lazerâ€™s motion for a directed verdict as to Valentineâ€™s liability.Â  \r\n  The trial court also struck Valentineâ€™s defenses of comparative negligence \r\n  and assumption of the risk and refused to charge the jury on either defense.\r\nThe jury awarded Lazer actual and punitive damages.Â  The \r\n  trial court denied Valentineâ€™s post-trial motions, and this appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nValentine contends the trial court erred \r\n  in directing a verdict on the issue of liability.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œTo establish a cause of action in negligence, \r\n  a plaintiff must prove the following three elements:Â  (1) a duty of care owed \r\n  by defendant to plaintiff;Â  (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; \r\n  and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.â€ [2]  Furthermore, â€œ[a] determination of negligence, \r\n  standing alone, is a far cry from a determination of liability. Liability encompasses \r\n  all elements of a negligence claim, including damages proximately caused by \r\n  the alleged negligence.â€ [3] Â  \r\nThe trial court determined Lazer was entitled \r\n  to a directed verdict on the issue of liability because John Oâ€™Brien, its expert, \r\n  testified that Valentine had breached its duty to Lazer in failing to investigate \r\n  adequately the funding, licensing, and insurance rating of the plan.Â  This \r\n  testimony, however, does not conclusively establish that Valentine had \r\n  breached any duty to Lazer or that the alleged deficiencies in Valentineâ€™s performance \r\n  were the proximate cause of Lazerâ€™s damages.\r\nIndeed, Oâ€™Brien acknowledged that Valentine, \r\n  in investigating the plan, acted reasonably in relying on the advice and judgment \r\n  of other agents, health care providers, and satisfied customers, as well as \r\n  on the fact that several large companies had contracted with the plan.Â  He \r\n  also agreed that an insurance agent would not have the authority to switch a \r\n  customer to another plan without the customerâ€™s consent.\r\nFurthermore, as counsel for Valentine noted, Valentine \r\n  had communicated concerns to Lazer about the plan and quoted alternatives as \r\n  early as October 1997.Â  In addition, Arnold Valentine testified that \r\n  he had spoken with Simms about the matter during the fall of 1997, advising \r\n  her of the need to explore other programs so that Lazer would be ready to drop \r\n  its coverage with Fidelity.Â  Lazer, however, though aware of these concerns, \r\n  re-enrolled in the plan in April 1998 and did not change its coverage until \r\n  the following August. \r\nUnder these circumstances, we hold the trial court \r\n  should have allowed the jury to determine whether Valentine had breached its \r\n  duty of care to Lazer and whether the alleged breach of this duty was the proximate \r\n  cause of Lazerâ€™s damages. [4] Â  \r\n  We therefore reverse the jury verdict on this ground and remand the case for \r\n  a new trial.

failure to stop for a police vehicle, and \r\n  armed robbery.Â  Following a jury trial, Appellant was convicted of all three \r\n  charges.Â  During trial, Appellant asked for and was denied a suppression hearing \r\n  concerning the show-up identification of his alleged co-participant.Â  We reverse \r\n  and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn or about 4:00 p.m. on the afternoon of October 5, 2001, a black male robbed \r\n  the Alltel Communications store located on Floyd Baker Boulevard in Gaffney, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  The perpetrator entered the store with his back to the storeâ€™s \r\n  two female employees.Â  As the man turned to face the employees, he pulled a \r\n  black mask over his face, brandished a black handgun, and ordered the employees \r\n  to fill a bag with money.Â \r\nThe two employees began filling the bag with money from one of the storeâ€™s cash \r\n  registers, when the man ordered one of the women to open the second cash register.Â  \r\n  However, the employees could not find the keys to the second register.Â  While \r\n  in the back looking for the keys, the man forced one of the women to open the \r\n  storeâ€™s safe.Â  After finding the safe empty, the man told one of the women to \r\n  keep looking for the keys to the register.Â  Realizing they would not be able \r\n  to open the second register, the man took both women into the back of the store \r\n  and made them lie down on the floor.Â  The employees lay on the floor as instructed \r\n  until they heard the front door buzzer.Â  Assuming the robber had left the store, \r\n  the employees went to the front of the store, locked the door, and called 911.Â \r\nThe robbery \r\n  lasted approximately ten minutes and resulted in a little over four hundred \r\n  dollars being stolen.Â  When police arrived on the scene, the employees described \r\n  the robber as a black male who wore a blue shirt and dark pants.Â  Sometime later, \r\n  an individual was brought back to the store, and both women positively identified \r\n  this person as the robber.Â  One of the women testified, although the man never \r\n  removed the mask during the robbery, they were able to see the side of his face \r\n  as he pulled the mask down.Â  Both women testified they never saw a car in the \r\n  parking lot, but they heard a car door and assumed it was a customer coming \r\n  in when the robber entered the store.Â \r\nOn October \r\n  5, 2001, shortly after starting his 4:00 shift, Trooper Johnnie Godfrey with \r\n  the South Carolina Highway Patrol was traveling on Floyd Baker Boulevard near \r\n  the Alltel store when a vehicle came from his right and cut him off.Â  At this \r\n  point, Trooper Godfrey testified that he turned on his blue lights and attempted \r\n  to pull over the car for the purpose of issuing a warning for improper lane \r\n  change and failing to yield the right-of-way.Â  The car pulled into a parking \r\n  lot, but failed to stop, instead exiting on another street and heading up the \r\n  interstate toward Blacksburg.Â  A pursuit ensued involving several officers, \r\n  including the Highway Patrol and the Blacksburg City Police Department.Â \r\nThe pursued \r\n  car left Gaffney and headed up I-85 toward North Carolina, sideswiping a car \r\n  and turning off the interstate.Â  A bystander testified that she observed the \r\n  chase and as the car approached her, she saw someone toss a gun from the passenger \r\n  side window.Â  Officer Christy Poole of the Gaffney City Police Department searched \r\n  the area where the gun was allegedly thrown and retrieved a black handgun.Â \r\nThe chase \r\n  ended after the pursued car attempted to make a right hand turn and ran off \r\n  the road and into a field.Â  The two occupants then jumped from the car as it \r\n  was still rolling, and fled.Â  The driver of the vehicle was quickly apprehended \r\n  and identified as appellant, Robert Miller.Â \r\nMiller \r\n  was placed in the back seat of Sergeant Mark Goochâ€™s patrol car.Â  Miller remained \r\n  in the car for a period of fifteen to twenty minutes, while detectives and the \r\n  crime scene unit responded to the scene.Â  Sergeant Gooch testified that while \r\n  en route to the detention center, Miller commented â€œI heard someone say something \r\n  about a robbery.Â  I donâ€™t know anything about a robbery.Â  I wasnâ€™t even near \r\n  an Alltel store.â€Â  Miller also questioned what the crime scene officers were \r\n  doing at the vehicle, and when the sergeant told him they were recovering evidence \r\n  and asked Miller if he was worried about them finding his fingerprints on the \r\n  guns, he stated, â€œmy man had a gun.â€Â  After hesitating, Miller then said, â€œif \r\n  you will get a detective to talk to me, Iâ€™ll tell them what they need to know.â€Â  \r\n  Officer Gooch stated that, while Miller was seated in his car, he did not mention \r\n  a robbery or any charges against him to Miller.Â  He admitted, however, that \r\n  his police radio was on while Miller was seated in the car, and he did discuss \r\n  these matters with other officers outside of the car, about fifteen feet behind \r\n  the patrol vehicle.Â \r\nOnce \r\n  he was transported to the local detention center, a datamaster test was administered.Â  \r\n  Trooper Godfrey testified he smelled an odor of alcohol on appellant and suspected \r\n  appellant had been using marijuana.Â  Based on the datamaster test, the trooper \r\n  asked Miller to submit to a urine test and Miller refused.Â  Trooper Godfrey \r\n  charged Appellant with driving under the influence and Miller subsequently pled \r\n  guilty to the charge.Â \r\nThe passenger from the vehicle was apprehended after he was found hiding in \r\n  an outbuilding approximately two hundred yards from where the car was abandoned.Â  \r\n  This individual, identified as Tavo Glenn, was wearing a blue shirt and dark \r\n  pants when apprehended.Â  Mr. Glenn had several items in his possession when \r\n  he was arrested including a little over four hundred dollars, a pair of latex \r\n  gloves, and eight to ten rounds of .380 caliber pistol ammunition.Â  A search \r\n  of the automobile produced a .380 caliber silver handgun, found under the passenger \r\n  seat.Â \r\nShortly \r\n  after Glennâ€™s apprehension, Captain Skinner of the Gaffney Police Department \r\n  arrived on the scene and instructed one of his officers to take Glenn back to \r\n  the Alltel store to be identified.Â  When Glenn arrived at the Alltel store, \r\n  the officers took him out of the patrol car and placed him in front of the vehicle, \r\n  twenty to twenty-five feet from the front door of the store.Â  Glenn was handcuffed \r\n  and was the only civilian in the area, standing among police officers.Â  The \r\n  two employees positively identified Glenn as the perpetrator of the robbery.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, both Glenn and Miller were charged with armed robbery.Â \r\nAppellant \r\n  took the stand and admitted that he was the driver of the vehicle and that he \r\n  intentionally failed to stop when he saw the police carsâ€™ blue lights.Â  He claimed \r\n  he did not see the lights while on Floyd Baker Boulevard, but noticed them after \r\n  he cut through a parking lot, and thought he was being pulled for cutting through \r\n  the lot to avoid a red light.Â  Miller claimed that he rode with Glenn to Gaffney \r\n  so that Glenn could get some marijuana.Â  The two were riding around smoking \r\n  and drinking and made some stops along the way for Glenn to sell some of the \r\n  drugs.Â  They also stopped for Miller to go to the bathroom, at which point he \r\n  took over driving since Glennâ€™s license had been suspended.Â  Miller stated that \r\n  he failed to stop for the blue lights because he was on parole and he knew there \r\n  was a gun in the car, as well as significant amounts of illegal drugs.Â  At some \r\n  point during the chase, Miller saw Glenn throw something out the window. He \r\n  knew that Glenn was getting rid of the drugs, but he did not know if Glenn threw \r\n  a gun out the window.Â  Miller denied that he robbed anyone.Â  He stated he did \r\n  not know anything about the Alltel robbery until after he was put in the police \r\n  car.Â  While sitting in the car, he was listening to the police radio, and â€œheard \r\n  them keep bringing up something about armed robbery.â€Â  He stated he must have \r\n  heard them specifically mention Alltel.Â \r\nPrior \r\n  to trial, defense counsel moved for a suppression hearing pursuant to State \r\n  v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000), based on the unduly suggestive \r\n  show-up identification of Tavo Glenn.Â  Recognizing Glenn was not on trial in \r\n  this case and had already been convicted in the matter, defense counsel nonetheless \r\n  argued Miller was entitled to such a hearing as this was a â€œhand of one, hand \r\n  of all caseâ€ and the identification of Glenn was a critical part of the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case against Miller.Â  The defense asserted the court needed to make a determination \r\n  of the reliability of the evidence prior to the matter going before the jury.Â \r\nThe \r\n  trial court pointed out that it had held such a hearing in Glennâ€™s trial and, \r\n  although it acknowledged that courts generally disfavor one person show-ups, \r\n  the court had found the necessary requirements of the law met and admitted the \r\n  identification in Glennâ€™s trial.Â  Because Glenn had already been tried and convicted, \r\n  the court held that his identification was not an issue in Millerâ€™s case.Â  Defense \r\n  counsel countered the State elected to try Glenn and Miller separately, and \r\n  as a result, Miller was not present during the proceedings in Glennâ€™s trial \r\n  dealing with the identification issue.Â  He therefore never had the opportunity \r\n  to cross-examine the witnesses.Â  Finding no case law to give guidance on the \r\n  matter, the court determined Miller was not entitled to an in camera \r\n  hearing regarding the identification of Glenn as the perpetrator.Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant \r\n  argues the trial court erred by failing to conduct a suppression hearing related \r\n  to the show-up identification of his alleged co-participant, Tavo Glenn.Â  We \r\n  agree.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have consistently held that when identification of a defendant \r\n  is at issue, â€œthe general rule is that a trial court must hold an in camera \r\n  hearing when the State offers a witness whose testimony identifies the defendant \r\n  as the person who committed the crime, and the defendant challenges the in-court \r\n  identification as being tainted by a previous, illegal identification or confrontation.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Ramsey, 345 S.C. 607, 613, 550 S.E.2d 294, 297 (2001) (citing \r\n  State v. Cash, 257 S.C. 249, 185 S.E.2d 525 (1971)).Â  In State v. \r\n  Simmons, 308 S.C. 80, 417 S.E.2d 92 (1992), our Supreme Court noted the \r\n  court had adopted a per se rule requiring the trial court to hold an \r\n  in camera hearing in such situations.Â  Simmons, 308 S.C. at 82-83, \r\n  417 S.E.2d at 93.Â \r\nThis court has also recently addressed the issue of a defendantâ€™s right to an \r\n  in camera hearing concerning the admissibility of identification of the \r\n  accused.Â  In State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 561 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002), this court recognized the per se rule adopted by our courts.Â  \r\n  Cheatham, 349 S.C. at 117-118, 561 S.E.2d at 627.Â  There, the defendant \r\n  moved for a hearing outside the presence of the jury regarding his identification \r\n  pursuant to Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375 (1972), State \r\n  v. Washington, 323 S.C. 106, 473 S.E.2d 479 (Ct. App. 1996), and Rule 104(c), \r\n  SCRE.Â  The trial judge denied this request.Â  Cheatham, 349 S.C. at 112-13, \r\n  561 S.E.2d at 624-25.Â  This court found Rule 104(c), SCRE, â€œunambiguously mandates \r\n  hearings on the admissibility of out of court identifications of the accused \r\n  shall in all cases be held outside the presence of the jury.â€Â  Rule 104(c) provides \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nHearing of Jury.Â  \r\n  Hearings on the admissibility of confessions or statements by an accused, \r\n  and pretrial identifications of an accused shall in all cases be conducted \r\n  out of the hearing of the jury.Â  Hearings on other preliminary matters shall \r\n  be so conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is \r\n  a witness and so requests.\r\n\r\nÂ Rule \r\n  104(c), SCRE (emphasis added).Â \r\nIn Cheatham, we pointed out that the in camera hearing required \r\n  by Rule 104(c) allowed for a more vigorous cross-examination that might otherwise \r\n  be curtailed if such an examination were conducted in the presence of the jury, \r\n  thereby requiring the defendant to risk alienating himself from the jurors.Â  \r\n  Cheatham, 349 S.C. at 117, 561 S.E.2d at 627. Based on Rule 104(c) and \r\n  prior case law, this court reaffirmed the rule requiring an in camera \r\n  hearing when a defendant challenges the in-court identification of defendant \r\n  as being tainted by a previous illegal identification.Â  Cheatham, 349 \r\n  S.C. at 117-18, 561 S.E.2d at 626-27.\r\nAlthough the procedures to be followed when a defendant challenges an in-court \r\n  identification of himself on the basis that it has been tainted by a prior illegal \r\n  or suggestive identification are clearly established, South Carolina courts \r\n  have yet to address whether the same procedures are to be followed when, as \r\n  here, the defendant seeks to challenge the identification of an alleged co-participant.Â  \r\n  The State contends Miller has no standing to challenge the line-up identification \r\n  of another because constitutional rights are personal rights.Â  Miller asserts, \r\n  under the facts of this case, due process requires that he be allowed to challenge \r\n  the identification process.Â  He contends he was never identified as a participant \r\n  in the robbery and his only connection to the robbery is that he was apprehended \r\n  with Glenn.Â  He further argues the issue is the reliability of the evidence.Â Â \r\nWhile there are no South Carolina cases directly on point, other jurisdictions \r\n  have examined the issue of whether a defendant has standing to challenge the \r\n  identification of an alleged co-participant.Â  In People v. Bisogni, 483 \r\n  P.2d 780 (Cal. 1971), the defendant sought to challenge the show-up identification \r\n  of one of his alleged co-participants in a robbery.Â  The defendant introduced \r\n  alibi evidence that he and his alleged co-participant were somewhere else on \r\n  the night of the crime.Â  Id. at 782.Â  Therefore, if this co-participant \r\n  were proven to be one of the perpetrators, it would effectively destroy the \r\n  defendantâ€™s alibi.Â \r\nThe California Supreme Court noted the reason for excluding unfairly conducted \r\n  show-up identification evidence is that such evidence is unreliable as a matter \r\n  of law and may result in the conviction of innocent persons.Â  As pointed out \r\n  by that court, such evidence is equally unreliable whether it involves the identity \r\n  of the defendant, or the identity of a co-participant.Â  Based on the circumstances \r\n  of that case, the court held that â€œwhenever the identity of a confederate is \r\n  essential to prove the defendantâ€™s participation in a crime and when, as here, \r\n  such evidence effectively destroys the defense offered by the defendant, he \r\n  has standing to challenge the fairness of the identification procedures of the \r\n  alleged co-participant.â€Â  Id. at 783.Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSimilarly, in the more recent case of State v. Clausell, 580 A.2d 221 \r\n  (N.J. 1990), the Supreme Court of New Jersey considered the issue of a challenge \r\n  to the identification of a co-defendant.Â  In Clausell, as in Bisogni, \r\n  defendant presented the alibi defense that neither he nor his co-defendant were \r\n  at the scene of the crime.Â  Id. at 234.Â  Finding that the defendant did \r\n  have standing to challenge the identification of his co-defendant, the court \r\n  held that â€œ[a]lthough a litigant generally may assert only his or her constitutional \r\n  rights, when the party raising the claim is not simply an interloper and the \r\n  proceeding serves the public interest, standing will be found.â€Â  Id. \r\n  (citations omitted).Â  Noting that any evidence that placed the co-defendant \r\n  at the scene of the crime bolstered the Stateâ€™s case against the defendant, \r\n  the court held â€œ[b]ecause defendant has a substantial personal stake in the \r\n  admissibility of the identification evidence, . . . [defendant] has standing \r\n  to challenge the trial courtâ€™s ruling on that question.â€Â  Id.\r\nA \r\n  similar situation presents itself under the facts of the current case.Â  As Miller \r\n  points out, he was never identified by the victims of the robbery and the only \r\n  thing linking him to the robbery of the Alltel store is the fact that he was \r\n  apprehended in the company of Tavo Glenn, who in turn, was identified as the \r\n  person who perpetrated the robbery.Â  Neither of the eyewitnesses saw the car \r\n  the robber may have used, much less whether there was another person involved \r\n  who may have been the driver of that car.Â  As in Clausell and Bisogni, \r\n  the success or failure of Millerâ€™s defense â€“ that he knew nothing about the \r\n  robbery â€“ turns largely on the identification of Tavo Glenn as the perpetrator \r\n  of the crime.Â \r\nThe \r\n  State argues that Miller does not have standing to challenge the identification \r\n  procedure used in regard to Glenn because such rights are constitutional rights, \r\n  personal to Glenn.Â  We disagree. While a defendant challenging the admissibility \r\n  of evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights must often show he \r\n  is challenging the evidence based on a personal violation of his rights by the \r\n  manner in which the evidence was obtained, a person requesting a hearing as \r\n  to identification evidence is challenging the evidence based on the reliability \r\n  of that evidence.Â  For example, it is generally recognized that one does not \r\n  have standing to challenge the admission of evidence obtained based on the violation \r\n  of anotherâ€™s constitutional rights.Â  Thus, where one does not have an expectation \r\n  of privacy, he may not challenge the admission of evidence based on the violation \r\n  of anotherâ€™s right to privacy.Â  See State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. \r\n  110, 115, 352 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1987) (defendant who seeks to suppress evidence \r\n  on Fourth Amendment grounds must demonstrate he has a legitimate expectation \r\n  of privacy in connection with the searched premises in order to have standing \r\n  to challenge the search).Â Â  The concern under the current set of facts is not \r\n  whether oneâ€™s personal constitutional rights were violated in obtaining the \r\n  evidence, but whether the evidence obtained is unreliable, such that failure \r\n  to suppress the evidence violates oneâ€™s due process rights.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  find Miller has standing to challenge the reliability of the identification \r\n  of Glenn.\r\nThe \r\n  State contends, however, that even if there was error in the identification \r\n  procedure, such error was harmless as the evidence of Millerâ€™s guilt was overwhelming, \r\n  and was sufficient to conclusively establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\n  Again, we disagree.\r\nWhether \r\n  an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  State \r\n  v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 562, 575 S.E.2d 77, 83 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Error \r\n  is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  \r\n  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  â€œWhen \r\n  guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other \r\n  rational conclusion can be reached, the Court should not set aside a conviction \r\n  because of insubstantial errors not affecting the result.â€Â  State v. Bailey, \r\n  298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).\r\nHere, \r\n  assuming the identification evidence was improperly admitted, we cannot conclude \r\n  it could not have reasonably affected the result of Millerâ€™s trial.Â  Miller \r\n  was never identified as a participant in the robbery of the Alltel store.Â  Indeed, \r\n  no direct evidence was presented that the robbery was accomplished by anyone \r\n  other than a lone gunman.Â  While we acknowledge that there is circumstantial \r\n  evidence of Millerâ€™s participation in the crime by way of Millerâ€™s apprehension \r\n  with Glenn and the circumstances surrounding that apprehension, it cannot be \r\n  said that, without the identification of Glenn, Millerâ€™s guilt was conclusively \r\n  proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion could be \r\n  reached.Â  Accordingly, we find any error in the admission of the identification \r\n  evidence was not harmless.Â Â Â \r\nIn light of the critical nature of the identification of Glenn to the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case against Miller, we find, under the facts of this particular case, the interests \r\n  of justice required a preliminary hearing be conducted outside the hearing of \r\n  the jury on the pretrial identification of Glenn, \r\n  [1]  and the trial court erred in refusing to hold such a hearing.Â  It does \r\n  not follow, however, that Miller is entitled to a new trial.Â  Rather, we remand \r\n  this case to the trial court for the purpose of conducting an in camera \r\n  hearing to determine whether the identification of Glenn was so tainted as to \r\n  require its suppression at trial.Â  Should such a finding be made, Miller will \r\n  then be entitled to a new trial.Â  See State v. Simmons, 308 S.C. \r\n  80, 83, 417 S.E.2d 92, 93-94 (1992) (proper remedy where court erroneously refuses \r\n  to hold suppression hearing on identification is remand for such a hearing).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] As previously noted, Rule 104(c), SCRE provides that hearings on pretrial \r\n    identifications of an accused shall be conducted out of the hearing of the \r\n    jury, and â€œ[h]earings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when \r\n    the interests of justice require . . . .â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3833","title":"Ellison v.

Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(g) (1986); Stephen v. Avins \r\n    Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Frigidaire contends the circuit court \r\n    erred in awarding Ellison permanent, total disability compensation for his \r\n    injured leg. Â We agree.\r\n  South Carolina replaced \r\n    traditional tort recovery for workplace injuries with the present system of \r\n    workersâ€™ compensation in an effort to reduce litigation and provide injured \r\n    workers with prompt and certain recovery.Â  Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., \r\n    Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 115, 580 S.E.2d 100, 107 (2003) (â€œBy displacing traditional \r\n    tort law the Legislature intended to provide a no-fault system focusing on \r\n    quick recovery, relatively ascertainable awards and limited litigation.â€).Â  \r\n    One of the methods by which the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act facilitates this \r\n    purpose is through streamlining recovery for certain enumeratedâ€”or â€œscheduledâ€â€”injuries.Â  \r\n    Section 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2003) provides \r\n    specific recoveries for total or partial physical losses and impairments suffered \r\n    by an employee to certain scheduled members including: thumbs, fingers, toes, \r\n    hands, arms, feet, legs, eyes, and ears.Â  Recovery for an injury to a scheduled \r\n    member varies only with the degree of impairment; lost earning potential is \r\n    wholly irrelevant.Â  Bateman v. Town &amp; Country Furniture Co., 287 \r\n    S.C. 158, 160, 336 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App.1985) (â€œLoss of earnings is not \r\n    required for recovery under [the scheduled member] section; compensation is \r\n    based on the character of the injury.â€).Â  By codifying recovery for injuries \r\n    to scheduled members, â€œthe legislature presumes a claimant has lost earning \r\n    capacity to a degree which corresponds to the claimant's degree of impairment.â€Â  \r\n    Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co., 315 S.C. 440, 446, 434 S.E.2d 292, 295 \r\n    (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  In Singleton v. Young \r\n    Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 471, 114 S.E.2d 837, 845 (1960), our supreme \r\n    court stated the following in addressing the ability of a claimant to recover \r\n    more than the statutory amount for a scheduled injury: \r\n  \r\n  Where the injury is confined to the scheduled member, and \r\n    there is no impairment of any other part of the body because of such injury, \r\n    the employee is limited to the scheduled compensation, even though other considerations \r\n    such as age, lack of training, or other conditions peculiar to the individual, \r\n    effect a total or partial industrial incapacity. To obtain compensation in \r\n    addition to that scheduled for the injured member, claimant must show that \r\n    some other part of his body is affected.\r\n  \r\n  See also Wigfall, \r\n    354 S.C. at 106, 580 S.E.2d at 103 (â€œSingleton stands for the exclusive \r\n    rule that a claimant with one scheduled injury is limited to the recovery \r\n    under Â§ 42-9-30 alone.â€).Â  Thus, only where an injury to a scheduled member \r\n    is accompanied by additional complications affecting another part of the body \r\n    can an award exceed scheduled recovery.Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 \r\n    S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Otherwise, if no causal \r\n    connection exists, scheduled recovery is exclusive.Â  Brown v. Owen Steel \r\n    Co., 316 S.C. 278, 280, 450 S.E.2d 57, 58 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n  Here, the only injury \r\n    caused by the forklift accident is the tibia/fibula fracture, an injury to \r\n    a scheduled member.Â  No matter how severely Ellisonâ€™s other medical conditions \r\n    debilitate him, no causal connection exists between his fractured leg and \r\n    his sleep apnea, diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, or prostate \r\n    cancer. [1] Â  Because the leg \r\n    injury caused neither of these conditions nor any other additional injuries, \r\n    the circuit court should have determined Ellisonâ€™s recovery was limited to \r\n    scheduled member recovery.Â  \r\n  Ellison argues that \r\n    the legislatureâ€™s establishment of the Second Injury Fund is indicative of \r\n    its intent to provide permanent and total disability benefits to an employee \r\n    whose injury to a scheduled member renders the employee totally disabled due \r\n    to a pre-existing medical condition.Â  We disagree.Â  The provisions of section \r\n    42-9-400(a) of the South Carolina Code (1976) merely entitle an employerâ€™s \r\n    insurance carrier to be reimbursed by the Fund if injuries to an employee \r\n    are amplified because of the employeeâ€™s pre-existing medical conditions.Â  \r\n    The intent of the statute is to encourage the employment of people with disabilities; \r\n    it is not meant to modify the law clearly set forth in Singleton.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n  Because there is no \r\n    dispute that Ellisonâ€™s injury was confined to his leg and there is no evidence \r\n    that the injury affected any other body part, the decision of the circuit \r\n    court is\r\n  REVERSED.\r\n  STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Ellison argues that the case of Simmons v. City of Charleston, \r\n    349 S.C. 64, 562 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 2002), supports his argument that he \r\n    can recover total and permanent disability from an injury to one scheduled \r\n    body member.Â  We disagree.Â  In Simmons, our court found that where \r\n    an injury to one scheduled body member impairs another body member, a claimant \r\n    may recover total and permanent disability.Â  However, here, there is absolutely \r\n    no evidence that Ellisonâ€™s fractured leg affected any other body part or exacerbated \r\n    any of his other medical conditions.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3834","title":"Myrtle Beach v.

Michael Baxley granted the motion to amend.Â  On March 4, 2002, Appellant \r\n  again moved to dismiss the counterclaim for trespass based on South Carolina \r\n  State Highway Department v. Moody, 267 S.C. 130, 226 S.E.2d 423 (1976).Â  \r\n  Moody holds, â€œa condemnation proceeding, or an appeal therefrom, is not \r\n  a proper proceeding in which to seek redress for trespass and/or damages, proximately \r\n  caused by negligence.â€Â  Id. at 134, 226 S.E.2d at 424.Â  The Moody \r\n  court reasoned that â€œ[a]llowing the landowner to pursue inverse condemnation \r\n  within this condemnation proceeding denied the Department of due process, because \r\n  it obviously had no notice that the landowners would seek compensation for damages \r\n  . . . growing out of the negligent conduct of the independent contractor.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 136, 226 S.E.2d at 426.Â  \r\nOn June 13, 2002, Judge Steven H. John granted \r\n  Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss, finding, under Moody, Respondents could \r\n  not assert a counterclaim for trespass in a condemnation action.Â  However, Judge \r\n  John decided that despite the fact that the Tort Claims Actâ€™s two-year statute \r\n  of limitations would bar any subsequent lawsuit by Respondents for trespass, \r\n  Respondents could file a separate suit despite the efficacy of the statute of \r\n  limitations.Â  Judge John reached this conclusion because he believed Judge Baxleyâ€™s \r\n  order granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend â€œprejudiced [Respondents] and led \r\n  them to believe their rights were protected and that it was not necessary to \r\n  file a separate action for their damages.â€Â  Judge John took judicial notice \r\n  that Appellant did not file a Rule 59(e) Motion to Alter of Amend a Judgment \r\n  regarding Judge Baxleyâ€™s order.\r\nOn June 24, 2002, Appellant filed a motion to alter \r\n  or amend.Â  On October 28, 2002, Judge John issued an amended order which reaffirmed \r\n  his prior ruling.Â  Appellant served a notice of appeal on November 27, 2002.Â  \r\n  At trial on December 9, 2002, Respondents received judgment in the amount of \r\n  $70,560.Â  On December 12, 2002, Respondents commenced a separate lawsuit against \r\n  Appellant and another defendant, Weaver Company, Inc., alleging trespass and \r\n  negligence.\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue \r\nNot Properly Before the Trial Court&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Judge John granted Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss, \r\nhe held Respondents could file a separate action for trespass despite the expiration \r\nof the statute of limitations.&nbsp; However, Judge John did not base this decision \r\non a ground Respondents raised.&nbsp; While Judge John relied on his belief that \r\nJudge Baxleyâ€™s order granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend prejudiced them, Respondents \r\nonly sought leave to refile on the basis that the statute was tolled on March \r\n13, 2000, the date they filed their initial counterclaim.&nbsp; Respondents attempt \r\nto argue in their brief that they raised the issue of prejudice in a letter written \r\nto Judge John.&nbsp; However, the letter only mentions Judge Baxleyâ€™s order: â€œAn \r\nOrder was issued by Judge Baxley on October 19, 2001 allowing [Respondents] to \r\namend their Answer and assert an additional claim of trespass.â€&nbsp; This sentence \r\ndoes not raise the issue of prejudice to Respondents from Judge Baxleyâ€™s order.&nbsp; \r\nIn fact, the sole reference Respondents make in the letter to tolling the statute \r\nof limitations is that â€œthe statute was tolled when [Respondents] initially brought \r\nthe counterclaim on March 13, 2000.â€&nbsp; Indubitably, Respondents made no claim \r\nfor relief based on Judge Baxleyâ€™s order.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   \r\nâ€œIt is an error of law for a court to decide a case on \r\n  a ground not before it.â€&nbsp; Griffin v. Capital Cash, 310 S.C. 288, \r\n  294, 423 S.E.2d 143, 147 (Ct. App. 1992); see Friedberg v. Goudeau, \r\n  279 S.C. 561, 562, 309 S.E.2d 758, 759 (1983) (reversing the grant of summary \r\n  judgment because the ground for summary judgment was not properly before the \r\n  trial court).&nbsp; A reversal is required when the trial courtâ€™s ruling exceeds \r\n  the limits and scope of the particular motion before it.&nbsp; Skinner v. \r\n  Skinner, 257 S.C. 544, 550, 186 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1972).&nbsp; Because we \r\n  decide Judge John granted Respondents relief on a ground they did not raise \r\n  or argue, it was error for him to rule the statute of limitations was tolled \r\n  as of the date of Judge Baxleyâ€™s order.   \r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Statute of Limitations\r\n  Assumptively reasoning that the statute \r\n    of limitations issue was properly before the trial court, the judge still \r\n    erred in determining the statute would not time-bar subsequent actions.Â  The \r\n    trial court rationalized that because Judge Baxleyâ€™s order led Respondents \r\n    to believe they did not need to file a separate action for trespass, the statute \r\n    of limitations was tolled as of the date of that order.Â  This is flawed argumentation \r\n    because Judge Baxleyâ€™s order merely allowed Respondents to amend their pleading \r\n    to assert additional damages for trespass.Â  The order did not address the \r\n    legal merits of the claim.Â  \r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Statutory and Case Law Application  \r\n  The statute of limitations for â€œan action for trespass \r\n    upon or damage to real propertyâ€ is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. 15-3-530 \r\n    (Supp. 2003).\r\n\r\n  A statute of limitations reduces the interval between the \r\n    accrual and commencement of a right of action to a fixed period, thereby putting \r\n    to rest claims after the passage of time.Â  See 51 Am.Jur.2d Limitations \r\n    on Actions Â§ 15 (1970); Nowlin v. General Tel. Co., 310 S.C. 183, \r\n    186, 426 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 1992), affâ€™d, 314 S.C. 352, \r\n    444 S.E.2d 508 (1994).Â  This procedural device operates as a defense to limit \r\n    the remedy available from an existing cause of action.Â  Langley v. Pierce, \r\n    313 S.C. 401, 438 S.E.2d 242 (1993) (citing Goad v. Celotex Corp., \r\n    831 F.2d 508, 511 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 487 \r\n    U.S. 1218, 108 S.Ct. 2871, 101 L.Ed.2d 906 (1988)).Â  Unless an action is commenced \r\n    before expiration of the limitations period, the plaintiffâ€™s claim is normally \r\n    barred.Â  See, e.g., McLain v. Ingram, 314 S.C. 359, 444 S.E.2d \r\n    512 (1994).\r\n\r\n  Blyth v. Marcus, 322 S.C. 150, 152-53, \r\n    470 S.E.2d 389, 390-91 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n\r\n  There is universal acceptance of the logic of Statutes \r\n    of Limitations that litigation must be brought within a reasonable time in \r\n    order that evidence be reasonably available and there be some end to litigation.Â  \r\n    Not only do such statutes apply to suits against the State but also to suits \r\n    brought by the State.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Webb v. Greenwood County, 229 S.C. 267, 276, 92 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1956).Â  \r\n    â€œ[S]tatutes are designed to promote justice by forcing parties to pursue a \r\n    case in a timely manner.Â  Parties should act before memories dim, evidence \r\n    grows stale or becomes nonexistent, or other people act in reliance on what \r\n    they believe is a settled state of public affairs.â€Â  State ex rel. Condon \r\n    v. City of Columbia, 339 S.C. 8, 19, 528 S.E.2d 408, 413-14 (2000).\r\n\r\n  Statutes of limitation evolved over time with definite \r\n    purposes in mind.Â  They protect people from being forced to defend themselves \r\n    against stale claims.Â  The statutes recognize that with the passage of time, \r\n    evidence becomes more difficult to obtain and is less reliable.Â  Physical \r\n    evidence is lost or destroyed, witnesses become impossible to locate, and \r\n    memories fade. With passing time, a defendant faces an increasingly difficult \r\n    task in formulating and mounting an effective defense. Additionally, statutes \r\n    of limitation encourage plaintiffs to initiate actions promptly while evidence \r\n    is fresh and a court will be able to judge more accurately.\r\n\r\n  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, \r\n    334 S.C. 150, 163-64, 511 S.E.2d 699, 706 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n  Statutes of limitations are not simply technicalities.Â  On \r\n    the contrary, they have long been respected as fundamental to a well-ordered \r\n    judicial system.Â  54 C.J.S. Limitations of Actions Â§ 2, at 16-17 (1989).Â  \r\n    Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \r\n    they stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote repose by giving security \r\n    and stability to human affairs.Â  51 Am.Jur.2d, Limitation of Actions \r\n    Â§ 18, at 603 (1970).Â  One purpose of a statute of limitations is â€œto relieve \r\n    the courts â€˜of the burden of trying stale claims when a plaintiff has slept \r\n    on his rights.â€™â€Â  McKinney v. CSX Transp., Inc., 298 S.C. 47, 49-50, \r\n    378 S.E.2d 69, 70 (Ct. App. 1989) (quoting Burnett v. New York Cent. R.R., \r\n    380 U.S. 424, 428, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 1054, 13 L.Ed.2d 941, 945 (1965)).Â  Another \r\n    purpose of a statute of limitations is to protect potential defendants from \r\n    protracted fear of litigation.Â  51 Am.Jur.2d Limitation of Actions \r\n    Â§ 17, at 602-03 (1970).\r\n\r\n  Moates v. Bobb, 322 S.C. 172, 176, 470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n    When an action is dismissed without prejudice, the statute of limitations \r\n    will bar another suit if the statute has run in the interim.Â  Davis v. Lunceford, \r\n    287 S.C. 242, 243, 335 S.E.2d 798, 799 (1985).\r\n    B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion to Amend  \r\n  Rule 15 (a) states \r\n    â€œa party may amend his pleading . . . by leave of court or by written consent \r\n    of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires \r\n    and does not prejudice any other party.â€Â  Rule 15 (a), SCRCP.Â  \r\n\r\n  Â â€œThe prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of notice that \r\n    the new issue is going to be tried, and a lack of opportunity to refute it.â€Â  \r\n    Pool v. Pool, 329 S.C. 324, 328-9, 494 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1998) (citing \r\n    Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly Assocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, \r\n    361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct.

Sigmon, 299 S.C. 464, 385 S.E.2d \r\n    835 (1989) provides helpful instruction regarding a trial judgeâ€™s proper treatment \r\n    of a motion to amend.Â  In Collins, a defendant moved to amend his answer \r\n    to add counterclaims and affirmative defenses.Â  The plaintiff contested the \r\n    motion, arguing the counterclaims were barred by res judicata.Â  \r\n    While the trial court held res judicata did not operate as a \r\n    bar, the supreme court reversed, finding the trial court erred by ruling on \r\n    the res judicata issue in the context of a motion to amend.Â  \r\n    Collins edifies:Â Â  \r\n\r\n  A motion to amend an Answer should be contested primarily \r\n    by procedural arguments, not arguments concerning the substance and merits \r\n    of the counterclaims and/or defenses proposed.Â  For example, one might argue \r\n    that it is too late in the case to allow an amendment, and that prejudice \r\n    would result from such an amendment.Â  Arguments going to the legal merits \r\n    of a proposed defense or counterclaim are better taken up in the context of \r\n    a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss or a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n    It follows that the trial judge should generally not consider these substantive \r\n    arguments at the mere amendment stage.\r\n\r\n  Id. at 466, 385 S.E.2d at 836.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Because Judge Baxleyâ€™s order \r\n    did not address the legal merits of the claim, it was impossible for his order \r\n    to prejudice Respondents.Â  Judge Baxleyâ€™s order was unrelated to whether Respondents \r\n    could plead a counterclaim in a condemnation action.Â  Judge Baxleyâ€™s order \r\n    allowed Respondents to amend their pleading.Â  That order did not lead Respondents \r\n    to believe they could file a counterclaim for trespass in this condemnation \r\n    action.Â  Respondents have conceded that a counterclaim for trespass may not \r\n    be brought in a condemnation action, but rather, must be brought in a separate \r\n    action.Â  However, Respondents still proceeded with asserting their counterclaim \r\n    in the condemnation action.Â  The trial court erred in holding the statute \r\n    of limitations was tolled on the date of Judge Baxleyâ€™s order.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Respondents acknowledge \r\n    that Judge Baxleyâ€™s order did not address the legal merits of their counterclaim.Â  \r\n    They proffer that because Appellant did not challenge Judge Baxleyâ€™s order, \r\n    it became the law of the case.Â  We disagree.Â  Although Appellant did not file \r\n    a Rule 59(e) motion, Appellant was not required to take this action because \r\n    the order was not a ruling regarding Respondentsâ€™ right to properly plead \r\n    a counterclaim in a condemnation action; it was only a ruling regarding notice \r\n    and opportunity to respond to the amendment.Â  Under Collins, Appellant \r\n    should not have challenged the merits at the amendment stage.Â  Applying Collins, \r\n    Appellant only had to file a Rule 12(b) motion, and that is precisely what \r\n    it did.Â  See id. at 466, 385 S.E.2d at 836.Â  If we were to accept \r\n    Respondentsâ€™ argument, a party would be required to appeal an order granting \r\n    a motion to amend each time the party wished to attack the merits of the amendment.Â  \r\n    This would, in effect, nullify the language in Rule 15(a), SCRCP, allowing \r\n    a party to plead in response to an amended pleading.Â  Thus, Judge Baxleyâ€™s \r\n    order was only the law of the case as to Respondentsâ€™ amendment to their counterclaim.Â  \r\n  \r\n  A pleading error by Respondents does not serve \r\n    as a justification for tolling the statute of limitations.Â  Respondents bear \r\n    the burden of protecting their claim from procedural bars and may not use \r\n    tolling to save their claim.Â  No rule or statute exists which tolls statute \r\n    of limitations periods based on improper pleadings.Â  Therefore, we reject \r\n    any argument that the statute of limitations was tolled when Respondents filed \r\n    their initial counterclaim on March 13, 2000.Â Â Â  \r\n     III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Waiver of Statute of Limitations\r\n  Appellant argues the trial court erred in holding \r\n    Appellant waived the statute of limitations defense by (1) waiting until after \r\n    the statute of limitations expired to file a motion to dismiss; and (2) failing \r\n    to file a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend Judge Baxleyâ€™s order.Â  \r\n  A party can waive \r\n    a statute of limitations defense.Â  McLendon v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n    Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 313 S.C. 525, 525-26, 443 S.E.2d 539, 540 \r\n    (1994).\r\n\r\n  Waiver is a question of fact \r\n    for the finder of fact.Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. \r\n    Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 415 S.E.2d 384 (1992).Â  Waiver is a voluntary and \r\n    intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.Â  Id. at \r\n    342-44, 415 S.E.2d at 387.Â  It may be expressed or implied by a partyâ€™s conduct, \r\n    and it may be applied to bar a party from relying on a statute of limitations \r\n    defense.Â  Mende v. Conway Hosp., Inc., 304 S.C. 313, 404 S.E.2d 33 \r\n    (1991).\r\n\r\n  Parker v. Parker, 313 \r\n    S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994).Â  â€œA simple voluntary relinquishment \r\n    of a right with knowledge of all the factsâ€”an expression of intention not \r\n    to demand a certain thing is sufficient to constitute a waiver.â€Â  South \r\n    Carolina Tax Commâ€™n v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 34, 40, 221 \r\n    S.E.2d 522, 524 (1975).Â  â€œWaiver of [the statute of] limitations may be shown \r\n    by words or conduct.Â  Thus, waiver may result from express agreement, . . \r\n    . from failure to claim the defense, or by any action or inaction manifestly \r\n    inconsistent with an intention to insist on the statute.â€Â  Mende, \r\n    304 S.C. at 315, 404 S.E.2d at 34 (quoting 54 C.J.S. Limitation of Actions \r\n    Â§ 22 at 52 (1987)) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n  Appellant did not waive the right to assert the \r\n    statute of limitations defense.Â  Appellant has challenged Respondentsâ€™ counterclaim \r\n    from the very beginning stages of this litigation. Prior to the expiration \r\n    of the statute of limitations, Appellant twice sought dismissal of the counterclaimâ€”in \r\n    its reply, as well as in a separate motion.Â  Appellant was not required to \r\n    file a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend Judge Baxleyâ€™s order because it \r\n    did not go to the legal merits of the claim.Â  Thus, Appellant did not waive \r\n    its right to assert the statute of limitations as a defense.\r\n  In their brief, Respondents concede Appellant \r\n    did not waive its right to assert the statute of limitations as a defense, \r\n    but argue that fact is immaterial because Judge John â€œcorrectly reconciled \r\n    the holding in Moody with the law of the case.â€Â  Respondents claim \r\n    Judge John correctly reconciled the Moody mandate with Judge Baxleyâ€™s \r\n    â€œunappealed law of the caseâ€ when he referred to Judge Baxleyâ€™s order and \r\n    allowed Respondents to continue with their new action.Â  Respondentsâ€™ contention \r\n    that it is immaterial that Appellant did not waive its right to assert the \r\n    statute of limitations fails in that Judge Baxleyâ€™s â€œlaw of the caseâ€ only \r\n    applied to Respondentsâ€™ amendment to their counterclaim and Judge John erred \r\n    in tolling the statute of limitations.\r\n     IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Negligence Cause of Action \r\n  In Respondentsâ€™ separate action against \r\n    Appellant and Weaver Company, Inc., they alleged a cause of action for trespass \r\n    and added a new cause of action for negligence.Â  Based on our adjudication \r\n    that the trespass cause of action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations, \r\n    we rule the negligence cause of action is time-barred.\r\n  CONCLUSIONÂ  \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the trial court erred \r\n    in tolling the statute of limitations.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial \r\n    court is \r\n  REVERSED.\r\n   HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3835","title":"State v.

[1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 27, 2001, at approximately 7:00 p.m., \r\n  deputies with the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department drove to the Days Inn \r\n  on Garnerâ€™s Ferry Road looking for a motel room reserved by Donald Williams, \r\n  a known local drug dealer, and held for â€œMr. Gill.â€Â  The officers set up surveillance \r\n  of the motel and observed Gilbert Bowie arrive around 9:00 p.m. in a Toyota \r\n  Tercel with Florida tags.Â  Bowie entered the lobby and informed the desk clerk: \r\n  â€œâ€˜Iâ€™m Mr. Gill, and you have a key for me.â€™â€Â  The clerk gave Bowie a key to \r\n  Room 215 and Bowie walked upstairs.\r\nAt about 9:10 p.m., two men in a Dodge truck with \r\n  Florida tags arrived at the motel.Â  The men were later identified as \r\n  Juan Poviones and Jose Barrocas.Â  Poviones and Barrocas checked into Room 309.Â  \r\n  Around 9:30 p.m., Bowie left in the Toyota and Poviones and Barrocas left in \r\n  the Dodge truck.Â  The three men traveled to Cedar Terrace Shopping Center.Â  \r\n  They stopped at Eckerd drugstore and a Substation II restaurant, located just \r\n  down the road from the motel. Â Poviones and Barrocas talked briefly to \r\n  Bowie in the parking lot of the Substation, but then split up and appeared to \r\n  not know each other.Â  All three men returned to the motel at the same time.Â  \r\n  Poviones and Barrocas walked to Room 309 and Bowie entered Room 215.Â  The officers \r\n  attempted surveillance of both rooms.Â  Although the door to Room 215 could not \r\n  be seen, the officers noticed Bowie going to and from the elevator toward Room \r\n  215.\r\nThe officers obtained search warrants for both \r\n  rooms after midnight.Â  Upon entering Room 309, the officers encountered Poviones \r\n  and Barrocas.Â  Further, in the search of Room 309, the officers found a black \r\n  duffel bag containing four yellow â€œbrick-likeâ€ packages of cocaine, totaling \r\n  3,978 grams.Â  The duffel bag looked exactly like a bag the officers had observed \r\n  Bowie carrying into the motel earlier that night.Â  The fingerprints on \r\n  the packages of cocaine matched Bowieâ€™s fingerprints.\r\nThe Richland County Grand Jury indicted Bowie for \r\n  trafficking in cocaine, 400 grams or more.Â  At trial, defense counsel moved \r\n  to suppress the cocaine seized from Room 309 because the affidavit to the search \r\n  warrant lacked probable cause.Â  The Circuit judge ruled: â€œ[A]fter considering \r\n  the two search warrants and their affidavits, . . . they are not on their face \r\n  insufficient.â€Â  The judge concluded: â€œSince based on the finding that the affidavits \r\n  and the warrants are not insufficient, then I would find that testimony could \r\n  be offered to supplement the affidavit.â€Â  The court further found â€œthere was \r\n  a good faith effort by the officer in communicating with his lieutenant to give \r\n  all the facts, and that the fact that the magistrate did not include all of \r\n  those in there, I donâ€™t think the warrant should be suppressed.â€\r\nThe jury found Bowie guilty of trafficking in cocaine, \r\n  400 grams or more.Â  He was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and a $200,000 \r\n  fine.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court \r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 592 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2004).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they \r\n  are clearly erroneous.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 5, 545 S.E.2d at 829; see \r\n  also Abdullah, 357 S.C. at 349, 592 S.E.2d at 347 (â€œOn appeal from \r\n  a suppression hearing, this court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  if any evidence supports the findings.â€).Â  This same standard of review applies \r\n  to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain \r\n  evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  \r\n  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his \r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State \r\n  v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 391 S.E.2d 244 (1990); see also State \r\n  v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000) (an abuse of discretion \r\n  is a conclusion with no reasonable factual support).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate \r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply \r\n  determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, \r\n  345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 \r\n  S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nAn appellate court reviewing the decision to issue a search \r\n  warrant should decide whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding \r\n  probable cause existed.Â  State v. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 583 S.E.2d 437 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003); State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002); see also State v. Keith, 356 S.C. 219, 588 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (noting that duty of reviewing court is to ensure that magistrate \r\n  had substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed).Â  This review, \r\n  like the determination by the magistrate, is governed by the â€œtotality of the \r\n  circumstancesâ€ test.Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 536 S.E.2d 675 (2000); \r\n  King, 349 S.C. at 148, 561 S.E.2d at 643.Â  The appellate court should \r\n  give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable cause.Â  State \r\n  v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997); State v. Driggers, \r\n  322 S.C. 506, 473 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1996); see also State v. Sullivan, \r\n  267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976) (magistrateâ€™s determination of probable \r\n  cause should be paid great deference by reviewing court).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  SEARCH WARRANT \r\n  AFFIDAVIT\r\nBowie argues the affidavit to the search warrant for Room \r\n  309 lacked probable cause.Â  He contends the trial judge erred in refusing to \r\n  suppress cocaine seized from that room.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe affidavit to the search warrant for Room 309 provided:\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY SOUGHT\r\n\r\nCocaine, paraphernalia and paperwork associated with the \r\n  sale, storage and use of cocaine.Â  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PREMISES (PERSON, PLACE OR THING) TO BE SEARCHED\r\n\r\n7300 SUMTER HWY, DAYS INN MOTEL ROOM 309.Â  THE LOCATION IS \r\n  A THREE STORY MOTEL LOCATED ACROSS THE STREET FROM SHONEYS ON SUMTER HWY.Â  THE \r\n  ROOM TO BE SEARCHED IS NUMBER 309 ON THE THIRD FLOOR ON THE FRONT SIDE.Â  SEARCH \r\n  TO INLCUDE ALL PERSONS IN OR ASSOCIATED WITH ROOM 309 AND A SILVER DODGE TRUCK \r\n  WITH FLORIDA REGISTRATION, T79XPH.\r\n\r\nREASON FOR AFFIANTâ€™S BELIEF THAT THE\r\nPROPERTY SOUGHT IS ON THE SUBJECT PREMISES\r\n\r\nThe Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department received information \r\n  on this date from a confidential and reliable informant that a subject named \r\n  â€œGillâ€ would arrive from Florida with a quantity of cocaine.Â  The information \r\n  was specific that the subject would arrive around 9pm and would ask for a key \r\n  to room 215, the location to be searched.Â  Surveillance was established at the \r\n  motel.Â  A subject driving a green Toyota with Florida registration, UO4BBE, \r\n  arrived at approximately 9PM, and identified himself and received the room key \r\n  to room 215.Â  The Toyota is registered to a Jesus Rodriguez who had a prior \r\n  arrest for narcotics.Â  The subject was followed from the location to several \r\n  businesses including a Eckerds and a sandwich shop on Garners Ferry Road.Â  Two \r\n  other subjects in a Dodge truck with Florida registration, T79XPH, were observed \r\n  meeting this first subject.Â  These subjects returned to the motel, parked in \r\n  the rear parking lot and entered through a rear door.Â  The motel confirmed that \r\n  these two subjects are in room 309, the location to be searched.Â  Based on the \r\n  observations of the agents these subjects were together and believed to be involved \r\n  in the trafficking of illegal narcotics.Â  The informant is reliable in \r\n  that it has provided information on at least one occasion that led to at least \r\n  one arrest and the seizure of a quantity of cocaine.Â  Based on the totality \r\n  of the information including the corroborating surveillance agents believe that \r\n  the subjects have a quantity of cocaine in their possession.Â  Through the affiantâ€™s \r\n  and other Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department Narcotic officers experience \r\n  in drug enforcement, it is known that subjects present at the scene of illegal \r\n  drug distribution and/or possession commonly have drugs in their possession \r\n  and/or stored and/or transported in their vehicles.\r\n\r\nA magistrate may issue a search warrant only upon \r\n  a finding of probable cause.Â  State v. Tench, 353 S.C. 531, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  314 (2003); State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997); State \r\n  v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThe South Carolina \r\n  General Assembly has enacted a requirement that search warrants may be issued \r\n  â€˜only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate . . . establishing the grounds \r\n  for the warrant.â€™â€Â  State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, \r\n  348 (1999) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985)).\r\nThe affidavit must contain sufficient underlying facts and \r\n  information upon which the magistrate may make a determination of probable cause.Â  \r\n  State v. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 583 S.E.2d 437 (Ct. App. 2003); State \r\n  v. Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 454 S.E.2d 905 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  For an affidavit \r\n  in support of a search warrant to show probable cause, it must state facts so \r\n  closely related to the time of the issuance of the warrant as to justify a finding \r\n  of probable cause at that time.Â  State v. Winborne, 273 S.C. 62, 254 \r\n  S.E.2d 297 (1979).Â  The magistrate should determine probable cause based on \r\n  all of the information available to the magistrate at the time the warrant was \r\n  issued.Â  State v. Driggers, 322 S.C. 506, 473 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1996); \r\n  State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 457 S.E.2d 616 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In determining \r\n  the validity of the warrant, a reviewing court may consider only information \r\n  brought to the magistrateâ€™s attention.Â  State v. Owen, 275 S.C. 586, \r\n  274 S.E.2d 510 (1981); State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522, 556 S.E.2d 706 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nTo determine probable cause, we look to the totality of the \r\n  circumstances test set forth in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983).Â  \r\n  The totality of the circumstances test establishes:\r\n\r\n[t]he task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a \r\n  practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth \r\n  in the affidavit before him, including the â€œveracityâ€ and â€œbasis of knowledgeâ€ \r\n  of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband \r\n  or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 238; see also State v. Jones, \r\n  342 S.C. 121, 536 S.E.2d 675 (2000) (stating that under totality of circumstances \r\n  test, reviewing court considers all circumstances, including status, basis of \r\n  knowledge, and veracity of informant, when determining whether or not probable \r\n  cause existed to issue search warrant).\r\nA magistrate must determine probable cause based \r\n  on all the information available to him at the time of issuance of the warrant.Â  \r\n  State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 372 S.E.2d 587 (1988).Â  Affidavits are \r\n  not meticulously drawn by lawyers, but are normally drafted by non-lawyers in \r\n  the haste of a criminal investigation, and should therefore be viewed in a common \r\n  sense and realistic fashion.Â  State v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d \r\n  621 (1976); Dupree, 354 S.C. at 683, 583 S.E.2d at 441.Â  Affidavits must \r\n  be judged on the facts presented and not on the precise wording used.Â  State \r\n  v. Viard, 276 S.C. 147, 276 S.E.2d 531 (1981).\r\nOur task is to decide whether the magistrate had a substantial \r\n  basis for concluding probable cause existed.Â  State v. Adolphe, 314 S.C. \r\n  89, 441 S.E.2d 832 (Ct. App. 1994); see also State v. 192 Coin-Operated \r\n  Video Game Machs., 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000) (finding that as \r\n  long as the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding a search would \r\n  uncover evidence of wrongdoing, the Fourth Amendment requires no more).Â  Probable \r\n  cause is a flexible, common-sense standard.Â  Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. \r\n  730 (1983).Â  The term â€œprobable causeâ€ does not import absolute certainty.Â  \r\n  State v. Bennett, 256 S.C. 234, 182 S.E.2d 291 (1971); State v. Arnold, \r\n  319 S.C. 256, 460 S.E.2d 403 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Instead, it â€œmerely requires \r\n  that the facts available to the officer would â€˜warrant a man of reasonable caution \r\n  in the beliefâ€™â€ that an offense has been committed and that the accused committed \r\n  it.Â  Brown, 460 U.S. at 742 (quoting Carroll v. United States, \r\n  267 U.S. 132, 162 (1925)).Â  Probable cause â€œdoes not demand any showing that \r\n  such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.â€Â  Brown, 460 \r\n  U.S. at 742.Â  In determining whether a search warrant should be issued, magistrates \r\n  are concerned with probabilities and not certainties.Â  Sullivan, 267 \r\n  S.C. at 617, 230 S.E.2d at 624.\r\nSearches based on warrants will be given judicial deference \r\n  to the extent that an otherwise marginal search may be justified if it meets \r\n  a realistic standard of probable cause.Â  Bennett, 256 S.C. at 241, 182 \r\n  S.E.2d at 294; Arnold, 319 S.C. at 260, 460 S.E.2d at 405.Â  A determination \r\n  of probable cause depends upon the totality of the circumstances.Â  State \r\n  v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 352 S.E.2d 483 (1987).\r\nThe magistrate made a practical, common-sense decision to \r\n  issue the search warrant for Room 309, given the facts in the affidavit that \r\n  another Florida car containing two other subjects met Bowie and returned to \r\n  the motel where he was staying and that the agents believed all the subjects \r\n  were together and involved in trafficking.Â  A logical interpretation of the \r\n  affidavit accompanying the search warrant in this case, and the deference which \r\n  must be accorded the magistrate, overcome any asserted deficiency.Â  Based on \r\n  the totality of the circumstances, we hold the affidavit provided the magistrate \r\n  with a substantial basis for finding probable cause to search Room 309.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the trial judge properly found the affidavit was not facially insufficient.\r\nII.Â  SWORN ORAL TESTIMONY\r\nEven if the search warrant affidavit was insufficient on \r\n  its face to establish probable cause, we nonetheless find the affidavit was \r\n  properly supplemented by sworn oral testimony.Â  The supplemental oral testimony \r\n  to the magistrate by Agent Michael Poole is curative.Â  Agent Poole, of the Richland \r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department, testified:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  [Y]ou ultimately were put under oath in order to swear \r\n  out the search warrants when Lieutenant Senn arrived?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir, I was put under oath.\r\nQ.Â  Agent Poole, if you would tell the Court what additional \r\n  sworn testimony you gave to Judge Davis in addition to what was contained inside \r\n  the affidavits for the search warrant for room 215, and more specifically, room \r\n  309?\r\nA.Â  After [Bowie] arrived and we realized that the other \r\n  two defendants in 309, that they appeared to be together, I relayed to him that \r\n  when they were around the motel they very distinctly acted like they did not \r\n  know each other, that they were not together.Â  But when we saw them at the Subway \r\n  and at the drug store they appeared to be together; that they were following \r\n  each other around, the truck would go first and the other car behind, everywhere \r\n  they went that they were obviously together, but they distinctly acted like \r\n  they were not together at the motel.\r\nQ.Â  Did you provide any information regarding when it was \r\n  they had arrived at the motel? \r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  I told him it appeared that he was supposed to \r\n  arrive at 9 oâ€™clock and Mr. Gill [Bowie] arrived right at 9 or a couple minutes \r\n  after.\r\nQ.Â  What about the other two individuals, is that when they \r\n  arrived?\r\nA.Â  No, right shortly after that. \r\nQ.Â  Do you recall whether you relayed that to the judge? \r\n\r\nA.Â  Yes, that they came in a few minutes later.\r\nQ.Â  Any other information besides what is contained inside \r\n  the affidavits for rooms 309 and 215, any other information that was provided \r\n  to Judge Davis regarding the probable cause surrounding room 309?\r\nA.Â  I think there was one point where [Bowie] appeared to \r\n  circle the parking lot later on before we had a warrant signed, like he was \r\n  just circling to make sure, it appeared to me, like things were safe. \r\nQ. In your talking with Judge Davis, did you at any point \r\n  in time communicate to him whether the three of them appeared to be there together?\r\nA. I told him in my opinion they appeared to be together \r\n  and they were deliberately trying to represent that they were not.\r\nQ. You were sworn at the judgeâ€™s office when you obtained \r\n  these search warrants?\r\nA. Yes, I was.\r\n\r\nSworn oral testimony to the magistrate may supplement a search \r\n  warrant insufficient in itself to establish probable cause.Â  State v. Johnson, \r\n  302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990); State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, \r\n  352 S.E.2d 471 (1987); State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522, 556 S.E.2d 706 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001); see also State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 675, 678-79 (2000) (â€œOral testimony may also be used in this state to \r\n  supplement search warrant affidavits which are facially insufficient to establish \r\n  probable cause.â€); State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 290, 494 S.E.2d 801, \r\n  802 (1997) (â€œA search warrant that is insufficient in itself to establish probable \r\n  cause may be supplemented by sworn oral testimony.â€); State v. Crane, \r\n  296 S.C. 336, 372 S.E.2d 587 (1988) (holding the magistrate should determine \r\n  probable cause based on all the information available to him at the time the \r\n  warrant is issued, including sworn oral testimony).\r\nAgent Pooleâ€™s supplemental oral testimony regarding Bowieâ€™s \r\n  interaction with Poviones and Barrocas, the two men staying in Room 309â€”specifically, \r\n  their traveling together to Eckerd and the Substation II, and their representation \r\n  in public of not knowing each otherâ€”bolsters the magistrateâ€™s finding of probable \r\n  cause and the trial courtâ€™s refusal to suppress the cocaine found in Room 309.\r\nIII.Â  REASONABLE \r\n  EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY/STANDING\r\nBowie asserts he has standing to argue â€œthere was no probable \r\n  cause to support the search of Room 309â€ even though Room 309 was not his room.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nFor the sake of clarity, we emphasize that the concept of \r\n  â€œstandingâ€ in the context of a Fourth Amendment challenge has been diminished \r\n  and is now encapsulated within a â€œreasonable expectation of privacyâ€ analysis.Â  \r\n  The United States Supreme Court has indicated a preference for an analysis focusing \r\n  on â€œthe extent of a particular defendantâ€™s rights under the Fourth Amendment, \r\n  rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined concept \r\n  of standing.â€Â  Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 139 (1978); see also \r\n  State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 76-77, 276 S.E.2d 163, 165 (1981) (â€œ[T]he \r\n  United States Supreme Court has recently shifted away from a â€˜standingâ€™ approach \r\n  to an inquiry focusing directly on the substantive issue of whether the claimant \r\n  possessed a â€˜legitimate expectation of privacyâ€™ in the area searched.â€).Â  â€œ[I]n \r\n  determining whether a defendant is able to show the violation of his (and not \r\n  someone elseâ€™s) Fourth Amendment rights, the definition of those rights is more \r\n  properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than \r\n  within that of standing.â€Â  Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998) \r\n  (internal quotations omitted).\r\nFourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some \r\n  other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.Â  See Rakas, \r\n  439 U.S. at 133-34; Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969); State \r\n  v. Missouri, 352 S.C. 121, 572 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, a person \r\n  seeking to have evidence suppressed based upon a Fourth Amendment violation \r\n  â€œmust establish that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violatedâ€ by the search \r\n  and seizure.Â  State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 114-15, 352 S.E.2d 471, \r\n  473 (1987) (citing United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83 (1980)); see \r\n  also Rakas, 439 U.S. at 138 (â€œâ€˜[R]ights assured by the Fourth Amendment \r\n  are personal rights, [which] . . . may be enforced by exclusion of evidence \r\n  only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search \r\n  and seizure.â€™â€).\r\nA defendant seeking to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment \r\n  grounds bears the burden of proving he had a reasonable expectation of privacy \r\n  in the area searched or the item seized.Â  United States v. Rusher, 966 \r\n  F.2d 868 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. \r\n  98 (1980) (declaring a legitimate expectation of privacy is necessary to trigger \r\n  Fourth Amendment protections); McKnight, 291 S.C. at 115, 352 S.E.2d \r\n  at 473 (stating defendant who seeks to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment \r\n  grounds must demonstrate he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in connection \r\n  with the searched premises in order to have standing to challenge the search); \r\n  State v. Miller, Op. No. 3784 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 26, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 83) (noting where one does not have an expectation of privacy, \r\n  he may not challenge the admission of evidence based on the violation of anotherâ€™s \r\n  right to privacy).Â  â€œA subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate if it \r\n  is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.â€Â  Minnesota v. \r\n  Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 95-96 (1990) (internal quotations omitted).Â  â€œ[I]n order \r\n  to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must demonstrate \r\n  that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and \r\n  that his expectation is reasonable; i.e., one that has a source outside of the \r\n  Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property \r\n  law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.â€Â  Carter, \r\n  525 U.S. at 88 (internal quotations omitted).Â  â€œ[C]apacity to claim the protection \r\n  of the Fourth Amendment depends . . . upon whether the person who claims the \r\n  protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded \r\n  place.â€Â  Rakas, 439 U.S. at 143.\r\nFor Bowie to establish a Fourth Amendment violation, he must \r\n  show a personal and legitimate expectation of privacy in Room 309.Â  See \r\n  Olson, 495 U.S. at 95-97; Rakas, 439 U.S. at 143-44; Missouri, \r\n  352 S.C. at 129-30, 572 S.E.2d at 470-71.Â  Poviones and Barrocas occupied Room \r\n  309, not Bowie.Â  Therefore, Bowie did not have a personal and legitimate expectation \r\n  of privacy in a room he did not even occupy.Â  The fact that Bowie had associates \r\n  staying in Room 309 is not enough to grant him an expectation of privacy in \r\n  that room.Â  See Missouri, 352 S.C. at 129-30, 572 S.E.2d at 471 \r\n  (holding defendant, who was an occasional overnight guest, had no expectation \r\n  of privacy in friendâ€™s apartment where he was merely a permittee on the premises \r\n  on the date in question).Â  Moreover, Bowieâ€™s duffel bag in Room 309 does not \r\n  confer an expectation of privacy.\r\nBowie does not have a REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY \r\n  to challenge the existence of probable cause in regard to the search of Room \r\n  309.\r\n Based on the foregoing, Bowieâ€™s \r\n  conviction and sentence are\r\n  \r\n\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3836","title":"State v.

Â Gillian \r\n  still possessed the handgun that afternoon.Â \r\nOn Saturday evening, Gillian attended various parties \r\n  in the Irmo and Chapin area.Â  Most of these parties were hosted by high school \r\n  students whose parents were out of town.Â  Around midnight, Gillian, Page \r\n  (an accomplice in the prior burglary), and several friends, most of whom had \r\n  been drinking, met at high school senior Michael Glennâ€™s home.Â  Shortly after \r\n  arriving at Glennâ€™s home, Gillian left this gathering to pick up his friend \r\n  Jason Ward.Â  Gillian, accompanied by Ward, returned to the party.Â  In \r\n  the early hours of Sunday morning, Gillian and Ward left the party without \r\n  Page and drove to the apartment of one of Wardâ€™s co-workers.\r\nAfter Gillian and Ward left the party, Page began acting \r\n  violently.Â  He was forcefully removed from the Glenn residence by two party \r\n  attendees.Â  Once he calmed down outside, Page asked the occupants if he could \r\n  reenter the residence and use the phone to secure a ride home.Â  Once inside \r\n  the home, Page telephoned Gillian and informed him of the previous altercation.Â  \r\n  About 5:00 a.m., Gillian received a cell phone call.Â  In response to the \r\n  call, Gillian declared to Ward: â€œJason, we got to go.Â  Somebody just got shot.Â  \r\n  We got to go.â€Â  Gillian and Ward returned to the party approximately ten minutes \r\n  after Gillian spoke with Page.\r\nUpon arriving at the Glenn residence, Gillian physically \r\n  attacked at least four of the younger party attendees and demanded to see the \r\n  two people who had thrown Page out of Glennâ€™s house.Â  Gillian slapped several \r\n  partygoers and head-butted one in the face, breaking his nose.Â  Gillian asked \r\n  the partygoers â€œwhy they jumped [Page] and just threatened to beat them up for \r\n  jumping his friend.â€Â  After questioning the boys who had earlier escorted \r\n  Page from the party and learning they had not seriously injured him, Gillian \r\n  turned his rage upon the much smaller Page for misleading him, severely beating \r\n  Page, who was â€œ[c]rying and trying to cover his face.â€Â \r\nAt this point, Ward, who had been sitting quietly at \r\n  the kitchen table, confronted Gillian about his behavior.Â  Ward stated: â€œWhy \r\n  are you messing with these kids, man? They are scared of you.Â  They donâ€™t want \r\n  to fight you. . . . [Q]uit picking on these little high school kids.â€Â  Gillian \r\n  â€œtold [Ward] that he was nothing and to shut up.â€Â  Gillian then directed his \r\n  intensified hostility toward his friend Ward, who calmly refused to fight Gillian \r\n  despite minutes of attempted instigation and taunting.Â  Ward eventually responded \r\n  to Gillianâ€™s threats by quickly punching him â€œonce or twiceâ€ and pinning him \r\n  to the floor in front of several party attendees.Â  After Gillian â€œagreed \r\n  . . . to calm down,â€ Ward allowed him to stand up, but the threats continued.Â  \r\n  Around 5:30 a.m., Ward agreed to leave the party with Gillian.Â  Ward said \r\n  to Gillian, â€œJust take me home.â€Â  As he left the Glenn residence, Gillian loudly \r\n  declared to several party guests, â€œYou will see this in the newspapers tomorrow.â€\r\nAround 6:30 a.m., residents of an area in close proximity \r\n  to the Boozer Shopping Center heard approximately four to five gunshots.Â  \r\n  Wardâ€™s body was found behind the shopping center at about 8:30 a.m. on January \r\n  28.Â  Ward had four bullet wounds to the head and one to the neck.Â  It \r\n  was later established the wounds were caused by â€œ.38-caliber copper-jacketed \r\n  bulletsâ€ identical to those purchased earlier by Gillian.Â  Markings on the four \r\n  recovered bullets were consistent with bullets fired from a .38 caliber handgun \r\n  manufactured by the â€œTaurusâ€ company, as well as seven other manufacturers.Â  \r\n  The murder weapon was never recovered.\r\nGillian arrived at his parentsâ€™ home around 8:30 a.m. \r\n  on Sunday morning and entered his brotherâ€™s bedroom.Â  While speaking to his \r\n  brother, he confessed he had â€œshot [Ward] several times.â€Â  Prior to Wardâ€™s murder, \r\n  Gillian had made comments to his cousin to the effect his music career would \r\n  benefit from the reputation gained by killing another.Â  According to Gillianâ€™s \r\n  cousin, Gillian earlier professed that â€œif he had killed someone, it would make \r\n  him realâ€ and he â€œthought if he killed someone, he could appeal to the rap-type \r\n  music crowd.â€Â  Around 9:00 a.m., Gillian walked over to his cousinâ€™s \r\n  house next door and entered his bedroom.Â  In a drunken stupor, Gillian told \r\n  his cousin he had killed someone, explaining that he lured the victim behind \r\n  the jewelry store he had once robbed under the guise of showing the victim how \r\n  he broke into the store.Â  Select members of Gillianâ€™s family and friends knew \r\n  of Gillianâ€™s robbery, months before, of several womenâ€™s â€œTag Heuerâ€ watches \r\n  from a jewelry store.Â  Dems Jewelry Store, in Boozer Shopping Center, had reported \r\n  a break-in and a resulting loss of thirty-four womenâ€™s â€œTag Heuerâ€ watches in \r\n  July of 2000.\r\nSteve Gillian was later arrested and indicted for the \r\n  murder of Jason Ward.Â  The jury found Gillian guilty of murder.Â  The judge sentenced \r\n  Gillian to life imprisonment without parole.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the trial court err in allowing evidence of \r\n  Gillianâ€™s two prior burglaries?\r\nII.Â  Did the trial court err in denying Gillian the \r\n  right to fully cross-examine witness Jeremiah Page as to the possible sentence \r\n  he was facing for first-degree burglary?\r\nIII.Â  Did the trial court err by refusing to admit \r\n  evidence of the attempted police ruse concerning â€œdoctoredâ€ photographs of Gillianâ€™s \r\n  car near the murder scene?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  EVIDENCE \r\n  OF PRIOR BURGLARIES\r\nGillian argues the trial court erred \r\n  in admitting evidence of his two prior burglaries.Â  Specifically, he maintains \r\n  â€œ[e]vidence of the other burglaries was not necessary to establish that [Gillian] \r\n  had possession of a gun at the time of the murder.â€Â  He contends the evidence \r\n  was admitted in violation of Rules 403 and 404(b), SCRE, and State v. Lyle, \r\n  125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes evidence of \r\n  a defendantâ€™s prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt \r\n  for the crime charged.Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  It is well established that evidence of other crimes or prior bad \r\n  acts is inadmissible to show criminal propensity or to demonstrate the accused \r\n  is a bad individual.Â  State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 \r\n  (1987); see also State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000) \r\n  (finding that evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to prove \r\n  bad character of defendant or that he acted in conformity therewith).\r\nHowever, evidence of other crimes is generally admissible \r\n  when it is necessary to establish a material fact or element of the crime charged.Â  \r\n  See Johnson, 293 S.C. at 324, 360 S.E.2d at 319; State v. Byers, \r\n  277 S.C. 176, 284 S.E.2d 360 (1981); State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, \r\n  561 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, such evidence is admissible when it tends \r\n  to establish (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; \r\n  (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so \r\n  related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the proof of the \r\n  other; or (5) the identity of the person charged with the present crime.Â  See \r\n  Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923); \r\n  see also Anderson v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 581 S.E.2d 834 (2003) \r\n  (explaining that Rule 404, the modern expression of the Lyle rule, excludes \r\n  evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts offered to prove character of person \r\n  in order to show action in conformity therewith; the rule creates an exception \r\n  when testimony is offered to show motive, identity, existence of common scheme \r\n  or plan, absence of mistake or accident, or intent).\r\nIf not the subject of a conviction, a prior bad act \r\n  must first be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Beck, 342 \r\n  S.C. at 135, 536 S.E.2d at 683.Â  The bad act must logically relate to the crime \r\n  with which the defendant has been charged.Â  Beck, 342 S.C. at 135, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d at 682-83; see also State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  578 (1999) (declaring that record must support logical relevance between prior \r\n  bad act and crime for which defendant is accused).Â  In making the determination \r\n  of whether evidence of prior bad acts is admissible, the trial court must gauge \r\n  its logical relevancy to the particular purpose for which it is sought to be \r\n  introduced.Â  See State v. Nix, 288 S.C. 492, 343 S.E.2d 627 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986).Â  If the prior bad act evidence is â€œlogically pertinent in that it \r\n  reasonably tends to prove a material fact in issue, it is not to be rejected \r\n  merely because it incidentally proves the defendant guilty of another crime.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 497, 343 S.E.2d at 630-31 (internal quotations omitted).Â  If there \r\n  is any evidence to support the admission of bad act evidence, the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Pagan, 357 S.C. at 143, 591 \r\n  S.E.2d at 652 (citing State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001)).\r\nEven if evidence of other crimes is admissible under \r\n  Rule 404(b), the trial judge must exclude the evidence if its probative value \r\n  is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  \r\n  State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); Beck, 342 \r\n  S.C. at 135-36, 536 S.E.2d at 683; see also Rule 403, SCRE (â€œAlthough \r\n  relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed \r\n  by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the \r\n  jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation \r\n  of cumulative evidence.â€).\r\nIn the case at bar, the State introduced \r\n  evidence of two prior burglaries committed by Gillian.\r\nA.Â  The \r\n  Lake House Burglary\r\nEvidence sufficiently relevant to \r\n  the possession of particular property later used in furtherance of criminal \r\n  activity is generally admissible to prove the identity of the accused in the \r\n  subsequent trial for those crimes, even when such evidence incidentally reflects \r\n  the defendantâ€™s guilt of a previous crime.Â  See State v. Southerland, \r\n  316 S.C. 377, 447 S.E.2d 862 (1994), overruled in part on other grounds by \r\n  State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995); State v. Nix, \r\n  288 S.C. 492, 343 S.E.2d 627 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nIn State v. Southerland, our Supreme \r\n  Court explicated:\r\n\r\nSoutherland contends that the trial judge erred by \r\n  allowing the State to introduce evidence that he stole the shotgun used to kill \r\n  Quinn from a trailer two weeks before the murder and that he traded the shotgun \r\n  for drugs the day after the murder.Â  We disagree.\r\n. . . .\r\n. . . [T]he introduction of the evidence at trial was \r\n  proper.Â  While evidence of other crimes is inadmissible to prove the bad character \r\n  of a defendant, it may be admissible when it tends to establish (1) motive, \r\n  (2) intent, (3) absence of mistake or accident, (4) a common scheme or plan, \r\n  or (5) identity.Â  State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 125, 410 S.E.2d 547, \r\n  551 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 993, 112 S.Ct. 1691, 118 L.Ed.2d 404 \r\n  (1992) (citing State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923)).Â  The \r\n  evidence showed that Southerland possessed a shotgun at the time of the murder, \r\n  that the shotgun was the type used to kill Quinn, and that Southerland disposed \r\n  of the shotgun after the murder.Â  This evidence established identity \r\n  and a common scheme.Â  Therefore, we find that the trial court properly admitted \r\n  the evidence.\r\n\r\nSoutherland, 316 S.C. at 382-83, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  at 866 (emphasis added).\r\nHere, evidence relating to Gillianâ€™s role in the burglary \r\n  of the lake house was properly admitted to show that the stolen gun, which was \r\n  in Gillianâ€™s possession, was consistent with the type of weapon that fired the \r\n  bullets recovered from Wardâ€™s body.Â  A .38 caliber â€œTaurusâ€ revolver was one \r\n  of the items stolen from the home.Â  Gillian obtained this revolver from his \r\n  burglary accomplices and placed it in the trunk of his car.Â  The fact that this \r\n  particular firearm was deemed compatible with the bullet wounds inflicted on \r\n  Ward was central to the Stateâ€™s case against Gillian.Â  Although the State presented \r\n  evidence Gillian possessed a gun and purchased .38 caliber ammunition, evidence \r\n  of the break-in and theft of that particular firearm was necessary to establish \r\n  the probative connection between the stolen handgun and the following facts: \r\n  (1) the victim was shot five times by a five-shot revolver; and (2) the recovered \r\n  bullets were consistent with those fired by a â€œTaurusâ€ revolver.Â  The evidence \r\n  of the prior burglary buttressed the testimony of the former gun owner and the \r\n  Stateâ€™s forensic expert.\r\nThe lake house burglary was necessarily admitted to \r\n  prove a material fact of the Stateâ€™s case for murder, that being Gillianâ€™s possession \r\n  of the particular firearm allegedly used in the murder of Ward.Â  Evidence of \r\n  this burglary was admissible as tending to establish Gillianâ€™s identity as perpetrator \r\n  of Wardâ€™s murder.Â  Gillianâ€™s commission of the lake house burglary was demonstrated \r\n  by clear and convincing proof.Â  Gillianâ€™s lake house burglary was properly admitted \r\n  as it had a clear â€œlogical relevanceâ€ to Gillianâ€™s possession of a firearm linked, \r\n  if only circumstantially, to the murder.Â  Therefore, the evidence was probative \r\n  as to the fundamental element of identity pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  See \r\n  State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (holding evidence \r\n  properly admitted when logical relevance existed between the evidence and an \r\n  element of the crime charged).\r\nB.Â  The \r\n  Dems Jewelry Store Burglary\r\nUpon visiting his cousin the morning \r\n  following the alleged murder, Gillian admitted to luring Ward to the area of \r\n  his prior jewelry store break-in.Â  Gillianâ€™s cousin testified:\r\n\r\nHe took him behind Dems, â€œThe jewelry store that I \r\n  had robbed,â€ is what he said.Â  He said, â€œI was going to kind of show him how \r\n  I robbed the place.Â  Instead I just shot him a couple of times and left him \r\n  there because I figured no one would find out because they did not find out \r\n  that I robbed the place.â€\r\n\r\nGillianâ€™s cousin understood these statements to refer \r\n  to Gillianâ€™s prior theft of womenâ€™s watches from Dems Jewelry Store.Â  About \r\n  six months prior to the murder, Dems reported a break-in and theft of thirty-four \r\n  womenâ€™s watches.Â  Wardâ€™s body was discovered behind Boozer Shopping Center, \r\n  the location of Dems Jewelry Store.\r\nThe evidence establishes a clear chain of \r\n  inferences indubitably relevant to the identity of Gillian as Wardâ€™s killer.Â  \r\n  Because the probative value of Gillianâ€™s confession to his cousin is severely \r\n  diminished without evidence of the prior jewelry store burglary, the evidence \r\n  was necessary to establish a key element of the crime charged, that being the \r\n  identity of Gillian as the guilty party.Â  See State v. Johnson, \r\n  293 S.C. 321, 324, 360 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1987) (â€œEvidence of other crimes is \r\n  . . . admissible . . . [if] necessary to establish a material fact or element \r\n  of the crime charged.â€).Â  The State presented clear and convincing evidence \r\n  that Gillian committed the Dems Jewelry Store burglary.\r\nThe trial court properly admitted evidence of the Dems \r\n  Jewelry Store burglary.Â  Evidence of Gillianâ€™s burglary of Dems Jewelry Store \r\n  was admissible as tending to establish Gillianâ€™s identity as Wardâ€™s murderer \r\n  pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\nC.Â  Res \r\n  Gestae\r\nThe admission of the evidence in regard to \r\n  the lake house and Dems Jewelry Store burglaries is proper under State v. \r\n  Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003):\r\n\r\nAdams contends the trial court erred in allowing the \r\n  admission of evidence regarding the theft of the cabinets because it amounted \r\n  to the prejudicial admission of a prior bad act.\r\nOur Supreme Court discussed the res gestae \r\n  theory in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996):\r\n  \r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of \r\n  evidence of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context \r\n  of the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so \r\n  intimately connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant \r\n  and is so much a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that \r\n  its proof is appropriate in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial \r\n  by proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense \r\n  is â€˜so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged \r\n  that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] \r\n  part of the res gestae of the crime charged.â€Â  And where evidence is admissible \r\n  to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, â€œ[t]here is no reason to \r\n  fragmentize the event under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€\r\n  \r\n\r\nId.  at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting United \r\n  States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980)).Â  Under the res \r\n  gestae theory, evidence of other bad acts may be an integral part of \r\n  the crime with which the defendant is charged or may be needed to aid the fact \r\n  finder in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.Â  State v. \r\n  Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001); State v. King, 334 S.C. \r\n  504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999).\r\nWe rule the testimony regarding the cabinets was admissible \r\n  under the res gestae theory.Â  The timing of the burglaries, and \r\n  what was taken from the model home in each one, were integral parts of the context \r\n  in which the crime was committed.Â  Thus, admission of the testimony regarding \r\n  the cabinets was necessary and relevant to a full presentation of the evidence.Â  \r\n  The trial court did not err in allowing the admission of the evidence under \r\n  the res gestae theory. . . . .\r\nAdams, 354 S.C. at 379-80, 580 S.E.2d at 794-95.\r\nIn the case sub judice, the \r\n  facts, modus operandi, and timing of the burglaries constitute \r\n  quintessential res gestae evidence.Â  Thus, admission of the testimony \r\n  regarding the two burglaries was necessary and relevant to a full presentation \r\n  of the evidence in this case.\r\nII.Â  JEREMIAH \r\n  PAGE/SENTENCING POSSIBILITIES\r\nA.Â  Confrontation \r\n  Clause/Rule 608(c), SCRE\r\nGillian asserts the trial court erred in denying his \r\n  request to cross-examine witness Jeremiah Page concerning the possible sentence \r\n  Page was facing for first-degree burglary.\r\nPage testified extensively at trial \r\n  as to the burglary of the lake house, Gillianâ€™s possession of the stolen revolver, \r\n  Gillianâ€™s statement that he was going to â€œdo some dirtâ€ with the weapon, and \r\n  the events at the Glenn residence.Â  On direct examination, Page admitted he \r\n  was currently charged with first-degree burglary and the Richland County solicitor \r\n  had agreed to advise his plea judge of his cooperation in Gillianâ€™s trial.Â  \r\n  On cross-examination, Gillianâ€™s defense counsel asked if the first-degree burglary \r\n  charge â€œcarries a sentence of 15 to life.â€Â  The Solicitor immediately objected.Â  \r\n  The objection was sustained and later questioning limited references to Pageâ€™s \r\n  possible sentence to â€œa lot of timeâ€ and â€œ[s]erious time.â€Â  Subsequently, Gillian \r\n  argued he should have been allowed to cross-examine Page as to the possible \r\n  sentence he was facing in order to show bias in his testimony.Â  Gillian declared: \r\n  â€œI would ask that the jury be informed that the sentence for burglary first \r\n  is a mandatory 15 to life, and itâ€™s a no-parole offense.â€Â  The judge held:\r\n\r\n[T]he problem with getting into specific sentences \r\n  is it can actually be misleading to the jury.\r\nThey may have the impression that he is facing 15 years \r\n  to life.Â  As you know, he is also facing the possibility of probation.Â  It just \r\n  depends on the circumstances.Â  \r\nSo that is why I have always stayed away from sentences, \r\n  specific sentences, on anything.Â  I think it always appropriate to say, â€œYou \r\n  are facing a lot of time,â€ or a long sentence or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees an accused the \r\n  right â€œto be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. \r\n  VI.Â  The right of confrontation is essential to a fair trial in that it promotes \r\n  reliability in criminal trials and insures that convictions will not result \r\n  from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.Â  California \r\n  v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970); State v. Martin, 292 S.C. 437, 357 \r\n  S.E.2d 21 (1987).Â  The Confrontation Clause requires a witness to testify under \r\n  oath and submit to cross-examination so that the jury can observe the witnessâ€™s \r\n  demeanor and assess his credibility.Â  State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. 351, \r\n  353 S.E.2d 451 (1987).\r\nThe Sixth Amendment rights to notice, confrontation, \r\n  and compulsory process guarantee that a criminal charge may be answered through \r\n  the calling and interrogation of favorable witnesses, the cross-examination \r\n  of adverse witnesses, and the orderly introduction of evidence.Â  See \r\n  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002); State v. Graham, \r\n  314 S.C. 383, 444 S.E.2d 525 (1994); State v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, \r\n  342 S.E.2d 401 (1986); see also Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 \r\n  (1965) (holding the Sixth Amendment applicable to the states through the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment).Â  Specifically included in a defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to \r\n  confront the witness is the right to meaningful cross-examination of adverse \r\n  witnesses.Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 552 S.E.2d 300 (2001); \r\n  Graham, 314 S.C. at 385, 444 S.E.2d at 527.Â  The Sixth Amendment essentially \r\n  â€œconstitutionalizesâ€ the right to present a defense in an adversary criminal \r\n  trial.Â  Schmidt, 288 S.C. at 303, 342 S.E.2d at 402.\r\nThe primary interest secured by the Confrontation Clause \r\n  of the Sixth Amendment is the right to cross-examination.Â  State v. Shuler, \r\n  344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001); Starnes v. State, 307 S.C. 247, \r\n  414 S.E.2d 582 (1991); see also Graham, 314 S.C. at 385, 444 S.E.2d \r\n  at 527 (specifically included in defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront \r\n  witness is right to meaningful cross-examination of adverse witnesses).Â  The \r\n  Confrontation Clause guarantees a defendant the opportunity to cross-examine \r\n  a witness concerning bias.Â  Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308 (1974); State \r\n  v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 399 S.E.2d 593 (1991); see also Mizzell, \r\n  349 S.C. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at 317 (defendant has right to cross-examine witness \r\n  concerning bias under Confrontation Clause).Â  Considerable latitude is allowed \r\n  in the cross-examination of a witness for potential bias.Â  State v. Clark, \r\n  315 S.C. 478, 445 S.E.2d 633 (1994); Brown, 303 S.C. at 171, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  at 594; State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 306 S.E.2d 611 (1983).Â  On \r\n  cross-examination, any fact may be elicited which tends to show interest, bias, \r\n  or partiality of the witness.Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at \r\n  317; State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000); State \r\n  v. Brewington, 267 S.C. 97, 226 S.E.2d 249 (1976).Â  The appropriate question \r\n  under a Confrontation Clause analysis is whether there has been any interference \r\n  with the defendantâ€™s opportunity for effective cross-examination at trial.Â  \r\n  Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730 (1987); Shuler, 344 S.C. at \r\n  624, 545 S.E.2d at 815; Starnes, 307 S.C. at 250, 414 S.E.2d at 583.\r\nA criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation \r\n  Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate \r\n  cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of \r\n  the witness, and thereby to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors could \r\n  appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.Â  Delaware \r\n  v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986).Â  The Confrontation Clause does not, \r\n  however, prevent a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counselâ€™s \r\n  inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness.Â  Id.Â  On the \r\n  contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause \r\n  is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on \r\n  concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the \r\n  issues, witnessâ€™ safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally \r\n  relevant.Â  Id.Â  Before a trial judge may limit a criminal defendantâ€™s \r\n  right to engage in cross-examination to show bias on the part of the witness, \r\n  the record must clearly show the cross-examination is inappropriate.Â  Mizzell, \r\n  349 S.C. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at 317.\r\nIn State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 558 \r\n  S.E.2d 518 (2002), the defendant appealed his murder conviction, claiming the \r\n  trial court erred by limiting his cross-examination of a State witness regarding \r\n  the witnessâ€™s pending charges.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nPrior to the Stateâ€™s witness, Michael Peterson, taking \r\n  the stand, defense counsel argued appellant should be allowed to ask Peterson \r\n  about his pending charges.Â  Defense counsel desired to question Peterson about \r\n  what the pending charges were to show bias under Rule 608(c), SCRE, because \r\n  Peterson had possibly been promised a deal in exchange for his testimony.Â  The \r\n  State responded there was no promised deal, but that Peterson had been told \r\n  when he went to trial on the charges, the State would tell the trial judge he \r\n  had cooperated by testifying in the instant case.Â  The trial court ruled defense \r\n  counsel could generally ask whether Peterson had pending charges and whether \r\n  there was anything promised him with regard to those pending charges.Â  However, \r\n  defense counsel was not allowed to question Peterson as to the crimes with which \r\n  he was charged.\r\nPetersonâ€™s pending charges were: (1) possession of \r\n  crack cocaine with intent to distribute (PWID); (2) PWID within proximity of \r\n  a school; (3) robbery, two counts; (4) first degree burglary; (5) grand larceny; \r\n  (6) malicious injury to real property, two counts; and (7) possession of a controlled \r\n  substance.Â  If convicted of the first degree burglary charge, Peterson was facing \r\n  a possible sentence of life imprisonment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(B) (Supp. \r\n  2000).\r\n. . . .\r\nOn cross, defense counsel questioned Peterson as to \r\n  what he expected to receive regarding his pending charges in exchange for his \r\n  testimony.Â  Defense counsel also questioned Peterson about his prior convictions.\r\n. . . .\r\nAppellant sought to expose Petersonâ€™s possible bias \r\n  and prejudice by asking Peterson what the crimes were with which he was charged.Â  \r\n  Because of the number of charges pending against Peterson and the severity of \r\n  the potential sentences, we find the evidence was probative on the issue of \r\n  bias and should have been admitted.Â  There was the substantial possibility Peterson \r\n  would give biased testimony in an effort to have the solicitor highlight to \r\n  his future trial judge how he had cooperated in the instant case.Â  The excluded \r\n  evidence had â€œa legitimate tendency to throw light on the accuracy, truthfulness, \r\n  and sincerityâ€ of Petersonâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, under these circumstances, \r\n  we find the trial court committed error under Rule 608(c) by improperly limiting \r\n  the scope of appellantâ€™s cross-examination.\r\n\r\nSims, 348 S.C. at 23-26, 558 S.E.2d at 522-23 \r\n  (citation omitted).\r\nThe Court, in State v. Mizzell, 349 \r\n  S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002), addressed a similar issue.Â  In Mizzell, \r\n  the defendants were charged with first-degree burglary, grand larceny and possession \r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Id. at 329, 563 \r\n  S.E.2d at 316.Â  During the trial, the Stateâ€™s key witness, Donald Steele, testified \r\n  he and his wife accompanied defendants to the burglarized home.Â  Id. \r\n  at 330, 563 S.E.2d at 317.Â  On cross-examination, Steele admitted the State \r\n  charged him with the same crimes as defendants.Â  Id.Â  The trial court \r\n  excluded evidence of the possible sentence Steele faced but permitted defendants \r\n  to examine Steele about the sentence in general terms.Â  Id.Â  A jury convicted \r\n  defendants of second degree burglary and grand larceny.Â  Id. at 329, \r\n  563 S.E.2d at 316.\r\nOn appeal, defendants argued the trial court \r\n  erred in violating their rights under the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s Confrontation Clause \r\n  by limiting the cross-examination of Steele.Â  Specifically, defendants asserted \r\n  the trial court should have permitted defense counsel to elicit from Steele \r\n  the possible punishment he could receive if he were convicted of the charged \r\n  crimes.Â  Our Supreme Court inculcated:\r\n\r\nThe trial judge prohibited questioning Steele about \r\n  a specific possible sentence because the charges against Steele and [defendants] \r\n  were the same.Â  â€œThe purpose of preventing disclosure of the potential sentence \r\n  facing the defendant is that such evidence is irrelevant to the jury and could \r\n  possibly prejudice the Stateâ€™s right to a fair trial.â€Â  Illinois v. Brewer, \r\n  245 Ill.App.3d 890, 185 Ill.Dec. 917, 615 N.E.2d 787, 790 (1993). . . . . \r\nThe jury is, generally, not entitled to learn the possible \r\n  sentence of a defendant because the sentence is irrelevant to finding guilt \r\n  or innocence.Â  However, other constitutional concerns, such as the Confrontation \r\n  Clause, limit the applicability of this rule in circumstances where the defendantâ€™s \r\n  right to effectively cross-examine a co-conspirator witness of possible bias \r\n  outweighs the need to exclude the evidence.\r\n. . . .\r\nThe case sub judice is distinctive because \r\n  the co-conspirator witness was charged with the same crimes as [defendants] \r\n  but had neither agreed to a plea bargain nor pled guilty.Â  [Defendants] assert \r\n  the State should not be allowed to rely on this distinction to exclude this \r\n  testimony because the absence of the agreement, if anything, suggests the witness \r\n  will testify more favorably to the Stateâ€™s position.Â  [Defendants] argue Steele \r\n  would reasonably have felt the quality of his cooperation would determine the \r\n  degree of benefit he would later receive.Â  See Boone v. Paderick, \r\n  541 F.2d 447, 451 (4th Cir. 1976) (â€œ[A] promise to recommend leniency (without \r\n  assurance of it) may be interpreted by the promisee as contingent upon the quality \r\n  of the evidence produced; the more uncertain the agreement, the greater the \r\n  incentive to make the testimony pleasing to the promisor.â€).Â  We agree.\r\n. . . .\r\nThe fact the witness has yet to reach a plea bargain \r\n  or been found guilty should not prevent the admission of such evidence.Â  The \r\n  lack of a negotiated plea, if anything, creates a situation where the witness \r\n  is more likely to engage in biased testimony in order to obtain a future recommendation \r\n  for leniency.Â  Accordingly, we conclude the Court of Appeals erred in holding \r\n  the trial judge properly excluded testimony concerning Steeleâ€™s potential sentence \r\n  if convicted of the same crimes as [defendants].\r\n\r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 331-33, 563 S.E.2d at 317-18.\r\nIncluded in the Confrontation Clause protection is \r\n  the right to cross-examine any Stateâ€™s witness as to possible sentences faced \r\n  when there exists â€œa substantial possibility [the witness] would give biased \r\n  testimony in an effort to have the solicitor highlight to [a] future [court]â€ \r\n  how the witness cooperated in the instant case.Â  See Sims, 348 \r\n  S.C. at 25, 558 S.E.2d at 523; see also Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 332-33, \r\n  563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in excluding evidence \r\n  concerning Pageâ€™s possible sentence.\r\nB.Â  Harmless \r\n  Error\r\nOur inquiry, however, does not end upon finding \r\n  the trial court committed an error in limiting the cross-examination of Page.Â  \r\n  â€œA violation of the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness \r\n  is not per se reversible errorâ€ if the â€œerror was harmless beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.â€Â  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d \r\n  315, 318 (2002) (quoting State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d \r\n  525, 527 (1994)) (internal quotations omitted).Â  This Court must determine whether \r\n  the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Graham, 314 S.C. at \r\n  385, 444 S.E.2d at 527.Â  No definite rule of law governs the finding that an \r\n  error was harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the \r\n  error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State \r\n  v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990); State v. Mitchell, \r\n  286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 \r\n  S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular \r\n  facts of each case and upon a host of factors, including:\r\n\r\nthe importance of the witnessâ€™ testimony in the prosecutionâ€™s \r\n  case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence \r\n  corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, \r\n  the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and of course the overall \r\n  strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.\r\n\r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318-19 \r\n  (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)).\r\nâ€œHarmless beyond a reasonable doubtâ€ means the reviewing \r\n  court can conclude the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319; Arnold v. State, \r\n  309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).Â  â€œIn determining whether an error is harmless, \r\n  the reviewing court must review the entire record to determine what effect the \r\n  error had on the verdict.â€Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319 \r\n  (internal quotations omitted).\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have \r\n  affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  893 (2003); Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. \r\n  Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Generally, appellate \r\n  courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting \r\n  the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State \r\n  v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial \r\n  error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been \r\n  conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion \r\n  can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); \r\n  Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795; see also State v. \r\n  Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (noting that when guilt is conclusively \r\n  proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be \r\n  reached, this Court will not set aside conviction for insubstantial errors not \r\n  affecting result).\r\nAlthough the Sims Court found the judge erred \r\n  by improperly limiting the scope of appellantâ€™s cross-examination, the Supreme \r\n  Court determined:\r\n\r\nHowever, the trial courtâ€™s error of limiting the scope \r\n  of appellantâ€™s cross-examination is harmless.Â  See State v. Mitchell, \r\n  286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985) (trial errors are harmless where they could \r\n  not reasonably have affected result of trial).Â  The Stateâ€™s case against appellant \r\n  was strong without resorting to Petersonâ€™s testimony. . . . .\r\nAccordingly, while the trial court erred \r\n  by limiting appellantâ€™s cross-examination of Peterson, the error was harmless \r\n  because the error could not reasonably have affected the result of trial.Â  See \r\n  State v. Mitchell, supra.\r\n\r\nState v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 26, 558 S.E.2d 518, \r\n  523-24 (2002).Â  In contrariety to Sims, the Mizzell Court concluded \r\n  the trial court committed reversible error:\r\n\r\nConsidering the Van Arsdall factors, we note \r\n  much of Steeleâ€™s testimony was either cumulative or corroborated by other witnesses. \r\n  . . . .\r\nCritically, however, Steele was the only witness to \r\n  testify as an eyewitness to [defendantsâ€™] burglary of the home.Â  The lack of \r\n  physical evidence placing [defendants] at the scene enhanced the importance \r\n  of Steeleâ€™s testimony.Â  As in [State v.] Brown, [303 S.C. 169, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  593 (1991),] the co-conspirator witness is the only link placing [defendants] \r\n  at the scene of the crime.\r\n. . . .\r\nBecause Steele was the only witness to directly link \r\n  [defendants] to the burglary, we cannot say the trial courtâ€™s error was harmless \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court committed prejudicial \r\n  error in limiting [defendantsâ€™] cross-examination into Steeleâ€™s possible sentence.\r\n\r\nState v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 334-35, 563 \r\n  S.E.2d 315, 319-20 (2002).Â  The case at bar is analogous to Sims.\r\nFirst, in the case against Gillian, the testimony \r\n  of Page was largely cumulative.Â  Other witnesses testified as to both the lake \r\n  house burglary and the events of the evening and early morning hours leading \r\n  up to the murder.Â  In fact, Gillianâ€™s vague statement that he intended to use \r\n  the gun to â€œ[d]o some dirtâ€ was the only evidence on record supported solely \r\n  by the testimony of Page.Â  Unlike Mizzell, the absence of this witnessâ€™ \r\n  testimony leaves no material point of the Stateâ€™s case uncorroborated or unsupported \r\n  by the testimony of other witnesses.\r\nSecond, even assuming the omission of Pageâ€™s \r\n  testimony, there remains, at the very least, abundant evidence upon which one \r\n  could find Gillian guilty of murder.Â  Gillian was in possession of a five-shot \r\n  revolver consistent with the handgun used to shoot Ward five times.Â  He stated \r\n  to an entire household of partygoers, as he was leaving with Ward (who had just \r\n  embarrassed him in front of several others), that they would â€œsee this in the \r\n  newspapers tomorrow.â€Â  Following the murder, Gillian confessed to his brother \r\n  that he had killed Ward.Â  In addition, he admitted to his cousin that he had \r\n  killed someone behind a jewelry store.Â  Concomitantly, while the trial court \r\n  erred by limiting Gillianâ€™s cross-examination of Page, the error was harmless \r\n  because it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  See \r\n  Sims, 348 S.C. at 26, 558 S.E.2d at 523-24; Mitchell, 286 S.C. \r\n  at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151.\r\nIII.Â  THE \r\n  POLICE RUSE\r\nGillian avers the trial court erred by refusing \r\n  to admit evidence of the attempted police ruse concerning â€œdoctoredâ€ photographs \r\n  of Gillianâ€™s car near the murder scene.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn testimony proffered outside of the juryâ€™s \r\n  presence, Lieutenant James Smith, an investigator with the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department, admitted police falsified aerial photographs â€œto make it appear \r\n  to be a satellite photograph showing the [d]efendantâ€™s vehicle at the rear of \r\n  Boozer Shopping Center at the time frame of the incident.â€Â  These falsified \r\n  photographs were used during Gillianâ€™s interrogation in an attempt to compel \r\n  a confession.Â  This ruse, however, failed to elicit the desired confession.Â  \r\n  Because the photographs did not compel any evidence or statements which were \r\n  used in the Stateâ€™s case, the trial court ruled all evidence of the ploy inadmissible.\r\nâ€œAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise \r\n  provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State \r\n  of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, or by other rules promulgated by the \r\n  Supreme Court of South Carolina.â€Â  Rule 402, SCRE; State v. Aleksey, \r\n  343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000); State v. Horton, Op. No. 3787 (S.C. \r\n  Ct. App. filed April 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 61).Â  â€œRelevant \r\n  evidenceâ€ is defined as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of \r\n  any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable \r\n  or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE; State \r\n  v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under Rule 401, \r\n  evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish \r\n  or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.Â  In re Corley, \r\n  353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 \r\n  S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. \r\n  377, 380, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991) (â€œEvidence is relevant if it tends to establish \r\n  or make more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or \r\n  indirectly bears.â€).Â  Yet, even relevant evidence may be excluded if its â€œprobative \r\n  value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion \r\n  of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of under delay, \r\n  waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403,\r\nSCRE.\r\nThe trial judge excluded the evidence based \r\n  on a mixed determination of its irrelevance and its probability of confusing \r\n  the jury on the issues of the case.Â  Because the ruse did not result \r\n  in a confession or incriminating statements, it was of questionable relevance \r\n  to the issue of Gillianâ€™s guilt and did not expose, as the record reflects, \r\n  any weakness in the Stateâ€™s case against Gillian.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the \r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 \r\n  S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s evidentiary rulings will not be \r\n  reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal \r\n  error which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Hamilton, \r\n  344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. Mansfield, 343 \r\n  S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nGillian misconstrues Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. \r\n  731 (1969), asserting that case holds that evidence of police investigation \r\n  tactics is always relevant in a criminal trial; therefore, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  exclusion was based on legal error.Â  We find this reliance misplaced.Â  Frazier \r\n  concerned a confession elicited by disingenuous investigation tactics.Â  The \r\n  United States Supreme Court briefly noted that evidence of the police investigation \r\n  was relevant and admissible to determine the voluntary nature of the confession.Â  \r\n  Frazier, 493 U.S. at 739.Â  Similarly, State v. Von Dohlen, 322 \r\n  S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996), reiterated the principle that a determination \r\n  of whether a confession was given voluntarily requires an examination of all \r\n  the circumstances surrounding the confession.Â  Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at \r\n  243, 471 S.E.2d at 694-95.Â  The subterfuge at issue elicited no confession or \r\n  incriminating statements.Â  Consequently, no issue arose as to whether a statement \r\n  was voluntarily given.Â  The exclusion of the evidence, based on Rules 401 and \r\n  403, SCRE, did not arise from any error of law.\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion or error of law.Â  The \r\n  trial judge acted within his discretion in excluding the evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Gillianâ€™s conviction \r\n  and sentence for murder are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3839","title":"QHG v.

Smith, Jr., both\r\nof Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  QHG of Lake City, Inc. d/b/a \r\n  Carolinas Hospital System of Lake City commenced this action against Dr. Karen \r\n  McCutcheon, alleging she breached an agreement that required her to either practice \r\n  medicine in the Lake City area or repay loans from the hospital that financed \r\n  McCutcheonâ€™s medical education.Â  McCutcheon appeals the special refereeâ€™s order \r\n  awarding judgment and prejudgment interest to QHG based on its claim of quantum \r\n  meruit.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 18, 1991, McCutcheon and Lower Florence \r\n  County Hospital entered into a written agreement whereby the hospital agreed \r\n  to provide loans to McCutcheon for payment of tuition and fees for her medical \r\n  school education.Â  Pursuant to this agreement, the hospital would forgive one \r\n  year of the loans for each year McCutcheon practiced medicine in the Lake City \r\n  area following her graduation from medical school.Â Â  In addition to loan forgiveness, \r\n  the hospital agreed to provide McCutcheon with financial assistance for setting \r\n  up her medical practice.Â  Â Â \r\nFrom August 1991 to December 1994, County \r\n  Hospital provided McCutcheon with $31,478.70 in loans for tuition, fees, and \r\n  books.Â  This amount was given to her over the course of eleven installments.Â  \r\n  While the first four installments were evidenced by promissory notes, no such \r\n  instruments were executed for the remaining seven installments. [1] Â  The four notes detail the repayment \r\n  obligation and accrual of interest in identical language, varying only as to \r\n  each installmentâ€™s principal and applicable interest rate.Â  For example, the \r\n  note dated August 19, 1991, contains the following language:\r\n\r\nFOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned promise (s) to pay to \r\n  Lower Florence County Hospital, or order, the principal sum of Three Thousand \r\n  Seven Hundred Ninety Five Dollars, with interest from date at the rate of nine \r\n  and one half (9 1/2) per annum on the unpaid balance until paid.Â  The said principal \r\n  and interest shall be payable at the office of Lower Florence County Hospital \r\n  in Lake City, South Carolina . . . payable in sixty (60) days from the date \r\n  of graduation of the undersigned or sixty (60) days that the undersigned ceases \r\n  to be a full time student in good standing provided however, this indebtedness \r\n  shall be deferred and forgiven upon compliance with the agreement between undersigned \r\n  and Lower Florence County Hospital dated August 19, 1991.  [2] \r\n\r\nIn 1995, McCutcheon graduated medical \r\n  school and began her residency program in Florence with McLeod Family Practice. \r\n  Â She left the residency program before completing it and contacted the \r\n  former administrator of the hospital who had negotiated the agreement with her.Â Â  \r\n  McCutcheon indicated that she was ready to begin practicing medicine, but did \r\n  not feel adequately prepared to practice alone in a hospital setting.Â Â  Rather, \r\n  she believed she needed more experience before beginning her own practice and \r\n  wanted somebody to mentor her or oversee her practice until she gained the necessary \r\n  experience.Â  Although the hospital offered McCutcheon an opportunity to take \r\n  over a practice in Timmonsville, South Carolina, McCutcheon declined the offer.Â Â  \r\n  Instead, in July 1997, McCutcheon began practicing medicine in Surfside Beach, \r\n  South Carolina, and has never practiced medicine in the Lake City area. \r\nOn August 6, 1999, QHG brought suit against \r\n  McCutcheon, asserting causes of action for breach of contract and quantum meruit.Â  \r\n  The parties agreed to refer the case to a special referee solely under the theory \r\n  of quantum meruit.Â  After a hearing, the special referee issued an order on \r\n  February 16, 2002, awarding judgment to QHG in the amount of $31,478.70 for \r\n  the outstanding principal, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $23,314.43. [3] Â Â  McCutcheon appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action in equity tried by the judge \r\n  alone, this Court can make findings of facts in accordance with our own view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  However, this does not require us to \r\n  ignore the fact that the special referee was in a better position to assess \r\n  the credibility of witnesses.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 \r\n  S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989); see Columbia Wholesale \r\n  Co. v.

Town of Batesburg, 183 S.C. 49, 55, 190 S.E. 120, \r\n  126 (1937)).Â  â€œ[Q]uantum meruit, quasi-contract, and implied by law contract \r\n  are equivalent terms for an equitable remedy.â€Â  Id. at 8, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  at 872.\r\nThe equitable doctrine of quantum meruit allows \r\n  an aggrieved party to recover for unjust enrichment.Â  Columbia Wholesale \r\n  Co., 312 S.C. at 261, 440 S.E.2d at 130.Â  To prevail on this theory, a plaintiff \r\n  must establish the following three elements:Â  (1) a benefit conferred by plaintiff \r\n  upon the defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) \r\n  retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable \r\n  for her to retain it without paying its value.Â  Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc., \r\n  341 S.C. at 8-9, 532 S.E.2d at 872.Â  \r\nA.\r\nMcCutcheon contends that QHG has not satisfied \r\n  the first element of quantum meruit because she never entered into an agreement \r\n  with that entity. Rather, McCutcheon asserts her agreement was with Lower Florence \r\n  County Hospital, and it was that entity and not QHG that provided her with the \r\n  medical school loans.  [4] \r\nBecause McCutcheon makes this argument for the \r\n  first time on appeal, it has not been properly preserved for our review.Â  See \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt \r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but \r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for \r\n  appellate review.â€); Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 17, 5 S.E.2d 187, \r\n  189 (1939) (â€œIn matters of appeal, so far as it appears, all that this Court \r\n  has ever required is that the questions presented for its decision must first \r\n  have been fairly and properly raised in the lower Court and passed upon by that \r\n  Court.â€).Â  \r\nB.\r\nMcCutcheon next asserts that the third element \r\n  of quantum meruit has not been satisfied â€œ[b]ecause QHG changed the agreement \r\n  between Lower Florence County Hospital and Dr. McCutcheon and prevented her \r\n  from fulfilling the agreement as it was contemplated in 1991.â€Â  Specifically, \r\n  McCutcheon argues that â€œ[n]ot only did Lower Florence County Hospital have the \r\n  obligation to set up a practice for Dr. McCutcheon or place her in an established \r\n  practice, it also had a duty to ensure her an income.â€Â  This argument is without \r\n  merit.\r\nNothing in the agreement obligated the hospital \r\n  to provide McCutcheon with employment within the hospital or to secure the same \r\n  for her elsewhere.Â  The following provision from the agreement details the full \r\n  extent of the hospitalâ€™s obligation to McCutcheon insofar as the establishment \r\n  of her medical practice is concerned:\r\n\r\nUpon completion of Internship or Residency, HOSPITAL agrees \r\n  to provide Physician certain financial aids to establish her medical practice.Â  \r\n  The scope of such aid will be determined by the usual custom at the time of \r\n  practice opening.\r\n\r\nBy its very terms, the agreement only promises to \r\n  provide McCutcheon with financial assistance for setting up her practice.Â  Nowhere \r\n  does the agreement state or even imply that the hospital promised to establish \r\n  McCutcheonâ€™s medical practice for her, nor does it guarantee her a certain income.Â  \r\n  Quite the opposite, in detailing the available avenues by which McCutcheon could \r\n  â€œfulfill medical practice obligations,â€ the agreement makes clear that the practice \r\n  of medicine in the Lake City area was how McCutcheon was to fulfill her end \r\n  of the deal rather than a guarantee made by the hospital.Â  Thus, the hospital \r\n  neither prevented her from fulfilling her half of the agreement nor engaged \r\n  in any other inequitable conduct.\r\nAccordingly, we find no error in the special \r\n  refereeâ€™s determination that it would be inequitable to allow McCutcheon to \r\n  retain the benefit of the hospitalâ€™s funding of her medical education where \r\n  she did not fulfill her part of the agreement.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Interest\r\nMcCutcheon argues the special referee erred in \r\n  awarding prejudgment interest in this case because prejudgment interest is not \r\n  available in a cause of action for quantum meruit.Â  \r\nA.\r\nAlthough our research does not reveal any South \r\n  Carolina cases that are directly on point, we believe our Supreme Court and \r\n  this Court have implicitly found that an award of prejudgment interest is permissible \r\n  in an action to recover under the theory of quantum meruit.Â  \r\nIn Anderson v. Purvis, our Supreme Court \r\n  discussed the rule in equity with respect to the allowance of interest.Â  Anderson \r\n  v. Purvis, 220 S.C. 259, 262, 67 S.E.2d 80, 81 (1951).Â  In discussing several \r\n  older cases, the Court stated:Â  \r\n\r\nâ€˜Upon demands bearing interest at law, the Court of Equity \r\n  is, it seems, bound to allow interest; but where the demand does not bear interest \r\n  at law, interest will or will not be allowed according to the equity of the \r\n  caseâ€™; and:Â  â€˜Upon demands not bearing interest at law, equity usually allows \r\n  interest, but may in its discretion withhold it.â€™Â  In the late case of Epworth \r\n  Orphanage v. Long, 207 S.C. 384, 36 S.E.2d 37, 50, it was said:Â  â€˜A wide \r\n  discretion is vested in the Courts in determining whether interest shall be \r\n  allowed in equity cases.â€™Â  And the following is from Gaskins v. Bonfils, \r\n  10 Cir., 79 F.2d 352, 356:Â  â€˜A court of equity may, in the exercise of its sound \r\n  discretion, allow interest upon equitable considerations even though it could \r\n  not be recovered at law.â€™\r\n\r\nAnderson, 220 S.C. at 262-63, 67 S.E.2d at 81 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â Â  \r\nIn terms of prejudgment interest, the \r\n  general rule is that it is not recoverable on an unliquidated claim in the absence \r\n  of agreement or statute.Â  Builders Transp., Inc. v. South Property &amp; \r\n  Cas. Ins. Guar. Assâ€™n, 307 S.C. 398, 406, 415 S.E.2d 419, 424 (Ct. App. \r\n  1992).Â  â€œThe law allows prejudgment interest on obligations to pay money from \r\n  the time when, either by agreement of the parties or operation of law, the payment \r\n  is demandable, if the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  \r\n  Babb v. Rothrock, 310 S.C. 350, 353, 426 S.E.2d 789, 791 (1993); see \r\n  Builders Transport, Inc., 307 S.C. at 406, 415 S.E.2d at 424 Â (â€œA claim \r\n  is liquidated if the sum claimed is certain or capable of being reduced to a \r\n  certainty.â€).Â  â€œThe proper test for determining whether prejudgment interest \r\n  may be awarded is whether or not the measure of recovery, not necessarily the \r\n  amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.â€Â  \r\n  Babb, 310 S.C. at 353, 426 S.E.2d at 791.\r\nSection 34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code of Laws provides the statutory basis for prejudgment interest.Â  This section \r\n  states:Â  â€œIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any \r\n  sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest \r\n  according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths \r\n  percent per annum.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A) (1987) (emphasis added).\r\nBecause the applicable statute and case \r\n  law do not exclude the award of prejudgment interest for a claim under the theory \r\n  of quantum meruit, it appears that our appellate courts have implicitly recognized \r\n  that such an award is permissible.Â  See, e.g., Okatie River, L.L.C. \r\n  v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C, 353 S.C. 327, 336-37, 577 S.E.2d 468, \r\n  473 (Ct. App. 2003) (affirming trial courtâ€™s award of damages and prejudgment \r\n  interest for recovery under quantum meruit/quasi-contract/implied by law); Stringer \r\n  Oil Co. v. Bobo, 320 S.C. 369, 372, 465 S.E.2d 366, 368 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (implicitly recognizing that prejudgment interest may be awarded pursuant to \r\n  claim based upon quantum meruit); Builders Transp., Inc., 307 S.C. at \r\n  406, 415 S.E.2d at 424 (recognizing general rule that prejudgment interest may \r\n  be awarded in claims for liquidated amounts). \r\nIn light of this precedent, we perceive no basis \r\n  upon which to deny prejudgment interest in a claim for quantum meruit.Â  Thus, \r\n  we hold that entitlement to prejudgment interest does not depend upon what theory \r\n  of recovery a plantiff chooses to proceed under, but rather, whether or not \r\n  the measure of recovery is fixed by the conditions existing at the time the \r\n  claim arose.\r\nOur decision is consistent with other jurisdictions.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Murdock v. Cohen, 762 P.2d 691, 693 (Colo. Ct. App. \r\n  1988) (finding attorney entitled to prejudgment interest on quantum meruit claim \r\n  based on state statutory provision); Peabody N.E., Inc. v. Town of Marshfield, \r\n  689 N.E.2d 774, 781-82 (Mass. 1998) (ruling construction company was entitled \r\n  to recover damages and prejudgment interest from town based on theory of quantum \r\n  meruit); Lucent Technologies, Inc. v. Mid-West Elec., Inc., 49 S.W.3d \r\n  236, 247 (Mo. Ct. App. 2001) (â€œOn principle there is no reason for denying interest \r\n  when the action is in quantum meruit and the claim is unliquidated in the sense \r\n  that the amount due is to be measured and determined by the standard of reasonable \r\n  value of the services.â€ (quoting Mid-West Engâ€™g Constr.

App. 1995) (â€œPrejudgment interest \r\n  is recoverable in a suit on quantum meruit, provided the measure of recovery \r\n  is fixed by the conditions existing at the time the injury is inflicted.â€); \r\n  but see Modern Builders, Inc. of Tacoma v. Manke, 615 P.2d 1332, \r\n  1339 (Wash. Ct. App. 1980) (â€œBy its very nature, an award of damages based upon \r\n  quantum meruit is not liquidated and is not readily ascertainable in the partiesâ€™ \r\n  contract.Â  Therefore, prejudgment interest may not be awarded when a labor and \r\n  materialmenâ€™s lien is set by quantum meruit.â€).\r\nTurning to the instant case, we find the litigation \r\n  relates to specific sums of money advanced by one party to another party, and, \r\n  thus, the measure of recovery is capable of being reduced to a certainty.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the special referee properly awarded prejudgment interest to QHG.\r\nB.\r\nIn an alternative argument, McCutcheon contends \r\n  the special refereeâ€™s calculation of prejudgment interest was in error.Â  She \r\n  asserts the special referee should not have used the note interest rates to \r\n  calculate the advancements evidenced by the promissory notes because QHG waived \r\n  any contract claim given it proceeded solely under the theory of quantum meruit.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, McCutcheon claims the prejudgment interest should not have accrued \r\n  until the agreement was breached.Â  \r\nIn determining the amount of interest owed, the \r\n  special referee calculated interest from the dates on which each of the eleven \r\n  loan installments were made.Â  For the installments evidenced by promissory notes, \r\n  the special referee applied the interest rates set forth by the terms of each \r\n  note.Â  The remaining installments were calculated at the statutory rate of 8.75 \r\n  percent.Â  \r\nAs to the four installments evidenced by promissory \r\n  notes, McCutcheonâ€™s indebtedness to the hospital included not only the original \r\n  principal amounts, but also the interest that accrued on the notes with each \r\n  passing day.Â  Because the special referee was determining amounts owed on four \r\n  duly executed interest-bearing financial instruments, he correctly calculated \r\n  interest in accordance with each noteâ€™s terms from their respective dates of \r\n  execution. \r\nIn contrast, the remaining seven loan advancements \r\n  were not evidenced by promissory notes, and therefore bore no interest through \r\n  their own effect.Â  Courts are allowed to affix prejudgment interest to obligations \r\n  to pay money only â€œfrom the time when payment is demandable.â€ Future Group, \r\n  II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 101, 478 S.E.2d 45, 51 (1996).Â  Here, payment \r\n  was not â€œdemandableâ€ before McCutcheon breached the terms of the agreement.Â  \r\n  Thus, the special referee erred in calculating the accrual of interest from \r\n  the date of each of the final seven loan advancements.Â  We reverse this portion \r\n  of the special refereeâ€™s order and find that prejudgment interest at the statutory \r\n  rate of 8.75 percent should have accrued from the date of McCutcheonâ€™s breach \r\n  of the agreement.Â  Because the record is unclear as to the exact date that McCutcheon \r\n  breached the agreement, we remand for the special referee to determine this \r\n  date and to calculate prejudgment interest accordingly.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Settlement\r\nFinally, McCutcheon asserts the special \r\n  referee improperly admitted into evidence a $250.00 check she sent to the hospital \r\n  in August of 1998.Â  The check, McCutcheon contends, was written as a part of \r\n  a settlement negotiation and should have been excluded under Rule 408, SCRE.\r\nBecause the law favors compromises, our appellate \r\n  courts have long held that testimony as to negotiations and offers to compromise \r\n  are inadmissible for proving liability.Â  Neal v. Clark, 199 S.C. 316, \r\n  19 S.E.2d 473 (1942); see Hunter v. Hyder, 236 S.C. 378, 387, \r\n  114 S.E.2d 493, 497 (1960) (â€œThis Court has held that compromises are favored \r\n  and evidence of an offer or attempt to compromise or settle a matter in dispute \r\n  cannot be given in evidence against the party by whom such offer or attempt \r\n  was made.â€).Â  This principle is now codified in Rule 408, SCRE:\r\n\r\nEvidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, \r\n  or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration \r\n  in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to \r\n  either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity \r\n  of the claim or its amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise \r\n  negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion \r\n  of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the \r\n  course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion \r\n  when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice \r\n  of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to \r\n  obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.\r\n\r\nRule 408, SCRE.\r\nIn the instant case, nothing in the record \r\n  suggests McCutcheon and the hospital had ever negotiated anything at the time \r\n  the check was written or that either party ever disputed whether McCutcheon \r\n  was bound to repay the loans.Â  As such, rather than sending the check in â€œan \r\n  attempt to curb further litigation,â€ the testimony at trial affords only the \r\n  conclusion that McCutcheon intended the check as her first payment on the loan.Â  \r\n  See Commerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; \r\n  Assocs., 347 S.C. 545, 558, 556 S.E.2d 718, 725 (Ct. App. 2001) (recognizing \r\n  correspondence appeared to establish a settlement relationship between the parties \r\n  given the letters presented â€œan attempt to curb further litigationâ€).Â  Nothing \r\n  in the rule against settlement testimony requires courts to exclude evidence \r\n  that a party tendered a sum mutually understood to be due.Â  Therefore, the special \r\n  referee committed no error in admitting McCutcheonâ€™s check.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the special refereeâ€™s \r\n  decision awarding QHG judgment and prejudgment interest under the theory of \r\n  quantum meruit.Â  We also find the special referee committed no error in admitting \r\n  McCutcheonâ€™s check into evidence.Â  Because the prejudgment interest on the seven \r\n  loan installments not evidenced by promissory notes should have been calculated \r\n  to accrue from the date of McCutcheonâ€™s breach, we reverse this portion of the \r\n  special refereeâ€™s order.Â  We remand for the special referee to determine the \r\n  exact date of the breach and to calculate prejudgment interest accordingly.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the judgment of the special referee is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Although the final seven installments under the agreement were not \r\n    evidenced by signed promissory notes, neither party disputes their existence. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  The December 18, 1991 note covered a principal of $3,160.00 at a \r\n    rate of 8.5 percent; the August 12, 1992 note covered a principal of $4,125.00 \r\n    at 6 percent; the December 4, 1992 covered a principal of $3,300.00 at 7 percent.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  The special referee also awarded QHG attorney fees. Â Subsequently, \r\n    McCutcheon filed a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, in which she challenged \r\n    the award of attorney fees.Â  By order dated April 12, 2002, the special referee \r\n    granted McCutcheonâ€™s motion, holding QHG was not entitled to attorney fees \r\n    given there was no contractual basis for the award.Â Â  There is, however, no \r\n    issue before us on appeal regarding attorney fees.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â  QHG is an affiliate of the Carolinas Hospital System, which operates \r\n    several healthcare facilities in South Carolina.Â  In June of 1995, QHG leased \r\n    the operation of the hospital from Lower Florence County Hospital. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3840","title":"Moore v.

[1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant, the sole proprietor of Mooreâ€™s Heating \r\n  and Air, received the majority of his business through subcontracting work for \r\n  Greeneâ€™s Heating and Air Conditioning, a business run by John Greene.Â  Two to \r\n  three months after beginning work as Mooreâ€™s Heating and Air, Appellant entered \r\n  into an arrangement with his brother, Respondent Craig Moore, whereby Appellant \r\n  subcontracted a portion of his work to Respondent.Â  Under this informal arrangement, \r\n  Appellant paid Respondent based on a percentage of business revenue, though \r\n  Respondent contributed no capital or assets to the business.Â  As explained by \r\n  Respondent, â€œI was self employed from Bobby, and Bobby was self employed from \r\n  [Greene].â€\r\nThe brothers conducted business in this manner \r\n  for some time until Greene, having decided to retire, approached Appellant about \r\n  selling Greeneâ€™s Heating and Air Conditioning to Appellant for $100,000.00.Â  \r\n  After discussing the possibility of a purchase with Greene, Appellant suggested \r\n  to Respondent that they become equal partners in the business, each contributing \r\n  fifty percent toward the businessâ€™s purchase price.Â  Respondent agreed to the \r\n  proposal, and the two planned to later draft a partnership agreement or form \r\n  a limited liability company.\r\nThe brothers executed a contract with Greene whereby \r\n  they agreed to purchase Greeneâ€™s Heating and Air Conditioning for $100,000.00.Â  \r\n  The brothers then spoke with a bank officer about obtaining a joint loan for \r\n  the purchase amount.Â  The loan application was not completed at this first meeting \r\n  with the bank officer.Â  To obtain the loan, the brothers had Paul Walker, an \r\n  accountant, draft a pro forma balance sheet projecting future profits of the \r\n  planned business.Â  According to Respondent, the brothers agreed they would each \r\n  be paid a salary of $800.00 per week.Â  From their projected salaries, Appellant \r\n  and Respondent would each be responsible for paying back their half of the $100,000.00 \r\n  loan.\r\nThree days after the bank visit, the plans of Appellant \r\n  and Respondent went awry when Appellant became frustrated with Respondentâ€™s \r\n  decision to leave for a weekend trip to Myrtle Beach while a job deadline loomed \r\n  nigh.Â  Upon Respondentâ€™s return, Appellant openly expressed his misgivings, \r\n  advising Respondent he no longer desired to be equal partners with him.Â  With \r\n  Respondent present, Appellant telephoned the bank and instructed the loan officer \r\n  to remove Respondentâ€™s name from the loan.Â  Respondent would accept no other \r\n  arrangement and advised Appellant he would become Appellantâ€™s competition.Â  \r\n  As a result of the disagreement, Respondent discontinued working for Mooreâ€™s \r\n  Heating and Air and began operating his own heating and air conditioning business.\r\nAppellant continued with the planned purchase of \r\n  Greeneâ€™s Heating and Air Conditioning, individually securing a loan for $100,000.00 \r\n  and executing a purchase agreement with Greene.Â  Respondent filed suit against \r\n  Appellant and Greene, alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.\r\nDuring direct examination of Walker, Respondent \r\n  sought to introduce the income projection Walker prepared for the brothersâ€™ \r\n  loan acquisition.Â  Appellant objected to the documentâ€™s admission on the grounds \r\n  of relevance.Â  The trial court overruled the objection, admitting the income \r\n  projection as Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit 2.Â  Similarly over Appellantâ€™s objection, \r\n  the trial court permitted Respondentâ€™s counsel to question Appellant on cross-examination \r\n  about Appellantâ€™s personal purchases and spending since the acquisition of Greeneâ€™s \r\n  Heating and Air Conditioning.\r\nAt the close of all evidence, Appellant moved for \r\n  directed verdict on both the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty \r\n  causes of action.Â  The trial court dismissed Respondentâ€™s breach of contract \r\n  theory but denied Appellantâ€™s motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty action.Â  \r\n  Before the court submitted the breach of fiduciary duty claim to the jury, Appellant \r\n  requested a jury charge that Respondent had a duty minimize his damages.Â  The \r\n  court refused to charge the jury as requested.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of Respondent \r\n  in the amount of $30,000.00 actual damages.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  FIDUCIARY DUTY\r\nA fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust and confidence \r\n  reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.Â  Ellis v. \r\n  Davidson, ___ S.C. ___, ___, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct.

Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  711, 715 (2003); Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 \r\n  (1992); SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v.

Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 483 \r\n  S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  To establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship, \r\n  the facts and circumstances must indicate the party reposing trust in another \r\n  has some foundation for believing the one so entrusted will act not in his own \r\n  behalf but in the interest of the party so reposing.Â  Burwell v. South Carolina \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 41, 340 S.E.2d 786, 790 (1986); Ellis, ___ \r\n  S.C. at ___, 595 S.E.2d at 822.Â  The evidence must show the entrusted party \r\n  actually accepted or induced the confidence placed in him.Â  Regions Bank, \r\n  354 S.C. at 671, 582 S.E.2d at 444; State v. Parris, 353 S.C. 582, 593, \r\n  578 S.E.2d 736, 742 (Ct. App. 2003); Brown, 326 S.C. at 423, 483 S.E.2d \r\n  at 484.\r\nâ€œParties in a fiduciary relationship must fully \r\n  disclose to each other all known information that is significant and material, \r\n  and when this duty to disclose is triggered, silence may constitute fraud.â€Â  \r\n  Ellie v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78,___, 594 S.E.2d 485, 497 (quoting Anthony \r\n  v. Padmar, Inc., 320 S.C. 436, 449, 465 S.E.2d 745, 752 (Ct. App. 1995)).Â  \r\n  Partners are fiduciaries to each other and their relationship is one of mutual \r\n  trust and confidence, imposing upon them requirements of loyalty, good faith \r\n  and fair dealing.Â  Redwend, 354 S.C. at 475, 581 S.E.2d at 505; Few \r\n  v. Few, 239 S.C. 321, 336, 122 S.E.2d 829, 836 (1961).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fiduciary relationship of partners is discussed in 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership \r\n  Â§ 420 (1987):\r\n  \r\nThe courts universally recognize the fiduciary relationship \r\n  of partners and impose on them obligations of the utmost good faith and integrity \r\n  in their dealings with one another in partnership affairs.Â  It is a fundamental \r\n  characteristic of partnership that the partnersâ€™ relationship is one of trust \r\n  and confidence when dealing with each other in partnership matters.\r\nPartners are held to a standard stricter than the morals \r\n  of the marketplace, and their fiduciary duties should be broadly construed, \r\n  connoting not mere honesty but the punctilio of honor most sensitive.Â  In all \r\n  matters connected with the partnership every partner is bound to act in a manner \r\n  not to obtain any advantage over his copartner in the partnership affairs by \r\n  the slightest misrepresentation, concealment, threat, or adverse pressure of \r\n  any kind.Â  A partner cannot act too quickly to protect his own financial position \r\n  at the expense of his partners, even in the absence of malice.\r\n  \r\n59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 420 (1987) (footnotes \r\n  omitted).\r\nSouth Carolina case law recognizes the fiduciary duty owed \r\n  between partners:\r\n  \r\nThe law holds each member of a partnership to the highest \r\n  degree of good faith in his dealings with reference to any matter which \r\n  concerns the business of the common engagement, and each partner, being the \r\n  agent of the firm, must be held to the same accountability as other trustees, \r\n  in all matters which affect the common interest.Â  The relationship of a partnership \r\n  is fiduciary in character and imposes on the members the obligation of refraining \r\n  from taking any advantage of one another by the slightest misrepresentation \r\n  or concealment.\r\n  \r\nLawson, 312 S.C. at 498-99, 435 S.E.2d at 857 (emphasis \r\n  added) (citations omitted); see also Edwards v. Johnson, 90 S.C. \r\n  90, 72 S.E. 638 (1911) (stating that each member of a partnership is held to \r\n  the highest degree of good faith in his dealings with reference to any matter \r\n  concerning the business of the common engagement, and each partner, being an \r\n  agent of the firm, must be held, during the existence of the relation, to the \r\n  same accountability as other trustees in all matters affecting the common interest).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nRedwend, 354 S.C. at 476-77, 581 S.E.2d at \r\n  505; accord Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 597-98, \r\n  538 S.E.2d 15, 24-25 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nWhether a fiduciary relationship exists between \r\n  two people is an equitable issue for the judge to decide.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson \r\n  Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458-59, 578 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003) (citing Island \r\n  Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 358 S.E.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1987)).Â  \r\n  However, the determination of a breach of a fiduciary relationship can be a \r\n  question for the jury.Â  Id.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDAMAGES/Lost Profit \r\n   \r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred \r\n  in submitting the breach of fiduciary duty claim to the jury because Respondent \r\n  failed to prove damages with reasonable certainty.Â  We disagree.\r\nOne standing in a fiduciary relationship with another \r\n  is subject to liability to the other for harm resulting from a breach of duty \r\n  imposed by the relation.Â  In a breach of fiduciary case, the plaintiff is entitled \r\n  to damages for harm caused by the breach of a fiduciary duty owed to him or \r\n  her.Â  Damages in an action for breach of a fiduciary duty are those proximately \r\n  resulting from the wrongful conduct of the defendant.\r\n\r\nâ€œProfitsâ€ have been defined as â€œthe net pecuniary gain from \r\n  a transaction, the gross pecuniary gains diminished by the cost of obtaining \r\n  them.â€Â  Restatement of Contracts Â§ 331, Comment B (1932); see Mali \r\n  v. Odom, 295 S.C. 78, 367 S.E.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1988) (defining â€œprofitsâ€ \r\n  as the net of income over expenditures during a given period).\r\n\r\nÂ Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Assocs., 296 \r\n  S.C. 207, 210, 371 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1988).\r\nThe case of Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe \r\n  Assocs. articulates the standard of proof for proving lost profits:Â  \r\n\r\nThe same standards that have for years governed lost profits \r\n  awards in South Carolina will apply with equal force to cases where damages \r\n  are sought for a new business or enterprise.Â  First, profits must have been \r\n  prevented or lost â€œas a natural consequence ofâ€ the breach of contract.\r\n\r\n  The second requirement is foreseeability; a breaching party is liable for those \r\n  damages, including lost profits, â€œwhich may reasonably be supposed to have been \r\n  within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made as \r\n  a probable result of the breach of it.â€\r\n\r\n  The crucial requirement in lost profits determinations is that they be established \r\n  with reasonable certainty, for recovery cannot be had for profits that are conjectural \r\n  or speculative.Â  The proof must pass the realm of conjecture, speculation, or \r\n  opinion not founded on facts, and must consist of actual facts from which a \r\n  reasonably accurate conclusion regarding the cause and the amount of the loss \r\n  can be logically and rationally drawn.\r\n\r\nDrews, 296 S.C. at 213, 371 S.E.2d at 535-36 \r\n  (internal citations and quotations omitted); see Beck v. Clarkson, \r\n  300 S.C. 293, 298, 287 S.E.2d 681, 684 (Ct. App. 1989) (citing the factors in \r\n  Drews).Â  \r\nThe requirement to establish lost profits \r\n  with â€œreasonable certaintyâ€ permits â€œan inherent flexibility facilitating the \r\n  just assessment of profits lost to a new business due to contractual breach.â€Â  \r\n  Drews, 296 S.C. at 214, 371 S.E.2d at 536.Â  \r\n\r\nNumerous proof techniques have been discussed and accepted \r\n  in different factual scenarios.Â  See e.g, Upjohn v. Rachelle Laboratories, \r\n  Inc., 661 F.2d 1105, 1114 (6th Cir. 1981) (proof of future lost \r\n  profits based on marketing forecasts by employees specializing in economic forecasting); \r\n  Petty v. Weyerhaeuser Co., supra (skating rinkâ€™s projected revenues \r\n  compared to those of another arena in a nearby town); see also Restatement \r\n  (Second) of Contracts, Â§ 352, at 146 (1981) (proof of lost profits â€œmay \r\n  be established with reasonable certainty with the aid of expert testimony, economic \r\n  and financial data, market surveys and analyses, business records of similar \r\n  enterprises, and the like.â€); Note, supra, 48 Ohio St. L.J. at \r\n  872-3 (means of proving prospective profits include (1) â€œyardstickâ€ method of \r\n  comparison with profit performance of business similar in size, nature, and \r\n  location; (2) comparison with profit history of plaintiffâ€™s successor, where \r\n  applicable; (3) comparison of similar businesses owned by plaintiff himself, \r\n  and (4) use of economic and financial data and expert testimony).\r\n\r\nDrews, 296 S.C. at 213-14, 371 S.E.2d at \r\n  536.Â  \r\n\r\nProof may be established through expert testimony, economic \r\n  and financial data, market surveys and analyses, business records of similar \r\n  enterprises, comparison with profit performance of businesses similar in size, \r\n  nature and location, comparison with profit history of plaintiffâ€™s successor, \r\n  comparison of similar businesses owned by plaintiff himself, and use of economic \r\n  and financial data and expert testimony.\r\n\r\nGlobal Prot. Corp. v. Halbersberg, 332 S.C. \r\n  149, 158, 503 S.E.2d 483, 487 (citing Drews, 296 S.C. at 213-14, 371 \r\n  S.E.2d at 536).Â  The standard for proving lost profits complies with the general \r\n  rule for recovery of damages, which mandates that the fact finder determine \r\n  the amount of damages with reasonable certainty from the evidence.Â  Minter \r\n  v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 528, 473 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The \r\n  amount of damages cannot be left to conjecture, guess, or speculation; however, \r\n  mathematical certainty is not required.Â  Id.; see Yadkin Brick \r\n  Co. v. Materials Recovery Co., 339 S.C. 640, 646, 529 S.E.2d 764, 767 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000) (â€œThe amount of damages need not be proved with mathematical certainty.Â  \r\n  The evidence, however, should be such that a court or jury can reasonably determine \r\n  an appropriate amount.â€); Minter, 322 S.C. at 528, 473 S.E.2d at 70 (â€œWhile \r\n  proof of mathematical certainty is not required, the amount of damages cannot \r\n  be left to conjecture, guess, or speculation.â€).Â  Case law in South Carolina \r\n  has defined â€œreasonable certainty:â€\r\n\r\nTo warrant such recovery, loss of profits must be established \r\n  with reasonable certainty, for recovery cannot be had for profits that are conjectural \r\n  or speculative.Â  But it must be borne in mind that since profits are prospective \r\n  they must, to some extent, be uncertain and problematical, and so, on that account \r\n  or on account of the difficulties in the way of proof, a person complaining \r\n  of breach of contract cannot be deprived of all remedy, and uncertainty merely \r\n  as to the amount of profits that would have been made does not prevent a recovery.Â  \r\n  The law does not require absolute certainty of data upon which lost profits \r\n  are to be estimated, but all that is required is such reasonable certainty that \r\n  damages may not be based wholly upon speculation and conjecture, and it is sufficient \r\n  if there is a certain standard or fixed method by which profits sought to be \r\n  recovered may be estimated and determined with a fair degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nBeck, 300 S.C. at 298-99, 387 S.E.2d at 684 (quoting \r\n  South Carolina Fin. Corp. of Anderson v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. \r\n  109, 122-23, 133 S.E.2d 329, 336 (1960)).\r\nThe fact that the business is new does not prohibit \r\n  lost profits from being recovered.Â  Beck, 300 S.C. at 297-98, 287 S.E.2d \r\n  at 683.Â  It only is to be considered as a matter of â€œevidentiary sufficiency \r\n  rather than an automatic bar to recovery.â€Â  Id.; see Drews, \r\n  296 S.C. at 211, 371 S.E.2d at 534 (â€œCourts are now taking the position that \r\n  the distinction between established businesses and new ones is a distinction \r\n  that goes to the weight of the evidence and not a rule that automatically precludes \r\n  recovery of profits by a new business.â€) (quoting D. Dobbs, HANDBOOK ON THE \r\n  LAW OF REMEDIES, Â§ 3.3, at 155 (1973)).Â Â  Reviewing the factors in Drews, \r\n  the supreme court affirmed the masterâ€™s findings in South Carolina Fed. Sav. \r\n  Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 310 S.C. 232, 423 S.E.2d 114 (1992), where \r\n  the master awarded the developer of a proposed condominium complex lost profits.Â  \r\n  The master found that had the builder timely performed, the developer would \r\n  have realized a profit.Â  Id. at 236, 423 S.E.2d at 116.Â  The master correctly \r\n  determined lost profits were established with reasonable certainty from the \r\n  pre-sold sales, anticipated sales, and expenses.Â  Id.Â  In Sterling \r\n  Development Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 421 S.E.2d 402 (1992), the supreme \r\n  court affirmed the award of lost profits to a real estate purchaser because \r\n  of the sellerâ€™s breach of the real estate sale contract.Â  The purchaser planned \r\n  to develop a shopping center and already had a lease agreement with BiLo.Â  Id. \r\n  at 242, 421 S.E.2d at 405.Â  The court found that but for the sellerâ€™s breach, \r\n  the lease agreement between the purchaser and BiLo would still be in effect; \r\n  and, therefore, the purchaser proved lost profits with reasonable certainty.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nIn Drews, our supreme court addressed the standard \r\n  of proof required in a cause of action for breach of contract where the exclusive \r\n  measure of damages was lost profit.Â  Id.Â Â  Unlike Drews, however, \r\n  the claim submitted to the jury in the instant case was for breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty rather than breach of contract.Â  Because a cause of action for breach of \r\n  fiduciary duty sounds in tort rather than in contract, the two claims are not \r\n  marked by fungible damage measures.Â  As a consequence, although compensation \r\n  for the tort may include lost profit, other measures of damages are also available \r\n  that are not likewise available in contract.Â  Indeed, the evidence introduced \r\n  at trial demonstrated Respondentâ€™s loss could also be measured by the assets \r\n  he would have had an interest in but for Appellantâ€™s breach and opportunity \r\n  cost in terms of the projected value of the planned business.\r\nThe jury in this case returned a general verdict \r\n  for Respondent in the amount of $30,000.00.Â  Appellant did not request the trial \r\n  court to submit a special verdict form to determine whether the actual damages \r\n  were for lost profit or some other measure.Â  Without a special verdict form, \r\n  we cannot speculate as to what portion of the award the jury attributed to lost \r\n  profit as opposed to other tort damages.Â  Accordingly, the trial court committed \r\n  no error in submitting the claim to the jury. \r\nIII. PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENT\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit 2 on the basis the projected income statement was irrelevant \r\n  to any issue in dispute.Â  Although Appellantâ€™s argument to this Court includes \r\n  assertions the exhibit was â€œspeculative [and] lacked proper foundation,â€ the \r\n  only basis for the objection offered at trial was to the exhibitâ€™s relevance.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the exhibitâ€™s relevance is the only issue Appellant has preserved \r\n  for appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, the admission of evidence is \r\n  a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Gamble v. \r\n  Intâ€™l Paper Corp. of South Carolina, 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, \r\n  441 (1996); Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 \r\n  (1989); R&amp;G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 \r\n  S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal, therefore, this \r\n  court will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s evidentiary rulings absent a clear abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Hofer; R&amp;G Constr., Inc., 343 S.C. at 439, \r\n  540 S.E.2d at 121.Â  â€œFor this court to reverse a case based on the admission \r\n  of evidence, both error and prejudice must be shown.â€Â  Stevens v. Allen, \r\n  336 S.C. 439, 448, 520 S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Timmons v. \r\n  South Carolina Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970)).Â  \r\n  The trial judge has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence, \r\n  and his decision to admit or reject evidence will not be reversed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. \r\n  361, 365, 429 S.E.2d 190, 192 (1993); Davis v. Taylor, 340 S.C. 150, \r\n  155, 530 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 2000); Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of \r\n  Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 108, 498 S.E.2d 395, 404 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nAll that is required for evidence to be relevant \r\n  is that it have â€œany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence \r\n  to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would \r\n  be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE; see Davis, 340 S.C. \r\n  at 155, 530 S.E.2d at 387 (quoting Rule 401, SCRE).Â  â€œAll relevant evidence \r\n  is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United \r\n  States, the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, \r\n  or by other rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.Â  Evidence \r\n  which is not relevant is not admissible.â€Â  Rule 402, SCRE; see Pike \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 332 S.C. 605, 613, 506 S.E.2d 516, 520 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative \r\n  value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion \r\n  of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, \r\n  waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.Â  This threshold requirement is satisfied here.Â  First, the projected income \r\n  statement tended to prove the businessâ€™s earning potential, a matter relevant \r\n  to the calculation of damages.Â  Moreover, the exhibit was independently probative \r\n  in that it tangibly demonstrated the brothers had done more than merely discuss \r\n  the possibility of a partnership, but had actually begun working together in \r\n  furtherance of the planned business.Â  Thus, even if speculative, the projected \r\n  income statement is still admissible as relevant evidence that there was, in \r\n  fact, a working partnership between the brothers.Â  Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  did not err in admitting the exhibit into evidence.\r\nIV.Â  Personal Purchases Testimony\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  testimony about personal purchases Appellant made after purchasing Greeneâ€™s \r\n  Heating and Air Conditioning.Â  We disagree.\r\nBecause Appellantâ€™s business was a sole proprietorship, \r\n  he and his business were not distinct entities.Â  Appellantâ€™s own testimony illustrates \r\n  his cognizance of the mutual identity: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         Now, did Moore Heating and Air file a separate tax \r\n  return at the end of the year?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         No.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         How did Moore report earnings for taxesâ€”Mooreâ€™s Heating \r\n  and Air?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         I was the business.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAs a sole proprietor, just as his personal income \r\n  and the businessâ€™s income are the same, Appellantâ€™s personal expenditures are \r\n  probative as to his businessâ€™s financial viability.Â  When Appellant twice testified \r\n  his business lost money during the first year of operation, Respondentâ€™s inquiry \r\n  into Appellantâ€™s personal purchases over the same period was a legitimate method \r\n  of rebutting Appellantâ€™s assertion.Â  As such, nothing indicates the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in allowing the questions.\r\nV.&nbsp; Partnership\r\nAppellant avers the trial court erred \r\n  in submitting the case to the jury on the breach of fiduciary duty claim because \r\n  evidence of a partnership was lacking and because Respondent abandoned the proposed \r\n  partnership.Â  \r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict, the \r\n  trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motion.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, \r\n  518 S.E.2d 591, 597 (1999); Strange v. S.C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. \r\n  Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â  â€œWhen the evidence \r\n  yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is \r\n  proper.â€Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. \r\n  469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  â€œIf more than one \r\n  reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted \r\n  to the jury.â€Â  Mullinax v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 333 S.C. 89, 92, \r\n  508 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1998) (citation omitted); Strange, 314 S.C. at 429-30, \r\n  445 S.E.2d at 440.Â  â€œIn deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict \r\n  motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or non-existence \r\n  of evidence.â€Â  Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).Â  This Court can only reverse the trial \r\n  court when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Swinton Creek \r\n  Nursery, 334 S.C. at 477, 514 S.E.2d at 130.Â  On appeal, we will uphold \r\n  a trial courtâ€™s denial of a directed verdict motion if supported by any evidence.Â  \r\n  Strange 314 S.C. at 430, 445 S.E.2d at 440.\r\nA partnership is an association of two or more \r\n  persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-210 \r\n  (Supp. 2003); see Wyman v. Davis, 223 S.C. 172, 174, 74 S.E.2d \r\n  694, 698 (1953); Halbersberg v. Berry, 302 S.C. 97, 101, 394 S.E.2d 7, \r\n  10 (Ct. App. 1990); Beck v. Clarkson, 300 S.C. 293, 301, 387 S.E.2d 681, \r\n  685 (Ct. App. 1989); Buffkin v. Strickland, 280 S.C. 343, 345, 312 S.E.2d \r\n  579, 580 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œ[W]here the parties to a contract, by their acts, \r\n  conduct, or agreement show that they intended to combine their property, labor, \r\n  skill and experience, or some of these elements on one side, and some on the \r\n  other, to carry on, as principals or co-owners, a common business, trade, or \r\n  venture as a commercial enterprise, and to share, either expressly or by implication, \r\n  the profits and losses or expenses that may be incurred, such parties are partners.â€Â  \r\n  Stephens v. Stephens, 213 S.C. 525, 532, 50 S.E.2d 577, 580 (1948).Â  \r\n  â€œA partnership agreement may rest in parol.Â  It may be implied and without express \r\n  intention.â€Â  Wyman, 223 S.C. at 174, 74 S.E.2d at 698; Halbersberg, \r\n  302 S.C. at 101, 394 S.E.2d at 10; accord Beck, 300 S.C. at 301, \r\n  387 S.E.2d at 685; Buffkin, 280 S.C. at 345, 312 S.E.2d at 580.Â  A partnership \r\n  may be found to exist by implication from the partiesâ€™ conduct.Â  Corley v. \r\n  Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1997); Stephens, 213 S.C. \r\n  at 532, 50 S.E.2d at 580.Â  â€œOne of the most important tests as to the existence \r\n  of a partnership is the intention of the parties.â€Â  Stephens, 213 S.C. \r\n  at 530-31, 50 S.E.2d at 579.Â  To determine whether a partnership exists, the \r\n  following tests are used:Â  (1) the sharing of profits and losses; (2) community \r\n  of interest in capital or property; and (3) community of interest in control \r\n  and management.Â  Wyman, 223 S.C. at 181, 74 S.E.2d 699; Stephens, \r\n  213 S.C. at 531, 50 S.E.2d at 579; Halbersberg, 302 S.C. at 101, 394 \r\n  S.E.2d at 10.Â  â€œ[W]hen all of the conditions exist which by law create a legal \r\n  relationship, the effects flowing legally from such relation follow whether \r\n  the parties foresaw and intended them or not.â€Â  Stephens, 213 S.C. at \r\n  531, 50 S.E.2d at 579.\r\nIn the case at bar, Respondent introduced evidence \r\n  showing the intention of the brothers was to conduct business as partners.Â  \r\n  On cross-examination, Appellant admitted he and Respondent agreed to enter into \r\n  a partnership:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Do you agree you all verbally agreed to a partnership?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Mr. Moore, looking at page 32 [of deposition], what \r\n  you read from before, the question on line 25 is, so prior to himâ€”thatâ€™s Craigâ€”returning \r\n  from Myrtle Beach, and prior to the time you signed this, you all were thinking \r\n  fifty-fifty, and the answer on page 33 is what?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.Â  I was thinking fifty-fifty.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the brothers also conducted themselves \r\n  as partners:Â  together they signed the original purchase agreement with Greene, \r\n  together they inquired with a bank about funding the enterprise, and together \r\n  they enlisted the services of an accountant to draw up financial documentation \r\n  for the partnership.Â  Thus, because there was not an absence of evidence demonstrating \r\n  the existence of a partnership, the trial court correctly denied Appellantâ€™s \r\n  motion for directed verdict and submitted the claim to the jury.\r\nVI.Â  Jury Charge\r\nAppellant next contends the trial court \r\n  erred in refusing to charge the jury that Respondent had the burden of showing \r\n  he had mitigated damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, \r\n  an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence \r\n  and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000); accord Burroughs v. Worsham, \r\n  352 S.C. 382, 392, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct.

Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 495-96, 514 S.E.2d 570-74 \r\n  (1999); Burroughs, 352 S.C. at 392, 574 S.E.2d at 220.Â  Appellant argues \r\n  Respondent should have shown how much money Respondent was making in his present \r\n  business to establish Respondentâ€™s loss.Â  His failure to do so, Appellant argues, \r\n  was fatal to his claim because he had not demonstrated he attempted to minimize \r\n  damages.Â  â€œAlthough the law requires an injured party to do those things a prudent \r\n  person would do to avoid damages that are reasonably avoidable, it does not \r\n  require him to exert himself unreasonably or to incur substantial expense to \r\n  avoid damages.â€Â  Chastain v.

App. 1985).Â  â€œMoreover, the party who claims damages should have \r\n  been minimized has the burden of proving they could reasonably have been avoided \r\n  or reduced.â€Â  Chastain, 310 S.C. at 420, 426 S.E.2d at 835; accord \r\n  Adam v. Orr, 260 S.C. 92, 98, 194 S.E.2d 232, 235 (1973);Â  Darby v. \r\n  Waterboggan of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 288 S.C. 579, 586, 344 S.E.2d 153, 156 \r\n  (1986); Hyde v. S.
