Bazen Company, Inc. and Legion\r\n  Insurance Company (Carrier) appeal the circuit court's decision affirming the decision\r\n  of the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate\r\n  Panel) to award Glenn Bazen (Claimant) certain workers' compensation benefits.Â \r\nWe affirm.Â Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBadger R. Bazen\r\n  (Father) owned and operated Badger R.\r\n  Bazen Company, Inc. (Employer) in 2002.[1] Â Claimant and Father testified they\r\n  entered into an oral employment contract.Â  Under the contract, Claimant, who\r\n  was living in Minnesota at the time, would return to South Carolina and work\r\n  for Employer in exchange for $30,000 per year, a tank of gas per week, and use\r\n  of a home owned by his parents as a free living arrangement.Â  After Claimant\r\n  began working for Employer, he sustained injuries while in the scope and course\r\n  of his employment on February 15, 2002.\r\nIn his order\r\n  addressing average weekly wages, the single commissioner found Father promised\r\n  to pay Claimant $30,000 per year, or $2,500 per month, a tank of gas per week,\r\n  and allow him to use a house and storage building free of charge. Â Relying on\r\n  testimony, the single commissioner found Claimant's use of the home and storage\r\n  facility to be an integral part of the parties' employment contract, not a mere\r\n  fringe benefit as discussed in Anderson v. Baptist Medical Center, 343\r\n  S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001).[2]Â \r\n  The single commissioner thereafter determined Claimant's average weekly wage was\r\n  $853.84 by concluding the fair rental value of the home was $1,200 per month\r\n  and his agreed upon wage was $30,000 per year.Â  Additionally, the single\r\n  commissioner awarded Claimant $549.42 per week in temporary total disability\r\n  benefits.Â  Finally, the single commissioner determined Claimant was underpaid\r\n  by $132.73 per week since February 15, 2005, the date of the accident, until\r\n  October 31, 2005.Â  Therefore, for a total of 193 weeks, the single commissioner\r\n  ordered Employer to pay Claimant $25,616.89 as a lump sum back-payment for\r\n  temporary total disability benefits.Â  \r\nThereafter, Employer\r\n  and Carrier applied for review of the single commissioner's findings to the Appellate\r\n  Panel.Â  Specifically, the parties argued the single commissioner erred in:Â  1) finding\r\n  the use of the house, storage building, and land provided by Employer should be\r\n  included in calculating Claimant's average weekly wage; 2) ruling it was\r\n  immaterial that the house and building were not owned by Employer; 3) determining\r\n  that Claimant was entitled to the maximum compensation rate of $549.42 for\r\n  2002; 4) finding Claimant was entitled to back-payments for temporary total\r\n  disability benefits; and 5) failing to grant Employer credit for overpayment of\r\n  temporary total disability payments.Â  The Appellate Panel unanimously affirmed all\r\n  of the single commissioner's findings of facts and conclusions of law.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel's order.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South\r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.&quot; Forrest v. A.S. Price Mech.,\r\n  373 S.C. 303, 306, 644 S.E.2d 784, 785 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)). Â &quot;In\r\n  workers' compensation cases, the [Appellate Panel] is the ultimate fact finder.&quot;\r\n  Â Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000)\r\n  (citation omitted). Â This court reviews facts based on the substantial evidence\r\n  standard. Â Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632\r\n  S.E.2d 874, 877 (Ct. App. 2006). Â &quot;Under the substantial evidence\r\n  standard, the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [Appellate\r\n  Panel] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.&quot; Â Forrest,\r\n  373 S.C. at 306, 644 S.E.2d at 785 (citing S.C. Code Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006)).\r\n  Â The appellate court may reverse or modify the Appellate Panel's decision only\r\n  if the claimant's substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision\r\n  is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence in the record. Â Id. at 306, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 785-86.Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole\r\n  record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion\r\n  the [Appellate Panel] reached.&quot; Â Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535\r\n  S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Value of House as Part of\r\n  Wage Contract\r\nEmployer and Carrier argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's decision to include\r\n  the value of the use of the house as part of Claimant's average weekly wage.Â \r\n  Specifically, Appellants argue use of the residence was a gratuitous gift from Claimant's\r\n  mother, and Claimant failed to present evidence in the record to substantiate\r\n  that the residence was a specified part of a wage contract.Â  In response, Claimant\r\n  argues the circuit court correctly included the home's value as part of his\r\n  weekly wage.Â  We agree with Claimant. \r\nSection 42-1-40 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) defines &quot;average weekly wage&quot; as &quot;the\r\n  earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at\r\n  the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately\r\n  preceding the date of the injury. . . .&quot;Â  The average weekly wage can\r\n  include allowances of any character when they are a specified part of his\r\n  employment contract.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (&quot;Whenever\r\n  allowances of any character made to an employee in lieu of wages are a\r\n  specified part of a wage contract they are deemed a part of his earnings.&quot;).Â  Anderson directs:Â  &quot;[B]efore an allowance will be included in the\r\n  average weekly wage calculation, it must (1) be made in lieu of wages, and (2)\r\n  be a specified part of a wage contract.&quot;Â  343 S.C. 487, 495, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  526, 530 (2001).Â  Here, we find there is substantial evidence of both.Â  \r\nIn this case, Father's and\r\n  Claimant's statements regarding an oral agreement are the sole evidence upon\r\n  which we can rely to determine the components of their contract.Â  Though there\r\n  is no written contract, no conflicting testimony exists regarding the contract\r\n  terms.Â  We believe Father and Claimant presented ample and consistent testimony\r\n  through depositions and hearings for us to affirm the finding that Claimant's\r\n  oral wage contract was $30,000 per year, a tank of gas per week, and his rent-free\r\n  living arrangement. \r\nSpecifically, Claimant\r\n  testified in his deposition that his employment agreement consisted of\r\n  &quot;[t]hree things:Â  free house; one tank of gas a week; $30,000[] a\r\n  year.&quot;Â  Additionally, Claimant testified, &quot;[t]he house was part of my\r\n  agreement with [Father] when I came back to work with him, and I still live\r\n  there.&quot;Â  Father corroborated Claimant's testimony through deposition\r\n  testimony and testimony before the single commissioner.Â  \r\nIn his deposition, Father\r\n  testified that he told Claimant he &quot;would give him [30,000] a year, a\r\n  house to live in[,] and a tank of gas a week.&quot;Â  Father responded\r\n  affirmatively when asked if Claimant had a guarantee of $2,500 per month in\r\n  income &quot;on top of the house and the taxes and the insurance and the gasoline\r\n  . . . .&quot;Â  Father's testimony remained consistent from his deposition to\r\n  his hearing before the single commissioner.Â  There, Father testified &quot;I\r\n  told him I would give him $2,500 a month, a tank of gas a week, and the house\r\n  and little shop there.&quot;Â  Father answered affirmatively when asked whether\r\n  Claimant's compensation was $30,000 per year or $2,500 per month.Â  Further, he\r\n  testified:Â  &quot;[Claimant] would not have come home for just 2,500 a month\r\n  without the house.&quot;Â  When asked whether he ever charged Claimant rent for\r\n  use of the house, Father responded &quot;No.Â  That was part of the deal for him\r\n  to come home.&quot; Â Further, Father testified that Claimant had to sell his\r\n  home in Minnesota in order to return to South Carolina, so Father felt he\r\n  should &quot;give him somewhere to stay as far as it was a package deal.&quot;Â  \r\nBecause ample evidence in the\r\n  record indicates Claimant's living arrangement was not merely a gift but part\r\n  of his wage contract, we do not believe Appellant's gratuitous benefit argument\r\n  has any merit.Â  Therefore, we believe the circuit court did not err in\r\n  affirming the Appellate Panel's decision to award Claimant the fair market\r\n  value of the use of the house as part of Claimant's average weekly wage.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's decision.Â  \r\nII. Rent Free Living\r\nEmployer and Carrier argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's decision to include\r\n  the rental value of Claimant's residence when he continued to live rent free in\r\n  the residence after his employment ended, and he never ceased receiving this\r\n  benefit.Â  Appellants maintain that to include the rental value unquestionably\r\n  confers a double benefit upon Claimant.[3]Â \r\n  In response, Claimant argues the contractual terms between the parties are\r\n  factual determinations that are left exclusively to the Appellate Panel.Â \r\n  Additionally, Claimant maintains his mother's conveyance of her property to Claimant\r\n  was not compensation by Employer; therefore, Employer should not be entitled to\r\n  a credit for the conveyance.Â  \r\nThe issue of Claimant's\r\n  living situation after the single commissioner's ruling and any double recovery\r\n  he may or may not have received is not preserved for our review.Â  Appellants\r\n  did not raise this issue to the Appellate Panel after the single commissioner's\r\n  ruling.Â  In fact, Appellants first raised the double recovery argument to the\r\n  circuit court on appeal.Â  Therefore this issue is not properly before this\r\n  court for review.Â  Smith v. NCCI, Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 256, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  268, 279 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;Only issues raised and ruled upon by the [Appellate\r\n  Panel] are cognizable on appeal.&quot;); see also Creech v. Ducane\r\n    Co., 320 S.C. 559, 467 S.E.2d 114 (Ct. App. 1995) (&quot;[O]nly issues\r\n  within the application for review are preserved for the full commission.&quot;).\r\n  Â Additionally, Appellants do not present any supporting case law for their\r\n  theory.Â  Therefore, we decline to address this issue on the merits.\r\nIII. Error in Calculating Claimant's\r\n  Average Weekly Wage\r\nEmployer and Carrier argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's determination that Claimant\r\n  was entitled to the maximum compensation rate for 2002.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Appellants maintain the Appellate Panel failed to consider Claimant's actual\r\n  earnings as reported for tax purposes and failed to calculate his average\r\n  weekly wage according to the method required by section 42-1-40 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.[4]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  42-1-40 provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  &quot;Average\r\n    weekly wage&quot; must be calculated by taking the total wages paid for the\r\n    last four quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the injury\r\n    occurred as reported on the Employment Security Commission's Employer\r\n    Contribution Reports divided by fifty-two or by the actual number of weeks\r\n      for which wages were paid, whichever is less. Â \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Here, the\r\n  single commissioner determined Claimant earned $27,500 in 2001, and then\r\n  divided $27,500 by forty-eight, the actual number of weeks Bazen paid Claimant\r\n  wages, rather than fifty-two.Â  In 2001, Claimant took a one-month vacation to\r\n  Israel during which time he did not receive compensation.Â  Therefore, Claimant\r\n  essentially received $27,500 in actual earnings for 2001 rather than $30,000.Â \r\n  Thus, Appellants argue the single commissioner should have divided $27,500, by\r\n  fifty-two in calculating Claimant's average weekly wage to reflect the vacation\r\n  time.Â  However, because the above mentioned statute requires the average weekly\r\n  wage be based on the &quot;actual number of weeks for which wages were paid,&quot;\r\n  we find there was no error in the calculation of Claimant's average weekly\r\n  wage.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's decision to affirm the Appellate Panel's calculation of Claimant's\r\n  average weekly wage pursuant to section 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  believe the record contains substantial evidence that Claimant's rent-free\r\n  living situation was part of his oral employment contract.Â  Further, we do not\r\n  believe Claimant's double recovery issue is preserved for our review.Â  Finally,\r\n  we do not believe there was any error in the calculation of Claimant's average\r\n  weekly wage pursuant to section 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of the workers' compensation hearings,\r\n  Father was retired.\r\n[2] Anderson cites case law that finds mileage\r\n  deductions and employer contributions to union trust funds for health and\r\n  welfare, pensions, and training are fringe benefits rather than &quot;the\r\n  actual sum paid to the employee as his wages . . . .&quot; 343 S.C. at 496, 541 S.E.2d at 530 (citing Stephen v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C.\r\n  334, 347, 478 S.E.2d 74, 81 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\n[3] Specifically, Appellants contend Claimant should have\r\n  been awarded only $576.92 per week, which would have properly compensated him\r\n  for the exact loss due to his incapacity to work.Â  Assuming they are correct in\r\n  their assertion, Appellants argue they should be entitled to a credit of the\r\n  difference between what was actually awarded and $576.92.Â  \r\n[4] Employer and Carrier also mention the living\r\n  arrangement issue in this section.Â  We\r\n  have already affirmed the portions of the order that concern Claimant's rental\r\n  income as part of his average weekly wage.Â  Therefore, we do not need to\r\n  revisit this issue here.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4682","title":"Farmer v.

Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Jonathan Kirk Fisher, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.:Â  Thomas\r\n  Michael Farmer (Husband) appeals from an order of the family court granting him\r\n  and Donna Yeargin Farmer (Wife) a divorce on grounds of one year's continuous\r\n  separation.Â  On appeal, Husband argues the family court erred in finding\r\n  certain payments he received from his employer to be marital property and subject\r\n  to equitable division.Â  Additionally, Husband maintains the family court erred\r\n  in ordering he pay Wife attorney's fees and costs.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  in 1984, and had one child as a result of the marriage who was emancipated at\r\n  the time of the divorce.Â  The parties originally brought the divorce action in\r\n  2004, but it was dismissed.Â  Subsequently, the parties reinitiated the divorce\r\n  action in 2007.Â  Because the parties had reached a settlement regarding the\r\n  division of marital assets and debt in a stipulation of mediation, the only\r\n  issues before the family court were a single asset, which the family court\r\n  refers to as the &quot;fruits of the Management Agreement between [Husband] and\r\n  CHM Homes, Inc. dated July 27, 1992&quot; and attorney's fees and costs.Â  \r\nThe family court granted\r\n  both parties a divorce on grounds of one year's continuous separation.Â  The\r\n  family court also approved the stipulation of mediation agreement, finding the\r\n  parties entered into it freely and voluntarily.Â  In regards to the Management Agreement\r\n  between Husband and CHM Homes, the family court found he entered into the\r\n  Management Agreement in 1992â€”eight years into the parties' marriage.Â \r\n  Additionally, the family court found Husband and CHM Homes terminated their\r\n  employment arrangement on December 3, 2004.[1]Â \r\n  Ultimately, the family court found Husband was the primary source of income for\r\n  the marriage.Â  Accordingly, the family court found the assets Husband received\r\n  from the Management Agreement were marital property and equally divided them\r\n  between the parties.Â  After equally dividing the assets and subtracting money\r\n  Husband already paid Wife from the total, the family court determined Husband\r\n  owed Wife $361,060.Â  Further, the family court awarded Wife $9,416.25 in\r\n  attorney's fees and $8,000 in costs.Â  Thereafter, Husband filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration which the family court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err by including\r\n  the proceeds Husband received in a severance package as part of the marital\r\n  estate and subject to equitable division?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n  awarding Wife attorney's fees and costs?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;On appeal from the\r\n  family court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors of law and find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 601-02, 510\r\n  S.E.2d 722, 724 (Ct. App. 1998). Â Although this court may find facts in\r\n  accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not\r\n  required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign\r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C.\r\n  229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2008).Â  &quot;The division of marital property\r\n  is within the sound discretion of the family court, and on appeal, it will not\r\n  be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  See Simpson v.\r\n    Simpson, 377 S.C. 527, 533, 660 S.E.2d 278, 282 (2008).Â  The decision to\r\n  award attorney's fees is also within the family court's discretion and will not\r\n  be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 538, 660 S.E.2d at\r\n  284.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Non-Compete Clause and\r\n  Termination Agreement Payments\r\nHusband argues the family court\r\n  erred by including the money he received from the Termination Agreement as part\r\n  of the marital estate, thereby making it subject to equitable division.Â  Husband\r\n  maintains he received funds pursuant to the Management Agreement he entered\r\n  into with CHM Homes which were intended to provide him future income he would\r\n  have otherwise obtained through competing employment.Â  To support his argument,\r\n  Husband cites to Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283, 292-93, 473 S.E.2d\r\n  881, 886-87 (Ct. App. 1996), where this court classified a non-compete\r\n  agreement as non-marital property.Â  Additionally, Husband cites McElveen v.\r\n    McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 506 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1998), modified on other\r\n      grounds by, Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 615 S.E.2d 98 (2005),\r\n  for the proposition.Â  As such, Husband argues the money he received from the Management\r\n  Agreementâ€” where value is attributable to a non-compete agreement or intended\r\n  to be a substitute for future incomeâ€”should not be characterized as marital\r\n  property either.Â  \r\nIn response, Wife argues the money\r\n  Husband received from the Termination Agreement was not for an agreement not to\r\n  compete but rather was for the &quot;princip[al] payments and property\r\n  appreciation on the venture.&quot;Â  Further, Wife maintains Husband's\r\n  contention that the non-compete clause allowed Husband to continue to receive\r\n  money past the termination of his employment and that the payments were to\r\n  replace the loss of future earnings is simply unsupported by the plain language\r\n  in the contract.Â  After examining the 1992 Management Agreement and the 2004 Termination\r\n  Agreement, we agree with Wife.Â  \r\nIn 1992, Husband and CHM\r\n  Homes entered into a Management Agreement.Â  Pursuant to the Management Agreement,\r\n  Husband agreed to &quot;refrain from any business activities which would\r\n  compete with&quot; CHM Homes.Â  No time frame was included in the non-compete\r\n  clause.Â  A detailed description of what would happen in the event of dissolution\r\n  was included in the Management Agreement.Â  Upon dissolution, the manager would\r\n  receive the fair market value of his interest, to be evaluated by the advisory\r\n  board.Â  Husband worked for CHM Homes for twenty-three years pursuant to this Management\r\n  Agreement.Â  \r\nThereafter, Husband and CHM\r\n  Homes entered into an &quot;Agreement for Termination of Quasi-Partnership&quot;\r\n  (Termination Agreement) because the parties desired &quot;to effect a\r\n  termination of the Management Agreement and any and all obligations and\r\n  relationships created thereby.&quot;Â  Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, CHM\r\n  Homes agreed to pay Husband $771,992.87 &quot;(comprised of $21,992.87\r\n  previously given by [Husband] to the Venture in the form of 'Loan Back' as\r\n  defined in the Management Agreement plus $750,000 owed to [Husband] for\r\n    principal payments and property appreciation on Venture).&quot;Â  (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The Termination Agreement reiterated the purpose of the payments &quot;as\r\n    consideration for principal payments on note for Venture property and property\r\n    appreciation.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  Both parties agreed to:\r\n\r\n  Release,\r\n    discharge, and hold harmless all other parties to this Termination Agreement\r\n    from any and all claims, damages, and expenses whatsoever, whether now existing\r\n    or hereafter arising, relating to the Management Agreement, the Venture or any\r\n    Loan Backs, employment, compensation, bonuses, assets, or other benefits which\r\n    may be associated therewith.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Husband waived\r\n  all rights to any future income from the Venture's finance income for which CHM\r\n  Homes assumed responsibility for any losses on the loan portfolio.Â  \r\nBased on the language in the Termination\r\n  Agreement, we agree with Wife and believe the money Husband received from the Termination\r\n  Agreement was part of the marital estate and subject to equitable division by\r\n  the family court.Â  As Wife points out, the purpose of the Termination Agreement,\r\n  as is expressly stated twice, was to compensate Husband for his contributions\r\n  to the business venture and appreciation of business assets.Â  Nowhere in the Termination\r\n  Agreement does it state its purpose is to compensate Husband for future income or\r\n  pay him for his promise to not compete with CHM Housing.Â  Furthermore, we\r\n  believe there was only one covenant not to compete which was part of the\r\n  original Management Agreement and is no longer in effect.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  agree with the family court's characterization of the &quot;fruits of the [T]ermination\r\n  [A]greement&quot; as being marital property because Husband's contributions to\r\n  the Venture, and the Venture's appreciation occurred while the parties were\r\n  still lawfully married.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630 (Supp. 2009)\r\n  (defining &quot;marital property&quot; as real or personal property acquired by\r\n  the parties during the marriage).Â  Additionally, we see no reason to disturb\r\n  the family court's equitable division of the money because of the wide\r\n  discretion given to the family court on these matters.Â  See Greene v.\r\n    GreeneÂ­Â­Â­, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002) (&quot;The\r\n  statute grants the family court discretion to decide what weight to assign\r\n  various factors.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's decision.Â  \r\nII. Attorney's Fees and Costs\r\nHusband maintains the family\r\n  court erred in ordering Husband to pay Wife $9,416.25 in attorney's fees and $8,000.00 in costs.Â  Specifically, Husband argues the family court failed to\r\n  set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to satisfy Rule\r\n  26(a) of the Family Court Rules.Â  Further, Husband maintains the record does\r\n  not contain sufficient facts to support such an award.Â  Wife maintains the\r\n  family court did not err in its award of attorney's fees.Â  Further, Wife argues\r\n  the family court exercised proper discretion in awarding both attorney's fees\r\n  and the fee for her expert.Â  We agree with Wife.Â  \r\nSection 20-3-130 (H) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) authorizes the family court to order payment of litigation\r\n  expenses to either party in a divorce action.Â  An award of attorney's fees\r\n  rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and should not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C.\r\n  151, 157, 459 S.E.2d 892, 896 (Ct. App. 1995). Â The family court is given broad\r\n  discretion in this area. Â See id.Â  The same considerations\r\n  that apply to awarding attorney's fees also apply to awarding litigation\r\n  expenses. Â See Nienow v. Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 173, 232 S.E.2d\r\n  504, 510 (1977).Â  \r\nA family court should first consider the following factors as set forth in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., in\r\n  deciding whether to award attorney's fees and costs:Â  (1) each party's\r\n  ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the\r\n  attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect\r\n  of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992); see also Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C.\r\n  158, 161 n.1, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 n.1 (1991).Â  After deciding to award attorney's\r\n  fees, a family court should then consider the following factors as set forth in Glasscock in deciding how much to award in attorney's fees and\r\n  costs:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time\r\n  necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary\r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  304 S.C. at 161, 403 S.E.2d at 315; see\r\n    also Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 546-47, 670 S.E.2d 669, 673 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  \r\nAlthough the family court did\r\n  not delineate its consideration of the E.D.M. factors, by our own preponderance\r\n  of the evidence, we find awarding attorney's fees was proper.Â  See Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 601-02, 510 S.E.2d\r\n  722, 724 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;On appeal from the family court, this\r\n  court has jurisdiction to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;).Â  We affirm the\r\n  decision, especially in light of Wife's beneficial results and the likelihood\r\n  that she initiated litigation in the first place in order to receive her\r\n  portion of Husband's business venture.Â  Â The family court noted the Glasscock factors in its order and thoroughly detailed its calculation of attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  Therefore, considering the E.D.M. factors under our view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence and the family court's consideration of the Glasscock factors, we do not believe the family court abused its discretion in awarding\r\n  Wife attorney's fees.Â  Furthermore, we find Wife's expert assisted her in\r\n  obtaining beneficial results and do not believe the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in awarding costs for the expert.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family\r\n  court's decision to award attorney's fees and costs as well as the amount\r\n  awarded.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family court's decision\r\n  to classify the money Husband received as a result of his Termination Agreement\r\n  as marital property and find the family court exercised proper discretion in equitably\r\n  dividing said property.Â  Additionally, we find the family court exercised\r\n  proper discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  decision of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Specifically, Husband and CHM Homes entered into the Termination\r\n  Agreement on December 3, 2004.Â  However, the Termination Agreement states:Â  &quot;The\r\n  Management Agreement shall be terminated, and the Venture created thereby\r\n  dissolved, as of September 30, 2004.&quot;Â  Therefore, the family court found\r\n  September 30, 2004, to be the effective date of the Termination Agreement.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4683","title":"Hale v.

Parker, of Hampton, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Â These\r\n  cross-appeals arise from a dispute between attorneys over the division of fees\r\n  in a civil litigation matter.Â  In the primary appeal, Appellant/Respondent\r\n  Thomas Finn, d/b/a Finn Law Firm (Finn) alleges error in the special referee's\r\n  award of actual and punitive damages to Respondents/Appellants James O. Hale\r\n  and Hale and Hale, P.A. (Hale) on Hale's cause of action for tortious\r\n  interference with contract.Â  In his cross-appeal, Hale argues the special\r\n  referee should have based actual damages on partnership law rather than on\r\n  quantum meruit.Â  Both Finn and Hale appeal the special referee's decision.Â  We\r\n  affirm the actual damages award and reverse the punitive damages award.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  October 15, 1997, Finn and Hale commenced an action on behalf of the Village\r\n  West Horizontal Property Regime and the Village West Owners' Association\r\n  (collectively Village West) arising out of a construction dispute.Â  Hale, an\r\n  attorney practicing in Beaufort County, had begun representing Village West in\r\n  1991 in routine legal matters.Â  At Hale's recommendation, the Mullen Firm,\r\n  where Finn was employed at the time, was associated in the case.\r\nBecause\r\n  of concerns about the applicable statutes of limitations and repose, the complaint\r\n  in the Village West lawsuit was filed before Village West finalized a fee\r\n  agreement with its attorneys.Â  Eventually, an agreement was reached on December\r\n  8, 1997, when Village West signed a contingency fee contract hiring Hale to\r\n  represent it in the above-mentioned construction litigation.Â  Under the\r\n  agreement, counsel would receive a contingency fee of thirty-three and one\r\n  third percent of any amount recovered unless an evidentiary hearing,\r\n  arbitration, or mediation hearing was required.Â  If any of these were\r\n  necessary, the contingency fee would be forty percent of the recovery.Â  Shortly\r\n  after Village West signed the contract with Hale, Hale sent the Mullen Firm a\r\n  copy of the contract with a letter stating his understanding that the\r\n  contingency fee would be divided equally between the two law firms.Â  Hale never\r\n  received a reply to this communication.\r\nHale,\r\n  Finn, and various other attorneys from the Mullen Firm, actively worked on the Village\r\n  West lawsuit during the preliminary stages.Â  A mediation in the lawsuit was\r\n  scheduled for December 11, 2001.Â Â  Contrary to instructions from his superior,\r\n  Finn met with the Village West Board of Directors before the mediation instead\r\n  of arranging for one of the senior partners of the Mullen Firm to meet with the\r\n  Board.Â  The mediation was unsuccessful, and a status conference had to be set\r\n  in the matter.\r\nDuring\r\n  this time, the Mullen Firm had become dissatisfied with some of Finn's work on\r\n  other matters, prompting the senior partner to ask another lawyer in the firm\r\n  to become involved with the Village West lawsuit.Â  A meeting was scheduled for\r\n  February 8, 2002, for that lawyer and Finn to review ten files that had been\r\n  assigned to Finn.Â  On the appointed day, however, Finn advised the other attorney\r\n  before the meeting was to begin that he intended to leave the Mullen Firm.\r\nBy\r\n  letter dated February 11, 2002, the President of the Village West Board of Directors,\r\n  advised both the Mullen Firm and Hale of Village West's desire to &quot;move\r\n  with [Finn]&quot; on the pending construction litigation.Â  On February 22,\r\n  2002, attorney Gregory Alford, who had been retained to represent Village West\r\n  in regime matters, sent Hale a letter requesting that Hale direct all further\r\n  communications with either the Board or its individual members to Alford's\r\n  office. Â Near the end of February 2002, Hale retained counsel to represent his\r\n  interest in the matter.\r\nBy agreement dated March 11, 2002, the Association retained Finn\r\n  &quot;in association with [the Mullen Firm]&quot; in the Village West\r\n  construction litigation.[1]Â \r\n  In a fax to the Mullen Firm dated April 1, 2002, Alford advised as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe Board's directive is that this agreement is not effective or\r\n  to be delivered to either Mullen Law Firm or Finn Law Firm until an agreement\r\n  to indemnify against Hale is delivered.Â  Finn and Seekings have indicated\r\n  orally that this would be done and a writing would be forthcoming to that\r\n  effect.[2]\r\n\r\nDespite the\r\n  Board's directive, neither Finn nor anyone else at the Mullen Firm ever gave\r\n  written confirmation of an indemnification agreement.Â  Hale apparently\r\n  continued to believe he was still counsel of record in the Village West\r\n  lawsuit, as evidenced by his appearance at a status conference in the matter on\r\n  February 14, 2002, and possibly a summary judgment hearing in May 2002.Â  In\r\n  July 2002, Alford advised Hale that during its March 2002 meeting, the Village\r\n  West Board of Directors ratified the termination of Hale's services in the\r\n  construction litigation.Â  Thereafter, Hale moved to withdraw and assert a lien\r\n  in the matter.\r\nThe Village\r\n  West lawsuit was settled for $7,002,500 in October 2002, and a settlement\r\n  disbursement accounting was rendered on November 4, 2002.Â  An attorney's fee of\r\n  approximately $2,801,000 was disbursed to the Mullen Firm.Â  Finn received 25\r\n  percent of this amount.Â  Although Hale's motion to be relieved as counsel and\r\n  motion for a lien were still pending, a form order was issued dismissing the\r\n  case.\r\nOn\r\n  September 29, 2003, a hearing took place in the Village West lawsuit on Hale's\r\n  motion to establish a lien for his fees on the proceeds of the settlement.Â  On\r\n  November 3, 2003, the court issued an order in which it acknowledged Hale had\r\n  previously been granted leave to amend his motion to assert a retaining lien\r\n  and any other equitable liens to which he may have been entitled.Â  The court\r\n  also granted a motion by Hale to join Finn and the Mullen Firm as parties to\r\n  this action.\r\nOn\r\n  January 6, 2005, Hale filed a separate action against the Mullen Firm and Finn\r\n  for breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations,\r\n  and breach of fiduciary duties.Â  In his complaint, Hale sought actual and\r\n  punitive damages.\r\nHale was formally relieved as counsel in the Village West lawsuit\r\n  on August 25, 2005.Â  Later, after all parties remaining in the Village West\r\n  litigation and those in Hale's action waived their right to a jury trial, the two\r\n  lawsuits were consolidated and referred to the special referee.\r\nThe special referee took testimony in the matter on August 16 and\r\n  17, 2006.Â  On the second day of the hearing, Hale settled with the Mullen Firm\r\n  for $400,000 on the breach of fiduciary duty claim, leaving Finn as the only\r\n  defendantÂ  Just before the testimony was to resume, counsel stipulated the only\r\n  cause of action against Finn was the claim for tortious interference with the contractual\r\n  relations between Hale and Village West.\r\nHale\r\n  acknowledged on direct examination there was no written joint representation\r\n  agreement to which Finn himself was a party.Â  In support of his claim, Hale testified\r\n  about his correspondence to the Mullen Firm regarding the fee division between\r\n  the two law firms.Â  He also presented evidence that he had devoted between six\r\n  hundred and eight hundred hours to the lawsuit and the directive of the Village\r\n  West Board of Directors that Finn and the Mullen Firm were to &quot;indemnify\r\n  against Hale.&quot;Â  In addition, it appears undisputed that Finn was aware of\r\n  Hale's lien. \r\nSometime during October 2006, the special referee issued to counsel\r\n  an unsigned draft order.Â  In the draft order, the special referee noted Hale,\r\n  after settling with all defendants except for Finn, &quot;continued to pursue a\r\n  single cause of action against Mr. Finn for tortious interference with\r\n  contractual rights,&quot; those contractual rights originating from Hale's\r\n  representation contract with Village West. Â With regard to the allegation by\r\n  Hale that Finn had interfered with the representation agreement between Hale\r\n  and Village West, the referee's proposed findings were that Hale failed to\r\n  carry his burden of proof that Finn engaged in tortious interference with this\r\n  agreement and that the Village West Board &quot;was primarily prompted by the\r\n  fact that Mr. Finn had earned their respect through his efforts and\r\n  dedication.&quot;\r\nNevertheless, the special referee proposed to find that &quot;Mr.\r\n  Finn willfully and recklessly agreed to distribution of the entire fee in total\r\n  disregard of Mr. Hale's right, and furthermore violated the proper practice of\r\n  bringing the matter to the Court's attention.&quot;Â  Based on this finding, the\r\n  special referee proposed to order Finn to pay Hale $525,000 in actual damages\r\n  and $50,000 in punitive damages, with the proviso that the award would be\r\n  reduced by any amounts paid by those defendants with whom Hale had settled.Â  The\r\n  amount of actual damages was based on the special referee's determination that\r\n  Hale was entitled to between 15 and 20 percent of the entire fee based on a\r\n  quantum meruit theory of recovery.Â  The special referee also rejected Finn's\r\n  defense that the Mullen Firm was in charge of actual disbursements, noting that\r\n  Finn, though aware that Hale had never been removed as counsel of record in the\r\n  case, agreed to the distribution of the entire fee to the Mullen Firm and\r\n  himself.Â  Citing Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U.S. 117 (1914), and McNair\r\n    v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998), the special\r\n  referee further stated &quot;[t]he attorneys' fees should have been held as a\r\n  constructive trust, and Mr. Finn's complicity and acquiescence of 100% without\r\n  justification constituted an interference with [Hale's] right to a portion of\r\n  the funds.&quot;\r\nBecause of objections from Finn to the proposed order, the special\r\n  referee reopened the record and held another hearing on February 16, 2007.Â  Before\r\n  the testimony began, counsel for Hale moved to amend the pleadings to conform\r\n  to the proof offered on the issue of interference with contractual relations at\r\n  the time the attorney's fees were disbursed and also to include a constructive\r\n  trust.Â  It is clear from the record that the motion resulted from the special\r\n  referee's invitation, in which he indicated &quot;that if the original pleading\r\n  was not adequate to cover interference at the time of disbursement and if the\r\n  plaintiff wishes to amend to make that a specific allegation then I'll grant\r\n  that motion and proceed on that basis.&quot; Â Hale declined to submit\r\n  additional evidence, and the hearing proceeded with Finn as the only witness.\r\nÂ On February 21, 2007, the special referee issued a final order in\r\n  the matter.Â  As in the draft order previously sent to counsel, the special\r\n  referee in the final order found Hale failed to carry his burden of proof that\r\n  Finn tortiously interfered with the representation agreement between Hale and\r\n  Village West.Â  Nevertheless, although the special referee noted, as he did in the\r\n  draft order, that Hale's sole cause of action against Finn was for tortious\r\n  interference with contractual rights, he also retained the findings from his\r\n  draft order that the contingent fee obtained in the underlying litigation\r\n  should have been held in trust and that Finn acted improperly in agreeing to\r\n  the division of the attorney's fee between himself and the Mullen Law Firm\r\n  without alerting the court to Hale's claim. Â As he did in the draft order, the\r\n  special referee ordered Finn to pay actual damages of $525,000.00, less the\r\n  amount to be paid by the Mullen Firm pursuant to its settlement with Hale;\r\n  however, punitive damages in the final order were decreased to $15,000.Â  Both\r\n  Hale and Finn appealed the special referee's final order.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n&quot;Courts have wide latitude in amending pleadings and, while\r\n  this power should not be exercised indiscriminately or to surprise or prejudice\r\n  an opposing party, the matter of allowing amendments is left to the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial judge.&quot;Â  Mylin v. Allen-White Pontiac, 281\r\n  S.C. 174, 180, 314 S.E.2d 354, 357 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nA trial court's determination of the constitutionality of a\r\n  punitive damages award is subject to a de novo standard of review.Â  Mitchell\r\n    v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 583, 686 S.E.2d 176, 182 (2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Finn's appeal\r\nA.&nbsp; Actual damages award\r\nOn appeal, Finn advances several arguments supporting his position\r\n  that the special referee's award of actual damages was improper.Â  First, relying\r\n  on the premise that the only issue before the special referee was Finn's\r\n  alleged interference with the contractual relations between Hale and Village\r\n  West, Finn argues an award for a claim for intentional interference with\r\n  contractual relations cannot be fashioned on quantum meruit entitlement. Â In\r\n  conjunction with this argument, he contends that the award was inconsistent\r\n  with the special referee's findings that he did not interfere with the\r\n  representation contract between Hale and Village West and that he believed the\r\n  Mullen Firm would assume responsibility for Hale's fees.Â  Second, he alleges\r\n  the special referee erred in &quot;bootstrapping&quot; to the claim for\r\n  intentional interference with contractual relations the elements of several unpled\r\n  causes of action, namely conversion and constructive trust, to support his\r\n  decision.Â  \r\nWe agree with Finn that because the special referee determined he\r\n  did not interfere with the representation contract between Hale and Village\r\n  West, damages for that cause of action were unwarranted. Â We disagree, however,\r\n  with his argument that the special referee lacked authority to base the award\r\n  of actual damages on quantum meruit.Â  Such an award was proper to enforce a\r\n  constructive trust.\r\nAs we have noted in our narrative of the facts, after the\r\n  settlement agreement between Hale and the Mullen Firm was read into the record,\r\n  counsel stipulated the only cause of action against Finn was interference with\r\n  contractual relations. Â Nevertheless, at the commencement of the second hearing\r\n  in the matter, Hale moved to amend his pleadings to &quot;include a\r\n  constructive trust,&quot; a basis for relief that was cited by the special\r\n  referee in his proposed order and not objected to by Finn when that order was\r\n  received by counsel. Â Furthermore, contrary to the contention in Finn's reply\r\n  brief that the special referee &quot;certainly did not state in the record any\r\n  reasons for allowing an amendment of the pleadings to conform to the\r\n  evidence,&quot; the special referee indicated he was willing to grant a motion\r\n  by Hale to amend his complaint to include &quot;a specific allegation&quot;\r\n  &quot;to cover interference at the time of disbursement.&quot;Â  It is apparent\r\n  from the other statements the special referee made during the colloquy that he\r\n  believed such an amendment would conform to the evidence of Finn's\r\n  &quot;interference at the time of disbursement.&quot;[3] Â Such interference can, as the\r\n  special referee indicated in both his proposed and final orders, give rise to the\r\n  imposition of a constructive trust.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  constructive trust arises entirely by operation of law without reference to any\r\n  actual or supposed intentions of creating a trust.&quot;Â  SSI Med. Servs. v.\r\n    Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793 (1990).Â  It &quot;arises\r\n  whenever a party has obtained money which does not equitably belong to him and\r\n  which he cannot in good conscience retain or withhold from another who is\r\n  beneficially entitled to it.&quot; Â Id. at 500, 392 S.E.2d at 793-94.Â  Authority\r\n  exists to support the proposition that &quot;a claim for imposition of a\r\n  constructive trust is not an independent cause of action.&quot;Â  Morrison v.\r\n    Morrison, 663 S.E.2d 714, 717 (Ga. 2008); see also Faulkner v.\r\n      Faulkner, 257 S.C. 172, 175-76, 184 S.E.2d 718, 720 (1971) (referring to\r\n  the doctrine of constructive trust as &quot;a creature of equity jurisprudence,\r\n  raised without regard to intention to prevent unjust enrichment&quot;).Â \r\n  &quot;A constructive trust does not . . . arise because of a manifestation of\r\n  an intention to create it, but it is imposed as a remedy to prevent\r\n  unjust enrichment.&quot;Â  Restatement (First) of Restitution Â§ 160 cmt.\r\n  a (1937) (emphasis added).Â  &quot;A constructive trust is a flexible equitable\r\n  remedy whose enforcement is subject to the equitable discretion of the trial\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Wendell Corp. Trustee v. Thurston, 680 A.2d 1314, 1320\r\n  (Conn. 1996).\r\nWe hold\r\n  the issue of Hale's right to a constructive trust in his favor was tried with\r\n  the implied consent of the parties.Â  During the hearing, Hale testified without\r\n  objection that after he realized he was no longer counsel of record for Village\r\n  West, he filed a lien to protect his interest in his fee agreement.Â  Moreover, Finn\r\n  never contended that Hale was not entitled to be paid; rather, his position was\r\n  that the Mullen Firm was responsible for fulfilling this obligation.Â  Finally,\r\n  we cannot ignore the duty that Finn, as an officer of the court, must discharge\r\n  upon receiving funds in which a third person has an interest.Â  See Rule\r\n  1.15(d), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR (requiring a lawyer to promptly notify any third\r\n  persons who have an interest in funds that the lawyer receives, to promptly\r\n  deliver such funds accordingly, and to render a full accounting upon request).\r\nIn challenging\r\n  the special referee's reliance on a constructive trust remedy, Finn has not asserted\r\n  any substantive reasons as to why Hale would not be entitled to this relief based\r\n  on this doctrine. Â In any event, we believe the special referee correctly\r\n  determined the attorney's fees from the Village West lawsuit should have been\r\n  held in trust pending satisfaction of Hale's claim on them and therefore acted\r\n  properly in imposing a constructive trust on the portion of the funds that, in\r\n  his determination, would satisfy Hale's right to quantum meruit recovery.Â  \r\nFinn\r\n  has also taken issue with the special referee's award decision to order a\r\n  quantum meruit award for a legal cause of action. Â There is no incongruity,\r\n  however, in using an equitable measure to determine Hale's recovery on a\r\n  constructive trust theory. Â See Verenes v. Alvanos, Op. No. 26780\r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 1, 2010) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. at 38, 43 n.7 (noting\r\n  &quot;a constructive trustÂ  . . . can arise from a breach of a fiduciary duty\r\n  giving rise to the obligation in equity to make restitution&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added); id. at 41, 44 (determining the respondent sought\r\n  restitution and disgorgement on as remedies for breach of fiduciary duties and\r\n  therefore rejecting the appellant's argument that he was entitled to a jury\r\n  trial because the cause of action he was defending was &quot;primarily a legal\r\n  action for money damages&quot;).Â  Regardless of whether the award can stand as\r\n  damages for interference with contractual relations, the discretion that must\r\n  be accorded to the special referee compels us to affirm the award as appropriate\r\n  recompense for misconduct necessitating the imposition of a constructive trust.\r\nB.&nbsp; Punitive damages award\r\nFinn also challenges the punitive damages award, arguing (1) he\r\n  did not engage in the sort of reprehensible conduct that would justify the\r\n  imposition of punitive damages; and (2) the award was based on his alleged\r\n  failure to see that a debt was paid to Hale.Â  In response, Hale contends (1)\r\n  Finn failed to preserve his arguments on this issue for appeal, alleging they\r\n  were raised neither in the trial court nor in any post-trial motion; (2) Finn's\r\n  conduct warranted the imposition of punitive damages; and (3) Finn and Hale\r\n  were fiduciaries, not debtor and creditor.\r\nWe agree with Finn that his arguments concerning punitive damages\r\n  were preserved for appeal.Â  After the special referee sent a draft order to\r\n  counsel for the parties for review and comment, Finn's attorney specifically\r\n  objected to the punitive damages, and the reduction of the punitive damages in\r\n  the final order was tantamount to a ruling on this objection.\r\n&quot;Punitive damages are . . . by definition 'punishing damages'\r\n  or 'private fines' levied to punish a wrongdoer for reprehensible conduct and\r\n  to deter its repetition in the future.&quot;Â  Patterson v. I.H. Servs.,\r\n  295 S.C. 300, 310, 368 S.E.2d 215, 221 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations omitted).Â \r\n  &quot;The state's interests in awarding punitive damages must remain consistent\r\n  with the principle of penal theory that 'the punishment should fit the crime.'\r\n  &quot;Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 584, 686 S.E.2d at 183 (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;In any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the\r\n  plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (2005).\r\nPreviously, appellate courts in South Carolina have applied an\r\n  abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court's post-judgment review\r\n  of a punitive damages award; however, because of changes in federal case law,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court has recently adopted a de novo standard for\r\n  the review of trial court determinations of the constitutionality of punitive\r\n  damages awards.Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 583, 686 S.E.2d at 182.Â  Adoption\r\n  of this heightened standard of review is consistent with our decision in Longshore\r\n    v. Saber Security Services, 365 S.C. 554, 619 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App. 2005),\r\n  wherein this Court reversed a punitive damages award based on our determination\r\n  that there was no clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's conduct\r\n  was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the rights of others.Â  Id. at 564-65, 619 S.E.2d at 11\r\nAlthough we have upheld the award of actual damages, this\r\n  affirmance is based solely on our determination that the award constituted the\r\n  enforcement of a constructive trust, an equitable remedy that in this State\r\n  does not include the imposition of punitive damages.Â  See Welborn v.\r\n    Dixon, 70 S.C. 108, 118, 49 S.E. 232, 235 (1904) (stating &quot;punitive damages cannot be awarded on the equity side of the court&quot;); Harper v.\r\n      Ethridge, 290 S.C. 112, 123, 348 S.E.2d 374, 380 (Ct. App. 1986) (noting in\r\n  an action involving both legal and equitable causes of action that &quot;the\r\n  evidence on punitive damages would be irrelevant to the equitable\r\n  claims&quot;).Â  In any event, we also agree with Finn that his actions do not\r\n  call for the payment of exemplary damages.[4]\r\nThe special referee described Finn's apparent disregard of Hale's\r\n  right to share in the attorney's fees as &quot;willful and reckless&quot;;\r\n  however, our review of the record in this case indicates otherwise.Â  As the\r\n  special referee found, the Mullen Firm was in charge of the actual\r\n  disbursements, and Finn, at worst, &quot;unilaterally entrust[ed] that\r\n  responsibility to [the Mullen Firm].&quot; Â Such behavior, though falling short\r\n  of what is rightly expected of attorneys when they are handling fee\r\n  disbursements, does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of misconduct\r\n  that was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of another's rights.Â  \r\nWe acknowledge comments were made on Finn's behalf that what\r\n  happened to Hale was &quot;reprehensible&quot;; however, these unfortunate\r\n  remarks should not be taken as binding admissions that the alleged\r\n  reprehensibility of Finn's conduct was of such a degree so as to call for\r\n  punitive measures.Â  Following the criteria set forth by the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court in Mitchell to assess reprehensibility in a dispute\r\n  concerning punitive damages, we find as follows:Â  (1) the harm resulting from\r\n  Finn's failure to disclose Hale's interest was economic rather than physical;\r\n  (2) any breach of duty on Finn's part, therefore, cannot be found to evince an\r\n  indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; (3)\r\n  there was no evidence that Hale, aggrieved party in this case, had financial\r\n  vulnerability; (4) Finn's conduct involved only an isolated incident rather\r\n  than repeated actions; and (5) the harm to Hale was not the result of\r\n  intentional malice, trickery, or deceit on Finn's part.[5]Â  See Mitchell, 385 S.C.\r\n  at 585, 686 S.E.2d at 184-85.Â  Based on these circumstances, we reverse the\r\n  punitive damages award ordered by the special referee.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Hale's appeal\r\nHale cross-appeals, contending the calculation of his damages\r\n  should have been based on partnership law rather than on quantum meruit.Â  We\r\n  disagree.[6]\r\nIn support of his position, Hale cites the South Carolina Uniform\r\n  Partnership Act, which provides that &quot;the rights and duties of the\r\n  partners in relation to the partnership shall be determined, subject to any\r\n  agreement between them, by the following rules:Â  each partner shall . . . share\r\n  equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including\r\n  those to partners, are satisfied.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-510(1) (2006).\r\nWe have upheld the award of actual damages solely on the basis of\r\n  a constructive trust doctrine.Â  As we previously noted, the trial judge should\r\n  be given discretion as to how a constructive trust, as an equitable remedy,\r\n  should be enforced.Â  Considering that such a remedy is fashioned to restore the\r\n  aggrieved party to the status quo ante and that the only written agreement\r\n  regarding the division of attorney's fees was between Hale and the Mullen Firm,\r\n  we cannot say that an award based on quantum meruit was an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  See Lollis v. Lollis, 291 S.C. 525, 529, 354 S.E.2d 559,\r\n  561 (1987) (&quot;A constructive trust results from fraud, bad faith, abuse of\r\n  confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation\r\n  in equity to make restitution.&quot;) (emphasis added). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs to\r\n  Finn's appeal, we reverse the punitive damages award and affirm the award of\r\n  actual damages on the doctrine of constructive trust.Â  Regarding Hale's\r\n  cross-appeal, we hold the special referee acted within his discretion in basing\r\n  actual damages on quantum meruit.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because of personnel changes, the name of the Mullen\r\n  Firm changed; however, the change does not impact the merits of this appeal.\r\n[2]Â  Seekings was an attorney with the Mullen Firm.\r\n[3]Â  Moreover, although as Finn argues in his reply\r\n  brief, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure require the trial judge to\r\n  &quot;state in the record the reason or reasons for allowing the amendment or\r\n  evidence,&quot; the lack of a formal amendment &quot;does not affect the result\r\n  of the trial of these issues.&quot;Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP.\r\n[4]Â  None of the issues in Finn's appeal concern the\r\n  propriety of awarding punitive damages when the corresponding actual damages\r\n  award are equitable in nature; therefore, we base our reversal of the punitive\r\n  damages award on the Mitchell factors.\r\n[5]Â  As to the fifth factor, we note the special referee himself acknowledged in the appealed\r\n  order that he was &quot;very impressed with the candor of Mr. Finn's testimony\r\n  during the reconvened hearing, at which time he explained why he relied upon\r\n  Mr. Mullen to 'take care of the Hale problem.' &quot;Â  Moreover, apparently\r\n  based on this testimony, the special referee significantly reduced the amount\r\n  of punitive damages from what he had proposed in the draft order.Â  \r\n[6]Â  In his proposed draft\r\n  order, the special referee proposed to base his determination of actual damages\r\n  based on quantum meruit.Â  Hale did not object to this proposal, and the\r\n  provision in the final order regarding actual damages is identical to that in\r\n  the draft order.Â  It is therefore questionable that the issue of whether the\r\n  amount of damages should have been based on partnership law was even raised to\r\n  the special referee.Â  Furthermore, the final order never mentioned that Hale\r\n  requested damages based on partnership law, much less explicitly ruled on any\r\n  such request, and Hale did not move to alter or amend the order.Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  in view of the fact that Hale did not have the opportunity to respond to\r\n  concerns about error preservation, we address the issue he raised in his\r\n  cross-appeal on the merits.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4684","title":"State Accident Fund v.

Edwards, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The State Accident Fund (Carrier)\r\n  sought reimbursement from the South Carolina Second Injury Fund (the Fund) for\r\n  monies Carrier paid to Clinton Gaskins for a stroke he suffered during surgery\r\n  for a work-related back injury.Â  The Fund and the single commissioner denied\r\n  Carrier's claim as it related to monies paid for the stroke.Â  Both the\r\n  Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) and\r\n  the circuit court affirmed.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 30, 2002, while employed by Pee Dee Regional\r\n  Transportation Authority, Gaskins suffered a work-related back injury.Â  Gaskins\r\n  already suffered from degenerative disk disease and stenosis of the lumbar\r\n  spine.Â  On May 9, 2002, Gaskins underwent surgery to treat his back problems.Â \r\n  During this surgery, he suffered a stroke that resulted in permanent brain\r\n  injury.Â  Carrier initially denied coverage for the stroke as not causally\r\n  related to the back problems, and Gaskins, his employer, and Carrier presented\r\n  arguments to the single commissioner on the issue of causation.[1]Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn the meantime, Carrier presented the Fund with its claim for\r\n  reimbursement of monies paid for Gaskins's back surgery.Â  On November 29, 2004,\r\n  the Fund agreed to reimburse Carrier in an agreement that specified:\r\n\tNature of Injury: BACK\r\n\tNature of Prior Impairment:Â  DDD/LUMBAR\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPINAL STENOSIS/LUMBAR\r\n\tThe terms of this agreement are that the said STATE ACCIDENT FUND\r\n  shall receive reimbursement of:\r\n\tIN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 42-9-400.\r\n\tFOR THE LUMBAR SPINE ONLY\r\n\tThis agreement is in full and complete satisfaction of any and all\r\n  claims by STATE ACCIDENT FUND against Second Injury Fund for the above\r\n  referenced accident claim.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission (Commission) approved this agreement.Â  Neither party\r\n  challenged the Commission's approval.Â  \r\nOne\r\n  month after Carrier and the Fund signed the Agreement to Reimburse (Agreement),\r\n  the single commissioner issued an order finding the stroke was causally related\r\n  to the back injury in the action involving Gaskins, his employer, and Carrier.Â  On May 23, 2005, the single commissioner\r\n  entered a consent order reflecting the agreement among Gaskins, his employer,\r\n  and Carrier that Gaskins was entitled to $200,000 and all medical care causally\r\n  related to his injuries.Â  The Fund was not a party to this agreement. \r\nNearly\r\n  two years later, on September 25, 2006, Carrier requested reimbursement under\r\n  the Agreement for monies paid to Gaskins for the stroke he suffered during back\r\n  surgery, which Carrier asserted was causally connected to the back injury.Â  The\r\n  Fund denied this request.Â  At the hearing before the single commissioner,\r\n  Carrier presented evidence from the previous hearing regarding Gaskins's\r\n  treating physicians that supported its argument the stroke was causally related\r\n  to the back surgery.Â  In addition, Carrier argued it relied upon the Fund's\r\n  past practice of including causally related injuries in those covered by its\r\n  settlement agreements.Â  Finally, Carrier questioned the validity of the\r\n  Agreement based upon the Fund's change in practice and the fact only one\r\n  commissioner, rather than a majority, approved the Agreement.[2]Â  The\r\n  Fund argued the medical reports did not establish a sufficient causal\r\n  connection between the back injury and the stroke to justify amending the Agreement\r\n  to cover the stroke.Â  The single commissioner denied Carrier's claim on the\r\n  basis that the Agreement's language excluded injuries other than to the lumbar\r\n  spine and declined to reach the issue of causation.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the denial.Â  \r\nBefore the circuit court, Carrier argued the statute referenced in\r\n  the Agreement covered causally related conditions.Â  Because its refusal to\r\n  amend the agreement represented a departure from the Fund's usual practice,\r\n  Carrier argued, the Fund should be estopped from refusing to amend and the\r\n  issue of causal relation should be litigated before the Appellate Panel.Â \r\n  Furthermore, according to Carrier, the Appellate Panel committed reversible\r\n  error by basing its decision upon an unpublished opinion of this court.Â  The\r\n  Fund protested that Carrier actually sought to void the contract.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the denial of Carrier's claim and denied Carrier's motion to\r\n  reconsider this ruling.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the\r\n  standard for judicial review of decisions of the Commission.Â  Liberty Mut.\r\n    Ins.

Â§\r\n  1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2009) (establishing the standard for judicial review of\r\n  agency decisions).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence,\r\n  nor is it evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case; rather, it is &quot;evidence\r\n  which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach\r\n  the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Liberty Mut., 363 S.C. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at 300.Â \r\n  &quot;The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence\r\n  does not prevent an administrative agency's findings from being supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at 301.Â  Where\r\n  conflicts in the evidence exist over a factual issue, the findings of the\r\n  Appellate Panel are conclusive.Â  Id. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at 301.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Coverage\r\n  of Stroke under the Agreement\r\nCarrier asserts the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate\r\n  Panel's finding the Agreement did not cover Gaskins's stroke as a consequence\r\n  flowing from the back injury.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Fund was\r\n  established by statute and reimburses employers and insurance carriers after\r\n  they pay certain claims.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-7-310 (Supp. 2009).Â  To qualify\r\n  for reimbursement, an employer or carrier must timely provide the Fund with\r\n  certain information.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(a), (c), (f), &amp; (l) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  When a permanently disabled employee:\r\n\r\n\t[I]ncurs\r\n  a subsequent disability from injury by accident arising out of and in the\r\n  course of his employment, resulting in compensation and medical payments\r\n  liability or either, for disability that is substantially greater and is caused\r\n  by aggravation of the preexisting impairment than that which would have\r\n  resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance\r\n  carrier shall pay all awards of compensation and medical benefits provided by\r\n  this title; but such employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from\r\n  the Second Injury Fund&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 42-9-400(a).Â \r\n  &quot;Permanent physical impairment&quot; refers to &quot;any permanent\r\n  condition, whether congenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness\r\n  as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to\r\n  obtaining reemployment if the employee should become unemployed.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(d) (Supp. 2009).Â  If a claimant suffering from a permanent\r\n  physical impairment most probably would not have suffered the subsequent injury\r\n  &quot;'but for' the presence of the prior impairment,&quot; the Fund must\r\n  reimburse an employer or carrier for properly requested compensation and\r\n  medical benefits without regard to whether the liability is &quot;substantially\r\n  greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(g) (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Fund &quot;shall not be bound as to any question of law or fact&quot;\r\n  determined in an agreement, award, or adjudication to which it was not a party\r\n  or of which it had less than twenty days' notice.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(e)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  The Fund &quot;can enter into compromise settlements at the\r\n  discretion of the director with approval of a majority of the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission, provided a bona fide dispute exists.&quot;Â  S.C.

Â§ 42-9-400(j) (Supp. 2009).\r\nSection 42-9-400(a) mandates that Carrier &quot;shall&quot; pay\r\n  for Gaskins's subsequent injuries and that the Fund &quot;shall&quot; reimburse\r\n  Carrier for those payments.Â  However, subsection (j) of the same statute\r\n  enables the Fund to enter into compromise agreements with carriers limiting the\r\n  Fund's obligations.Â  Here, Carrier and the Fund entered into just such a\r\n  compromise agreement as to the payments Carrier made related to Gaskins's back\r\n  injury.Â  The terms of the Agreement clearly indicate the parties did not\r\n  contemplate extending its coverage to any causally connected injuries that\r\n  might have followed.Â  Moreover, the record indicates at the time the Agreement\r\n  was made, Carrier still disputed its liability for Gaskins's stroke.Â  Although\r\n  Carrier knew Gaskins was seeking coverage for the stroke, the single\r\n  commissioner did not find Carrier liable for medical benefits related to the\r\n  stroke until a month after the Agreement was made.Â  At the time of the\r\n  Agreement, Carrier knew the issue of its liability for the stroke remained\r\n  unresolved.Â  Had Carrier intended to seek reimbursement for stroke expenses\r\n  from the Fund under the subject Agreement, it had ample opportunity to\r\n  negotiate this issue with the Fund.Â  However, the record does not indicate\r\n  Carrier proposed adding to the Agreement any language addressing this issue or\r\n  otherwise sought reimbursement from the Fund until two years later.Â \r\n  Consequently, the circuit court did not err in affirming the Appellate Panel's\r\n  exclusion of stroke-related expenses from the Agreement.[3]\r\nII.&nbsp; Voidness\r\nNext, Carrier asserts the circuit court erred in failing to find the Agreement is void because no\r\n  meeting of the minds occurred at the Agreement's inception.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhether the language of a contract is ambiguous is a question of\r\n  law to be determined by the court from the terms of the contract as a whole.Â  Silver\r\n    v. Aabstract Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., 376 S.C. 585, 591, 658 S.E.2d 539, 542\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008).Â  In making this determination, the court must examine the\r\n  entire contract and not merely whether certain phrases taken in isolation could\r\n  be interpreted in more than one way.Â  Id.Â  &quot;'[O]ne may not, by\r\n  pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225\r\n  S.E.2d 344, 348 (1976)).Â  \r\n\r\n\t&quot;In construing and determining the effect of a written\r\n  contract, the intention of the parties and the meaning are gathered primarily\r\n  from the contents of the writing itself, or, as otherwise stated, from the four\r\n  corners of the instrument, and when such contract is clear and unequivocal, its\r\n  meaning must be determined by its contents alone; and a meaning cannot be given\r\n  it other than that expressed. Hence words cannot be read into a contract which\r\n  import an intent wholly unexpressed when the contract was executed.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. (quoting McPherson v. J.E. Sirrine\r\n  &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183, 204, 33 S.E.2d 501, 509 (1945)).\r\nCarrier's argument is essentially that the Agreement should be\r\n  void because the coverage language within it contains an ambiguity.Â  Carrier\r\n  avers it understood the coverage included both the lumbar spine and other\r\n  causally related injuries because it believed the Fund covered other claimants'\r\n  causally related injuries.Â  The Fund argues the coverage was limited to the\r\n  lumbar spine, only.Â  The alleged ambiguity springs not from the terms of the\r\n  Agreement itself, but from Carrier's observations of Fund behavior in matters\r\n  unrelated to Gaskins's claims.Â  According to Carrier, the Fund agreed to pay\r\n  causally related expenses of other claimants after executing agreements similar\r\n  to this one.[4]Â \r\n  However, no evidence indicates that Carrier was a party to any of these other\r\n  agreements or that the Fund represented to Carrier it would pay for Gaskins's\r\n  stroke.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not err in refusing to declare the\r\n  Agreement void.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Estoppel\r\nCarrier asserts the circuit court erred in failing to find the\r\n  Fund is estopped from denying reimbursement for Gaskins's stroke.Â  We disagree.\r\nCourts apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel when one party,\r\n  &quot;by his actions, conduct, words or silence which amounts to a\r\n  representation, or a concealment of material facts, causes another to alter his\r\n  position to his prejudice or injury.&quot;Â  Rushing v. McKinney, 370\r\n  S.C. 280, 293, 633 S.E.2d 917, 924 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Hubbard v.\r\n    Beverly, 197 S.C. 476, 480, 15 S.E.2d 740, 741 (1941)).Â  For equitable\r\n  estoppel to apply, each party must meet certain criteria:Â  \r\n\r\n\tWith regard to the party estopped, the elements of equitable\r\n  estoppel are: (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment of\r\n  material facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that\r\n  the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to\r\n  assert; (2) the intention or expectation that such conduct shall be acted upon\r\n  by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge of the real\r\n  facts.Â  As related to the party claiming the estoppel, the essential elements\r\n  are: Â (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to\r\n  the facts in question, (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped, and\r\n  (3) prejudicial change in position. \r\n\r\nId. at 293-94, 633 S.E.2d at 924 (internal\r\n  citations and quotations omitted).Â  However, a court will not rescind a\r\n  contract solely on the basis of unilateral mistake unless the party opposing\r\n  rescission induced the mistake &quot;by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation,\r\n  concealment, or imposition . . . , without negligence on the part of the party\r\n  claiming rescission, or where mistake is accompanied by very strong and\r\n  extraordinary circumstances which would make it a great wrong to enforce the\r\n  agreement.&quot;Â  Truck South, Inc. v. Patel, 339 S.C. 40, 49, 528\r\n  S.E.2d 424, 429 (2000).Â  \r\nEquitable estoppel applies when each party meets three conditions.Â  Rushing, 370 S.C. at 293-94, 633 S.E.2d at 924.Â  One of those conditions\r\n  requires that the party to be estopped must have exhibited misleading conduct\r\n  during formation of the agreement with the intent or expectation the\r\n  complaining party would rely on it.Â  Id.Â  Here, Carrier argues the Fund\r\n  should be estopped from limiting reimbursement to monies paid for Gaskins's\r\n  back injury because the Fund did not notify Carrier that it ceased its practice\r\n  of reimbursing for causally related injuries.Â  However, Carrier failed to\r\n  establish the Fund made any representations with regard to reimbursement for\r\n  Gaskins's injuries other than those reflected in the Agreement.Â  Carrier bases\r\n  its estoppel argument on the Fund's payment of other, unrelated claims.Â  The\r\n  details of these claims and of the Fund's reasoning in paying them are\r\n  unknown.Â  Furthermore, even if the Fund did suddenly change its policy, which\r\n  it denies,[5] no evidence indicates the Fund did so with the intention of inducing Carrier to\r\n  rely on its past behavior in making the subject Agreement.Â  Rather, in this\r\n  case, Carrier appears to have made a unilateral mistake in assuming the Fund\r\n  would agree to cover benefits paid for the stroke under the current Agreement.Â  See Truck South, 339 S.C. at 49, 528 S.E.2d at 429.Â  Despite\r\n  Carrier's argument to the contrary, strong and extraordinary circumstances\r\n  militating in favor of rescission do not exist here.Â  As a result, Carrier\r\n  failed to establish the Fund's actions merited equitable estoppel, and the\r\n  circuit court did not err.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Carrier and the Fund executed an Agreement that clearly\r\n  set forth the contours of their compromise agreement.Â  Furthermore, we find\r\n  that, despite having knowledge of the expenses and ample opportunity to request\r\n  their inclusion, Carrier failed to seek inclusion of the stroke expenses in the\r\n  terms of the Agreement.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's decision that\r\n  the Agreement did not cover Carrier's expenses flowing from Gaskins's stroke.Â  \r\nNext, we find the terms of the Agreement are clear and\r\n  unequivocal.Â  An ambiguity originating not in the terms of this Agreement but in\r\n  Carrier's observations of Fund behavior in other, unrelated matters is not a\r\n  legal basis for declaring the Agreement void. Â Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's determination that the Agreement is not void.Â  \r\nFinally, we find Carrier failed to prove all necessary elements of\r\n  its claim for estoppel.Â  Consequently, we affirm the circuit court's refusal to\r\n  apply equitable estoppel to this matter.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the order\r\n  of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Fund was not a party to this proceeding.Â  \r\n[2] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(j) (Supp. 2009)\r\n  (authorizing the Fund to enter into settlement agreements &quot;at the\r\n  discretion of the director with approval of a majority of the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission&quot;).Â  \r\n[3] We do not base this ruling upon the Fund's argument that this Agreement was\r\n  a &quot;clincher.&quot;Â  By definition, a clincher agreement is a final release\r\n  between the employer and employee.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-801(E) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  A court is without jurisdiction to review a clincher agreement that\r\n  includes language precluding judicial review and that has been duly approved by\r\n  the Commission.Â  Spivey ex rel. Spivey v. Carolina Crawler, 367 S.C.\r\n  154, 159, 624 S.E.2d 435, 437 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This Agreement, made between\r\n  Carrier and the Fund, neither fits the definition of a clincher nor includes\r\n  the necessary language depriving the court of jurisdiction.\r\n[4] This argument appears to be more in the nature of an\r\n  estoppel argument.Â  \r\n[5] On appeal, the Fund asserts it does not have a custom\r\n  or practice of reimbursing employers and carriers for expenses not indicated in\r\n  its settlement agreements.Â  However, the Fund admits that it agreed to amend\r\n  some settlement agreements under certain circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4685","title":"Wachovia Bank, N.A. v.

Coffey (Dr. Coffey), a Hilton Head obstetrician, was diagnosed with terminal\r\n  lung cancer and was told that he had six months to live.&nbsp; On July 23,\r\n  2001, Dr. Coffey took out a $125,000 home equity line of credit with\r\n  Wachovia.&nbsp; Mrs. Coffey was not aware of the transaction, and Wachovia's\r\n  employees failed to verify Dr. Coffey's authority to mortgage the couple's\r\n  home.&nbsp; Dr. Coffey signed a mortgage document purporting to secure the loan\r\n  with the couple's home, which was titled in Mrs. Coffey's name only.&nbsp; On\r\n  July 30, 2001, at Dr. Coffey's request, Wachovia wired the loan proceeds to the\r\n  Hilton Head branch of Carolina First Bank to be deposited in the account of\r\n  Hilton Head Yachts, Ltd., a business that had sold to Dr. Coffey a\r\n  thirty-six-foot Beneteau sailboat (the boat).&nbsp; The boat was then titled in\r\n  the name of A&amp;M Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation in which Dr. Coffey\r\n  and Mrs. Coffey were the only shareholders.&nbsp; Dr. Coffey told Mrs. Coffey\r\n  that the boat was &quot;paid for.&quot;&nbsp; Dr. Coffey, who handled virtually\r\n  all of the couple's financial transactions, used the couple's joint checking\r\n  account to make payments on the loan until his death in March 2005.&nbsp; \r\nSoon after Dr. Coffey's death,\r\n  Mrs. Coffey began a months-long effort to sell the boat.&nbsp; She continued\r\n  the payments on the loan from Wachovia, but for several months she was unaware\r\n  that the loan was for the boat purchase.&nbsp; She testified that by the fall\r\n  of 2005, she realized that these payments related to Dr. Coffey's boat purchase\r\n  but that she was under the impression that the loan was secured by a lien on\r\n  the boat, rather than a mortgage on their home, and that the amount of the loan\r\n  was much smaller than it actually was.&nbsp; \r\nIn September 2005, Mrs. Coffey\r\n  hired a broker to locate a buyer for the boat.&nbsp; By late November 2005, the\r\n  broker located a buyer, and on January 5, 2006, the broker prepared an initial\r\n  seller's disbursement summary showing the balance of Wachovia's boat loan to\r\n  Dr. Coffey. &nbsp;However, the final seller's disbursement summary did not\r\n  reflect the debt owed to Wachovia.&nbsp; According to Mrs. Coffey, she had\r\n  given the boat loan information to the broker, but the broker contacted\r\n  Wachovia and learned that there was &quot;no lien&quot; on the boat and that\r\n  the sale proceeds could be transferred to A&amp;M Partners, Inc., the\r\n  corporation in which she and Dr. Coffey held stock.&nbsp; Ultimately, Mrs.\r\n  Coffey received the net proceeds of the sale, and she deposited them into one\r\n  of her bank accounts.&nbsp; \r\nMrs. Coffey also stated that\r\n  shortly after the closing of the boat sale in January 2006, she realized that\r\n  Dr. Coffey had purchased the boat with loan proceeds from a home equity line of\r\n  credit and that he had signed a mortgage purportedly securing the debt with\r\n  their home.&nbsp; Mrs. Coffey indicated that she became angry at Wachovia's\r\n  employees about the transaction taking place without her knowledge and refused\r\n  to make any further payments on the loan. \r\nWachovia later filed this\r\n  mortgage foreclosure action against Mrs. Coffey.&nbsp; In its initial complaint\r\n  filed on June 30, 2006, Wachovia originally named as defendants Dr. Coffey's\r\n  estate, Mrs. Coffey, both individually and as personal representative of Dr.\r\n  Coffey's estate, and three of the couple's five children.&nbsp; Wachovia filed\r\n  an amended complaint on May 9, 2008, to name as defendants only Mrs. Coffey and\r\n  Bank of America, N.A.&nbsp; In the meantime, Mrs. Coffey had filed with the\r\n  Beaufort County Probate Court an inventory and appraisement of Dr. Coffey's\r\n  estate in September 2006.&nbsp; The inventory and appraisement acknowledged Dr.\r\n  Coffey's and Mrs. Coffey's joint ownership of the boat.&nbsp; The inventory and\r\n  appraisement also indicated that Dr. Coffey's probate estate had a negative\r\n  value.&nbsp; Mrs. Coffey admitted that most of Dr. Coffey's assets had been\r\n  transferred to her and other family members outside the probate estate through\r\n  a marital trust.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn its amended complaint,\r\n  Wachovia sought to foreclose on the mortgage signed by Dr. Coffey and asserted\r\n  additional causes of action for ratification, prejudgment interest, unjust\r\n  enrichment, equitable lien, and equitable mortgage.&nbsp; Wachovia filed a\r\n  motion for summary judgment on the unjust enrichment, equitable lien, and\r\n  prejudgment interest causes of action, and Mrs. Coffey filed a cross-motion for\r\n  summary judgment on all of Wachovia's causes of action. &nbsp;The master\r\n  granted Mrs. Coffeyâ€™s summary judgment motion and denied Wachoviaâ€™s summary\r\n  judgment motion.&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp; \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL \r\nIs Wachovia barred from seeking\r\n  relief in the courts due to its unauthorized practice of law in the loan\r\n  transaction with Dr. Coffey ?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  this Court applies the same standard as that required for the circuit court\r\n  under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688,\r\n  692 (2000).&nbsp; &quot;'Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.'&quot;&nbsp; Adamson\r\n    v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 332 S.C. 121, 124, 503\r\n  S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998) (quoting Tupper\r\n    v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487\r\n  S.E.2d 187&nbsp;(1997)).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWachovia assigns error to the\r\n  master's granting of summary judgment to Mrs. Coffey on the claim that she\r\n  ratified the note and mortgage signed by Dr. Coffey.&nbsp; Wachovia argues that\r\n  there was a genuine dispute about the inferences to be drawn from the evidence\r\n  pertaining to this claim.&nbsp; Wachovia also assigns error to the master's\r\n  grant of Mrs. Coffey's summary judgment motion and denial of its summary\r\n  judgment motion on its causes of action for unjust enrichment, equitable lien,\r\n  and prejudgment interest.&nbsp; \r\nHowever, Mrs. Coffey asserts that\r\n  the doctrine of unclean hands bars Wachovia from seeking equitable relief from\r\n  our courts.[1]&nbsp; She argues that Wachovia\r\n  committed the unauthorized practice of law, and, therefore, Wachovia came into\r\n  court with unclean hands.&nbsp; We agree.[2]\r\n&quot;The doctrine of\r\n  unclean hands precludes a plaintiff from recovering in equity if he acted\r\n  unfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation to the prejudice of\r\n  the defendant.&quot;&nbsp; First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333\r\n  S.C. 554, 568, 511 S.E.2d 372, 379&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).&nbsp; &quot;The\r\n  expression 'clean hands' means a clean record with respect to the transaction\r\n  with the defendants themselves and not with respect to others.&quot; &nbsp;Arnold\r\n    v. City of Spartanburg, 201 S.C. 523, 532, 23 S.E.2d 735,\r\n  738&nbsp;(1943).&nbsp; The rule must be understood to refer to some misconduct\r\n  concerning the matter in litigation of which the opposing party can, in good\r\n  conscience, complain in a court of equity.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; \r\nAs early as 1987, lending\r\n  institutions doing business in South Carolina were on\r\n  notice that they could not prepare legal documents in connection with a\r\n  mortgage loan without review by an independent attorney and that the loan\r\n  closing had to be supervised by an attorney.&nbsp; See State v.\r\n    Buyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. 426, 431-434, 357 S.E.2d 15,\r\n  18-19&nbsp;(1987)&nbsp;(holding that a commercial title company's employment of\r\n  attorneys to review mortgage loan closing documents did not save the company's\r\n  preparation of those documents from constituting the unauthorized practice of\r\n  law and that the closings should be conducted only under an attorney's\r\n  supervision), modified by Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 585 S.E.2d\r\n  773&nbsp;(2003); see also Doe Law Firm v. Richardson, 371 S.C.\r\n  14, 17, 636 S.E.2d 866, 868&nbsp;(2006) (citing Buyers and McMaster) (clarifying that a lender may prepare legal documents for use in financing or refinancing a real\r\n  property loan as long as an independent attorney reviews them and makes any\r\n  corrections necessary to ensure their compliance with the law and reaffirming\r\n  that mortgage loan closings should be conducted only under an attorney's\r\n  supervision).[3]\r\nHere, on July 23,\r\n  2001, Wachovia's employees processed the home equity loan to Dr. Coffey without\r\n  the supervision of an attorney.&nbsp; Their unauthorized practice of law\r\n  resulted in prejudice to Mrs. Coffey when the mortgage signed by Dr. Coffey was\r\n  recorded and when Wachovia filed this foreclosure action against Mrs.\r\n  Coffey.&nbsp; While Mrs. Coffey could have applied the proceeds from the sale\r\n  of the boat to the balance due on the boat loan, we cannot allow her failure to\r\n  do so to obscure the misconduct of Wachovia's employees.&nbsp; The unauthorized\r\n  practice of law is inherently prejudicial to not only the parties involved in\r\n  the instant transaction but also to the public at large for the reason so\r\n  cogently stated in Buyers:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    reason preparation of instruments by lay persons must be held to constitute the\r\n    unauthorized practice of law is not for the economic protection of the legal\r\n    profession. Rather, it is for the protection of the public from the potentially\r\n    severe economic and emotional consequences which may flow from erroneous advice\r\n    given by persons untrained in the law.\r\n\r\nBuyers,\r\n  292 S.C. at 431, 357 S.E.2d at 18.&nbsp; We therefore reach the inescapable\r\n  conclusion that Wachovia has come to court with unclean hands and is barred\r\n  from seeking equitable relief.\r\nWachovia's legal causes\r\n  of action are barred as well.&nbsp; In Linder v. Ins. Claims Consultants,\r\n    Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 560 S.E.2d 612 (2002), our supreme court refused to\r\n  allow a public insurance-adjusting business to be compensated for the value of\r\n  its performance attributable to the unauthorized practice of law.&nbsp; Linder,\r\n  348 S.C. at 496, 560 S.E.2d at 622.&nbsp; This is consistent with South\r\n  Carolina precedent asserting that no person be permitted to acquire a right of\r\n  action from their own unlawful act and that one who participates in an unlawful\r\n  act cannot recover damages for the consequence of that act.&nbsp; See Jackson\r\n    v.

(Minor) was tried and convicted in the family court of first-degree\r\n  burglary, grand larceny, and malicious injury to personal property.Â  Minor\r\n  appeals from the family court's denial of his directed verdict motion, arguing\r\n  the State's case was based on inadmissible evidence or evidence admitted for\r\n  reasons other than to substantively prove his guilt.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMinor\r\n  was accused of robbing Wanda Izzard's home on the evening of December 14, 2005.Â \r\n  At trial, Izzard testified that when she returned home from work a little after\r\n  10 p.m., she notice broken glass from one of her windows.Â  She called 911 and\r\n  went to her neighbor's house to wait for police to arrive.Â  Izzard indicated\r\n  that a heavy gun cabinet containing three shotguns was missing along with piggy\r\n  banks containing some change and a cigar box holding some two dollar bills and\r\n  rare coins.Â  Izzard further stated she had reported to the police information she\r\n  had learned from her neighbors regarding who may have been involved in the robbery\r\n  and told police they could obtain a copy of a videotape from a local\r\n  convenience store where money taken from her house may have been spent.Â  \r\nDetective\r\n  Charles Lawrence testified he became involved with the investigation and an anonymous\r\n  informant from the neighborhood told him he had seen Minor and Eric,[1] another boy\r\n  implicated in the crime, with the guns, and the guns were hidden in the woods.Â \r\n  Minor objected to this testimony arguing it constituted hearsay and violated\r\n  the confrontation clause.Â  The State maintained the information was offered\r\n  only to show the course of the police investigation, not to prove the truth of\r\n  the matter asserted.Â  Minor's objection was overruled.Â  \r\nDetective\r\n  Lawrence testified he spoke with a cashier at a local convenience store and the\r\n  cashier told him two boys had come in the night of the robbery and spent some two\r\n  dollar bills.Â  Minor also objected to this statement on hearsay and\r\n  confrontation clause grounds and was overruled.Â  Detective Lawrence stated he then\r\n  reviewed surveillance video from that night and pulled still photographs showing\r\n  Eric and Minor at the store.Â  Minor objected to the admission of the photographs\r\n  arguing the State did not offer a sufficient foundation for their admission, they\r\n  were more prejudicial than probative, and they violated the best evidence\r\n  rule.Â  Minor's objection was overruled.\r\n Detective\r\n  Lawrence testified he interviewed Eric at his school.Â  According to Detective\r\n  Lawrence, Eric indicated he was at Izzard's home at around 8:30 p.m. the night\r\n  of the robbery and served as lookout for Minor and possibly another boy, Shawn,\r\n  who went inside and took three guns.[2]Â \r\n  Eric further stated he and Minor went to the store and he spent one of the two\r\n  dollar bills taken from Izzard's residence.\r\nThe\r\n  State called Eric as a witness, who was antagonistic and contrary during his\r\n  testimony.Â  The State eventually treated him as a hostile witness.Â  Eric\r\n  testified that when first interviewed by Detective Lawrence at school, he drew\r\n  a grid pattern on a piece of paper and Detective Lawrence threw the paper in\r\n  the trash.[3]Â \r\n  Eric further testified Detective Lawrence then put a piece of paper in front of\r\n  him and told him to sign it.Â  He denied Minor was involved in the robbery.Â  Eric\r\n  also testified he had never told Detective Lawrence Minor was involved.[4]Â  The State\r\n  offered Eric's prior inconsistent statement to impeach his in-court testimony.Â \r\n  Over Minor's objection, the statement was admitted.Â  \r\nMinor\r\n  moved for directed verdict at the close of the State's case, arguing the\r\n  State's case hinged on evidence that could not be considered to substantively\r\n  establish Minor's guilt.Â  The family court denied the motion, relying on Eric's\r\n  statement, his credibility on the witness stand, and the photographs from the\r\n  convenience store.Â  Minor was convicted of all charges and this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  considering the grant or denial of a motion for directed verdict, the trial\r\n  court is concerned with the existence of evidence as opposed to the weight of\r\n  the evidence.Â  State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 624, 677 S.E.2d 603,\r\n  605 (2009).Â  &quot;A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the\r\n  [S]tate fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  When reviewing the denial of a directed verdict motion, an appellate court\r\n  views the evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom in\r\n  the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMinor contends the family court erred in denying his\r\n  motion for directed verdict.Â  He argues Eric's prior inconsistent statement was\r\n  admitted only for impeachment purposes and should not have been considered by\r\n  the family court as substantive evidence in a directed verdict motion analysis.[5]Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982), the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court adopted the position that prior inconsistent statements,\r\n  previously only used for impeachment, could be considered as substantive\r\n  evidence.\r\n\r\n  Heretofore,\r\n          South Carolina has followed the traditional rule that testimony of inconsistent\r\n          statements is admissible only to impeach the credibility of the witness. Â Henceforth\r\n          from today, we will allow testimony of prior inconsistent statements to be used\r\n          as substantive evidence when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject\r\n            to cross examination.\r\n\r\nId. at 581,\r\n  300 S.E.2d at 69 (emphasis added).\r\nSince\r\n  its adoption, this rule has been applied in a myriad of cases.Â  See State v.\r\n    Smith, 309 S.C. 442, 447-48, 424 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1992) (holding exclusion\r\n  of defendant's nephew's prior inconsistent statement constituted reversible\r\n  error); State v. Ferguson, 300 S.C. 408, 411, 388 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1990)\r\n  (finding exclusion of victim's prior inconsistent statement as substantive\r\n  evidence was harmless error when other evidence was cumulative of statement); State\r\n    v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 634, 608 S.E.2d 886, 890 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (holding co-conspirator's later testimony did not obviate the efficacy of the\r\n  first statement made closer in time to the event in question); State v.\r\n    Caulder, 287 S.C. 507, 513, 339 S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding\r\n  court erred in instructing jury to disregard witness's prior inconsistent\r\n  statement for substantive purposes).\r\nAlso\r\n  informing our decision is State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 673 S.E.2d 434 (2009).Â  In Stokes, the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court concluded the rule set forth in Copeland was not\r\n  offended because at trial the witness denied making the prior statement.Â  Stokes,\r\n  381 S.C. at 403-04, 673 S.E.2d at 440-41.Â  The court concluded the opportunity to cross-examine the witness was the protection afforded by the Sixth Amendment\r\n  and that opportunity was provided to Stokes even though he elected not to\r\n  cross-examine the witness as part of his trial strategy.Â  Id. at 401-02,\r\n  673 S.E.2d at 439-40.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, we agree with Minor the State offered the statement only to impeach Eric's\r\n  credibility.Â  However, the family court never actually stated any limitation on\r\n  the admission of the evidence.Â  Even if the family court had limited the\r\n  admissibility of the statement, that does not negate the fact that\r\n  consideration of the statement as substantive evidence in a directed verdict\r\n  analysis would have been proper under Copeland and Stokes.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Minor argues the family court erred in allowing the State to call Eric as a\r\n  witness at trial.Â  Minor contends the State sought solely to elicit unfavorable\r\n  testimony so it could impeach Eric with the prior statement.Â  A bench\r\n  conference was held off the record after the State began inquiring of Eric if\r\n  he planned to testify truthfully.Â  This issue may have been discussed at that\r\n  time, but we cannot review issues not contained in the record.Â  See State\r\n    v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 361, 543 S.E.2d 586, 595 (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;An\r\n  objection made during an off-the-record conference which is not made part of\r\n  the record does not preserve the question for review.&quot;), overruled on\r\n  other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  Because\r\n  the issue was never raised to and ruled upon by the family court on the record,\r\n  it is unpreserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding issues\r\n  not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate\r\n  review).\r\nFinally,\r\n  Minor argues the family court erred in failing to grant its directed verdict\r\n  motion as to grand larceny when the State failed to present evidence the items\r\n  stolen from Izzard were worth more than one thousand dollars.Â  This issue is\r\n  not preserved for our review because it was not raised at trial.Â  See Guider\r\n    v. Churpeyes, Inc., 370 S.C. 424, 430 n.2, 635 S.E.2d 562, 566 n.2 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (finding defendant did not preserve argument regarding malice and\r\n  damages in malicious prosecution claim when failure to meet those elements was\r\n  not argued in directed verdict motion); see also Scoggins v.\r\n    McClellion, 321 S.C. 264, 267, 468 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding\r\n  defendant did not preserve argument regarding element of negligence in tort\r\n  claim when only causation and punitive damages were raised in directed verdict\r\n  motion); Hendrix v. E. Distribution, Inc., 316 S.C. 34, 44, 446 S.E.2d\r\n  440, 446 (Ct. App. 1994) (&quot;It was incumbent upon [Appellant] to argue\r\n  specifically which element of breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\n  act was not established to give the trial court the opportunity to rule on the\r\n  point.&quot;). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nEric's\r\n  prior inconsistent statement could have been considered as substantive evidence\r\n  by the family court pursuant to the holdings in Copeland and Stokes.Â \r\n  That statement coupled with an evaluation of Eric's credibility at trial\r\n  provided sufficient evidence to withstand Minor's directed verdict motion.Â  His\r\n  specific motion regarding the grand larceny charge is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  Accordingly, the family court's denial of Minor's directed verdict\r\n  motion is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We omit Eric's last name to protect his identity as he is also a minor.\r\n[2] Eric's statement\r\n  is not included in the record on appeal.Â  However, we are able to review Detective\r\n  Lawrence's testimony regarding the statement to discern its contents.\r\n[3] Detective Lawrence\r\n  testified he advised Eric of his Miranda rights prior to questioning him.Â \r\n  That point is not raised in this appeal.\r\n[4] Eric admitted\r\n  telling a Deputy Sheppard some facts the day before that were included in the\r\n  statement made to Detective Lawrence.Â  Those facts included that he had given\r\n  the guns to his uncle, he had known Izzard for a few months, and she lived at\r\n  the address where the robbery occurred.Â  \r\n[5] The family\r\n  court denied Minor's directed verdict motion based on the photographs from the convenience\r\n  store and Eric's prior inconsistent statement and credibility on the witness\r\n  stand.Â  Minor argues on appeal the convenience store photographs and\r\n  &quot;hearsay&quot; statements by Detective Lawrence were inadmissible.Â \r\n  However, at oral argument Minor withdrew any request for a new trial that might\r\n  result from a finding such evidence was erroneously admitted.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  limit our review to whether there was sufficient evidence properly admitted to\r\n  overcome Minor's directed verdict motion.Â  Because we find Eric's prior\r\n  inconsistent statement and trial testimony to be sufficient, we need not\r\n  address whether the admission of the &quot;hearsay&quot; statements and\r\n  photographs was error.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding the court need\r\n  not rule on remaining issues when the disposition of prior issues is\r\n  dispositive).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4687","title":"State v.

Taylor appeals his conviction and thirty-year sentence for possession with intent\r\n  to distribute (PWID) cocaine base, arguing the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  the drug evidence because the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him or\r\n  probable cause to search his tennis ball.Â  We agree.Â  Therefore, we reverse Taylor's conviction and vacate his\r\n  sentence.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  July 25, 2006, between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m., Florence County Sheriff's Deputy\r\n  Toby Bellamy received an anonymous tip indicating &quot;a black male on a\r\n  bicycle . . . [was] possibly selling dope&quot; on the &quot;dirt portion of\r\n  Ervin Street.&quot;Â  The tip did not include a clothing description.Â  Bellamy\r\n  drove his patrol car down Gilyard Street, which intersects Ervin Street, and\r\n  observed a black male, later identified as Taylor, riding a bicycle on the dirt\r\n  road.Â  Bellamy testified he decided to approach the area on foot to &quot;see\r\n  exactly what was basically going on.&quot; Â Bellamy and Lieutenant Darren\r\n  Yarborough walked toward the intersection of Ervin and Gilyard Streets.Â  As they\r\n  turned onto Ervin Street from Gilyard Street, Bellamy again observed Taylor on\r\n  a bicycle, this time &quot;huddled close together&quot; with another black male.Â \r\n  As the officers approached, Bellamy did not witness anything pass between the\r\n  two men.Â  However, Bellamy testified when Taylor and his companion noticed the\r\n  officers nearing, Taylor mounted his bicycle and rode toward Bellamy, while the\r\n  other individual walked in the opposite direction toward the wooded area.Â \r\n  Taylor pedaled past Bellamy on his bicycle, glanced at him, and Bellamy ordered\r\n  him to stop.Â  When Taylor ignored Bellamy's second command to stop and get on\r\n  the ground, Bellamy conducted an arm-bar takedown.Â  As a result, Taylor was\r\n  forced off his bicycle and onto the ground.Â  Once apprehended, Bellamy searched\r\n  Taylor and discovered a tennis ball containing crack cocaine.\r\nTaylor\r\n  was arrested and charged with PWID cocaine base.Â  At trial, Taylor sought to\r\n  exclude the drug evidence, arguing the stop, search, and arrest were unlawful.Â \r\n  During an in camera hearing, Bellamy testified to receiving an\r\n  anonymous tip of possible drug activity in an area known for previous drug\r\n  related incidents; observing Taylor on a bicycle where the tipster indicated; approaching\r\n  Taylor on foot; and witnessing Taylor engrossed in a close conversation with\r\n  another individual.[2]Â \r\n  Additionally, Bellamy indicated Taylor's close proximity to the other man led\r\n  him to suspect illegal drug activity; he stated:Â  &quot;in [his] line of work\r\n  and with recent experiences . . . any time two males [were] that close huddled\r\n  up [they were] trying to hide something . . . [and] 90 percent of the time[,] .\r\n  . . some sort of illegal activity [was] going on.&quot;Â  He stated Taylor\r\n  pedaled his bicycle as if he would not stop when riding away from his companion\r\n  and toward the officers.Â  Accordingly, Bellamy ordered Taylor to put his hands\r\n  up and get on the ground to ensure the officers' safety and because Bellamy\r\n  believed that he had probable cause drug activity might be taking place.Â  \r\nTaylor\r\n  argued the drug evidence should be suppressed based on Florida v. J.L.,\r\n  529 U.S. 266 (2000), and State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 532 S.E.2d 896\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Specifically, he maintained this incident arose as the result\r\n  of an unreliable anonymous tip.Â  Additionally, he alleged he was within his\r\n  rights to decline to stop after Bellamy's command. Â Taylor also asserted the\r\n  officers failed to observe him engaged in any illegal activity. Â He contended the\r\n  anonymous tip and being in close proximity to somebody while in a high-crime\r\n  area did not rise to reasonable suspicion.\r\nThe\r\n  State averred the following circumstances constituted reasonable suspicion to stop\r\n  Taylor:Â  (1) the anonymous tip; (2) the area being known for drug related\r\n  incidents; (3) Taylor's close conversation with another individual was denotative\r\n  of criminal activity; (4) Taylor's companion's departure toward the woods when\r\n  the officers approached; and (5) Taylor's getting on his bicycle and pedaling toward\r\n  the officer &quot;like [he was] not going to stop.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  State insisted these facts were distinguishable from J.L. and Green because Taylor's close conversation suggested criminal activity, he departed the\r\n  scene only when he noticed the officers, and he ignored the officers' commands\r\n  to stop.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court admitted the drug evidence, finding the stop was based on more than\r\n  the anonymous tip.[3]Â \r\n  The trial judge referred to the officers' observations, the high-crime nature\r\n  of the area, and Taylor's close proximity to his companion.Â  While conceding\r\n  Taylor's reasonable suspicion argument was persuasive, the court nevertheless believed\r\n  the tipster's anonymity affected the credibility and the weight of the\r\n  evidence, not its existence.[4]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Bellamy and Yarborough testified at trial regarding the circumstances\r\n  surrounding Taylor's arrest.Â  At the close of the State's case, Taylor renewed\r\n  his prior objections and the trial court reiterated its previous denial of\r\n  Taylor's motion to suppress.Â  The jury convicted Taylor of PWID cocaine base,\r\n  and the trial court sentenced him to thirty years' imprisonment.[5]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;[T]he\r\n  appellate standard of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is\r\n  limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial court's finding\r\n  and the appellate court may only reverse where there is clear error.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 219 n.3, 532 S.E.2d 896, 898 n.3 (Ct. App. 2000); accord State v. Sanders, Op. No. 4527 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 7, 2009)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 80); State v. Willard, 374 S.C. 129, 133,\r\n  647 S.E.2d 252, 255 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTaylor\r\n  argues the trial court erred in admitting the drug evidence because the\r\n  officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n&quot;A\r\n  police officer may stop and briefly detain and question a person for\r\n  investigative purposes, without treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when\r\n  the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of\r\n  probable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal\r\n  activity.&quot;Â  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 248, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  535, 539 (Ct. App. 1999); see also U.S. v. Sokolow, 490\r\n  U.S. 1, 7 (1989); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968).Â  &quot;Reasonable\r\n  suspicion is a lesser standard than probable cause and allows an officer to\r\n  effectuate a stop when there is some objective manifestation of criminal\r\n  activity involving the person stopped.&quot;Â  State v. Padgett, 354 S.C.\r\n  268, 273, 580 S.E.2d 159, 162 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted); Blassingame,\r\n  338 S.C. at 248, 525 S.E.2d at 539 (&quot;The term 'reasonable suspicion'\r\n  requires a particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect\r\n  another of criminal activity.&quot;) (citing U.S. v. Cortez, 449 U.S.\r\n  411, 417-18 (1981)).Â  When evaluating an investigatory stop's validity, a court\r\n  must consider the totality of circumstances.Â  Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 8.Â  Likewise,\r\n  the court &quot;must require the agent to articulate the factors leading to\r\n  that conclusion.&quot;Â  Id. at 10.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we examine an extensive litany of cases and factors leading to reasonable\r\n  suspicion in order to properly determine the appropriate application of\r\n  reasonable suspicion in the instant matter.\r\nA. Factors Leading to Reasonable Suspicion\r\nWhen\r\n  determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant\r\n  further investigation, officers are not required to ignore the relevant\r\n  characteristics of a location.Â  Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124\r\n  (2000).Â  However, &quot;[a]n individual's presence in an area of expected\r\n  criminal activity, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable,\r\n  particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.&quot;Â  Id. at 124; U.S. v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151, 154 (4th Cir. 1993) (stating a\r\n  defendant's presence in a high crime area does not by itself constitute\r\n  reasonable suspicion, but an officer may consider an area's propensity toward\r\n  criminal activity); accord U.S. v. Sprinkle, 106 F.3d 613, 617\r\n  (4th Cir. 1997) (articulating an individual's presence in a high-crime area,\r\n  without more, will not sustain a finding of reasonable suspicion; however, the\r\n  disposition of an area toward criminal activity may be considered with\r\n  additional particularized factors to support a finding of reasonable\r\n  suspicion).[6]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition to location, &quot;[t]he lateness of the hour is another fact that may\r\n  raise the level of suspicion.&quot;Â  Lender, 985 F.2d at 154 (finding\r\n  the officers' observations of the defendant in a known drug area at approximately\r\n  1 a.m. a factor contributing to reasonable suspicion).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  an individual's innocent and lawful actions may, in certain situations, combine\r\n  to suggest criminal activity.Â  Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 125\r\n  (2000) (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), as an example of\r\n  &quot;conduct justifying the stop [being] ambiguous and susceptible of an\r\n  innocent explanation&quot;).[7]Â \r\n  Specifically, &quot;Terry recognized that the officers could detain the\r\n  individuals to resolve the ambiguity&quot; of their actions.Â  Wardlow,\r\n  528 U.S. at 125.\r\nFor\r\n  example, in U.S. v. Sokolow, the United States Supreme Court found the\r\n  following circumstances established reasonable suspicion to stop Sokolow:\r\n\r\n  (1) he\r\n    paid $2,100 for two airplane tickets from a roll of $20 bills; (2) he traveled\r\n    under a name that did not match the name under which his telephone number was\r\n    listed; (3) his original destination was Miami, a source city for illicit\r\n    drugs; (4) he stayed in Miami for only 48 hours, even though a round-trip\r\n    flight from Honolulu to Miami takes 20 hours; (5) he appeared nervous during\r\n    his trip; and (6) he checked none of his luggage.Â  \r\n\r\n490 U.S. 1, 3 (1989).Â  The\r\n  Court held &quot;[a]ny one of these factors is not by itself proof of any\r\n  illegal conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel.Â  But we think\r\n  taken together they amount to reasonable suspicion.&quot;[8]Â  Id. at 9.\r\nNervous,\r\n  evasive behavior is also considered a pertinent factor when determining\r\n  reasonable suspicion.Â  Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 124.Â  Similarly, evasion can\r\n  contribute to reasonable suspicion.Â  U.S. v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151, 154\r\n  (4th Cir. 1993).\r\nIn Lender,\r\n  officers advanced to a street corner in a neighborhood known for drug activity\r\n  and observed a group of four or five men, including Lender, &quot;huddled on a\r\n  corner.&quot;Â  Id. at 153. The officers saw Lender with his hand\r\n  outstretched and palm up and the other men looking down at his palm's\r\n  contents.Â  Id.Â  As the officers neared, the group of men dispersed and\r\n  Lender &quot;walked away from the officers with his back to them.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The court determined the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop Lender\r\n  because among other things, his evasive conduct failed to dispel their earlier\r\n  suspicions of drug activity.Â  Id. at 154.Â  The court stated:Â \r\n  &quot;Evasive conduct, although stopping short of headlong flight, may inform\r\n  an officer's appraisal of a streetcorner encounter.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nLikewise,\r\n  headlong flight, &quot;the consummate act of evasion,&quot; is suggestive of\r\n  wrongdoing.Â  Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 124.Â  However, flight is not\r\n  necessarily indicative of criminal activity because innocent reasons to depart\r\n  from police exist.Â  Id. at 124-25.Â  Therefore, when an officer\r\n  approaches an individual without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, the\r\n  individual can lawfully ignore the officer.Â  Id. at 125 (&quot;[A]ny 'refusal\r\n  to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification\r\n  needed for a detention or seizure.'Â  But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere\r\n  refusal to cooperate.Â  Flight, by its very nature, is not 'going about one's\r\n  business'; in fact, it is just the opposite.Â  Allowing officers confronted with\r\n  such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate further is quite consistent\r\n  with the individual's right to go about his business or to stay put and remain\r\n  silent in the face of police questioning.&quot; (citations omitted)).[9]Â  \r\nAnother\r\n  factor to consider when determining whether reasonable suspicion has been\r\n  aroused is the existence of a tip and the quality thereof.Â  Third party tips &quot;completely\r\n  lacking in indicia of reliability . . . either warrant no police response or\r\n  require further investigation before a forcible stop of a suspect would be\r\n  authorized.&quot;Â  Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 147 (1972).Â \r\n  Therefore, when &quot;a tip has a relatively low degree of reliability, more\r\n  information [is] required to establish the requisite quantum of suspicion than\r\n  would be required if the tip were more reliable.&quot;Â  Alabama v. White,\r\n  496 U.S. 325, 330 (1990).\r\nIn Adams,\r\n  407 U.S. at 146, the United State Supreme Court found the officer was justified\r\n  in responding to a known informant's tip alleging illegal activity[10] because the officer personally knew the informant, the informant provided tips\r\n  in the past, and the informant &quot;came forward personally to give\r\n  information that was immediately verifiable at the scene.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n  the Court referenced the location,[11] the time of day, and the suspect's behavior[12] as additional justification for the officer's actions.Â  Id. at 147-48.\r\nOn\r\n  the other hand, &quot;reasonable suspicion based solely on a call made from an\r\n  unknown location by an unknown caller lack[s] sufficient indicia of reliability\r\n  to make an investigatory stop.&quot;Â  State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 217,\r\n  532 S.E.2d 896, 897 (Ct. App. 2000); Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 269\r\n  (2000) (&quot;Anonymous tips . . . are generally less reliable than tips from\r\n  known informants and can form the basis for reasonable suspicion only if accompanied by specific indicia of reliability, for example, the correct\r\n  forecast of a subject's 'not easily predicted' movements.&quot; (quoting White,\r\n  496 U.S. at 332) (emphasis added)); Id. at 270 (&quot;Unlike a tip from\r\n  a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held\r\n  responsible if [the] allegations turn out to be [fabrications], 'an anonymous\r\n  tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of knowledge or\r\n  veracity.'&quot;) (citations omitted).Â  Therefore, in order for an anonymous\r\n  tip to justify an investigatory stop, its reliability must be verified. Â White,\r\n  496 U.S. at 330.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  anonymous tips providing readily observable information do not supply\r\n  sufficient indicia of reliability to establish reasonable suspicion to justify\r\n  an investigatory stop.Â  Green, 341 S.C. at 218, 532 S.E.2d at 897.Â  In Green,\r\n  the &quot;officer was notified that a 'black male [named] Alonzo Green was\r\n  leaving the area of Bayside Manor' . . . [with] a large sum of money and\r\n  narcotics.&quot;Â  341 S.C. at 216, 532 S.E.2d at 896.Â  The anonymous tipster\r\n  identified the vehicle Green would be driving as a gray four-door Maxima and\r\n  said Green recently departed Bayside Manor.Â  Id.Â  The officer stopped\r\n  Green, whom he knew by sight, based solely on the anonymous tip.Â  Id.Â \r\n  As he approached Green's vehicle, he noticed Green &quot;fumbling under the\r\n  front seat.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The officer asked Green to exit the vehicle,\r\n  frisked him for weapons, and discovered narcotics and a large sum of money. Â Id.Â \r\n  At trial, Green moved to suppress all evidence found incident to the stop,\r\n  arguing the stop and search violated the Fourth Amendment, to no avail.Â  Id. at 216, 532 S.E.2d at 897.Â  On appellate review, this court determined the\r\n  evidence was erroneously admitted whereas the &quot;only information available\r\n  to the officer was the statement of an unknown, unaccountable informant who\r\n  neither explained how he knew about the money and narcotics, nor supplied any\r\n  basis for the officer to believe he had inside information about Green.&quot; Id. at 218, 532 S.E.2d at 898.Â  Our court stated because the tipster remained\r\n  anonymous, he did not risk his credibility and could lie with impunity; hence,\r\n  because we could not &quot;judge the credibility of the caller, . . . the risk\r\n  of fabrication [became] unacceptable.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  anonymous tip can provide the basis for an investigatory stop if the officer\r\n  conducting the stop verifies the tip's reliability by observing the suspect\r\n  engaged in criminal activity.Â  White, 496 U.S. at 331.Â  In White,\r\n  an officer received an anonymous tip indicating Vanessa White would be leaving\r\n  a particular apartment at a specific time; driving a brown Plymouth station\r\n  wagon with a broken right taillight; and going to a certain motel carrying\r\n  cocaine in a brown case.Â  The officer stopped White after witnessing her leave\r\n  the specified apartment; drive the brown Plymouth station wagon at\r\n  approximately the time the tipster indicated; and travel in the direction of\r\n  the named motel.Â  Id. at 327.Â  Recognizing anonymous tips alone rarely\r\n  demonstrate &quot;the informant's basis of knowledge or veracity inasmuch as\r\n  ordinary citizens generally do not provide extensive recitations of the basis\r\n  of their everyday observations and given that the veracity of persons supplying\r\n  anonymous tips is 'by hypothesis largely unknown, and unknowable,'&quot;Â  Id. at 329 (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 237 (1983)), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court concluded reasonable suspicion existed under the totality\r\n  of the circumstances because &quot;the anonymous tip, as corroborated,\r\n  exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the investigatory stop\r\n  of [White's] car.&quot;Â  Id. at 331-32.\r\nNevertheless, White was a close case because &quot;[k]nowledge about a person's future\r\n  movements indicates some familiarity with that person's affairs, but having\r\n  such knowledge does not necessarily imply that the informant knows, in\r\n  particular, whether that person is carrying hidden contraband.&quot;Â  J.L.,\r\n  529 U.S. at 271.Â  Therefore, &quot;[t]he reasonableness of official suspicion\r\n  must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their\r\n  search.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  order to rely upon an anonymous tip to effectuate a stop, the tip must\r\n  demonstrate knowledge of concealed criminal activity.Â  See Florida v.\r\n    J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 272 (2000).Â  For example, in J.L., officers were\r\n  dispatched to a bus stop after an anonymous caller[13] claimed a young black male wearing a plaid shirt at the bus stop was carrying a\r\n  gun. Â When the officers arrived, they identified an individual matching the\r\n  description, searched him, and uncovered a weapon.Â Â  Id.Â  &quot;Apart\r\n  from the tip, the officers had no reason to suspect any . . . illegal conduct.Â \r\n  The officers did not see a firearm, and J.L. made no threatening or otherwise\r\n  unusual movements.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Thus, the officers' suspicion arose solely\r\n  from the anonymous tip, not any perceptions of their own.Â  Id. at 270.Â  \r\nEmphasizing\r\n  an anonymous tip's need to demonstrate knowledge of concealed criminal\r\n  activity, the court elucidated:\r\n\r\n  An accurate\r\n    description of a subject's readily observable location and appearance is of\r\n    course reliable in this limited sense:Â  It will help the police correctly\r\n    identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse.Â  Such a tip, however,\r\n    does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity.Â \r\n    The reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its\r\n    assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate\r\n    person.\r\n\r\nId. at 272.Â  The court held &quot;an anonymous tip\r\n  lacking indicia of reliability of the kind contemplated in Adams v. Williams,\r\n  407 U.S. 143 (1972), and Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990), does not\r\n  justify a stop and frisk whenever and however it alleges the illegal possession\r\n  of a firearm.&quot;[14]Â  Id.\r\nAn\r\n  additional factor to consider when determining whether reasonable suspicion\r\n  exists is the officer's experience and intuition.Â  See Illinois v.\r\n    Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 125 (2000) (&quot;[T]he determination of reasonable\r\n  suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human\r\n  behavior.&quot;).Â  Nevertheless, &quot;a wealth of experience will [not]\r\n  overcome a complete absence of articulable facts.&quot;Â  U.S. v. McCoy,\r\n  513 F.3d 405, 415 (4th Cir. 2008) (noting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1\r\n  (1968), &quot;clearly requires that an officer . . . 'must be able to point to\r\n  specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences\r\n  from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion'&quot; in order to briefly\r\n  detain or frisk an individual (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21)).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  an officer's impression that an individual is engaged in criminal activity,\r\n  without confirmation, does not amount to reasonable suspicion.Â  U.S. v.\r\n    Sprinkle, 106 F.3d 613, 617 (4th Cir. 1997).\r\nIn Sprinkle,\r\n  two officers in a high-crime neighborhood observed Victor Poindexter sitting in\r\n  a parked vehicle.Â  Id. at 615.Â  Officer Daniel Riccio knew Poindexter\r\n  was recently released from prison after serving time for narcotics violations,\r\n  but &quot;had no reports of any criminal activity by Poindexter since his\r\n  release.&quot;Â  Id. at 615-16.Â  Riccio noticed Sprinkle, whom he did not\r\n  know, get into the passenger seat of Poindexter's vehicle.Â  Id. at 616.Â \r\n  As Riccio walked by the driver's side of Poindexter's vehicle to his patrol car,\r\n  he &quot;noticed Sprinkle 'huddling and talking to [] Poindexter' . . . [toward]\r\n  'the console of the vehicle' with their hands 'close[] together.'&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  When Poindexter saw Riccio, he put his head down, covering the left side of his\r\n  face with his hand as if to conceal his identity.Â  Id.Â  Because it was a\r\n  fairly bright day with plenty of sunlight, Riccio &quot;did not see anything in\r\n  either man's hands.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, neither officer viewed &quot;any\r\n  drugs, money, guns, or drug paraphernalia in the car . . . [and] Poindexter and\r\n  Sprinkle did not make any movement that indicated an attempt to conceal any\r\n  object inside the car.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The officers continued to their\r\n  patrol cars, and Poindexter started his vehicle, pulling it into the street, and\r\n  drove away in a normal, unsuspicious fashion.Â  Id.Â  After Poindexter\r\n  drove approximately 150 feet, an unrelated traffic stop blocked his route.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Seizing the opportunity, the officers parked behind Poindexter's stopped vehicle,\r\n  engaged their blue lights, exited the patrol car, and approached.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Riccio informed Sprinkle he was going to pat him down for weapons.Â  Id.Â \r\n  As Riccio began the pat-down, Sprinkle pushed away and began to run.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Sprinkle brandished a handgun during the foot chase and was ultimately detained\r\n  and charged with possessing a handgun.Â  Id.\r\nAt trial, Sprinkle\r\n  moved to suppress the handgun's admission, declaring it was the fruit of an\r\n  unlawful stop.Â  Id.Â  The trial court granted the motion and dismissed\r\n  his indictment.Â  Id.Â  The government appealed, professing five factors combined\r\n  to establish reasonable suspicion: Â (1) the officer's knowledge of Poindexter's\r\n  criminal record and narcotics history; (2) the neighborhood being known for narcotics\r\n  activity; (3) the two men huddled together in the vehicle &quot;with their\r\n  hands close together&quot;; (4) Poindexter's attempt to hide his identity from\r\n  Riccio; and (5) Poindexter's departure &quot;as soon as the officers walked by\r\n  the car.&quot;Â  Id. at 617.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Fourth\r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the known prior criminal history of an\r\n  individual was insufficient to create reasonable suspicion, but the knowledge could\r\n  be combined with more concrete factors to constitute reasonable suspicion of\r\n  current criminal activity.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the court recognized the\r\n  high-crime nature of the neighborhood could not provide independent or\r\n  freestanding grounds for reasonable suspicion, and noted Riccio viewed\r\n  Poindexter and Sprinkle at 5:30 p.m. on a sunny day.Â  Id. Â Â The court\r\n  mentioned the government maintained the particular acts of suspicious behavior initiated\r\n  with the two men huddling toward the center console of the vehicle with their\r\n  hands close together, and the acts gave Riccio &quot;'the impression that they\r\n  were in the midst of a narcotics transaction.'&quot;Â  Id. at 617.Â  However,\r\n  the court held &quot;it would take more for this impression to qualify as a\r\n  reasonable suspicion.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court concluded hiding one's face &quot;is\r\n  an act that may be appraised with others in deciding whether suspicion reaches\r\n  the threshold of reasonableness.&quot;Â  Id. at 618.Â  Similarly, the\r\n  court determined Poindexter's departure was not evasive because he &quot;drove\r\n  off right after his passenger got in the car, and the officers admitted that he\r\n  drove in a normal, unhurried manner.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Ultimately, the court ascertained\r\n  the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Sprinkle.[15]Â  Id. at 618-19.Â  While acknowledging Riccio's curiosity was\r\n  understandably aroused upon seeing Poindexter in a neighborhood with high\r\n  narcotics activity, the court avowed the officers needed additional\r\n  particularized evidence to indicate criminal activity.Â  Id. at 618.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, the court declined to find their huddling together, Poindexter's\r\n  attempt to hide his face from Riccio, or their departure established reasonable\r\n  suspicion.Â  Id.Â  Significantly, the court reiterated Riccio could see\r\n  inside Poindexter's vehicle and observed nothing of a criminal nature taking\r\n  place or any attempt to conceal criminal activity.Â  Id. at 618.\r\nSprinkle differed\r\n  from U.S. v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151 (4th Cir. 1993), because &quot;although\r\n  the police could not see . . . into Lender's open hand, the fact that several\r\n  men were looking to his hand indicated there was actually something in\r\n  it.&quot;Â  Id. at 619 n.3.Â  In Sprinkle, &quot;Riccio's initial\r\n  suspicion that Sprinkle was about to pass something to Poindexter was simply\r\n  not confirmed by what Riccio actually saw&quot; when the officers were close\r\n  enough to see both men's hands.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, Lender exhibited\r\n  evasive conduct by turning his back and walking away from the approaching\r\n  officers, whereas Poindexter did not.Â  Id.Â  Also, while &quot;Poindexter\r\n  was parked in broad daylight on a busy street,&quot; Lender was observed on the\r\n  street corner at 1:00 a.m.; therefore, the lateness of the hour contributed to\r\n  reasonable suspicion to stop Lender.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the court found Lender was distinguishable and not controlling.Â  Id.\r\nB. Application of Reasonable Suspicion Factors in the\r\n  Instant Matter\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Deputy Bellamy stated his belief that Taylor was involved in\r\n  criminal activity was based on: Â (1) the anonymous tip; (2) Taylor's presence in\r\n  an area associated with high crime; (3) Taylor's closeness to his companion;\r\n  and (4) each man's departure from the scene when the officers approached.[16]Â \r\n  We find the anonymous tip Bellamy relied on was one in which the reliability could\r\n  not be tested because the tipster was nameless, the tipster's location was\r\n  unidentified, the tipster remained unaccountable, and the tipster failed to\r\n  explain the origin of the allegation of criminal activity, provide any\r\n  predictive information, or supply a basis for believing the tipster possessed\r\n  inside information into Taylor's affairs.Â  Furthermore, the tip failed to\r\n  provide any specific information indicating the tipster's knowledge of\r\n  concealed criminal activity; therefore, the tipster did not risk his or her\r\n  credibility and was free to fabricate the information with impunity.Â  The tip\r\n  described readily observable information, such as the individual's location and\r\n  appearance, and stated the individual was possibly selling drugs.Â  While\r\n  the anonymous tip was trustworthy in the limited sense it assisted Bellamy in\r\n  identifying Taylor as a person matching the description of the individual whom\r\n  the tipster wished to accuse, the tip demonstrated neither an extensive degree\r\n  of familiarity with Taylor's actions, nor any independent reliability in terms\r\n  of the alleged possibility of criminal activity as required by Florida v.\r\n    J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 272 (2000).Â  Therefore, due to the tip's inherent unreliability,\r\n  the tip was merely a conclusory allegation and more information was required to\r\n  establish the requisite quantum of suspicion before the officers were entitled\r\n  to stop Taylor.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the officers were on Ervin Street based solely on the anonymous and unreliable\r\n  tip and made no supplemental observations suggesting any illegal activity was\r\n  afoot.Â  The officers' observations did nothing more than confirm the readily noticeable\r\n  conditions communicated by the anonymous tipster.[17]Â \r\n  Additionally, Bellamy's initial suspicion remained unsubstantiated when he failed\r\n  to observe Taylor behave in a way to suggest drug activity. Â Hence, this scenario\r\n  involved an anonymous tip far less specific than the tip in State v. Green,\r\n  341 S.C. 214, 532 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  There, the officer knew the\r\n  individual's gender, race, name, point of origin, the model and color of his\r\n  vehicle, and that he would be carrying a large sum of money and narcotics.Â  Id. at 216, 532 S.E.2d at 896.Â  Here, the officers knew a nameless tipster suspected\r\n  a black man riding a bicycle on the dirt portion of Ervin Street might be selling drugs.Â  The tipster failed to supply a specific description of the\r\n  individual other than his general mode of transportation, his readily-observable\r\n  location, his gender, and his race.Â  Accordingly, we find the anonymous tip lacked\r\n  the requisite indicia of reliability to be employed as reasonable suspicion for\r\n  conducting an investigatory stop.\r\nAlthough our courts\r\n  have recognized the nature of the neighborhood as a contributing factor for\r\n  reasonable suspicion, our courts have specifically stated an individual's mere presence\r\n  in an area associated with high-crime is not reasonable suspicion for an\r\n  investigatory stop.[18]Â \r\n  Thus, Taylor's presence on Ervin Street alone did not give rise to reasonable\r\n  suspicion.Â  We also find the high-crime nature of the area failed to\r\n  corroborate the anonymous tipster's information so as to impart a degree of\r\n  reliability to the other allegations contained in the tip.[19]Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we find the close conversation between Taylor and his companion also did not enhance\r\n  the officers' curiosities to the level of &quot;reasonable suspicion.&quot;[20]Â \r\n  Deputy Bellamy did not testify he saw anything pass between the two men when he\r\n  noticed them &quot;huddled&quot; close together, nor did he witness Taylor\r\n  attempt to conceal anything.Â  While Bellamy's curiosity was understandably\r\n  aroused after observing an individual matching the description given by the\r\n  anonymous tipster engaged in a close conversation with another male in an area\r\n  known to have previous drug activity at night, we find the officers needed additional\r\n  particularized facts indicating criminal activity in order to support a finding\r\n  of reasonable suspicion.Â  Moreover, we find because the officers lacked\r\n  reasonable suspicion to stop Taylor, his riding his bicycle toward the officers\r\n  was lawful.Â  See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 125 (2000)\r\n  (maintaining an individual can lawfully ignore an officer if the officer\r\n  approaches without reasonable suspicion or probable cause).Â  Furthermore, we emphasize\r\n  Taylor was neither pedaling abnormally fast nor riding away from the officers;\r\n  thus, his departure was not indicative of evasion or flight.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we find this situation differs considerably from U.S. v. Lender, 985\r\n  F.2d 151 (4th Cir. 1993).Â  While Taylor and his friend were talking in close\r\n  proximity, the officers lacked the additional observation of an action by\r\n  Taylor to insinuate his involvement in criminal activity.Â  Moreover, Taylor's\r\n  actions of concluding his conversation, departing from his companion, and\r\n  riding his bicycle toward the officers cannot be characterized as evasive\r\n  behavior to confirm Bellamy's hunch that Taylor was engaged in criminal activity.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we distinguish this case from Lender.Â  Taylor was in a\r\n  close conversation, but with only one other individual, and he was in a\r\n  high-crime area at a late hour; however, unlike Lender, Taylor exhibited no\r\n  behavior suggesting criminal activity.Â  We do not find Taylor's presence in a\r\n  high-crime area at a late hour while engaged in a close conversation with\r\n  another individual indicative of criminal activity.\r\nUltimately,\r\n  we find U.S. v. Sprinkle, 106 F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1997), is sufficiently\r\n  similar to this case and compels a finding that the officers lacked reasonable\r\n  suspicion to stop Taylor.Â  First, in both cases, the initial suspicion of\r\n  illegal activity resulting from the two men's closeness was not confirmed by the\r\n  officers' observations.Â  Here, Bellamy suspected Taylor was engrossed in\r\n  criminal activity after observing Taylor's close conversation with another\r\n  individual; however, Bellamy stated he did not see anything pass between Taylor\r\n  and his companion.Â  Thus, Bellamy failed to observe Taylor attempt to conceal\r\n  criminal activity and Bellamy's suspicions remained unsubstantiated.Â  Second, both\r\n  Sprinkle and Taylor possessed the right to depart the scene; therefore, neither\r\n  engaged in evasive behavior or flight.Â  Additionally, in both scenarios, the\r\n  neighborhood was considered a high-crime area.Â  In fact, in Sprinkle, Riccio's\r\n  personal knowledge of Poindexter's previous narcotics violations was more\r\n  specific and credible than the anonymous tipster's description of a readily\r\n  observable situation in the instant case.Â  Although we recognize the time of\r\n  day in Sprinkle was four-and-a-half to five hours earlier than the case sub judice, we do not find the time of day significant enough to weigh in\r\n  favor of finding Bellamy demonstrated the necessary amount of reasonable\r\n  suspicion to stop Taylor.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nMindful\r\n  of our &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of review,[21] we find no reasonable suspicion existed for stopping Taylor.Â  Specifically, we\r\n  find Bellamy failed to articulate facts leading to the conclusion that an\r\n  objective manifestation of criminal activity existed under the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Any inference of illegal activity drawn from Taylor's close\r\n  proximity to his companion was dispelled by Bellamy's failure to observe\r\n  anything pass between the two men or Taylor act in a way to indicate criminal\r\n  activity.Â  Additionally, the anonymous tip was substantially unreliable.Â  Further,\r\n  the high-crime nature of the area and the time of day are not in and of\r\n  themselves indicative of criminal activity.Â  Lastly, Taylor's attempted\r\n  departure from his companion, by riding his bicycle toward the officers, was\r\n  not attempted flight or evasive behavior because he had the right to ignore\r\n  Bellamy's commands and go about his business.[22]Â \r\n  Thus, we find Taylor's actions required either no police response or further\r\n  investigation confirming Bellamy's curiosities before a forcible stop was\r\n  authorized.Â  Therefore, the admission of the drug evidence was clear error, and\r\n  we reverse Taylor's conviction and vacate his sentence.[23]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would hold that under our\r\n  standard of review, the evidence presented during the suppression hearing\r\n  warrants affirming the trial judge's findings that the police had reasonable\r\n  suspicion to approach and detain Taylor as well as the right to take\r\n  precautions for their own safety when he refused to cooperate.Â  I would also\r\n  affirm the trial judge's rejection of Taylor's arguments for suppressing the\r\n  drugs found on his person when the police attempted to search him for weapons.\r\nIn State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000), the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court set forth the standard of review for rulings in\r\n  Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases:Â  the appellate court &quot;will\r\n  review the trial court's ruling like any other factual finding and reverse if\r\n  there is clear error. . . . [The appellate court] will affirm if there is any\r\n  evidence to support the ruling.&quot;Â  In holding reasonable suspicion was\r\n  lacking, the majority appears to have departed from this standard in favor of\r\n  relying on its own view of the totality of the circumstances in the case.Â  \r\nI\r\n  agree a determination of reasonable suspicion requires consideration of\r\n  &quot;the totality of the circumstancesâ€”the whole picture.&quot;Â  U.S. v.\r\n    Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981).Â  In this State, however, this analysis of\r\n  the totality of the circumstances is a function of the trial court and does not\r\n  alter the deferential standard that appellate courts must observe when\r\n  reviewing a trial judge's finding as to whether a Fourth Amendment violation\r\n  has occurred.Â  See State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 69-70,\r\n  572 S.E.2d 456, 459-60 (2002) (adhering to the deferential standard of review,\r\n  but stating that Brockman &quot;does not hold the appellate court may\r\n  not conduct its own review of the record to determine whether the trial judge's\r\n  decision is supported by the evidence&quot;).\r\nUsing\r\n  the deferential standard of review mandated by our Supreme Court, I would hold\r\n  the State presented evidence during the suppression hearing to support the trial\r\n  judge's finding that Officer Bellamy's decision to approach and detain Taylor\r\n  was based on &quot;specific and articulable facts, which, taken together with\r\n  rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant[ed] [the]\r\n  intrusion.&quot;Â  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968), quoted in State v. Lesley, 326 S.C. 641, 643-44, 486 S.E.2d 276, 277 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997).\r\nAs\r\n  the trial judge stated when denying Taylor's motion to suppress, this case\r\n  involved more than an anonymous tip.Â  There was testimony from the police officers\r\n  that the location named by the tipster was a well-known drug area.Â \r\n  Furthermore, although Taylor pedaled toward the officers when he separated from\r\n  his companion, it appears undisputed that he was attempting to avoid them.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, the trial judge placed great emphasis on Officer Bellamy's testimony\r\n  that he observed Taylor and his companion &quot;huddled up trying to hide\r\n  something&quot; and that, in Bellamy's experience, &quot;[i]t's 90 percent of\r\n  the time it's some sort of illegal activity going on.&quot;Â  Although the\r\n  majority acknowledged in its recitation of the facts that Officer Bellamy\r\n  relied on his law enforcement experience in deciding the situation warranted\r\n  detaining Taylor, it appears to dismiss his reliance on this experience and\r\n  instead emphasize the fact that none of the officers at the scene saw anything\r\n  pass between the two men while they were observed &quot;huddled up.&quot;Â  What\r\n  the majority appears to overlook is that the meeting between Taylor and his\r\n  companion happened late in the evening and apparently at some distance from\r\n  where the officers first sighted them.Â  This is unlike the encounter in U.S.\r\n    v. Sprinkle, 106 F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1997), on which the majority\r\n  relies.Â  See id. at 616 (noting the arresting officers had\r\n  &quot;walked by the driver side&quot; of the vehicle in which the defendant was\r\n  &quot;huddling and talking to&quot; another individual and quoting testimony\r\n  from the officers that their observations of the defendant before arresting him\r\n  took place on a &quot; 'fairly bright day' with 'plenty of light' &quot;).Â  Thus,\r\n  whereas in Sprinkle the officers actually saw at close range and in\r\n  bright light the absence of fruits or instruments of any crime, the officers in\r\n  the present case could have been prevented by distance and lighting conditions\r\n  from observing any suspicious activity, particularly if the subjects engaged in\r\n  that activity were attempting to conceal it. Â Considering that the officers had\r\n  less than optimal conditions to view the scene, I can fault neither Officer\r\n  Bellamy for his decision to rely on his professional experience and training in\r\n  determining that what he saw warranted further investigation nor the trial\r\n  judge for ruling that this reliance was reasonable.Â  Courts have allowed such\r\n  reliance when reviewing probable cause determinations.Â  See State v.\r\n    Peters, 271 S.C. 498, 504, 248 S.E.2d 475, 478 (1978) (&quot;In dealing with probable cause, . . . as the very name\r\n  implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the\r\n  factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and\r\n  prudent men, not legal technicians, act.&quot;); State v. Davis, 354\r\n  S.C. 348, 357, 580 S.E.2d 778, 783 (Ct. App. 2003) (&quot;[T]he law is well\r\n  settled that the officer's knowledge of general trends in criminal behavior is\r\n  a relevant consideration in determining probable cause.&quot;).Â  I see no\r\n  reason not to apply a similar policy when reviewing determinations of\r\n  reasonable suspicion, which require &quot; 'less than the level of suspicion\r\n  required for probable cause.' &quot;Â  State Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 202,\r\n  539 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Nebraska v. Soukharith, 570\r\n  N.W.2d 344, 354 (Neb. 1997)).\r\nI\r\n  would therefore follow the reasoning set forth by the Fourth Circuit Court of\r\n  Appeals in U.S. v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151 (4th Cir. 1993),\r\n  which the majority has referenced but attempted to distinguish.Â  In that case,\r\n  the court, in rejecting the defendant's argument that he was unlawfully stopped\r\n  by the police after officers observed him extending his hand with his palm up\r\n  while talking with friends on a street corner in a poor section of town, stated\r\n  that &quot;[w]hile the defendant's mere presence in a high crime area is not by\r\n  itself enough to raise reasonable suspicion, an area's propensity toward\r\n  criminal activity is something that an officer may consider.&quot;Â  Id. at 154.Â  The court also noted &quot;[t]he lateness of the hour is another fact\r\n  that may raise the level of suspicion.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Finally,\r\n  notwithstanding the absence of evidence of drugs or other contraband at the\r\n  scene, the court justified the officers' decision to approach the defendant,\r\n  explaining as follows:\r\n\r\n  Additionally,\r\n    the officers observed the defendant engaged in behavior that they suspected to\r\n    be a drug transaction. Â In this neighborhood at this late time of night, a\r\n    group of men was gathered around Lender looking down into his open palm. Â We\r\n    cannot say that a reasonable police officer was required to regard such conduct\r\n    as innocuous.Â  Even though the officers acknowledged that from their passing\r\n      patrol car they could not see drugs or other contraband in the defendant's\r\n      hand, the officers were not required in the absence of probable cause simply to\r\n      â€œshrug [their] shoulders and allow a crime to occur.â€Â  Because they suspected\r\n      illegal activity, Officers Hill and Thornell responded precisely as the law\r\n      provides:Â  they attempted to investigate further.\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  I would hold that there was evidence presented during the suppression hearing\r\n  to support a finding of reasonable suspicion, I would also reject Taylor's\r\n  argument that the drugs discovered by the police after they stopped him should\r\n  have been excluded as the fruits of an illegal stop. \r\nAs\r\n  to Taylor's other argument, that the officers did not have the legal right to\r\n  intrude into the tennis ball because there was nothing inherently incriminating\r\n  about it, I would hold the testimony presented during the suppression hearing\r\n  supports the trial judge's finding that Officer Bellamy acted reasonably when\r\n  he discovered it on Taylor's person.Â  During the pat-down search, Officer\r\n  Bellamy could determine only that the bulge in Taylor's pocket was a &quot;hard\r\n  object&quot; that warranted further investigation to ascertain that it was not\r\n  a weapon.Â  When Officer Bellamy asked Taylor what was in his pocket, Taylor\r\n  attempted to extricate himself, and Officer Bellamy managed to manipulate the\r\n  object out of Taylor's pocket and onto the ground.Â  According to Officer\r\n  Bellamy, he noticed the drugs inside the tennis ball through the slit on the\r\n  surface on the ball as he was picking it up from the ground.Â  Thus, the\r\n  incriminating nature of the contents of the tennis ball became apparent to the\r\n  police while they were still in the process of ensuring Taylor was not armed.Â  See State v. Abrams, 322 S.C. 286, 288, 471 S.E.2d 716, 717 (Ct. App. 1996)\r\n  (holding that once the police discovered the defendant was not armed,\r\n  &quot;they could not carry the intrusiveness of their search further unless the\r\n  incriminating character of the object discovered during the search was\r\n  immediately apparent to the officer performing the pat-down&quot;).Â  Nothing in Officer Bellamy's testimony suggested that he squeezed\r\n  the ball for any purpose other than to pick it up off the ground.Â  Moreover, it\r\n  was as he was picking up the ball that he noticed the drugs inside it through\r\n  the slit on the surface.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the trial judge's denial\r\n  of Taylor's motion to suppress the drug evidence offered by the State against\r\n  him and would likewise affirm his conviction. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Bellamy articulated Taylor was &quot;standing with\r\n  his bicycle straddled between his legs kind of in a huddle with the other\r\n  subject [who] was standing beside him very close.&quot;Â  While Bellamy was\r\n  &quot;unable to tell due to the lighting . . . if anything was passed off&quot;\r\n  between the men, he nevertheless decided to approach Taylor in light of the\r\n  illegal activities in the area.\r\n[3] The trial court acknowledged Taylor correctly\r\n  interpreted J.L. and Green, but explained J.L. and Green &quot;stand for the premise that . . . reasonable suspicion based solely on an\r\n  anonymous tip lacks sufficient [indicia of] reliability.&quot;Â  The court\r\n  believed &quot;if the testimony was that they had an anonymous tip, they went\r\n  to the area, they found a person fitting that description on a bicycle[, t]hey\r\n  walked up to him and they frisked him,&quot; then J.L. and Green would preclude the admission of the drug evidence.Â  Nevertheless, the trial\r\n  court differentiated the facts at hand from J.L. and Green,\r\n  finding it was &quot;not just solely [an] anonymous tip.&quot;\r\n[4] Taylor also claimed the officers lacked probable\r\n  cause to continue searching him after finding the tennis ball; therefore, the\r\n  drug evidence should be suppressed as fruit of an unlawful search and seizure.Â \r\n  Bellamy testified in camera that after feeling a large item in\r\n  Taylor's pocket, he searched his pocket to identify whether the object was a\r\n  weapon.Â  Bellamy pushed the object out of Taylor's pocket, and the tennis ball\r\n  rolled on the ground.Â  Bellamy picked the tennis ball up, squeezed it, noticed\r\n  a slit, and observed what he believed to be a bag of crack cocaine inside the\r\n  tennis ball.Â  Consequently, the trial court also denied Taylor's suppression\r\n  motion with regard to this argument, finding Bellamy had &quot;the right to\r\n  satisfy himself that [the] hard object was not a weapon.&quot;\r\n[5] Taylor was tried in his absence, and his sentence was\r\n  initially sealed.\r\n[6] Cf.

App. 2008) (finding a defendant's refusal to heed officers'\r\n  requests to stop failed to serve as justification for his seizure because\r\n  &quot;citizens who are not under arrest or otherwise detained have every right\r\n  to refuse or ignore requests from law enforcement officers&quot;).\r\n[10] At approximately 2:15 a.m., the informant alleged\r\n  &quot;an individual seated in a nearby vehicle was carrying narcotics and had a\r\n  gun at his waist.&quot;Â  Adams, 407 U.S. at 144-45.\r\n[11] The suspect was located in an area known for criminal\r\n  activity.Â  Id. at 147.\r\n[12] When the officer reached the vehicle to investigate\r\n  the tip, he tapped on the window and asked the occupant, Robert Williams, to\r\n  open the door.Â  Id. at 145.Â  &quot;When Williams rolled down the window\r\n  instead, [the officer] reached into the car and removed a fully loaded revolver\r\n  from Williams'[s] waistband.Â  The gun had not been visible . . . from outside\r\n  the car, but it was in precisely the place&quot; the informant indicated.Â  Id.Â  \r\n[13] No information about the informant or audio recording\r\n  of the call existed.Â  J.L., 529 U.S. at 268.\r\n[14] The court rejected a firearm exception to the\r\n  standard Terry analysis:Â  &quot;If police officers may properly conduct Terry frisks on the basis of bare-boned tips about guns, it would be reasonable to\r\n  maintain . . . that the police should similarly have discretion to frisk based\r\n  on bare-boned tips about narcotics.Â  As we clarified when we made indicia of\r\n  reliability critical in Adams and White, the Fourth Amendment is\r\n  not so easily satisfied.&quot;Â  J.L. at 273.\r\n[15] The government also argued if Sprinkle's initial stop\r\n  was illegal, his intervening illegal acts made his handgun admissible\r\n  evidence.Â  Sprinkle, 106 F.3d at 619.Â  As Riccio pursued Sprinkle,\r\n  Sprinkle discharged a handgun in Riccio's direction.Â  Id.Â  The Fourth\r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the government, determining Sprinkle's\r\n  illegal acts after the initial stop triggered an exception to the exclusionary\r\n  rule because he &quot;committed a new crime that was distinct from any crime he\r\n  might have been suspected of at the time of the initial stop.&quot;Â  Id. at 619.Â  The court cited additional examples of intervening acts triggering the\r\n  exception, including assaulting an officer and attempting to retrieve the\r\n  officer's gun, aiming a weapon at an officer, shooting at an officer, and\r\n  fleeing at 115 miles per hour in a vehicle while shooting at police.Â  Id. at 619 n.4.\r\n[16] The Dissent also references the lateness of hour as a\r\n  circumstance establishing reasonable suspicion.Â  However, Bellamy did not\r\n  testify he considered the time of day to contribute to his decision to stop\r\n  Taylor, nor did the State argue the time of day was a contributing factor to\r\n  the trial court when opposing Taylor's motion to suppress.\r\n[17] For example, in Green v. State, 551 A.2d 127,\r\n  130 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1989), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals found the\r\n  verification of the description of an individual's clothing and location\r\n  accused of criminal activity &quot;failed to serve as sufficient corroboration\r\n  to establish reliability.&quot;\r\n[18] See U.S. v. Perrin, 45 F.3d 869, 873\r\n  (4th Cir. 1995) (&quot;Were we to treat the dangerousness of the neighborhood\r\n  as an independent corroborating factor, we would be, in effect, holding a\r\n  suspect accountable for factors wholly outside of his control.&quot;).\r\n[19] Our neighboring state of Georgia addressed a similar\r\n  issue in Swanson v. State, 412 S.E.2d 630 (Ga. Ct. App. 1991).Â  In Swanson,\r\n  an officer stopped an individual after receiving an anonymous tip alleging an\r\n  individual was selling drugs.Â  Id. at 631.Â  The tip included a detailed\r\n  description of the individual's clothing and his exact address.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Relying on White, the Georgia Court of Appeals determined even though\r\n  the officer knew the address was located within a high drug trafficking area,\r\n  &quot;further observation and corroboration was required before a forcible stop\r\n  was authorized.&quot;Â  Id. at 632.Â  Specifically, the court stated: \r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    anonymous tip contained no detailed information demonstrating the caller's\r\n    ability to predict [the individual's] future behavior, and thus contained no\r\n    information from which the police could have reason to believe the tipster was\r\n    not only honest but also well informed enough to justify the stop . . . [and\r\n    the officer's] knowledge that the address was in a high drug trafficking area\r\n    [failed to corroborate] the anonymous tipster's information so as to impart a\r\n    degree of reliability to the other allegations made by the caller.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n[20]Â  While the Dissent notes the trial court emphasized\r\n  Bellamy's curiosity that Taylor was engaged in criminal activity based on his\r\n  closeness with his companion, no evidence existed to confirm Bellamy's\r\n  curiosity or suggest the men were positioned close together to conceal criminal activity.&nbsp; Bellamy's belief that two males engaged in a close\r\n  &quot;huddle&quot; conversation are conducting illegal activity ninety percent\r\n  of the time was not evidence that Taylor was engaged in criminal\r\n  activity.&nbsp; Respectful of Bellamy's experience as a police officer and\r\n  inferences drawn therefrom, he was still required to point to specific and\r\n  articulable facts that, when considered in conjunction with those experiences\r\n  and inferences, would reasonably warrant stopping Taylor.&nbsp; Furthermore,\r\n  while the Dissent contends the time of day and proximity of the officers caused\r\n  difficulty in observing any potential suspicious activity, especially if Taylor\r\n  and his companion were attempting to conceal it, the fact remains that the\r\n  officers failed to observe any activity suggesting illegality was afoot.\r\n[21] See State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 219\r\n  n.3, 532 S.E.2d 896, 898 n.3 (Ct. App. 2000) (providing an &quot;any\r\n  evidence&quot; standard of review for search and seizure cases).\r\n[22] See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119,\r\n  125 (2000) (holding when an officer lacks reasonable suspicion or probable\r\n  cause, if he approaches an individual, &quot;the individual has a right to\r\n  ignore the police and go about his business&quot;).\r\n[23] Due to the officers' lack of reasonable suspicion to\r\n  warrant an investigatory stop, we decline to address Taylor's remaining issue\r\n  on appeal regarding whether the officers had probable cause to search his\r\n  tennis ball.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding when one issue is\r\n  dispositive, the remaining issues need not be addressed).Â  In any event,\r\n  because Bellamy lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Taylor, any evidence\r\n  acquired as a direct result of the illegal stop is inadmissible pursuant to the\r\n  fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.Â  See In re Jeremiah W., 361\r\n  S.C. 620, 624 n.2, 606 S.E.2d 766, 768 n.2 (2004) (&quot;The 'fruit of the\r\n  poisonous tree' doctrine holds that evidence which is produced by or directly\r\n  derived from an illegal search is generally inadmissible against the defendant\r\n  because of its original taint.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4688","title":"State v.

Barfield, of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Charles Carmack (Carmack) was indicted and tried on four counts of\r\n  assault and battery with intent to kill Â and one charge of possession of a\r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime. Â A jury found him\r\n  guilty on four counts of the lesser included offense of assault and battery of\r\n  a high an aggravated nature (ABHAN) and acquitted him on the firearm charge. Â On\r\n  appeal, Carmack argues the trial court erred: (1) in failing to sequester all\r\n  the witnesses; (2) in failing to remove the jury foreperson; (3) in admitting\r\n  Carmack's allegedly involuntary statement; (4) in admitting extrinsic evidence\r\n  of prior statements made by a witness; and (5) in excluding a school-related\r\n  document.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 28, 2006,\r\n  John Wood hosted fifty to seventy people for a party he dubbed &quot;Farm\r\n  Fest&quot; on property he owned in Fairfield County.Â  Although a bandstand was\r\n  erected outdoors, rainy conditions forced many of the party-goers to celebrate\r\n  in an adjacent barn.Â  While in the barn, Carmack and Scott Fowler engaged in a\r\n  brief altercation, after which Carmack left the barn and headed toward his\r\n  pick-up truck parked nearby.Â  \r\nCarmack's\r\n  brother, Chris Carmack (Brother), testified that as Carmack approached his\r\n  truck he was attacked by a group of men.Â  Daniel Holt testified that after this\r\n  second altercation Carmack retrieved a rifle from his truck and fired one shot in\r\n  the air and then approached the barn.Â  Brother followed Carmack and attempted to\r\n  cool the situation;[1] however, another shot was fired which penetrated the barn wall and injured\r\n  three people inside and paralyzed a fourth from the waist down.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the early morning hours following the party, then seventeen-year-old Carmack surrendered\r\n  to police, was arrested, and placed in an interview room at the Fairfield\r\n  County Sheriff's Office.Â  Deputy Sheriff Boney read Carmack his rights, and he initialed\r\n  a waiver of rights form around 2:00 or 2:30 a.m. Â Carmack did not initial next\r\n  to the right to remain silent; however, Deputy Boney testified he read Carmack\r\n  this right and Carmack indicated he understood it.Â  Furthermore, although Carmack\r\n  said he had been drinking, Deputy Boney noticed no signs he was intoxicated as he\r\n  was not slurring his speech and was steady on his feet.Â  Deputy Boney then\r\n  recorded Carmack's statement by hand, which Carmack subsequently read and\r\n  signed. Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Carmack moved to have the State's thirty-four witnesses sequestered;\r\n  however, the trial court sequestered only the witnesses who had not previously given\r\n  written statements.Â  One of the unsequestered witnesses was Brother, who\r\n  offered testimony providing more detail and an account of the evening that\r\n  differed slightly from his prior written statement. Â When questioned by\r\n  the State, Brother maintained the prior statement was accurate, but admitted\r\n  some details were left out. Â The State then successfully admitted the\r\n  prior written statement into evidence over Carmack's objection. \r\nDuring the\r\n  trial, Carmack's counsel learned the jury foreperson, Watts, had allegedly\r\n  discussed the case with his live-in girlfriend, Mary, who had in turn allegedly\r\n  discussed the case with a colleague, Nona Money.Â  The trial court met with the\r\n  jury foreperson twice and was convinced that no juror misconduct had occurred.Â \r\n  Money testified in camera that when she inquired whether Mary and Watts would\r\n  still be taking a vacation, Mary responded: &quot;Yeah.Â  It's cut and dry case.\r\n  [sic] Everyone knows that he did it.&quot;Â  The trial court again decided not to\r\n  excuse Watts.\r\nCarmack called\r\n  Cindy Burley as his sole defense witness and sought to introduce a documented\r\n  &quot;service plan&quot; or &quot;Individual Educational Plan&quot; (IEP) as of\r\n  evidence an alleged learning disability.Â  The State objected, and the trial court\r\n  ruled the evidence to be inadmissible hearsay because it contained subjective\r\n  information.Â  Carmack immediately rested his case. \r\nThe jury convicted Carmack on four counts of the lesser included offense of ABHAN, and the trial\r\n  court sentenced Carmack to twenty-five years.[2]Â \r\n  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to sequester all \r\n\t\t\tof the State's fact witnesses?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to remove the \r\n\t\t\tjury foreperson?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in admitting Carmack's statement?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in admitting extrinsic \r\n\t\t\tevidence of Brother's statement to police?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to allow the IEP into evidence?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Sequestering Witnesses\r\nCarmack\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to sequester all the State's fact\r\n  witnesses.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  Rule 615, SCRE allows for sequestration of a\r\n  witness, &quot;[t]he granting or refusal of a motion to sequester witnesses is\r\n  solely discretionary.&quot;Â  State v. Jackson, 265 S.C. 278, 281, 217\r\n  S.E.2d 794, 795 (1975).Â  The trial court's ruling on a motion to sequester a\r\n  witness will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion and\r\n  prejudice to an appellant. Â State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 46, 282\r\n  S.E.2d 838, 844 (1981); see Jackson, 265 S.C. at 282, 217 S.E.2d at\r\n  796 (finding no error when trial court's ruling demonstrated no abuse of\r\n  discretion or prejudice to appellant).Â  &quot;The mere opportunity for the\r\n  State's witnesses to compare testimony is insufficient to compel\r\n  sequestration.&quot; Â Sullivan, 277 S.C. at 46, 282 S.E.2d at 844.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the trial court ruled that only witnesses who had not previously given written\r\n  statements needed to be sequestered.Â  While this ruling allowed many of the\r\n  State's witnesses to remain in the courtroom, the threat that exposure to other\r\n  testimony would taint subsequent testimony was alleviated by affording Carmack\r\n  the opportunity to impeach any witnesses who altered their accounts by way of\r\n  their previous written statements.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion and Carmack was not prejudiced by this ruling.Â  See Jackson,\r\n  265 S.C. 278, 217 S.E.2d 794 (affirming a trial court's denial of a motion to\r\n  sequester witnesses when the witnesses had testified at a previous trial and\r\n  could easily be impeached with their prior testimony).Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Removal of Foreperson\r\nCarmack\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to remove the jury foreperson, Watts.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  decision to dismiss a juror and replace him with an alternate rests in the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse\r\n  of discretion.Â  State v. Smith, 338 S.C. 66, 71, 525 S.E.2d 263, 265-66\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Premature deliberations may amount to misconduct that could affect\r\n  fundamental fairness.Â  State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 311, 509 S.E.2d\r\n  811, 813 (1999).Â  &quot;The trial court has broad discretion in assessing\r\n  allegations of juror misconduct&quot; and unless such misconduct affects the\r\n  &quot;jury's impartiality, it is not [of the type] as will affect the\r\n  verdict.&quot; Â State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 141, 502 S.E.2d 99, 105\r\n  (1998).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Carmack's counsel learned Watts may have discussed the case with his\r\n  live-in girlfriend, Mary, who subsequently may have mentioned the discussion to\r\n  her boss, Nona Money.Â  As a result, the trial court met with Watts on two\r\n  occasions.Â  During these meetings, Watts was under oath and informed the court\r\n  he had neither discussed the matter with his girlfriend nor engaged in any\r\n  activity that would affect his impartiality.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court was in the best position to assess Watts's veracity and its\r\n  refusal to dismiss Watts is deserving of this court's deference. Â See id. at 142, 502 S.E.2d at 104 (stating &quot;the trial judge is in the best\r\n  position to determine the credibility of the jurors; therefore, this [c]ourt\r\n  should grant him broad deference&quot;).Â  Furthermore, as the State indicates,\r\n  other than Carmack's allegations, no evidence exists on the record to support\r\n  that Watts discussed the matter with Mary.Â  Rather, the record merely reflects\r\n  Money testified that Mary stated, &quot;It's cut and dry case. [sic]Â \r\n  Everyone knows he did it.&quot;Â  Nothing suggests Watts made any statements to\r\n  Mary.Â  Accordingly, as Carmack presents no other allegation of prejudice, the\r\n  ruling of the trial court is affirmed.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Carmack's Statement\r\nCarmack\r\n  argues the trial court erred in admitting his statement to the jury because it\r\n  was involuntary.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  process for determining whether a statement is voluntarily made is two-fold;\r\n  requiring a determination by both the trial court and the jury.Â  State v.\r\n    Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 379, 652 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In order\r\n  for the issue to be submitted to the jury, the State must prove to the trial\r\n  court, by preponderance of the evidence, that the statement was freely and\r\n  voluntarily given.Â  Id.Â Â  On appeal, this court reviews the trial court to\r\n  &quot;simply determine[] whether the . . . ruling is supported by any evidence.&quot; Â Id. (emphasis added). \r\nIn\r\n  order to determine whether a statement is voluntary, the trial court must\r\n  inquire whether under the totality of the circumstances the suspect's will was\r\n  overborne.Â  Id. at 384, 652 S.E.2d at 451.Â  Some factors to consider in\r\n  the totality of the circumstances include &quot;the youth of the accused, his\r\n  lack of education, or . . . low intelligence, the lack ofÂ  . . . advice to the\r\n  accused of his constitutional rights, the length of detention, the repeated and\r\n  prolonged nature of the questioning, and . . .Â  physical punishment such as the\r\n  deprivation of food or sleep.&quot;Â  Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S.\r\n  218, 226 (1973) (internal citations omitted); see Miller, 375\r\n  S.C. at 385-86, 652 S.E.2d at 452 (stating the totality of the circumstances\r\n  includes the crucial elements of police coercion: length of the interrogation,\r\n  location, continuity, defendant's maturity, defendant's education, physical\r\n  conditions, and the defendant's mental health).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Carmack points to his age, his ninth-grade education, the fact that\r\n  it was late in the evening and he had earlier been drinking, and the lack of\r\n  his initials next to the right to remain silent on the waiver of rights form.Â \r\n  However, evidence also exists to demonstrate that Officer Boney had fully\r\n  advised Carmack of his rights and Carmack indicated he understood them.Â \r\n  Although Carmack had been drinking earlier that night, Officer Boney noticed\r\n  nothing to suggest he was intoxicated.Â  Further, although Carmack's initials\r\n  are lacking next to the line informing him of his right to remain silent, he\r\n  demonstrated his ability to read and signed all other areas of the waiver of\r\n  rights form.Â  Accordingly, based on our standard of review, evidence exists to\r\n  support the trial court's ruling that the statement was voluntary. Â See Miller,\r\n  375 S.C. at 378, 652 S.E.2d at 448 (stating this court will affirm the trial\r\n  court's ruling on the voluntariness of a statement if supported by any\r\n  evidence). Â Thus, the issue was properly submitted to the jury, and the ruling\r\n  of the trial court is affirmed.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Extrinsic Evidence of Brother's\r\n  Statement\r\nCarmack\r\n  argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce Brother's prior\r\n  written statement into evidence because, he alleges, Brother admitted he made a\r\n  prior inconsistent statement, rendering it inadmissible under Rule 613(b),\r\n  SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, in order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review,\r\n  it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  State v.\r\n    Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003).Â  Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  Knight v. Waggoner, 359 S.C. 492, 496, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State takes the position that Carmack's argument under Rule 613, is not\r\n  preserved.Â  Specifically, the State maintains Carmack's only argument at trial\r\n  was that the statement was inadmissible under Rule 801(d)(1).Â  However, the\r\n  record demonstrates Carmack's objection specifically recognized that the\r\n  solicitor could cross-examine the content of the statement, but the statement\r\n  itself was not admissible.Â  Although Carmack did make reference to Rule 801(d)\r\n  he clarified his objection by stating; &quot;If he wants to read the statement\r\n  . . . into the record, . . . that's certainly appropriate.Â  The document itself\r\n  [is] what we have an objection to.&quot;Â  While Carmack never explicitly mentioned\r\n  Rule 613 by name, the record demonstrates Carmack's argument against the\r\n  admissibility of the written statement itself was sufficiently raised to the\r\n  trial court.Â  See State v. Caldwell, 378 S.C. 268, 283, 662\r\n  S.E.2d 474, 482 (Ct. App. 2008) (noting a &quot;party need not use the exact\r\n  name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve it, but it must be clear that the\r\n  argument has been presented on that ground&quot; (quoting Dunbar, 356 S.C.\r\n  at 142, 587 S.E.2d at 694)).Â  Accordingly, we address the merits of the\r\n  argument.\r\nA\r\n  decision to admit extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement will not\r\n  be reversed absent a manifest abuse of discretion that prejudiced the appellant.Â  State v. Blalock, 357 S.C. 74, 78, 591 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nOn\r\n  reply, the State argues the trial court did not err because the statement is admissible\r\n  under Rule 801(d).Â  However, the record indicates Carmack agreed the statement\r\n  could be read into the record; accordingly, this is tantamount to conceding the\r\n  statement was not hearsay pursuant to Rule 801(d). Â This concession leaves the\r\n  only remaining inquiry to be whether the written statement itself is\r\n  admissible.Â  \r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  613 (b) provides: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tExtrinsic\r\n  evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible\r\n  unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and\r\n  place is was allegedy made, and the person to whom it was made . . . .Â Â  If a\r\n  witness does not admit [making] . . . the prior inconsistent statement,\r\n  extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n  the issue is whether the witness admitted making the prior inconsistent\r\n  statement, the admission must be unequivocal.Â  Blalock, 357 S.C. at 80,\r\n  591 S.E.2d at 635.Â  &quot;Generally, where the witness has responded with\r\n  anything less than an unequivocal admission, trial court's have been granted\r\n  wide latitude to allow extrinsic evidence proving the statement.&quot; Id. at 80, 591 S.E.2d at 636.Â  Here, Brother testified his prior statement was\r\n  &quot;accurate.&quot;Â  Further he indicated that certain details were not in\r\n  his original statement because such details were not inquired into at the time\r\n  and &quot;everything was chaotic.&quot;Â  Accordingly, Brother did not\r\n  unequivocally admit making a prior inconsistent statement; therefore, the trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in allowing extrinsic evidence of the\r\n  statement. See id. (finding a witness had not unequivocally\r\n  admitted the prior inconsistent statement simply by virtue of recognizing some\r\n  details were lacking in the prior statement).Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; The School-Related Document\r\nFinally Carmack\r\n  argues the trial court erred in not admitting the IEP into evidence.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion,&quot; which occurs when the\r\n  conclusions of the trial court lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an\r\n  error of law.Â  State v. Rivera, 384 S.C. 356, 360, 682 S.E.2d 307, 309\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;An error without prejudice does not warrant\r\n  reversal.&quot;Â  State v. King, 367 S.C. 131, 136, 623 S.E.2d 865, 867\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Rule 803(6), SCRE excepts from the prohibition against\r\n  hearsay, records of regularly conducted activity, and provides:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events,\r\n  conditions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information\r\n  transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly\r\n  conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that\r\n  business activity to make [the same] . . . ; provided however, that\r\n  subjective opinions and judgments found in business records are not\r\n  admissible.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court found the document to be inadmissible hearsay, under Rule 803(6) because\r\n  the document contained subjective opinions.Â  Carmack maintains the document\r\n  should have been admitted as it contained information of &quot;acts, events,\r\n  conditions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time&quot; the document was\r\n  prepared.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Carmack sought to introduce the IEP in an effort to demonstrate an\r\n  alleged learning disability in the hopes of providing the jury with evidence\r\n  that his statement was not voluntary.Â  The IEP was prepared at a meeting\r\n  attended by three teachers from Carmack's school familiar with his scholastic\r\n  performance.Â  While the trial court ruled the actual report to be inadmissible,\r\n  the court never precluded Carmack from introducing testimonial evidence through\r\n  any of the school representatives familiar with Carmack's work performance.Â  Thus,\r\n  Carmack's contention that he was precluded from putting on a full defense as a\r\n  result of the document being excluded is unfounded.Â  Accordingly, we find no\r\n  reversible error.Â  See King, 367 S.C. at 136, 623 S.E.2d at 867\r\n  (stating the trial court's ruling will not be reversed unless it amounted to\r\n  prejudicial error). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  mentioned reasons the ruling of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  It is unclear as to how Brother attempted to cool\r\n  the situation; whether he grabbed Carmack, or grabbed the gun.Â  Brother's\r\n  testimony is less than clear as to what extent he was engaging Carmack (i.e.,\r\n  whether Brother's hands were on the gun and Carmack, or just Carmack).\r\n[2]&nbsp; This sentence consisted of ten years on the first ABHAN conviction, ten years consecutive on the second ABHAN conviction, five\r\n  years consecutive on the third ABHAN, and finally, five years concurrent on the\r\n  final ABHAN conviction. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4689","title":"Bodkin v.

Â Husband\r\n  filed an answer and counterclaim requesting a divorce on the ground of Wife's habitual\r\n  intoxication.Â  Prior to the commencement of trial, Wife amended her complaint\r\n  to request a divorce on the ground of one year's continuous separation.Â  The\r\n  parties also agreed Wife would have custody of Daughter and Husband would have\r\n  visitation.\r\nPrior to trial,\r\n  Wife filed a Petition for Citation for Contempt alleging Husband used money\r\n  from a money market account to purchase property in Georgetown County\r\n  (Georgetown Property) while an order was in effect prohibiting the parties\r\n  &quot;from injuring, damaging, destroying, selling, alienating, exchanging,\r\n  trading, encumbering, collaterizing, or otherwise liquidating or decreasing in\r\n  value any personal or real property, until a final order on the merits is\r\n  issued.&quot;Â  The family court found Husband had &quot;dissipated an\r\n  asset,&quot; held him in contempt, and ordered him to pay $500 in court costs,\r\n  $1,500 to Wife as a fine, and $585 in attorney's fees to Wife's attorney.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a trial, the family court found Husband's &quot;evidence did not meet the level\r\n  of proof necessary to establish habitual drunkenness&quot; and he was not entitled\r\n  to a divorce on that ground.Â  The family court granted Wife a divorce based on\r\n  one year's continuous separation.Â  The family court determined the marital\r\n  estate should be distributed fifty percent to Wife and fifty percent to\r\n  Husband.Â  It found the marital home was a marital asset and awarded it to\r\n  Wife.Â  However, it determined Husband had contributed the entire down payment\r\n  of $81,707 with premarital funds and awarded him a credit in that amount.Â  The\r\n  family court awarded Wife permanent, periodic alimony of $1,500 per month.Â \r\n  Additionally, the family court awarded Wife $15,000 in attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Wife filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration, and\r\n  Husband filed a Rule 60, SCRCP, motion for a new trial.Â  The family court\r\n  denied both motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;On appeal from a family court order, this [c]ourt has\r\n  authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307\r\n  S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  &quot;Because the family court is\r\n  in a superior position to judge the witnesses' demeanor and veracity, its\r\n  findings should be given broad discretion.&quot;Â  Scott v. Scott, 354\r\n  S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  When the evidence is disputed, the\r\n  appellate court may adhere to the family court's findings. Â Woodall v.\r\n    Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; HUSBAND'S\r\n  APPEAL\r\nA.&nbsp; Habitual\r\n  Drunkenness\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to grant him a divorce on the grounds\r\n  of Wife's habitual drunkenness.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  divorce may be granted on the ground of habitual drunkenness, including\r\n  drunkenness caused by the use of any narcotic drug.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-10(4) (1985).Â  &quot;In order to prove habitual drunkenness, there must be a showing\r\n  that the abuse of alcohol caused the breakdown of the marriage and that such\r\n  abuse existed at or near the time of filing for divorce.&quot;Â  Epperly v. Epperly,\r\n  312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885&nbsp;(1994).Â  In Epperly, &quot;Wife and her\r\n  witnesses testified that Husband drank heavily on a daily basis. Â However,\r\n  Husband and his witnesses testified that he seldom drank and never to excess.&quot;\r\n  Â Id.Â  The supreme court adopted the findings of the family court as it\r\n  was in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses because the\r\n  testimony on this issue was so divergent. Â Id., 440 S.E.2d at 885-86.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Wife testified she was a social drinker and she and Husband\r\n  drank socially together during the marriage.Â  She acknowledged that on one\r\n  occasion she had too much to drink before Stepdaughter's sorority party and\r\n  embarrassed Stepdaughter with her behavior.Â  She indicated Husband had never\r\n  really suggested to her she needed treatment for a problem with alcohol, but he\r\n  had complained about a lot of things, including drinking.\r\nWife\r\n  also testified she had developed a lot of health problems since Daughter's\r\n  birth, and she took several prescription medications for conditions including hypertension,\r\n  depression, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, and skin problems.Â  She\r\n  testified she had several cancers removed the year of the trial.\r\nStepson testified\r\n  that growing up there was always drinking in the house, but that neither\r\n  Husband nor Wife's behavior concerned him.Â  He testified Husband and Wife drank\r\n  about the same amount, a few beers.Â  He testified that when he went away to\r\n  college and returned to visit, Wife had a tendency to get drunk at home and\r\n  also drank excessively when they were out in public.Â  Stepson acknowledged that\r\n  around the time when Husband and Wife separated, he had not spent much time at\r\n  the marital home and did not know the details of their day-to-day life.\r\nHusband\r\n  testified Wife's drinking had been a problem since 1998.Â  He stated Wife drank\r\n  six to ten beers a day combined with prescription medication and acknowledged\r\n  she had a drinking problem.Â  He believed Wife's drunkenness was the primary\r\n  cause for the breakdown of their marriage.\r\nStepdaughter testified that before she moved out of\r\n  the home to attend college, she did not want to be at home because of Wife's\r\n  drinking.Â  She indicated that at times, Wife became intoxicated when\r\n  they were away from home and embarrassed her.Â  She also testified Wife often\r\n  passed out at night and would be drunk when the family went out to dinner.Â  Stepdaughter\r\n  further stated that in 2002 she &quot;made a move in her personal life to move\r\n  [Wife] out of [her] life to a certain extent&quot; but continued to see Wife at\r\n  family functions until the parties separated.\r\nThe\r\n  family court found neither Stepson nor Stepdaughter could provide any\r\n  information to the court concerning eyewitness accounts of Wife's drinking\r\n  habit within one year prior to the parties' separation.Â  The court found &quot;[n]either\r\n  was aware of the extent of [Wife's] drinking habit at that time.&quot;Â  The\r\n  court noted Wife admitted she consumed beer while taking prescription\r\n  medications and taking multiple prescriptions at a time.Â  Although the court\r\n  had &quot;concerns about [Wife's] combining alcohol with prescription\r\n  medications,&quot; it determined Husband's &quot;evidence does not meet the\r\n  level of proof necessary to establish habitual drunkenness.&quot;Â  The court\r\n  found Wife was the one who moved out of the residence and filed the action.Â \r\n  Further, the court noted Wife took Daughter, who was fourteen years old at the\r\n  time, with no objection by Husband, and Husband agreed to Wife having sole custody.Â \r\n  Also, it found Husband had shown little concern for Wife's ability to care for Daughter\r\n  because he had not seen Daughter for three months until the night before the\r\n  hearing.\r\nThe\r\n  family court determined testimony was presented that both parties drank, at\r\n  times together, and Husband admitted he drank on a daily basis.Â  The family\r\n  court further found Husband conceded that over the course of the marriage, Wife\r\n  completed her bachelor's and master's degrees, received her certification or\r\n  license, stayed at home with his children and Daughter, and cared for her\r\n  ailing father.Â  The court also noted Husband's contention that Wife was not\r\n  entitled to alimony and was capable of earning a good salary was inconsistent\r\n  with his claim that she has a drinking problem of such a serious degree that it\r\n  rises to the level of habitual drunkenness and led to the breakdown of the\r\n  marriage.Â  The court found Husband presented no evidence Wife ever attended any\r\n  facility or meeting in regards to her alleged drinking problem or that she had\r\n  any difficulty with her current employment.Â  The court found the\r\n  testimony of Husband and his children was less credible than that of Wife on\r\n  the issue.\r\nMuch\r\n  like Epperly, the parties presented conflicting evidence as to how much\r\n  Wife drank and if it was a problem.Â  Although both Husband's son and daughter\r\n  testified Wife drank too much, neither was around the parties often in the year\r\n  prior to the parties' separation.Â  Because the family court was in the better\r\n  position to see the witnesses and judge their credibility, we defer to its\r\n  determinations on credibility.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's finding\r\n  Husband did not meet his burden of proof.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Alimony\r\nHusband\r\n  contends the family court erred in its determination of alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe amount to be awarded for alimony, as well as a determination\r\n  of whether a spouse is entitled to alimony, is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the family court.Â  Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d\r\n  541, 543 (1975). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled\r\n  by an error of law or is based on factual findings without evidentiary\r\n  support.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as close as is practical,\r\n  in the same position of support as during the marriage.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). Â If the claim for alimony is well-founded, the family court has\r\n  the duty of making &quot;an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and\r\n  just.&quot;Â  Allen v. Allen, 347\r\n  S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  The family court should consider the\r\n  following factors in awarding alimony: \r\n\r\n\t(1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of\r\n  the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history\r\n  and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during\r\n  the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties;\r\n  (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and\r\n  nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital\r\n  misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations;\r\n  as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nDavis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 79-80, 641 S.E.2d 446,\r\n  454&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2009)).Â \r\n  The South Carolina Supreme Court has held &quot;[t]hree important factors in\r\n  awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the overall\r\n  financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the supporting\r\n  spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than the\r\n  other.&quot;Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114,\r\n  121 (2004).Â  In making an alimony award, &quot;[n]o one factor is\r\n  dispositive.&quot;Â  Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 267, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  279, 284 (Ct. App. 2006). Â \r\nFurther, alimony is intended to be neither a reward\r\n  nor a punishment. Kane v. Kane, 280 S.C. 479, 484, 313\r\n  S.E.2d 327, 330 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  &quot;Marital fault is only one of\r\n  the factors the family court must consider in making an award of alimony.&quot;Â  Gilfillin v. Gilfillin, 334 S.C. 213, 222, 512 S.E.2d 534, 538 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999), rev'd on other grounds, 344 S.C. 407, 544 S.E.2d 829 (2001).Â  South\r\n  Carolina courts have awarded spouses alimony in spite of the fact that they had\r\n  fault in the breakup of their marriages.Â  See Lee v. Lee, 282\r\n  S.C. 76, 79-80, 316 S.E.2d 435, 437-38 (Ct. App. 1984) (affirming the award of\r\n  alimony to wife of $150 per month for six months when her habitual drunkenness\r\n  caused the breakup of the marriage and she was able to work); see also Murray v. Murray, 271 S.C. 62, 64, 244 S.E.2d\r\n  538, 539 (1978) (affirming the family court's award of alimony of $400 per\r\n  month for six months when wife's conduct caused the disintegration of the\r\n  marriage and she was able to work).\r\nThe\r\n  family court considered the following factors when making its decision: (1) the\r\n  parties were in a long-term marriage lasting nineteen years; (2) they were thirty-five\r\n  years old when they married and fifty-four at the final hearing; (3) Husband\r\n  was the primary wage earner and was the one responsible for the payment of the\r\n  majority of the marital bills and the creation and operation of several\r\n  businesses; (4) Wife quit her job and relocated to South Carolina from Georgia\r\n  when they married; (5) Wife was the primary caretaker of the parties' child and\r\n  Husband's children; (6) Husband has the greater earning potential even though\r\n  he lacks a four-year college degree; (7) although Wife earned her bachelor's\r\n  and master's degrees during the marriage, she only began her career as a\r\n  counselor around the time the parties separated; (8) Wife's projected gross\r\n  monthly income is $2,500, while Husband's gross monthly income is $11,027; (9)\r\n  Wife has several medical problems; (10) testimony was presented that both\r\n  parties drank on a regular or daily basis and at times, together; (11) no\r\n  misconduct occurred that affected the economic conditions of the parties; (12)\r\n  Wife was granted custody of Daughter and there are no other support\r\n  obligations; and (13) Wife will have the additional expense of health insurance\r\n  because she will no longer be able to be on Husband's policy.Â  The family court\r\n  found Husband's argument that Wife had nonmarital funds available to her\r\n  uncompelling, finding both parties have nonmarital assets and although Wife has\r\n  more than Husband, she also has nonmarital debt and he does not.\r\nHusband\r\n  seems to take issue with the family court's weighing of the factors and wants\r\n  us to reweigh them.Â  However, that is not this court's role in the\r\n  determination of alimony.Â  We look to see if the family court abused its\r\n  discretion.Â  The family court made findings of fact on all of the relevant\r\n  factors, and the record contains evidence to support each of those findings.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding alimony\r\n  or in determining the amount of alimony. Therefore, the family court's award of\r\n  alimony is affirmed.\r\nC.&nbsp; Equitable\r\n  Distribution\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in its apportionment of the marital estate.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;An\r\n  appellate court should approach an equitable division award with a presumption\r\n  that the family court acted within its broad discretion.&quot;Â  Dawkins v. Dawkins,\r\n  386 S.C. 169, 172, 687 S.E.2d 52, 54&nbsp;(2010).Â  The\r\n  division of marital property is within the family court's discretion and will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Â Craig v.\r\n    Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005).Â  The appellate court\r\n  looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment.Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362\r\n  S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  If the end result is\r\n  equitable, the fact that the appellate court would have arrived at a different\r\n  apportionment is irrelevant.Â  Id.\r\nMarital property includes all real and personal property the\r\n  parties acquired during the marriage and owned as of the date of filing or\r\n  commencement of marital litigation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  &quot;The doctrine of equitable distribution is based on a recognition that\r\n  marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership.&quot;Â  Mallett v.\r\n    Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  &quot;Upon dissolution of the\r\n  marriage, property acquired during the marriage should be divided and\r\n  distributed in a manner which fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to its\r\n  acquisition, regardless of which spouse holds legal title.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The ultimate goal of apportionment is to\r\n  divide the marital estate, as a whole, in a manner that fairly reflects each\r\n  spouse's contribution to the economic partnership and also the effect on each\r\n  of the parties of ending that partnership.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 298,\r\n  372 S.E.2d at 112.\r\nIn making an equitable apportionment of marital\r\n  property, the family court must give weight in such proportion as it finds\r\n  appropriate to all of the following factors:(1) the duration of the marriage along with the ages\r\n  of the parties at the time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce; (2) marital misconduct or fault\r\n  of either or both parties, if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic\r\n  circumstances of the parties or contributed to the breakup of the marriage; (3) the value of the marital\r\n  property and the contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation,\r\n  depreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the\r\n  contribution of the spouse as homemaker; (4) the income of each spouse, the\r\n  earning potential of each spouse, and the opportunity for future acquisition of\r\n  capital assets; (5) the\r\n  health, both physical and emotional, of each spouse; (6) either spouse's need for additional training or education\r\n  in order to achieve that spouse's income potential; (7) the nonmarital property of each spouse; (8) the existence or\r\n  nonexistence of vested retirement benefits for each or either spouse; (9) whether separate\r\n  maintenance or alimony has been awarded; (10) the desirability of awarding the family home as part of\r\n  equitable distribution or the right to live therein for reasonable periods to\r\n  the spouse having custody of any children; (11) the tax consequences to each or either party as a result\r\n  of equitable apportionment; (12) the existence and extent of any prior support obligations; (13) liens and any other\r\n  encumbrances upon the marital property and any other existing debts; (14) child custody\r\n  arrangements and obligations at the time of the entry of the order; and (15) such other relevant\r\n  factors as the trial court shall expressly enumerate in its order.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 20-3-620(B) (Supp. 2009).Â  These criteria are intended\r\n  to guide the family court in exercising its discretion over apportionment of\r\n  marital property.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 297, 372 S.E.2d at 112.Â  The family court has the discretion to decide what weight\r\n  to assign various factors.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 393, 399&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  The factors are only equities to be considered in\r\n  reaching a fair distribution of marital property. Â Johnson, 296 S.C. at 297-98, 372 S.E.2d at\r\n  112.\r\n1.&nbsp; Preservation\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court did not consider the tax consequences to him when\r\n  making the distribution.Â  He also contends he requested several credits against\r\n  the marital home and the family court did not address the issue.Â  We find these\r\n  issues unpreserved for our review.\r\nWhen\r\n  the family court does not rule on an issue presented to it, the issue must be\r\n  raised by a post-trial motion to be preserved for appeal.Â  See Feldman\r\n    v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 545, 670 S.E.2d 669, 672 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding\r\n  an issue unpreserved because husband failed to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion\r\n  when family court failed to rule on it). Â Because Husband failed to raise these\r\n  issues in a Rule 59(e) motion, they are unpreserved for our review.[1]Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004)\r\n  (holding issues must be raised to and ruled upon to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review).\r\n2.&nbsp; Ford\r\n  Explorer\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  Husband contends the family court improperly included a Ford Explorer as\r\n  Husband's nonmarital property.Â  He argues the asset was purchased after filing\r\n  and thus it could have no value at the date of filing.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband testified\r\n  he was not sure what funds he used to purchase the vehicle.Â  Wife testified she\r\n  only learned of the vehicle accidently and then Husband testified about it at\r\n  his deposition.Â  Although Husband testified he bought the car after the date of\r\n  filing, the family court found as to that asset, Wife's evidence was credible\r\n  and the vehicle was an asset not disclosed by Husband.Â  Accordingly, as this\r\n  was a matter of credibility, we find the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion. \r\n3.&nbsp; Survey\r\n  Technology, Inc.\r\nHusband\r\n  also claims the family court erred in finding his interest in Survey\r\n  Technology, Inc. was marital property.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  family court found that when the parties married, Husband owned shares in\r\n  Sur-Tech.Â  In May 1995, Articles of Incorporation were filed for Survey\r\n  Technology.Â  In January 1996, Articles of Dissolution were filed, dissolving\r\n  Sur-Tech.Â  In 2004, Husband's current employer bought Survey Technology and\r\n  Husband received eighty-six percent of the proceeds, $118,000, which was placed\r\n  in a money market account.Â  Husband testified at trial Survey Technology was\r\n  the surviving entity in a merger with Sur-Tech.Â  Husband contends that because\r\n  he owned an interest in Sur-Tech prior to the marriage, a portion of the\r\n  proceeds from the sale of Survey Technology were nonmarital.Â  The family court\r\n  found neither Husband nor his expert witness could provide &quot;a value of\r\n  Sur-Tech on the date the [p]arties married or when it was dissolved or merged\r\n  into Survey Technology.Â  Furthermore, no testimony or evidence was presented\r\n  [Husband's] stock in Sur-Tech was of any value whatsoever at the date of\r\n  marriage or when the business was dissolved or merged.&quot;Â  The court found\r\n  Husband \r\n\r\n\tarbitrarily\r\n  assigned a percentage value to the money market account based on the number of\r\n  years he had an interest in Sur-Tech prior to the marriage.Â  Without a value\r\n  assessed to the stock at the date of marriage, the [c]ourt will not speculate\r\n  as to the value of any claimed non-marital component.Â  Both parties identify\r\n  the money market account as a marital asset, and the [c]ourt so finds and\r\n  determines that [Husband] is not entitled to a non-marital component.Â  \r\n\r\nWife\r\n  asserts Husband did not provide any proof the Articles of Merger were filed\r\n  with the Secretary of State; instead, the only evidence was the Articles of\r\n  Dissolution.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-11-105 (2006) (&quot;After a plan\r\n  of merger . . . is approved . . . the surviving or acquiring entity shall\r\n  deliver to the Secretary of State for filing articles of merger . . . . A\r\n  merger . . . takes effect upon the effective date of the articles of merger . .\r\n  . .&quot;).Â  Therefore, Wife contends Survey Technology was a new entity\r\n  created after the parties married and thus, Husband's interest in it was\r\n  marital property.Â  Because Survey Technology was incorporated during the\r\n  marriage and Husband provided Articles of Dissolution instead of Articles of\r\n  Merger, the record contains evidence to support the family court's finding the\r\n  funds were marital.\r\n4.&nbsp; Lease\r\n  Payments \r\nHusband also\r\n  contends the family court improperly valued Survey Leasing, Inc. by engaging in\r\n  &quot;double dipping.&quot;Â  He asserts the family court improperly included\r\n  lease payments from Survey Leasing in his income when calculating temporary\r\n  alimony and child support.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Husband's expert asserted the lease payments should not be classified\r\n  both as income and as property subject to equitable division.Â  Husband\r\n  requested that the full temporary alimony payments be deducted from the value\r\n  of the lease payments.Â  However, the family court found the lease payment\r\n  income was only a part of the income the family court used in calculating\r\n  temporary alimony and child support.Â  The court further found the evidence\r\n  confirmed Wife's contention Husband vastly under-reported his income at the\r\n  temporary hearing and thus should not be allowed to benefit from his\r\n  misrepresentations.Â  At the temporary hearing, Husband represented his 2005\r\n  salary was $65,000 or $73,000 per year, but at the final hearing, he admitted\r\n  his 2005 W-2 reflected annual wages of $111,177.Â  The family court found\r\n  Husband had unclean hands and would not reward his misrepresentations by a\r\n  downward adjustment equal to the value of the lease payments.Â  Wife notes\r\n  the salary Husband admitted at trial is virtually identical to the salary the\r\n  family court used to calculate his temporary alimony and child support. Â \r\nIn Buckley\r\n  v. Shealy, 370 S.C. 317, 324-25, 635 S.E.2d 76, 79-80&nbsp;(2006), the family court gave Husband an equitable set-off for &quot;overpayments&quot;\r\n  of child support husband made for six years despite the fact that he\r\n  failed to make timely child support payments for almost thirteen years. Â The\r\n  supreme court found husband was not entitled to an equitable set-off because of\r\n  his own misdeeds in dealing with wife and the court and reversed the family\r\n  court's decision awarding husband a set-off.Â  Id. at 325, 635 S.E.2d at\r\n  80.\r\nHere, if family court had not included the lease\r\n  payments as martial property, Husband would have been rewarded for his\r\n  dishonesty about his income.Â  Further, because Husband's correct income is basically\r\n  the same as the lesser income he provided for the temporary payments with the\r\n  lease payments added to it, we find no prejudice to Husband.Â  See McCall\r\n    v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;[W]hatever\r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in including the lease payments as marital\r\n  property. \r\n5.&nbsp; Overall\r\n  Distribution\r\nHusband\r\n  seems to disagree with the family court's findings as to several of the relevant\r\n  factors.Â  Much of his argument seems to be taking issue with the family court's\r\n  findings but many of those findings relate to witness credibility.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Husband seeks to assign weight to the factors differently than the family court\r\n  did in determining the equitable distribution.Â  Because the record includes\r\n  evidence to support those findings, the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the overall distribution of the estate appears fair.Â  Although Husband did\r\n  bring more money into the marriage through his salary, Wife contributed to the\r\n  marriage by being a stay-at-home mom to the parties' child and Husband's two\r\n  children that lived with them.Â  Although Husband presented some testimony Wife\r\n  did not contribute much to the household, Wife's testimony was to the\r\n  contrary.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's equitable distribution. \r\nD.&nbsp; Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\nFinally,\r\n  Husband maintains the family court erred in awarding Wife attorney's fees.Â  He\r\n  also contends the issue should be reversed and remanded.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has discretion in deciding whether to award\r\n  attorney's fees, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d\r\n  741, 748 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled\r\n  by an error of law or is based on factual findings lacking evidentiary\r\n  support.Â  Degenhart, 360 S.C. at 500, 602 S.E.2d at 97.Â  In deciding\r\n  whether to award attorney's fees, the family court should consider (1) each\r\n  party's ability to pay his or her own fee, (2) the beneficial results obtained\r\n  by the attorney, (3) the parties' respective financial conditions, and (4) the\r\n  effect of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  Patel, 359 S.C.\r\n  at 533, 599 S.E.2d at 123.Â  In determining reasonable attorney's fees, the six\r\n  factors the family court should consider are &quot;(1) the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3)\r\n  professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5)\r\n  beneficial results obtained; [and] (6) customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.&quot;Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court has previously held when parties fail to cooperate and their behavior\r\n  prolongs proceedings, this is a basis for holding them responsible for\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  Anderson v. Tolbert, 322 S.C. 543, 549-50, 473\r\n  S.E.2d 456, 459-60 (Ct. App. 1996); see also Donahue, 299 S.C. at 365, 384 S.E.2d 748 (holding husband's\r\n  &quot;lack of cooperation . . . serves as an additional basis for the award of\r\n  attorney['s] fees&quot;); Johnson, 296 S.C. at 304, 372 S.E.2d at 115\r\n  (citing husband's lack of cooperation in discovery as a basis for increasing\r\n  wife's attorney fee award on appeal). &quot;An adversary spouse should not be\r\n  rewarded for such conduct.&quot;Â  Anderson, 322 S.C. at 549, 473 S.E.2d at 459.\r\nIn\r\n  determining if attorney's fees were appropriate, the family court stated it\r\n  considered each party's ability to pay the attorney's fees, their respective\r\n  financial conditions, the beneficial results obtained by his or her attorney,\r\n  and the effect of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  The court found\r\n  Husband was &quot;in far better financial condition to pay [Wife's] attorney's\r\n  fees than she is based upon their respective incomes and the effect on their\r\n  standard of living.&quot;Â  &quot;Additionally, the [c]ourt considered the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by [Wife's] attorney in regards to the ground for\r\n  divorce, alimony, equitable division, and pursuit of asset and income\r\n  information that was made more difficult due to the conduct of [Husband].&quot;Â \r\n  Therefore, the family court found the overall results were more beneficial to\r\n  Wife.\r\nOnce\r\n  the family court determined an award was appropriate, the court considered the\r\n  factors in Glasscock as to the amount of the award.Â  The court found the\r\n  extent of services, difficulty, and time invested to the case were all substantial\r\n  in that discovery and pursuit of financial information were major issues in the\r\n  case.Â  The family court found Wife's counsel was experienced in family law and\r\n  her rates were well within those customarily charged.Â  As of the date of trial,\r\n  the family court found Wife had incurred over $20,000 in attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Accordingly, the family court found an award of $15,000 to Wife for\r\n  attorney's fees was reasonable.\r\nThe\r\n  family court considered all of the appropriate factors and stated how those\r\n  factors supported awarding Wife attorney's fees.Â  The record contains evidence\r\n  to support each of the family court's findings.Â  Wife prevailed on most of the\r\n  issues, and Husband has the ability to pay the fees.Â  On appeal, Husband admits\r\n  Wife prevailed on nearly every issue and relies on his other assertions of error\r\n  in support of his argumentâ€”the family court erred in not granting him a divorce\r\n  based on Wife's habitual drunkenness, its equitable distribution, and its award\r\n  of alimony.Â  Because we do not find that the family court erred in those\r\n  determinations, Wife did in fact receive beneficial results.Â  Husband also\r\n  admits Wife's counsel has a good reputation and has hourly rates consistent\r\n  with lawyers in the area she practices. Because the evidence in the record\r\n  supports the family court's findings as to attorney's fees, it did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in awarding attorney's fees and calculating the amount. \r\nII.&nbsp; WIFE'S APPEAL\r\nA.&nbsp; Credit for Equity in the\r\n  Marital Residence\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in giving Husband a credit against the equity in\r\n  the marital home because he paid the down payment as the funds were transmuted\r\n  into marital property.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  spouse claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the marriage\r\n  has the burden of proving the property is part of the marital es[t]ate. Â If she\r\n  carries this burden, she establishes a prima facie case that the property is\r\n  marital property.Â  \r\n\tIf the\r\n  opposing spouse then wishes to claim that the property so identified is not\r\n  part of the marital estate, he has the burden of presenting evidence to\r\n  establish its nonmarital character. \r\n\r\nJohnson,&nbsp;296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110 (citation omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  spouse claiming nonmarital property has\r\n  been transmuted to marital property must produce objective evidence showing the\r\n  parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage\r\n  during the marriage. Â Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11.Â  Evidence of\r\n  transmutation includes jointly titling the property, using the property\r\n  exclusively for marital purposes, commingling the property with marital\r\n  property so that it becomes untraceable, or using marital funds to build equity\r\n  in the property. Â Id.Â \r\n  &quot;The mere use of separate property to support\r\n  the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as\r\n  property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.&quot; Â Johnson,&nbsp;296 S.C. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111.Â \r\n  Whether separate property has been transmuted into marital property is a matter\r\n  of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case. Â Simpson v. Simpson,\r\n  377 S.C. 527, 538, 660 S.E.2d 278, 284&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nIn Greene\r\n  v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 337, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002), wife\r\n  borrowed $10,000 from her father to make a down payment on property.Â  &quot;Although\r\n  the family court 'recognized a contribution on [wife's] behalf in the amount of\r\n  $10,000 in the overall equitable division of the marital estate,' the family\r\n  court nonetheless included the full equitable value of [the property] in\r\n  valuing the marital estate for equitable distribution.&quot; Â Id.Â  This\r\n  court found the $10,000 was wife's separate property and modified the family\r\n  court's order to subtract $10,000 from the assigned value of the property for\r\n  purposes of equitable distribution.Â  Id.\r\nAlso\r\n  in Greene, the family court found $20,000 of the equity in a $50,500\r\n  property attributable to wife's contribution of premarital funds as a down\r\n  payment on the property and assigned the property a value of $30,500 for\r\n  purposes of equitable distribution. Â Id. at 341, 569 S.E.2d at 400.Â  However,\r\n  the court awarded the property to husband with a value of $30,500, giving wife\r\n  the option of retaining the property by paying husband $30,500. Â Id.Â  This\r\n  court found wife was entitled to a $20,000 credit for her nonmarital\r\n  contribution toward the acquisition of the property. Â Id.\r\nWife\r\n  initially testified she could not remember who made the down payment on the marital\r\n  home.Â  Wife later testified that both she and Husband contributed the down\r\n  payment but she could not remember how much each contributed and Husband could\r\n  have contributed &quot;a good bit more.&quot;Â  On cross-examination, Wife\r\n  testified that the money she put towards the home would have come from the sale\r\n  of her home and her salary.Â  She also acknowledged that when she sold her home\r\n  in Georgia, she had two mortgages on it and she was behind on the payments for a\r\n  condominium she owned.Â  Husband testified because he alone contributed the\r\n  funds for down payment of the home, it was titled solely in his name.Â  He also\r\n  testified that Wife used any money she received from the sale of her home in\r\n  Georgia to pay towards the arrears on her condominium.\r\nThe\r\n  family court found in light of Husband's testimony and evidence of the proceeds\r\n  of the sale of his premarital home and other funds he had at the time and\r\n  Wife's testimony as to the proceeds from her home and the debt on her\r\n  condominium, Husband was more credible on the issue.Â  We defer to the family\r\n  court as to who contributed the down payment because it is a matter of\r\n  credibility. Â Much like Wife in Greene, here, Husband contributed the\r\n  down payment to purchase property that was marital property.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  affirm the family court's awarding Husband the $81,707 credit.\r\nB.&nbsp; Georgetown Property\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to include the entire value of the\r\n  Georgetown Property in the marital estate because the Husband used marital\r\n  funds to purchase the property, which violated the family court's temporary\r\n  order.Â  We find this issue is unpreserved for our review.\r\n&quot;An\r\n  issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an\r\n  issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court.&quot;Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732\r\n  (2004).Â  Although at trial Wife argued Husband should be found in contempt for\r\n  dissipating the asset, she never argued she was entitled to special equity in the\r\n  Georgetown Property.Â  In Wife's testimony, she states that Husband paid\r\n  $250,000 for the property although clearly only $157,623 was taken from the\r\n  money market account.Â  In the order, the family court reinstates the money\r\n  market value to what it was before Husband removed the money.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the court lists the Georgetown Property as a marital asset and sets its\r\n  adjusted value at $82,718.\r\nIn Wife's\r\n  59(e) motion she contends &quot;the [family] [c]ourt erred in issuing its\r\n  judgment . . . [b]y finding the Georgetown [P]roperty purchased by [Husband]\r\n  had an adjusted value of $82,718.&quot;Â  In the final order, the family court\r\n  found the net value of $250,000 was adjusted for the $167,282 reinstated value\r\n  of the money market account that Husband used to purchase the Georgetown\r\n  Property.Â  The family court set that adjusted value at $82,718.Â  However,\r\n  Husband used $156,644 from the money market account, not the entire account. Â Therefore,\r\n  the adjusted value should have been $92,377.Â  Because Wife's argument in her\r\n  59(e) motion is unclear and unspecific, we cannot discern exactly what she is arguing.Â \r\n  Seemingly, she is referring to this incorrect figure and not requesting a\r\n  special equity. Â See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587\r\n  S.E.2d 691, 693-94&nbsp;(2003) (&quot;A party need not use the exact name of a\r\n  legal doctrine in order to preserve it, but it must be clear that the argument\r\n  has been presented on that ground.&quot;).Â  Further, any request at the 59(e)\r\n  stage of the proceedings was untimely because Wife could have raised it at\r\n  trial.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C.,&nbsp;372\r\n  S.C. 295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907&nbsp;(2007) (&quot;[A]n issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time in a post-trial motion.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  this issue is unpreserved for our review.\r\nC.\r\n  Life Insurance Stipulation\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in determining her life insurance policy was\r\n  marital property because the parties stipulated it was not marital property.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  stipulation is an agreement, admission, or concession\r\n  made in judicial proceedings by the parties or their attorneys and is binding\r\n  upon those who make them. Â The court must accept stipulations as binding upon\r\n  the parties.&quot;Â  McCrea v. City of Georgetown, 384 S.C. 328, 332, 681\r\n  S.E.2d 918, 921&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (citation omitted).Â  In his brief, Husband\r\n  states he agreed at trial that the policy was Wife's nonmarital asset and his\r\n  forensic accountant testified to the same.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred\r\n  in including the $804 life insurance policy as marital property in the\r\n  equitable division.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  family court did not err in failing to grant Husband a divorce on the ground of\r\n  habitual drunkenness, in its award of alimony and attorney's fees, or in its\r\n  overall equitable distribution.Â  However, the family court erred in determining\r\n  Wife's life insurance policy was a marital asset when the parties stipulated it\r\n  was not.Â  Accordingly, the family court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband did raise these issues in a motion for a\r\n  new trial pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP, asserting he was entitled to a new\r\n  trial because of &quot;mistakes of the [family] court, which may have been\r\n  based wholly or partially upon [Wife's] fraud and misrepresentation.&quot;Â  Any\r\n  alleged fraud by Wife would have no impact on the family court's failure to\r\n  rule on these issues.Â  Therefore, a 59(e) motion would have been the proper\r\n  vehicle for raising the family court's failure to rule on those issues.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding when a trial court fails to address the specific\r\n  argument raised by the appellant, the appellant must make a motion to alter or\r\n  amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument or\r\n  matter is not preserved for appellate review); see also Doe v. Doe,\r\n  370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;[W]hen an appellant\r\n  neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
