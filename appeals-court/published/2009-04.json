Cook, II, of Batesburg-Leesville, for Appellant.\r\n        Ann Mickle, of Rock Hill, and Tom Young, Jr., of Aiken, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.:Â  In this workers' compensation case, the Uninsured\r\n    Employers' Fund (the Fund) appeals the circuit court's order reversing the Appellate\r\n    Panel's denial of Chad W. Mead's (Mead) application for a change of condition\r\n    for the worse to his left hip and leg allegedly caused by his original compensable\r\n    injury.Â  The Fund asserts the circuit court erred in failing to affirm the\r\n    Appellate Panel's finding that the claim for a change of condition was barred\r\n    by res judicata.Â  We agree.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn late January or early February 2000, Mead sustained an on-the-job\r\n  injury.Â  Mead alleged injuries to his right leg, right hip, and back arising\r\n  out of and in the course of his employment with Jessex Inc., d/b/a Midlands\r\n  Glass (Jessex).Â  Initially, Jessex and the Fund denied Mead's claim, contending\r\n  the injury was not sustained on the job.Â  \r\nThe first hearing regarding Mead's compensation occurred on\r\n  November 7, 2001, before Commissioner Holly Saleeby Atkins.Â  On April 1, 2002, Commissioner\r\n  Atkins issued her order finding that Mead &quot;sustained an injury by accident\r\n  to his right hip and right leg arising out of and in the course and scope of\r\n  his employment,&quot; and that the injury was compensable under the South\r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation Act.Â  Commissioner Atkins further found that Mead\r\n  had a preexisting condition of avascular necrosis in his right leg and hip\r\n  which was aggravated by his compensable injury.Â  However, Commissioner Atkins\r\n  specifically found Mead did not sustain a compensable back injury.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 21, 2003, Commissioner, J. Alan Bass, presided over a second hearing\r\n  regarding Mead's injuries.Â  Mead sought a final determination of the extent of\r\n  disability he sustained to his right lower extremity and a determination of\r\n  disability to his back as a result of the original compensable injury.Â  Mead reached\r\n  maximum medical improvement after the first hearing and the commissioner determined\r\n  that he had a sixty percent loss of use of his right lower extremity.Â  \r\nAt the March 2003 hearing, Mead testified that he began\r\n  experiencing pain in his left hip and left leg in December 2002 or January 2003\r\n  as a result of having to shift his weight from his right leg to his left leg\r\n  when standing.Â  Mead contended that he bore &quot;pretty much all&quot; of his\r\n  weight on his left leg.Â  When Commissioner Bass specifically asked Mead if he\r\n  believed his left hip and left leg problems arose from shifting his weight from\r\n  his right to left leg, Mead responded,Â  &quot;I personally do.&quot;Â  \r\nCommissioner Bass found that the total right hip replacement Mead\r\n  underwent following the first hearing caused Mead to have an altered gait. Â Furthermore,\r\n  the &quot;altered gait caused [Mead] to develop lower back pain.&quot; Commissioner\r\n  Bass determined the back pain Mead complained of was directly related to his\r\n  original compensable injury.Â  Thus, the back pain was also a compensable\r\n  injury. \r\nFurther, Commissioner Bass rejected Jessex's and the Fund's\r\n  contention that Mead's back claim was barred by res judicata;\r\n  rather, he found that Mead's &quot;back claim is based on an altered gait which\r\n  was not before the Commissioner at the November 7, 2001 hearing and did not\r\n  manifest itself until after the November 7, 2001 hearing.&quot;Â  However, Commissioner\r\n  Bass specifically stated in his factual findings and conclusions of law that\r\n  Mead failed to prove that his left hip symptoms were related to the original\r\n  compensable right hip and right leg injury that occurred in 2000.Â  Neither\r\n  party appealed Commissioner Bass' order.Â  \r\nSubsequently, on June 2, 2006, there was a third hearing before Commissioner\r\n  J. Michelle Childs.Â  At this hearing, Mead alleged a change of condition for\r\n  the worse, seeking &quot;a finding that his left hip problems are causally\r\n  related to his original injury such that the left hip problems and the\r\n  treatment needed for the left hip will be compensable.&quot;[1]Â  Mead presented the opinion of Dr.\r\n  Holford, the authorized treating physician, who based his opinion on a review of the March 21, 2003 hearing transcript,\r\n  Mead's past medical records, and a physical examination.Â  Commissioner Childs relied on Dr. Holford's opinion during\r\n  the hearing.Â  \r\nIn Dr. Holford's questionnaire responses, dated October 29, 2004,\r\n  he stated that the pain Mead complained of during the hearing before Commissioner\r\n  Bass was due to the natural progression of his avascular necrosis.Â  Later in\r\n  the same report, Dr. Holford opined that, based on his treatment and\r\n  examination of Mead, Mead's complaints at the time of the 2004 report were &quot;related\r\n  to an aggravation of his pre-existing avascular necrosis of the left hip caused\r\n  by his altered gait.&quot;Â  \r\nCommissioner Childs stated in her factual determinations that\r\n  Mead's change of condition claim for his left hip and leg was an entirely new\r\n  problem that manifested itself after the March 21, 2003 hearing.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Commissioner Childs found:Â  &quot;The authorized treating physician Dr. Douglas\r\n  Holford has verified that he read the hearing transcript of March 21, 2003[,]\r\n  and his opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty is that the current left hip complaints are new and different from the left hip symptoms\r\n  prior to March 21, 2003.&quot;Â  (emphasis in original).Â  Commissioner Childs found\r\n  that Mead's claim was compensable and the Fund's res judicata argument failed.Â  \r\nThe Fund appealed Commissioner Childs' findings to the Appellate Panel.Â \r\n  The Appellate Panel determined the &quot;order of Commissioner Childs [] must\r\n  be reversed because it [was] based upon legal error in finding that [Mead's]\r\n  injury to his left hip and left leg were compensable.&quot;Â  Further, the\r\n  Appellate Panel determined that Mead's left hip injury claim was barred by res judicata because the claim was previously ruled on by Commissioner Bass,\r\n  and because the court in Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglass, 313 S.C.\r\n  181, 437 S.E.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1993) held that a change of condition claim based\r\n  on an alleged worsening of condition, that was previously ruled on, was barred\r\n  by res judicata.Â  The Appellate Panel made the following\r\n  findings:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n     That the claimant\r\n  raised the issue of the compensability of the alleged injury to his left hip at\r\n  the hearing on March 21, 2003.&nbsp; This finding of fact is supported by the\r\n  transcript of that hearing, as well as the claimant's Form 50 and prehearing\r\n  brief.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    That the June 3, 2003,\r\n  order finds, concludes and orders that the alleged injury to the claimant's\r\n  left leg and left hip were not compensable.&nbsp; This finding of fact is supported\r\n  by the order in question, including finding of fact number 6 and conclusion of\r\n  law number 7.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    That the claimant did\r\n  not appeal the order of June 3, 2003, at all and specifically not with regard\r\n  to that part of the order ruling that the alleged injury to the left leg and\r\n  left hip were not compensable.&nbsp; This finding of fact is not disputed and, in\r\n  any event, is clearly shown by the absence in the file of the Commission of any\r\n  Form 30 appealing that order.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    That the unappealed\r\n  order of June 3, 2003, bars the claimant's current claim for the compensability\r\n  of the left hip and left leg under the doctrine of res judicata.\r\n  \r\n\r\nMead\r\n  appealed the Appellate Panel's decision to the circuit court.Â  The circuit\r\n  court reversed the Appellate Panel, finding the Appellate Panel erred as a\r\n  matter of law when it ruled Mead's application for compensation for his left\r\n  leg and left hip condition was precluded by res judicata.Â  The\r\n  circuit court found that the instant case was controlled by Estridge v.\r\n    Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 482 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1997).[2]Â  In addition, the circuit court\r\n  stated that the Fund and the Appellate Panel &quot;erroneously assume that\r\n  [Mead's] left leg and hip symptoms are the same as those existing prior to and\r\n  following the March 21, 2003 hearing.&quot; The court found Mead's post-March\r\n  21, 2003 symptoms were compensable because they fell within the definition of a\r\n  change of condition, as defined by Estridge and recognized in Owenby.Â \r\n  In reaching its conclusion, the circuit court relied on Dr. Holford's opinion\r\n  during the hearing before Commissioner Childs:Â  &quot;The left leg and hip\r\n  injuries at issue here have not been litigated previously, nor were they\r\n  introduced in the underlying action, because the change of condition did not\r\n  yet exist.Â  Dr. Holford has confirmed this with his medical opinion â€“ the only\r\nevidence in this record.&quot;Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the circuit court stated that the Appellate Panel erred by focusing its\r\n  reasoning on Commissioner Bass' unappealed order.Â  The circuit court ruled that\r\n  Mead's claim was for a change of condition â€” new symptoms manifesting in the\r\n  same body part â€” and therefore, the claim was not barred by res judicata pursuant to Owenby and Estridge.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review\r\n  for decisions by the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  Lark\r\n    v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Thompson\r\n      v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 611, 632 S.E.2d 874, 877 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006).\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380 (Supp. 2008) provides that in judicial review of a decision of an\r\n  administrative agency, \r\n\r\n  The court may\r\n    not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the weight of\r\n    the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the\r\n    agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or\r\n    modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced\r\n    because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:\r\n    [] (d) affected by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n    reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing workers' compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains &quot;whether\r\n  the circuit court properly determined whether the [A]ppellate [P]anel's\r\n  findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and\r\n  whether the [P]anel's decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;&nbsp; Baxter\r\n    v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  &quot;'Substantial evidence' is evidence which,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.&quot;Â  Clark v. Aiken Cty. Gov't, 366 S.C. 102, 107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).&nbsp; \r\n&quot;Under\r\n  our scope of review, the findings of the commission will not be set aside if\r\n  they are supported by substantial evidence and not controlled by error of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Estridge, 325 S.C. at 536, 482 S.E.2d at 579.Â  The circuit\r\n  court may reverse or modify the decision of the Appellate Panel if substantial\r\n  rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative\r\n  findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are affected by error of law or\r\n  are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record.Â  Thompson, 369 S.C. at 612, 632 S.E.2d at\r\n  878.Â  Accordingly, an appellate court may not &quot;substitute its judgment for\r\n  that of the [Appellate Panel] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of\r\n  fact.&quot;&nbsp; West v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 251, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 279, 282 (Ct. App. 2006).&nbsp; \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fund asserts the circuit\r\n  court erred in failing to affirm the Appellate Panel's determination that the\r\n  claim for a change of condition was barred by res judicata.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe doctrine of res judicata prevents the\r\n  relitigation of issues previously decided between the same parties, and it is\r\n  shown if (1) the identities of the parties are the same as in the prior\r\n  litigation; (2) the subject matter is the same as in the prior litigation; and\r\n  (3) there was a prior adjudication of the issue by a court of competent\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Johnson v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 317 S.C. 248, 250-51,\r\n  452 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1994).Â  All three elements are present in the case at\r\n  hand. Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel correctly determined that Mead's claim for a change of\r\n  condition was barred by res judicata because the left hip and leg symptoms alleged to Commissioner Bass\r\n  and found not compensable, were the same symptoms subsequently brought before\r\n  Commissioner Childs in the change of condition proceeding.Â  As such, res judicata barred relitigation of the issue of compensability for Mead's\r\n  left hip and leg symptoms.Â  Mead's initial Form 50, dated August 8, 2002, and\r\n  amended prior to the hearing before Commissioner Bass, stated that Mead\r\n  sustained an accidental injury to his back and both legs.Â  At the hearing\r\n  before Commissioner Bass, Mead complained of left hip and leg pain that\r\n  resulted from having to shift his weight from his right leg to his left leg.Â  In\r\n  the order dated June 3, 2003, Commissioner Bass specifically found that &quot;Claimant\r\n  failed to prove his left leg symptoms, which appeared three years after the\r\n  original injury, were related to the original injury.&quot;Â  He also concluded\r\n  as a matter of law that &quot;Claimant fails to prove that the left hip\r\n  symptoms which appeared three years after the original injury are related to\r\n  the original injury.&quot;Â  It is undisputed that Mead did not appeal the order\r\n  of Commissioner Bass. Â Therefore, it is the law of the case that Mead's left\r\n  hip and left leg claim was not compensable.Â  Brunson v. American Koyo\r\n    Bearings, 367 S.C. 161, 165-66, 623 S.E.2d 870, 872 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (factual findings and conclusions of law of the single commissioner become the\r\n  law of the case when not challenged on appeal).Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the hearing before Commissioner Bass, Mead filed a second Form 50, dated\r\n  January 13, 2004, claiming that he sustained a change of condition to his left\r\n  hip, left leg, and back.Â  The doctrine of res judicata barred\r\n  this second attempt at a claim for the left hip and left leg symptoms which were\r\n  initially found not to be compensable. \r\nMoreover, Mead's claim for compensability of his left\r\n  hip and left leg condition on the basis of a change of condition is controlled\r\n  by this Court's decision in Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglass, 313 S.C.\r\n  181, 437 S.E.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In that case, this Court held that the doctrine of res judicata barred\r\n  the award of workers' compensation benefits for Owenby's psychological problems,\r\n  despite her claim of a change of condition.Â  313 S.C. at 183, 437 S.E.2d at\r\n  131-32.Â  In Owenby, the commissioner awarded compensation for Owenby's\r\n  injury to her finger but, because he found her evidence not credible, denied\r\n  compensation for her alleged psychological problems as he found any\r\n  psychological problems suffered by Owenby were not proximately caused by the\r\n  injury to her finger.Â  Id. When Owenby later sought an increase in\r\n  benefits due to the amputation of an additional portion of her finger, she also\r\n  alleged that her psychological condition had worsened.Â  Id.Â  This Court\r\n  held that her attempt to obtain compensation for her psychological condition\r\n  was barred by res judicata.Â  Id.Â  As the commissioner had\r\n  previously determined that any psychological problems Owenby may have had were\r\n  not related to the injury to her finger, she could not relitigate the same\r\n  issue based on a change of condition.Â  Id.Â  This Court also noted that\r\n  the statute allowing review based on a change of condition applies only to\r\n  claims that have been previously found compensable.Â  Id.[3] Â \r\nLikewise, in the instant case, Mead is barred from relitigating\r\n  the same issue regarding his left hip and left leg.Â  There was a prior finding\r\n  of non-compensability regarding Mead's left hip and left leg symptoms by\r\n  Commissioner Bass, which was not appealed, and therefore, under the Owenby standard, the change of condition statute does not apply to his claim. \r\nThus, we find that the circuit court erred in reversing the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision that Mead's claim for a change of condition was\r\n  barred by res judicata.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. section 42-17-90 (Supp. 2008) in the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Act provides a mechanism for reopening an award if there has been a change in\r\n  condition.Â  That section provides in relevant part: \r\n\r\n  (A) On its own\r\n    motion or on the application of a party in interest on the ground of a change\r\n    in condition, the commission may review an award and on that review may make an\r\n    award ending, diminishing, or increasing the compensation previously awarded,\r\n    on proof by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a change of\r\n    condition caused by the original injury, after the last payment of\r\n    compensation.\r\n\r\n[2] In Estridge,\r\n  this Court held that a mental condition that is induced by a compensable physical\r\n  injury is causally related to that physical injury, and thus may be compensated\r\n  in a change of condition workers' compensation proceeding as part of the original\r\n  injury.Â  Id. \r\n[3] See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Edge, 151\r\n  S.E.2d 170 (Ga. App. 1966) (res judicata barred a subsequent\r\n  claim for a change of condition involving an injury that was previously found\r\n  not to be compensable).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4526","title":"State v.

He testified it did not appear Child was\r\n  strangled by her blanket. Â He further testified some of Child's injuries were\r\n  consistent with a 300-pound man jumping on her.[2]Â \r\n  During the autopsy, Dr. Maynard discovered a bite mark on Child's right breast\r\n  and took a swab of the area.Â  Upon testing, it was discovered the saliva\r\n  matched co-defendant James Sanders' DNA.Â  Dr.\r\n  Maynard testified the bruise on Child's breast was a similar age as the rest of\r\n  her injuries, which all seemed to be inflicted at approximately the same time. Â The police also discovered semen on Child's\r\n  pants, which matched Sanders' DNA.Â  No other semen was found on or near Child's\r\n  body. \r\nCope was first interviewed at the police station at about 8:00\r\n  a.m. on November 29, 2001.Â  Cope consented to giving samples for a DNA test.Â  Later\r\n  that same day, about 12:00 p.m., police again interviewed Cope.Â  His story\r\n  changed slightly in the second interview as to the time his daughters went to\r\n  bed and whether he had to kick in Child's bedroom door to enter her room that\r\n  morning.Â  Cope was allowed to leave the station after the second interview.Â  At\r\n  10:50 p.m., police picked Cope up from his mother's house to take him back to\r\n  the police station for a third interview.Â  After the third interview, the\r\n  officers decided to arrest Cope. \r\nCharlene Blackwelder, detective for Rock Hill Police Department,\r\n  took the arrest warrant to Judge Margy McNeely between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. on\r\n  November 30, 2001.Â  Judge McNeely issued the warrant based on the fact that\r\n  Cope was the only adult home at the time of the murder and the lack of evidence\r\n  of forced entry.Â  Cope was placed in a cell at about 2:30 a.m. and he was\r\n  charged with murder at 4:31 a.m.Â  \r\nLater, on the morning of November 30th, Cope was served with three\r\n  warrants for unlawful neglect toward a minor child.[3]Â  Blackwelder testified she served\r\n  Cope with these warrants prior to his transportation to the Moss Justice Center at about 10:00 a.m. for his polygraph examination.Â  Michael Baker,\r\n  polygraph examiner at York County Sheriff's Office, read Cope his Miranda[4] warnings and Cope voluntarily waived\r\n  his constitutional rights.Â  After the exam, Baker informed Cope he had failed\r\n  the polygraph exam.Â  Lieutenant Herring and Baker continued questioning him.Â \r\n  Cope gave his first confession at 2:25 p.m.Â  Cope stated he awoke at 3:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, went into Child's\r\n  room, and masturbated while she was sleeping. Child woke up and said, &quot;gross, daddy,&quot; which\r\n  angered Cope, so he jumped on top of her and began swinging his fists at her\r\n  head.Â  He slammed her head onto a video\r\n  game on her bed and strangled her with both hands.Â  He also used the blanket to\r\n  choke her.Â  Cope then used a broom handle both anally and vaginally on Child.Â  Before\r\n  going back to bed, he deleted temporary internet files from his computer and\r\n  threw away his dildo. \r\nAt a bond hearing on December 1, 2001, Cope was approved for\r\n  representation by a public defender. Â Later, on December 2, 2001, he told the\r\n  police he wanted to talk to them again.Â  On December 3, 2001, officers spoke\r\n  with Cope again and Cope told them his prior statements were incorrect.Â  In his second confession at 9:45 a.m., Cope said he was asleep and had a dream about an old\r\n  girlfriend that had aborted his child.Â  He got so angry that he jumped on her,\r\n  beat her, and raped her with the broom.Â  He did not realize it was Child until\r\n  he fell backwards and was jarred to his senses.Â  He then tried to throw away\r\n  everything in the house that made him look guilty and he pulled up her pants.Â  He\r\n  went back to bed and when he woke up, he hoped it was a dream.Â  After his second confession, Cope agreed to go back to\r\n  his house with the police to reenact the crime on videotape.Â  Cope gave his\r\n  third confession at 4:55 p.m. when they returned to the police department. Â In\r\n  the third confession, Cope confessed he had been going into Child's room since\r\n  the end of October and &quot;playing with her&quot; by fingering her while she\r\n  was asleep.Â  That night, when he went into her room, she was asleep on her\r\n  stomach and he inserted his dildo inside her, waking her.Â  He then attacked and\r\n  strangled her.Â  He cleaned up, closed her bedroom door, and went to bed. \r\nDuring Cope's third confession, Cope's appointed counsel arrived.Â \r\n  Captain Cabaniss of the Rock Hill Police Department testified he informed Cope\r\n  an attorney was there to meet with him, but Cope replied he did not want to see\r\n  the attorney.Â  Cope signed a statement to that effect. \r\nCope\r\n  presented an expert who testified he scored Cope's polygraph examination and\r\n  Cope passed the examination.Â  Cope presented another expert, Dr. Clay Nichols,\r\n  who testified Child's injuries were not specifically consistent with a 300-pound\r\n  man jumping on her and there was no indication a broom was used on Child in the\r\n  assault.Â  Nichols also testified he did not see any signs of chronic sexual\r\n  abuse.Â  Additionally, Cope presented a locksmith to testify the doors could be\r\n  opened with either a credit card or driver's license or by picking the lock\r\n  without showing signs of forced entry.\r\nThe\r\n  jury convicted Cope and this appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  &quot;The trial judge has considerable latitude in\r\n  ruling on the admissibility of evidence and his decision should not be\r\n  disturbed absent prejudicial abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Clasby,\r\n  Op. No. 26705 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 17, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37,\r\n  at 29, 34) (citing State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72\r\n  (1997)).\r\n\r\nA.Â \r\n  Admissibility of Similar Crimes\r\nCope argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit\r\n  evidence of similar crimes in the Rock Hill area allegedly perpetrated by\r\n  Sanders, contending this evidence was probative in identifying Sanders as the\r\n  sole perpetrator and in showing a common scheme pervaded both the other crimes\r\n  and the matter at issue in this appeal.Â  Cope argues he should at least have\r\n  been able to introduce evidence of the other crimes without referring to\r\n  Sanders as the perpetrator.Â  Cope cites numerous jurisdictions and legal\r\n  articles indicating when a defendant is attempting to introduce &quot;other\r\n  crimes&quot; evidence, the court should apply a lower standard of similarity.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admissibility of &quot;other crimes&quot; evidence is governed in South Carolina\r\n  by Rule 404(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, which provides:Â  &quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\r\n  prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity\r\n  therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the\r\n  existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or\r\n  intent.&quot;Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; see State v. Lyle, 125 S.C.\r\n  406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923) (finding such evidence admissible to show\r\n  motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of\r\n  mistake or accident, or intent).Â  \r\nTo\r\n  be admissible against a defendant in a criminal proceeding as evidence of\r\n  identity, &quot;the bad act must logically relate to the crime with which the\r\n  defendant has been charged.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 211,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006).Â  In contrast, to admit evidence about other bad\r\n  acts against an accused to show the existence of a common scheme or plan,\r\n  &quot;[a] close degree of similarity establishes the required connection\r\n  between the two acts and no further 'connection' must be shown for\r\n  admissibility.&quot;Â  State v. Wallace, Op. No. 26703 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 17, 2009)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37, at 18, 22-23).Â  \r\nSome\r\n  jurisdictions lower the standard of similarity necessary for admission of\r\n  evidence of &quot;other crimes&quot; when, as here, a defendant is attempting\r\n  to introduce the evidence.Â  See State v. Garfole, 388 A.2d 587,\r\n  591 (N.J. 1978) (stating &quot;a lower standard of degree of similarity of\r\n  offenses may justly be required of a defendant using other-crimes evidence\r\n  defensively than is exacted from the State&quot;); see also United\r\n    States v. Stevens, 935 F.2d 1380, 1403 (3d Cir. 1991) (applying a lower\r\n  standard and quoting Garfole); United States v. Cohen, 888 F.2d\r\n  770, 776 (11th Cir. 1989) (finding standard for admission relaxed when the\r\n  evidence is offered by a defendant).Â  This is sometimes called the &quot;Reverse\r\n  404(b) Rule.&quot;Â  Jessica Broderick, Comment and Casenote, Reverse 404(b)\r\n    Evidence: Exploring Standards When Defendants Want to Introduce Other Bad Acts\r\n    of Third Parties, 79 U.Colo.L.Rev. 587, 587 (2008).Â  Even with a lower\r\n  standard of similarity, the defendant must still show the other crimes are of a\r\n  similar nature.Â  See Rivera v. State, 561 So.2d 536, 539-40 (Fla.\r\n  1990) (recognizing lower standard of admissibility but finding other crimes\r\n  dissimilar enough to determine trial court did not abuse discretion in\r\n  excluding evidence).\r\nThe State charged Sanders with numerous crimes occurring shortly\r\n  after Child's death.Â  Cope proffered the testimony of four of Sanders' victims.Â  Victim 1 testified that on December 12,\r\n  2001, at about 11:30 p.m., Sanders knocked at her apartment door and asked to\r\n  use her telephone.Â  He pushed her door open, knocked her down, got on top of\r\n  her, and kissed her.Â  Sanders then raped her, demanded money, and destroyed her\r\n  telephone.Â  \r\nVictim\r\n  2 testified that on December 16, 2001, Sanders came to her house at about 1:00\r\n  a.m.Â  She had fallen asleep on her couch and when she woke, Sanders was\r\n  standing over her.Â  She did not hear anyone come in the house and her dog did\r\n  not bark.Â  When she screamed, Sanders put his hand over her mouth and pinned\r\n  her under a rocking chair.Â  Sanders ran onto her second-floor patio and jumped\r\n  off when her dog began barking and her daughter called for her.Â  \r\nVictim 3 testified that on\r\n  December 19, 2001, at about 7:30 p.m., she had just come home when Sanders came\r\n  through her front door and attacked her.Â  When she tried to crawl to her room,\r\n  Sanders placed a plastic bag over her head.Â  When she removed the bag, Sanders\r\n  put a rug over her head and as she was trying to remove the rug, Sanders got on\r\n  top of her and tried to remove her pants.Â  She grabbed an ink pen from her\r\n  pocket and stabbed Sanders in the leg.Â  Sanders shoved Victim 3 into one of the\r\n  bedrooms, closed the door, and left.Â  At some point, he asked her for money.Â Â Â  \r\nVictim\r\n  4 testified that on January 12, 2002, at about midnight, she was in her room\r\n  watching a movie when she heard a knock at her door.Â  When Victim 4 opened the\r\n  door, Sanders pushed the door in and shoved her into the bathroom.Â  The fight\r\n  continued in the kitchen where Sanders kicked and pushed Victim 4.Â  Sanders\r\n  also held Victim 4 in a choke hold and tried to get on top of her several times.Â \r\n  While Victim 4 was on the floor, Sanders ran into her room and grabbed her\r\n  purse.Â  As he was trying to leave, Victim 4 grabbed a pan from the stove and\r\n  hit Sanders with it.Â  He dropped the purse and Victim 4 grabbed her Mace.Â  She\r\n  tried to spray him, but missed.Â  She then saw a small screwdriver on the floor\r\n  and swung it at him, hitting him at least once in the shoulder.Â Â Â  \r\nMindful\r\n  of our standard of review, we find no reversible error in the trial court's\r\n  exclusion of this evidence.Â  Although there are some similarities between the\r\n  other crimes and Child's assault, there are also many differences.Â  For\r\n  instance, no other crime resulted in the death of the victim or involved a\r\n  child.Â  None of the proffered crimes included the brutality of the attack on\r\n  Child such as anal penetration and assault with a foreign object.Â  We therefore\r\n  hold Cope has not shown a close degree of similarity between the other bad acts\r\n  and the charged offenses, much less any logical relation between the assault on\r\n  and murder of Child and the other incidents in the vicinity allegedly involving\r\n  Sanders and other victims.Â  Based on these holdings, we affirm the trial court's\r\n  ruling that Sanders' other crimes are dissimilar to these facts and are\r\n  therefore inadmissible under Lyle and Rule 404(b), even if reviewed\r\n  under a lower standard because proffered by a defendant, to show either\r\n  identity or the existence of a common scheme.\r\n\r\nB. Testimony of James Hill\r\nCope argues the trial court erred in excluding\r\n  testimony from James Hill.Â  We disagree.\r\nEvidence is\r\n  relevant if it tends to make the existence of any fact of consequence to the\r\n  determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the\r\n  evidence.Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  All relevant evidence is admissible.Â  State v. Douglas,\r\n  369 S.C. 424, 429-30, 632 S.E.2d 845, 848 (2006).Â  Relevant evidence may be\r\n  excluded if the prejudicial effect of its admission substantially outweighs the\r\n  probative value of the evidence.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The trial court has broad\r\n  discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and its decision to admit\r\n  or exclude evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion and a showing of prejudice.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545,\r\n  557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â  \r\nCope\r\n  proffered the testimony of James Hill, who is serving a sentence for burglary.Â \r\n  Hill testified he was in his cell in a segregation unit in prison near the end\r\n  of 2002.Â  Hill recognized Sanders' distinctive voice and overheard Sanders and\r\n  another inmate laughing about how easy it was to get away with crimes.Â  Sanders\r\n  allegedly stated he was &quot;going to get away with what he did to that little\r\n  girl in Rock Hill.&quot;Â  Sanders allegedly &quot;went on to explicitly\r\n  describe what he had done.&quot;Â  Sanders remarked about oral and anal sodomy\r\n  and smothering the child.Â  Finally, Sanders &quot;alluded to the fact that he\r\n  had got in through a window in the house and that he had left through the same\r\n  window.&quot;Â  Sanders objected to the evidence as irrelevant.Â  The court\r\n  excluded the evidence as irrelevant because there were no identifying\r\n  characteristics, noting the testimony did not specify time, place, or other\r\n  circumstances.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  again look to our standard of review and determine the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in excluding Hill's testimony.Â  See State v.\r\n    Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 380, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991) (reiterating the\r\n  standard of review of a trial judge's ruling on questions concerning the\r\n  relevancy of evidence and looking for guidance to other jurisdictions that have\r\n  addressed the particular issue concerning relevancy); State v. Larsen,\r\n  415 P.2d 685, 692 (Idaho 1966) (noting the potential of abuse from ruling\r\n  &quot;that a bare, out-of-court confession is . . . admissible&quot; and\r\n  holding &quot;that third-party confessions, made out of court, are admissible\r\n  only when there is other substantial evidence which tends to show clearly that\r\n  the declarant is in fact the person guilty of the crime for which the accused\r\n  is on trial&quot;); People v. Cruz, 643 N.E.2d 636, 650 (1994) (reciting\r\n  the rule that &quot;[a]n extrajudicial declaration not under oath, by the\r\n  declarant, that he, and not the defendant on trial, committed the crime is\r\n  inadmissible as hearsay, though the declaration is against the declarant's\r\n  penal interest,&quot; but allowing an exception &quot;where there are\r\n  sufficient indicia of trustworthiness of such extrajudicial statements&quot;).\r\nC.Â \r\n  Admission of &quot;False Confessions&quot; Expert Testimony\r\nCope\r\n  argues the trial court erred in excluding testimony of his false confession\r\n  expert about two cases of coerced internalized false confessions.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admissibility of an expert's testimony is a matter within the trial court's\r\n  sound discretion.Â  State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 507, 626 S.E.2d 59,\r\n  63 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The trial court's decision to admit expert testimony will\r\n  not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 507,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 64.Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based\r\n  on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.&quot;Â  Id.Â  To warrant reversal, any error by the trial court in admitting or\r\n  excluding expert testimony must result in prejudice.Â  Id. at 508, 626\r\n  S.E.2d at 64.\r\nRule 702 of the\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of testimony by\r\n  experts, providing:\r\n\r\n  If\r\n    scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\r\n    fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness\r\n    qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\r\n    may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\r\n\r\nRule 702, SCRE.Â  \r\nThe precise issue\r\n  of prohibiting an expert from relating case studies to the jury was raised in State\r\n    v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488 (2004).Â  In Myers, the expert[5] was qualified as an expert in social psychology and testified about the\r\n  psychology of confessions and false or coerced confessions.Â  Id. at 50,\r\n  596 S.E.2d at 493.Â  The trial court in Myers prohibited the expert from\r\n  testifying about the facts of particular cases from Connecticut and Indiana in\r\n  which people falsely confessed to crimes and were later exonerated.Â  Id.Â  In affirming the trial court, our supreme court found the expert related some\r\n  facts about the specific cases but did not use names.Â  Id. at 51, 596\r\n  S.E.2d at 494.Â  Furthermore, the court found no prejudice in part because the\r\n  expert &quot;was able to testify at length about false and coerced confessions.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the court found any error in excluding specific case\r\n  studies from the expert's testimony was harmless as the evidence was merely\r\n  cumulative to the expert's other testimony.Â  Id.\r\nThis\r\n  issue was also addressed in State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d\r\n  144 (2007).Â  In Pittman, the trial court allowed the defendant to\r\n  present &quot;a copious amount&quot; of evidence regarding the antidepressant\r\n  drugs Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).Â  373 S.C. at 578, 647\r\n  S.E.2d at 170-71.Â  The defendant was permitted to introduce evidence that SSRIs\r\n  could cause mania and other conditions, and to present anecdotal testimony\r\n  regarding the antidepressant Paxil by a user of Paxil.Â  Id.Â  The trial\r\n  court excluded anecdotal evidence regarding the antidepressant Zoloft.[6]Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  affirming the trial court, our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n  [T]he court was concerned about the reliability of the anecdotal\r\n    reports compared with the reliability of reports from clinical studies done in\r\n    a controlled environment. The court was also concerned with the trustworthiness\r\n    of the sources of the anecdotal testimony, as well as the ability of experts to establish the causal link between the Zoloft and the\r\n    incidents. Despite these concerns, the trial court permitted the above expert testimony regarding Zoloft obtained from reliable methods,\r\n    consistent with the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.\r\n  The record shows a conscientious decision on the part of\r\n    the trial court to not admit evidence with questionable reliability where there\r\n    was an abundance of other admissible evidence found to be reliable.\r\n    Additionally, the trial court correctly found that the prejudicial effects\r\n    outweighed the probative value of the anecdotal evidence.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Cope presented an expert, Dr. Saul Kassin, who testified regarding\r\n  false confessions.Â  Dr. Kassin testified as to the interrogation techniques\r\n  used by the police in obtaining false confessions and the techniques used in\r\n  this case: (1) false evidence â€“ the officers telling Cope he failed the\r\n  polygraph; (2) positive confrontation â€“ the officers claiming they knew Cope\r\n  did it; (3) the officers' refusals to accept Cope's denials of guilt even\r\n  though he agreed to a polygraph and waived an attorney; (4) minimization â€“ the\r\n  officers suggesting the crime was accidental; and (5) interrogation while Cope\r\n  was traumatized and tired.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Kassin proffered testimony about Peter Reilly, who falsely confessed to\r\n  murdering and sexually assaulting his mother, and Gary Gauger, who falsely\r\n  confessed to murdering his parents.Â  In both of these cases, the defendants\r\n  denied involvement, were administered polygraphs and told they failed, believed\r\n  they must have somehow committed the crimes, and confessed.Â  The trial court\r\n  refused to allow Dr. Kassin to testify regarding specific cases of false\r\n  confession unless they were &quot;on all fours&quot; with this case and\r\n  ultimately refused to allow the testimony.Â  The trial court in this case\r\n  conscientiously considered the proffered anecdotal evidence before excluding\r\n  this testimony.Â  The theories underlying the study of coerced internalized\r\n  false confessions were exhaustively presented to the jury.Â  Dr. Kassin\r\n  explained the techniques used by interrogators that can lead to false\r\n  confessions and informed the jury that there were &quot;innumerable actual\r\n  cases&quot; of coerced internalized false confessions. Â Therefore, we find the\r\n  exclusion of the testimony regarding the specific details of the Reilly and\r\n  Gauger cases does not constitute reversible error.Â  \r\nD.Â \r\n  Admissibility of Cope's Statements\r\nCope\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements\r\n  because he was arrested without probable cause.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The fundamental question in determining the lawfulness of an\r\n  arrest is whether probable cause existed to make the arrest.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 49, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  &quot;Probable cause\r\n  for a warrantless arrest exists when the circumstances within the arresting\r\n  officer's knowledge are sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that\r\n  a crime has been committed by the person being arrested.&quot;Â  Id.Â  A magistrate's determination of probable cause should be paid great deference\r\n  by the reviewing court.Â  State v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 617, 230\r\n  S.E.2d 621, 624 (1976) (reviewing magistrate's finding of probable cause to\r\n  issue search warrant).\r\nWhether probable cause exists depends upon the totality of the circumstances.Â  State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 509, 476 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1996) (finding\r\n  probable cause for warrantless arrest).Â  In assessing probable cause, the court\r\n  looks to whether the facts and circumstances are sufficient for a reasonable\r\n  person to believe that a crime has been committed by the person to be\r\n  arrested.Â  Id.Â  \r\nJudge McNeely testified she issued the warrant based on the fact\r\n  that Cope was the only adult home at the time of the murder and there was a\r\n  lack of evidence of forced entry.Â  Based on the totality of the\r\n  circumstances, we agree with the trial court there was probable cause to arrest\r\n  Cope.[7] Â Â \r\nCope\r\n  next argues the statements he made after the bond hearing on December 1st\r\n  should have been suppressed because he applied for and was found eligible for\r\n  representation by a public defender.[8]Â  \r\nIn State v. Council, our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n  The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches when adversarial\r\n    judicial proceedings have been initiated and at all critical stages.Â  The Sixth\r\n    Amendment right attaches only &quot;post-indictment,&quot; at least in the\r\n    questioning/statement setting.Â  When the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has\r\n    attached, if police initiate interrogation after a defendant's assertion, at an\r\n    arraignment or other similar proceedings, of his right to counsel,\r\n    any waiver of the defendant's right to counsel for that police initiated\r\n    interrogation is invalid unless the defendant initiates the contact himself.\r\n\r\n335 S.C. 1,\r\n  15-16, 515 S.E.2d 508, 515 (1999) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Furthermore, a waiver is knowingly and intelligently made where a\r\n  defendant waives his right to counsel after having been apprised of his Miranda rights.Â  State v. Howard, 296 S.C. 481, 494, 374 S.E.2d 284, 291 (1988)\r\n  (citing Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U.S. 285, 296-97 (1988)).Â  \r\nCope\r\n  argues the bond hearing triggered his right to counsel.Â  We need not determine\r\n  if the bond hearing triggered Cope's right to counsel because we find Cope\r\n  waived his right to counsel prior to making his second and third statements.[9]Â  Cope was charged with murder\r\n  in the early morning hours of November 30th.Â  At approximately 9:00 a.m., Cope was served with the child neglect\r\n  warrants and then taken to the polygraph examination where he was read his Miranda warnings.Â  Between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m., Cope was\r\n  transported to the Moss Justice Center for his polygraph examination.Â  Baker\r\n  read Cope his Miranda warnings and Cope voluntarily waived his\r\n  constitutional rights.Â  The polygraph examination began at 11:15 a.m.Â  After\r\n  the examination, Baker informed Cope he had failed.Â  Lieutenant Herring and\r\n  Baker continued questioning Cope. Â Cope gave his first confession at 2:25 p.m. Â \r\nÂ  On Sunday, December 2, Cope told the Rock\r\n  Hill police he wanted to talk to the investigating officers again.Â  Officer\r\n  Herring told the Rock Hill dispatcher to inform Cope they would speak to him\r\n  the following day.Â  On December 3, Cope made his second and third confessions\r\n  and the video reenactment. \r\nWe find\r\n  Cope knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel by initiating the\r\n  contact with the investigating officers prior to his second and third\r\n  confessions and after receiving Miranda warnings.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  no error by the trial court in denying Cope's motion to suppress his confessions.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  SEVERANCE\r\nCope argues the trial court erred in denying his\r\n  motion for severance.Â  Cope complains the evidence of Sanders' other crimes\r\n  could be admitted as evidence of third-party guilt in a separate trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA\r\n  motion for a severance and separate trial is addressed to the sound discretion\r\n  of the trial judge and the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a\r\n  showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 122,\r\n  481 S.E.2d 118, 124 (1997).Â  A defendant who alleges he was improperly tried\r\n  jointly must show prejudice before the appellate court will reverse his\r\n  conviction.Â  State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 281-83, 523 S.E.2d 173,\r\n  176&nbsp;(1999).\r\nCriminal\r\n  defendants who are jointly tried for murder are not entitled to separate trials\r\n  as a matter of right.Â  Id.; State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 73, 502\r\n  S.E.2d 63, 75 (1998).Â  This is true even when a defendant's severance motion is based upon the likelihood he and a codefendant will present mutually\r\n  antagonistic defenses such as accusing each other of committing the crime.Â  State\r\n    v. Leonard, 287 S.C. 462, 473, 339 S.E.2d 159, 165 (Ct. App. 1986), reversed\r\n      on other grounds, 292 S.C. 133, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987). \r\nAdmissibility\r\n  of evidence under the third-party guilt doctrine is governed by the rule in State\r\n    v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941).Â  The rule states: \r\n\r\n  [E]vidence\r\n    offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another person must be\r\n    limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt,\r\n    and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own\r\n    innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare\r\n    suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the\r\n    commission of the crime by another, is not admissible . . . [B]efore such\r\n    testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such\r\n    a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other\r\n    person as the guilty party.\r\n\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d at\r\n  534-35 (internal citations omitted).Â  Evidence of third-party guilt may include:\r\n  (1) facts that are inconsistent with the defendant's guilt; and (2) evidence\r\n  raising a reasonable inference as to the accused's innocence.Â  State v. Rice,\r\n  375 S.C. at 317, 652 S.E.2d at 416.Â  See also Holmes v. South\r\n    Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 331 (2006) (holding that to prohibit, on the\r\n  strength of the prosecution's case, evidence of third-party guilt proffered by\r\n  an accused violated the right of the accused to present a complete defense).\r\nCope sought to\r\n  introduce evidence of Sanders' other crimes in a separate trial to prove\r\n  Sanders' guilt and his ability to enter victims' homes without signs of forced\r\n  entry.Â  The jury in this case was aware Sanders was involved in Child's murder\r\n  due to the presence of his DNA.Â  The jury was made aware of evidence that the\r\n  Cope house could have been entered without signs of forced entry as Cope\r\n  presented testimony from a locksmith that the lock could have been picked or a\r\n  credit card could have opened the door lock without leaving signs of forced\r\n  entry.Â  The evidence of Cope's involvement, such as his confessions and the\r\n  evidence of the lack of forced entry, would still have been admitted in a\r\n  separate trial.Â  We find the introduction of the evidence of Sanders' other\r\n  crimes would not have been inconsistent with Cope's guilt, even if offered in a\r\n  separate trial, and would not have raised an inference as to Cope's innocence.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error by the trial court in denying Cope's motion for\r\n  severance.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  CONSPIRACY\r\nCope\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict on the conspiracy\r\n  charge based on the lack of evidence supporting an agreement between Sanders\r\n  and Cope.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence must be\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the State, and if there is any direct\r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\n  the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the case was\r\n  properly submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Kelsey, 331 S.C. at 62, 502\r\n  S.E.2d at 69 (1998).Â  &quot;In ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the\r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â  In addressing the standard of review where the State relies\r\n  exclusively on circumstantial evidence and a motion for directed verdict is\r\n  made, our supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    circuit court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its\r\n    weight.Â  The circuit court should not refuse to grant the directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a\r\n    suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  'Suspicion' implies a belief or\r\n      opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to\r\n      proof.Â  However, a trial judge is not required to find that the\r\n        evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.\r\n\r\nState v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004)\r\n  (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nCriminal conspiracy\r\n  is defined as &quot;a combination between two or more Â Â persons for the purpose\r\n  of accomplishing an unlawful object or a lawful object by unlawful means.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003).Â  &quot;The essence of a conspiracy is the\r\n  agreement.&quot;Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402,\r\n  405 (2001).Â  &quot;Often proof of conspiracy is necessarily by circumstantial\r\n  evidence alone.&quot;Â  State v. Miller, 223 S.C. 128, 133, 74 S.E.2d\r\n  582, 585 (1953).Â  Nevertheless, &quot;the law calls for an objective, rather\r\n  than subjective, test in determining the existence of a conspiracy.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Crocker, 366 S.C. 394, 406, 621 S.E.2d 890, 897 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  Moreover, in viewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a charge of\r\n  conspiracy, an appellate court &quot;must exercise caution to ensure the proof\r\n  is not obtained 'by piling inference upon inference.' &quot; State v. Gunn,\r\n  313 S.C. 124, 134, 437 S.E.2d 75, 81 (1993) (quoting Direct Sales Co. v.\r\n    U.S., 319 U.S. 703, 711(1943)).Â  \r\n&quot;The gravamen\r\n  of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement or combination.&quot;Â  Gunn,\r\n  313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80; see also State v. Condrey, 349\r\n  S.C. 184, 193, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating the crime of\r\n  conspiracy &quot;consists of the agreement or mutual understanding&quot;).Â  Recognition\r\n  of this reality, however, does not compromise the standard that a trial court\r\n  must use in deciding a directed verdict motion when the evidence against an\r\n  accused is entirely circumstantial, namely, that the case must be submitted to\r\n  the jury only &quot;if there is substantial circumstantial evidence which\r\n  reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may\r\n  be fairly and logically deduced.&quot;Â  State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386,\r\n  390, 605 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2004).\r\nWe recognize that\r\n  in the present case there was no direct evidence of an agreement between Cope\r\n  and Sanders.Â  The State's evidence of a conspiracy was entirely circumstantial,\r\n  including: Â (1) forensic evidence that the bite mark where Sanders' DNA was found\r\n  was inflicted within the same two-hour time frame as the injuries that Cope\r\n  confessed to inflicting; (2) Sister's testimony that she and Child locked the\r\n  doors before they went to bed and testimony that there was no evidence of\r\n  forced entry; (3) the deduction from the forensic evidence that Sanders was\r\n  present in a secure private home after the residents had retired for the night;\r\n  (4) testimony that the house was full of debris and passage inside,\r\n  particularly at night, would have been difficult for someone not familiar with\r\n  the residence; (5) statements by Cope revealing knowledge about the factors of\r\n  the assault and injuries to Child consistent with forensic evidence; (6)\r\n  evidence that Cope delayed calling the police after he claimed to have fatally strangled\r\n  and choked Child; and (7) evidence that Cope staged the scene to make Child's\r\n  death appear to have been an accident.Â  \r\nNevertheless,\r\n  in the present case, the DNA evidence on Child's body, along with Cope's\r\n  admissions about his interactions with Child shortly before she died, place\r\n  Cope and Sanders together at the time of the assault on Child and her resulting\r\n  death.Â  Likewise, the testimony regarding lack of forced entry and the\r\n  cluttered condition of the home constitute evidence that Sanders, who had no\r\n  known connection with Cope's family, received assistance to navigate his way to\r\n  Child's bedroom. Â Finally, Cope's staging of the crime scene after Child died\r\n  is evidence that a cover-up had begun before Cope called the police to his home\r\n  on the pretext that Child had accidentally strangled herself, notwithstanding\r\n  compelling forensic evidence that Sanders was present and actively\r\n  participating during the same time period in which her death was determined to\r\n  have occurred.Â  Although each of these factors alone may have supported only a\r\n  mere suspicion of a conspiracy between Cope and Sanders, it is our view that\r\n  when considered together, they yield the requisite level of proof of &quot;acts,\r\n  declarations, or specific conduct&quot; by the alleged conspirators to\r\n  withstand a directed verdict motion on this charge.Â  See State v.\r\n    Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 625, 677 S.E.2d 603, 605 (2009) (reversing a\r\n  conviction for trafficking and noting &quot;the State failed to present any\r\n  evidence such as acts, declarations, or specific conduct to support [an]\r\n  inference&quot; that the petitioners had knowledge that drugs were being\r\n  transported).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial court's evidentiary rulings and\r\n  the denial of Cope's motion for severance.Â  We further hold the trial court properly\r\n  declined to direct a verdict of acquittal for Cope on the issue of criminal conspiracy.Â \r\n  Cope's convictions are therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Cope was sentenced as follows: life\r\n  imprisonment for murder (2002-GS-46-3232) and thirty years for criminal sexual\r\n  conduct first degree (2002-GS-46-3234), consecutive to the life sentence.Â  He\r\n  was also sentenced to thirty years for criminal sexual conduct first degree\r\n  (2002-GS-46-3233); five years for conspiracy (2004-GS-46-200); and ten years for\r\n  unlawful conduct toward a child (2004-GS-46-2614), all concurrent with the\r\n  other two convictions.\r\n[2] At the time of Cope's arrest, he weighed 333\r\n  pounds.\r\n[3] The trial court severed the charges of\r\n  unlawful neglect for the two younger children.

Sanders was\r\n  convicted of the murder of the child of co-defendant Billy Wayne Cope (Child\r\n  Cope),[1] two counts of first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, and criminal conspiracy and was sentenced to life imprisonment,\r\n  plus thirty years. Â He appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  January 12, 2002, police responded to a burglary at a house on White Street in Rock Hill.Â  After taking fingerprints, the officer was called to a house\r\n  down the street where a man of a similar description was attacking Victim 4.[2]Â \r\n  On January 12, 2002, at about midnight, Victim 4 was in her room watching a\r\n  movie when she heard a knock at her door.Â  When Victim 4 opened the door,\r\n  Sanders pushed the door in and shoved her into the bathroom.Â  The fight\r\n  continued in the kitchen where Sanders kicked and pushed Victim 4.Â  Sanders\r\n  also held Victim 4 in a choke hold and tried to get on top of her several\r\n  times.Â  While Victim 4 was on the floor, Sanders ran into her room and grabbed\r\n  her purse.Â  As he was trying to leave, Victim 4 grabbed a pan from the stove\r\n  and hit Sanders with it.Â  He dropped the purse and Victim 4 grabbed her Mace.Â \r\n  She tried to spray him, but missed.Â  She then saw a small screwdriver on the\r\n  floor and swung it at him, hitting him at least once in the shoulder.Â  \r\nVictim\r\n  4 had a blood stain on her shirt, which the police took as evidence.Â  When\r\n  officers searched for the suspect, they spotted Sanders crouched between two\r\n  buildings around the corner from Victim 4's house.Â  Sanders' clothes and hair\r\n  matched the description both victims had given and he was bleeding.Â  Police\r\n  were able to match Sanders' prints with the fingerprints taken at the White\r\n  Street house.Â  Sanders submitted to a blood test on January 14, 2002. \r\nIn\r\n  September 2002, SLED tested bodily fluids it recovered during its investigation\r\n  of the murder of Child Cope and found Sanders' DNA matched semen and saliva\r\n  found on the victim's body.Â  As a result of this discovery, Sanders was\r\n  indicted on the charge of murdering Child Cope as well as two counts of\r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and criminal conspiracy.Â  Eventually,\r\n  Sanders and Cope were tried together on all charges arising from the sexual\r\n  assault on and murder of Child Cope.[3]\r\nOn\r\n  June 18, 2004, Sanders filed a motion to suppress the DNA evidence extracted\r\n  from him in January 2002 because it was unlawfully obtained.Â  Conceding the\r\n  blood drawn in January 2002 was invalidly obtained, the State moved on August\r\n  3, 2004, to have more blood drawn from Sanders.[4]Â \r\n  Sanders argued the second blood draw was fruit of the poisonous tree of the\r\n  first draw.Â  Judge Alford determined all the Snyder[5] factors were present: (1) probable cause existed to believe Sanders committed\r\n  the crime of first degree burglary; (2) there was a clear indication that\r\n  relevant material evidence would be found; (3) the method used to secure\r\n  Sanders' blood sample was safe and reliable; and (4) the crime of first degree\r\n  burglary is serious and the evidence to be collected from Sanders would be\r\n  important to the investigation.Â  On August 4, 2004, Judge Alford ordered\r\n  Sanders to submit to a second blood test.Â  Sanders' blood was drawn again on\r\n  August 5, 2004.Â  The trial court in this case denied Sanders' motion to\r\n  suppress the DNA evidence based on Judge Alford's analysis under Snyder.\r\nThe jury convicted Sanders.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  DNA Sample\r\nSanders\r\n  argues the trial court erred in admitting the DNA evidence because the first\r\n  blood draw was invalid and the evidence from the subsequent blood draw, after\r\n  the August 2004 hearing in the Victim 4 case, should therefore have been\r\n  suppressed.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State v. Brockman, 339 S.C.\r\n  57, 528 S.E.2d 661 (2000), our supreme court\r\n  articulated the standard of review to apply to a trial court's determination\r\n  that a search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Â  The Brockman court\r\n  rejected the de novo standard set forth in Ornelas v. United States, 517\r\n  U.S. 690 (1996), for reviewing determinations of reasonable suspicion and\r\n  probable cause in the context of warrantless searches and seizures and reviewed\r\n  the &quot;trial court's ruling like any other factual finding.&quot;Â  Brockman,\r\n  339 S.C. at 66, 528 S.E.2d at 666.Â  Therefore, an appellate court may reverse a\r\n  trial court's ruling only upon a showing of clear error and must affirm if\r\n  there is any evidence to support the ruling.Â  See State v.\r\n    Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 597, 571 S.E.2d 703, 706 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const. Amend. IV.Â  A court order that allows the government to procure evidence from a\r\n  person's body constitutes a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment.Â  Schmerber\r\n    v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 767-70 (1966).Â  &quot;[T]he Fourth Amendment's\r\n  proper function is to constrain, not against all intrusions as such, but\r\n  against intrusions which are not justified in the circumstances, or which are\r\n  made in an improper manner.&quot; Â Id. at 768.Â  &quot;In other words,\r\n  the questions we must decide . . . are whether the police were justified in\r\n  requiring petitioner to submit to the blood test, and whether the means and\r\n  procedures employed in taking his blood respected relevant Fourth Amendment\r\n  standards of reasonableness.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn In\r\n  re Snyder, our supreme court set forth the considerations for a warrant or\r\n  order compelling a bodily intrusion.Â  308 S.C. 192, 195, 417 S.E.2d 572, 574&nbsp;(1992).Â \r\n  The elements to determine whether probable cause exists to permit the\r\n  acquisition of such evidence are: (1) probable cause to believe the suspect has\r\n  committed the crime; (2) a clear indication that relevant material evidence\r\n  will be found; and (3) the method used to secure the evidence is safe and reliable.Â  Id.Â  The court also approved consideration of the seriousness of the\r\n  crime and the importance of the evidence to the investigation.Â  Id.Â  The trial court, in issuing such an order, must &quot;balance the necessity for\r\n  acquiring involuntary nontestimonial identification evidence against\r\n  constitutional safeguards prohibiting unreasonable bodily intrusions, searches,\r\n  and seizures.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nWe find no error in\r\n  the trial court's review of probable cause under the Snyder factors in\r\n  the Victim 4 case.Â  Victim 4's shirt contained blood from the attack, Sanders\r\n  was found nearby, his appearance matched Victim 4's description, and Sanders\r\n  was injured when found.Â Â Â  \r\nSanders\r\n  also argues the trial court erred in permitting the DNA obtained in the Victim\r\n  4 case to be used in this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  blood sample validly obtained in connection with one crime may be used in a\r\n  subsequent unrelated case.Â  See State v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477,\r\n  484, 562 S.E.2d 689, 693 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding no improper search or seizure\r\n  where defendant's blood, voluntarily submitted in an unrelated case, is used in\r\n  a subsequent case); see also Washington\r\n    v. State, 653 So.2d 362, 364\r\n  (Fla. 1994) (&quot;[O]nce the samples were validly obtained, albeit in an\r\n  unrelated case, the police were not restrained from using the samples as\r\n  evidence in the murder case.&quot;); Bickley v. State, 489 S.E.2d 167,\r\n  169 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997) (holding the DNA evidence should not be &quot;suppressed\r\n  on the basis that additional testing of defendant's blood . . . required an independent\r\n  warrant&quot;); Patterson v. State, 744 N.E.2d 945, 947 (Ind. Ct.

Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004) (boldface\r\n  material in original) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nCriminal conspiracy\r\n  is defined as &quot;a combination between two or more Â Â persons for the purpose\r\n  of accomplishing an unlawful object or a lawful object by unlawful means.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003).Â  &quot;The essence of a conspiracy is the\r\n  agreement.&quot;Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402,\r\n  405 (2001).Â  &quot;Often proof of conspiracy is necessarily by circumstantial\r\n  evidence alone.&quot;Â  State v. Miller, 223 S.C. 128, 133, 74 S.E.2d\r\n  582, 585 (1953).Â  Nevertheless, &quot;the law calls for an objective, rather\r\n  than subjective, test in determining the existence of a conspiracy.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Crocker, 366 S.C. 394, 406, 621 S.E.2d 890, 897 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  Moreover, in viewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a charge of\r\n  conspiracy, an appellate court &quot;must exercise caution to ensure the proof\r\n  is not obtained 'by piling inference upon inference.' &quot;Â  State v. Gunn,\r\n  313 S.C. 124, 134, 437 S.E.2d 75, 81 (1993) (quoting Direct Sales Co. v.\r\n    U.S., 319 U.S. 703, 711(1943)).Â  \r\n&quot;The gravamen\r\n  of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement or combination.&quot;Â  Gunn,\r\n  313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80; see also State v. Condrey, 349\r\n  S.C. 184, 193, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating the crime of\r\n  conspiracy &quot;consists of the agreement or mutual understanding&quot;).Â \r\n  Recognition of this reality, however, does not compromise the standard that a\r\n  trial court must use in deciding a directed verdict motion when the evidence\r\n  against an accused is entirely circumstantial, namely, that the case must be\r\n  submitted to the jury only &quot;if there is substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which\r\n  his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.&quot;Â  State v. Arnold,\r\n  361 S.C. 386, 390, 605 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2004).\r\nWe recognize that\r\n  in the present case there was no direct evidence of an agreement between Cope\r\n  and Sanders.Â  The State's evidence of a conspiracy was entirely circumstantial,\r\n  including:Â  (1) forensic evidence that the bite mark where Sanders' DNA was\r\n  found was inflicted within the same two-hour time frame as the injuries that\r\n  Cope confessed to inflicting; (2) Sister's testimony that she and Child locked\r\n  the doors before they went to bed and testimony that there was no evidence of\r\n  forced entry; (3) the deduction from the forensic evidence that Sanders was\r\n  present in a secure private home after the residents had retired for the night;\r\n  (4) testimony that the house was full of debris and therefore passage inside,\r\n  particularly at night, would have been difficult for someone not familiar with\r\n  the residence; (5) statements by Cope revealing knowledge about the factors of\r\n  the assault and injuries to Child consistent with forensic evidence; (6)\r\n  evidence that Cope delayed calling the police after he claimed to have fatally\r\n  strangled and choked Child; and (7) evidence that Cope staged the scene to make\r\n  Child's death appear to have been an accident.Â  \r\nNevertheless,\r\n  in the present case, the DNA evidence on Child's body, along with Cope's admissions\r\n  about his interactions with Child shortly before she died, place Cope and\r\n  Sanders together at the time of the assault on Child and her resulting death.Â \r\n  Likewise, the testimony regarding lack of forced entry and the cluttered\r\n  condition of the home constitute evidence that Sanders, who had no known\r\n  connection with Cope's family, received assistance to navigate his way to\r\n  Child's bedroom.Â  Finally, Cope's staging of the crime scene after Child died\r\n  is evidence that a cover-up had begun before Cope called the police to his home\r\n  on the pretext that Child had accidentally strangled herself, notwithstanding\r\n  forensic evidence revealing Sanders was present and actively participating\r\n  during the same time period in which her death was found to have occurred.Â  Although\r\n  each of these factors alone may have supported only a mere suspicion of a\r\n  conspiracy between Cope and Sanders, it is our view that when considered\r\n  together, they yield the requisite level of proof of &quot;acts, declarations,\r\n  or specific conduct&quot; by the alleged conspirators to withstand a directed\r\n  verdict motion on this charge.Â  See State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620,\r\n  625, 677 S.E.2d 603, 605 (2009) (reversing a conviction for trafficking and\r\n  noting &quot;the State failed to present any evidence such as acts, declarations,\r\n  or specific conduct to support [an] inference&quot; that the petitioners had\r\n  knowledge that drugs were being transported).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial court's evidentiary rulings and\r\n  uphold the trial court's denial of a directed verdict on the conspiracy charge.\r\n  Â As a result, the sentences of life imprisonment for murder, plus thirty years\r\n  for criminal sexual conduct, are also affirmed.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See State v.

Judy (Ronnie) appeals from the jury's verdict against him, arguing\r\n  the circuit court erred in declining to dismiss the suit against him on the\r\n  basis of laches, collateral estoppel, or res judicata, and in declining to\r\n  permit him to amend his answer to include a defense of waiver.Â  We affirm in\r\n  part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1983, Vesta Rumph (Mrs. Rumph) died, leaving three parcels of\r\n  real property to be distributed equally between brothers Ronnie and James T.\r\n  Judy (James).[1]Â  The three parcels included a 10.9-acre\r\n  tract (10.9-acre Tract), a 9.29-acre tract on which stood the family homestead\r\n  (Homestead Tract), and a 134.71-acre tract which included an eleven-acre\r\n  manmade pond (Pond Tract).Â  The property was not formally distributed between\r\n  the men for many years.Â  Pursuant to an oral agreement between the men, Ronnie\r\n  took possession of the Homestead Tract and lived in the Rumph homestead, and\r\n  James took possession of the other two tracts.Â  From July 1983 until October\r\n  15, 2001, Ronnie served as personal representative of Mrs. Rumph's estate\r\n  (Estate).Â  In 1999, Ronnie deeded his\r\n  half-interest in the tracts to J. Todd Judy.Â  Â Â \r\nOn February 8, 2001, James filed suit in probate court seeking\r\n  partition of the Estate's property.Â  On February 12, 2001, Ronnie executed a\r\n  Deed of Distribution in his capacity as personal representative of the Estate\r\n  granting ownership of the three tracts to himself and James as the heirs.Â \r\n  However, because Ronnie disclaimed any interest in the property based on his\r\n  1999 transfer of his interest, he was dismissed from the suit in his personal\r\n  capacity.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nIn August 2001, on behalf of the Estate, Ronnie executed and\r\n  recorded a deed purporting to convey full ownership of all three tracts to J.\r\n  Todd Judy and Ryan C. Judy.Â  Subsequently, James petitioned to have Ronnie\r\n  removed as personal representative of the Estate.Â  Ronnie was served with\r\n  notice this petition would be heard on October 9, 2001.Â  The day before this\r\n  hearing, Ronnie executed an agreement on behalf of the Estate leasing twenty-five\r\n  acres of the Pond Tract to a third party for fishing purposes for a period of\r\n  ten years.Â  On October 15, 2001, the probate court removed Ronnie as personal\r\n  representative of the Estate and appointed James in his place.Â Â Â  \r\nIn November 2001, J. Todd Judy and Ryan C. Judy recorded a deed\r\n  purporting to convey title to the Homestead Tract to Wanda Judy.Â  Later, James\r\n  petitioned on behalf of the Estate to recover the property Ronnie had conveyed,\r\n  including the Homestead Tract.Â  The probate court found Ronnie's August 2001\r\n  deed was invalid, the subsequent conveyance to Wanda Judy was void, and the\r\n  Estate owned all three tracts.Â  Later, the probate court found the Estate\r\n  validly conveyed ownership of the three tracts equally to Ronnie and James\r\n  through the February 12, 2001, deed of distribution, and therefore, both men's\r\n  signatures were required for a valid sale of the property.Â  \r\nIn May 2003, someone operating a backhoe damaged the earthen dam\r\n  supporting the eleven-acre manmade pond on the Pond Tract, and the pond drained\r\n  completely.Â  In November 2003, James again petitioned the probate court to\r\n  partition the property and also to void the October 2001 fishing lease.Â  On\r\n  January 7, 2004, the probate court granted the relief sought, awarding\r\n  ownership of the Pond Tract to James and the 10.9-acre and Homestead Tracts to\r\n  Ronnie.Â  In December 2005, James sold the Pond Tract for $1.28 million.Â Â Â  \r\nIn November 2005, James filed a circuit court suit sounding in\r\n  tort against Ronnie for the loss of the pond.Â  Ronnie represented himself until\r\n  near the eve of trial, when he finally retained counsel.Â  Just before trial, Ronnie moved to dismiss for lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction, arguing James's suit was barred by laches,\r\n  collateral estoppel, and res judicata, and moved to amend his answer to add the\r\n  defense of waiver.Â  The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss as to\r\n  collateral estoppel and res judicata.Â  The case proceeded to trial.Â  Following\r\n  presentation of the evidence, the circuit court permitted amendment of the\r\n  answer to include laches but immediately found no evidence existed to support\r\n  that defense.Â  The circuit court also permitted amendment of the answer to\r\n  include waiver.Â  However, after argument, the circuit court declined to charge\r\n  the jury on waiver.Â  The jury returned a verdict in James's favor.Â  The circuit court denied Ronnie's post-trial motions\r\n  for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action in tort for damages is an action\r\n  at law.Â  Longshore v. Saber Sec. Servs., Inc., 365\r\n  S.C. 554, 560, 619 S.E.2d 5, 9&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  In an action at law, on\r\n  appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of the appellate court\r\n  extends merely to the correction of errors of law.Â  Erickson v. Jones Street\r\n    Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 464, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663-64&nbsp;(2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRonnie argues the circuit court erred in refusing to dismiss James's suit for waste on the bases\r\n  of collateral estoppel, laches, and res judicata.Â  We disagree as to collateral\r\n  estoppel and laches.Â  However, we agree as to res judicata.Â  \r\nI. Collateral\r\n  Estoppel and Laches\r\nCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prohibits a court from\r\n  adjudicating an issue that was &quot;actually litigated and determined by a\r\n  valid and final judgment&quot; in a prior suit.Â  Zurcher v. Bilton, 379\r\n  S.C. 132, 135, 666 S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008).Â  Collateral estoppel applies to\r\n  specific issues, regardless of whether the claims in the first and subsequent\r\n  suits are the same.Â  Id.Â  It applies only if &quot;the precluded party\r\n  has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his\r\n  rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his\r\n  adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise\r\n  detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to\r\n  enforce those rights.&quot;Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for\r\n    Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993).Â  In determining\r\n  whether laches bars a claim, the court has broad discretion and should consider\r\n  the circumstances of the case, &quot;including whether the delay has worked\r\n  injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other party.&quot;Â  Id., 434\r\n  S.E.2d at 281.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to dismiss James's suit\r\n  for waste on the basis of collateral estoppel or laches.Â  Collateral estoppel\r\n  is inapplicable because the probate court did not adjudicate the issue of fault\r\n  for destruction of the dam.Â  See Zurcher, 379\r\n  S.C. at 135, 666 S.E.2d at 226.Â  In addition, the circuit court's refusal to dismiss the waste suit on the basis of\r\n  laches was within its broad discretion.Â  James clearly knew during the pendency\r\n  of the partition suit that the destruction of the dam and pond diminished the\r\n  value of the Pond Tract.Â  No evidence indicates in the nearly three years\r\n  between the probate court's decision and the filing of the circuit court suit\r\n  Ronnie detrimentally changed his position in reliance on James's decision not\r\n  to pursue a claim for this loss in value.Â  Ronnie testified he intended to\r\n  appeal the probate court's order but lost his right to do so because his\r\n  attorney delayed in filing a notice of appeal.Â  The record does not reflect\r\n  Ronnie would have demanded a determination of lost value had he known James\r\n  would pursue this claim in a separate suit.Â  To the contrary, Ronnie testified\r\n  that, had the probate court determined he was responsible for the diminution in\r\n  the Pond Tract's value, he &quot;would have had to go to the bank and borrow\r\n  money and walk off from the place.&quot;Â  Adjudication of this claim by a\r\n  different court in an entirely separate suit certainly is not judicially\r\n  economical when the probate court could have disposed of it in the context of\r\n  the partition suit.Â  However, a tax on the judiciary does not equate to a\r\n  detrimental change in position by a party.Â  Accordingly, neither collateral\r\n  estoppel nor laches bars James's suit for waste.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nII. Res\r\n  Judicata\r\nWhen claims arising out of a particular transaction or occurrence\r\n  are adjudicated, res judicata bars the parties to that suit from bringing\r\n  subsequent actions on either the adjudicated issues or any issues that might\r\n  have been raised in the first suit.Â  Plott v. Justin Ent., 374 S.C. 504,\r\n  511, 649 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Res judicata requires proof of three\r\n  elements:Â  1) a final, valid judgment was entered on the merits of the first\r\n  suit; 2) the parties to both suits are the same; and 3) the subsequent action\r\n  involves matters properly included in the first action.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]he rule precluding relitigation of issues which might have been\r\n    raised in the prior action applies only where the two actions involve the same\r\n    cause of action; but all questions which were actually litigated in the prior\r\n    action and determined by the judgment are conclusive in any subsequent action\r\n    between the parties, or their privies, regardless of whether the subsequent action involves\r\n    the same or a different cause of action.\r\n\r\nLowe v.\r\n  Clayton, 264 S.C. 75, 82,\r\n  212 S.E.2d 582, 585-86 (1975).Â  \r\nWhether\r\n    res judicata precludes a claim because the first and subsequent suits involve\r\n    the same cause of action is not merely a matter of aligning identical causes of\r\n    action or theories of liability; rather, the subject matter of the two suits\r\n    must be the same.Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30,\r\n    35, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999).Â  &quot;The test utilized by this court for\r\n    comparing two causes of action is to determine whether the primary right and\r\n    duty and the delict or wrong are the same in both actions.&quot;Â  Plum Creek\r\n      Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 328 S.C. 347, 350, 491 S.E.2d 692, 694 (Ct.\r\n    App. 1997), aff'd as modified, 334 S.C. 30, 512 S.E.2d 106 (1999); see\r\n      also Nunnery v. Brantley Constr. Co., Inc., 289 S.C. 205, 210, 345\r\n    S.E.2d 740, 743 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\n  South Carolina courts use various tests in determining whether a\r\n    claim should have been raised in a prior suit: 1) when there is identity of the\r\n    subject matter in both cases; 2) where the cases involve the same primary right\r\n    held by the plaintiff and one primary wrong committed by the defendant; 3) when\r\n    there is the same evidence in both cases; and recently 4) when the claims arise\r\n    out of the same transaction or occurrence.\r\n\r\n334 S.C. at 35\r\n  n.3, 512 S.E.2d at 109 n.3 (citing James\r\n  F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 649-650 (2d ed. 1996)).Â  Seeking a\r\n  different remedy in the second suit for the same wrong does not alter the identical nature of the subjects of the two actions.Â  334\r\n  S.C. at 35, 512 S.E.2d at 109.Â  &quot;[F]or purposes of res judicata,\r\n  'cause of action' is not the form of action in which a claim is asserted but,\r\n  rather the 'cause for action, meaning the underlying facts combined with the\r\n  law giving the party a right to a remedy of one form or another based\r\n  thereon.'&quot;Â  Id. at 36, 512 S.E.2d at 109-110 (quoting 50 C.J.S.\r\n  Judgment Â§ 749 (1997)).Â  \r\nThe circuit court erred in declining to dismiss James's suit for\r\n  waste on the basis of res judicata because Ronnie satisfied all three required\r\n  elements.Â  The probate court's final, valid order adjudicating the partition\r\n  suit satisfies the first element.Â  Plott, 374 S.C. at 511, 649 S.E.2d at\r\n  95.Â  Ronnie's and James's participation in the partition suit satisfies the\r\n  second element, identity of the parties\r\n  to both suits.[3]Â  Id.Â  The third element, identity of the\r\n  subject matter of both suits, is also satisfied.Â  Id.; see also Plum\r\n    Creek, 334 S.C. at 35, 512 S.E.2d at 109.Â  Certainly, the remedies sought\r\n  in the partition and waste suits differed considerably, even in the nature of\r\n  the relief sought.Â  The probate court\r\n  heard a petition for equitable relief, partition of jointly owned land.Â  By\r\n  contrast, the circuit court heard a tort suit for waste, a legal action.Â \r\n  However, identity of the subject matter of the two suits rests not in their\r\n  forms of action or the relief sought, but rather, in the combination of the\r\n  facts and law that give rise to a claim for relief.Â  Plum Creek,\r\n  334 S.C. at 36, 512 S.E.2d at 109-110.Â  Partition\r\n  of ownership stripped Ronnie of his rights and duties related to the Pond Tract\r\n  after the pond was lost.Â  The waste suit settled the issue of fault for the\r\n  loss of the pond.Â  James's interest in the Pond Tract suffered when the earthen\r\n  dam on that parcel of land failed under Ronnie's care.Â  Both suits arose from this fact.Â  Consequently, the circuit court erred in finding res\r\n  judicata did not preclude the waste suit.\r\nRonnie\r\n  also argues the circuit court erred in refusing to permit him to amend his\r\n  answer to allege the defense of waiver.Â  We do not reach this issue because our\r\n  ruling on the applicability of res judicata disposes of this appeal.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate\r\n  court need not review remaining issues\r\n  when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs to\r\n  the issue of whether the circuit court erred in denying Ronnie's motion to\r\n  dismiss, we find neither collateral estoppel nor laches bars this action.Â \r\n  Consequently, we affirm the circuit court's refusal to dismiss on those bases.Â \r\n  However, we find res judicata applies.Â  Therefore, we reverse the circuit\r\n  court's refusal to dismiss on the basis of res judicata.Â  Because our reversal\r\n  on the basis of res judicata disposes of this appeal, we do not reach the issue\r\n  of whether the circuit court erred in declining to permit Ronnie to amend his\r\n  answer to allege the defense of waiver.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the\r\n  circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nPIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mrs. Rumph was not related to Ronnie or James.Â  She\r\n  and her husband were friends of the Judys' father.Â  When Mrs. Rumph became\r\n  elderly, Ronnie and James cared for her, and she devised her property to them.Â  \r\n[2] The property was not partitioned as a result of that\r\n  suit.Â  \r\n[3] While the plaintiff in the partition suit was the\r\n  Estate, with James as its personal representative, both men participated in the\r\n  partition suit in their individual capacities and had the opportunity to\r\n  cross-claim against each other.Â  We do not address the differences between\r\n  their roles in the partition and waste suits because neither party argued this\r\n  point.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4529","title":"State v.

White, 382 S.C. 265, 676 S.E.2d 684 (2009).\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  Friday, May 16, 2003, Julie Jett (hereinafter Jett or Victim) failed to appear\r\n  for work.Â  Concerned, Jett's parents contacted Mrs. Mumpower, the property\r\n  manager at Jett's apartment complex, and requested she check on Jett.Â  Mumpower\r\n  knocked several times at Jett's door and then, using a key,[1] opened the door slightly.Â  She saw a great deal of blood on the living room\r\n  floor and immediately closed the door and contacted police.Â  \r\nInvestigators\r\n  arrived at the scene around 5:30 p.m. and initially noticed a large blood stain\r\n  near the television, some spatter in different places in the living room, and\r\n  blood trailing off toward the hallway. Â Police then discovered Jett's nude\r\n  body in the hallway bathroom, kneeling on the floor, doubled over the rim of\r\n  the tub.Â  She had noticeable stab wounds about the face and neck, as well as\r\n  abrasions akin to carpet burns on her knees and face. Â Police collected trace\r\n  evidence and lifted several latent prints from various locations throughout the\r\n  apartment but found none in the bathroom. Â Further examination of the\r\n  doors and windows showed no indication of forced entry. \r\nAn\r\n  autopsy determined Jett's death to be a homicide, occasioned by two\r\n  perforations to the jugular vein, causing excessive blood loss.Â  The autopsy\r\n  revealed &quot;battle signs&quot; including a broken nose and jaw,[2] a black eye, and bruises to both ears. Â The coroner also conducted a &quot;rape\r\n  kit,&quot; and swabs of Victim's vaginal and rectal cavities yielded the\r\n  protein p30, indicating the presence of semen, although no sperm cells were\r\n  recovered. \r\nAuthorities\r\n  conducted DNA testing on the swabs; however, this testing produced only a\r\n  &quot;mixture&quot; or &quot;partial profile&quot; of Jett and another\r\n  individual.[3]Â \r\n  Due to the mixed nature of the profile and the ability of female DNA, in such\r\n  situations, to mask the presence of male DNA, only a minimum number of loci\r\n  could be matched.Â  While these matches did not rule out Tapp, the statistical\r\n  probability of a randomly selected and unrelated individual being the source of\r\n  the evidence was only one in twenty-three.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  order to conduct a more thorough DNA analysis, samples were sent to ReliaGene\r\n  laboratories in New Orleans, Louisiana, for Y-STR testing, which has the\r\n  capability of producing a more accurate DNA profile when there is a mixture of\r\n  male and female DNA present in the sample.Â  The test compared the &quot;male\r\n  extract&quot; from the vaginal swab against the Y-STR profile, which extracts\r\n  only those loci along the Y chromosome unique to men.Â  Tapp's standard sample\r\n  matched the &quot;male extract&quot; from the vaginal swab on all 10 loci that\r\n  the Y-STR test examines.Â  This test could not exclude Tapp, and at the time of\r\n  trial, the statistical probability of a randomly selected and unrelated\r\n  individual being the source of the DNA was one in 17,800 among white males. \r\nPROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nTapp\r\n  filed a motion in limine with the trial court to suppress the DNA\r\n  evidence because the State did not demonstrate that it was going to offer\r\n  evidence that the DNA sample was deposited in Victim during the time frame\r\n  between when she was last seen alive and when her body was discovered.Â  Tapp\r\n  also argued, in limine, to introduce a second statement he made to the\r\n  police, in which he admitted to having had previous sexual encounters with Jett. Â The trial court allowed the DNA testimony but did not allow the\r\n  statement.Â  However, it left open the opportunity for Tapp to testify about his\r\n  prior sexual relationship with Jett.Â  \r\nAmong\r\n  its various expert witnesses, the State qualified Michael Prodan, a special\r\n  agent with the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED), over Tapp's objection, as\r\n  an expert in crime scene analysis and victimology. Â Prodan, through a review of\r\n  crime scene photos, autopsy reports, and other information provided by the\r\n  police and prosecution, developed an opinion as to Victim's particular risk\r\n  level and gave an opinion as to the possible ways in which the altercation\r\n  between Victim and the perpetrator transpired.Â  \r\nSome\r\n  time during the investigation, the State discovered Ryan Wheatley, Jett's\r\n  roommate's boyfriend, may have had a key to the apartment.Â  The State's\r\n  witnesses, Solveig Heintz, and Prodan both testified that Ryan may have had a\r\n  key.Â  Tapp alleges the State withheld this information, and after Prodan\r\n  testified to it, he unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of the State's case, the trial court denied Tapp's motion for a directed\r\n  verdict. Â Tapp offered no evidence in his defense, and the jury convicted him\r\n  on all charges.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL\r\nI.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the fact that the State did not provide evidence to demonstrate the DNA sample\r\n  was deposited in Victim sometime between the time she was last seen alive and\r\n  when her body was discovered render the evidence irrelevant?\r\nII. Did\r\n  the trial court err in qualifying Prodan as an expert witness and allowing his\r\n  testimony?\r\nIII. Did\r\n  the trial court err in denying Tapp's motion for a mistrial because the State\r\n  allegedly withheld exculpatory evidence?\r\nIV. Did\r\n  the trial court err in failing to grant a directed verdict at the close of the\r\n  State's case?Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review\r\n  errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216,\r\n  220&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBecause\r\n  we find it dispositive of the matter at hand, we address only Tapp's allegation\r\n  of error as to the qualification of Prodan as an expert witness.Â  \r\n\tQualification of an Expert Witness\r\nTapp\r\n  first alleges that it was error to qualify Prodan as an expert witness.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nWhen\r\n  this court first heard this case we reversed the trial court and remanded the\r\n  matter for a new trial.Â  Subsequently, we granted the State's petition for\r\n  rehearing to reevaluate our apprehension of the rules of issue preservation.Â \r\n  However, in the interim the South Carolina Supreme Court addressed the issue of\r\n  the qualification of non-scientific expert witnesses in State v. White, 382\r\n  S.C. 265, 676 S.E.2d 684 (2009).Â  In our original opinion, we affirmed the\r\n  qualification of Prodan, relying on very specific language from State v.\r\n    Morgan, which stated in the context of nonscientific expert testimony,\r\n  issues of reliability go to the weight of the evidence, rather than its\r\n  admissibility. Â 326 S.C. 503, 513, 485 S.E.2d 112, 118 (Ct. App. 1997).Â \r\n  However, in State v. White, the South Carolina Supreme Court overruled Morgan and declared this specific proposition an &quot;incorrect statement of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  White, 382 S.C. at 273, 676 S.E.2d at 688.Â  Accordingly, on\r\n  rehearing, we find White necessitates we revisit the issue of Prodan's\r\n  qualification as an expert.[4]\r\nIn White, the appellant was convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping.Â  State\r\n  v. White, 372 S.C. 364, 375, 642 S.E.2d 607, 612 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  White\r\n  appealed, arguing expert dog tracking evidence must satisfy the standard for\r\n  &quot;scientific based&quot; expert testimony under the State v. Jones[5] reliability test.Â  Id. at 375, 642 S.E.2d at 612.Â  This court affirmed\r\n  White's convictions, noting a distinction between scientific testimony and\r\n  nonscientific, or experience based, expert testimony, and held questions about\r\n  the reliability of the evidence in nonscientific areas of expertise go only to\r\n  the weight to be given the testimony and not its admissibility. Â Id.Â \r\n  Our decision in White relied on Morgan for the proposition that\r\n  &quot; '[i]f the expert's opinion does not fall within [the] Jones [standard for scientific expert testimony], questions about the reliability of\r\n  an expert's methods go only to the weight, but not admissibility, of the\r\n  testimony.' &quot; Â Id. at 376, 642 S.E.2d at 613 (citing Morgan,\r\n  326 S.C. at 513, 485 S.E.2d at 118).Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the supreme court, although affirming White's convictions on other\r\n  grounds, rejected the rationale and analytical framework of the court of\r\n  appeals.Â  The supreme court emphatically declared the Morgan rule to be\r\n  an incorrect statement of the law.Â  White, 382 S.C. at 273-74, 676\r\n  S.E.2d at 688.Â  The White court explicitly overruled Morgan &quot;to the extent it suggests that only scientific expert testimony must pass\r\n  a threshold reliability determination by the trial court prior to its admission\r\n  into evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 273, 676 S.E.2d at 688.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  foundation of the White decision is that all expert testimony\r\n  must satisfy Rule 702, SCRE, including the trial court's gatekeeping function of\r\n  ensuring the proposed expert testimony meets a threshold level of reliability,\r\n  regardless of whether it is scientific or nonscientific.Â  Id.Â  White holds that in discharging this gatekeeping role, &quot;a trial court must\r\n  assess the threshold foundational requirements of qualification and reliability\r\n  and further find that the proposed evidence will assist the trier of fact[,\r\n  and] . . . only after the court has vetted the matters of qualifications and\r\n  reliability and admitted the evidence&quot; may challenges be dismissed as\r\n  going to the weight rather than admissibility.Â  Id. at 274, 676 S.E.2d\r\n  at 688.Â  The White court stated the tenant of evidence law in which a\r\n  challenge goes to the weight and not the admissibility of the evidence\r\n  &quot;has never been intended to supplant the gatekeeping role of the trial\r\n  court in the first instance in assessing the admissibility of expert testimony,\r\n  including the threshold determination of reliability.&quot;Â  Id. at 273,\r\n  676 S.E.2d at 688.Â  Both scientific and nonscientific expert testimony is\r\n  subject to Rule 702, &quot;both in terms of expert qualifications and\r\n  reliability of the subject matter.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Thus, the trial court\r\n  must make an initial finding that the nonscientific expert's methods meet a\r\n  threshold level of reliability.Â  See id. at 272-73, 676 S.E.2d at\r\n  688 (stating the Morgan rule that &quot;[i]f the expert's opinion does\r\n  not fall within [the] Jones [standard for scientific expert testimony],\r\n  questions about the reliability of an expert's methods go only to the weight,\r\n  but not admissibility, of the testimony&quot; is an incorrect statement\r\n  law).Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the White court held the foundational reliability of nonscientific\r\n  testimony must be tested prior to the qualification of an expert, it further stated\r\n  that such a requirement does not lend itself to a &quot;one-size-fits-all\r\n  approach.&quot; Â Id. at 274, 676 S.E.2d at 688.Â  Rather, the court only\r\n  created a six part test for the reliability of expert canine tracking evidence,[6] and made no attempt to derive a formulaic approach for all nonscientific\r\n  experts, as it could &quot;not pretend to know the myriad of Rule 702\r\n  qualification and reliability challenges that could arise with respect to\r\n  nonscientific expert evidence.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Consequently, this court is\r\n  left with no guidance on what test or elements must be satisfied to establish\r\n  the foundational reliability necessary to qualify an expert in the fields of\r\n  crime scene analysis and victimology.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, the parties agree that crime scene analysis and victimology\r\n  are nonscientific areas of expertise.Â  Further, the parties also concede the trial\r\n  court's ruling that Tapp's challenges went only to the weight of the evidence\r\n  rested on the very same rationale that the supreme court specifically overruled\r\n  in White.Â  Therefore, although proper at the time it was made, the\r\n  ruling does not comport with White's requirement that the trial court\r\n  first make a threshold determination of reliability before dismissing such attacks\r\n  as going only to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the only issue remaining is whether the record in this matter is\r\n  sufficient for this court to determine, on its own, if the requirements of the White decision could have been met.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State argues the record in this case is sufficient for this court to determine\r\n  whether Prodan should have been qualified under White.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of its position, the State highlights: (1) Prodan's credentials,\r\n  education and experience, (2) his ability to rule out various scenarios of how\r\n  or why the crime transpired, and (3) the process's relative success as an\r\n  investigative tool to law enforcement.Â  While these arguments are relevant, we\r\n  find they go to the other White elements, (i.e., the expert's\r\n  credentials, education, or experience and the ability of the expert to assist\r\n  the trier of fact) rather than the element of reliability.Â  See id. at 274, 676 S.E.2d at 689 (indicating that under Rule 702 the State must\r\n  establish: (1) the expert has the requisite qualifications, experience, and/or\r\n  credentials; (2) the methodology by which the evidence is obtained is reliable;\r\n  and (3) the evidence will assist the trier of fact).Â  Moreover, we are not\r\n  convinced that the process's relative success as an &quot;investigative\r\n  tool&quot; renders it per se reliable in the context of qualifying an\r\n  expert.Â  See, e.g., Lorenzen v. State, 376 S.C. 521, 533, 657\r\n  S.E.2d 771, 778 (2008) (stating that the South Carolina Supreme Court &quot;\r\n  'has consistently held the results of polygraph examinations are generally not\r\n  admissible because the reliability of the tests is questionable.' &quot; (quoting State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 23, 515 S.E.2d 508, 519 (1999))).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  although the State initially indicated the Council factors for the\r\n  reliability of scientific testimony[7] are wholly irrelevant in the context of nonscientific experts, it nonetheless\r\n  proposes this court could find White is satisfied based on (1) the\r\n  inherent reliability of the photos and reports Prodan used to derive his\r\n  opinion, because such information is of the type other experts in the field\r\n  rely upon; and (2) the fact that some of Prodan's cases have been peer\r\n  reviewed.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  do not agree with the State's position that the Council factors are\r\n  wholly irrelevant.Â  As the State's discrepant argument implies, some of the Council factors may be quite relevant.Â  The fact that some of Prodan's cases have been\r\n  peer reviewed could be significant.Â  However, the record indicates that only some cases have been peer reviewed.Â  The record does not indicate that this\r\n  particular case was subject to peer review, nor does it demonstrate Prodan's\r\n  rate of success or accuracy in predicting what actually occurred at a crime\r\n  scene.Â  Furthermore, much of the State's position neglects that of manifest\r\n  concern to the trial court's threshold determination is not only the\r\n  reliability of the information Prodan used, but also the reliability of the\r\n  process by which that information is synthesized and analyzed in order to\r\n  develop a final opinion.Â  For instance, in White, the inquiry did not\r\n  focus solely on the reliability of the expert dog handler, but also on the\r\n  reliability of his method of tracking: that is, the use of a particular dog and\r\n  how that dog's skills were employed under the given circumstances.Â  Similarly,\r\n  the inquiry in this case cannot focus solely upon how reliable Prodan himself\r\n  is, but must assess the reliability of the process by which he derives his\r\n  opinion, whatever that process may be.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  without the guidance of the White decision, Tapp was not able to\r\n  sufficiently develop and pursue theories upon which to challenge Prodan's\r\n  qualification; nor was the trial court given the opportunity to address the\r\n  issue.Â  We find that given the deficient nature of he record on this issue it\r\n  would be imprudent of this court to attempt to fashion a test or rule for the\r\n  qualification of a crime scene analyst or victimologist.Â  Rather, justice\r\n  demands this burden first be placed upon the trial court after allowing the\r\n  parties to fully develop the issue.Â  \r\nIn light of our\r\n  decision on this issue, we need not address Tapp's allegation that Prodan's\r\n  testimony was improperly admitted, or the remaining issues on appeal. Â See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that an appellate court need not address\r\n  remaining issues when a decision on a prior issue is dispositive);Â  Whiteside\r\n    v.

Michael Smith, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Eric Jackson appeals the entry of\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Grosfillex, Inc., regarding claims of products\r\n  liability stemming from the collapse of a chair in which Jackson sat while he\r\n  was staying at the Bermuda Sands Resort hotel (Bermuda Sands).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJackson and his family were guests at Bermuda Sands in\r\n  Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  During their stay, Jackson visited the indoor\r\n  swimming pool located on the premises, and while there, attempted to sit in a\r\n  white resin chair located by the pool.Â  Upon partially sitting down, the chair\r\n  collapsed underneath Jackson, breaking into several pieces and causing him to\r\n  fall to the ground.Â  As a result of the fall, Jackson claimed to have suffered\r\n  injuries to his back and legs, causing physical pain, mental anguish and\r\n  suffering, as well as alleging it caused and will cause Jackson to incur\r\n  medical costs and loss of wages.Â  \r\nShortly\r\n  after the collapse, the broken chair was disposed of by a Bermuda Sands\r\n  maintenance person, Hinson Sellers, and was therefore unavailable for\r\n  introduction into evidence or for testing by the parties.Â  As a result, the\r\n  exact manufacturer of the broken chair was also not known to the parties with complete\r\n  certainty.[1]Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Jackson brought an action for actual and punitive damages against Bermuda Sands\r\n  for negligence in failing to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe\r\n  condition, as well as against Grosfillex, as alleged manufacturer, and Custom\r\n  Outdoor Furniture and Restrapping, Inc., as alleged distributor of the broken\r\n  chair, for negligence, recklessness, strict liability, and breach of implied\r\n  warranty.Â  Bermuda Sands settled with Jackson via mediation and was dismissed\r\n  as a defendant.Â  Grosfillex and Custom Outdoor filed motions for summary\r\n  judgment, which were ultimately granted by the circuit court.Â  Jackson appeals\r\n  the grant of summary judgment[2] in favor of Grosfillex.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJackson asserts the circuit court erred in finding:Â  the\r\n  unsupervised use and abuse of chairs in hotels was not foreseeable to\r\n  Grosfillex; degradation of resin chairs due to chemical exposure, eventually\r\n  leading to the inevitable failure of the chairs, was not a foreseeable event\r\n  that should have been anticipated; Jackson's failure to identify the cause of\r\n  an alleged crack was fatal to the claim; and, expert testimony was insufficient,\r\n  where Jackson's experts arrived at the scientific conclusion most probable\r\n  given the inability to examine the broken chair.Â  We disagree and affirm.\r\nProducts liability in South Carolina is governed by section\r\n  15-73-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005) which states:\r\n\r\n\t(1) One\r\n  who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the\r\n  user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm\r\n  caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) The seller is engaged in the business of selling\r\n  such a product, and(b) It is expected to and does reach the user or\r\n  consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\r\n\t\r\n\t(2) The\r\n  rule stated in subsection (1) shall apply although\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) The seller has exercised all possible care in the\r\n  preparation and sale of his product, and(b) The user or consumer has not bought the product\r\n  from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAn action for products liability\r\n  may be brought under several theories, including negligence, strict liability,\r\n  and warranty.Â  Rife v. Hitachi Const. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209,\r\n  215, 609 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In a products liability action, regardless of the theory of recovery\r\n  pursued, a plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) he was injured by the\r\n  product; (2) the injury occurred because the product was in a defective\r\n  condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user; and (3) the product, at the time\r\n  of the accident, was in essentially the same condition as when it left the\r\n  hands of the defendant.Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  In addition,\r\n  liability for negligence also requires proof that the manufacturer breached its\r\n  duty to exercise reasonable care to adopt a safe design.Â  Id. at 215,\r\n  609 S.E.2d at 569 Â (citations omitted).Â  Here, Jackson has failed to establish\r\n  elements (2) and (3).\r\nSection 15-73-30 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2005) incorporates by reference section 402A of the\r\n  Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) wherein it explains:\r\n\r\n\tg.\r\n  Defective condition. Â The rule stated in\r\n  this Section applies only where the product is, at the time it leaves the\r\n  seller's hands, in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which\r\n  will be unreasonably dangerous to him. Â The seller is not liable when he delivers\r\n  the product in a safe condition, and subsequent mishandling or other causes make it harmful by the time it\r\n  is consumed. Â The burden of proof that the product was in a defective condition\r\n  at the time that it left the hands of the particular seller is upon the injured\r\n  plaintiff; and unless evidence can be produced which will support the\r\n  conclusion that it was then defective, the burden is not sustained.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Moreover,\r\n  in order to successfully prosecute a products liability claim, a plaintiff must\r\n  prove the product defect was the proximate cause of the injury sustained.Â  Rife,\r\n  363 S.C. at 215, 609 S.E.2d at 569 (citations omitted).Â  &quot;Proximate cause\r\n  requires proof of causation in fact and legal cause.&quot;Â  Id. at 216,\r\n  609 S.E.2d at 569.Â  &quot;Causation in fact is proved by establishing the\r\n  injury would not have occurred 'but for' the defendant's negligence.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe key element of\r\n  proximate cause in South Carolina is foreseeablity.Â  Id.Â  The test of\r\n  foreseeability is whether the injury to another is the natural and probable\r\n  consequence of the complained-of act. Â Id. Â In order for an act to be a\r\n  proximate cause of the injury, the injury must be a foreseeable consequence of\r\n  the act.Â  Id.Â  However, an intervening force may be a superseding cause\r\n  that relieves an actor from liability, although the intervening cause must be\r\n  one that could have been reasonably foreseen or anticipated.Â  Id. at\r\n  217, 609 S.E.2d at 569 (citing Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C.\r\n  448, 494 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1997)).\r\nRegarding any\r\n  misuse or abuse of the chairs, Jackson has failed to prove the chair that\r\n  collapsed was in a defective condition when it was shipped by Grosfillex.Â  In\r\n  addition, a manufacturer may not be held liable for the subsequent mishandling\r\n  or other superseding act which causes the injury.Â  See Section 402A(g)\r\n  Restatement (Second) Torts.Â  Jackson asserts precisely this, namely:Â  because\r\n  Grosfillex's chairs are typically used at hotels, and deposition testimony\r\n  indicated chairs are frequently subjected to extreme conditions such as being\r\n  used on the street, thrown off balconies or into pools, as well as multiple\r\n  people sitting in a chair at one time, Grosfillex should be on notice that the\r\n  resin chair it produces is defective in its current state.Â  The circuit court\r\n  recognized that Jackson failed to prove not only the existence of a crack, which\r\n  Jackson's expert, Harry Edmondson, maintained could be the only explanation for\r\n  the collapse, but also whether any such crack existed in the chair at the time\r\n  it left the manufacturer.Â  \r\nEdmondson\r\n  conducted certain tensile tests on an exemplar Grosfillex chair which showed\r\n  that the chair passed the applicable American Society for Testing Materials\r\n  (ASTM) standards for strength requirements, which also validated the affidavit\r\n  filed by Grosfillex's Vice-President of Manufacturing and Logistics, Daniel\r\n  Yearick.Â  However, Edmondson admitted he had no way of knowing whether there\r\n  were any cracks in the chair or whether it had been subject to abuse, and could\r\n  only guess or speculate as to how any alleged crack could have occurred,\r\n  because the Grosfillex chairs were made pursuant to industry standards. Â Accordingly,\r\n  Grosfillex cannot be held liable for the intervening and superseding acts of\r\n  the ultimate users of its products, which could not have been reasonably\r\n  foreseen or anticipated.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  Jackson's claims regarding chemical degradation are based not on any tangible\r\n  evidence derived from the collapsed chair or the Bermuda Sands environment;\r\n  rather, they amount to mere speculation and conjecture.Â  A jury issue is\r\n  created when there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the\r\n  mind of a reasonable juror.Â  Small, 329 S.C. at 461, 494 S.E.2d at 841\r\n  (citation omitted) (discussing submission of an issue to the jury in the\r\n  context of a directed verdict motion).Â  &quot;However, this rule does not\r\n  authorize submission of speculative, theoretical, and\r\n  hypothetical views to the jury.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;Our courts have\r\n  recognized that when only one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for the court.&quot;\r\n  Â Id. Â &quot;A corollary of this rule is that verdicts may not be\r\n  permitted to rest upon surmise, conjecture, or speculation.&quot; Â Id.Â  Finally, assertions as to\r\n  liability must be more than mere bald allegations made by the non-moving party\r\n  in order to create a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel.\r\n    and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 117, 410 S.E.2d 537, 546 (1991).\r\nHere,\r\n  Jackson contends the environment which surrounded the collapsed chair at the\r\n  hotel, including subjection to chlorine, suntan lotions and UV rays, caused\r\n  degradation to the chair's resin material which ultimately led to its\r\n  collapse.Â  In addition, Jackson claims that, because Grosfillex knew the\r\n  majority of its resin chairs would be used in situations where they would be subjected\r\n  to similar chemicals, it should have been on notice that its chairs were all\r\n  going to degrade and fail, thereby rendering its chairs defective in their\r\n  current state.Â  In support of this contention, Jackson again relied primarily\r\n  on the deposition testimony and affidavit of Edmondson.Â  At the outset,\r\n  Edmondson admitted he had not tested for the existence of UV stabilizers which Yearick\r\n  and Grosfillex claim are included in the composition of the chairs.Â  Similarly,\r\n  Edmondson's claims regarding the effect of chlorine, suntan lotions, and other\r\n  chemical agents on Grosfillex chairs were not based on first-hand knowledge\r\n  derived from scientific testing; instead, Edmondson relied on two references he\r\n  found on the internet.Â  Edmondson himself admitted the applicability of the\r\n  references to the collapsed chair in this instance amounted to guesses and\r\n  speculation. Â Therefore, his unsupported assertions of chemical degradation\r\n  warrant our affirmance of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nJackson's\r\n  contentions fail every part of the test for establishing liability in a\r\n  products liability claim.Â  First, Jackson cannot prove the collapsed chair was\r\n  defective, or that any alleged defective nature of the chair caused the\r\n  accident; nor can Jackson prove the chair, when it collapsed, was in the same\r\n  condition it was in when it left Grosfillex. Â Without test results on the\r\n  collapsed chair, Jackson's claims of misuse or abuse and chemical degradation\r\n  also fail the tests for proximate cause and foreseeability.Â  As a result, the\r\n  circuit court did not err in finding Jackson had failed to establish a triable\r\n  issue of fact.Â  The decision of the circuit court is thereforeÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur. Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For the\r\n  purposes of the summary judgment hearing only, all parties agreed to assume the\r\n  chair that collapsed was a Grosfillex product supplied to Bermuda Sands by Custom\r\n  Outdoor Furniture and Restrapping, Inc., but that if the motion was denied, the\r\n  issue would still be litigated. \r\n[2] When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion, this court applies the same standard of review as the trial court under\r\n  Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E2d 437,\r\n  443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when no issue exists as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  To determine whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the reviewing court must consider the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v.

Â Additionally, McCuen assisted in the\r\n  organization of a dent removal business after he left BMW.\r\nMcCuen filed a claim for benefits\r\n  under the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-1-10 to 42-19-40 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  This case originally\r\n  came before the single commissioner, who found McCuen sustained compensable\r\n  injuries to his neck, upper extremities, and hands by accident under South\r\n  Carolina Code Section 42-1-160.Â  Specifically, the single commissioner found\r\n  McCuen had no pain or other difficulties with his neck, upper extremities, and\r\n  hands prior to his employment with BMW.Â  The commissioner specifically noted\r\n  McCuen's job as a dent technician &quot;involved forcing his neck, arms, and\r\n  entire body into very awkward positions . . . .&quot;Â  Further, the single\r\n  commissioner stated McCuen's &quot;neck and entire upper extremity symptoms are\r\n  associated manifestations of his condition.&quot;Â  \r\nBMW appealed the single commissioner's decision to the Appellate\r\n  Panel, and the Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner's decision,\r\n  sustaining the order in its entirety.Â  Subsequently, BMW appealed the Appellate\r\n  Panel's decision to the circuit court, challenging only the portion pertaining\r\n  to a sustained injury to the neck.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Appellate\r\n  Panel's order, finding substantial evidence existed supporting the\r\n  &quot;finding that [McCuen] sustained a compensable injury to his neck as a\r\n  result of the injury by accident.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for\r\n  judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel.&nbsp; Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\n    Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).&nbsp; Under the scope of review established\r\n  in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\n  Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\n  reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.&nbsp; Stone v.\r\n    Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a\r\n  workers' compensation decision.&nbsp; Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357\r\n  S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp; The Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the\r\n  record.&nbsp; Shuler v.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2008).&nbsp; An injury\r\n  arises out of employment if a causal relationship between the conditions under\r\n  which the work is to be performed and the resulting injury is apparent to the\r\n  rational mind, upon consideration of all the\r\n  circumstances.&nbsp; Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 518,\r\n  466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996).&nbsp; &quot;The claimant has the burden\r\n  of proving facts that will bring the injury within the workers' compensation\r\n  law, and such award must not be based on surmise, conjecture or speculation.&quot;&nbsp; Clade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the sole issue on appeal is whether McCuen's neck injury arose out of and\r\n  during the course of his employment with BMW.[4]Â  Most of the testimony and medical reports\r\n  presented at the hearing before the single commissioner were devoted to\r\n  McCuen's injury to his hands and wrists.Â  There is little reference and\r\n  discussion of his neck injury in the Record on Appeal.Â  Additionally, McCuen\r\n  testified he first experienced soreness in his neck after he stopped working at\r\n  BMW.Â  McCuen stated he thought the problems with his hands and arms developed\r\n  because his job as a dent technician required him to continually apply pressure\r\n  on the joints in his hands.Â  When asked what he believed caused the neck\r\n  injury, he responded: &quot;I don't know what, exactly, that was.Â  I think it\r\n  had to do with something from the way I was in the awkward positions.&quot;Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, McCuen admitted he did not know how he hurt his neck.Â \r\n  Furthermore, McCuen testified he did not experience any neck problems until\r\n  three or four months after he had stopped working for BMW.Â  McCuen also did not\r\n  report any problems with his neck to any physician until an appointment with\r\n  Dr. Kutz in February of 2002.\r\nThe portions of the\r\n  record McCuen relies upon in his brief to support his substantial evidence\r\n  argument do not specifically assert his neck injury arose during and in the\r\n  course of his employment with BMW.Â  Instead, the record indicates McCuen\r\n  injured his hands and wrists while working as a dent technician at BMW, but he did\r\n  not know how or when he injured his neck.Â  In fact, Dr. Gardener's medical\r\n  reports reflect most of his time and attention was focused on the care and\r\n  treatment of McCuen's wrists.Â  While there is some mention of neck pain in the\r\n  reports, they do not indicate McCuen's neck problems resulted from his carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome or the work injury to his wrists.Â  In a letter responding to a\r\n  telephone conversation with McCuen's attorney, Dr. Gardner clarified that\r\n  McCuen's &quot;carpal tunnel syndrome while aggravated by his activity in the\r\n  auto industry was not the cause of it, but certainly delayed onset is very\r\n  typical.&quot;Â  Dr. Gardner did not indicate McCuen's neck injury was caused or\r\n  aggravated by his employment with BMW.Â  The record also confirms McCuen\r\n  operated his own landscaping company before, during, and after he worked for\r\n  BMW.Â  McCuen testified that in his landscaping business, he trimmed bushes,\r\n  over-seeded yards, and cut lawns; however, he had to dissolve the company in\r\n  March 2002 because of the pain in his hands.Â  Two former co-workers testified McCuen\r\n  continued doing landscaping work himself after he left BMW.Â  The work included\r\n  blowing leaves and cutting down a large bush.Â  These incidents occurred before\r\n  McCuen began experiencing neck pain.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find substantial evidence does not exist in the record to support the Appellate\r\n  Panel's finding that McCuen's neck injury arose out of and during the course of\r\n  his employment with BMW.Â  Therefore, the circuit court's order isÂ  Â \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTHOMAS and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  However, if a vehicle had a large dent, the repairs\r\n  were made off the assembly line.\r\n[2]Â Â  BMW terminated his employment in May of 2002.\r\n[3]Â  The South Carolina General Assembly recently\r\n  overhauled South Carolina's Workers' Compensation laws.&nbsp; These statutory\r\n  changes affect claims for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2007.&nbsp; See 2007 S.C.

Straight appeals from an\r\n  order of the special referee finding largely in favor of Michael H. Goss (Goss)\r\n  and his wife, Pamela W. Goss (Pam).Â  In particular, Straight appeals the\r\n  referee's findings relating to his claims the Gosses, as directors of\r\n  Timberline Building Systems, Inc. (Timberline), (1) received excess wages in\r\n  the nature of salary overrides; (2) misappropriated a corporate opportunity by\r\n  purchasing property the Gosses then leased to Timberline, which the Gosses\r\n  thereafter conveyed to their corporation, Commerce Properties, LLC (Commerce\r\n  Properties), and caused Timberline to pay rent to cover the Gosses' taxes and\r\n  mortgage on the property and also pay the rent of the Gosses' truss company;\r\n  (3) misappropriated a corporate opportunity by creating a truss company, Custom\r\n  Built Trusses, Inc. (CBT), which ultimately was succeeded by the Gosses'\r\n  company Structural Component Systems, Inc., and used Timberline employees and\r\n  materials for the benefit of the truss company; and (4) made inappropriate\r\n  distributions to themselves through another of the Gosses' companies, Allied\r\n  Products and Services, LLC (Allied).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1983, Straight, along with Larry Gandolfi and another person,\r\n  formed Eagle's Nest Homes, Inc. (Eagle's Nest), a company that distributes\r\n  panelized buildings through independent representatives.Â  In the spring of\r\n  1983, Straight and Gandolfi were searching for a multi-sided house to market\r\n  and found that a business called Deltec Homes produced a multi-sided, round\r\n  house.Â  Straight called Deltec and made an appointment with Goss, Deltec's\r\n  marketing manager.[1] Â Eagle's Nest purchased panelized houses from Deltec for approximately one year\r\n  and thereafter purchased the round houses from Kingsberry Homes, a company for\r\n  which Goss had previously worked and to which Goss had returned.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Straight, Gandolfi, and Goss began exploring the possibility of starting a new\r\n  company to manufacture panelized houses for Eagle's Nest.Â  \r\nIn January 1986, Goss prepared a prospectus for a company called\r\n  Timberline Manufacturing, Inc.Â  On February 28, 1986, Straight, Gandolfi, and\r\n  Goss signed a letter of intent, setting forth the parties' agreement in regard\r\n  to the formation of the company.Â  In particular, the letter of intent provided\r\n  the company would be devoted exclusively to the production and delivery of\r\n  Eagle's Nest homes, with other businesses and products added as warranted from\r\n  retained earnings.Â  It further stated Eagle's Nest homes would be purchased\r\n  exclusively from the company, provided that pricing and delivery terms were\r\n  competitive. The letter of intent also placed responsibility of day-to-day management\r\n  of the company on Goss as president, and set his compensation at $1,000 a week\r\n  plus two percent of sales orders, not to exceed $80,000 a year\r\n  without prior approval of Timberline's board of directors.Â  Goss testified the\r\n  purpose of Timberline was to capture the manufacturing profits that suppliers\r\n  Deltec and Kingsberry had previously realized from Eagle's Nest homes.Â  \r\nIn September 1986, Timberline Building Systems, Inc. was\r\n  incorporated by Straight, Gandolfi, Goss, and Pam, with these four likewise\r\n  listed as the initial directors.Â  However, shortly after incorporation,\r\n  Straight, Gandolfi, Goss, and Pam each owned twenty-three percent of the\r\n  company, with the president of Eagle's Nest, John Chester, owning the remaining\r\n  eight percent, and Goss and Chester became the directors of Timberline's\r\n  board.Â  Thereafter, Straight and Gandolfi Â fired Chester from Eagle's Nest,\r\n  resulting in Chester's dismissal as a director of Timberline in 1991, and Pam's\r\n  replacement of him on the board.[2]Â  \r\nTimberline manufactured the panelized homes, and Eagle's Nest sold\r\n  them.Â  As part of its production of the homes, Timberline would fabricate them,\r\n  provide drawings, codes, and packing lists needed to build the homes, load\r\n  them, and contact the trucking company for delivery to the job site.Â  At some\r\n  point, Timberline also manufactured some homes for American Accent Homes, Inc.\r\n  (American Accent), a company started by Straight and Gandolfi in 1986, which\r\n  was the only other Timberline customer of any significance.[3]Â  For a period of about four to six\r\n  years, Timberline provided between eight to twelve houses a year\r\n  for American Accent.Â  During this time, in March 1990, Straight bought\r\n  Gandolfi's interest in Eagle's Nest.Â  Straight wanted to shut down American\r\n  Accent, but Gandolfi instead talked Straight into selling his interest in\r\n  American Accent to another man, Mr. Helms.Â  While Straight sold his shares in\r\n  American Accent, Gandolfi retained his shares. A conflict eventually developed\r\n  between Straight and Gandolfi regarding American Accent.Â  As a result, Straight\r\n  requested Timberline initiate a lawsuit against American Accent.[4]Â  Timberline subsequently incurred\r\n  over $184,000 in legal fees related to the action against American Accent.Â  \r\nAllied Products and Services, LLC was a separate company set up by\r\n  Goss and Pam.Â  From 1993 through 1998, Timberline transferred funds to Allied\r\n  totaling $341,772.Â  According to Goss, the company was set up based on a model\r\n  of one of Straight's companies, and with the advice of both an accountant and\r\n  an attorney, for the purpose of distributing equal profits to the Gosses as\r\n  were distributed to Straight.Â Â  Allied did not manufacture any products, but\r\n  did provide some payroll services to Timberline in the early years of the\r\n  company.Â  \r\nWhile Timberline initially leased premises for the manufacture of\r\n  the panelized homes, the leased premises incurred two separate fires over the\r\n  years and were acquired by a new landlord, who wanted to take over the building\r\n  occupied by Timberline.Â  Thereafter, Goss and Pam found and purchased at an\r\n  auction for themselves property (the Wickes property) that met Timberline's\r\n  needs in August 1997, and in early 1998, Timberline moved to this new\r\n  facility.Â  Rent was charged to Timberline based on the recommendation of an\r\n  economic development director as to what constituted competitive rent for that\r\n  space.Â  The Wickes property was subsequently transferred to Commerce Properties\r\n  in December 1999.Â  \r\nIn June 1998, Pam purchased truss manufacturing machinery and\r\n  started a company called Custom Built Trusses (CBT).Â Â Â  In July 1998, CBT began\r\n  building trusses in one of the buildings located on the Wickes property.Â  In\r\n  October 1998, CBT's articles of incorporation were filed listing Pam as the registered\r\n  agent for and incorporator of the business.Â  CBT supplied the trusses\r\n  Timberline needed for the manufacture of panelized houses, with cost based on\r\n  the price charged by Timberline's previous supplier before that company's\r\n  latest price increase.Â  \r\nOver time, Timberline experienced serious financial difficulties\r\n  as sales declined substantially.Â  It delivered its last home for Eagle's Nest\r\n  in March 2000.Â  Goss began closing Timberline down at that time and continued\r\n  that process until around June of that year.Â  CBT ceased operating on December\r\n  31, 2000.Â  In January 2001, Goss and Pam began operating Structural Component\r\n  Systems, Inc., a company that is the successor of CBT.Â Â Â  In April 2001,\r\n  Straight filed this action.Â Â Â  Thereafter, in June 2005, Timberline filed for\r\n  bankruptcy and this matter was automatically stayed. Straight moved the\r\n  bankruptcy court to lift the stay and, as a result of negotiations between\r\n  Straight and the bankruptcy trustee, the bankruptcy court modified the stay to\r\n  allow the action to move forward, provided all proceeds recovered in the action\r\n  be transmitted to the trustee and be property of the bankruptcy estate.Â  \r\nThis matter was heard by a special referee by order of reference\r\n  dated September 29, 2005.Â  The referee noted Straight had abandoned his\r\n  individual claims and chose to continue on the derivative claims alone,Â \r\n  asserting the following four causes of action in his derivative suit:Â  (1)\r\n  negligent mismanagement; (2) conversion, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, and (4)\r\n  civil conspiracy.Â  The referee found the specific claims by Straight included\r\n  the payment of excess wages to the Gosses, the use of Timberline employees and\r\n  material for CBT, the purchase of the Wickes property and development of the\r\n  truss business, and the transfer of funds to Allied from Timberline.Â  The\r\n  referee further noted the Gosses had brought a counterclaim against StraightÂ \r\n  and a third party claim against Eagle's Nest for money owed Timberline and for\r\n  minority shareholder oppression.Â  \r\nAfter considering the evidence, the referee determined (1) no\r\n  excess salary had been received by the Gosses, (2) the funds initially provided\r\n  by Timberline for the payment of CBT employees were offset by the trusses delivered\r\n  to Timberline but not paid to CBT, (3) Timberline did not have the ability to\r\n  acquire the Wickes property and no funds of Timberline were improperly used to\r\n  improve the Wickes property for the benefit of Commerce, (4) Timberline did not\r\n  have the capital and resources necessary for the creation of a truss business\r\n  and the truss business therefore was not a business opportunity for Timberline,\r\n  and Timberline was treated fairly in all respects by CBT, and (5) the transfer\r\n  of funds to Allied, along with certain payments of attorney's fees and special\r\n  commissions, were essentially distributions of profits to the shareholders, and\r\n  after considering the distributions made, the Gosses had received $21,449.97\r\n  more than Straight in distributions which the Gosses should return to\r\n  Timberline based upon Straight's assignment of his claims to the company.Â Â Â Â \r\n  Further, as equitable considerations, the referee found Straight used his\r\n  influence as Timberline's primary customer to continually defeat price\r\n  increases and used coercion, by continually threatening to remove all his\r\n  business.Â  He further found Straight made only a nominal initial investment in Timberline, refused to guarantee any bank loans, and risked nothing for his\r\n  fifty percent ownership of Timberline for which he in turn received large\r\n  returns.Â  He also determined Straight routinely insisted upon liquidation and\r\n  distribution of monies from Timberline.Â  He concluded Straight's &quot;conscious\r\n  harassment of the Gosses&quot; constituted unclean hands, and Straight was\r\n  seeking to be unjustly enriched by his claims of misappropriated corporate\r\n  opportunities.Â  The referee determined there was no negligent mismanagement, no\r\n  misappropriation of corporate assets or opportunities, no breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty and no civil conspiracy by the Gosses, and found the imposition of a constructive\r\n  trust sought by Straight would be inappropriate under the circumstances.Â Â  He\r\n  also determined Straight came into the court with unclean hands and such a\r\n  defense could be properly raised in a derivative claim.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Whether the Gosses violated their duties as Timberline's\r\n    officers and directors by engaging in undisclosed conflict of interest\r\n    transactions with the corporation and failed to prove the fairness of the\r\n    transactions.\r\n  2.Â \r\n    Whether there was a claim stated upon which to offset the amount of the\r\n    attorney's fees or the special discounts against the conflict of interest\r\n    transactions.\r\n  3.Â \r\n    Whether the defense of unclean hands applies to conflict of interest\r\n    transactions or matters unrelated to the litigation.\r\n  4.Â  Whether the common paymaster doctrine\r\n    applies when employees are paid by one corporation but work exclusively for\r\n    another when there is no common ownership.\r\n  5.Â \r\n    Whether corporate directors are liable for misappropriated corporate\r\n    opportunities when no disclosure was made to disinterested shareholders.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA shareholder's derivative action, as well as an action for\r\n  stockholder oppression, is one in equity.Â  McDuffie v. O'Neal, 324 S.C.\r\n  297, 302-03 476 S.E.2d 702, 705 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Therefore, this court may\r\n  find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence. Inlet Harbour v. S.C. Dep't of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism,\r\n  377 S.C. 86, 91, 659 S.E.2d 151, 154 (2008).Â  However, we are not required to\r\n  disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and\r\n  was in a better position to judge their credibility.Â  Sloan v. Greenville\r\n    County, 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEngaging in\r\n  Undisclosed Conflict of Interest Transactions\r\nStraight first contends the special referee erred in failing to\r\n  properly analyze the Gosses' conflict of interest transactions under section\r\n  33-8-310 of the South Carolina Code (2006).Â  In particular, he argues the\r\n  Gosses engaged in three conflict of interest transactions: (1) the payment of\r\n  salary overrides for the years 1995, 1996, and 1997, (2) the purchase of\r\n  property and creation of a truss company by the Gosses, initially funded by\r\n  Timberline assets, and (3) distributions of money to Allied from 1993 to 1998.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nSection 33-8-310 which governs standards of conduct for directors\r\n  and officers of a corporation involving conflict of interest transactions,\r\n  provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the\r\n    corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect\r\n    interest.Â  A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the\r\n    corporation solely because of the director's interest in the transaction if any\r\n    one of the following is true:\r\n  \r\n    (1) the material facts of the transaction and the\r\n      director's interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a\r\n      committee of the board of directors, and the board of directors or a committee\r\n      authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;\r\n    (2) the material facts of the transaction and the\r\n      director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to\r\n      vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;Â  or\r\n    (3) the transaction was fair to the corporation.\r\n    If (1) or (2) has been accomplished, the burden of\r\n      proving unfairness of any transaction covered by this section is on the party\r\n      claiming unfairness.Â  If neither (1) nor (2) has been accomplished, the party\r\n      seeking to uphold the transaction has the burden of proving fairness.\r\n  \r\n  (b)\r\n    For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect\r\n    interest in a transaction if (1) another entity in which he has a material\r\n    financial interest or in which he is a general partner is a party to the\r\n    transaction or (2) another entity of which he is a director, officer, or\r\n    trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be\r\n    considered by the board of directors of the corporation.\r\n  (c) For purposes of subsection (a)(1), a conflict of\r\n    interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the\r\n    affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors (or\r\n    on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction,\r\n    but a transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this\r\n    section by a single director.Â  If a majority of the directors who have no\r\n    direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or\r\n    ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section.Â  The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a\r\n    direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of\r\n    any action taken under subsection (a)(1) if the transaction is otherwise\r\n    authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection.\r\n  (d) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), a conflict of\r\n    interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the\r\n    vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection.Â \r\n    Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or\r\n    indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the\r\n    control of an entity described in subsection (b)(1), may not be counted in a\r\n    vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a\r\n    conflict of interest transaction under subsection (a)(2).Â  The vote of those\r\n    shares, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved\r\n    under other sections of Chapters 1 through 20 of this Title.Â  A majority of the\r\n    shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on\r\n    the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of\r\n    taking action under this section.\r\n\r\nÂ Â§ 33-8-310. \r\nÂ Salary Overrides \r\nStraight contends the special referee erred in finding Goss's\r\n  salary overrides in 1995, 1996, and 1997 were proper as they were neither\r\n  disclosed nor approved and, therefore, were only valid if they were fair to the\r\n  corporation.Â  He argues the Gosses failed to meet their burden to establish\r\n  fairness under section 33-8-310(b) as they failed to offer any evidence of fairness\r\n  given the declining business and increased cash needs of Timberline during this\r\n  time.Â  We disagree.\r\nStraight testified, based on his concern that someone running\r\n  Timberline would be able to increase salary and diminish the shareholders'\r\n  ability to pull out profits, the parties agreed a salary of approximately\r\n  $80,000 a year would be paid to Goss and that any other income he would earn\r\n  would come from distributions and profits.Â  At trial, he presented a\r\n  document purporting the Gosses received excess wages of $214,233 in 1995,\r\n  $66,864 in 1996, and $101,670 in 1997, while the number of packages Timberline\r\n  produced for Eagle's Nest during those years was declining.Â Â Â  \r\nAs previously noted, the letter of intent provided Goss was to\r\n  receive a salary of $1,000 per week plus a sales override of two percent, not\r\n  to exceed $80,000 per year &quot;without prior approval of Timberline's Board\r\n  of Directors.&quot;Â  Thus, contrary to Straight's testimony, Goss's salary was\r\n  not strictly limited to $80,000 a year with his only other source of income\r\n  from the company to be income received as distribution of profits, as the\r\n  letter of intent clearly contemplates Goss's salary may increase with board\r\n  approval.Â  The record shows that at a Timberline Board of Directors meeting on\r\n  May 12, 1993, directors Goss and Pam, after noting Timberline's recent improved\r\n  profitability, approved an increase in overrides to five and a half percent of\r\n  sales.[5] Â At this time, Pam had replaced Chester as a director when Straight and\r\n  Gandolfi voted Chester off the board.Â  According to Goss, the by-laws required\r\n  a minimum of two directors, and because Straight and Gandolfi refused to serve\r\n  on the board, the only other available person to take the position was Pam.Â \r\n  Certainly by 1995 and thereafter, the only three shareholders in Timberline\r\n  were Straight, Goss, and Pam, with Straight owning fifty percent and Goss and\r\n  Pam owning the remaining fifty percent.Â  Accordingly, Straight was aware from\r\n  the letter of intent that the board could increase the compensation for Goss.Â \r\n  He was further aware it became necessary for Pam to replace Chester on the\r\n  board when he refused to serve.Â  He therefore knew that Goss and Pam, as the\r\n  directors, would be determining whether Goss's salary could exceed $80,000 a\r\n  year.\r\nIn addition to Straight's knowledge that Goss and Pam could make\r\n  changes to the compensation, there is evidence of record that the Gosses made\r\n  significant financial and sweat equity contributions to Timberline.Â  In\r\n  particular, although the letter of intent anticipated initial capital\r\n  requirements of approximately $195,000 or less, with half the amount to be\r\n  contributed by the Gosses and the other half to be contributed by Straight and\r\n  Gandolfi, the record shows Straight and Gandolfi actually contributed only\r\n  $25,000 and refused to co-sign any loans to finance any further necessary\r\n  capital.[6]Â Â Â \r\n  According to Goss, the business was ultimately started with $150,000 in funds.Â \r\n  Goss stated he and Pam put $25,000 of capital into the business by borrowing\r\n  from their pension.Â  The parties had agreed the remaining $100,000 was to be\r\n  borrowed, and the bankers Goss met with requested Straight and Gandolfi co-sign\r\n  for a loan.Â  However, Straight and Gandolfi adamantly refused to sign any\r\n  notes.Â  One of the bankers ultimately agreed to loan Timberline money on the\r\n  Gosses' personal guarantee if Straight and Gandolfi &quot;put up $50,000.&quot;\r\n  The Gosses ultimately gave their personal guarantee to obtain a loan from the\r\n  bank.Â  Although Straight maintained he and Gandolfi also provided a $50,000\r\n  loan to Timberline, Goss testified this loan was only short term, being made in\r\n  September and paid off by the following February, and was a way to satisfy\r\n  their banker and get around the fact Straight and Gandolfi had refused to\r\n  co-sign on the loan.Â  Thereafter, Goss and Pam guaranteed all of Timberline's\r\n  loans and letters of credit, at times pledging their own personal assets.[7]Â  Additionally, Goss testified over\r\n  the course of years he and Pam both worked sixteen hour days, as well as some weekends, and had invested their money and personally guaranteed debts of\r\n  Timberline.Â  \r\nParagraph four of the official comments for section 33-8-310\r\n  discusses the &quot;fairness&quot; of a transaction and provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  The fairness of a transaction for purposes of section\r\n    8.31 (Section 33-8-310) should be evaluated on the basis of the facts and\r\n    circumstances as they were known or should have been known at the time the\r\n    transaction was entered into.Â  For example, the terms of a transaction subject\r\n    to section 8.31 (Section 33-8-310) should normally be deemed &quot;fair&quot;\r\n    if they are within the range that might have been entered into at arms-length\r\n    by disinterested persons.\r\n\r\nGiven Straight's knowledge of the compensation parameters set\r\n  forth by the letter of intent along with his refusal to serve on the board,\r\n  leaving Pam as the only alternative director, and in consideration of the\r\n  Gosses' concerted efforts and financial support of Timberline, we believe the\r\n  Gosses have met their burden of showing the fairness of the additional\r\n  overrides paid in 1995, 1996, and 1997.Â  Additionally, based upon other equity\r\n  considerations discussed further in this opinion, we find no error in the\r\n  referee's determination that the Gosses were entitled to the salaries received\r\n  during these years.\r\nÂ Land Purchase and Truss Company\r\nStraight next contends the special referee erred in failing to\r\n  find improper the Gosses' purchase of the Wickes property and formation of the\r\n  truss company without disclosure to Straight.Â  Straight argues the Gosses had a\r\n  direct interest in the payment of rent by Timberline to themselves, and an\r\n  indirect interest in the supply of trusses by CBT to Timberline.Â  He asserts\r\n  these transactions violated the South Carolina Business Corporations Act's statutory\r\n  approval of such conflicts of interest as provided in section 33-8-310 because\r\n  there was neither disclosure nor approval.[8]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nStraight complains the Gosses purchased the Wickes property,\r\n  appraised at $1,300,000, for only $304,000, and Timberline could have done the\r\n  same with no out-of-pocket investment required of Timberline or its\r\n  shareholders.Â  Additionally, he maintains that the rent charged to Timberline\r\n  enabled the Gosses to make the mortgage payments and pay taxes on the property,\r\n  and further asserts Timberline paid CBT's rent.Â  As for the truss company,\r\n  Straight asserts the Gosses failed to disclose the existence of CBT until he\r\n  confronted Goss in December 1999 after receiving an anonymous clipping in the\r\n  mail.Â  He claims the Gosses also used Timberline to supply significant labor,\r\n  materials, and rent for CBT.\r\nThe Wickes Property\r\nThe record shows that on November 1, 1991, following the first\r\n  fire at the property initially leased by Timberline, the Timberline Board\r\n  approved the negotiation and purchase of land and the construction of a new\r\n  building for Timberline.Â  While Straight and Gandolfi agreed to such an\r\n  investment by Timberline, they informed Goss they were unwilling to give any\r\n  guarantees or make any investment in it.Â  Shortly thereafter, Timberline\r\n  acquired eight acres of raw land in Hodges, South Carolina.Â  Timberline however\r\n  remained at the leased premises, where a second fire ultimately occurred on the\r\n  property in 1994.Â  At this time, Timberline was on a month-to-month lease, and\r\n  the new landlord decided to take over the area leased to Timberline for his own\r\n  use, requiring Timberline to vacate the premises.Â  \r\nGoss testified he and Pam searched Greenwood and the neighboring\r\n  counties for a suitable location to lease, but were unable to find one that suited\r\n  Timberline's needs.Â  Eventually, Goss learned that the Wickes property was to\r\n  be auctioned, and he and Pam subsequently purchased it for $304,000 in August\r\n  1997.Â  The Gosses obtained a mortgage in the amount of $415,000, giving their\r\n  personal guarantee, and used the difference to make improvements to the\r\n  property.Â  Goss testified Timberline did not buy the property because, in\r\n  speaking with its banker, he knew Timberline could not borrow the money without\r\n  Straight's guarantee.Â  When presented with the idea of purchasing land and a\r\n  building and mortgaging it, Straight clearly indicated to Goss that Straight\r\n  would have no part of it and Goss would have to &quot;do it alone.&quot;Â Â \r\n  Timberline thus did not have the financial ability to secure a mortgage on the\r\n  property.Â  Additionally, rent of $4,527 a month was charged to Timberline after\r\n  Goss consulted the executive director of The Greenwood County Economic Alliance\r\n  as to what constituted competitive rent for that space.Â  Goss further testified\r\n  he informed Straight of the new rent charged Timberline and Straight &quot;seemed\r\n  happy with it.&quot;Â  \r\nBased on the evidence that Timberline did not have the financial\r\n  ability to acquire the Wickes property and the rent charged to Timberline was\r\n  competitive for the area leased, we find no error in the special referee's\r\n  refusal to find purchase of the Wickes property by the Gosses was improper\r\n  under section 33-8-310, as the evidence supports the fairness under the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Additionally, as with the salary overrides, based upon the\r\n  other equity considerations we find no error in the referee's determination\r\n  that the transactions involving the Wickes property were reasonable under the\r\n  circumstances. \r\nThe Truss Business\r\nGoss testified that Pam purchased truss machinery and started CBT\r\n  in the summer of 1998.Â Â  CBT and Timberline were located in the same compound,\r\n  on the Wickes property, but Timberline was in one building and CBT was in\r\n  another. Â Until a conversation with Straight in December 1999, Goss did not\r\n  inform Straight about the existence of CBT.Â  He and Pam borrowed the money in\r\n  their names to start the business because Straight had made it clear he was not\r\n  willing to co-sign, he wanted to take out Timberline's available retained\r\n  earnings, and he had made it abundantly clear he was not willing to engage in\r\n  any other business opportunities.Â  Goss testified Timberline was &quot;maxed\r\n  out,&quot; it could not borrow the money without back-up guarantees, it did not\r\n  have the retained earnings needed to engage in a business opportunity, and it\r\n  could not afford the equipment necessary for a truss business.Â  According to\r\n  Goss, they were in a difficult situation because Timberline had only one\r\n  customer, Eagle's Nest, and Straight kept threatening to pull Eagle's Nest's\r\n  business from them.Â  Given the limitations with Timberline, he and Pam were\r\n  trying to find a way to keep Timberline operating and to provide another source\r\n  of income for themselves.Â Â Â  Goss explained he did not discuss CBT with\r\n  Straight before the December 1999 conversation because he had experienced a\r\n  very difficult year with his son's illness and death, and in his preceding\r\n  conversations with Straight, Straight had &quot;basically washed his hands of\r\n  [Timberline].&quot;Â  Additionally, the truss company did not make a profit\r\n  until 2002, and had he &quot;thrown the [CBT] business losses on top of the\r\n  Timberline losses,&quot; Timberline would have been in an even more difficult\r\n  situation.Â  Goss stated that at the end of their December 1999 conversation\r\n  about the Gosses' decision to go into the truss business, Straight indicated to\r\n  Goss that it was &quot;just fine with him.&quot;Â  \r\nGoss maintained that upon advice from his attorney and accountant,\r\n  CBT and Timberline were operated as separate companies and in arm's length\r\n  transactions with competitive pricing.Â  The Gosses made improvements to the\r\n  Wickes property to accommodate Timberline's needs. According to Goss, the only\r\n  improvements made by Timberline to the property involved the running of\r\n  electrical and compressor lines the business needed and possibly &quot;another\r\n  item or two.&quot;Â  Goss admitted that for a very short period of time, while\r\n  his wife was out of town tending to their son's medical situation, some\r\n  materials ordered for CBT were inadvertently included on the Timberline\r\n  account, but the matter was corrected in an adjustment at the end of the\r\n  year.Â Â  Goss also admitted that some employees who worked exclusively for CBT\r\n  were paid from the Timberline payroll account.Â  Goss explained that Timberline\r\n  had five key employees that were vital to the continued operation of\r\n  Timberline.Â  Around the time CBT had started, Timberline was having difficulty\r\n  keeping all these employees on their payroll.Â  Two of Timberline's more\r\n  experienced and key people were moved into the truss business with the\r\n  expectation at some point Eagle's Nest business would return.Â  According to\r\n  Goss and two of the former employees of Timberline and CBT, the two businesses\r\n  had different managers, different time cards, and different time clocks.Â  Goss\r\n  testified, and also presented evidence from his accountant, that Timberline\r\n  incurred expenses with CBT for trusses, and that there was an annual accounting\r\n  of the goods and services between the two companies.Â  At the conclusion of the\r\n  reconciliation, Timberline was indebted to CBT in the amount of $14,878.Â Â  \r\nAs for the rent, the testimony does not show, as Straight\r\n  contends, that Timberline paid CBT's rent.Â  Rather, CBT entered its own lease\r\n  agreement with Commerce to pay $1,500 a month in rent for a much smaller area\r\n  than Timberline's.Â  Rent was charged on a prorated basis, with both Timberline\r\n  and CBT paying $2.50 per square foot.Â  While CBT apparently made only $1,500 in\r\n  monetary payments, its remaining rent accrued on the books and there is no\r\n  evidence this rent was paid by Timberline.Â  \r\nFurther, CBT charged Timberline the same price Timberline had been\r\n  paying its previous truss provider before that company announced a fifteen\r\n  percent price increase.Â  Accordingly, Timberline actually saved that fifteen\r\n  percent difference when it obtained trusses from CBT.Â  Additionally, Timberline\r\n  benefited from the arrangement inasmuch as it received custom quotes faster,\r\n  the quality of the trusses was somewhat superior, it received the trusses\r\n  themselves more quickly, and it incurred no delivery charge.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing evidence, we find no error in the referee's\r\n  determinations that the funds provided by Timberline for the payment of CBT\r\n  employees were offset by the trusses delivered to Timberline but not paid to\r\n  CBT, that Timberline did not have the ability to acquire the Wickes property\r\n  and no funds of Timberline were improperly used to improve the Wickes property\r\n  for the benefit of Commerce, and that Timberline did not have the\r\n  capital and resources necessary for the creation of a truss business and the\r\n  truss business was not a business opportunity for Timberline.Â  We further find\r\n  no merit to Straight's assertions the Gosses improperly used Timberline to\r\n  supply labor, materials, and rent for CBT.Â  Accordingly, we hold the special\r\n  referee did not err in failing to find the truss company transactions improper\r\n  under sectionÂ  33-8-310, as the evidence supports the fairness under the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Finally, as with the salary overrides and the Wickes property\r\n  purchase, based upon the other equity considerations we find no error in the\r\n  referee's determination that the transactions involving the truss business were\r\n  reasonable under the circumstances.\r\nÂ Allied Distributions\r\nStraight further contends the special referee erred in his\r\n  determination regarding the Allied distributions to the Gosses.Â  He argues the\r\n  referee improperly tied the Allied distributions to the American Accent legal\r\n  fees and special discounts because Goss's testimony on the matter was not\r\n  credible, it was reasonable for Timberline to incur these fees on its own\r\n  behalf, and the special discounts were made for legitimate business reasons.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nGoss testified that Allied was a company they used to enable him\r\n  to receive an equal amount of distributions from Timberline that Straight\r\n  received in the nature of legal fees incurred in the American Accent lawsuit\r\n  and some &quot;special deals&quot; Straight obtained from Timberline.Â  According\r\n  to Goss, Straight requested Timberline sue American Accent because American\r\n  Accent was competing with Eagle's Nest in its sale of dealerships.[9]Â  Goss stated the lawsuit did not\r\n  benefit Timberline at all, as American Accent was contributing to Timberline's\r\n  profitability and Goss did not want to lose that business, but Straight\r\n  insisted and Goss wanted to accommodate Straight.Â  Goss agreed to proceed with\r\n  the lawsuit as long as he received an equal distribution.Â  Because Timberline\r\n  risked losing its status as an S corporation if any unequal distributions were\r\n  made, Straight agreed that Goss and Pam would receive an equal amount in\r\n  distribution as were incurred in American Accent legal fees by Timberline.Â \r\n  Accordingly, upon Straight's suggestion that compensation could be made to a\r\n  consulting company, and after receiving advice from an accountant and an\r\n  attorney on the matter, Goss used Allied as the vehicle to handle the\r\n  offsetting distributions.Â Â  Minutes from a July 1993 board meeting reflect that\r\n  Timberline had been asked by Straight to join in the American Accent lawsuit\r\n  because Straight believed American Accent was competing unfairly with Eagle's\r\n  Nest.Â  According to the minutes, the board approved the action and further\r\n  approved Goss receiving &quot;compensation distributions equal to the legal\r\n  fees incurred in this legal matter.&quot;Â  A memo from Timberline's attorney in\r\n  the American Accent litigation indicates Timberline had incurred legal fees of\r\n  $184,416.92 related to that lawsuit.Â  \r\nGoss also testified that in 1992, Straight wanted to take\r\n  distributions from Timberline in the form of a two and a half percent &quot;special discount,&quot; to be received on top of the eight percent\r\n  volume rebate Eagle's Nest was receiving from Timberline.Â  According to Goss,\r\n  this was during a time Straight was arguing with Gandolfi, and Straight was\r\n  seeking a way to receive the money from Timberline without Gandolfi\r\n  benefiting.Â  Accordingly, Straight came up with the idea of this discount, and\r\n  agreed that Goss would take out a like amount.Â  Timberline's board meeting\r\n  minutes from February 1991 reflect that Eagle's Nest requested a special two\r\n  and a half percent discount, and that the board approved the request, noting &quot;a\r\n  like dollar amount . . . will also be granted to Mr. Goss.&quot;Â  Again, Allied\r\n  was used as the distribution vehicle for the Gosses.Â  \r\nWhile Straight asserts on appeal that the evidence shows Goss's\r\n  testimony was wholly unreliable, a thorough review of the entire record\r\n  convinces us otherwise.Â  Implicit within the referee's order is that the\r\n  referee found Goss was credible and Straight was not.Â  Though the actions of\r\n  the Gosses may appear inappropriate at first blush, an understanding of the\r\n  workings between the parties and their various businesses gives credence to\r\n  Goss's testimony regarding the reasons behind the actions he and his wife\r\n  took.Â  \r\nGoss testified at length to Straight's actions that required the\r\n  various reactions by Goss.Â  For instance, although Straight acknowledged in the\r\n  letter of intent that he and Gandolfi were to contribute half of the initial\r\n  capital investment, the two provided only $25,000 in a questionable transaction\r\n  from Eagle's Nest, only provided a short term loan to the company in order to\r\n  satisfy the bank in regard to their investment in the company, and refused to\r\n  co-sign or guarantee any loans.Â  This placed Goss and Pam in the position of\r\n  having to personally guarantee Timberline's loans and letters of credit alone,\r\n  taking on all of the risk of the company.Â  At the same time, Straight made\r\n  clear to Goss that he had no intention of ever guaranteeing any loans or\r\n  investing any more money in Timberline.Â  Goss also testified that Straight\r\n  consistently insisted that Timberline's profits be distributed, thereby leaving\r\n  no retained earnings in the business with which to invest in assets or other\r\n  lines of business.Â  Goss further testified that Straight insisted that\r\n  Timberline bring a legal action against American Accent, Timberline's only\r\n  other customer of any significance, even though only Straight and Eagle's Nest\r\n  stood to gain from such an action, and Timberline would only lose this\r\n  additional business.Â  Additionally, Goss related that although the parties had\r\n  agreed from inception that they would follow the Kingsberry pricing model in\r\n  setting the prices Timberline would charge for the panelized houses, Straight\r\n  fought Goss on each price increase mandated by the increased price of materials\r\n  for Timberline, and Straight refused to pay based on that pricing model as\r\n  originally agreed.Â Â  According to Goss, Straight called him in 1997 and told\r\n  Goss he was not going to worry about Timberline anymore, essentially washing\r\n  his hands of Timberline.Â  The record shows that while neither Straight nor the\r\n  Gosses held a majority of the shares in Timberline, Straight owned fifty\r\n  percent of the business and was the sole customer for the times most pertinent\r\n  to this litigation.Â  As such, Straight held a certain control over Goss and\r\n  Timberline, and constantly threatened to remove Eagle's Nest's business if Goss\r\n  failed to comply with his requests.Â  In fact, Straight's own expert, Professor\r\n  John Freeman, testified that in his judgment, Straight was a &quot;co-control\r\n  shareholder.&quot;Â  When asked if such a shareholder, who is &quot;also the\r\n  ninety-five percent customer&quot; of a corporation could be guilty of\r\n  corporate oppression if he threatens to take the business away from the\r\n  corporation, he responded that if the business is being threatened by a\r\n  controlling party causing the business to suffer, that could be a form of\r\n  corporate oppression.Â  \r\nAside from this support of the record, Goss also presented\r\n  evidence from two independent witnesses as to his credibility.Â  Reed Fickling,\r\n  an employee of an insurance agency, testified he provided insurance for\r\n  Timberline and Goss, and Goss was not his friend, but simply a client.Â \r\n  Fickling testified that from his experience with Goss, Goss &quot;was totally\r\n  truthful and totally honest&quot; and he would trust him implicitly.Â  Willie\r\n  Garvin, an accountant who provided services to Timberline until it ceased\r\n  operations, testified Goss had &quot;a very strong&quot; reputation in the\r\n  Greenwood business community, and he had heard someone comment that Goss &quot;was\r\n  as honest a person as they had ever met.&quot;Â  Garvin stated he found Goss to\r\n  be &quot;straightforward and responsive&quot; in answering questions in regard\r\n  to the business. \r\nWhile the record shows Goss enjoyed a reputation of honesty in the\r\n  business community, no such evidence was submitted by Straight.Â  On the other\r\n  hand, counsel for the Gosses successfully impeached Straight's testimony before\r\n  the referee.Â  Contrary to Goss's testimony, Straight stated he wanted\r\n  Timberline to be successful and never told Goss he was washing his hands of\r\n  Timberline. He further denied planning to remove Eagle's Nest's business from\r\n  Timberline. However, when confronted, Straight acknowledged he wrote a letter\r\n  to Gandolfi in 1991, which indicated plans to cease doing business with\r\n  Timberline.Â  In the letter, Straight proposed he give Gandolfi his shares in\r\n  American Accent in exchange for Gandolfi's stock in Timberline, and as\r\n  inducement for the agreement stated the deal would be more than fair to\r\n  Gandolfi, as Eagle's Nest was &quot;planning on ceasing doing business with\r\n  Timberline to open its own plant to increase profits.&quot;Â Â  Additionally,\r\n  Goss maintained that Straight called him in 1997 and implied he was going &quot;to\r\n  go out and do something different.&quot;Â  Straight admitted he faxed a document\r\n  to Goss dated January 14, 1997, which was a proposal for the licensing of a new\r\n  panelized house manufacturing facility located in a Native American community.Â \r\n  Implicit within this document was a threat by Straight to take Eagle's Nest\r\n  business away from Timberline.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the evidence supports Goss's\r\n  assertions that the legal fees and special discounts were provided for the\r\n  benefit of Straight and the parties agreed that these monies would be\r\n  considered distributions to Straight, for which the Gosses would receive the\r\n  equivalent through payments made to Allied.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in\r\n  the referee's determination in this regard.\r\nÂ Offset of Attorney's Fees and Special\r\nDiscounts\r\nStraight next contends the special referee erred in offsetting the\r\n  attorney's fees and special discounts against the Allied disbursements,\r\n  essentially performing an accounting, because there was no claim upon which to\r\n  base the offset.Â  He argues the referee went beyond the scope of the pleadings\r\n  in awarding such relief, and even if a counterclaim or third party claim had\r\n  requested the relief, such claims would be barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nA reading of the order shows the special referee did not perform\r\n  an accounting as asserted by Straight.Â  Nor did he address, nor rely on, any\r\n  counterclaim or third party claim of respondents as the basis for his decision\r\n  regarding treatment of the payments to Allied.Â  Rather, the referee considered\r\n  Straight's claim that the Gosses wrongfully caused Timberline to distribute\r\n  funds to themselves through Allied and the Gosses' defense that these payments\r\n  were proper inasmuch as they were actually shareholder distributions paid to\r\n  equalize distributions made to Straight in the form of attorney's fees and\r\n  special discounts.Â  The referee found that Allied provided the means to level\r\n  the distribution of money to Timberline shareholders, with offsetting\r\n  distributions to Straight through the attorney's fees and special discounts and\r\n  to the Gosses through disbursements to Allied, and that these were essentially\r\n  distributions of profits to shareholders.Â  Because the assertions regarding the\r\n  attorney's fees and special discounts were the Gosses' defense to Straight's\r\n  claims of wrongful payments through Allied, we find no merit to his argument.\r\nUnclean Hands\r\nStraight also contends the special referee erred in using the doctrine\r\n  of unclean hands to &quot;support the offset of attorney's fee and special\r\n  discounts or for any other purpose.&quot;Â  He argues the doctrine does not\r\n  apply to conflict of interest transactions, as the test is whether the\r\n  plaintiff is untainted with regard to the particular transaction of which he\r\n  complains, and in order for a plaintiff to be precluded from recovering in\r\n  equity under this doctrine, he must have acted unfairly in a matter that is the\r\n  subject of the litigation.Â  He maintains Timberline is the real party in\r\n  interest and is the victim of the Gosses' wrongdoing, and Timberline could not\r\n  have participated in the wrongdoing.[10]Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\n&quot;When this court is sitting in equity, and thus viewing\r\n  evidence for its preponderance, we are to consider the equities of both sides,\r\n  balancing the two to determine what, if any, relief to give.&quot;Â  Anderson\r\n    v. Buonforte, 365 S.C. 482, 493, 617 S.E.2d 750, 755 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;The\r\n  doctrine of unclean hands precludes a plaintiff from recovering in equity if he\r\n  acted unfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation to the\r\n  prejudice of the defendant.&quot;Â  First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden,\r\n  333 S.C. 554, 568, 511 S.E.2d 372, 379 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  &quot;'He who comes\r\n  into equity must come with clean hands.Â  It is far more than a mere banality.Â \r\n  It is a self-imposed ordinance that closes the door of the court of equity to\r\n  one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which\r\n  he seeks relief.'&quot;Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 220, 603 S.E.2d\r\n  598, 605 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Auto.\r\n    Maint. Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945)).Â  &quot;The decision to grant\r\n  equitable relief is in the discretion of the trial judge.&quot;Â  Soden,\r\n  333 S.C. at 568, 511 S.E.2d at 379.Â Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nContrary to Straight's assertion, the equitable defense of unclean\r\n  hands is available in a shareholder derivative action. See Gaudiosi\r\n    v. Mellon, 269 F.2d 873, 882 (3rd Cir. 1959) (stating &quot;even in a\r\n  stockholders' derivative action 'unclean hands' on the part of a plaintiff will\r\n  require dismissal of the action&quot;); Rosenfeld v.

App. Ct. 1989) (holding shareholder's derivative actions\r\n  are inventions of courts of equity, and even though a party may merely be a\r\n  nominal plaintiff bringing suit on behalf of a corporation, equity requires\r\n  that a shareholder derivative action cannot be maintained if the nominal\r\n  plaintiff has unclean hands in connection with the transactions which are the\r\n  bases for the litigation or has participated or acquiesced in, or benefited\r\n  from the conduct of which he now complains); Suter v. Mazyck, 226 S.W.3d\r\n  837, 843 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007) (noting defense of unclean handsÂ  applies\r\n  specifically to a stockholder's derivative action and the plaintiffs must have\r\n  not engaged in conduct which would forfeit their right to seek equitable relief\r\n  for the malfeasance of the corporate directors, officers, or majority\r\n  shareholders); Tierno v. Puglisi, 719 N.Y.S.2d 350, 353 (N.Y. App. Div.\r\n  2001) (holding that in order to establish the defense of unclean hands to a\r\n  stockholder's derivative action, the evidence must demonstrate that the\r\n  plaintiff's conduct was immoral or unconscionable, that the conduct of the\r\n  plaintiff was directly related to the subject matter in litigation and that the\r\n  party asserting the doctrine of unclean hands was thereby injured); Becker\r\n    v. Becker,Â  225 N.W.2d 884, 885 (Wis. 1975) (holding in a derivative action\r\n  the equitable defense of unclean hands is available against a plaintiff\r\n  shareholder for the purpose of defeating his derivative suit because a &quot;plaintiff\r\n  who is subject to an equitable defense should not be able to avoid that defense\r\n  by bringing suit in a representative capacity&quot;). \r\nStraight does not challenge on appeal the specific findings of the\r\n  referee that his conscious harassment of the Gosses constitutes unclean hands, or that he came into court with unclean hands in that the following actions\r\n  by Straight were unfair and inequitable: (1) putting himself in conflict of\r\n  interest by being a dominant shareholder in Timberline while controlling its\r\n  major customer, (2) causing Timberline to sue its only other customer, (3)\r\n  subordinating the interests of Timberline to those of Eagle's Nest, (4) setting\r\n  an eight percent volume rebate when Timberline's sales to Eagle's Nest were\r\n  below break-even, (5) surreptitiously recording telephone calls with Goss, (6) looting\r\n  Timberline's assets, specifically the manufacturing design plans for the round\r\n  house, and (7) threatening to move Eagle's Nest business to another builder\r\n  after causing Timberline to lose its only other customer and thereafter\r\n  conspiring and attempting to open Eagle's Nest's own manufacturing facility.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238,\r\n  241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding that an unappealed ruling is the law\r\n  of the case).\r\nFurthermore, Straight's own inequitable conduct came directly to\r\n  bear on the transactions of which Straight now complains.Â  Straight refused to\r\n  contribute his time or money to Timberline while damaging the corporation's\r\n  financial position by subordinating the interests of Timberline to those of\r\n  Eagle's Nest.Â  These actions left Timberline in no condition to either purchase\r\n  the Wickes property or form a truss company.Â  They also left the Gosses\r\n  struggling to maintain Timberline through their own contributions of time and\r\n  financial resources and resulted in their making the salary overrides and\r\n  Allied distributions.Â  Accordingly, we find the special referee did not err in\r\n  holding the doctrine of unclean hands precluded Straight from recovering\r\n  against the Gosses.Â  \r\nÂ Common Paymaster Doctrine\r\nStraight next argues the special referee erred in using the common\r\n  paymaster doctrine in regard to the payment by Timberline of CBT employees.Â \r\n  Straight asserts such a doctrine does not apply here because the two companies\r\n  were not commonly owned, but simply had &quot;interlocking ownership and\r\n  directors.&quot;Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA reading of the special referee's order shows he did not\r\n  rely on a common paymaster doctrine.Â  Rather, the referee simply noted that\r\n  Timberline and CBT essentially engaged in a &quot;common paymaster scheme&quot;\r\n  for the payment of labor, which is not an uncommon approach with related\r\n  companies.Â  The referee did not make any findings whether the common paymaster\r\n  doctrine would apply in a situation where some, but not all, of the\r\n  shareholders have two companies in common.Â  Further, there is evidence of\r\n  record that use of one payroll account for two companies may have cost-saving\r\n  benefits and is an appropriate practice.Â  Most importantly, there is evidence\r\n  to support the referee's finding that the funds paid by Timberline for CBT\r\n  labor were offset by the trusses CBT provided for Timberline, that the accounts\r\n  were reconciled at the end of each year, and that at the end of 2000,\r\n  Timberline actually owed CBT over $14,000.Â  Accordingly, there was clearly no\r\n  harm to Timberline in the employment of a common paymaster scheme under the\r\n  circumstances.\r\nMisappropriation of Corporate\r\nOpportunities\r\nFinally, Straight argues the acquisition of the Wickes property\r\n  and formation of CBT were corporate opportunities for Timberline which the\r\n  Gosses misappropriated for themselves.Â  He asserts the special referee\r\n  improperly relied on his conclusion that Timberline was financially incapable\r\n  of taking advantage of the opportunities presented because Timberline would\r\n  have had the funds available had the Gosses not removed them through the\r\n  improper Allied and salary override payments.Â  He further maintains CBT used\r\n  Timberline to &quot;bankroll&quot; itself, and used Timberline employees,\r\n  material and rent to nourish CBT.Â  He thus contends the use of Timberline\r\n  assets during a decline in business, along with the monies removed by the\r\n  Gosses, resulted in the demise of Timberline but the success and survival of\r\n  CBT, which ultimately evolved into Structural Component Systems.Â  Accordingly, Straight claims the Gosses should be ordered to return Structural Component\r\n  Systems and the Wickes property to Timberline, or the court should impose a\r\n  constructive trust in favor of Timberline on these assets.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A constructive trust results 'when circumstances under which\r\n  property was acquired make it inequitable that it be retained by the one\r\n  holding legal title.Â  These circumstances include fraud, bad faith, abuse of\r\n  confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation\r\n  in equity to make restitution.'&quot;Â  Macaulay v. Wachovia Bank of S.C.,\r\n    N.A., 351 S.C. 287, 294, 569 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Hendrix\r\n      v. Hendrix, 299 S.C. 233, 235, 383 S.E.2d 468, 469 (Ct. App. 1989)).Â  &quot;A\r\n  constructive trust 'arises entirely by operation of law without reference to\r\n  any actual or supposed intentions of creating a trust.'&quot;Â  Smith v.\r\n    S.C.Â  Ret.Â  Sys., 336 S.C. 505, 529, 520 S.E.2d 339, 352 (Ct.

Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 356, 499 S.E.2d 488, 501 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998)).Â  \r\n\r\n  In general, a constructive trust may be\r\n    imposed when a party obtains a benefit &quot;which does not equitably belong to\r\n    him and which he cannot in good conscience retain or withhold from another who\r\n    is beneficially entitled to it as where money has been paid by accident,\r\n    mistake of fact, or fraud, or has been acquired through a breach of trust or\r\n    the violation of a fiduciary duty.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\nId. (quoting SSI Medical Servs., Inc. v.\r\n  Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793-94 (1990)).Â Â  \r\nAs previously stated, the evidence of record supports the Gosses'\r\n  actions when considered in conjunction with those of Straight.Â  There is\r\n  evidence Straight consistently insisted on the distribution of Timberline\r\n  profits, insisted Timberline engage in an expensive lawsuit with Timberline's\r\n  only other customer, refused to invest any further funds beyond his nominal\r\n  initial investment and short term loan, refused to guarantee any loans, which\r\n  would have been necessary for Timberline to purchase any property or begin its\r\n  own truss business, and agreed Goss was to receive distributions through Allied\r\n  to level out the benefits he received by way of the American Accent legal fees\r\n  and the special discounts.Â  Further, the evidence suggests Straight was not\r\n  concerned with Timberline's profit, but only that of Eagle's Nest, and that\r\n  selling &quot;dealerships&quot; was much more profitable to Eagle's Nest than\r\n  selling the panelized houses manufactured by Timberline.Â  Thus, it is no\r\n  surprise that the number of houses produced by Timberline for Eagle's Nest\r\n  decreased dramatically over the years.Â  This, along with Straight's constant\r\n  battle with Goss over the Timberline price increases and his failure to follow\r\n  the agreed upon pricing model, inevitably contributed to the severe financial\r\n  problems and ultimate demise of Timberline.Â  Additionally, the evidence is\r\n  clear that Straight asserted control over Goss and Timberline by threatening to\r\n  remove Eagle's Nest business.Â  Further, the Gosses' personal venture into real\r\n  estate provided Timberline with the manufacturing facility necessary for its\r\n  survival when it could no longer stay on the previously leased premises nor\r\n  locate another available and appropriate space and did not have the financial\r\n  capability to purchase its own facility.Â  As well, Timberline did not have the\r\n  financial means to begin its own truss business, yet benefited from the\r\n  arrangement with CBT, obtaining faster custom quotes and delivery, cheaper\r\n  prices, and free delivery.\r\nReviewing the evidence in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, we agree with the referee that there was no\r\n  misappropriation of corporate opportunities of Timberline by the Gosses, and to\r\n  invoke a constructive trust as requested by Straight is entirely inappropriate\r\n  under the circumstances presented.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the special referee's order is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both\r\n  Goss and Gandolfi had\r\nengineering backgrounds.Â  Goss testified he designed the round houses.Â  \r\n[2] At some point, Straight acquired Gandolfi's\r\n  shares in Timberline and the company bought Chester's shares, resulting in\r\n  Straight owning fifty percent of Timberline and Goss and Pam together owning\r\nthe remaining fifty percent.Â  \r\n[3] The only other evidence of Timberline producing homes\r\n  for other customers is that it manufactured about four panelized packages for\r\n  some localÂ  individuals as well as one for Goss and one for a Timberline\r\nemployee.Â  \r\n[4] It appears that Straight felt he was &quot;duped&quot;\r\n  by Gandolfi when Gandolfi talked him into selling Helms his shares in American\r\n  Accent, but Gandolfi, who was also supposedly selling his shares, either\r\n  repurchased those shares or negated the transaction in order for Helms and\r\n  Gandolfi to shut Straight out of American Accents.Â Â Â  Goss testified American\r\n  Accent and Eagle's Nest had the same marketing approach, Straight wanted\r\n  American Accent out of that market, and Straight told Goss he wanted to &quot;squash&quot;\r\n  American Accent and he was going to &quot;crush&quot; them because American\r\n  Accent was competing with Eagle's Nest. Â Because American Accent had an\r\n  agreement with Timberline that it would buy houses exclusively from Timberline,\r\n  Straight believed Timberline could initiate a lawsuit against American Accent\r\n  to enforce that agreement.Â Â Â  Straight, on the other hand, maintained that he\r\n  had an agreement drawn up between Timberline and American Accent which not only\r\n  made Timberline an exclusive provider, but also placed limitations on the\r\n  product Timberline produced for American Accent.Â  Straight contended that\r\n  American Accent violated the agreement, informing people it could make any type\r\n  of home, including the round house.Â  Â While Goss's position was that the\r\n  lawsuit was instituted solely for Straight's and Eagle's Nest's benefit,\r\n  Straight asserted it was beneficial to Timberline as well.Â  This lawsuit started around 1994 and ended\r\n  in 1995 or 1996.Â  \r\n[5] The order of the referee notes that in December 1998,\r\nthe board reduced the override to three percent of sales. \r\n[6] It is of further interest to note Goss testified\r\n  this start-up capital of $25,000 contributed by Straight and Gandolfi was paid\r\n  for by Eagle's Nest, whereby that company paid for a house manufactured by\r\n  Kingsberry twice, paying Kingsberry for the home and then issuing a $25,000\r\n  check to Timberline for the same home, in order to improperly deduct the\r\nexpense of their capital contribution.Â  \r\n[7] When Timberline ultimately ceased production, it was\r\n  still obligated on a $150,000 note.Â  After selling some land owned by\r\n  Timberline to pay down the note, a balance of approximately $85,000 remained,\r\n  which the Gosses were forced to assume as they had personally guaranteed the\r\nnote.Â  \r\n[8] Straight also summarily asserts the referee further\r\n  erred in applying the business judgment rule to these transactions, as such a\r\n  rule is not applicable to conflict of interest transactions.Â  A reading of the\r\n  referee's order discloses, however, that the referee did not reference this\r\n  rule in regard to Straight's claims that the land purchase and truss business\r\n  transactions were conflicts of interest, but rather did so in regard to\r\nStraight's assertions of negligent mismanagement of Timberline.Â  \r\n[9] Goss testified about what he learned over time\r\n  in regard to these dealerships sold by Eagle's Nest.Â  When Timberline first\r\n  started, Eagle's Nest was charging $3,000 for a dealership, which was\r\n  essentially the right to sell a panelized house.Â  By the end, the price of a\r\n  dealership had risen to $10,000.Â  Goss stated that Eagle's Nest would have\r\n  three to four hundred dealers, whom they called reps, who made $8,000 to\r\n  $10,000 a year in nonrefundable deposits.Â  The person only had three to four\r\n  months time from the date of deposit to have the house shipped.Â  Because it was\r\n  almost impossible for these dealers, for whom there was no required specialized\r\n  training, to make the necessary preparations for delivery, which included\r\n  obtaining financing, finding land, choosing the style of home, and putting in a\r\n  foundation, only fifty to seventy-five of these reps would actually take a\r\n  home.Â  The remainder would lose their deposits, which became nonrefundable\r\n  revenue for Eagle's Nest.Â  Goss testified to a particular meeting he attended\r\n  with some of the potential reps wherein he began to explain what needed to be\r\n  taken care of before a house arrived.Â  He was interrupted by an Eagle's Nest\r\n  employee who told the attendees their only responsibility was &quot;to bring\r\n  coffee and donuts.&quot;Â  When Goss confronted Straight about selling such a\r\n  complicated product to people and indicating there was such little work\r\n  involved, Straight informed him that he was not in the business of selling\r\n  panelized houses, but was in the &quot;business of business,&quot; and he did\r\nnot care if Eagle's Nest ever sold a house.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n[10]Straight summarily asserts Timberline is the real\r\n  party in interest.Â  However, in his order the special referee noted from the outset, although this action is ostensibly\r\n  for the benefit of Timberline, as a practical matter the only beneficiary of\r\n  the lawsuit would be the only shareholder who is not an officer or director,\r\nStraight.Â  Straight does not challenge this finding.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4533","title":"Posner v.

Â Husband failed to appear for the hearing pursuant to the Rule\r\n  to Show Cause.Â  Wife argues because Husband has failed to purge himself of this\r\n  contempt, his appeal to this Court should be dismissed under the FDD.[2]Â \r\n  The second event is the February 21, 2006, distribution of Husband's TDSP by\r\n  IBM, which the family court held was in accordance with the terms of the\r\n  Agreement and the QDRO.Â  Husband argues the family court's interpretation of\r\n  the Agreement and the QDRO as it related to distribution of the TDSP was\r\n  erroneous.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contempt\r\n  Order\r\nOn\r\n  July 20, 2004, the family court found Husband in contempt for failing to comply\r\n  with certain terms of the Agreement.Â  Specifically, the family court found\r\n  Husband in contempt, stating Husband failed (a) to maintain life insurance\r\n  designating Wife as beneficiary for the benefit of the Children, (b) to restore\r\n  the balance of certain UGMA accounts for the Children, (c) to reimburse Wife\r\n  for health insurance premiums and other medical costs incurred by Wife for the\r\n  Children, and (d) to provide Wife with information or authorization to access\r\n  information regarding Husband's IBM stock cost basis.Â  The family court further\r\n  ordered a bench warrant be issued directing Husband's arrest and incarceration\r\n  due to his failure to appear pursuant to the Rule to Show Cause for the hearing.Â \r\n  The family court ordered Husband be incarcerated for 90 days, but that he could\r\n  purge himself of the contempt by complying with the order.Â  A bench warrant was\r\n  issued for Husband's arrest on July 22, 2004.Â  \r\nThree\r\n  years later, on March 15, 2007, a hearing was held on Husband's motion\r\n  requesting the family court reform, interpret, or enforce the QDRO in a manner\r\n  consistent with the Agreement.Â  At that hearing, Wife argued Husband's motion\r\n  should be barred under the FDD because Husband had yet to comply with the\r\n  Contempt Order.Â  Following the hearing, the family court issued an order\r\n  stating although it had considered Wife's argument concerning the FDD, the\r\n  family court nevertheless determined it &quot;would be best for it to address\r\n  the merits of [Husband's] Motion.&quot;Â  The family court went on to find that\r\n  Husband had failed to purge himself of his contempt under the Contempt Order.Â \r\n  The court held, &quot;Much of the same documentation presented at [the] hearing\r\n  was also presented earlier to Judge Riddle and was found to be inaccurate,\r\n  non-complying and otherwise insufficient to serve to purge [Husband] of the\r\n  prior contempt sentences.&quot; Â Husband did not appear at this hearing.Â  The\r\n  July 22, 2004 bench warrant is still outstanding.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribution of\r\n  the TDSP\r\nThe\r\n  QDRO was issued and filed in January 2006. Â On February 21, 2006, IBM\r\n  distributed the TDSP by transferring $203,590.12 to Wife and $135,349.10 to\r\n  Husband.Â  Thereafter, Husband filed a motion in family court requesting that the\r\n  court reform, interpret, or enforce the QDRO in a manner consistent with the\r\n  Agreement.Â  Wife, in turn, submitted an amended return, answer and counterclaim\r\n  to Husband's motion in which she asserted IBM had interpreted the QDRO\r\n  correctly in its distribution and alleged Husband had not purged himself of the\r\n  family court's finding of civil contempt almost three years earlier.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court held Husband and Wife received their proper distribution under the\r\n  QDRO and that, contrary to Husband's contentions, Wife was not overpaid.Â  The\r\n  family court also awarded Wife $5,000 in attorneys' fees and costs.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302,\r\n  307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149-50 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that\r\n  the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623\r\n  (2003).Â  However, our broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of\r\n  the burden of convincing this Court that the family court committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi,\r\n  364 S.C. at 190, 612 S.E.2d at 711.\r\nLAW &amp; ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Husband's Contempt \r\nHusband\r\n  argues he has performed the acts specified in the Contempt Order, thereby\r\n  purging his contempt and, therefore, it was error for the family court to find that\r\n  he remains in contempt.Â  In contrast, Wife argues the family court properly\r\n  held that Husband remains in contempt and, therefore, his appeal should be\r\n  dismissed under the FDD.Â  We must, therefore, first determine whether the\r\n  family court erred in holding Husband has failed to purge himself of contempt.Â \r\n  We hold it did not.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if it is without\r\n  evidentiary support or the family court has abused its discretion.Â  Lukich\r\n    v. Lukich, 368 S.C. 47, 56, 627 S.E.2d 754, 759 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The\r\n  purpose of holding an individual in civil contempt is &quot;to coerce that\r\n  individual to do the thing required by the order for the benefit of the\r\n  complainant.&quot;Â  Miller v. Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 456, 652 S.E.2d 754,\r\n  761 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 75, 615 S.E.2d\r\n  465, 475 (Ct. App. 2005)).Â  &quot;In civil contempt cases, the sanctions are\r\n  conditioned on compliance with the court's order. . . . [T]he contemnor can end\r\n  the sentence and discharge himself at any moment by doing what he had\r\n  previously refused to do.&quot;Â  Id. at 457, 652 S.E.2d at 761.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the Contempt Order found Husband in contempt on several grounds, among which was\r\n  his failure to replenish the UGMA accounts for the Children.Â  Further, he\r\n  failed to appear before the family court pursuant to a Rule to Show Cause,\r\n  resulting in a bench warrant being issued for his arrest.\r\n\r\n  i.&nbsp;&nbsp; UGMA\r\n    Accounts\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Contempt Order stated Husband could purge his contempt as to the UGMA accounts by\r\n  providing written proof that he redeposited $24,588, plus 8% interest, from\r\n  July 30, 1998, until the date of the redeposit within the time limits specified\r\n  by the Agreement. Â \r\nAs\r\n  proof that he replenished the UGMA accounts, Husband points to two exhibits in\r\n  the record.Â  The first is a July 28, 2004 letter from Husband's then attorney\r\n  to Wife's attorney purporting to show a breakdown of the UGMA account from July\r\n  to December 2001, as well as all of 2002 and 2003.Â  However, this letter states\r\n  that the &quot;[t]otal deposited&quot; on the account during this period was\r\n  only $7,953.09, not $24,588 as was required by the Contempt Order.Â  The letter\r\n  also references an &quot;enclosed&quot; account summary, but we find no such\r\n  summary in the record.Â  The second is a plain piece of paper entitled &quot;Rationalization\r\n  of [A]ccount Transactions for UGMA.&quot;Â  This paper purports to show that\r\n  Husband has redeposited $24,372.86 to the UGMA account.Â  However, this document\r\n  does not indicate who created it, when it was created, or for what purpose.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  there is no documentation in the record from the UGMA account to corroborate\r\n  deposits claimed by Husband.Â  Taken together, we do not find these exhibits\r\n  serve as sufficient written proof that Husband has complied with the provisions\r\n  of the Contempt Order dealing with the UGMA accounts.Â  At best, they provide conflicting\r\n  evidence as to exactly how much Husband has redeposited.\r\nThe\r\n  family court also found the other documentation Husband submitted as proof that\r\n  he had complied with the Contempt Order to be insufficient.Â  After review of\r\n  this evidence, we find no abuse of discretion in the family court's conclusion\r\n  as to Husband's non-compliance.\r\n\r\n  ii. Bench\r\n    Warrant\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Contempt Order also stated Husband was in contempt for his willful failure to\r\n  appear before the family court as required by the Rule to Show Cause and a\r\n  bench warrant was to be issued for Husband's arrest.Â  This sanction was\r\n  reserved until Husband appeared before the family court pursuant to the bench\r\n  warrant.Â  Husband has yet to appear before the family court to be sentenced for\r\n  his prior failure to appear.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; The FDD\r\nBecause\r\n  we find Husband has failed to purge himself of contempt, we must next determine\r\n  whether the FDD can be applied to dismiss his case.\r\nThe FDD is a\r\n  discretionary right of an appellate court to &quot;dismiss an appeal by a\r\n  person who stands in contempt of court in the proceeding in which he seeks to\r\n  take an appeal.&quot; Â See Scelba, 342 S.C. at 228, 535 S.E.2d at\r\n  671 (describing the doctrine as an inherent power of the court &quot;to ignore\r\n  the demands of litigants who persist in defying the legal orders and\r\n  processes&quot;).Â  This power of the court has long been recognized by the\r\n  United States Supreme Court.Â  Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507\r\n  U.S. 234, 239 (1993).Â  The rationales for this doctrine include: (1) the\r\n  difficulty of enforcement against one not willing to subject himself to the\r\n  court's authority, (2) the inequity of allowing the &quot;fugitive&quot; to use\r\n  the resources of the courts only if the outcome is an aid to him, (3) the need\r\n  to avoid prejudice to the non-fugitive party, and (4) the discouragement of\r\n  flights from justice.Â  Scelba, 342 S.C. at 228-29, 535 S.E.2d at 671.Â \r\n  For an appellate court to invoke the FDD to dismiss an appeal, two requirements\r\n  must be met: (1) the appellant must be a fugitive; and (2) there must be a\r\n  connection between the appellant's fugitive status and the appellate process\r\n  the appellant seeks to utilize.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Scelba,\r\n  this Court applied the FDD to dismiss the appeal of a wife due to her\r\n  &quot;flagrant disregard of prior orders in [the] litigation.&quot;Â  Id. at 232, 535 S.E.2d at 673.Â  In that case, the husband moved for a divorce on the\r\n  ground of adultery.Â  Id. at 226, 535 S.E.2d at 670.Â  At a temporary\r\n  hearing, the family court ordered the parties to account to each other for all\r\n  property and ordered the wife to surrender certain items and pay the husband's\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  Id.Â  The wife refused to allow her husband to enter\r\n  the family home to inventory and appraise the property, so the husband\r\n  requested a Rule to Show Cause against the wife.Â  Id.Â  The wife refused\r\n  to attend the hearing and was held in contempt.Â  Id. at 227, 535 S.E.2d\r\n  at 670.Â  In its final order, the family court granted the divorce, divided the\r\n  marital property, and ordered the wife to pay the husband's attorney's fees.Â  Id. at 227-28, 535 S.E.2d at 671.Â  The wife appealed all three issues.Â  Id.Â \r\n  This Court dismissed the wife's appeal under the FDD because the wife had been\r\n  found in contempt for failing to appear at a rule to show cause hearing, failing\r\n  to appear at a scheduled deposition, and failing to appear at a final hearing\r\n  for fear of being arrested on the bench warrant.Â  Id. at 229, 535 S.E.2d\r\n  at 671-72.Â  \r\nWe find that\r\n  here, as in Scelba, the requirements of the FDD are met.Â  First, Husband\r\n  is a fugitive in this litigation.Â  The family court found Husband in contempt for\r\n  failing to comply with a number of provisions in the Agreement.Â  Moreover, since\r\n  the issuance of the bench warrant by the family court, Husband has yet to\r\n  appear before that court.Â  As such, &quot;matters giving rise to the bench\r\n  warrant have not been adjudicated because of [Husband's] refusal to submit to\r\n  the family court's jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Id. at 229, 535 S.E.2d at 672.\r\nSecond, there exists\r\n  a sufficient nexus between Husband's fugitive status and the appellate process\r\n  he seeks to utilize.Â  In Huskey v. Huskey, this Court found a sufficient\r\n  nexus existed and thus refused to hear a husband's appeal of an equitable\r\n  division of marital property.Â  Â 284 S.C. 504, 505, 327 S.E.2d 359, 360 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1985).Â  In that case, the husband absconded from the family court's\r\n  jurisdiction to avoid arrest for failure to appear in connection with a\r\n  contempt proceeding arising from the divorce but concerning matters outside the\r\n  property division.Â  Id.\r\nHere, the nexus\r\n  is even stronger than in Huskey.Â  Husband's fugitive status derives from\r\n  not only his failure to appear before the family court pursuant to the Rule to\r\n  Show Cause resulting in a bench warrant being issued for his arrest, but also his\r\n  failure to comply with the provisions of the Agreement itself.Â  On appeal, Husband\r\n  asks this Court to interpret the Agreement in a manner more favorable to him\r\n  than the family court's interpretation.Â  Husband has failed to abide by the\r\n  court order which approves the Agreement, absented himself from the\r\n  jurisdiction, and evaded the processes of the court.Â  In short, his conduct\r\n  frustrates the administration of justice.Â  We hold that under the FDD Husband\r\n  may not use the resources of this Court in this manner.Â  See Scelba,\r\n  342 S.C. at 229, 535 S.E.2d 671 (holding one of the rationales behind the FDD\r\n  is to prevent an appellant from &quot;us[ing] the resources of the courts only if\r\n  the outcome is an aid to him&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Husband's appeal is \r\nDISMISSED.\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Uniform Gifts\r\n  to Minors Act.\r\n[2] The Fugitive\r\n  Disentitlement Doctrine permits a court to &quot;dismiss an appeal by a person\r\n  who stands in contempt of court in the proceeding in which he seeks to take an\r\n  appeal.&quot;Â  Scelba v. Scelba, 342 S.C. 223, 228, 535 S.E.2d 668, 671\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4534","title":"State v.

Carter, of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Kevin Scott Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J.: The State\r\n  appeals concurrent sentences imposed by the trial court on Eric Spratt following his convictions for trafficking\r\n  in crack cocaine and for possession of marijuana.Â  The State contends the trial court erred in not permitting\r\n    an uncounseled 1998 guilty plea to possession of cocaine to be used for\r\n    sentence enhancement without first determining whether Spratt waived his right to\r\n    counsel at that time.Â  We agree and remand.\r\nThe\r\n  Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit a\r\n  prior uncounseled conviction resulting in a sentence of imprisonment from being\r\n  used to enhance the punishment for a subsequent conviction.[1]Â \r\n  In State v. Payne, this court concluded the defendant bears the burden\r\n  of proof when collaterally attacking a prior conviction the State seeks to use\r\n  for sentence enhancement.[2]Â \r\n  This court based its decision, at least in part, on the presumption of regularity\r\n  given to final judgments.[3]Â \r\n  Once the State has proven the prior conviction, the defendant must prove it is\r\n  constitutionally defective or otherwise invalid by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.[4]Â  \r\nA\r\n  prior uncounseled conviction is not constitutionally defective or invalid when\r\n  the defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to\r\n  counsel.[5]Â \r\n  Further, courts in other jurisdictions have held the trial court may consider\r\n  prior uncounseled convictions as a basis for sentence enhancement when the\r\n  defendant validly waived his right to counsel.[6]\r\nHere, the trial\r\n  court did not consider evidence concerning whether Spratt waived his right to\r\n  counsel during his prior uncounseled guilty plea hearing.Â  In fact, the trial\r\n  court stated &quot;the issue [is not] whether or not\r\n  [Spratt waived] his right to counsel. . . . The question is whether or not an\r\n  uncounseled guilty plea can be used for sentence enhancement purposes.&quot; \r\nAccordingly, we reverse and remand this case to the trial court\r\n  and direct the trial court to reevaluate Spratt's sentence after considering\r\n  evidence regarding whether Spratt waived his right to counsel during his prior\r\n  uncounseled guilty plea hearing. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] State v.

Â On March 23, 2008, Mother brought this action in the\r\n  Aiken County Family Court seeking registration in South Carolina of the Georgia\r\n  divorce decree and custody order and modification of the custody and visitation\r\n  provisions of the order.Â  In her complaint, Mother asserted she currently\r\n  resided in Florida, Father resided in South Carolina, and Child resided with\r\n  Father's parents, who lived in Aiken County, South Carolina.Â  Mother sought\r\n  custody of Child and, in the alternative, removal of the supervision\r\n  restrictions on her visitation privileges.\r\nOn\r\n  April 9, 2008, Father answered and counterclaimed, requesting among other\r\n  relief that the action be dismissed because &quot;[t]he child and parents still\r\n  have significant connections with the State of Georgia and substantial evidence\r\n  relating to the child's care, protection, training and personal relationships\r\n  are in the State of Georgia.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  family court held a hearing in the matter on April 15, 2008.Â  By order dated\r\n  May 7, 2008, and filed May 8, 2008, the family court denied Mother's motion for\r\n  registration and modification of the Georgia order and granted Father's motion\r\n  to dismiss the action.Â  Mother appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\nMother first\r\n  argues the family court, in declining to exercise jurisdiction over this\r\n  matter, placed undue emphasis on evidence that Father was domiciled in Georgia\r\n  and improperly ignored evidence that Father and Child now resided in South\r\n  Carolina.Â  We agree with Mother that Father's domicile was not relevant to a\r\n  determination of jurisdiction; however, we uphold the family court's dismissal\r\n  of this action based on its finding that Father has remained a resident of Georgia.\r\nUnder\r\n  the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (the Act), which\r\n  took effect in this State on June 8, 2007, a South Carolina family court,\r\n  except in certain situations not applicable here, may not modify a custody\r\n  order issued by a court of another state unless a court of this State has\r\n  jurisdiction to make an initial custody determination under the Act and (1) the court of the issuing state determines either that it no longer has\r\n  continuing jurisdiction or that a court of this State would be a more\r\n  convenient forum; or (2) either a South Carolina court or a court of the\r\n  issuing state determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person\r\n  acting as a parent do not presently reside in the issuing state.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-15-334 (formerly S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6034) (Supp. 2007 and 2008).[2]Â  \r\nThere\r\n  appears to be no dispute in the present case that a South Carolina family court\r\n  could exercise jurisdiction to make an initial custody determination.Â  Both\r\n  Father and Child have continuously resided in South Carolina for several years\r\n  preceding the filing of this lawsuit.Â  Furthermore, there is no indication in\r\n  the record before us that a Georgia court has ruled whether or not Georgia has\r\n  continuing jurisdiction over the matter, whether or not South Carolina would be\r\n  a more convenient forum, or whether or not anyone connected with the matter\r\n  presently resides in Georgia.Â  The only question here is whether the South\r\n  Carolina family court correctly found that Father, notwithstanding significant\r\n  evidence that he currently resided in South Carolina, was still a resident of\r\n  Georgia as well.Â  We hold the family court's determination was correct.[3]\r\n&quot;\r\n  '[R]esidence' is a more elastic and flexible term than domicile or\r\n  citizenship.Â  A person may have only one domicile, but may have several\r\n  residences.&quot;Â  Cook v. Fed. Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 575, 582, 211 S.E.2d\r\n  881, 884 (1975). Â Although there are no cases as yet from this jurisdiction\r\n  that expressly define the phrase &quot;presently reside&quot; as that language\r\n  is used in the Act, we do not believe the legislature intended that this term\r\n  apply only to those situations in which all parties to the dispute are\r\n  physically present within the borders of the state whose jurisdiction is at\r\n  issue.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-15-330(C) (formerly S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-6030(C)) (Supp. 2007 and 2008) (&quot;Physical presence of, or personal\r\n  jurisdiction over, a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a\r\n  child custody determination.&quot;).\r\nBased\r\n  on our review of the record, we hold there is sufficient evidence to support\r\n  the family court's determination that Father has remained a resident of Georgia\r\n  during this litigation.Â  He owns real estate in Georgia, where he is also\r\n  registered to vote.Â  Furthermore, he continues to hold a Georgia driver's\r\n  license, is paid by the United States Defense and Accounting Office as a\r\n  Georgia resident, and files his income taxes listing Georgia as his state of\r\n  residence.Â  In addition, as evidenced by a statement from the registrar of the\r\n  Medical College of Georgia, Father is enrolled as a full-time student and\r\n  expects to receive his Doctor of Medicine degree on May 8, 2009.Â  Also\r\n  significant is the fact that, although on his student loan application Father\r\n  stated his &quot;permanent city&quot; was North Augusta, South Carolina, he listed\r\n  Georgia as his state of legal residence.\r\nFinally,\r\n  we are mindful of the long-standing deference courts of this State have &quot;given\r\n  to the jurisdiction of the state that initially rules on a custody matter.&quot;Â  Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 87, 620 S.E.2d 333, 339-40 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005), vacated in part on other grounds, 375 S.C. 427, 653 S.E.2d\r\n  276 (2007); see also Clay v. Burckle, 369 S.C. 651, 658, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 173, 177 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that because the state that issued the\r\n  initial custody order properly continued to exercise jurisdiction in the\r\n  matter, South Carolina lacked authority to modify the custody decision); Sinclair\r\n    v. Albrecht, 287 S.C. 20, 23, 336 S.E.2d 485, 487 (Ct. App. 1985) (&quot;Although\r\n  more than one state may meet these jurisdictional requirements, once a custody\r\n  decree has been entered, the continuing jurisdiction of the decree state is\r\n  exclusive.&quot;).Â  In our view, the enactment of the Act in this State has\r\n  only enhanced this deference because now modification of a custody decision\r\n  from another jurisdiction can occur only upon the satisfaction of certain\r\n  specified conditions.Â  \r\nII. Convenience of the\r\n  Forum\r\nMother\r\n  next argues the family court erred in finding that Georgia is the more\r\n  convenient forum to litigate this dispute and, in so doing, incorrectly\r\n  determined that Georgia should retain jurisdiction in the matter.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  section 63-15-342 of theÂ  South Carolina Code, &quot;[a] court of this State,\r\n  which has jurisdiction under this article to make a child custody\r\n  determination, may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it\r\n  determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a\r\n  court of another state is a more appropriate forum.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-15-342)(A) (formerly Â§ 20-7-6042(A)) (Supp. 2007 and 2008).\r\nAssuming\r\n  without deciding that South Carolina had jurisdiction under the Act to\r\n  adjudicate this matter, we hold the family court acted within its discretion in\r\n  declining to exercise this jurisdiction based on a finding that Georgia was the\r\n  more convenient forum.Â  See Charest v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511,\r\n  516, 495 S.E.2d 784, 786 (Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;The family court in its discretion may enter an order\r\n  declining to exercise jurisdiction based on a finding that it is an\r\n  inconvenient forum, which this Court will uphold absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.&quot;).Â  All the prior litigation in this case took place in\r\n  Georgia, and it appears undisputed that the Georgia court continues to monitor\r\n  Mother's child support obligation.Â  Furthermore, as Mother admitted in her\r\n  affidavit, many of her visits with Child now take place in Georgia.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on our determination that Father has remained a Georgia resident throughout\r\n  this litigation, we affirm the family court's ruling that Georgia should retain\r\n  jurisdiction over this matter.Â  We further hold the family court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in finding Georgia was the more convenient forum to litigate\r\n  this dispute.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Georgia adopted the Uniform Child Custody\r\n  Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act in 2001.Â  See Hall v. Wellborn,\r\n  673 S.E.2d 341, 342 (Ga. Ct. App. 2009).\r\n[3]Â  We recognize the family court attempted to justify\r\n  its ruling by making several references to Father's status as a Georgia\r\n  domicile; however, the court also specifically found Father &quot;has not\r\n  abandoned his residency in the State of Georgia.&quot;Â  Although the court may\r\n  have erroneously equated the concepts of residence and domicile, we believe the\r\n  appealed order had sufficient findings of fact to the effect that Father, for\r\n  purposes of the Act, presently resided in Georgia. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4536","title":"Gibson v.

Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005).[1]Â  We\r\n  reverse. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\nHISTORY\r\nGibson is the personal representative of\r\n  the Estate of Georgia F. Mitchell.Â  Mitchell died on November 19, 2000, at the\r\n  age of ninety-two. Â Prior to her death, Mitchell maintained an interest-bearing\r\n  checking account and a money market account at BOA's banking center on Parker Road in Florissant, Missouri.Â  Both accounts were joint accounts co-owned by Mitchell\r\n  and her best friend, Lucille Gilda.Â  From November 16, 1999 through March 28, 2000, sixteen unexplained withdrawals from Mitchell's account occurred.Â  During\r\n  this time period, Mitchell relocated from Missouri to Cheraw, South Carolina on\r\n  January 22, 2000 to live with Gibson, the widow of Mitchell's nephew.Â  Within a\r\n  few weeks after Mitchell's arrival in South Carolina, Gibson contacted her\r\n  estate planning attorney to inquire about estate planning services for Mitchell,\r\n  who was very affluent.Â  As a result of his meeting with Mitchell, the attorney\r\n  prepared a trust, will, and power of attorney for Mitchell.Â  Gibson was named\r\n  as the trustee of Mitchell's trust and Gibson's children were named as\r\n  beneficiaries of Mitchell's will.Â  Â Â \r\nMitchell received statements for her BOA\r\n  accounts for the months ending February 7, 2000 and June 9, 2000.[2]Â \r\n  The February 7 statement showed a balance of $43,961.37 for the money market\r\n  account and a balance of $25,526.97 for the checking account.Â  The June 9\r\n  statement showed an approximate balance of $1,288.53 for the money market\r\n  account and a balance of $20,537.99 for the checking account.[3]Â \r\n  Thus, the combined depletion of the money market and checking accounts from\r\n  February 7, 2000 to June 9, 2000 totaled $47,661.82. Â The statements for the\r\n  intervening months, which showed the last six unexplained withdrawals, were\r\n  held at the Parker Road banking center at the direction of the center's\r\n  manager, Victoria Gan.Â  According to Gan's deposition testimony, she had asked\r\n  another BOA employee working in the statements department to send Mitchell's\r\n  account statements to Gan's attention at the Parker Road banking center because\r\n  Lucille Gilda had requested that the statements be held at the bank due to mail\r\n  security concerns.Â  Gan also testified that she mailed those statements to\r\n  Mitchell at her South Carolina address in May 2000.Â  After Mitchell had an\r\n  opportunity to go through her mail, Gibson forwarded Mitchell's BOA statements\r\n  to Gibson's daughter, Elizabeth Chanter, who was a certified public accountant.\r\n  Â Chanter did not review those statements at that time.Â  \r\nGan acted as the teller for virtually all\r\n  of the sixteen unexplained withdrawals, and most of those withdrawals were in\r\n  amounts of $5,000 or $10,000.Â  According to Gan's testimony, after Mitchell\r\n  relocated to South Carolina, she wrote a letter to Gan requesting that Gan mail\r\n  to her four cashier's checks in the amount of $10,000 each.Â  That letter has\r\n  never been produced.Â  Gan also testified that after she mailed the checks, Mitchell\r\n  showed up at the Parker Road banking center on March 8, 10, and 15,\r\n  respectively, to cash three of those checks and that Mitchell also appeared\r\n  for all of the other unexplained withdrawals that Gan handled from November\r\n  1999 through March 2000.Â \r\n  However, Gibson disputed Gan's testimony and presented evidence that Mitchell\r\n  was in South Carolina on the dates in question.Â  Notably, Gibson presented\r\n  evidence of Mitchell's execution of her will on the afternoon of March 15, 2000,\r\n  in her attorney's office in South Carolina.Â Â  Â \r\nAfter Mitchell's death, several\r\n  charities filed a petition in the Chesterfield County Probate Court to contest\r\n  Mitchell's will.Â  As a result of that litigation, in June 2002, BOA sent to\r\n  Gibson several subpoenaed documents pertaining to Mitchell's accounts at the Parker Road banking center.Â  Gibson gave the documents to Elizabeth Chanter to review.Â  Upon\r\n  reviewing the monthly statements for the first time, Chanter noticed the\r\n  unexplained withdrawals, and, in July 2002, she prepared a chart summarizing\r\n  the withdrawals.Â  In October 2002, through counsel, Gibson finally contacted\r\n  BOA to inquire about the withdrawals.Â  \r\nOn September 26, 2003, Gibson filed the instant action against BOA, asserting causes of action for negligence,\r\n  conversion, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  BOA later sought\r\n  leave to file a third-party complaint against Victoria Gan on the theory that\r\n  Gan may have participated in the unexplained withdrawals without BOA's\r\n  knowledge or approval.Â  Gan\r\n  was suspected of embezzling funds from Mitchell's accounts through the unexplained\r\n  withdrawals.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied the motion to file a third-party complaint but granted BOA's\r\n  motion for summary judgment on Gibson's emotional distress claim.Â  The trial\r\n  court also ruled that Gibson's complaint stated a claim for common law conversion\r\n  in addition to statutory conversion.Â  \r\nAt trial, BOA made a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict on several grounds, including the preclusion of Gibson's\r\n  claims by the three-year statute of limitations for tort actions, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-3-530(5) (2005).Â \r\n  The trial court granted BOA's directed verdict motion on all causes of action\r\n  as they related to the ten unexplained withdrawals that occurred before\r\n  Mitchell's relocation to South Carolina. Â The trial court based this ruling on\r\n  the ground that the corresponding bank statements were mailed to Mitchell at\r\n  her Missouri address, providing her with notice of the withdrawals within just\r\n  a few weeks and, thus, the statute of limitations barred Gibson's claims as to\r\n  those particular withdrawals.Â  As to the remaining six unexplained withdrawals,\r\n  the trial court denied BOA's directed verdict motion on the negligence and\r\n  common law conversion claims, concluding that whether the February 7, 2000 and June 9, 2000 account statements placed Mitchell on notice that she had a claim against BOA\r\n  was a question of fact for the jury.Â  The trial court granted BOA's directed\r\n  verdict motion as to Gibson's statutory conversion claim.Â  Â Â \r\nThe jury returned a verdict against BOA\r\n  on the negligence claim for $55,510.18 in actual damages and $40,000 in\r\n  punitive damages.Â  The jury returned a verdict for BOA on Gibson's common law\r\n  conversion claim.Â  BOA filed a motion for a JNOV, but the trial court denied\r\n  the motion.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUE ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  Was Gibson's negligence claim barred by\r\n    the statute\r\n    of limitations?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\n&quot;When reviewing\r\n  the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, this Court applies the\r\n  same standard as the trial court.&quot;Â  Gadson ex rel. Gadson v. ECO Serv.s\r\n    of S.C., Inc., 374 S.C. 171,\r\n  175, 648 S.E.2d 585, 588&nbsp;(2007). Â The Court is required to view the\r\n  evidence and inferences that\r\n  reasonably can be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.Â  Id. at 175-76, 648 S.E.2d at\r\n  588.&nbsp; The motions should be denied when the evidence yields more than one inference\r\n  or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id. at 176, 648\r\n  S.E.2d at 588. Â &quot;An appellate court will only reverse the [trial] court's ruling when\r\n  there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by\r\n  an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBOA argues that the trial court erred in denying its\r\n  motions for a directed verdict and JNOV on the ground that Gibson's negligence\r\nclaim is barred by the statute of limitations. &nbsp;We agree.\r\nThe limitations\r\n  period of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005), which is the applicable\r\n  limitations period for a negligence claim, begins to run when the plaintiff &quot;knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had\r\n  a cause of action.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005) (emphasis added).Â  In other\r\n  words, the\r\n  clock starts running when the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a\r\n  person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some claim against\r\n  another party might exist.&nbsp; Burgess v. Am. Cancer Soc'y, S.C. Div.,\r\n    Inc., 300 S.C. 182, 186, 386 S.E.2d 798, 800 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  \r\nThe standard as to when the limitations\r\n  period begins to run is objective rather than subjective.&nbsp; Burgess,\r\n  300 S.C. at 186, 386 S.E.2d at 800.Â  Therefore, the limitations period &quot;begins\r\n  to run when a person could or should have known, through the exercise of\r\n  reasonable diligence, that a cause of action might exist in his or her favor,\r\n  rather than when a person obtains actual knowledge of either the potential claim\r\n  or of the facts giving rise thereto.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\n  The exercise of reasonable diligence\r\n    means simply that an injured party must act with some promptness where the\r\n    facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and\r\n    experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim\r\n    against another party might exist. The statute of limitations begins to run\r\n    from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory\r\n    developed.\r\n\r\nGrillo v. Speedrite Products, Inc., 340 S.C. 498,\r\n  503, 532 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Snell v. Columbia Gun Exch. Inc., 276 S.C. 301,\r\n303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981)).\r\n\r\n  A key element in the reasonable\r\n    diligence test is &quot;notice.&quot; The fact that an injured party may not\r\n    comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial. . . . Under section\r\n    15-3-535, the statute of limitations is triggered not merely by knowledge of an\r\n    injury, but by knowledge of facts, diligently acquired, sufficient to put a\r\n    person on notice of the existence of a cause of action against another. Â This\r\n    is an objective, not a subjective, determination. \r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).\r\nWhen there is no conflicting evidence or\r\n  when only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the\r\n  determination of when a party knew or should have known that he or she had a\r\n  claim becomes a matter of law to be decided by the trial court.&nbsp; Cf. Johnston\r\n    v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61,\r\n  65, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1993) (finding grant of summary judgment in medical\r\n  malpractice case was proper based on statute of limitations for medical\r\n  malpractice claim because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to\r\n  the plaintiff, only one reasonable inference existed as to when the plaintiff\r\n  knew or should have known she had a claim).\r\nHere, it is disputed as to when Mitchell\r\n  or Gibson received the statements for March 2000, April 2000, and May 2000,\r\n  which showed the last six unexplained withdrawals. Â However, it is undisputed\r\n  that Mitchell received the February 2000 and June 2000 statements by mid-June\r\n  2000, and those\r\n  statements showed a depletion of the money market and checking accounts totaling\r\n  $47,661.82.[4]Â \r\n  Nonetheless, the\r\n  trial court concluded\r\n  that whether the February and June statements placed Mitchell on notice that\r\n  she had a claim against BOA was a question of fact for the jury.Â  \r\nThe evidence relevant to Mitchell's\r\n  notice of an existing claim is undisputed.Â  Mitchell and Gibson received the\r\n  February 2000 and June 2000 statements by mid-June 2000. Â Further, although Gibsonâ€™s\r\n  daughter, Elizabeth Chanter, gave her opinion as a lay witness that those\r\n  statements did not indicate that &quot;somebody's taking the money,&quot; she\r\n  did admit that if someone were reviewing those statements to determine account\r\n  balances, they would have noticed a combined depletion approximating $50,000 in\r\n  the checking and money market accounts.[5]Â \r\n  Moreover, a simple inquiry of the co-owner of these accounts, Lucille Gilda,\r\n  would have eliminated any doubt over whether she was responsible for any of the\r\n  withdrawals in question.Â  Â Â \r\nEven\r\n  when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Gibson and Mitchell,\r\n  there is only one reasonable inference as to when they knew or should have\r\n  known that they had a claim against BOAâ€”when Mitchell received the June 9\r\n  statement.Â  Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-1-201(25)\r\n  (2003) (stating that in South Carolina's version of the U.C.C., a person has\r\n  &quot;notice&quot; of a fact when (a) he has\r\n  actual knowledge of it; (b) he has received a\r\n  notice or notification of it; or (c) from all\r\n  the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason\r\nto know that it exists).Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the determination of when Mitchell or Gibson knew or should have known that they\r\n  had a claim was a matter of law, and the trial court erred in submitting the\r\n  question to the jury.Â  See Gadson, 374 S.C. at\r\n  175-76, 648 S.E.2d at 588 (holding that the court is required to view\r\n  the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party but concluding that the trial court's ruling may be reversed when\r\n  there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by\r\n  an error of law); cf. Johnston, 313 S.C. at 65,\r\n  437 S.E.2d at 47 (finding grant of summary judgment in medical malpractice case\r\n  was proper based on statute of limitations for medical malpractice claim\r\n  because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\r\n  only one reasonable inference existed as to when the plaintiff knew or should\r\n  have known she had a claim).\r\nGibson's counsel cites Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of\r\n  S.C. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd.,\r\n  246 S.C. 140, 142 S.E.2d 874&nbsp;(1965), to support the argument that receipt\r\n  of a bank statement alone is not enough to trigger the running of the statute\r\n  of limitations and that until the depositor receives the forged item for\r\n  inspection, the statute cannot begin to run.Â  However, the cited opinion does\r\n  not truly support this argument because in that case, the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court did not have the question of the adequacy of the statement alone\r\n  squarely before it.Â  Rather, the Citizens opinion actually supports\r\n  BOA's argument that Mitchell's receipt of the June 9 statement placed her on\r\n  notice that she had some type of claim.Â  The Court in Citizens quoted\r\n  with approval the following language from Kan. City Title &amp;\r\n    Trust Co. v. Fourth Natâ€™l Bank in Wichita, Kan., 10 P.2d 896, 901&nbsp;(Kan.&nbsp;1932):\r\n\r\n  [W]here\r\n    the bank renders a statement to the depositor showing him the status of his\r\n    checking account, it says to him in effect: 'This bank owes you this stated\r\n      balance, and no more.' Â Such statement may fairly be construed as a\r\n        notice that any claim the depositor may make in excess of the stated\r\n    balance would be resisted by the bank. And in view of the situation the\r\n      depositor's formal demand for a greater sum would be unnecessary to\r\n    perfect the depositor's cause of action, and likewise to set in motion the\r\n      Statute of Limitations. If this is not the legal effect of the bank's\r\n    monthly statement to its depositor, it is not apparent what function the\r\n    monthly statement performs.\r\n\r\nCitizens,\r\n  246 S.C. at 144, 142 S.E.2d at 875 (quoting Kan.\r\n    City, 10 P.2d at 901))\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, a review of the account balances in the June 9, 2000 statement would have prompted a reasonable depositor to contact BOA and, at the very least,\r\n  request BOA to send her the statements for account activity between time\r\n  periods shown on the February 7 statement and June 9 statement.Â  If, after\r\n  making a reasonable inquiry of the accounts' co-owner, Lucille Gilda, as to her\r\n  activities on the accounts between February 7 and June 9, Mitchell disagreed\r\n  with the bank's representation of what it owed her as of June 9, she was then\r\n  on notice that she had some type of claim for any perceived discrepancy, even\r\n  if she did not know the precise details behind the discrepancy.Â  See Grillo, 340 S.C. at\r\n  503, 532 S.E.2d at 3 (stating that the fact that an injured party may not\r\n  comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial and that the statute of\r\n  limitations is triggered by knowledge of facts, diligently acquired, sufficient\r\n  to put a person on notice of the existence of a claim).\r\nGibson\r\n  argues that Mitchell could have inferred that Gilda had withdrawn the money and\r\n  that, therefore, the June 9 statement's representation of the account balances\r\n  could not have placed Mitchell on notice that previous withdrawals were\r\n  unauthorized or that she might have a claim for any perceived discrepancies.Â \r\n  However, a reasonably diligent depositor would direct an inquiry to any\r\n  co-owners of the accounts to determine if their activity on the accounts did in\r\nfact account for the shortfall.\r\nMitchell\r\n  and Gibson were on notice of a claim by mid-June 2000.Â  Thus, the statute of limitations\r\n  expired by mid-June 2003.Â  Gibson did not file the instant action until September\r\n  2003.Â  As a result, Gibson's negligence claim against BOA was barred by the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  While\r\n  we find the circumstances of this case troubling, we are constrained by the\r\n  law.Â  Statutes of limitations &quot;are designed to promote\r\n  justice by forcing parties to pursue a case in a timely manner.&quot;Â  State ex\r\n    rel. Condon v. City of Columbia, 339 S.C. 8, 19, 528 S.E.2d 408, 413\r\n  (2000).Â  &quot;Parties should act before memories\r\n  dim, evidence grows stale or becomes nonexistent, or other people act in\r\n  reliance on what they believe is a settled state of public affairs.&quot;Â  Id. at 19, 528 S.E.2d at 413-14; see also Moates v. Bobb,\r\n  322 S.C. 172, 176, 470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct.

[T]hey have raised their\r\n    children here, have owned property here, have had their work careers here, have\r\n    put down roots, have made friends and have established themselves as citizens\r\n    of Charleston County[,] and if [they] were still living together and [Husband]\r\n    had lost his job, I have serious doubts they would move away just so they could\r\n    continue making the same salary . . . .\r\n  [Husband]\r\n    testified that there were no comparable jobs available in the Charleston\r\n    area[,] . . . and I find no compelling reason that [Husband] should be forced\r\n    to leave the environment he has known for 25 years to seek employment which\r\n    might pay the same as he was receiving in Charleston at his previous\r\n    employment.\r\n\r\nHusband\r\n  submitted an affidavit in support of his request for attorneys' fees and costs,\r\n  which the family court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviewing a family court order may find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Robinson v. Tyson,\r\n  319 S.C. 360, 362, 461 S.E.2d 397, 398-99 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  This broad scope of\r\n  review does not, however, require the reviewing court to disregard the findings\r\n  of the family court, which, having seen and heard the witnesses, is in a better\r\n  position to examine their credibility.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520,\r\n  522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979). Â Nor does this broad review relieve an\r\n  appellant of his or her burden of convincing the appellate court that the\r\n  family court committed error.Â  Id. at 523, 252 S.E.2d at 892. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Whether the family court\r\n  erred in reducing Husband's alimony obligations?\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court abused its discretion in reducing Husband's alimony\r\n  obligation.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  purpose of alimony is to provide the ex-spouse a substitute for the support that\r\n  was incident to the former marital relationship.Â  Croom v. Croom, 305\r\n  S.C. 158, 160, 406 S.E.2d 381, 382 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The question of whether to\r\n  increase or decrease alimony based on a finding of changed circumstances is a\r\n  matter committed to the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Brunner v.\r\n    Brunner, 296 S.C. 60, 64, 370 S.E.2d 614, 617 (Ct. App. 1988). Â The family\r\n  court's determination of whether to modify support will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal unless the family court abused its discretion. Â Id.Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the family court's decision is controlled by some error\r\n  of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary\r\n  support. McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1984).\r\nIn\r\n  order to justify a modification of an alimony award, the changes in\r\n  circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  Thornton v. Thornton,\r\n  328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997) (citing Calvert v. Calvert,\r\n  287 S.C. 130, 138, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1985)).Â  In determining\r\n  whether the change in circumstances warrants a modification, several\r\n  considerations relevant to the initial determination of an alimony award may be\r\n  applied in the modification context as well, including the parties' standard of\r\n  living during the marriage, each party's earning capacity, and the supporting\r\n  spouse's ability to continue to support the payee spouse.Â  Penny v. Green,\r\n  357 S.C. 583, 589, 594 S.E.2d 171, 174 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nWe agree\r\n  with the family court that Husband's change of circumstances constitutes a substantial\r\n  and material change.Â  Moreover, because we find evidentiary support for its\r\n  decision, we see no abuse of discretion in the family court's lowering Husband's\r\n  alimony obligations from $1,775 per month to $800 per month.Â  First, Husband's\r\n  annual income has been reduced from $108,948 at the time of the divorce to\r\n  $60,000.Â  See Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 519, 586 S.E.2d 136,\r\n  140 (Ct. App. 2003) (affirming family court's reduction in ex-husband's monthly\r\n  alimony from $4,583 to $2,500 in light of the fact ex-husband's monthly income\r\n  had been reduced from $18,100 to less than $14,000).Â  Second, because Husband's\r\n  income was reduced to $60,000 per year, his monthly expenses now exceed his\r\n  monthly income by almost $4,000.Â  Therefore, even if Husband were to cut out some\r\n  of what Wife describes as his &quot;discretionary&quot; expenses, he would\r\n  still remain in debt at the end of each month.Â  Third, Wife's overall financial\r\n  situation has arguably improved since the divorce.Â  Not only have her monthly\r\n  wages increased slightly since the divorce from $3,263 to $3,474, but she\r\n  testified she is no longer receiving medical treatment for her emotional\r\n  condition, which she was at the time of the divorce.Â  Taken together, we find\r\n  these facts support the family court's decision to lower Husband's alimony\r\n  obligation.\r\n2. Whether Husband's former\r\n  income should have been imputed?\r\n\r\n  a. Preservation\r\n\r\nHusband\r\n  argues this issue is not preserved for appeal because it was not raised to the\r\n  family court prior to Wife's Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter judgment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBut\r\n  for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an\r\n  issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the family court.Â  Lucas v.\r\n    Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â \r\n  &quot;Imposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to\r\n  enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant\r\n  facts, law, and arguments.&quot;Â  I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant,\r\n  338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000). Â As such, a party cannot use a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion to present to the family court an issue the party could have\r\n  raised prior to judgment but did not. Â Crary v. Djebelli, 321 S.C. 38,\r\n  43, 467 S.E.2d 128, 131-32 (Ct. App. 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 329\r\n  S.C. 385, 496 S.E.2d 21 (1998).\r\nAlthough\r\n  the first time the phrase &quot;whether income should be imputed&quot; appeared\r\n  in the pleadings was in Wife's Rule 59(e) motion, we feel this issue is\r\n  nevertheless preserved because the issue of imputed income was both raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the family court.Â  First, counsel for Wife asserted at trial\r\n  that &quot;the number one consideration [in this case] is that [Husband] is\r\n  underemployed&quot; because &quot;[Husband] chooses to stay with his fiancÃ©e in\r\n  Charleston and not . . . look anywhere else.&quot;Â  Underemployment and\r\n  imputation of income go hand in hand.Â  See Patel v. Patel, 359\r\n  S.C. 515, 532, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (&quot;It is proper to impute income\r\n  to a party who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.&quot;); Penny,\r\n  357 S.C. at 592, 594 S.E.2d at 175 (&quot;The family court's imputation of\r\n  income to Husband was tantamount to finding Husband underemployed.&quot;).Â  Thus,\r\n  by raising the issue of underemployment, we believe Wife sufficiently raised\r\n  the issue of income imputation.Â  Second, the issue of income imputation was\r\n  ruled upon by the family court when it justified its alimony reduction, at\r\n  least in part, by the fact that there &quot;were no comparable jobs available\r\n  in the Charleston area&quot; and there was &quot;no compelling reason that\r\n  [Husband] should be forced to leave the environment he has known for 25 years\r\n  to seek employment which might pay the same as he was receiving in\r\n  Charleston.&quot;Â  This was an implicit rejection of the argument that Husband\r\n  was underemployed.Â  See Pryor v. Nw. Apartments, Ltd., 321 S.C.\r\n  524, 528 n.2, 469 S.E.2d 630, 633 n.2 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding an issue\r\n  preserved when the circuit court implicitly ruled on and rejected the\r\n  respondent's argument).Â  Â Accordingly, we find the issue is preserved.\r\n\r\n  b. Merits\r\n\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to impute to Husband an income\r\n  comparable to that of his former position at the Club when modifying his\r\n  alimony obligations.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhether\r\n  termed voluntary underemployment, imputation of income, or the failure to reach\r\n  earning potential, the case law is clear that when a payor spouse seeks to\r\n  reduce support obligations based on his diminished income, a court should\r\n  consider the payor spouse's earning capacity. Â Kelley v. Kelley, 324\r\n  S.C. 481, 488, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The failure to reach\r\n  earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically equate to voluntary\r\n  underemployment such that income must be imputed.Â  Id. at 488-89, 477\r\n  S.E.2d at 731.Â  Although some of the precedents appear inconsistent, the common\r\n  thread in cases when actual income versus earning capacity is at issue is that\r\n  courts must closely examine the payor spouse's good faith and reasonable\r\n  explanation for the decreased income.Â  Id. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at 731; see Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 209, 532 S.E.2d 890, 893 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (declining to impute more than minimum wage to husband when there was no\r\n  evidence that the loss of his job was due to any wrongdoing, or that his\r\n  decision to start his own business was motivated by a desire to avoid his child\r\n  support obligations).Â  However, a payor spouse can be found to be voluntarily\r\n  underemployed even in the absence of a bad faith motivation.Â  Arnal v. Arnal,\r\n  371 S.C. 10, 13, 636 S.E.2d 864, 866 (2006).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Wife does not dispute Husband lost his job at the Club through no fault of his\r\n  own.Â  Husband networked for other club positions in the Charleston area but\r\n  found no other positions available.Â  At one point, Husband submitted his resume\r\n  to the Country Club of Charleston, but to no avail.Â  Other than this, Husband\r\n  has not pursued positions at any other clubs outside of Charleston.Â  Instead,\r\n  he accepted employment outside of his profession at Muhler at a much lower\r\n  salary than he received at the Club.Â  Husband's explanation for not pursuing\r\n  employment at his former salary is that he does not wish to relocate from\r\n  Charleston, where he has lived since 1982.Â  As the family court pointed out,\r\n  Husband &quot;ha[s] put down roots, ha[s] made friends and ha[s] established\r\n  [himself] as [a] citizen[] of Charleston County.&quot;Â  We find this to be a\r\n  good faith, reasonable explanation for his reduced income.\r\nTo\r\n  impute to Husband his former income in this case would essentially force him to\r\n  move outside of Charleston.Â  Courts are reluctant to invade a party's freedom\r\n  to pursue the employment path of their own choice or impose unreasonable\r\n  demands upon parties.Â  Kelley, 324 S.C. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at 731; see\r\n    also LaFrance v. LaFrance, 370 S.C. 622, 647, 636 S.E.2d 3, 16 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (holding the family court erred by imputing $100,000 income to\r\n  husband when the available positions identified by wife's expert witness as\r\n  paying that salary would all require husband to move away from his current\r\n  residence and his three minor children).Â  Other jurisdictions are similarly\r\n  reluctant to impute income based on the availability of jobs that require\r\n  relocation.Â  See Budnick v. Budnick, 595 S.E.2d 50, 59 (Va. Ct.\r\n  App. 2004) (finding no error in trial court's refusal to impute lost income to\r\n  wife who refused to accept a job transfer to a different city within the\r\n  state).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines) address the issue\r\n  of determining earning capacity.Â  The Guidelines define &quot;income&quot; as &quot;the\r\n  actual gross income of the parent if employed to full capacity, or potential\r\n  income if unemployed or underemployed.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2008). The Guidelines further provide:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    order to impute income to a parent who is unemployed or underemployed, the\r\n    court should determine the employment potential and probable earning level of\r\n    the parent based on that parent's recent work history, occupational\r\n    qualifications and prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the\r\n      community.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).Â  This suggests that, in determining\r\n  earning capacity for purposes of imputing income, a community standard should\r\n  be applied when determining the availability of employment.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  sum, we find no error in the family court's decision not to impute to Husband\r\n  his former income.\r\n3. Whether the trial court\r\n  erred in reducing Husband's alimony obligations by 55% when Husband's loss of\r\n  income was approximately 40%?\r\nWife\r\n  argues even if the reduction in alimony, in and of itself, was not an abuse of\r\n  discretion, the family court nevertheless abused its discretion in reducing\r\n  Husband's alimony obligations by fifty-five percent when Husband's loss of\r\n  income was only forty percent.Â  However, Wife has cited no legal authority to\r\n  support the argument that this was an error of law.Â  As such, this argument is\r\n  conclusory, and such arguments are deemed abandoned on appeal.Â  See Mulherin-Howell\r\n    v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding\r\n  party abandoned an issue on appeal due to failure to cite any supporting\r\n  authority and making only conclusory arguments).\r\n4. Whether the family court\r\n  erred in failing to award Husband attorneys' fees and costs?\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court abused its discretion in refusing to award him attorneys'\r\n  fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  award of attorneys' fees rests within the sound discretion of the family court\r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Upchurch\r\n    v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006).Â  In determining\r\n  whether attorneys' fees should be awarded, the following factors should be\r\n  considered: (1) the party's ability to pay his or her own attorneys' fee; (2) the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective\r\n  financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneys' fees on each party's\r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n  812, 816 (1992) (citing Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991)).Â  A beneficial result will not secure an award of attorneys'\r\n  fees where the other factors do not support such an award.Â  Mazzone, 341\r\n  S.C. at 214, 532 S.E.2d at 895.\r\nThe\r\n  family court considered the appropriate factors in its final order and held\r\n  that &quot;each party should be responsible for paying his and her own respective\r\n  attorneys' fees.&quot;Â  Although Husband's attorney obtained a beneficial\r\n  result, we believe in light of the other factors, the family court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying Husband's request for attorneys' fees.Â \r\n  According to Husband's affidavit in support of attorneys' fees and costs, his\r\n  attorneys' fees totaled $12,064.92.Â  According to Wife's financial declaration\r\n  dated February 18, 2007, she earns a gross income of only $3,474 per month as a\r\n  school teacher.Â  Thus, Husband's attorneys' fees represent over three months\r\n  worth of pay for Wife.Â  Moreover, Wife is in no better position to pay\r\n  Husband's fees than Husband is to pay his own, as Husband earns $60,000 per\r\n  year at Muhler.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in refusing to award Husband attorneys' fees and costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties do\r\n  not dispute Husband lost his job at the Club through no fault of his own.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4538","title":"SCDSS v.

(Mother) appeals\r\n  the family courtâ€™s order terminating her parental rights as to her five\r\n  children (Children).Â  Stanley E. (Father) appeals the family courtâ€™s\r\n  termination of his parental rights as to his child, N.C.Â  We reverse the family\r\n  court's TPR of Mother and affirm the family court's TPR of Father.Â  \r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nMother is a\r\n  mentally disabled single mother of five special needs children, ages eleven,\r\n  nine, eight, seven, and four. Â Each child has a different father.Â  Father is\r\n  the father of Motherâ€™s youngest child, N.C. \r\nIn\r\n  2004, the Williamsburg County Department of Social Services (DSS) took Children\r\n  into emergency protective custody. At the time of removal, two of the children\r\n  lived with Mother and three of the children lived with their maternal\r\n  grandmother (Grandmother).[2]Â  The family court found Motherâ€™s home had no water and no electricity, and\r\n  Mother was behind in her rent.Â  Grandmotherâ€™s home had no water, no stove, and\r\n  weak and sagging floors. Â Â In addition, Grandmother was diabetic and had badly\r\n  swollen knees.Â  Ultimately, the family court held there was probable cause for\r\n  law enforcement to take emergency protective custody of Children. \r\nDSS developed a\r\n  treatment plan for Mother and Grandmother.Â  Motherâ€™s treatment plan required\r\n  Mother to secure and maintain appropriate housing, enroll at the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, and complete parenting\r\n  effectiveness training classes. The family court approved the treatment plan,\r\n  finding Mother &quot;made some progress toward removing the risk of harm to the\r\n  minor children.&quot; Grandmother passed away during the course of this\r\n  action.\r\nFather\r\n  began visiting and supporting his daughter, N.C., in 2006.Â  He had little\r\n  contact with N.C. prior to that time.Â  Father informed DSS that he was unable\r\n  to take N.C. because he did not have his own home.Â  Instead, Father suggested\r\n  DSS place N.C. with Fatherâ€™s adult daughter, Brandy. Â Â Although Brandy\r\n  initially expressed an interest in N.C., Brandy later told DSS she wanted\r\n  Father to take a paternity test to prove N.C. was her sister. Â Â Father refused\r\n  to take a paternity test.Â  Ultimately, DSS did not offer Father a treatment\r\n  plan because his parental rights had been terminated as to other children in\r\n  the past. \r\nDSS initiated a\r\n  termination of parental rights (TPR) action against Mother, Father, and several\r\n  other biological fathers in January 2007. Â In May 2007, the family court\r\n  terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights to Children after finding termination was\r\n  in the best interest of Children and the following statutory grounds: (1)\r\n  Children lived outside of Motherâ€™s home for six months and Mother failed to\r\n  remedy the conditions that caused the removal; (2) Mother had a diagnosable\r\n  condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time and the condition made\r\n  Mother unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of Children; (3) Mother\r\n  neglected Children, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or\r\n  neglect, it was not likely the home could be made safe within twelve months;\r\n  and (4) Children had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent\r\n  twenty-two months. Â \r\nThe\r\n  family court relied on the testimony of the guardian ad litem (GAL), foster\r\n  care caseworker, and Mother and Father in determining that TPR was in the best\r\n  interest of the Children.Â  However, the family court noted:Â  &quot;There\r\n  is no doubt that Janice C[.] expresses her love and concern for her children.Â \r\n  However, she is unable to care for them.Â  Stanley E[.] professes love and\r\n  concern for his child, but will not change his living situation in order to\r\n  care for the child.&quot; Â During the termination hearing, the GAL\r\n  testified TPR was in the Childrenâ€™s best interest because they &quot;need[ed]\r\n  some permanency.&quot; Â However, GAL admitted he never visited or interviewed\r\n  Mother or Children.Â  The family court noted: &quot;[GAL's] opinion is\r\n  that the children are best served by being freed for adoption in order to be\r\n  placed in a stable home with the opportunity to meet the special needs of each\r\n  child.&quot;Â  In addition, Gloria Davis, the foster care caseworker, testified\r\n  Mother failed to complete her treatment plan. Â Other evidence presented,\r\n  however, demonstrates Mother was making progress toward completing her\r\n  treatment plan and had completed all of the parenting classes. Â Â The family\r\n  courtâ€™s order also terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights as to N.C.Â  after\r\n  finding termination was in the best interest of N.C. and the following\r\n  statutory grounds: (1) Father severely neglected N.C. and it is unreasonable\r\n  that the home can be made safe within twelve months; (2) Father abandoned N.C.;\r\n  and (3) N.C. has been in foster care for fifteen out of the most recent twenty-two\r\n  months.Â  Mother and Father appeal.\r\nII.&nbsp; MOTHERâ€™S APPEAL\r\nA.&nbsp; Standard of Review\r\nMother\r\n  first argues the family court applied the incorrect standard of review.Â  Specifically, Mother contends the family court\r\n  applied the preponderance of the evidence standard in terminating her parental\r\n  rights instead of the proper clear and convincing standard.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note the family courtâ€™s order provides: &quot;Based upon an examination of\r\n  the pleadings, consideration of all of the testimony and evidence presented,\r\n  and the recommendations of the guardian ad litem for the minor child, I find\r\n  that the evidence presented is clear and convincing, and from such\r\n  evidence and testimony, I make the following findings . . . .&quot; Â (emphasis added).Â  Based on this language, we find the family court applied the\r\n  correct standard of review.Â  Furthermore, any error was harmless because we are\r\n  determining our own findings from the record as to whether clear and convincing\r\n  evidence supports the termination of parental rights.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Proofs of Service\r\nMother\r\n  also argues the family court erred by referencing properly filed acceptances\r\n  and affidavits of services in its TPR order where the proofs of service were\r\n  not entered into evidence at the hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule\r\n  201, SCRE, governing the taking of judicial notice, provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(a) Scope of Rule. This rule governs only judicial notice of\r\n  adjudicative facts.\r\n\t(b)\r\n  Kinds of Facts. A judicially\r\n  noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either\r\n  (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or\r\n  (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose\r\n  accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\t(f)\r\n  Time of Taking Notice. Judicial\r\n  notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n    When a court takes judicial notice of a fact it &quot;admit[s] into\r\n  evidence and consider[s], without proof of the facts, matters of common and\r\n  general knowledge.&quot; Â Moss v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 370,\r\n  377, 228 S.E.2d 108, 112 (1976) (citation omitted).Â  To be subjected to judicial\r\n  notice, a fact must be of &quot;such common knowledge that it is accepted by\r\n  the general public without qualification or contention, or its accuracy may be\r\n  ascertained by reference to readily available sources of indisputable\r\n  reliability.&quot; Â Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 94, 561 S.E.2d 610,\r\n  615 (Ct. App. 2002) (citation omitted).Â  Further, &quot;a court can take judicial notice of its own records, files and proceedings for all\r\n  proper purposes including facts established in its records.&quot;Â  Freeman\r\n    v. McBee, 280 S.C. 490, 494, 313 S.E.2d 325, 327&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984).\r\nHere, the family\r\n  court took judicial notice of acceptances and affidavits of services.Â  These\r\n  documents were filed with the family court; therefore, they were part of the\r\n  record.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err by referencing the documents\r\n  in its order.Â  Furthermore, even if this court determines the family court\r\n  erred by referencing the documents, any error was harmless because Mother does\r\n  not argue any party was improperly served.\r\nC.&nbsp; TPR\r\nFinally,\r\n  Mother contends the family court erred by terminating her parental rights.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe termination of the legal relationship between natural parents\r\n  and a child presents one [of] the most difficult issues this Court is called\r\n  upon to decide.Â  We exercise great caution in reviewing termination proceedings\r\n  and will conclude termination is proper only when the evidence clearly and\r\n  convincingly mandates such a result.\r\n\r\nDepâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n  Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).Â  \r\nProcedures\r\n  for TPR are governed by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 63-7-2510 to\r\n  2610 (Supp. 2008).Â  The purpose of the TPR statute is:\r\n\r\n\tto\r\n  establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of\r\n  parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to\r\n  protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for\r\n  adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love\r\n  and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2510\r\n  (Supp. 2008). \r\nThe\r\n  family court may order TPR upon a finding of one or more of the eleven\r\n  statutory grounds and a finding that TPR is in the best interest of the child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2008).Â  The TPR statute &quot;must\r\n  be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for\r\n  freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by\r\n  terminating the parent-child relationship.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620\r\n  (Supp. 2008).\r\n&quot;If\r\n  the family court finds that a statutory ground for [TPR] has been proven, it\r\n  must then find that the best interests of the child would be served by\r\n  [TPR].&quot;Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 580, 578 S.E.2d 733,\r\n  735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;In a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, the\r\n  best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.&quot;Â  Id. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  &quot;The\r\n  interests of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental\r\n  rights conflict.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (Supp. 2008).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, there is no question that at least one of the eleven statutory\r\n  grounds for TPR has been met.Â  It is undisputed Children have been in foster\r\n  care since July 27, 2004 and have not lived with Mother since that date.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(8) (Supp. 2008).Â  The question of whether TPR is in\r\n  Childrenâ€™s best interest, however, is a more difficult issue.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the TPR hearing, Gloria Davis, a foster care caseworker, testified for DSS.Â  She\r\n  testified Mother &quot;cares for her Children, but does not know how to parent\r\n  the children.&quot;Â  She stated Mother visited Children in foster care on a\r\n  regular basis and rarely missed a visit.Â  She also provided nonmonetary support\r\n  to Children, including food items and clothing.Â  Davis testified\r\n  Children enjoyed interacting with Mother and recognized Mother as their mother.\r\n  Although Davis maintained Mother failed to maintain adequate housing, Davis\r\n  conceded she last visited Motherâ€™s home five months prior to the hearing and\r\n  only observed the living room during that visit.Â  Davis added Mother failed to\r\n  complete her treatment plan, explaining Mother refused services from the\r\n  Department of Special Needs and failed to complete parenting classes. \r\nOther\r\n  evidence presented at the hearing, however, demonstrates Mother was making\r\n  progress toward completing her treatment plan.Â  Leteesa George, of the\r\n  Department of Special Needs, testified Mother recently accepted services with\r\n  the Department of Special Needs.Â  George added she was in the process of\r\n  preparing Motherâ€™s intake packet to determine whether Mother was eligible for\r\n  services.Â  In addition, Vanessa Boatwright, of Consulting Concepts,\r\n  testified DSS referred Mother to Consulting Concepts for parenting classes.Â \r\n  Boatwright stated Mother completed all of the parenting classes and contributed\r\n  to the classes.\r\nDr.\r\n  Douglas Ritz, a clinical psychologist who evaluated Mother on February 9, 2007,\r\n  also testified at the hearing.Â  He testified the evaluation lasted\r\n  approximately two to three hours, and Ritz did not observe Mother taking care\r\n  of Children.Â  Ritz opined Motherâ€™s &quot;cognitive abilities came in the\r\n  diagnostic category of mild mental retardation&quot; and she functions at a\r\n  second-grade level. Ultimately, he determined a person with Motherâ€™s\r\n  characteristics could not adequately parent five children without some type of\r\n  live-in help.Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  GAL appointed to the case in 2006 testified although Mother loves Children,\r\n  visited them, and provided in-kind support, he did not feel she was capable of\r\n  caring for Children and meeting their needs.Â  He noted Motherâ€™s and Childrenâ€™s\r\n  special needs.Â  GAL further testified Children had been in foster care for\r\n  three years and were doing well.Â  He admitted he never visited or\r\n  interviewed Mother or Children but recommended TPR because Children &quot;need[ed]\r\n  some permanency.&quot; Â However, he further testified that he had no\r\n  objection to permanent foster care, which would allow the children to have a\r\n  continuing relationship with their Mother, if no adoptive resource was\r\n  available. \r\nA\r\n  primary objective of the TPR statutes is to free children for the stability\r\n  adoption can provide.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2510 (Supp. 2008).Â  TPR would leave Children without a legal mother.Â  Reunification\r\n  may never be a possibility given Motherâ€™s limitations.Â  However, reversing TPR\r\n  will maintain Motherâ€™s parental rights and will allow Mother to continue\r\n  visiting Children, while they remain in their current foster care home where\r\n  they are receiving the services they need.Â  We hesitate to grant TPR when the\r\n  GAL and Dr. Ritz never observed Mother interacting with her Children.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the record does not reflect and the GAL admitted he never visited\r\n  or interviewed Mother or Children.Â  Therefore, we do not believe the GAL\r\n  &quot;conduct[ed] an independent assessment of the facts . . . .&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Â§ 63-11-510 (Supp. 2008).Â  We also note a discrepancy in the GAL's\r\n  testimony.Â  Though he recommended TPR because Children need some permanency, he\r\n  also recognized Mother loves her Children and has provided in-kind support.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Childrenâ€™s best interests are the paramount consideration in a TPR action,\r\n  under these facts, it appears the family court erred in finding termination of\r\n  Motherâ€™s parental rights was in Childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  We see no harm in allowing\r\n  Children to remain in their current placement, which would enable visitation\r\n  between Mother and Children to continue.Â  Moreover, the record is devoid of any\r\n  evidence that suitable adoptive parents have been identified.Â  Consequently, TPR\r\n  will not provide future stability for Children.Â  Accordingly, we believe TPR is\r\n  premature at this time based on the record before the court and reverse the\r\n  family court's TPR of Mother.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; FATHERâ€™S APPEAL \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard of ReviewÂ  \r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court applied the incorrect standard of review.Â  Mother\r\n  raised this very same issue in her brief, and it is addressed above.Â  As stated\r\n  above, we affirm the family court as to this issue and find the family court applied the correct standard of\r\n  review. Furthermore, any error was harmless because we are determining our own\r\n  findings from the record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports\r\n  the termination of parental rights.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Headden, 354 S.C. at 609, 582 S.E.2d at 423.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Proofs of Service \r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred by referencing properly filed acceptances and\r\n  affidavits of services in its TPR order where the proofs of service were not\r\n  entered into evidence at the hearing.Â  Father, however, does not argue any\r\n  party was improperly served.Â  This issue was raised by Mother and is addressed\r\n  above.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Treatment Plan\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred by ruling DSS was not required to offer him a\r\n  treatment plan.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;If\r\n  the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of the parent or\r\n  guardian, the court must approve a placement plan.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-7-1680 (Supp. 2008).Â  &quot;[T]he nature of the changes in the home and\r\n  family situation that must be made to correct the problems that necessitated\r\n  removal&quot; must be included in the plan.Â  Id.\r\nFather\r\n  never had custody of N.C. and has always maintained that he could not provide a\r\n  home for N.C.Â  In fact, Father did not begin visiting and supporting N.C. until\r\n  she was in foster care.Â  Furthermore, offering Father a treatment plan to\r\n  reunite Father with N.C. would have been futile because Father told DSS he was\r\n  unable to accept custody of N.C. because he did not have his own home.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp; TPR\r\nFinally,\r\n  Father contends the family court erred by terminating his parental rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere\r\n  is no question that at least one of the eleven statutory grounds for TPR has\r\n  been met.Â  N.C. has been in foster care since July 27, 2004 and she has never\r\n  lived with Father.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(8).Â  Additionally, because the evidence clearly and convincingly indicates\r\n  TPR is in N.C.â€™s best interest we affirm the family court's TPR of Father.Â  \r\nFather\r\n  lives with his girlfriend and has admitted he cannot bring N.C. into that\r\n  home.Â  Father's situation can also be distinguished from that of Mother.Â  Evidence\r\n  demonstrates Mother completed her parenting classes and rarely missed visits\r\n  with her children.Â  We find Mother's efforts to comply with her treatment plan,\r\n  together with her mental handicaps distinguish her situation from Father's situation.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Mother has maintained a relationship with her Children since their\r\n  birth, whereas Father's relationship with N.C. only began in 2006.Â \r\n  Additionally, though not outcome determinative, we find problems with Father's\r\n  failure to submit to a paternity test.Â  Accordingly, we believe terminating\r\n  Father's parental rights is in N.C.â€™s best interest and the family court's\r\n  order is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART. \r\nHUFF\r\n  and THOMAS, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Effective June 16, 2008, the General Assembly amended\r\n  the Code of Laws of South Carolina by adding Title 63, the South Carolina\r\n  Childrenâ€™s Code, and transferring all provisions of Title 20, Chapter 7 to\r\n  Title 63.Â  See Act No. 361, 2008 S.C.
