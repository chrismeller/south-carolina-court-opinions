The basis for the denial of compensation was the failure of the claimant to report an alleged injury in January 2001 until December 2001.  The Workersâ€™ Compensation Appellate Panel ruled that the claimant did not provide a reasonable excuse for her failure to give notice and the employer was prejudiced thereby.

Lacy, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nDavid V. Benson, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â In this Workersâ€™ Compensation case, the employer, Isochem Colors, Inc., appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the denial of benefits to Teresa A. Bass by the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  The circuit court reversed on the ground that substantial evidence did not support the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision to deny benefits because Bass failed to give timely notice of her accident to Isochem.Â  We affirm in result and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn August of 1999, Bass was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  After her doctor prescribed Motrin, Bass â€œdidnâ€™t have the problem anymore.â€Â  On November 16, 2000, Bass began working at Isochem as a truck driver.Â  Prior to starting work at Isochem, Bass had a pre-employment physical and was â€œpronounced fit and able to work.â€Â  At Isochem, Bass was responsible for delivering large drums of powdered dye weighing between 100 to 500 pounds.Â  This required Bass to load and unload the drums by tilting them on their edge and rolling the drums off of the truck, arm over arm, as she made deliveries.Â  Depending on the number of delivery orders Isochem received, Bass delivered between one and fifty drums per day.\r\nAccording to Bass, in January of 2001, she was delivering drums of dye to Amble Knitwear in Kings Mountain when she tipped a drum and â€œhad some pain in [her] hand.â€Â  Bass declared she â€œfirst notice[ed] problems with [her] arms when [she was] working for Isochem . . . [a]bout January of 2001.â€Â Â  Bass did not immediately inform anyone at work of her â€œproblemsâ€ because she â€œthought it would go away.â€Â  Bass stated she informed her supervisor, Angela Radcliff, of the â€œproblemsâ€ â€œa few months later.â€Â  Bass admitted she did not remember exactly when she told Radcliff but asserted that she advised Radcliff of her â€œproblemsâ€ â€œon a few occasions.â€Â  Bass testified:\r\n\r\nI told [Radcliff] that moving the drums and all is bothering me.Â  The pain is bothering me.Â  I even told her that my hands were going numb at night.Â  I told her that my hands, as a matter of fact I was driving and my hands were going numb while I was driving.Â  And I was talking to her on the telephone at that time.Â  And I told her that my hands were going numb then.\r\n\r\nRadcliff did not recall Bass mentioning any â€œproblems with her hands or wristsâ€ until November of 2001.Â  Radcliff professed: â€œ[Bass] had come to me and she had said that that night during when she was sleeping that they were going numb and they were, you know, felt like they were asleep.Â  And they were bothering her and hurting her.â€Â  In the Supervisorâ€™s Accident Investigation Report, Radcliff indicated Bassâ€™ â€œHand/Wristâ€ injury was reported on December 6, 2001.Â  Bridget Roberge filled out a â€œWorkersâ€™ Compensationâ€”First Report of Injury or Illnessâ€ form on December 6, 2001.Â  On the form, Roberge noted the â€œdate of injury/illnessâ€ and the â€œdate employer notifiedâ€ was â€œ12/06/01.â€Â  Roberge further noted the â€œtype of injury/illnessâ€ was â€œcarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)â€ and the â€œpart of body affectedâ€ was the â€œwrist.â€\r\nAfter several months of progressive pain, Bass sought medical treatment from Dr. Donald H. McQueen, III on November 28, 2001.Â  At Dr. McQueenâ€™s office, Bass answered questions on the â€œPatient Medical History Formâ€ in the following manner:\r\n\r\nWhat will we be seeing you for today?Â  wristÂ Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nIf this was not the result of an accident, please tell us when your pain started.Â  If you are unsure, please give an approximate date:Â  approx. 10 mons. ago\r\n\r\nIn his medical note from Bassâ€™ November visit, Dr. McQueen wrote: â€œProblem: Pain in both hands with numbness. . . . Has developed pain in both hands.â€Â  Dr. McQueen diagnosed Bass with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and suggested surgery to alleviate her symptoms.Â  Bass underwent a right carpal tunnel release on December 28, 2001 and a left carpal tunnel release on January 28, 2002.Â  In a letter to Bassâ€™ attorney dated January 15, 2002, Dr. McQueen opined:\r\n\r\n[I] am unable to state that most probably and to a reasonable . . . degree of medical certainty that [Bassâ€™ work] activities have caused injury to her wrists.\r\n. . . [A] person with carpal tunnel syndrome would most likely aggravate a pre-existing condition if they performed a strenuous job in a repetitious manner.\r\nIt is reasonable to say that Ms. Bass may have aggravated a pre-existing condition.\r\n\r\nOn January 9, 2002, Bass filed a Form 50 seeking Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  On the Form 50, Bass alleged:\r\n\r\n1.a.Â  The claimant sustained an accidental injury to Both arms on 11-28-01 (12a says 12-6-01) in York County, State of South Carolina.\r\n1.b.Â  Describe briefly how the accident occurredÂ  Repetitive loading and unloading of drums of powdered dye weighing From 110 through 400 lbs. caused injury to both wrists and arm manifesting itself in the need (See Attachment)\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\n4.Â  At the time of the injury the claimant was performing services arising out of and in the course of employment.\r\n5.Â  Notice of the accidental injury was given to the employer on 11-28-01 in the following manner:Â  Angela, her supervisorâ€”on various occasions and on 11-28-01.\r\n\r\nIsochem denied the claim on the ground that Bass failed to give timely notice.\r\nIn spite of the surgery, Bass continued to have problems.Â  Because of these â€œcomplications,â€ Bass was evaluated by Dr. J. Samuel Seastrunk, an orthopedic surgeon, on April 1, 2002.Â  When asked if she told Dr. Seastrunk â€œabout this event in January of 2001,â€ Bass replied: â€œYes, sir, I did.â€Â  Bass testified:\r\n\r\nI told [Dr. Seastrunk] that I was at Amble Knitwear in Kings Mountain [in January of 2001] and I tipped a drum and I realized that I had some pain in my hand.Â  Then I told him that the pain got worser [sic] and worser [sic].Â  And I got to where I just couldnâ€™t stand it no more.Â  And I ended up going to Dr. McQueen and he done surgery.\r\n\r\nCounsel for Isochem asked Bass: â€œIs it fair to say then that the pain you were having in your hands, was the first time that you related it to rolling the drums was in January of 2001?â€Â  Bass answered: â€œApproximately that time.â€\r\nIn his medical notes, Dr. Seastrunk stated: â€œ[Bass] relates that sometime in January of 2001 that she injured both wrists when she pulled on a drum and her wrists began hurting her.â€Â  Dr. Seastrunk opined:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        IMPRESSION:&nbsp;\r\n         1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome with bilateral carpal tunnel release as a result of Workers Comp injury from repetitive loading and unloading heavy weights.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND DISCUSSION:\r\nFrom the information that I have and in accordance with my evaluation of Ms. Bass today, it is my feeling that the problems she is having with both wrists, that is carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally, is directly related to the repetitive loading and unloading of drums which seem to be an ongoing process, necessitating her to refer herself to Dr. McQueen on 11-28-01 in which he made the diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. . . . [I]t is my feeling that [Bass] is impaired to her right upper extremity by at least ten percent 10% as a result of the carpal tunnel syndrome and also to her left upper extremity by at least thirteen percent (13%) relative to the carpal tunnel syndrome and also the area of hard spot in her left palm.\r\n\r\nIn his deposition, Dr. Seastrunk said Bass described an injury to him that occurred in January of 2001:\r\n\r\nShe was describing these drums and she apparently was pulling on the drum.Â  I donâ€™t know exactly what these drums look like.Â  She probably used a hand dolly or something to maneuver these things and was pulling on a drum, probably trying to get it in better position and she had a feeling of pain, if I recall, in her wrist area. . . . The date of the injury she gives is January 2001.\r\n\r\nDr. Seastrunk reiterated: â€œMy opinion is that [Bass] developed carpal tunnel as a result of the type of activity she was doing.â€\r\nThe Single Commissioner denied Bassâ€™ claim for benefits.Â  In the Commissionerâ€™s order under â€œStatement of the Case,â€ the Commissioner declared: â€œThis is a denied carpal tunnel syndrome case.â€Â  Under â€œSummary of Evidence,â€ the Commissioner stated:\r\n\r\nBass has a history of carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  On August 31, 1999, she was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome by her family physician, Dr. Steven Oehme.Â  Bass denied any long-term affects [sic] and did not return to Dr. Oehme for follow-up visits.Â  Dr. Oehmeâ€™s report . . . states claimant was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, mild, left greater than the right.Â  Dr. Oehmeâ€™s report indicates Bass should take anti-inflammatories and consider a brace.Â  The report states that, â€œShe agrees.â€\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nBass underwent right carpal tunnel release by Dr. McQueen on December 28, 2001.Â  She underwent left carpal tunnel release on January 28, 2002. . . .\r\n\r\nIn the section entitled â€œFindings of Fact,â€ the Commissioner found: â€œOn August 11, 1999, claimant was first diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome by Dr. Oehme and was given anti-inflammatories.â€Â  The Commissioner noted that Bass testified her initial injury occurred in January 2001.Â  Under â€œConclusions of Law,â€ the Commissioner explained: â€œCarpal tunnel syndrome, even if caused by repetitive motion, is compensable as an accident under the Act.â€Â  The Commissioner concluded:\r\n\r\nClaimant suffered an injury by accident in January 2001 but did not report it until December 6, 2001.Â  In the meantime, her condition became progressively worse such that ultimately it required a carpal tunnel release to both wrists.Â  Although claimant had frequent conversations with her supervisor, she did not report her injury until eleven months thereafter which is unreasonable.Â  The employer was prejudiced because it had no opportunity to provide medical treatment until claimantâ€™s condition had progressed to such an extent that surgery was required on both hands.Â  Claimant is in violation of Section 42-15-20.Â  Her claim is barred by her failure to give the requisite 90 days notice and her claim for benefits is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel unanimously affirmed the Single Commissioner and denied benefits to Bass.Â  The Panel expounded:\r\n\r\nThe Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law as established by the hearing commissioner are correct and . . . are adopted verbatim by the panel as though repeated herein.\r\nFurther, to support the hearing commissionerâ€™s decision, this panel notes:\r\nThe commissioner found in his order that the claimant did indeed suffer an injury by accident.Â  It was not compensable due to the claimantâ€™s failure to report and give notice as required by law.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe order of the single commissioner is hereby affirmed.Â  All Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are incorporated to become the final Decision and Order of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  In a footnote, the Panel stated that â€œ[a]ll unchanged Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law as contained in the single commissionerâ€™s order are specifically referenced and included in toto in the â€œorderâ€ portion of this decision.â€Â  (Emphasis in original).\r\nThe circuit court reversed the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision regarding compensability on the ground that substantial evidence did not support the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings.Â  The court ruled:\r\n\r\nIn her Form 50, Ms. Bass did place a single date of accident in January of 200[1].Â  She also, however, alleged that the repetitive loading and unloading of drums was the cause of her problems which resulted in the medical care and treatment of November 28, 2001.Â  The Full Commission and the hearing commissioner ignored that alternative pleading. . . .\r\n. . . To deny [Bass] benefits based on one position in her Form 50 denies the whole purpose of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act which is to protect injured workers.\r\nThe opinion of this Court, therefore, is that the Full Commission and the hearing commissionerâ€™s Order is not supported by substantial evidence of record and should be reversed.Â  The medical records, particularly the testimony of Dr. Seastrunk coupled with Ms. Bassâ€™ testimony, clearly indicates that this was a repetitive motion injury deemed by our Supreme Court to be compensable.Â  The purpose of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is for inclusion of injured workers not exclusion.Â  Ms. Bass was injured in the course and scope of her employment and is entitled to benefits.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision.Â  Frame, 357 S.C. at 527, 593 S.E.2d at 494; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Lockridge v. Santens of America, Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€).Â  Pursuant to the APA, this Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  See Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 610 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. # 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); see also Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.â€); Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting that in reviewing decision of Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, court of appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported by substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004); Jones v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 586 S.E.2d 111 (2003); Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729; Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495; Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); DuRant v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 604 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin, 351 S.C. at 618, 571 S.E.2d at 95; Muir, 336 S.C. at 282, 519 S.E.2d at 591.Â  Where there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive.Â  Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 290, 599 S.E.2d at 611; Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 455, 562 S.E.2d at 681.\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of the Appellate Panel which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Pratt, 357 S.C. at 622, 594 S.E.2d at 274-75; Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIsochem argues the circuit court erred in reversing the Appellate Panelâ€™s denial of Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits to Bass.Â  Isochem alleges Bass suffered a single, identifiable injury by accident in January of 2001 and failed to give notice of her injury within ninety days of its occurrence, as required by section 42-15-20 of the South Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\nA priori, we are confronted with the novel issue arising from the factual scenario of this case: Is a repetitive trauma injury, i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome, treated separately and differently from an identifiable injury by accident under the notice mandate of section 42-15-20?\r\nI.Â  Principles of Statutory Construction\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature.Â  Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 579 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Gordon v. Phillips Utils., Inc., 362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005) (â€œThe primary purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 567 S.E.2d 240 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Municipal Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. AT&amp;T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 606 S.E.2d 468 (2004); Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582.Â  The courtâ€™s primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.Â  Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 564 S.E.2d 358 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œOnce the legislature has made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment based upon their own notions of public policy.â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nWhen a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.Â  Miller v. Aiken, Op. No. 25976 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 2, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 19 at 16); Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 442 S.E.2d 177 (1994).Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is unambiguous and clear, there is no need to employ the rules of statutory construction and this Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 585 S.E.2d 292 (2003); Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); see also City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 561, 486 S.E.2d 492, 495 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œWhere the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it which are not in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€).Â  What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction.Â  Durham v. United Cos. Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d 465 (1998); Adkins v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 475 S.E.2d 762 (1996); Worsley Cos. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 351 S.C. 97, 567 S.E.2d 907 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970) (observing that where the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it that are not in the legislatureâ€™s language).Â  Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000); Bayle, 344 S.C. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739.\r\nIf the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself.Â  Morgan, 352 S.C. at 367, 574 S.E.2d at 207; see also Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (â€œ[W]here a statute is ambiguous, the Court must construe the terms of the statute.â€).Â  An ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial, and equitable operation of the law.Â  Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at 582; Brassell, 326 S.C. at 561, 486 S.E.2d at 495; City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In construing a statute, the court looks to the language as a whole in light of its manifest purpose.Â  State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162, 573 S.E.2d 783 (2002); Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320 S.C. 213, 464 S.E.2d 109 (1995); Brassell, 326 S.C. at 560, 486 S.E.2d at 494.\r\nA statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.Â  See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, 354 S.C. at 22, 579 S.E.2d at 336 (â€œA statute should be given a reasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the statute.â€).Â  The real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will prevail over the literal import of the words.Â  Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 414 S.E.2d 115 (1992).\r\nCourts will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.Â  Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529 S.E.2d 280 (2000); Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994).Â  A court should not consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  See Liberty\r\nMut. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. at ___, 611 S.E.2d at 302; see also Mid-State Auto Auction v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996) (stating that in ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as a whole).\r\nII.Â  Notice Requirement/Section 42-15-20\r\nThe notice requirement, section 42-15-20 of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, reads:\r\n\r\nEvery injured employee or his representative shall immediately on the occurrence of an accident, or as soon thereafter as practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer a notice of the accident and the employee shall not be entitled to physicianâ€™s fees nor to any compensation which may have accrued under the terms of this Title prior to the giving of such notice, unless it can be shown that the employer, his agent or representative, had knowledge of the accident or that the party required to give such notice had been prevented from doing so by reason of physical or mental incapacity or the fraud or deceit of some third person.Â  No compensation shall be payable unless such notice is given within ninety days after the occurrence of the accident or death, unless reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the Commission for not giving such notice and the Commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced thereby. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985) (emphasis added).\r\nSection 42-15-20 requires that every injured employee or his representative give the employer notice of a job-related accident within ninety days after its occurrence.Â  Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985); see also McCraw v. Mary Black Hosp., 350 S.C. 229, 237, 565 S.E.2d 286, 290 (2002) (â€œPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985), notice to the employer must be given within 90 days after the occurrence of the accident upon which the employee is basing her claim.â€).Â  Generally, the injury is not compensable unless notice is given within ninety days.Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The burden is upon the claimant to show compliance with the notice provisions of section 42-15-20.Â  See Lowe v. Am-Can Transport Servs., Inc., 283 S.C. 534, 324 S.E.2d 87 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nSection 42-15-20 provides no specific method of giving notice, the object being that the employer be actually put on notice of the injury so he can investigate it immediately after its occurrence and can furnish medical care for the employee in order to minimize the disability and his own liability.Â  See Teigue v. Appleton Co., 221 S.C. 52, 68 S.E.2d 878 (1952); Hanks, 286 S.C. at 381, 335 S.E.2d at 93.Â  While the notice requirement must be construed liberally in favor of claimants, it is â€œnot to be treated as a mere formality or technicality and dispensed with as a matter of course.â€Â  Mintz v. Fiske-Carter Constr. Co., 218 S.C. 409, 414, 63 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1951).Â  The purpose of section 42-15-20 is twofold: â€œfirst, it affords protection of the employer in order that he may investigate the facts and question witnesses while their memories are unfaded, and second, it affords the employer opportunity to furnish medical care of the employee in order to minimize the disability and consequent liability upon the employer.â€Â  Id.\r\nThis Court addressed the notice requirement in Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002):\r\n\r\nThe statutory efficacy of Â§ 42-15-20 is bifurcated: (1) affording protection for the employer to investigate the facts and circumstances of an accident or injury and to question witnesses while memories are fresh; and (2) permitting the employer the opportunity and privilege to provide medical treatment and care to minimize disability and concomitant liability of the employer.\r\nWe rule the language of Â§ 42-15-20 in regard to notice should be liberally construed in favor of claimants.Â  We conclude that notice is adequate, when there is some knowledge of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and signifying to a reasonably conscientious supervisor that the case might involve a potential compensation claim.\r\n\r\nId. at 459, 562 S.E.2d at 683.\r\nIn his treatise on Workersâ€™ Compensation law, Professor Larson discussed the notice requirement:\r\n\r\nUnder most acts, there are two distinct limitations periods that must be observed: The period for notice of injury, and the period for claiming compensation.\r\nNotice of injury, the first step in compensation procedure, is normally given to the employer. . . . The period is comparatively short; it may be â€œforthwith,â€ or â€œas soon as practicable,â€ or a specified period of a few weeks or months.Â  The purpose is dual: First, to enable the employer to provide immediate medical diagnosis and treatment with a view to minimizing the seriousness of the injury; and second, to facilitate the earliest possible investigation of the facts surrounding the injury.Â  If, upon receiving notice, the employer wishes to controvert the claim, it must itself file a notice to this effect.Â  Failure to do so, however, will not estop the employer from later asserting its defenses.\r\n\r\n7 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 126.01 (2004).\r\nSection 42-15-20 is a policy statement embedded in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act by the South Carolina General Assembly that consolidates and harmonizes the employer and employee under the statutory rubric of notification and accountability.\r\nIII.Â  Repetitive Trauma Injury\r\nGenerally, a repetitive trauma injury, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, is compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Pee v. AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167, 573 S.E.2d 785 (2002).Â  The Pee court found â€œa repetitive trauma injury meets the definition of injury by accident in that it is an unforeseen injury caused by trauma.â€Â  Id. at 174, 573 S.E.2d at 789.\r\nRepetitive trauma injuries have a gradual onset caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive traumatic events or â€œmini-accidents.â€Â  Schurlknight v. City of North Charleston, 352 S.C. 175, 574 S.E.2d 194 (2002).Â  It is difficult to determine the date an accident occurs in a repetitive trauma case because there is no definite time of injury.Â  Id.Â  â€œApplying the discovery rule to such an injury often works to the prejudice of an employee who discovers symptoms of a repetitive trauma injury but continues to work.â€Â  Id. at 178, 574 S.E.2d at 195.\r\nIn a repetitive trauma case, although the statute of limitations begins to run the last day of exposure, a Workersâ€™ Compensation claimant is still required to separately give the employer notice of an injury.Â  See Schurlknight, 352 S.C. at 178-79, 574 S.E.2d at 195-96 (citing Â§ 42-15-20) (â€œWe also note the separate requirement that a worker give the employer notice of an injury.â€).Â  This notice requirement ensures the employer will not be unfairly prejudiced by a two-year period for filing that begins from the last date of exposure.Â  Id.\r\nIV.Â  Applicability of Section 42-15-20 to\r\nRepetitive Trauma Injury/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\r\nA.Â  The Extant Evidentiary Record\r\nDeciding this case on the basis of a specific â€œaccidentâ€ in January of 2001 is a misreckoning or inadvertency of the factual and legal record.Â  Encapsulated in the Single Commissionerâ€™s order, as affirmed by the Appellate Panel, is specific and definitive discussion and evaluation of the carpal tunnel syndrome experienced by Bass with precedential analysis beginning with Pee.Â  A failure by this Court to decide the novel issue of whether carpal tunnel syndrome as a repetitive trauma injury meets the statutory mandate of section 42-15-20 at the temporal occurrence of the disabling injury would be judicial dereliction.\r\nB.Â  Analogy to Occupational Disease Cases\r\nSection 42-15-20 applies in occupational disease cases.Â  In Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985), the court of appeals explicated:\r\n\r\nThe appellants argue that Hanks failed to comply with the statutory requirement that he give notice of his injury to his employer within ninety days after its occurrence.Â  They point out that if the injury occurred on June 28, 1979, the date Hanks was diagnosed as permanently and totally disabled, Hanks did not give them notice of his injury until December 3, 1980, the date he filed the claim.\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nSection 42-15-20 requires that every injured employee or his representative give the employer notice of a job-related accident within ninety days after its occurrence.Â  Generally, the injury is not compensable if timely notice is not given.Â  In the case of occupational diseases, the â€œaccidentâ€ occurs when the employee becomes disabled and could, through reasonable diligence, discover that his condition is a compensable one.Â  Drake v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 116, 127 S.E.2d 288 (1962).\r\nSection 42-15-20 provides no specific method of giving notice, the object being that the employer be actually put on notice of the injury so he can investigate it immediately after its occurrence and can furnish medical care for the employee in order to minimize the disability and his own liability.Â  Teigue v. Appleton Co., 221 S.C. 52, 68 S.E.2d 878 (1952).\r\n\r\nId. at 381, 335 S.E.2d at 93 (emphasis added).Â  Thereafter, in Bailey v. Covil Corp., 291 S.C. 417, 354 S.E.2d 35 (1987), the supreme court held:\r\n\r\nEmployers also contend that Employee did not give timely notice of his claim.Â  An employee must give notice of an occupational disease claim within ninety days after the date he becomes disabled and could discover with reasonable diligence that his condition is compensable.Â  [White v. Orr-Lyons Mills, 287 S.C. 174, 336 S.E.2d 467 (1985); Drake v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 116, 127 S.E.2d 288 (1962); Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985)]; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985).Â  The filing of the claim in this case within ninety days of the date of disability satisfied the requirement of timely notice.\r\n\r\nId. at 419, 354 S.E.2d at 36 (emphasis added).\r\nIn Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999), the court of appeals examined the notice requirement as it applies to a claimant with an occupational disease:\r\n\r\nBard avers the Circuit Court erred in refusing to reverse the Commissionâ€™s decision that Muir gave timely notice of his claim pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985).\r\nSection 42-15-20 requires an injured employee to â€œimmediately on the occurrence of an accident, or as soon thereafter as practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer a notice of the accident.â€Â  Generally, the injury is not compensable unless notice is given within ninety days.Â  Id.Â  With an occupational disease, the â€œaccidentâ€ occurs when the employee becomes disabled and could, through reasonable diligence, discover that his condition is compensable.Â  Bailey v. Covil Corp., 291 S.C. 417, 354 S.E.2d 35 (1987); Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  In occupational disease cases, compensability accrues at the time of death or disability.Â  See Glenn v. Columbia Silica Sand Co., 236 S.C. 13, 112 S.E.2d 711 (1960).\r\nBard argues Muir did not give timely notice of injury because he was not reasonable in discovering the nature of his medical problems.Â  It does not dispute Muirâ€™s testimony that he informed his superiors at Bard in the spring of 1992 of his diagnosis and belief that he had contracted the hepatitis through handling the catheters.\r\n Notice begins to run when the employee becomes disabled and could discover with reasonable diligence his condition is compensable.Â  Muir did not become disabled by his condition until August, 1992.Â  Therefore, Muir had actually given notice of the nature of his disease before he became disabled.\r\n\r\nId. at 295, 519 S.E.2d at 598 (emphasis added).\r\nProfessor Larson declared: â€œThe optimum rule in disease cases . . . is the dual type of rule worked out judicially in California: The period begins to run when the disease has culminated in disability and when by reasonable diligence the claimant could have discovered that the condition was a compensable one.â€Â  7 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 126.10[2] (2004).\r\nC.Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\nOur research leads to the ineluctable conclusion that the efficacy of section 42-15-20 has never been analyzed in regard to a repetitive trauma injury, i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  No South Carolina case has addressed this precise question.Â  We commence our unprecedented and neoteric juridical journey in facing this novel issue by visiting other jurisdictions for edification and enlightenment.Â  When there is no case on point in South Carolina, our courts may look to other states to determine if the issue has been decided and if the decision is persuasive authority.Â  See Williams v. Morris, 320 S.C. 196, 464 S.E.2d 97 (1995); Silva v. Silva, 333 S.C. 387, 509 S.E.2d 483 (Ct. App. 1998); Golini v. Bolton, 326 S.C. 333, 482 S.E.2d 784 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe Supreme Court of Tennessee, in Lawson v. Lear Seating Corp., 944 S.W.2d 340 (Tenn. 1997), ruled that, in gradual onset injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome, the date of the accident is the date on which the injury prevents the employee from working.Â  Id. at 343; see also Central Motor Express, Inc. v. Burney, 377 S.W.2d 947 (Tenn. 1964) (noting that the beginning date for computing notice to the employer in a gradual injury case is the date on which the disability manifests itself to such an extent that employee was forced to leave work).\r\nWhen faced with this issue, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky concluded that â€œin cases where the injury is the result of many mini-traumas, the date for giving notice and the date for clocking a statute of limitations begins when the disabling reality of the injuries becomes manifest.â€Â  Randall Co. v. Pendland, 770 S.W.2d 687, 688 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).Â  The Supreme Court of Kentucky announced:\r\n\r\n[T]he notice and limitations provisions for a gradual injury are triggered when the worker becomes aware of a gradual injury and knows that it was caused by work, regardless of whether the symptoms that led to discovery of the injury later subside.Â  This approach is consistent with one of the purposes of the notice requirement, to enable the employer to take measures to minimize the workerâ€™s ultimate impairment and, hence, its liability.\r\n\r\nHolbrook v. Lexmark Intâ€™l Group, Inc., 65 S.W.3d 908, 911 (Ky. 2002).Â  Recently, the Supreme Court of Kentucky reiterated:\r\n\r\nA gradual injury generally arises imperceptibly, from the physical strain of numerous instances of minor workplace trauma, also referred to as minitrauma.Â  For that reason, the courts have applied a rule of discovery for establishing the date of injury.Â  Hence, a gradual injury becomes manifest for the purpose of notice and limitations with the workerâ€™s knowledge of the harmful change and the fact that it is caused by the work.\r\n\r\nBrummitt v. Southeastern Kentucky Rehab. Indus., 156 S.W.3d 276 (Ky. 2005).\r\nIn International Paper Co. v. Melton, 866 So. 2d 1158 (Ala. Civ. App. 2003), the trial court found: â€œRegarding the notice issue of [Meltonâ€™s] carpal tunnel claim, the courts have held that the date of injury for cumulative trauma disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome is the date of last exposure to the injurious job stimulation.â€Â  Affirming the trial court, the Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama stated:\r\n\r\nMoreover, in Zeanah v. Stewart Animal Clinic, P.C., 752 So. 2d 505, 508 (Ala. Civ. App. 1999), this court relied upon Dun &amp; Bradstreet [Corp. v. Jones, 678 So. 2d 181 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996),] in concluding that, for purposes of the notice requirements under Â§ 25-5-78, â€œ[f]or accidents or occurrences involving cumulative-stress disorders, the date of the workerâ€™s last exposure to the stressor is considered the date of the injury.â€\r\n. . . Based on the facts of this case and our holding in Zeanah, supra, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that Melton gave International Paper adequate and proper notice of his carpal tunnel syndrome claim.\r\n\r\nId. at 1162-63.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in City of Philadelphia v. Workersâ€™ Comp. Appeal Bd., 851 A.2d 838 (Pa. 2004), explained:\r\n\r\n[T]he question is a legal one concerning when the 120-day notice period in Section 311 begins to run in the case of an aggravation/ cumulative trauma injury, where the claimant suffers daily aggravation of her diagnosed condition, which becomes disabling only on her last day of employment.Â  This is a question of statutory construction . . . .\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\n. . . [I]n fixing the date of the occurrence of such an aggravation injury [carpel tunnel syndrome], it is apparent that the Commonwealth Court cases recognizing the distinct nature of such injuries are correct.Â  Thus, where as here the credited medical evidence establishes that a cumulative trauma disorder was at issue, and that conditions at work cause [a daily] aggravation of the disorder, notice must be deemed timely so long as it was given within 120 days of the last aggravation injuryâ€”which will usually be the last day at work or the day where total disability resulted.\r\n\r\nId. at 843, 847-48.\r\nThe Court of Civil Appeals of Oklahoma inculcated: â€œ[A] cumulative trauma injury is a single injury for purposes of notice and limitations.Â  The date of last exposure applies.â€Â  Fabsco Shell &amp; Tube v. Eubank, 84 P.3d 792, 796 (Okla. Civ. App. 2003) (citations omitted).\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Iowa, in Venenga v. John Deere Component Works, 498 N.W.2d 422 (Iowa Ct. App. 1993), articulated:\r\n\r\nIowa adopted the cumulative injury rule in McKeever Custom Cabinets v. Smith, 379 N.W.2d 368, 374 (Iowa 1985).Â  In McKeever, the court also addressed the question of when a cumulative injury occurs for reporting and time limitation purposes: when pain prevents the employee from continuing to work, or when the pain occasions the need for medical attention.Â  Id.Â  The court adopted the rule finding an employee is disabled and injured when, because of pain or physical inability, he or she can no longer work.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nId. at 424.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Montana reviewed the notice requirement:\r\n\r\nWe conclude that claimant satisfied the notice requirement. Since claimantâ€™s disability was the result of cumulative traumas which occurred over a period of time, the date of injury, for purposes of complying with the notice requirement, is the date on which claimant was first unable to continue with his employment due to his physical condition.\r\n\r\nBodily v. John Jump Trucking, Inc., 819 P.2d 1262, 1267-68 (Mont. 1991).\r\nIn contradistinction to a time-dated accident, this evidentiary record posits a magnitudinous presentation of a carpal tunnel syndrome accidental injury.Â  Bassâ€™ testimony and the testimony of Dr. McQueen and Dr. Seastrunk support Bassâ€™ contention that her arms gradually worsened over time to the extent that she needed medical treatment and was disabled.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule that in applying section 42-15-20 to a repetitive trauma injury, i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome, the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission shall determine the statutory notice requirement from the time of disablement of the claimant.Â  Notice begins to run when the employee becomes disabled and could discover with reasonable diligence his condition is compensable.\r\nAnalyzing the efficacy of section 42-15-20 in regard to the injury suffered and sustained by Bass, we agree with the circuit judge that Bass did not sustain a single, identifiable injury by accident in January of 2001.Â  There is NO substantial evidence in the record to support a factual finding that Bass suffered and sustained a single, identifiable injury by accident in January of 2001.Â  The only evidence in the record is that Bass suffered and sustained a repetitive trauma injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, over a period of time resulting in disability in November of 2001.\r\nWe remand to the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission to make findings of fact and conclusions of law consistent with the adoption of our holding concerning the efficacy of section 42-15-20 in a repetitive trauma injury scenario.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we AFFIRM IN RESULT and REMAND.\r\n STILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3997","title":"Floyd v.

Floyd, Sr. (Floyd Sr.) executed an amended and restated trust agreement establishing several trusts, including Trust A for the benefit of his wife, Anne.Â  Trust A is a qualified terminable interest property trust, known as a Q-Tip trust.Â  According to the trust agreement, Floyd Sr.â€™s houses and lots in Pawleyâ€™s Island, South Carolina and his stock in the Dillon Provision Company, Inc. (or the proceeds from the sale of such stock) were to fund Trust A.Â  Trust A was to be administered as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Commencing with the date of the Settlorâ€™s death, the Trustee shall pay to or for the benefit of the Settlorâ€™s wife, Anne H. Floyd, all of the net income from Trust A in convenient installments, but not less frequently than quarter-annually.Â  Any accrued and undistributed income at the death of the Settlorâ€™s wife shall be paid to her personal representatives and administrators. \r\n2. In addition, the Trustee may pay to or apply for the benefit of the Settlorâ€™s wife such sums from the principal of Trust A as in the Trusteeâ€™s sole discretion shall be necessary or advisable from time to time for the medical care, education, support and maintenance in reasonable comfort of the Settlorâ€™s wife, taking into consideration to the extent the Trustee deems advisable any other income or resources of the Settlorâ€™s wife known to the Trustee. \r\n\r\nThe trust agreement directed the remainder interest go to Floyd Sr.â€™s children upon Anneâ€™s death.Â Â  \r\nFloyd Sr. was the original trustee of the trusts.Â  Floyd Sr.â€™s son, Laurens, and his (Floyd Sr.â€™s) business associate, Bozard, were nominated to serve as co-trustees upon his death.Â  In addition, the trust agreement provided upon the death or resignation of both Laurens and Bozard, First Citizen Bank and Trust Company of South Carolina (First Citizenâ€™s) was to serve as trustee.Â Â  \r\nFloyd Sr. created a separate charitable remainder trust, under which Anne was a lifetime income beneficiary, with the remainder interest passing to several charities.Â  The charitable remainder trust document is not part of the record on appeal.Â  However, it appears from the pleadings, correspondence, and trial testimony that the trust was established March 13, 1996.Â  As the lifetime beneficiary, Anne was to receive 8% of the value of the trust each year.Â  Although the case caption suggests otherwise, Bozard did not serve with Laurens as trustee for the charitable remainder trust.Â  Laurens was the sole trustee.Â  \r\nIn February 2000, Floyd Sr. died, and Laurens and Bozard began serving as trustees of Trust A.Â  Trust A was funded with the two Pawleyâ€™s Island homes and the Dillon Provision Company stock.Â  Anne began residing in one of the Pawleyâ€™s Island homes.Â  The trust rented the other home for $400 per month.Â  \r\nApproximately a year after Floyd Sr.â€™s death, Laurens sent a letter to Anne, his stepmother, explaining the administration of Trust A.Â  Laurens wrote:\r\n\r\nDear Anne:\r\n. . . . \r\nTo facilitate the handling of the trust assets, a money market account will be opened with Edward Jones.Â  The income from the assets, currently rent from the rental house, will be deposited into this account.Â  On a quarterly basis, we will issue you a check of the accrued income from the QTIP Trust.Â  Expenses incurred by the real property of the trust such as property taxes; property casulty [sic], liability, and flood insurance; upkeep and maintenance, etc., you will then be expected to pay for.Â  Any of the above expenses which exceed the income generated by the assets of the QTIP trust are, according to the terms of the QTIP Trust, your personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnne disagreed with Laurensâ€™ interpretation of the trust agreement and sought assistance from attorney Donnie Dial.Â  Dial wrote letters to Charles Curry, the attorney for Floydâ€™s estate, asserting the trust was responsible for expenses relating to trust property.Â  Anne and Laurens engaged in several disagreements as to who was responsible for payment of various expenses related to the trust properties, including repairs to the roof of the rental house, replacement of the heat pump in Anneâ€™s house, payment of flood insurance and general property insurance, and payment of property taxes.Â  Laurens took the position that the trust was not responsible for the payment of these expenses.Â Â  Â \r\nIn October 2001, Anne brought an action in probate court against Laurens and Bozard individually and as co-trustees.Â  Anne sought an accounting of both Trust A and the charitable remainder trust, and a declaratory judgment requiring the trustees to (1) repay any advances Anne paid on behalf of Trust A, (2) reinstate flood insurance on the properties, and (3) sell the Dillon Provision Company stock and reinvest the proceeds.Â  In addition, Anne petitioned for the removal of Laurens and Bozard as co-trustees of Trust A and Laurens as trustee of the charitable remainder trust.Â  \r\nThe case was removed to the circuit court.Â  The trial judge issued an interim order, which stated: \r\n\r\n[C]ounsel for petitioner brought to the Courtâ€™s attention that the trustees are failing to pay expenses of the Trust, including but not limited to real property taxes, flood insurance, and capital improvements such as a new roof for the rental house owned by the Trust and a new heat pump for the home owned by the Trust and occupied by Mrs. Floyd. \r\n\r\nAlthough he was not prepared to rule on the interpretation of the trust provisions, the trial judge indicated his concern about the preservation of the trust property.Â  Thus, he ordered: \r\n\r\n[T]he Trust shall pay for all costs of upkeep, repair, and protection of the Trust assets, including but not limited to the taxes, insurance, repairs, and upkeep on the two Pawleyâ€™s Island houses, and that such expenses are to be paid by the trustees first out of Trust income and then, if necessary, out of Trust principal.\r\n\r\nAfter the trial judge issued this order, First Citizenâ€™s filed a motion to intervene as an interested party, which was granted.[2]Â  \r\nSubsequently, Anne filed a motion for a rule to show cause based on the trusteesâ€™ failure to comply with the trial judgeâ€™s interim order.Â  Anne argued the trust failed to pay for the installation of a new heat pump in the house in which she resides, as required by the interim order.Â  The trial judge held a hearing on this motion, found Laurens in contempt of court, and ordered him to pay attorneyâ€™s fees incurred by Anne in enforcing the order.Â  In addition, the trial judge addressed Laurensâ€™ argument that the trust was not responsible for the payment of the heat pump because of the provision in the trust agreement giving the trustee the discretionary power to invade the trust principal.Â  The trial judge determined that provision did not pertain to the expenditures for maintenance of trust property.Â  After this order, the trial judge issued another order reflecting Laurensâ€™ and Bozardâ€™s decisions to voluntarily withdraw as trustees of Trust A.Â  \r\nUltimately, the trial judge held a hearing on the merits of Anneâ€™s complaint.Â  At the hearing, Laurens objected to the admission of several letters written by Dial on behalf of Anne and letters authored by Curry.Â  Laurens argued all of the letters were written by out-of-court declarants and, therefore, constituted inadmissible hearsay.Â  In addition, he maintained the letters from Curry to Laurens were protected by the attorney-client privilege and thus were not admissible.Â  The trial judge did not rule on the admissibility of the letters, but asked the parties to submit briefs supporting their positions.Â  After the parties submitted their briefs, the trial judge ruled the Dial letters were not admitted to show the truth of the matter asserted, but â€œto show that the co-trustees were placed on notice as to [Anneâ€™s] position and to show her efforts to resolve this matter without litigation.â€Â  The judge noted Dialâ€™s opinions contained in the letters were cumulative because the court already had interpreted the trust as requiring the trustees to protect the trust property.Â  Additionally, the trial judge found the letters written by Curry to Laurens were not privileged because â€œthe advice of an attorney to the trustee is not privileged from the trust beneficiaries.â€Â  Furthermore, the trial judge stated Laurens waived the privilege by producing the letters in discovery, and opened the door to admission of the letters by claiming he followed the advice of counsel.Â  \r\nThe trial judge issued a final order finding Laurens acted in bad faith and breached his fiduciary duties to Anne by (1) failing to pay the expenses of Trust A, (2) not making timely distributions of Trust A income to Anne, (3) neglecting to provide Anne an accounting of both trusts, (4) misstating the terms of Trust A, (5) managing Trust A property solely for the benefit of the remainder beneficiaries, (6) not following the advice of counsel as to his duties as a trustee, and (7) failing to follow court orders.Â  Based on these findings, Laurens was held personally liable for $40,347.21 of Anneâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and $22,331.60 of First Citizenâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In making this determination, the trial judge stated:Â  â€œthe assessment of fees and costs against Floyd, Jr. as herein specified, is not an award of attorneysâ€™ fees, per se, but rather an assessment of sanctions against Floyd, Jr. for his contempt of court, together with an award of damages to Wife and Bank for his breach of fiduciary duty.â€Â  Further, the trial judge removed Laurens as trustee of the charitable remainder trust, explaining, â€œWhile Floyd, Jr.â€™s actions in this case were not dishonest, they strongly support his removal as trustee from any trust affecting Wife.â€Â  \r\nI.Â  Contempt and Sanctions\r\nLaurens argues the trial judge erred in finding him in contempt.Â  He asserts because all income from the trust must be paid to Anne, the trust did not have funds to pay for expenses related to the trust property. Â Therefore, he contends an invasion of the trust principal would be necessary to pay those expenses.Â  Relying on the provision of the trust granting the trustee discretion to invade the principal for Anneâ€™s benefit, Laurens argues he properly exercised his discretion and chose not to invade the principal.Â  Laurens maintains the trial judge abused his discretion in holding him in contempt for failure to pay for replacement of the heat pump in the home in which Anne resides.Â  According to Laurens, the trial judgeâ€™s order was unlawful and he was not required to obey that order. \r\nAdditionally, Laurens argues that even if the court did not err in holding him in contempt, the sanctions imposed were so disproportionate to the contempt as to constitute reversible error.Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Standard of Review\r\nA decision on contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Fagan v. Timmons, 224 S.C. 286, 78 S.E.2d 628 (1953); Tirado v. Tirado, 339 S.C. 649, 530 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œOn appeal, a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if it is without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.â€Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840 (1988) (citing Means v. Means, 277 S.C. 428, 288 S.E.2d 811 (1982); Fagan v. Timmons, 224 S.C. 286, 78 S.E.2d 628 (1953)); see also Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 120, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œA determination of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, but his discretion will be reversed when the finding is without evidentiary support or there is an abuse of discretion.â€).Â  â€œA determination of contempt is a serious matter and should be imposed sparingly; whether it is or is not imposed is within the discretion of the trial judge, which will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Haselwood v. Sullivan, 283 S.C. 29, 32-33, 320 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 312 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 1984)).\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Law/Analysis\r\n\r\n 1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Law of the Case \r\n\r\nThe finding of contempt and the award of fees are the law of the case.Â  First, a finding of contempt is immediately appealable regardless of whether damages have been determined.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 291, 513 S.E.2d 358, 364 (1999); Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 297, 609 S.E.2d 821, 837 (Ct. App. 2005); Jarrell v. Petoseed Co., 331 S.C. 207, 208, 500 S.E.2d 793, 793 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Laurens did not appeal the December 24 order finding him in contempt.Â  An unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997).Â  Therefore, the December 24 order which found Laurens in contempt and which was not appealed is the law of the case.\r\nSecond, the trial judgeâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees as both a contempt sanction and damages is the law of the case.Â  The trial judge, in his final order, directed Laurens to pay Anneâ€™s and First Citizenâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees as both damages and as a contempt sanction for his violation of the trial judgeâ€™s prior order.Â  Laurens, however, solely appeals the trial judgeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees as a contempt sanction.Â  Therefore, because the trial judge based his award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs on more than one ground, the unappealed ground becomes the law of the case.Â \r\nAnderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1996).\r\nFurther, Laurens failed to challenge the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded either during the hearing when Anneâ€™s attorney submitted his attorney fee affidavit or in a subsequent Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the trial judgeâ€™s order.Â  An issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000); Jones v. Daley, Op. No. 3951 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 22, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 92).Â  â€œImposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).Â  â€œWithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€Â  Ellie, Inc. v. Micchichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When a trial judge makes a general ruling on an issue, but does not address the specific argument raised by the appellant and the appellant does not make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal.Â \r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).\r\nAlthough the contempt finding and the award of fees are the law of the case, we nonetheless find the trial judge correctly decided both issues.Â  \r\n\r\n 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  ContemptÂ Â  \r\n\r\nAdverting our analysis to the substance of Laurensâ€™ arguments, we find them without merit.Â  â€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts.Â  Its existence is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders and writs of the courts, and consequently to the due administration of justice.â€Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1982) (citing McLeod v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, 251 S.E.2d 746 (1979); State v. Goff, 228 S.C. 17, 88 S.E.2d 788 (1955)); see also In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998) (â€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€) (citation omitted); State ex rel. McLeod v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, 251 S.E.2d 746 (1979) (instructing that a court has the inherent authority to punish offenses calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the administration of justice, and such power cannot be abridged).Â  â€œThe courtâ€™s power includes the ability to maintain order and decorum.â€Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 841 (1988).\r\nContempt results from the willful disobedience of an order of the court, and before a court may hold a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically demonstrate the acts or conduct upon which such finding is based.Â  Curlee at 382, 287 S.E.2d at 918; accord Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004); Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 606, 567 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Civil contempt must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Durlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 71, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (citation omitted).Â  A willful act is â€œone done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); accord Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nIntent for purposes of criminal contempt is subjective, not objective, and must necessarily be ascertained from all the acts, words, and circumstances surrounding the occurrence.Â  Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. at 129, 447 S.E.2d at 217 (citing State v. Bowers, 270 S.C. 124, 241 S.E.2d 409 (1978)).Â  â€œWhere a contemnor is unable, without fault on his part, to obey an order of the court, he is not to be held in contempt.â€Â  Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 301, 543 S.E.2d 271, 277 (Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nÂ â€œIn order to sustain a finding of contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to the acts or conduct upon which such finding is based.â€Â  Spartanburg County Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988) (citation omitted).Â  â€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€Â  Hawkins, 359 S.C. at 501, 597 S.E.2d at 899 (citing Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 42, 545 S.E.2d 830, 832 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  â€œOnce the movant makes a prima facie showing by pleading an order and demonstrating noncompliance, the burden shifts to the respondent to establish his defense and inability to comply.â€Â  Eaddy, 345 S.C. at 42, 545 S.E.2d at 832 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \r\nIn State v. Kennerly, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999), our supreme court noted the difference between constructive and direct contempt:Â  \r\n\r\nConstructive contempt is contempt that occurs â€œoutside the presence of the court.â€Â  [Toyota of Florence v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257,] 267, 442 S.E.2d [611,] 617 [(1994)]; State v. Johnson, 249 S.C. 1, 152 S.E.2d 669 (1967).Â  In contrast, direct contempt involves contemptuous conduct occurring in the presence of the court.Â  State v. Goff, 228 S.C. 17, 88 S.E.2d 788 (1955).\r\n\r\nId. at 620, 524 S.E.2d 838 (1999).\r\nContempt can be either civil or criminal.Â  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 502 S.E.2d 86 (1998), provides an erudite and comprehensive explication of the differences between civil and criminal contempt:\r\n\r\nThe major factor in determining whether a contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised, including the nature of the relief and the purpose for which the sentence is imposed.Â  The purpose of civil contempt is to coerce the defendant to do the thing required by the order for the benefit of the complainant.Â  The primary purposes of criminal contempt are to preserve the courtâ€™s authority and to punish for disobedience of its orders.Â  If it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.Â Â  \r\nAn unconditional penalty is criminal in nature because it is solely and exclusively punitive in nature.Â  The relief cannot undo or remedy what has been done nor afford any compensation and the contemnor cannot shorten the term by promising not to repeat his offense.Â  If the relief provided is a sentence of imprisonment, . . . it is punitive if the sentence is limited to imprisonment for a definite period.Â  If the sanction is a fine, it is punitive when it is paid to the court.Â  However, a fine that is payable to the court may be remedial when the contemnor can avoid paying the fine simply by performing the affirmative act required by the courtâ€™s order.\r\n\r\n In civil contempt cases, the sanctions are conditioned on compliance with the courtâ€™s order.Â  The conditional nature of the punishment renders the relief civil in nature because the contemnor can end the sentence and discharge himself at any moment by doing what he had previously refused to do.Â  If the relief provided is a sentence of imprisonment, it is remedial if the defendant stands committed unless and until he performs the affirmative act required by the courtâ€™s order . . . .Â  Those who are imprisoned until they obey the order, carry the keys of their prison in their own pockets.Â  If the sanction is a fine, it is remedial and civil if paid to the complainant even though the contemnor has no opportunity to purge himself of the fine or if the contemnor can avoid the fine by complying with the courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nCivil contempt must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  In a criminal contempt proceeding, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\n. . . . \r\nIn a civil contempt proceeding, a contemnor may be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred in enforcing the courtâ€™s prior order, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is not a punishment but an indemnification to the party who instituted the contempt proceeding.Â  Thus, the court is not required to provide the contemnor with an opportunity to purge himself of these attorneyâ€™s fees in order to hold him in civil contempt. Â A governmental body, as a complainant, may recover attorneyâ€™s fees in a successful contempt proceeding, provided no statute prohibits recovery.Â  Although usually a complainant is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees in a criminal contempt proceeding, depending on the circumstances, such an award may be proper.Â  After all, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees is not part of the punishment; instead, this award is made to indemnify the party for expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of the courtâ€™s order.\r\n\r\nPoston, 331 S.C. at 111-15, 502 S.E.2d at 88-91 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).Â  A criminal contemnor may not be sentenced to more than six months in prison unless he is afforded a trial by jury.Â  See State v. Passmore, ___ S.C. ___, 611 S.E.2d 273 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968)).\r\nThe trial judge issued an order requiring Laurens, as trustee, to pay all â€œcost of upkeep, repair, and protection of the Trust assets, including but not limited to the taxes, insurance, repairs, and upkeep on the two Pawleyâ€™s Island houses . . . .â€Â  Laurens clearly violated this order when he refused to pay for the heat pump for one of the homes.Â  Thus, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by finding Laurens in contempt for willfully disobeying the order.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we reject Laurensâ€™ assertion that the order was unlawful and that he therefore is excused from complying with the order.Â  The trial judge correctly interpreted the trust provisions.Â  In his order finding Laurens in contempt, the trial judge addressed Laurensâ€™ contention that the decision whether or not to invade the trust principal to pay for expenses related to the trust property was left to his and Bozardâ€™s discretion.Â  The trial judge determined the provision Laurens relies upon â€œdoes not pertain to the expenditures and maintenance of the Trust property and for Trust expenses.â€Â  We agree. \r\nThe clause in Trust A relied upon by Laurens states: \r\n\r\n2. In addition, the Trustee may pay to or apply for the benefit of the Settlorâ€™s wife such sums from the principal of Trust A as in the Trusteeâ€™s sole discretion shall be necessary or advisable from time to time for the medical care, education, support and maintenance in reasonable comfort of the Settlorâ€™s wife, taking into consideration to the extent the Trustee deems advisable any other income or resources of the Settlorâ€™s wife known to the Trustee. \r\n\r\nThis provision does not address payment of expenses relating to property of the trust.Â  We emphasize that this clause is directed towards Anneâ€™s well-being and does not concern preservation of the trust property. \r\nThe trust agreement specifically provides under the section labeled â€œTrustee Powersâ€: \r\n\r\nThe Trustee and any successors in the capacity of fiduciaries are authorized in their discretion with respect to any property, real or personal, at any time held under any provision of this Trust and without authorization by any court and in addition to any other rights, powers, authority and privileges granted by any other provision of this Trust or by statute or general rules of law (subject to the limitations of the Article immediately following this Article): \r\n. . . .\r\n26.Â  To permit the Settlorâ€™s wife to occupy rent free any residence constituting a part of the assets of a trust of which the Settlorâ€™s wife is a beneficiary and to permit any other beneficiary or beneficiaries to occupy rent free any residence constituting a part of the assets of a trust for a beneficiary or beneficiaries and to pay the real property taxes thereon, expenses of maintaining the residence in suitable repair and condition and hazard insurance premiums on the residence; provided, however, the Trustee shall not exercise this power in any way which would deprive the Settlorâ€™s wife under Trust A of the beneficial enjoyment of Trust A and the Settlorâ€™s wife shall have the right to limit, restrict, or terminate Trusteeâ€™s exercises of this power if it interferes with the beneficial enjoyment.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trust property belongs to the trust.Â  Pursuant to paragraph 26, the trustees may permit Anne or any other beneficiary to occupy rent free a residence owned by the trust.Â  However, nothing in the trust agreement authorizes the trust to require a beneficiary to pay the taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses of a trust-owned house.Â  The trust, as owner, carries the responsibility for these items. \r\nEmploying a tortured interpretation of the trust agreement, Laurens breached his duties to Anne, neglected to pay expenses of Trust A, and ignored a court order.Â  The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding Laurens in contempt.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sanctions\r\n\r\nLaurens argues that even if he was properly found in contempt, the trial judge erred in awarding sanctions in disproportion to his contempt.Â  He asserts the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees is excessive and some of the charges awarded relate to matters other than his contempt.Â  However, because the trial judge awarded the fees both as sanctions and damages, we affirm.Â Â  \r\nLaurens correctly recognizes compensatory contempt is intended to restore the injured party to his original position prior to the contemnorâ€™s action and, therefore, is limited to the partyâ€™s actual damages.Â  See Whetstone v. Whetstone,\r\n309 S.C. 227, 235, 420 S.E.2d 877, 881 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œCompensatory contempt is money awarded to a party who is injured by a contemnorâ€™s action to restore the party to his original position.Â  The award should be limited to the partyâ€™s actual loss.â€) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nCurlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 (1982), explains the law of compensatory contempt with exactitude:\r\n\r\nCompensatory contempt is a money award for the plaintiff when the defendant has injured the plaintiff by violating a previous court order.Â  The goal is to indemnify the plaintiff directly for harm the contemnor caused by breaching the injunction.Â  Rendleman, Compensatory Contempt: Plaintiff's Remedy When A Defendant Violates An Injunction, 1980 Ill.L.F. 971.Â  Courts utilize compensatory contempt to restore the plaintiff as nearly as possible to his original position.Â  Therefore it is remedial. \r\n We have recognized compensatory contempt in at least two cases.Â  In Ex Parte Thurmond, 1 Bailey 605 (1830), we stated that when an individual right is directly involved in a contempt proceeding, the court has the power to order the contemnor to place the injured party in as good a situation as he would have been if the contempt had not been committed, or to suffer imprisonment.Â  In Lorick &amp; Lowrance v. Motley, 69 S.C. 567, 48 S.E. 614 (1904), we held that a contemnor may be required to pay damages suffered by reason of his contemptuous action or suffer imprisonment.Â  The defendant was ordered to pay to the plaintiff the value of the trees he had destroyed in disregard of the courtâ€™s order. \r\nWhen . . . property of an individual is taken or destroyed in contempt of the courtâ€™s order, those interested have a right to ask of the court its restoration or payment of its value at the hands of the offender, and the court requires such restoration as part of the punishment.Â  49 S.E. at page 615. \r\nCompensatory contempt awards have been affirmed also by the United States Supreme Court. \r\nJudicial sanctions in civil contempt proceedings may, in a proper case, be employed for either or both of two purposes: to coerce the defendant into compliance with the courtâ€™s order, and to compensate the complainant for losses sustained.Â  Where compensation is extended, a fine is imposed, payable to the complainant.Â  Such fine must of course be based upon evidence of complainantâ€™s actual loss. . . . \r\n United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 304-305, 67 S.Ct. 677, 701-702, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). \r\nTherefore, the compensatory award should be limited to the complainantâ€™s actual loss.Â  Included in the actual loss are the costs in defending and enforcing the courtâ€™s order, including litigation costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The burden of showing what amount, if anything, the complainant is entitled to recover by way of compensation should be on the complainant.\r\n\r\nCurlee, 277 S.C. at 386-87, 287 S.E.2d at 919-20; accord Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 567 S.E.2d 514 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nFurther, this Court, in Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 557 S.E.2d 708 (Ct. App. 2001), wrote:\r\n\r\nCourts, by exercising their contempt power, can award attorneyâ€™s fees under a compensatory contempt theory.Â  Compensatory contempt seeks to reimburse the party for the costs it incurs in forcing the non-complying party to obey the courtâ€™s orders.Â  See Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1998) (â€œIn a civil contempt proceeding, a contemnor may be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred in enforcing the courtâ€™s prior order, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is not a punishment but an indemnification to the party who instituted the contempt proceeding.â€); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 345, 491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œA compensatory contempt award may include attorney fees.â€) (citation omitted); Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 386-87, 287 S.E.2d 915, 919-20 (1982) (â€œCompensatory contempt is a money award for the plaintiff when the defendant has injured the plaintiff by violating a previous court order . . . . Included in the actual loss are the costs of defending and enforcing the courtâ€™s order, including litigation costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.â€).\r\n\r\nHarris-Jenkins, 348 S.C. at 178-79, 557 S.E.2d at 711-12.\r\nThe trial judge awarded attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Anne not only as a sanction for Laurensâ€™ contempt, but also as â€œan award of damages to Wife and Bank for [Laurensâ€™] breach of his fiduciary duty.â€Â  Therefore, the law does not limit the award to actual damages flowing from Laurensâ€™ contempt.Â  The portion of the sum that cannot be characterized as compensatory contemptâ€”i.e., actual damages attributable to Laurensâ€™ contemptâ€”is accounted for in the additional damages award.Â  Although the fees were not awarded as attorneyâ€™s fees per se, the trial court nevertheless analyzed the attorneyâ€™s fee affidavits and found the fees reasonable pursuant to Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).Â  Thus, we find no error in the award of $40,347.21 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Anne to be paid by Laurens.Â  \r\nII.Â  Admissibility of Letters\r\nLaurens argues the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting into evidence letters written by attorneys Dial and Curry.Â  First, he contends these letters constitute inadmissible hearsay because neither Dial nor Curry testified at the trial.Â  In addition, Laurens maintains he had an attorney-client relationship with Curry, and therefore, letters written by Curry to Laurens were inadmissible pursuant to the attorney-client privilege.Â  We disagree. \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Standard of Review\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 451 S.E.2d 894 (1994)); Haselden v.

App. 1983).Â  The courtâ€™s ruling to admit or exclude evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  R &amp; G Construction at 439, 540 S.E.2d at 121; Elledge v.

Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996) (noting admission or exclusion of evidence will not be disturbed on appeal absent clear abuse).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s decision will not be reversed on appeal unless it appears he clearly abused his discretion and the objecting party was prejudiced by the decision.Â  S.C.

App. 1995); Cudd, 279 S.C. 623, 310 S.E.2d 830.\r\nThe determination whether the attorney-client privilege applies is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and his decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â \r\nRoss v.

York County Sheriffâ€™s Dept., 358 S.C. 339, 594 S.E.2d 888 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œA statement that is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted should not be excluded as hearsay.â€Â \r\nR &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000); see also State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 558, 575 S.E.2d 77, 81 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œEvidence is not hearsay unless it is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€) (citation omitted).Â  See, e.g., Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding, in a wrongful death action, that letters and a card the deceased wrote to her husband and children were not hearsay because they were offered to show the close relationship among the family and not to prove the truth of any matter asserted in the writings).\r\nFor example, in Player v. Thompson, 259 S.C. 600, 193 S.E.2d 531 (1972), the plaintiff, Player, was injured while a passenger in an automobile driven by Nancy Carder.Â  Bobby Thompson owned the car.Â  Player initiated an action against Carder for â€œheedlessness and recklessness in the operation of the automobile,â€ and she sued Bobby Thompson and his wife, Geraldine, under the family purpose doctrine for negligent entrustment of the automobile.Â  Id. at 604, 193 S.E.2d at 533.Â  A hearsay issue arose when Player sought to introduce Carderâ€™s statement\r\n\r\nthat she (Carder) went with Geraldine Thompson, two or three weeks before the collision, to a motor vehicle inspection station.Â  She said that the inspector refused Mrs. Thompson a sticker because â€˜she needed two tires.â€™Â  She stated she heard the inspector â€˜tell her (Mrs. Thompson) and she (Mrs. Thompson) told me.â€™â€”â€˜The man told her that . . . she needed two more to pass inspection.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 608, 193 S.E.2d at 534.Â  The trial court refused to admit the evidence.Â  The Player court explained:\r\n\r\nAfter the trial judge declined to admit the statement in evidence, counsel for plaintiff called defendant Carder as a witness.Â  He attempted to ask her about the inspection station incident in an effort to show that both she (Carder) and Mrs. Thompson had notice of the slick tires.Â  Defense counselâ€™s objection was sustained on the ground that it was hearsay.\r\nIn C. McCormick, Law of Evidence s 225 (1954) hearsay evidence is defined:\r\n  \r\nâ€˜Hearsay evidence is testimony in court or written evidence, of a statement made out of court, such statement being offered as an assertion to show the truth of matters asserted therein, and thus resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserted.â€™\r\n  \r\nOur Court has recognized this sound and very basic proposition in Watson v. Wall, 239 S.C. 109, 121 S.E.2d 427 (1961).Â  Also see 5 Wigmore on Evidence s 1361 (3rd ed. 1940).\r\n  \r\nâ€˜If, then, an utterance can be used as circumstantial evidence, i.e. without inferring from it as an assertion to the fact asserted, the Hearsay rule does not oppose \r\nany barrier, because it is not applicable.â€™Â  6 Wigmore on Evidence s 1788 (3rd ed. 1940).\r\n  \r\nIt would not be improper in this case for the plaintiff to elicit testimony from Nancy Carder that a filling station attendant stated to both Mrs. Thompson and her that the automobile had bad tires.Â  It would be receivable, not as a testimonial assertion by the attendant to prove the fact of slick tires, but as indicating that Nancy Carder and Mrs. Thompson obtained knowledge of the slick tires, the fact of slick tires being proved by other evidence.\r\nInasmuch as the testimony was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but solely to prove notice, which is a state of mind, the hearsay rule does not apply. \r\n\r\nPlayer, 259 S.C. at 609-10, 193 S.E.2d at 535.\r\nThe trial judge determined, and we agree, Anne offered these letters into evidence not to prove the truth of Dialâ€™s and Curryâ€™s statements, but to show the trustees were placed on notice of Anneâ€™s position as to the payment of expenses associated with trust property.Â  Additionally, admission of the Curry letters demonstrates Laurens did not follow his counselâ€™s advice.Â  The credibility of the contents of the letters was not at issue.Â  Rather, the letters are probative of (1) Laurensâ€™ awareness of Anneâ€™s position, and (2) Laurensâ€™ failure to follow the advice of his attorney.Â  \r\nFinally, Laurens was not prejudiced by the admission of the letters.Â  The trial judge had already determined in the rule to show cause hearing that Laurens had a duty to pay trust expenses and to provide an accounting of the trusts.Â  Therefore, the interpretation of the trust was not at issue when the trial judge received these letters into evidence.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the letters.Â  \r\n\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Attorney-Client Privilege\r\n\r\nThe trial judge determined admission of the Curry letters did not violate the attorney-client privilege because (1) the privilege does not apply to Anne as she is a beneficiary of the trust, and communications between a trustee and an attorney for a trust are not privileged as to trust beneficiaries; (2) even if the privilege were to apply it was waived when Laurens produced the letters in discovery; and (3) Laurens opened the door to the introduction of the letters by his repeated testimony that he relied on counselâ€™s advice.Â  We agree with each ground for admitting the letters.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\na.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Beneficiaries as Clients \r\n  \r\n\r\nWilliam F. Fratcher, IIA Scott on Trusts Â§ 173 (4th ed. 1987), declares that a â€œbeneficiary is entitled to inspect opinions of counsel procured by the trustee to guide him in the administration of the trust.â€Â  This proposition is supported by two English cases, Talbot v. Marshfield, 12 L.T.R. 761 (Ch. 1865), and Mason v. Cattley, 22 Ch.D. 609 (1883).Â  See Rust E. Reid, William R. Mureiko, &amp; Dâ€™Ana H. Hikeska, Privilege and Confidentiality Issues When a Lawyer Represents a Fiduciary, 30 Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal 541, 561 (1996).\r\n Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C. v. Zimmer, 355 A.2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), is the leading American case addressing the non-applicability of the privilege to trust beneficiaries.Â  In Riggs, the beneficiaries of a trust sought to compel production of a legal memorandum prepared by an attorney named Workman.Â  Workmanâ€™s legal fees were paid from the corpus of the trust estate.Â  The trustee refused to produce the document and claimed it was protected under the attorney-client and work product privileges.Â  The document was prepared â€œin anticipation of potential tax litigation on behalf of the trust with the State of Delaware[.]â€Â  355 A.2d at 710.Â  However, the case before the court was an unrelated surcharge claim initiated by the beneficiaries.Â  \r\nThe Riggs court concluded: â€œthe trusteeâ€™s invocation of the privileges cannot shield the document involved herein from the beneficiariesâ€™ desire to examine it.â€Â  355 A.2d at 712.Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\nThe trustee has been described as a mere representative whose function is to attend to the disposition and maintenance of the trust property so that it may be enjoyed by the beneficiaries in the manner provided by the settlor.Â  In order for the beneficiaries to hold the trustee to the proper standards of care and honesty and procure for themselves the benefits to which they are entitled, their knowledge of the affairs and mechanics of the trust management is crucial.Â  See Bogert on Trusts, 2d Ed., s 961.Â  And, when the beneficiaries desire to inspect opinions of counsel for which they have paid out of trust funds effectively belonging to them, the duty of the trustees to allow them to examine those opinions becomes even more compelling.Â  The distinction has often been drawn between legal advice procured at the trusteeâ€™s Own expense and for his Own protection and the situation where the trust itself is assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where interests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.Â  See Restatement of Trusts, 2d, s 173 comment b.\r\n\r\n355 A.2d at 712.Â  \r\n Barnett Banks Trust Co., N.A. v. Compson, 629 So.2d 849 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993), presents a scenario in which a trust beneficiary may not obtain materials prepared for the trustee.Â  In Barnett, Mr. Compson created a revocable trust with a testamentary distribution of 90% to his wife, Mrs. Compson, and 10% to his brother.Â  Barnett Bank was named trustee.Â  Shortly after creating the trust, Mr. Compson â€œchanged his directive . . . by requesting that half of the assets be transferred to Mrs. Compson individually.â€Â  Id. at 850.Â  Barnett Bank, as trustee, filed an action to determine whether the later transfer was invalid under the terms of the trust agreement.Â  Mrs. Compson counterclaimed, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.Â  Thus, in essence, by opposing Barnett Bankâ€™s position, Mrs. Compson was asserting her rights to receive assets as an individual rather than as a beneficiary of the trust.Â  \r\nMrs. Compson, relying on Riggs, requested all correspondence between the trustee and counsel.Â  The court found Riggs did not require disclosure under the facts presented.Â  The court distinguished Riggs as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Riggs courtâ€™s analysis hinges on a finding that the beneficiaries were the real clients of the trusteeâ€™s attorney.Â  Here, the real client is not Mrs. Compson.Â  The opinions and strategy relating to the litigation were provided to the trustee to enable it to regain the assets of the trust and thereby diligently administer the trust to benefit the beneficiaries.Â  Although Mrs. Compson may be a beneficiary of the trust, her position in this suit is antagonistic to the aligned beneficiaries and to her status as a beneficiary of the trust.Â  Mrs. Compson does not stand to benefit from the trusteeâ€™s actions in this suit.Â  Thus, under the Riggs analysis, she is not the real client of the trusteeâ€™s attorneys.\r\n\r\nBarnett, 629 So.2d at 851.\r\nThe Talbot case offers a paradigmatic example as it involves one document which the beneficiaries were entitled to discover and one document which was subject to the attorney-client privilege.Â  As the authors of Privilege and Confidentiality Issues explain: \r\n\r\nIn Talbot the trustee obtained an opinion of counsel that a certain advance to some of the beneficiaries was permitted under the trust instrument.Â  Funds from the trust estate were used to pay counsel for this opinion.Â  After the trustee was sued in connection with the advance, the trustee obtained another opinion of counsel concerning the proper course to take in litigation.Â  The second opinion was obtained with the trusteeâ€™s own funds.Â  The court ruled that the beneficiaries of the trust could discover the first opinion because it was obtained with trust estate funds and denied discovery of the second opinion because it was obtained with the trusteeâ€™s own funds. Although the court never called the beneficiaries â€œclientsâ€ of the trusteeâ€™s counsel, this seems to be the clear implication of the courtâ€™s reasoning.\r\n\r\nPrivilege and Confidentiality Issues at 560-61 (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\nWe find the Riggs rationale persuasive.Â  In the instant case, the contested letters pertain to the administration of the trust, not litigation between the parties.Â  Furthermore, attorney Curry was apparently compensated from the corpus of the trust.Â  Although the record is not clear as to the source of Curryâ€™s compensation, Laurens wrote him a letter asking that he â€œkeep a separate accounting of the fees generated by the estateâ€”one for the estate and one for Trust A (the QTIP trust that owns the house Anne H. Floyd occupies).Â  Trust Aâ€™s expenses should be borne by the trust and not by the beneficiaries of the estate.â€Â  Under these facts, we hold that the attorney-client privilege does not bar Anne, as beneficiary of Trust A, from access to the Curry letters which were generated prior to litigation, and which address the administration of Trust A.\r\n\r\n  \r\nb.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege\r\n  \r\n\r\nEven if the attorney-client privilege were to apply, it was waived when Laurens produced the letters in discovery.Â  The attorney-client privilege excludes from evidence confidential communications of a professional nature between attorney and client, unless the client, for whose benefit the rule is established, waives the privilege.Â  Drayton v. Industrial Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 205 S.C. 98, 31 S.E.2d 148 (1944).Â  State v. Doster, 276 S.C. 647, 284 S.E.2d 218 (1981), edifies: \r\n\r\nThe attorney-client privilege has long been recognized in this State.Â  The privilege is based upon a public policy that the best interest of society is served by promoting a relationship between the attorney and the client whereby utmost confidence in the continuing secrecy of all confidential disclosures made by the client within the relationship is maintained.Â  The privilege belongs to the client and, unless waived by him, survives even his death.Â  South Carolina State Highway Department v. Booker, 260 S.C. 245, 195 S.E.2d 615 (1973).Â  Generally, the party asserting the privilege must raise it.Â  State v. Love, [275] S.C. [55], 271 S.E.2d 110 (1980).\r\nMany jurisdictions strictly construe the privilege.Â  81 Am.Jur.2d Witnesses Â§ 174, at 210.Â  The reasoning behind the strict construction is that evidence excluded under the privilege is not necessarily incompetent. See generally, McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence, Â§Â§ 87, et seq. (2d Ed. 1972). \r\nWe agree that the privilege must be tailored to protect only confidences disclosed within the relationship. \r\n\r\nDoster at 650-51, 284 S.E.2d 219-20.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court, in Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (1981), observed:\r\n\r\nThe attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.Â  Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.Â  The privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyerâ€™s being fully informed by the client. . . . The lawyer-client privilege rests on the need for the advocate and counselor to know all that relates to the clientâ€™s reasons for seeking representation if the professional mission is to be carried out.\r\n\r\nUpjohn at 389 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\r\nIn order to protect a communication on the ground of attorney-client privilege, it must appear that the attorney was acting, at the time, as a legal advisor.Â \r\nMarshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 534, 539, 320 S.E.2d 44, 47 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Branden &amp; Nether v. Gowing, 7 Rich. 459 (S.C. 1854)).Â  Only confidential communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege.Â  Cloniger v. Cloniger, 261 S.C. 603, 193 S.E.2d 647 (1973).Â  In Ross v. Medical University of South Carolina,\r\n317 S.C. 377, 453 S.E.2d 880 (1994), the South Carolina Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\nAttorney-client privilege protects a client and any other person from disclosing confidential communications made to counsel relative to a legal matter.Â  See generally McCormick on Evidence Â§ 87 (E. Cleary, 3rd Ed. 1984).Â  However, this privilege is not absolute:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Not every communication within the attorney and client relationship is privileged.Â  The public policy protecting confidential communications must be balanced against the public interest in the proper administration of justice. This is exemplified by the widely recognized rule that the privilege does not extend to communications in furtherance of criminal tortious or fraudulent conduct. \r\n  \r\nState v. Doster, 276 S.C. 647, 651, 284 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1981) (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nRoss at 383-84, 453 S.E.2d at 884-85.\r\nThe privilege may extend to agents of the attorney.Â  For example, in State v. Hitopoulus, 279 S.C. 549, 309 S.E.2d 747 (1983), our supreme court held the attorney-client privilege extended to communications between a client and a psychiatrist retained to aid in the preparation of the clientâ€™s case.Â  As articulated in State v. Thompson, 329 S.C. 72, 495 S.E.2d 437 (1998):\r\n\r\n[I]n determining whether the attorney-client privilege extends to communications between a client and a non-lawyer, [a court] must balance two factors: (1) the need of the attorney for the assistance of the non-lawyer to effectively represent his client, and (2) the increased potential for inaccuracy in the search for truth as the trier of fact is deprived of valuable witnesses.Â  However, before reaching this test, a court must ascertain whether the communication is confidential in nature.\r\n\r\nThompson, 329 S.C. at 75, 495 S.E.2d at 438-39.\r\nThe attorney-client privilege is owned by the client and, therefore, can be waived by the client.Â \r\nSouth Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t v. Booker, 260 S.C. 245, 254, 195 S.E.2d 615, 620 (1973).Â  â€œAny voluntary disclosure by a client to a third party waives the attorney-client privilege not only as to the specific communication disclosed, but also to all communications between the same attorney and the same client on the same subject.â€Â \r\nMarshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 534, 538, 320 S.E.2d 44, 46-47 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Duplan Corp. v. Deering Milliken, Inc., 397 F.Supp 1146 (D.S.C. 1975); U.S. v. Jones, 696 F.2d 1069 (4th Cir. 1982)).\r\nIn Marshall, Mrs. Marshall inadvertently left a letter addressed to her from her attorney in Mr. Marshallâ€™s pickup truck.Â  The parties were separated at the time.Â  Mrs. Marshallâ€™s attorney had been sending copies of his correspondence with Mrs. Marshall to her father, who was the surety for payment of Mrs. Marshallâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On appeal, Mr. Marshall argued the letters from Mrs. Marshallâ€™s attorney were admissible because the attorney-client privilege had been waived.Â  We held that Mrs. Marshall did not waive the privilege by mistakenly leaving one of the letters in Mr. Marshallâ€™s truck.Â  However, we found â€œ[t]he copies of correspondence sent by Mrs. Marshallâ€™s attorney to her fatherâ€ presented â€œa different question.â€Â  Marshall at 538, 320 S.E.2d at 47.Â  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish the attorney-client privilege, it must be shown that the relationship between the parties was that of attorney and client and that the communications were of a confidential nature.Â  State v. Love, 275 S.C. 55, 271 S.E.2d 110 (1980).Â  The communication involved must relate to a fact of which the attorney was informed by his client without the presence of strangers for the purpose of securing primarily either an opinion on law or legal services or assistance in some legal proceeding.Â  SEC v. Kingsley, 510 F.Supp. 561 (D.C.D.C.1981); In Re Grand Jury Proceedings, 517 F.2d 666 (5th Cir.1975).Â  The attorney-client privilege also applies to communications originating from the lawyer rather than from the client.Â Â  When the attorney communicates to the client, the privilege applies only if communication is based on confidential information provided by the client.Â  Brinton v. Department of State, 636 F.2d 600 (C.A.D.C. 1980).Â  The attorney-client privilege, though, does not protect communications with non-clients.Â Â  State v. Love, supra.\r\n\r\nMarshall at 538-39, 320 S.E.2d at 47.Â  \r\nWe found that Mrs. Marshallâ€™s father was not a client of her attorney.Â  By sending copies of the letters to the father, Mrs. Marshallâ€™s attorney was informing a third party of the current state of his clientâ€™s lawsuit.Â  However, we found that the letter Mr. Marshall sought to admit was not relevant.Â  Therefore, the trial court was affirmed.Â  \r\nThe record indicates Laurens produced the letters he now asserts are protected by the attorney-client privilege.Â  Thus, assuming these letters were subject to the attorney-client privilege, Laurens waived that privilege by producing the letters. \r\n\r\n  \r\n c.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Open-Door Doctrine\r\n  \r\n\r\nFinally, Anne argues that Laurens opened the door to admission of the letters by his assertions at trial that he was following the advice of counsel in administering the trust.Â  \r\nThis Court recently undertook a comprehensive review of the door-opening doctrine in the criminal law context.Â  See State v. Young, Op. No. 3983 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 2, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 19 at 52).Â  The doctrine applies in the civil context as well.Â  See, e.g., Martin v. Jennings, 52 S.C. 371, 29 S.E. 807 (1898); Central of Georgia Ry. v. Walker Truck Contractors, 270 S.C. 533, 243 S.E.2d 923 (1978); Benton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Boden, 310 S.C. 400, 426 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1993); see also Brooks v. Kay, 339 S.C. 479, 486, 530 S.E.2d 120, 124 (2000) (â€œThe Dead Manâ€™s Statute will not exclude . . . testimony where the party asserting the statute â€˜opens the doorâ€™ by offering testimony otherwise excludible[.]â€).Â  \r\n\r\nOne author has stated:\r\nThe primary purpose for the rule is that of fairness and completeness of the information for making the decision.Â  If a party chooses to forego the protection of a rule by introducing evidence the opposing party would not be permitted to go into, then it is unfair not to allow the opposing party to go into the matter and provide more information to the fact-finder.\r\n\r\nDanny R. Collins, South Carolina Evidence Â§ 2.9 (2d ed. 2000).Â  \r\nAt trial, Laurens repeatedly professed that he relied on the advice of various attorneys in formulating his position regarding the expenses of Trust A.Â  Curry was not specifically named.Â  However, Laurens made several general attestations that he was following the advice of counsel.Â  For example, he averred his position was based on â€œwhat counsel had told us,â€ and declared: â€œ[t]hatâ€™s the way we were so instructed by counsel.â€Â  By these assertions, he opened the door to the admission of the letters written by Curry in which Curry informed Laurens: â€œEventually, you will have to pay the taxes[,]â€ and â€œYou certainly will want to get the insurance paid as you have an obligation to protect the property.â€Â  The letters suggest thatâ€”despite Laurensâ€™ claims to the contraryâ€”he was not following the advice of counsel.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Removal as Trustee\r\nLaurens argues the trial judge erred in removing him as trustee of Floyd Sr.â€™s charitable remainder trust.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe court, in its interim order, stated that Laurens had â€œadvised the Court that he was considering resigning as trustee of the Charitable Remainder Trust[.]â€Â  Therefore, the court ordered that he either voluntarily resign by January 31, 2003, or else provide Anne with an accounting for the trust.Â  Laurens did neither.Â  The court found Laurens had committed serious breaches of trust that strongly supported his removal as trustee from any trust affecting Anne.Â  Accordingly, the court removed Laurens as trustee of the charitable remainder trust.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Standard of Review\r\nâ€œTrusts have long and broadly been a field for the jurisdiction of equity.â€Â  Epworth Orphanage v. Long, 199 S.C. 385, 389, 19 S.E.2d 481, 482 (1942).Â  On appeal from an action in equity, tried by a judge alone, this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976); Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 531 S.E.2d 287 (2000).Â  However, we are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility.Â  Ingram at 105, 531 S.E.2d at 291.Â  \r\nThe removal of a trustee is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Thinn v. Parks, 83 S.W.3d 430, 433-34 (Ark. App. 2002) (â€œThe removal of a trustee is in the sound discretion of the trial court; its decision will not be overturned unless there is an abuse of that discretion.â€); Ivey v. Ivey, 465 S.E.2d 434, 437 (Ga. 1996) (â€œIn the absence of an abuse of discretion, a trial courtâ€™s order regarding removal of a trustee will not be reversed.â€); Matter of Estate of Atwood, 577 N.W.2d 60, 63 (Iowa App. 1998) (â€œThe trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to remove an executor or trustee.â€); Ward v. NationsBank of Virginia, N.A., 507 S.E.2d 616, 623 (Va. 1998) (â€œRemoval of a trustee is within the discretion of the trial court.Â  The trial court must determine whether it is in the best interest of the trust for the trustee to be removed.â€); Matter of Estate of Cooper, 913 P.2d 393, 401 (Wash. App. 1996) (â€œA court has a â€˜wide latitude of discretionâ€™ to remove the trustee, â€˜when there is sufficient reason to do so to protect the best interests of the trust and its beneficiaries.â€™â€) (citing Schildberg v. Schildberg, 461 N.W.2d 186, 191 (Iowa 1990)); Restatement (Second) of Trusts Â§ 107, comment a on clause (a) (â€œA court may remove a trustee if his continuing to act as trustee would be detrimental to the interests of the beneficiary.Â  The matter is one for the exercise of a reasonable discretion by the court.â€).Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Law/Analysis\r\nIn Wallace v. Foster, 15 S.C. 214 (1881), our supreme court proclaimed: \r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that a Court of Equity has full power, under proper proceedings, to remove trustees of all kinds, whether appointed by deed, will or order of court, upon good cause shown and when the exigency requires; and to substitute another instead of the one removed, and to invest him with title to and control over the trust estate.\r\n\r\nId. at 217. Â Although the Court of Equity has been abolished, \r\n\r\nThe abolition of separate courts of law and equity by the South Carolina Constitution has not deprived the court of equity of its jurisdiction over trusts, i.e., treated as a matter to be tried on [the] equity side of the court, without a jury, and subject to the rules as to appellate review.\r\n\r\nPrice v. Brown, 4 S.C. 144 (1973), quoted in Coleman Karesh, Trusts 38 (1977).Â  \r\nâ€œThe enforcement and administration of trusts has long been peculiarly within the jurisdiction of courts of equity which are jealous of the rights of cestuis que trustent [those for whose benefit the trust was createdâ€”i.e. the beneficiaries].â€Â  Weston v. Weston, 210 S.C. 1, 11, 41 S.E.2d 372, 376 (1947) (citation omitted).Â  â€œ[A] court of equity has the inherent power to exercise jurisdiction over the trust estates, to supervise their administration, and to make all orders necessary for their preservation and conservation[.]â€Â  Williams v. Duncan ex rel. Pauline M. Babock, Living Trust, 55 S.W.3d 896 (Mo. App. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also First Alabama Bank of Montgomery, N.A. v. Martin, 425 So.2d 415, 423 (Ala. 1982) (â€œSupervising the administration of trusts is a well-recognized ground of equity, . . . and the regulation and enforcement of trusts is one of the original and inherent powers of the equity court.â€).Â  â€œ[T]he probate court has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings initiated by interested parties concerning the internal affairs of trusts. . . .Â  These include, but are not limited to, proceedings to:Â  (1) appoint or remove a trustee[.]â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-201 (Supp. 2004).\r\nLuculently, in South Carolina, a court may remove a trustee pursuant to its equity power.Â  However, the case law of this State has not outlined when this power should be exercised.Â  \r\nâ€œThe court will remove a trustee if he has committed a sufficiently serious breach of trust or if it is probable that he will commit such a breach of trust or where for any other reason his continuance as trustee is likely to be detrimental to the interest of the beneficiary.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Trusts Â§ 199, comment e.Â  \r\nAccording to Scott on Trusts, a trustee will be removed\r\n\r\nif his conduct is such as to show his unfitness to administer the trust.Â  Such unfitness may be clearly shown by evidence of dishonesty.Â  He may be removed for serious breaches of trust even though the breaches of trust were not committed dishonestly.Â  The mere fact, however, that the trustee has committed breaches of trust is not necessarily a ground for his removal.Â  The trustee may be removed as a disciplinary measure, where he refuses or neglects to obey orders of the court.Â  \r\nThe question has not infrequently arisen whether the beneficiaries can force the removal of the trustee on account of friction or hostility between him and them.Â  The mere fact that there is such friction or hostility is not necessarily a sufficient ground for removal, since otherwise the beneficiaries could by quarreling with the trustee force him out. \r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nOn the other hand, where there is such friction or hostility as seriously to impede the proper performance of the trust, especially if the trustee is at fault, the trustee will be removed. \r\n\r\nWilliam F. Fratcher, 2 Scott on Trusts Â§ 107 (4th ed. 1987) (footnotes omitted).Â  Although â€œ[t]he court is less ready to remove a trustee who was named by the settlor . . . [,] [i]f the ground for removal did not exist at the time the settlor named the trustee or it was not know to the settlor, the court will not hesitate to remove him.â€Â  2 Scott on Trusts Â§ 107.1.Â  Bogert, in The Law of Trusts and Trustees Â§ 519 (Rev. 2d ed.), observes: â€œWhen in the course of the administration of a trust it becomes apparent that the trustee can not, in fairness to the beneficiaries, be allowed to continue in the exercise of his powers, he may be removed.â€Â  \r\nOther jurisdictions have found a trustee may be judicially removed for neglect to perform duties, breach of trust, failure to comply with a court order, and hostility between the trustee and beneficiaries.Â  For example, in Ackley v. Loughlin, 406 So.2d 832 (Ala. 1981), the settlorâ€™s widow filed an action to have her stepdaughter removed as trustee.Â  The widow was an income beneficiary of the trust, and the settlorâ€™s daughter was the remainder beneficiary.Â  The trial court removed the settlorâ€™s daughter as trustee for, among other reasons, â€œhostility between the parties, delays in furnishing of money to the widow, and a controversy concerning [the daughterâ€™s] unauthorized use of some of the assets of the estate.â€Â  Id. at 833.Â  The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed, finding â€œan abundance of evidence of such hostility as justified the removal of Mrs. Ackley.Â  Among other things, she quite evidently treated her stepmother very high-handedly and arbitrarily.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Hargraves v. Hargraves, 686 S.W.2d 816 (Ark. Ct. App. 1985), the Arkansas Court of Appeals reviewed a trial courtâ€™s removal of the settlorâ€™s son as trustee.Â  The sonâ€™s mother was a beneficiary of the trust.Â  â€œThe trial court removed the trustee partly on the basis of the hostility and animosity which the trustee held for his mother, the principal beneficiary under the trust.â€Â  Id. at 818.Â  On appeal, the court noted: â€œThe decision was soundly bottomed in fact and law.â€Â  Id.  \r\nThe Supreme Court of California, in In re Gilmakerâ€™s Estate, 371 P.2d 321 (Cal. 1962), reversed the trial courtâ€™s refusal to remove a trustee where the court found adequate grounds for removal.Â  Among other reasons, the trustee refused to provide an accounting.Â  The court noted that â€œ[h]ostility between the beneficiary and the trustee is a ground for removal of the trustee when the hostility impairs the proper administration of the trust.â€Â  Id. at 324 (citations omitted).\r\n Matter of Maloneâ€™s Estate, 597 P.2d 1049 (Colo. Ct. App. 1979), affirmed the probate courtâ€™s removal of the respondent as co-trustee of three separate trusts.Â  The court observed: \r\n\r\nProper grounds for removal include the existence of hostility and friction between the trustee and the beneficiaries, or between the trustee and his co-trustees, causing interference with the proper administration of the trust.Â  Also, where ill-feeling between the trustee and the beneficiaries or between the trustee and his co-trustees reaches such a level that future cooperation and proper administration become improbable, the trustee may be removed even if misconduct is not proven.Â  The courtâ€™s paramount regard must be for the interest of the trust and the rights of the beneficiaries.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 1050 (citations omitted).Â  The Colorado Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion in the probate courtâ€™s determination that the best interests of the beneficiaries would be served by removal of the respondent as co-trustee.Â  \r\nThe Indiana Appellate Court reversed the probate court for failure to remove a trustee.Â  Helm v. Odle, 157 N.E.2d 584 (Ind. App. 1959).Â  The appellate court found \r\n\r\na serious failure by the appellee administratrix to handle and conduct the trust reposed in her with the â€˜scrupulous integrityâ€™ required of such trustees.Â  It is our opinion that such breach of her trust by said appellee rendered her unsuitable and disqualified from further exercise of said trust.\r\n\r\nId. at 585-86.\r\nIn Wilson v. Wilson, 14 N.E. 521 (Mass. 1888), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts decreed: â€œAs to the removal of trustees without misconduct attributable to hostility, courts will remove them whenever it is essential to the due exercise of the trust, even when they have been guilty of no misconduct and wish to remain.â€Â  Id. at 522.\r\nIn Maydwell v. Maydwell, 185 S.W. 712 (Tenn. 1916), the daughter of the testator and income beneficiary of a trust sought to have her mother removed as trustee.Â  The court had no doubts about the â€œhonesty or acumenâ€ of the mother and found she had managed the estate well.Â  However, the evidence showed the relationship between the mother and daughter was such that â€œit would be inadvisable and prejudicial to the best interests of both and of the estate for [the mother] to be continued as trustee.â€Â  Id. at 713.Â  Thus, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the lower courtâ€™s decision to leave the mother as trustee.Â  \r\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court, in In re Hillâ€™s Estate, 75 N.W.2d 582 (1956), acknowledged: â€œThe failure or refusal of a trustee to obey lawful orders of the court with respect to the trust is ground for his removal.â€Â  Id. at 592 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn consonance with the foregoing, we hold that a trustee may be removed: (1) where the trustee is found unfit because of (a) dishonesty, (b) serious breaches of trust, or (c) failure to adequately perform trustee duties; (2) for refusal to obey orders of a court directed to the trustee in his role as trustee; and (3) where hostility between the trustee and the beneficiaries impedes the proper administration of the trustâ€”especially where the trustee is at fault.Â  The question of removal is directed to the sound discretion of the presiding judge.Â  The appellate tribunals may find facts in accordance with their own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\nIn the instant case, we find multiple grounds for removing Laurens as trustee of the charitable remainder trust.Â  First, Laurens ignored the trial courtâ€™s order by failing to provide Anne with an accounting of the trust.Â  The trial judge did not err in removing Laurens for his contempt.Â  \r\nSecond, we find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s finding that Laurensâ€™ actions â€œstrongly support his removal as trustee from any trust affecting Wife.â€Â  The trial judge found Laurens acted in bad faith and breached his fiduciary duty owed to Anne by (1) failing to pay expenses of Trust A, (2) failing to make timely distributions of Trust A income to Anne, (3) failing to provide an accounting of the charitable remainder trust to Anne, (4) misstating the terms of Trust A, (5) managing Trust A property solely for the benefit of the remainder beneficiaries, (6) failing to follow the advice of counsel as to his duties as a trustee, and (7) failing to follow orders of the court.Â  \r\nLaurens argues there is no evidence he has mishandled his duties as trustee of the charitable remainder trust, and therefore, the trial court erred in removing him simply because of his conduct with respect to Trust A.Â  He cites Crayton v. Flower, 140 S.C. 517, 139 S.E. 161 (1927), in support of his position.Â  In Crayton, the trustee improperly invested trust funds in a note and mortgage in violation of the directions contained in the trust document.Â  Id. at 518, 139 S.E. at 161.Â  Although the court found the trustee liable for the resulting loss on the investment, it determined because the trusteeâ€™s actions were performed in good faith, they were not grounds for removal.Â  Id. at 521, 139 S.E. at 162.Â  Laurens asserts that in Crayton even negligence did not support removal; and since he has done no wrong in administering the charitable remainder trust, there is no support for removal here.Â  \r\nInitially, we reject Laurensâ€™ claims of innocence as to the charitable remainder trust.Â  He neglected to provide Anne with an accounting and violated a court order.Â  Indeed, in Crayton, the trusteeâ€™s negligence did not require his removal, but the court did order him to enter a $7,500 bond.Â  The court â€œfurther ordered that if [the trustee] fails to execute and file the bond above required within the time mentioned, or fails to do or perform any of the other matters and things required of him in this decree, then and in such event the said [trustee] is hereby removed as trustee of said trust estate[.]â€ Crayton, 140 S.C. at 521, 139 S.E. at 162. Thus Crayton firmly supports the removal of a trustee who violates a court order related to the trust.Â  \r\nFurthermore, were we to find Laurens innocent of wrongdoing as to the charitable remainder trust, which we do not, we reject his argument that wrongdoing as trustee of Trust A has no bearing on the question of his removal as trustee of another trust where the trusts share a beneficiary.Â  Laurensâ€™ misconduct as trustee of Trust A is relevant to whether he should continue as trustee of the charitable remainder trust where the trusts share a common beneficiary.Â  Because Laurens has demonstrated his inability to honor his fiduciary duties and properly administer Trust A, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Laurens is unfit to be trusted with the administration of the charitable remainder trust of which Anne is likewise a beneficiary.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s removal of Laurens as trustee of the charitable remainder trust.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Laurens did not appeal the trial judgeâ€™s order finding him in contempt of court, we find this decision to be the law of the case.Â  Regardless, the contempt finding was a proper exercise of the courtâ€™s discretion.Â  We affirm award of fees as a combination of sanctions and damages.Â  Further, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit into evidence letters written by Dial and Curry.Â  The letters are not hearsay, and they are not protected by the attorney-client privilege.Â  Finally, the trial judge did not err in his decision to remove Laurens as trustee of the charitable remainder trust.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] First Citizenâ€™s Bank and Laurens entered into a settlement agreement during the pendency of this appeal resolving all matters between them.Â  Therefore, First Citizenâ€™s Bank is not a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3998","title":"Anderson v.

Anderson, Robert Ressler, Diane Ressler, William Todt, Thomas A. Brooks, Juliana S. Calhoun, Robin Lee, Keith Lee, Donald J. Hatcher, Michele B. Hatcher, Philip D. Lanfried, and Jean F. Landfried (collectively â€œthe Neighborsâ€), sued Hank and Linda Buonforte (collectively â€œthe Buonfortesâ€), seeking to enforce the restrictive covenants of the Indian Hills Subdivision in Sumter, South Carolina.Â  The special referee ordered the Buonfortes to remove a two-car garage from their property and modify a recently built extension to their home.Â Â  Both parties appeal.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Buonfortes began construction of a house in the Indian Hills Subdivision in Sumter, South Carolina.Â Â  Hank Buonforte convinced his parents to move into his home, promising to build an extension to the main house (â€œthe mother-in-law wingâ€). Thereafter, he approached the City Planning Directorâ€™s Office for a variance to his permit and applied to the Sumter City-County Board of Appeals (â€œthe Boardâ€) for a variance to the cityâ€™s setback requirements to build a garage. However, at the Buonfortesâ€™ hearing before the Board, several neighbors appeared in opposition to the request. \r\nThe Buonfortes applied for a variance with the subdivisionâ€™s designated representative for enforcement of the restrictive covenants.Â  However, eighteen days later, before the Buonfortes received a response from the representative, the Neighbors sued the Buonfortes, alleging the Buonfortesâ€™ mother-in-law wing and garage violated the communityâ€™s restrictive covenants because:Â  1) the main structure was no longer a single-family dwelling; and 2) the house no longer complied with the setback lines.Â  Additionally, the Neighbors sought a temporary restraining order prohibiting any further construction on the lot. \r\nAfter a full hearing on the merits, the special referee ruled the home was a single-family dwelling within the meaning of the term in the restrictive covenants.Â  Furthermore, the special referee determined the house violated â€œthe general scheme of developmentâ€ and ordered the garage removed and the â€œmother-in-law wingâ€ altered to better conform to surrounding houses.Â  The special referee also ordered the Buonfortes to pay all court costs and special referee fees.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to enforce a restrictive covenant is in equity.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  As such, this court may view the facts in accordance with our preponderance of the evidence.Â  However, we should not disregard the findings of the special referee, who was in a better position to weigh the credibility of witnesses.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Neighborsâ€™ Appeal\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  â€œSingle-Family Dwellingâ€\r\nInitially, the Neighbors argue the special referee erred by failing to rule on whether the Buonfortesâ€™ house was a single-family dwelling or a duplex.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn appellate court must view the trial courtâ€™s statements as a whole to determine its reasoning.Â  State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 584, 582 S.E.2d 407, 410 (2003).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n order should be construed within the context of the proceeding in which it is rendered.â€Â  Dibble v. Sumter Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 283 S.C. 278, 282, 322 S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. App. 1984); see also Eddins v. Eddins, 304 S.C. 133, 135, 403 S.E.2d 164, 166 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding judgments are to be construed as other instruments, and the determinative factor is the intention of the court, considering the judgment in its entirety).Â  \r\nThe special refereeâ€™s order specifically found the Buonfortesâ€™ house, â€œconstitutes a single family unit as defined by the restrictive covenants.â€ Thus, the Neighborsâ€™ claim is without merit.\r\nNext, the Neighbors assert the contrary argument that the special referee erred by ruling on whether the Buonfortesâ€™ structure constituted a single-family dwelling or a duplex. They contend this issue was neither raised by the pleadings nor argued at trial.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œA judgment must conform to the pleadings and be in accordance with the theory of action upon which the case was tried.â€Â  Chandler v. Merrel, 291 S.C. 227, 228, 353 S.E.2d 135, 136 (1987).Â Â  However, â€œ[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.â€Â  Rule 15(b),\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp; \r\nIn pertinent part, the Neighborsâ€™ complaint alleges, â€œthe . . . [Buonfortesâ€™] construction . . . violate[s] the restrictive covenants in the following particulars:Â  . . . The . . . [Buonfortes] are developing and/or constructing a residence and attached apartment/duplex which is in clear violation of the limit to a single family residence . . . .â€Â  Furthermore, during the trial, both the Neighbors and the Buonfortes presented extensive testimony about whether the structure was a single-family dwelling or a duplex.Â  Neither party objected to the admission of the testimony.Â  Thus, this issue was both raised in the pleadings and tried by consent during the trial.Â  Consequently, this issue is without merit.\r\nNext, the Neighbors argue the special referee erred by considering the testimony of two of the Buonfortesâ€™ witnesses.Â  Specifically, the Neighbors claim the testimony was irrelevant.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAny evidence that assists in getting at the truth of the issue is relevant and admissible, unless because of some legal rule it is incompetent.â€Â  Toole v. Salter, 249 S.C. 354, 361, 154 S.E.2d 434, 437 (1967).Â  Furthermore, \r\n\r\n[i]n determining a dispute concerning the relevancy of . . . evidence, the question to be resolved is as to whether there is a logical or rational connection between the fact which is sought to be presented and a matter of fact which has been made an issue in the case. Relevancy is that quality of evidence which renders it properly applicable in determining the truth and falsity of matters in issue between the parties to a suit. All that is required to render evidence admissible is that the fact shown thereby legally tends to prove, or make more or less probable, some matter in issue, and bear directly or indirectly thereon. \r\n\r\nId.Â  (internal citations omitted).Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen a term is not defined within a contract, evidence of its usual and customary meaning is competent to aid in determining its meaning.Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Oates, 356 S.C. 378, 382-83, 588 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThe restrictive covenant states only single-family dwellings are permitted on the Buonfortesâ€™ property.Â  Furthermore, the covenant expressly prohibits the construction of duplexes.Â  However, neither â€œsingle-family dwellingâ€ nor â€œduplexâ€ is defined within the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\nThus, attempting to demonstrate the house was a single-family dwelling, the Buonfortes presented the testimony of William Henry Hoge, the Planning Director for the Sumter Planning Commission, and John Humphries, the Building Official for the City of Sumter, who testified that pursuant to the applicable Sumter zoning ordinances, the Buonfortesâ€™ house was a single-family dwelling.Â Â  The Neighbors objected, arguing only the testimony of Robert Ross Dinkins, the person responsible for enforcing the restrictive covenants, was relevant on the issue.Â  \r\nWe conclude the admitted testimony was relevant to determine the meaning of the term â€œsingle-family dwellingâ€ within the restrictive covenants, as the zoning ordinances were evidence of its usual and customary meaning.Â  Thus, the special referee did not err by admitting the testimony.\r\nLastly, the Neighbors argue the special referee abused his discretion by ruling the Buonfortesâ€™ structure was a single-family dwelling.Â  We disagree.\r\nDinkins testified he was responsible for enforcing the restrictive covenants, and, in his opinion, the structure was a duplex.Â  The Neighbors also admitted the testimony of Charles R. McCreight, an architect, who opined the structure was a duplex.Â  \r\nIn response, the Buonfortes presented the testimony of Hoge and Humphries.Â  Hoge testified it was his duty to enforce the zoning ordinances of the City of Sumter.Â  Additionally, he testified the Indians Hills Subdivision is within the City of Sumter, zoned in an area where duplexes are prohibited.Â  In his opinion, the structure constituted a single-family residence under the applicable Sumter zoning ordinances.Â  Humphries, who is responsible for enforcing the City of Sumter building regulations, testified the structure was a single-family dwelling and did not meet the definition of a duplex within the building code definition.Â  \r\nViewing the entirety of the record, we agree with the special referee that the weight of the evidence indicates the Buonfortesâ€™ structure was a single-family dwelling for purposes of the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Notice of Restrictive Covenants\r\nThe Neighbors argue the special referee erred by finding the Buonfortes were not on notice of the restrictive covenants. The Neighbors misunderstand the special refereeâ€™s ruling.\r\nAn appellate court must view the trial courtâ€™s statements as a whole to determine its reasoning.Â  Evans, 354 S.C. at 584, 582 S.E.2d at 410.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n order should be construed within the context of the proceeding in which it is rendered.â€Â  Dibble, 283 S.C. at 282, 322 S.E.2d at 677; see also Eddins, 304 S.C. at 135, 403 S.E.2d at 166 (holding judgments are to be construed as other instruments, and the determinative factor is the intention of the court, considering the judgment in its entirety).Â  \r\nConstructive notice and actual notice are not one and the same.Â \r\nStrother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 64, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 (1998).Â  Rather, a person has actual notice â€œwhere the person . . . either knows of the existence of the particular facts in question or is conscious of having the means of knowing it, even though such means may not be employed by him.â€Â Â  Id. at 64 n. 6, 504 S.E.2d at 122 n. 6.Â  In contrast, â€œconstructive notice is a legal inference which substitutes for actual notice. It is notice imputed to a person whose knowledge of facts is sufficient to put him on inquiry; if these facts were pursued with due diligence, they would lead to other undisclosed facts.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œA homeowner is charged with constructive notice of any restriction properly recorded within the chain of title.â€Â \r\nHarbison Comm. Assâ€™n, Inc., v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 99, 103, 459 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe Buonfortes bought a piece of property in the Indian Hills Subdivision with restrictive covenants in the chain of title.Â  The Buonfortes denied actual notice of the restrictive covenants.Â  The Neighbors did not present any evidence within the record indicating the Buonfortes were on actual notice of the restrictive covenants.\r\nIn the findings of fact, the special refereeâ€™s final order states that the Buonfortesâ€™ deed did not put the Buonfortes on â€œadequateâ€ notice of the restrictive covenants.Â  Subsequently, as a conclusion of law, the special referee held the Buonfortes were unaware of the restrictive covenants when they began building the garage and mother-in-law wing.Â  \r\nWe conclude a reasonable reading of the special refereeâ€™s order, in light of the proceedings in which it was rendered, indicates the special referee found the Buonfortes were not on actual notice, as opposed to constructive notice, of the restrictive covenants.Â  Furthermore, this finding is supported by the weight of the evidence within the record.Â  Thus, we hold the special referee did not err. \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Balancing of the Equities\r\nThe Neighbors argue the special referee erred by balancing the equities in an arbitrary and unfair manner.Â  Specifically, the Neighbors contend the Buonfortes came to the hearing with â€œunclean hands,â€ and thus, both the mother-in-law wing and the garage should be removed.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen this court is sitting in equity, and thus viewing evidence for its preponderance, we are to consider the equities of both sides, balancing the two to determine what, if any, relief to give.Â  See Foreman v. Foreman, 280 S.C. 461, 464-65, 313 S.E.2d 312, 314 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, if a party has unclean hands, the party is precluded from recovering in equity.Â  A party will have unclean hands where the party behaves â€œunfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation to the prejudice of the defendant.â€Â Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 107, 531 S.E.2d 287, 292 (2000). \r\nThe Neighbors sued the Buonfortes, seeking to enforce the restrictive covenants of the Indian Hills Subdivision.Â  Specifically, the Neighbors argued the additions to the Buonfortesâ€™ house created a duplex; the mother-in-wing and garage violated the setback lines; and the mother-in-law wing and garage did not conform with the aesthetics of the neighborhood.Â  \r\nWhile the litigation was pending, the parties signed a consent order providing the following:\r\n\r\nORDERED, that the . . . [Buonfortes] immediately cease any further construction regarding the â€œmother-in-law wingâ€ on the property . . . . The . . . [Buonfortes] will be permitted to install the front window units of said wing along with the door, and can also complete the sides and rear of said wing, however, the . . . [Buonfortes] may not continue to build or improve the front of the structure.Â  Further, the . . . [Buonfortes] may not destruct or improve the wall separating the â€œmother-in-lawâ€ wing from the main structure . . . . ORDERED, that the . . . [Buonfortes] be allowed to complete the main structure of said building . . . Further, the . . . [Buonfortes] will be allowed to complete the interior of the balance of the structure . . . and the exterior of the entire structure . . . ORDERED, that if the . . . [Buonfortes] do continue to build or improve said property beyond the parameters of this Order, that the . . . [Buonfortes] do so at their own risk[.]\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nSubsequently, the Buonfortes completed construction of the garage and interior of the mother-in-law wing.Â  Following a final hearing, the special referee ruled the Buonfortes must remove the garage.Â  Furthermore, the special referee ruled the Buonfortes must remove the front door entrance of the mother-in-law wing, such that the house now only has one front entrance.Â  Moreover, the special referee ordered the Buonfortes to remove the gabled entrance roof.Â  \r\nThe Neighbors now contend the special referee erred by balancing the equities to allow the mother-in-law wing to remain because the Buonfortes are seeking equity with unclean hands.Â  Specifically, the Neighbors allege the following particulars weigh against the Buonfortes:Â  1) the Buonfortes misrepresented information on their original building permit because they did not request a permit for the additions to the house, although they knew they planned to construct additions; 2) the Buonfortes had constructive knowledge of the restrictive covenants before they began to build the additions to their house; and 3) the Buonfortes continued to build after they had actual knowledge of the restrictive covenants.\r\nWe do not view the evidence in the same light as the Neighbors.Â  Rather, our view of the evidence indicates the Buonfortes applied for a building permit to construct their original residence.Â  Although the Buonfortes may have intended to construct additions to their residence when they applied for the original building permit, they did not intend to do so without acquiring an additional permit.Â  In fact, prior to construction of the additional structures, the Buonfortes applied for permits to build the additional structures, leading to this lawsuit.\r\nThe evidence also indicates the Buonfortes were not on actual notice of the restrictive covenants, as no evidence exists within the record indicating they actually knew the restrictive covenants existed.Â  Rather, the evidence indicates that prior to buying the piece of property, the Buonfortes hired an attorney to conduct a title search.Â  The attorneyâ€™s report does not indicate the existence of restrictive covenants.Â  Thus, although the Buonfortes were on constructive notice of the restrictive covenants, they were not on actual notice, mitigating any allegation of unclean hands.\r\nPursuant to the above quoted agreement, the Buonfortes continued to build the additions to their home after commencement of this lawsuit.Â  With the exception of the garage, which the special referee ordered the Buonfortes to remove, the continued building was permitted under the agreement.Â  \r\nWe conclude the Buonfortes did not have unclean hands such that they are precluded from the aid of equity, as they have not acted unfairly to the prejudice of the Neighbors.Â  Moreover, we conclude the special referee appropriately weighed the equities of the situation.Â  Thus, we hold the special referee did not err. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Buonfortesâ€™ Appeal\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  General Scheme of Development\r\nThe Buonfortes argue the special referee erred by ordering them to remove the garage and alter the mother-in-law wing.Â  They contend Dinkins implicitly approved their construction plans pursuant to an automatic approval provision in the restrictive covenants.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined by the contract language.â€Â \r\nSchulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  Thus, â€œ[i]f the contractâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force and effect.â€Â  Id.Â  Where a restriction on land is capable of two different constructions, the construction which least restricts the property is favored. See Hamilton v. C.M., Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 157, 263 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1980) (â€œA restriction on the use of the property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.â€).Â  \r\nThe restrictive covenants provide, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nNo building, fence, or other structure of any kind shall be begun, erected, or placed on any of the lots [in the neighborhood] until the building plans, specifications, design and plat plan showing the location of such building, fence, or structure on the lot in question has first been approved by Robert Ross Dinkins . . . .Â  In the event Robert Ross Dinkins, or his designated representative, fails to approve or disapprove within thirty days after plans and specifications have been submitted to him, or in the event no suits to enjoin the construction have been commenced prior to the completion thereof, approval will not be required and the related covenants shall be deemed to have been fully complied with.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  The Buonfortes argue that because they submitted their building plans to Dinkins and those plans were not approved or disapproved within thirty days, they were free to begin building their home despite the lawsuit filed by the Neighbors.Â  The Neighbors argue that Dinkinsâ€™ approval became immaterial once they filed their action for an injunction before the Buonfortes completed construction.Â  \r\nTo interpret the covenant as the Buonfortes urge, we would have to construe the above language as providing two separate and distinct exceptions to the general rule requiring prior approval: (1) when homeowners submit plans to Dinkins and he fails to approve or disapprove of the plans within thirty days; or (2) when homeowners do not submit plans to Dinkins, but they finish building before any lawsuit to enjoin construction is filed. Based on that interpretation, the Buonfortes would not be bound by the restrictive covenants because they submitted their plans to Dinkins, and he failed to approve or disapprove of those plans within thirty days.[1] Â Â Although this is a logical interpretation, the covenant, as written, does not explicitly state that the second exception only applies when homeowners choose not to submit plans to Dinkins.\r\nThe Neighbors, on the other hand, urge us to find that the Buonfortes are bound by the covenants because a lawsuit to enjoin the construction was filed before the Buonfortesâ€™ home was completed.[2]Â  To construe the covenant as the Neighbors urge, we would have to interpret the above excerpted language to provide only one exception to the prior-approval rule: when homeowners submit plans to Dinkins, he fails to approve or disapprove of those plans within thirty days, and no lawsuit to enjoin the construction is filed prior to the completion of construction.Â  However, the covenant, as written, uses the disjunction â€œorâ€ rather than the conjunction â€œandâ€ between the phrases, indicating there are two separate exceptions to the rule requiring prior approval.\r\nAlthough both the Buonfortesâ€™ and the Neighborsâ€™ interpretations of the covenant are logical, both interpretations require us to read words into the covenant that simply are not there.Â  Because two logical interpretations of the same language are possible, we adopt the Buonfortesâ€™ construction because it is the less restrictive of the two.Â  See Hamilton, 274 S.C. at 157, 263 S.E.2d at 380 (â€œA restriction on the use of the property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nWe therefore find the Buonfortes were free to build the garage and mother-in-law wing pursuant to the plans they submitted to Dinkins because Dinkins failed to approve or disapprove of those plans within thirty days.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the special refereeâ€™s order requiring the Buonfortes to remove the garage and alter the mother-in-law wing.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Fees and Costs\r\nThe Buonfortes argue the special referee erred by ordering them to pay all of the fees and costs of the litigation.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œIn every civil action commenced or prosecuted in the courts of record in this State . . . the attorneys for the plaintiff or defendant shall be entitled to recover costs and disbursements of the adverse party.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-10 (1977); see Rule 54(d), SCRCP (â€œ[C]osts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.â€).Â  However, â€œ[n]o costs will be allowed to any party unless he succeed, in whole or in part, in his claim or defense, unless otherwise directed by the judge hearing the cause.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-20 (1977).Â  \r\nBecause we reverse the portion of the special refereeâ€™s order requiring the Buonfortes to tear down their garage and to alter the faÃ§ade of the mother-in-law wing, the Neighbors no longer succeeded on any issue they brought before the special referee.Â  Thus, they are not entitled to recover any attorneyâ€™s fees or costs from the Buonfortes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-20.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the special referee is\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n WILLIAMS, J., concurs and KITTREDGE, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which reverses the order of the special referee.Â  I would affirm the order of the special referee in its entirety.\r\nAs an initial matter, I would adhere to this courtâ€™s prior opinion in Anderson v. Buonforte, Op. No. 2004-UP-270 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 19, 2004) and dismiss the petition for rehearing as improvidently granted.Â  \r\nIn this equitable action to enforce restrictive covenants, as noted by the majority, we may find the facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  We do, however, recognize that the special referee was in a better position to weigh the credibility of the witnesses.Â  \r\nThe Buonfortes began construction with no regard for the restrictive covenants.Â  Hank Buonforte comes to this equitable litigation with unclean hands.Â  Mr. Buonforte engaged in a pattern of deceit throughout the process.Â  To facilitate approval of the construction loan from the bank, Mr. Buonforte signed the name of Terry Osteen, a licensed contractor who had nothing to do with the construction.Â  Mr. Buonforte also altered the survey prepared by Joseph Edwards to give the false impression that the proposed construction would be completed within the set-back requirements.Â  Mr. Buonforte further submitted a permit for a 3,500-square-foot home, although he planned all along to build a structure in excess of 5,000 square feet.Â  \r\nIn March of 2001, the Buonfortes were formally notified of their violation of the restrictive covenants.Â  The Buonfortes were required to submit â€œplans and specificationsâ€ for review, but Mr. Buonforte only submitted a purposefully vague description of the construction plans, described in the record as a â€œfootprint.â€Â  Robert Ross Dinkins, pursuant to the restrictive covenants, reviewed the incomplete plans and specifications and responded by letter dated April 4, 2001.Â  The critical portion of Mr. Dinkinsâ€™ response to Mr. Buonforte reads:\r\n\r\nYou are aware that submission of plans, specs [sic], and plot plan is a requirement and their approval before construction begins, according to recorded documents, i.e., restrictive covenants. \r\n\r\nI construe this language as disapproving of further construction, pending receipt of further and more specific information.[3]Â  Mr. Buonforte ignored the April 4 letter of Mr. Dinkins and continued construction.Â  In light of these circumstances, numerous landowners in the Indian Hills subdivision promptly filed suit seeking to enforce the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\nThe special referee considered the evidence and, in my judgment, reached a fair and equitable result in this difficult case.Â  I would affirm the order of the special referee, including the award of fees and costs and the requirement that the Buonfortes remove the garage and alter the mother-in-law wing.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] The Neighbors argue that Dinkins disapproved of the Buonfortesâ€™ plans in a letter dated April 4, 2001.Â  In that letter, Dinkins explained that the request for variance and the size of the Buonfortesâ€™ home was â€œabove and beyond the normal for the areaâ€; however, rather than deny the plans as submitted, Dinkins wrote that he did not have â€œthe ability to pass judgment.â€Â  We do not interpret this letter as a denial of the Buonfortesâ€™ plans.\r\n[2] In fact, the Neighborsâ€™ lawsuit was filed only eighteen days after the Buonfortes submitted their plans to Dinkins.Â  Although they believe that the swiftness with which they filed suit strengthens their case, they do not believe filing during Dinkinsâ€™ thirty-day response period was critical to their lawsuit.\r\n[3] Mr. Dinkins testified similarly at the hearing: â€œIâ€™ve never approved [the plans]. I donâ€™t intend to approve them. They do not meet the requirements of the restrictive covenants[,] . . . esthetically or harmoniously.â€Â  When asked about Mr. Buonforteâ€™s intentions, Mr. Dinkins responded, â€œI could not know what he plans to do. Heâ€™s never supplied the plans and specifications.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3999","title":"Roberts v.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3999\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2005 â€“ Filed June 13, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThomas R. Goldstein, of Charleston, for Appellant.Â  \r\nJ. Hubert Wood, III, James R. Porter, Jr., and J.&nbsp;Alexandra van Staveren, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Carol Roberts appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the workersâ€™ compensation commissionâ€™s decision to calculate her compensation rate without considering merit raises she received after her injury.Â  Additionally, Roberts appeals the decision to count â€œhalf weeksâ€ of work against the allocated recovery period.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS \r\nRoberts was employed at the McNair Law Firm as a paralegal.Â  On October 1, 1998, she tripped over a box of files and suffered a herniated disk.Â  After an initial period of treatment, she was admitted to the hospital where a surgeon performed a laminectomy and fusion procedure.Â  She returned to work part-time on May 31, 2000, and was paid temporary partial disability compensation.Â  After her injury, Roberts received three merit raises.Â  Due to her injury, Roberts stopped working on June 19, 2001.Â  \r\nRoberts filed for total permanent workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  After a hearing on May 14, 2002, the single commissioner found Roberts totally and permanently disabled.Â  In an order dated March 10, 2003, the single commissioner made the following pertinent findings:Â  (1) McNair paid all the temporary disability compensation for which they were liable; (2) Roberts sustained a greater than 50% permanent loss of the use of her back as a result of the injury; (3) there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant departure from the method of average weekly wage calculations under section 42-1-40 of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act; and (4) Roberts was entitled to 500 weeks of compensation less the number of weeks of temporary disability compensation already received.Â  \r\nRoberts appealed to the full commission arguing entitlement to a compensation rate that included the merit raises she received during her part-time employment.Â  Additionally, Roberts alleged the single commissioner erred by counting â€œhalf weeks,â€ when she worked part-time, as full weeks against the statutory 500-week recovery period.Â  \r\nThe full commission adopted the commissionerâ€™s order and affirmed.Â  The circuit court likewise affirmed. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the commission, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  The appellate court may reverse or modify the full commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;\r\nCalculation of compensation rate\r\n    Roberts contends the commission erred by failing to include her post-injury merit increases in calculating her compensation rate.Â  We disagree.\r\n    Section 42-1-40 states:\r\n\r\n    â€˜Average weekly wagesâ€™ means the earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury . . . .Â  â€˜Average weekly wageâ€™ must be calculated by taking the total wages paid for the last four quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the injury occurred . . . divided by fifty-two or by the actual number of weeks for which wages were paid, whichever is less.\r\n\r\n    . . .\r\n\r\n    When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.\r\n\r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n    At the time of Robertsâ€™ injury, she earned $533.95 a week.Â  Roberts returned to work on a part-time basis until June 19, 2001, when she was unable to continue working.Â  After her injury, Roberts received three merit increases, raising her weekly salary to an alleged $594.27, an increase of $60.32 a week.Â  \r\n    The question before this court is whether the raises Roberts received constituted extraordinary circumstances entitling her to a compensation rate based on her new salary.Â  The single commissioner found that â€œsalary increases subsequent to an injury by accident do not provide exceptional reasons to justify departure from the method of average weekly wage calculation prescribed under section 42-1-40 as such an argument could be made in almost every workerâ€™s compensation case.â€Â  Roberts argues the commissioner erred, relying on Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Center, 350 S.C. 183, 564 S.E.2d 694 (Ct. App. 2002), in support of her argument.Â  We find Sellers distinguishable.Â  \r\n    In Sellers, the claimant was a sixteen-year-old high school student working part-time when he sustained a spinal cord injury that rendered him a paraplegic.Â  Sellers, 350 S.C. at 185, 564 S.E.2d at 696.Â  His compensation rate from his part-time employment was less than $100.Â  Id.Â  The commission considered the extent of the injury and the claimantâ€™s age constituted exceptional circumstances requiring a departure from the method of average weekly wage calculation set forth in section 42-1-40.Â  The commission therefore considered the claimantâ€™s probable future earning capacity in determining the claimantâ€™s compensation award.Â  In affirming the commission, this court stated:Â  â€œAs the commission found â€˜[b]ut for the severe injury, [Sellers] clearly demonstrated the interest, aptitude, and ability to become an electrician.â€™ . . . [Sellers] stated his goal was to become a master electrician.â€Â  Sellers, 350 S.C. at 191-92, 564 S.E.2d at 699.Â  \r\n    In this case, Roberts was fully employed and earned a full-time salary at the time of her accident.Â  The extraordinary circumstances present in Sellers are not present in this case.\r\n    We likewise conclude the extraordinary circumstances found in Elliott&nbsp;v. South Carolina Department of Transportation, 362 S.C. 234, 607 S.E.2d 90 (Ct. App. 2004), do not apply here.Â  In Elliott, the claimant received a pre-injury salary increase.Â  Elliott, 362 S.C. at 236, 607 S.E.2d at 91.Â  Robertsâ€™ merit increases were post-injury.Â  Mindful of our standard of review, we find evidence to support the commissionâ€™s finding that Robertsâ€™ post-injury increases do not justify deviating from the statutory method of average weekly wage calculation.Â  \r\n    B.Â  Calculation of the number of weeks awarded\r\n    Roberts argues the weeks she worked part-time and received temporary partial compensation should not be counted as full weeks in determining the number of weeks paid in her permanent award.Â  We disagree.\r\n    Roberts was paid temporary partial disability as compensation for her reduced earnings during the weeks she returned to work after her initial recovery from surgery in accordance with section 42-9-20 of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  \r\n    Section 42-9-20 states:\r\n\r\n    [W[hen the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as provided in this chapter, to the injured employee during such disability a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than the average weekly wage in this State for the preceding fiscal year.Â  \r\n\r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985).\r\n    Roberts argues she should be paid total compensation for the entire 500 weeks allocated for permanent recovery, disregarding the weeks she was compensated for partial disability.Â  We disagree.Â  Section 42-9-10 of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act provides that, except under circumstances not applicable in this case, the period for compensation may not exceed 500 weeks.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 2004).\r\n    Roberts attempts to characterize the weeks she received partial disability compensation as â€œhalf weeks.â€Â  We find she was not paid â€œhalf weeksâ€ as she alleges but was paid temporary partial disability benefits pursuant to section 42-9-20 to compensate for her reduced earnings during the period she worked part-time.Â  We accordingly hold the commission did not err in finding Roberts entitled to the sum of 500 weeks of compensation less the number of weeks she received temporary partial compensation.Â  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    For the reasons set forth herein, the decision of the circuit court affirming the full commission is\r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4000","title":"Alexander v.

Bumgarter for an independent medical\r\nexamination.&nbsp; Dr. Bumgarter agreed that Alexander suffered a stroke caused\r\nby an arterial tear.&nbsp; He concluded that it was quite plausible the tear was\r\ncaused by Alexanderâ€™s work activity on March 8.\r\nAlexander filed a workersâ€™\r\ncompensation claim with the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\nCommission.&nbsp; The matter was first heard by the single commissioner, who\r\nfound the arterial tear and resulting stroke were compensable under Shealy v.\r\nAiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000), and South Carolina Code\r\nsection 42-1-160 (1976).&nbsp; The ruling was then appealed to the Full Workersâ€™\r\nCompensation Commission.&nbsp; The Full Commission found that Alexanderâ€™s\r\narterial dissection was, in fact, â€œan injury by accident arising out of and in\r\nthe course and scope of the claimantâ€™s employmentâ€ and therefore\r\ncompensable, but reversed the single commissioner on one important point.&nbsp;\r\nThe Full Commission concluded that Alexanderâ€™s stroke, although a direct\r\nresult of the arterial tear, â€œwas not caused by unusual or extraordinary\r\nconditions of employment or sudden and unexpected exertion or strain.â€&nbsp;\r\nThis conclusion was supported, in the commissionâ€™s view, by evidence that\r\nAlexander was familiar with the process of changing a forklift starter, knew\r\nthat this forklift model had a particularly heavy starter, and commonly lifted\r\nitems weighing between fifty and eighty pounds in the course of his\r\nemployment.&nbsp; The Full Commission determined, therefore, that the stroke,\r\nviewed as a separate injury from the arterial tear, was not a compensable\r\ninjury.\r\nBoth Alexander and his employer\r\nappealed the Full Commissionâ€™s decision to the circuit court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The\r\ncircuit court determined there was substantial evidence to support the\r\ncommissionâ€™s finding that Alexanderâ€™s stroke was not the result of\r\nunexpected strain or overexertion in the performance of his duties or unusual\r\nand extraordinary conditions of employment.&nbsp; The court concluded, however,\r\nthat because the stroke, according to the findings of the commission and the\r\nundisputed medical evidence in the record, was the direct result of an â€œaccidentâ€\r\nas contemplated by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, it was a compensable\r\ninjury.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act\r\nestablishes our standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™\r\nCompensation Commission as the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard.&nbsp; See\r\nLark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).&nbsp;\r\nPursuant to this standard, the factual findings of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\nCommission are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by\r\nsubstantial evidence. Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n,\r\n318 S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995).&nbsp; â€œSubstantial evidence is\r\nnot a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such\r\nevidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds\r\nto reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€&nbsp; Shealy, 341\r\nS.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.&nbsp; Accordingly, â€œ[w]e can reverse or modify\r\nthe Full Commissionâ€™s decision in this case only if [Appellantsâ€™]\r\nsubstantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an\r\nerror of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\nsubstantial evidence on the whole record.â€&nbsp; Id. at 454-55, 535\r\nS.E.2d at 442 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d), (e) (Supp. 1997)).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court\r\nerred in reversing the Full Commission on the compensability of Alexanderâ€™s\r\nstroke because the stroke was not brought on by sudden or unexpected strain or\r\nunusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.&nbsp; On the same grounds,\r\nthey argue the court erred in affirming the Full Commissionâ€™s ruling that\r\nAlexanderâ€™s arterial tear was compensable.&nbsp; We reluctantly agree.\r\nAs an initial matter, we discuss the\r\nprudence of the Full Commissionâ€™s factual determinations.&nbsp; The Full\r\nCommission perspicuously concluded that Alexanderâ€™s employment conditions at\r\nthe time of the stroke were not unusual or extraordinary and, at the time of the\r\ninjury, his physical strain was neither sudden nor unexpected.&nbsp; The circuit\r\ncourt affirmed this factual determination as supported by substantial evidence\r\nin the record.&nbsp; Pursuant to our standard of review, we likewise affirm this\r\nfinding.&nbsp; The Full Commission outlined the evidence it relied upon in\r\nreaching this conclusion, citing both Alexanderâ€™s testimony and that of his\r\nco-worker that he had replaced starters before, was familiar with the weight of\r\nthis particular starter, and would routinely perform this kind of physical\r\nexertion in the course of a normal working day.&nbsp; While it may be possible\r\nto draw differing conclusions from the evidence in this case, the view of the\r\nFull Commission was certainly reachable by reasonable minds and supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence; thus, it must be affirmed.&nbsp; See Oâ€™Banner\r\nv. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 30, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327-28 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1995) (â€œThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the\r\nevidence does not prevent the commissionâ€™s findings from being supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence.â€); Fair v. Fluor Daniel, 309 S.C. 520, 521, 424\r\nS.E.2d 541, 542 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œWhen evidence is in conflict, someone has to\r\ndetermine the true facts.&nbsp; That chore is assigned to the Workerâ€™s\r\nCompensation Commission.â€).\r\nThe affirmation of this finding\r\nleaves this court with the following legal query:&nbsp; under South Carolina\r\nlaw, may a stroke, heart attack, or vascular injury be found compensable in\r\ncertain circumstances when it is not induced by sudden and unexpected strain or\r\nextraordinary conditions of employment?&nbsp; After a thorough review of South\r\nCarolina case law applying the special â€œheart attack standardâ€ for\r\ncompensability, we must answer this question in the negative.\r\nSimply put, a heart attack\r\nconstitutes a compensable accident within the meaning of the Workersâ€™\r\nCompensation Act if it is induced by unexpected strain or over-exertion\r\nin the performance of employment, or by unusual and extraordinary employment\r\nconditions.&nbsp; Bridges v. Housing Auth., City of Charleston, 278 S.C.\r\n342, 344, 295 S.E.2d 872, 873-74 (1982).&nbsp; This special standard for\r\ndetermining compensability also applies to cerebral hemorrhages, apoplexy, or\r\nother injuries to the blood vessels.&nbsp; Kearse v. South Carolina Wildlife\r\nRes. Depâ€™t, 236 S.C. 540, 546, 115 S.E.2d 183, 186-187 (1960); Jennings\r\nv. Chambers Dev. Company, 335 S.C. 249, 255, 516 S.E.2d 453, 456 (Ct. App.\r\n1999).&nbsp; Because we find no authority clearly expressing an exception to\r\nthis general rule, we must reverse the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Alexanderâ€™s\r\nstroke is compensable.&nbsp; Similarly, because the rule is applicable to\r\nvascular injuries as well as strokes and heart attacks, we reverse the Full\r\nCommissionâ€™s ruling that Alexanderâ€™s underlying arterial dissection, viewed\r\nseparately from the stroke, was a compensable injury.&nbsp; See id.\r\nThe circuit court based its finding\r\nof compensability on the fact that Alexander suffered a definite traumatic\r\ninjury in the course of his employment.&nbsp; In short, the court found that\r\nsince the medical evidence so clearly reflected a specific injury, which\r\noccurred as a result of his job and unmistakably caused his stroke, application\r\nof the heart attack standard would be imprudent.&nbsp;\r\nThe rationale of the circuit court\r\nis notably persuasive.&nbsp; The heart attack standard was established on the\r\nsound presumption that illness, injury, or death resulting from certain vascular\r\ncalamities is â€œordinarily the result of natural physiological causes rather\r\nthan trauma or particular effort.â€&nbsp; Price v. B.F. Shaw Co., 224\r\nS.C. 89, 97, 77 S.E.2d 491, 494 (1953).&nbsp; Accordingly, it would be patently\r\nunfair to hold an employer liable for such injuries through our workersâ€™\r\ncompensation system based solely on the fact that the employee was at work when\r\nthe stroke or heart attack occurred.&nbsp; However, when medical causation is so\r\nclearly established as a specific traumatic work-related injury, the purposes\r\nunderlying the application of the heart attack standard are largely\r\nabsent.&nbsp; The denial of compensation in these rare cases seems to us rather\r\nsevere, perhaps leading to outcomes not anticipated by the proponents of the\r\nstandard.&nbsp; This rationale is vaguely referenced in some early case law on\r\nthe subject.&nbsp; See, e.g., id. at 98, 77 S.E.2d at 495 (â€œIn\r\nevery case decided by this Court, involving benefits under the [Workersâ€™]\r\nCompensation Act resulting from heart conditions or other physiological bodily\r\nconditions in which award of benefits were adjudged, there was some unusual or\r\nextraordinary condition attached to the work environment, or unusual exertion\r\nand strain in the performance of the work, or of course, a definite traumatic\r\ninjury. . . .)(emphasis added).&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, the requirement that a\r\nclaimant show he was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions of\r\nemployment or unexpected strain or overexertion to receive benefits for a heart\r\nattack, stroke, or vascular injury has been reiterated by our supreme court as\r\nrecently as 2000.&nbsp; See Shealy, 341 S.C. at 457, 535 S.E.2d at\r\n443.&nbsp; Because South Carolina law does not currently clearly recognize an\r\nexception to the general heart attack standard when there is a definite\r\ntraumatic injury arising in the course of oneâ€™s employment and because our\r\npowers, as an intermediate appellate court, do not permit us to create one,[1] we reluctantly conclude the circuit\r\ncourt and Full Commission erred in finding any of Alexanderâ€™s injuries\r\ncompensable.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the\r\ncircuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] See Lusk v.

Concrete), appeals the grant of summary judgment to\r\nHightower Construction Company, Inc. (Hightower Construction), arguing the\r\ncircuit court erred in finding the case presented no factual issue for\r\ndetermination by a jury.&nbsp; A.J. Concrete also contends the circuit court\r\nerred in its alternative conclusion that the indemnification clause at issue was\r\nvoid as against public policy.&nbsp; We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHightower Construction was hired to\r\nerect a building foundation in Georgetown, South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; A portion of the construction project required the pouring of\r\nconcrete into a large mold.&nbsp; To complete this task, Daniel Premo, the job\r\nsuperintendent and foreman, entered into an oral contract with A.J. Concrete on\r\nbehalf of Hightower Construction for the lease of a concrete truck and boom pump\r\noperator to pump concrete into the foundation mold.&nbsp; Although this was the\r\nfirst time Hightower Construction contracted with A.J. Concrete, it previously\r\nleased a concrete pump truck from A.J. Concrete II, A.J. Concreteâ€™s sister\r\ncompany.&nbsp; Premo, while employed elsewhere, contracted with A.J. Concrete\r\nunder similar circumstances on as many as thirty prior occasions.\r\nOn December 17, 1998, A.J. Concreteâ€™s\r\ntruck and boom operator, Eddy Helman, arrived at the site.&nbsp; According to\r\nHelman, he and Premo discussed the presence of overhead electrical power lines\r\nbefore the pour began.&nbsp; Helman believed the safest way to conduct the job\r\nwas to situate the boom pump in the closest safe position to the power lines and\r\nproceed with the pour by gradually moving away from the lines.&nbsp; After\r\nHelman situated the boom pump accordingly and poured about a yard of concrete,\r\nPremo motioned angrily at him to move the boom into the position farthest from\r\nthe lines.&nbsp; This required that Helman move the boom pump closer and closer\r\nto the power lines during the course of the pour.&nbsp; Helman stated at his\r\ndeposition that, although troubled by the change, he did not vocally object\r\nbecause Premo had previously stated that he and his workers would â€œkeep an eye\r\non the lines.â€&nbsp; He also stated that he understood his duty to be to â€œperform\r\nthe concrete pump job to the requirements of my customer.â€\r\nPremo initially stood inside the\r\nmold and guided the nozzle of the concrete pump while Helman guided the\r\nsupporting boom with a radio control device.&nbsp; Premo later left to see to\r\nother business, assigning his task to Heyward Keith, another employee of\r\nHightower Construction.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Keith directed Helman to move\r\nthe boom.&nbsp; The boom came in contact with the nearby power lines, resulting\r\nin Keith being seriously injured from an electrical shock.\r\nAfter Keith received the requisite\r\nmedical attention, Helman and other Hightower Construction employees completed\r\nthe job.&nbsp; Helman then presented Premo with a â€œjob ticket,â€ which listed\r\nthe work performed, the applicable rate, and the amount owed for the job.&nbsp;\r\nThe back of the ticket contained various contractual terms including terms of\r\npayment, limitation of warranties, and the following clause:\r\n\r\n  INDEMNIFICATION AND RISK OF\r\n  LOSS:&nbsp; Lessor and Lessee agree that the leased equipment and all persons\r\n  operating such equipment, including Lessorâ€™s employees, will be under Lesseeâ€™s\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction, supervision, and control during the time such\r\n  equipment and operators are on Lesseeâ€™s job site, the Lessee agrees to\r\n  indemnify Lessor against all claims, actions, proceedings, costs, damages, and\r\n  liabilities arising in any manner out of, connected with, or resulting from\r\n  the operation or handling of the leased equipment on Lesseeâ€™s job site,\r\n  including without limitation, any injury, disability or death of workmen or\r\n  other persons and any loss or damage to property, whether the liability, loss\r\n  or damage is caused by or arises out of the negligence of Lessorâ€™s employees\r\n  or otherwise.\r\n\r\nNothing on the front of the job\r\nticket directs the reader to the back of the ticket.&nbsp; Premo signed the job\r\nticket and later presented a copy to Hightower Constructionâ€™s office\r\nstaff.&nbsp; Hightower Construction paid the full amount A.J. Concrete charged\r\nfor the job.\r\nAfter successfully pursuing a\r\nworkersâ€™ compensation claim against Hightower Construction, Keith commenced a\r\ncivil lawsuit against several defendants, including A.J. Concrete, alleging that\r\ntheir negligence caused his injuries.&nbsp; A.J. Concrete filed a third-party\r\ncomplaint against Hightower Construction, asserting contractual indemnity as\r\nreflected by the terms listed on the back of the job ticket.&nbsp; Both parties\r\nto the third-party claim filed motions for summary judgment.&nbsp; Following a\r\nhearing on the motions, the circuit court granted Hightower Constructionâ€™s\r\nmotion, concluding that, as a matter of law, the indemnification clause was not\r\npart of the contract and, alternatively, was unenforceable because it was overly\r\nbroad and violated public policy.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment\r\nis to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a\r\nfact finder.â€&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868,\r\n874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this\r\ncourt applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860\r\n(2002).&nbsp;\r\nIn determining whether a triable\r\nissue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must\r\nbe viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v.\r\nPub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; Even\r\nif there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions\r\nor inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.&nbsp; Baugus\r\nv. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991).&nbsp; Summary\r\njudgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\ndesirable to clarify the application of law.&nbsp; Tupper v. Dorchester County,\r\n326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. The Indemnification Clause as\r\nPart of the Contract\r\nThe circuit court found, as a matter\r\nof law, that the indemnification clause was not part of the contract because 1)\r\nthe undisputed facts fail to reflect a meeting of the minds between the parties\r\nand 2) the terms on the back of the job ticket are unenforceable due to lack of\r\nconsideration.&nbsp; We address each finding in turn.\r\nMeeting of the Minds\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s approval of\r\nHightower Constructionâ€™s motion for summary judgment was based largely on its\r\nfinding that A.J. Concrete presented no evidence that the presence of the\r\nindemnification clause was â€œmade known or . . . from all the circumstances,\r\nshould [have been] knownâ€ by the parties to the contract.&nbsp; Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891,\r\n894 (1989).&nbsp; We disagree and find that A.J. Concrete presented a question\r\nof fact for determination by a jury.\r\nThis case concerns an oral contract\r\nto provide concrete pumping services.&nbsp; Although the disputed term of the\r\ncontract was presented on the back of a job ticket and signed by Hightower\r\nConstruction after completion of the pour, A.J. Concrete argues that the\r\nlesseeâ€™s supervisory control and accompanying lessor indemnification are so\r\ncommon in the trade that they were understood by the parties upon entry into the\r\ncontractual relationship.\r\nThe main concern of the court, when\r\ninterpreting an oral contract, is to give effect to the intention of the\r\nparties.&nbsp; Columbia East Assoc.\r\nv. Bi-Lo, Inc., 299 S.C. 515, 519, 386 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1989).&nbsp; â€œThe\r\ncourts, in attempting to ascertain this intention, will endeavor to determine\r\nthe situation of the parties, as well as their purposes, at the time the\r\ncontract was entered.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nWhen a contract is silent as to a particular matter, parol evidence is\r\nadmissible to reveal the partiesâ€™ true intent.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nTo this end, â€œit is necessary for enforceability that the essentials of the\r\ncontract be agreed upon but all need not be expressed.&nbsp; They may be\r\nimplied from custom and usual forms [trade usage] and former course of dealing.â€\r\nCarolina Aviation, Inc. v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., 214 S.C. 222, 230, 51\r\nS.E.2d 757, 761 (1949) (emphasis added).&nbsp; While the use of uniform trade\r\npractices to reflect contractual intention has been statutorily codified in the\r\nU.C.C. and further refined as it applies to the sale of goods, a review of South\r\nCarolina case law reveals that the contractual efficacy of trade custom and\r\nusage is also applicable to other types of contracts.&nbsp; See id.\r\nat 230-31, 51 S.E.2d at 761; Burden v. Woodside Cotton Mills, 104 S.C.\r\n435, 439, 89 S.E. 474, 475 (1916).\r\nâ€œTrade usageâ€ has been generally\r\ndefined as â€œa uniform course of conduct in some particular business or callingâ€\r\nor â€œa practice or method observed with regularity with respect to the\r\ntransaction being performedâ€ that is â€œso well established, general, and\r\nuniform that [the parties] must be presumed to have acted with reference\r\nthereto.â€&nbsp; 21A Am. Jur. 2d Customs and Usages Â§ 1 (1998).&nbsp;\r\nâ€œA usage or custom to be recognized by law must be long standing, general in\r\nits operation, known to, and acquiesced in, by all whose rights are affected by\r\nit, and be just and reasonable in its operation.â€&nbsp; Love v. Gamble,\r\n316 S.C. 203, 209-10, 448 S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1994).&nbsp; If evidence is\r\npresented to support a specific trade usage that may resolve an ambiguity or\r\nmatter on which the contract is silent, â€œ[w]hether the existence of a\r\nparticular custom or usage has been satisfactorily shown by the evidence is\r\nordinarily a question of fact, which . . . is to be determined, like other\r\nfactual questions, by the jury.â€&nbsp; 21A Am. Jur. 2d Customs and Usages\r\nÂ§ 53 (1998).&nbsp; â€œThe jury determines under all the circumstances of the\r\ncase the weight to be given to evidence of a custom or usage of business.â€&nbsp;\r\nId.; see also Gold Kist, Inc. v. Citizens and S. Natâ€™l\r\nBank of South Carolina, 286 S.C. 272, 279, 333 S.E.2d 67, 71 (Ct. App. 1985)\r\n(finding, under a different factual and procedural scenario, that â€œthe\r\nquestion of whether [a disputed term] was a part of the agreement between the\r\nparties was a jury question.â€); RentCo., a Div. of Fruehauf Corp. v. Tamway\r\nCorp., 283 S.C. 265, 268, 321 S.E.2d 199, 201 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding an\r\nissue relating to the intent of the parties, when the contract was silent to a\r\ncertain term, was one that should have been presented to the jury).\r\nIn the present case, A.J. Concrete\r\npresented the affidavit of Jim Duffy, the manager of A.J. Concrete, as evidence\r\nthat indemnification, as reflected by the job ticket, was A.J. Concreteâ€™s â€œhabit\r\nand custom, as well as the general standard in the industry.â€&nbsp; A.J.\r\nConcrete also offered the affidavit of Jeff Moll, the president of several\r\nconcrete companies, a member of the American Concrete Pumping Association, and a\r\npast member of its board of directors, who stated that he was â€œfamiliar with\r\nthe industry standards and customs in the construction industryâ€ and\r\nindemnification was â€œtypical in the industry.â€[1]&nbsp; Furthermore, it can certainly be inferred\r\nfrom the conduct of the partiesâ€™ employees, when viewing the evidence in a\r\nlight most favorable to A.J. Concrete, that all involved were at least cognizant\r\nof the customs regarding Hightower Constructionâ€™s supervisory control of the\r\nboom pump truck and its operator, notwithstanding the fact that the job ticket\r\ncontaining the written terms had yet to be presented or signed.\r\nConsidering the above evidence, we\r\nconclude the circuit erred in granting Hightower Constructionâ€™s motion for\r\nsummary judgment.&nbsp; However slight it may appear in the eyes of the court,\r\nA.J. Concrete supported its position that the parties understood the conditions\r\nof indemnification at the time the contract was entered into with competent\r\nevidence; hence, a jury issue arose as to a material fact of the case and\r\nsummary judgment was not proper.\r\nLack of Consideration\r\nThe circuit court also concluded\r\nthat the disputed indemnification clause was not part of the contract due to the\r\nfact that the job ticket was signed after the performance of A.J. Concreteâ€™s\r\ncontractual duties; thus, there was no consideration for its terms.&nbsp; In\r\nlight of our previous discussion, this conclusion was also made in error.&nbsp;\r\nThere is no doubt that adequate consideration existed to form a contract at the\r\ntime the contract was entered.&nbsp; A.J. Concrete does not contend that\r\nindemnification was an additional term added to the contract after performance,\r\nbut that the parties understood the indemnification term when the contract was\r\nentered into due to commonly accepted trade practices.&nbsp; Accordingly, the\r\ncircuit courtâ€™s finding that the term fails as a matter of law due to lack of\r\nconsideration was erroneous.\r\nII. Public Policy\r\nAs an alternative basis for granting\r\nHightower Constructionâ€™s motion for summary judgment, the circuit court found\r\nthat the disputed indemnification clause was overly broad and thus void as\r\nagainst public policy.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court based its finding\r\non this courtâ€™s recent decision in Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 584\r\nS.E.2d 149 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp; In Fisher, we held that an exculpatory\r\nclause, once determined overly broad, was void as against public policy.&nbsp;\r\nThe exculpatory clause at issue in Fisher relieved â€œany persons in any\r\nrestricted areaâ€ from all liability.&nbsp; Id. at 296, 584 S.E.2d at\r\n152.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the clause relieved all potential defendants from any\r\nand all liability, no matter the circumstances giving rise to the injury, we\r\nconcluded the clause was overly broad as a matter of law.&nbsp; Id. at\r\n297, 584 S.E.2d at 153 (citing a Wisconsin Supreme Court case interpreting a\r\nexculpatory clause which likewise barred an injured party from any legal\r\nrecourse for damages arising from his injuries).\r\nIn the present case, the clause at\r\nissue merely calls for the indemnification of a potential defendant by another\r\npotential defendant for liability arising from a plaintiffâ€™s injuries.&nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, the contractual indemnification is limited to those injuries\r\narising from the use and operation of the leased equipment while it is under the\r\nlesseeâ€™s â€œexclusive jurisdiction, supervision, and control.â€&nbsp;\r\nRecognizing the freedom of sophisticated parties to contract as they choose, we\r\nconclude the clause, though wide in scope, is not so overly broad as to render\r\nthe clause void as against public policy.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we conclude that A.J.\r\nConcrete presented a limited question of fact for determination by a jury and\r\nthat the indemnification clause at issue is not void as against public policy,\r\nthe decision of the circuit court is hereby\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] Mollâ€™s deposition distinguishes this case from the facts of Love,\r\n316 S.C. at 209-210, 448 S.E.2d at 880, in which the circuit courtâ€™s grant of\r\nsummary judgment was affirmed because no evidence of trade custom or usage was\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4002","title":"State v.

Wilson, 345\r\nS.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).&nbsp; A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the\r\nadmissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the\r\ndefendant.&nbsp; State v.

Acts Â§ 7 and amended most recently in August 2003, provides a\r\nperson suspected of driving under the influence with the right to refuse â€œchemical\r\ntests of his breath, blood, or urine for the purpose of determining the presence\r\nof alcohol or drugs.â€&nbsp; Also, the arresting officer must first offer a\r\nbreath test in writing before administering any other tests.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Additionally, Section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(b) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) provides that a person who violates section\r\n56-5-2945[1] must have his conduct at\r\nthe breath test site videotaped, including being informed of the right to refuse\r\nthe test.\r\nIn June 1998, in conjunction with\r\nAct 434, the legislature enacted section 56-5-2946 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2004), which states the following in regard to felony DUI:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other\r\n  provision of law, a person must submit to either one or a combination\r\n  of chemical tests of his breath, blood, or urine for the purpose of\r\n  determining the presence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and\r\n  drugs if there is probable cause to believe that the person violated or is\r\n  under arrest for violation of Section 56-5-2945.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe trial court found a conflict\r\nbetween sections 56-5-2953 and 29-5-2946.&nbsp; The trial court concluded\r\nsection 56-5-2953 specifically states a suspect must be advised of his right to\r\nrefuse the breath test, and section 56-5-2953 should not be read to give a\r\nsuspect a right, while 56-5-2946 takes that right away.&nbsp; Finally, the court\r\nreasoned section 56-5-2946 could be reconciled with 56-5-2953 by concluding that\r\nif Cuevas refused the breath test, the arresting officer could have required him\r\nto submit to one of the other tests.\r\nAt oral argument, Cuevas conceded\r\nthat the arresting officer, not the suspect, has the right to select the test to\r\nbe administered to the suspect.&nbsp; Section 56-5-2946 clearly states, â€œa\r\nperson must submit to either one or a combination of chemical tests of his\r\nbreath, blood, or urine. . . .â€ We therefore conclude pursuant to the plain\r\nlanguage of section 56-5-2946, an arresting officer may require a suspect to\r\nsubmit to all three tests without affording the suspect the right to refuse any\r\nof them.\r\nIn State v. Long, Op. No.\r\n25955 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Mar. 21,\r\n2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 68), our Supreme Court held although the â€œtechnical\r\ntesting requirementsâ€ of section 56-5-2950 are incorporated into section\r\n56-5-2946, section 56-5-2946 â€œessentially alter[ed] the procedural\r\nprerequisites which must be met under section 56-5-2950. . . .â€&nbsp; The\r\ncourt concluded 56-5-2950 afforded Long no legal right to refuse a breath test\r\nbefore requiring him to submit to a blood test.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Moreover, according to Long, â€œthe officer\r\nneed no longer offer a breath test as the first optionâ€ for persons who are\r\nunder arrest for violation of felony DUI.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; at 71.&nbsp; Likewise, we hold section 56-5-2953â€™s\r\ntechnical procedural videotaping requirements are incorporated into 56-5-2946,\r\nbut 56-5-2953 does not afford a suspect the right to refuse a breath test,\r\ninasmuch as such right is not afforded under section 56-5-2946.\r\nBecause the legislature is presumed\r\nto intend its statutes accomplish something, the trial court erred in reasoning\r\nthe right of refusal remains applicable in felony DUI cases despite the\r\nenactment of section 56-5-2946.&nbsp; See Long, Op. No. 25955 at\r\n68 (citing, South Carolina Coastal\r\nConserv. League v. South Carolina Depâ€™t\r\nof Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 354 S.C. 585, 589, 582 S.E.2d 410, 413\r\n(2003)).&nbsp; Therefore, the trial court erred in suppressing the results of\r\nCuevasâ€™s breath test.\r\nII.&nbsp;\r\nCuevas also argues this court should\r\nuphold the trial courtâ€™s suppression of the breath test results because\r\nprobable cause to arrest him for felony DUI did not exist.&nbsp; Specifically,\r\nCuevas argues there was insufficient evidence that he was under the influence of\r\nalcohol at the time of his arrest.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe dispostive question in\r\ndetermining whether a warrantless arrest is lawful is whether there was probable\r\ncause to make the arrest.&nbsp; Wortman v. City of Spartanburg, 310 S.C. 1, 4, 425 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1992).&nbsp;\r\nProbable cause to arrest without a warrant generally exists when facts and\r\ncircumstances within an arresting officerâ€™s knowledge are sufficient for a\r\nreasonable person to believe that a crime has been or is being committed by the\r\nperson to be arrested.&nbsp; State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 552, 451\r\nS.E. 2d 34, 37 (Ct. App. 1994).&nbsp; In determining whether probable cause\r\nexists, â€œall the evidence within the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge may be\r\nconsidered, including the details observed while responding to information\r\nreceived.â€&nbsp; State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 17, 260 S.E.2d 705, 706\r\n(1979).&nbsp; In other words, â€œ[a] police officer has probable cause to arrest\r\nwithout a warrant where he in good faith believes that a person is guilty of a\r\nfelony, and his belief rests on such grounds as would induce an ordinary prudent\r\nand cautious man, under the circumstances to believe likewise. . . .â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nWe hold the evidence within the\r\narresting officerâ€™s knowledge was sufficient to arrest Cuevas.&nbsp; The\r\nevidence included the facts that Cuevas left the scene of the accident, he had a\r\nstrong smell of alcohol on his breath, he had an open beer container in his\r\nvehicle, and he had a bruise on his chest, apparently resulting from the\r\ninflation of the air bag in his vehicle.&nbsp; Finally, Cuevas conceded at oral\r\nargument that the accident resulted in great bodily injury to another person.\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s decision is hereby\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] Section 56-5-2945 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) provides\r\nthat any person while under the influence of alcohol or drugs that drives a\r\nvehicle and engages in any act forbidden by law and the act results in great\r\nbodily injury or death to another person is guilty of a felony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4003","title":"State v.

Boyd, 288 S.C. 206, 341 S.E.2d 144 (Ct. App.\r\n1986), we explained that a court is restricted from using a prior conviction for\r\nenhancement if the prior offense arose â€œout of simultaneous acts committed in\r\nthe course of a single incident.â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 209-10, 341 S.E.2d at 146.&nbsp; In Boyd, the defendant was convicted\r\nof a drug charge and sentenced as a third time offender.&nbsp; Id. at 207, 341 S.E.2d at 145.&nbsp; His sentence was enhanced\r\nbased on earlier convictions for possession of marijuana, hashish, and\r\nprescription pills.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the earlier convictions arose from the same arrest.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The court found Boyd should have been sentenced as a\r\nsecond time offender because multiple convictions will be considered as one for\r\nsentencing purposes if they â€œaris[e] out of simultaneous acts committed in the\r\ncourse of a single incident.â€&nbsp; Id. at 209-10, 341 S.E.2d at 146.&nbsp; See also\r\nState v.

App. 2001) (finding\r\narmed robberies of a convenience store and the convenience store clerk were\r\ncommitted within one incident and should only be treated as one conviction for\r\nsentencing purposes).\r\nMunyon argues the 2002 and 2003\r\nconvictions should be treated as one for sentencing purposes because they took\r\nplace in the same general location (Charleston), involved the same people, took\r\nplace during overlapping time frames, and involved similar crimes (dealing\r\nmarijuana).&nbsp; However, Munyonâ€™s prior charge was based on possession with\r\nintent to distribute on June 17, 2001.&nbsp; By Munyonâ€™s own admission, he did\r\nnot enter the conspiracy that began in 1999 until 2002.&nbsp; Therefore, the\r\ncharges did not arise out of simultaneous acts committed in the course of a\r\nsingle incident.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4004","title":"Historic Charleston Holdings v.

Summerall, IV, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J:Â  Gerard Mallon appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order awarding Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC, one-half of the proceeds from the sale of a piece of property owned by Dixie Holdings, LLC, of which both Mallon and Historic Charleston Holdings were members.Â  Additionally, Mallon appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s refusal to conduct an accounting, as well as the award of prejudgment interest, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs to Historic Charleston Holdings.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn June of 1998, Gerard Mallon formed Dixie Holdings, LLC, a member-managed, term limited liability company.Â  Mallon, William Storen,[1] and Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC (HCH) executed an operating agreement as the three members of Dixie Holdings.Â  Priestly Coker and Cynthia Coker were the sole members of HCH.[2]Â  Subsequently, HCH and Mallon also became members in Dixie Developers, LLC.Â  However, HCH ultimately sold its interest to Mallon, leaving Mallon as the sole member of Dixie Developers.Â  \r\nThe members formed Dixie Holdings for the purpose of purchasing, renovating, and selling various real properties.Â  Although Dixie Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement did not specify each memberâ€™s duties, the record indicates Priestly Coker (Coker) performed accounting and financial related services,[3] Mallon, through his construction company, renovated the properties, and Storen acted as the real estate agent in locating potential investment properties and later marketing them.Â Â  \r\nShortly after the execution of the operating agreement, Mallon, Storen, and Coker on behalf of HCH, amended the operating agreement to reflect the membersâ€™ interest in Dixie Holdings.Â  This amendment stated Mallon and HCH each owned a 49.5% interest and Storen owned a 1% interest.Â Â  \r\nDixie Holdings purchased four properties located in Charleston, South Carolina.Â  According to Mallon, a dispute arose between Mallon and Coker after Dixie Holdings sold two of those properties because Coker failed to provide financial information related to Dixie Holdings and Dixie Developers.Â  Although Mallon had been given money from the proceeds of those sales, he believed he had not separately been compensated for work performed in renovating those properties.Â  \r\nIn December 1999, the parties executed a written agreement in connection with a membersâ€™ meeting that took place several days prior.Â  The agreement provided for an audit of Dixie Holdings and stated if the members could not resolve their differences, then an arbitrator would be appointed by agreement of the parties.Â  In addition, the agreement stated, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nThe primary function of the formation of these companies is purchase and sale of Real Estate.\r\nSales are to be made while these matters are being dealt with.\r\nThe sales proceeds can be held in an escrow account.Â  OR [othen [sic] written accepted offer]. \r\n\r\nCoker gave Mallon a box containing some of the companyâ€™s financial records in April 2000.Â  \r\nAfter the execution of this agreement, Dixie Holdings sold the third property, referred to by the parties as â€œ15 Felix Street,â€ on April 14, 2000.Â  Coker testified that, pursuant to the partiesâ€™ December 1999 agreement, he believed the net proceeds from the sale were to be placed in an escrow account until the parties determined what expenses needed to be paid and Mallon had been compensated for any related expenses.Â  The net proceeds of $41,845.30 were given to Mallon, who placed them in a bank account in the name of Dixie Developers,[4] of which he had sole signatory authority.Â  Despite requests from Coker within days of the closing that Mallon place the funds in a proper escrow account, Mallon retained the funds in the separate account and maintained sole signatory authority.Â  As a result, HCH, individually and in a derivative capacity as a member of Dixie Holdings, brought suit against Mallon, Dixie Holdings, and Dixie Developers[5] on October 11, 2002.[6]Â  \r\nIn its complaint, HCH alleged five causes of action.Â  HCH requested:Â  (1) a judicial decree winding up and dissolving Dixie Holdings; (2) a full and complete accounting of Dixie Holdings including transfers between it and Dixie Developers and Mallon; (3) injunctive relief reversing Mallonâ€™s diversion of funds and restraining Mallon from taking any action that would damage either HCH or Dixie Holdingsâ€™ interests; (4) a declaratory judgment regarding each memberâ€™s rights pursuant to section 15-53-10 of the South Carolina Code; and (5) attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to section 33-44-1104 of the South Carolina Code.Â  In addition to these causes of action, HCH requested the court award â€œfull relief under Section 33-44-801, an accounting, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, fair distribution, attorneyâ€™s fees, pre-judgment interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate.â€Â  \r\nAfter the circuit court referred the case to a master-in-equity, Mallon submitted an answer.Â  In his answer, Mallon asserted â€œan accounting is appropriate for both parties, and that Coker, who acted as the financial officer of Dixie [Holdings] has repeatedly and improperly failed to prepare a proper accounting, which should now be done.â€Â  Mallon also claimed entitlement to reimbursement for services he performed on various properties of Dixie Holdings that exceeded the proceeds Dixie Holdings received from the sale of 15 Felix Street.Â Â  \r\nImmediately prior to trial, the master heard several motions in limine submitted by HCH.Â  In one motion, HCH requested the exclusion of any documents not submitted prior to November 21, 2003, when the parties exchanged discovery.Â  The master granted HCHâ€™s request.Â  Mallon did not object to the masterâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nThe master proceeded with a trial on the issues raised by the parties.Â  At trial, Mallon presented a statement of charges in which he claimed he was owed $9,280 for work performed on four Felix Street properties, including $1,900 for work performed on 15 Felix Street.Â  In his order, the master denied Mallonâ€™s request for an accounting concluding he had â€œnot timely requested, and waived, any right to an accounting.â€Â  The master also determined Mallon was not entitled to reimbursement for any alleged expenses associated with properties owned by Dixie Holdings or Dixie Developers because the parties had a â€œcourse of dealing of determining expenses prior to property sales and paying authorized expenses from the sale proceeds.â€Â  The master found HCH was entitled to receive one-half of the proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street, plus prejudgment interest on its half of the proceeds at the rate of 8.75% from the closing date of 15 Felix Street until the entry of judgment.Â  Finally, the master awarded HCH attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to section 33-44-1104 of the South Carolina Code â€œbased upon the record, the Affidavit of Counsel, and the factors applying to an award of fees and costs . . . .â€Â  \r\nThe master directed Mallon to turn over the proceeds from 15 Felix Street to HCHâ€™s counsel to be disbursed to HCH thirty days after the entry of his order.Â  The master also authorized HCH to deliver articles of termination pursuant to section 33-44-805 of the South Carolina Code to the Secretary of State for filing.Â  No post-trial motions were filed, and this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn the underlying action, HCH sued in a derivative capacity for an accounting and injunctive relief.Â  Actions for an accounting, for an injunction, and shareholder derivative actions are all actions in equity.Â  See Lee v. Lee, 251 S.C. 533, 536, 164 S.E.2d 308, 309 (1968) (holding an action against a guardian ad litem for misappropriated funds was essentially an action for an accounting which was equitable in nature); Wiedemann v. Town of Hilton Head, 344 S.C. 233, 236, 542 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œActions for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.â€); Anthony v. Padmar, 320 S.C. 436, 445, 465 S.E.2d 745, 750 (Ct. App. 1995) (noting that derivative actions are equitable).Â  In an action in equity referred to a master for final judgment, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â \r\nVan Blarcum v. City of N. Myrtle Beach,\r\n337 S.C. 446, 450, 523 S.E.2d 486, 488 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, we should not ignore the findings of the trial judge, who had the opportunity to hear and observe the witnesses.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Accounting\r\nMallon argues the master erred in refusing to order an accounting because one was necessary prior to the dissolution of Dixie Holdings.[7]Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe Uniform Limited Liability Company Act outlines certain procedures for actions brought by members of a limited liability company.Â  Section 33-44-410 allows a member to maintain an action against the limited liability company or another member â€œfor legal or equitable relief, with or without an accountingâ€ to enforce, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(1) the memberâ€™s rights under the operating agreement;\r\n(2) the memberâ€™s rights under this chapter; and\r\n(3) the rights that otherwise protect the interests of the member, including rights and interests arising independently of the memberâ€™s relationship to the company.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-410 (a) (Supp. 2004).Â  Certain events may cause the dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company, including where a member has applied for dissolution and there is a judicial decree to the effect that:\r\n\r\n(a) the economic purpose of the company is likely to be unreasonably frustrated;\r\n(b) another member has engaged in conduct relating to the companyâ€™s business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the companyâ€™s business with that member;\r\n(c) it is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the companyâ€™s business in conformity with the articles of organization and the operating agreement;\r\n(d) the company failed to purchase the petitionerâ€™s distributional interest after giving effect to provisions of the operating agreement modifying or superseding the provisions of Section 33-77-701; or\r\n(e) the managers or members in control of the company have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is unlawful, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner;\r\nÂ . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-801(4) (Supp. 2004).Â  In winding up the business of the limited liability company, the assets of the company must be applied to â€œdischarge its obligations to creditors, including members who are creditors,â€ with the surplus being paid to members in accordance with their right to distribution.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-806(a) (Supp. 2004).\r\nMembers of limited liability companies may enter into an operating agreement that outlines the procedures governing the affairs of the company.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-103 (Supp. 2004).Â  Operating agreements are binding contracts that are superior to statutory authority where they are in place.Â  However, to the extent that the operating agreement is silent as to some matter, statutory law will apply.Â  Id.Â  Thus, courts deciding a controversy between members must first evaluate a limited liability companyâ€™s operating agreement regarding a particular procedure prior to supplementing any areas not covered by the agreement with statutory law.Â Â  \r\nThe sections of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement pertinent to this discussion concern Mallonâ€™s claim for reimbursement and the need for an accounting.Â  Section 6.4 of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement provided that the company â€œshall reimburse Members for all authorized, direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Company.â€Â  In addition, the operating agreement contained the following provisions:Â  \r\nSection 12.4 Priority of Distribution of Assets.Â  In the event of a Termination Event and the Members do not elect to continue the business of the Company, the assets of the Company shall be distributed in the following order and priority: \r\n\r\n(a)&nbsp; To the payment of debts and liabilities of the Company (other than the Capital Contributions of the Members) and expenses of liquidation; \r\n(b)&nbsp; To the setting up any reserves . . . ; and\r\n(c)&nbsp; To each Member in accordance with their respective Membership Percentages. \r\n. . . .\r\nSection 12.6 Final Accounting.Â  Each of the Members shall be furnished with a statement setting forth the assets and liabilities of the Company as of the date of the complete liquidation.Â  Upon compliance by the Company with the foregoing distribution plan, the Members shall cease to be such, and they shall execute and cause to be filed any and all documents necessary with respect to termination and cancellation. \r\n\r\nRelying upon sections 33-44-410 and 33-44-801 of the South Carolina Code, the master noted that he had discretion to fashion a remedy short of an accounting.Â  The master concluded that Mallon, Dixie Holdings, and Dixie Developers failed to timely request an accounting and thus waived any right to have one.Â  Therefore, the master determined that awarding HCH 50% of the original proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street and dissolving Dixie Holdings was the appropriate remedy.Â  Although we recognize the master may grant relief to a member pursuant to section 33-44-410 without an accounting of the limited liability companyâ€™s business and the master has authority to order dissolution of a limited liability company pursuant to section 33-44-801, we find under these circumstances an accounting was necessary for the dissolution and winding up of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ business. \r\nDixie Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement required an accounting prior to dissolution.Â  In order for the master to determine what amounts are to be distributed to the members pursuant to section 12.4 of the operating agreement, he was first required to determine what assets Dixie Holdings owned at the time of dissolution.Â  Those assets cannot be determined until the debts and liabilities of the company are paid.Â  Thus, the master must first conduct an accounting to determine the balance of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ assets after the payment of liabilities, which presumably under the operating agreement includes reimbursements to members.Â  In addition, section 12.6 of the operating agreement contemplates a final accounting upon complete liquidation.Â  Although Coker gave Mallon a box containing some of the companyâ€™s financial records in 2000, that act did not amount to a formal accounting necessary for the dissolution of the company.Â  Because the operating agreement required an accounting, the master erred in ignoring this document.Â  \r\nFurther, even assuming the operating agreement was silent as to some aspect of winding up Dixie Holdings, we find an accounting was warranted pursuant to statute.Â  Section 33-44-410 provides that a member can sue the limited liability company or another member to enforce rights under the operating agreement and relief may include an accounting.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-410 (Supp. 2004).Â  In winding up the business of a limited liability company, courts are required to determine the assets, discharge obligations to creditors, and distribute the surplus to members.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-806(a) (Supp. 2004).Â  In most instances, including the present case, this task can only be accomplished after an accounting.Â  Accordingly, the master erred in ordering the dissolution and ultimately the distribution of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ assets without first requiring an accounting.\r\nIn addition to finding an accounting necessary under these circumstances, we find Mallon did not waive his right to an accounting. \r\n\r\nA waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.Â  Generally, the party claiming waiver must show that the party against whom waiver is asserted possessed, at the time, actual or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all the material facts upon which they depended.Â  \r\n\r\nJanasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime,\r\n307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387-88 (1992). \r\nHCH pled its right to an accounting in its complaint, to which Mallon assented in his answer.[8]Â  In response to HCHâ€™s motion for a directed verdict, Mallon argued that an accounting should be performed.Â  The record is void of any evidence of Mallonâ€™s voluntary and intentional abandonment of his right to an accounting.Â  Thus, the master erred in finding Mallon waived his right to an accounting and in not conducting an accounting pursuant to the dissolution and winding up of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ business.Â  \r\nFinally, HCH argues that no accounting was necessary because there were no debts after the master determined that Mallon had waived his right to setoff charges and the only asset to be distributed was the disputed $41,845.30.Â  This argument overlooks the fact that the parties were required by the operating agreement to have an accounting of all of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ business prior to dissolution.Â  The masterâ€™s findings that Mallon was not entitled to setoff and the fact that Dixie Holdingsâ€™ only remaining asset was the disputed amount will only serve to make this task easier. \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the masterâ€™s decision to deny the parties an accounting and remand this matter for a formal accounting of Dixie Holdings.Â  Our decision to remand this matter for an accounting affects other aspects of the masterâ€™s award to HCH.Â  Because the proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street are the property of Dixie Holdings until a final accounting is performed, we must also reverse the masterâ€™s decision to award one-half of the proceeds to HCH.Â  Further, because we reverse the award to HCH, we must likewise reverse the associated award of prejudgment interest.Â  The proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street shall be held in an escrow account for the benefit of Dixie Holdings until a final accounting is performed and the appropriate amounts distributed accordingly.[9]Â  \r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs\r\nMallon argues the master erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to HCH.Â  Mallon contends because HCH asserted its own rights and not those of Dixie Holdings, HCHâ€™s action is not a derivative action.Â  Mallon also argues the attorney fee affidavit provided by counsel for HCH was not sufficient.Â  In addition, Mallon contends the master erred in not making specific findings required to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Finally, Mallon argues Coker created the necessity for the action because he failed to provide a proper accounting.\r\nWe find most of Mallonâ€™s arguments not preserved for our review.Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â \r\nLucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â  When a trial court fails to address the specific argument raised by the appellant, the appellant must make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument.Â  In the absence of such a motion, the matter is not preserved and the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal.Â \r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).Â  In addition, when raising an issue through an objection, the â€œobjection must be sufficiently specific to inform the trial court of the point being urged by the objector.â€Â \r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).\r\nHCH asserted in its complaint its entitlement to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to section 33-44-1104 of the South Carolina Code.Â  This section provides: \r\n\r\nIf a derivative action for a limited liability company is successful, in whole or in part, or if anything is received by the plaintiff as a result of a judgment, compromise, or settlement of an action or claim, the court may award the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, and shall direct the plaintiff to remit to the limited liability company the remainder of the proceeds received.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-1104 (Supp. 2004).Â  At trial, counsel for HCH submitted an attorney fee affidavit into evidence arguing HCHâ€™s entitlement to these fees pursuant to section 33-44-1104.Â  Mallonâ€™s counsel responded with the following: â€œI do not concede, the Defendant does not concede that his client is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees in this case.Â  I donâ€™t take issue with the number of hours that he proposed, or the usual things, the amount of the hours he worked, attorney time, assistant time . . . .â€Â  However, Mallonâ€™s counsel did not further specify the reason for his objection, other than the following statement: â€œMr. Cokerâ€™s hand is so heavy in causing this problem to come about, that being equitable, you would find that my client, according to the facts in the record, that each party pays their own attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  \r\nTherefore, we find Mallonâ€™s argument that HCHâ€™s action did not meet the requirements for a derivative action not preserved for our review.Â  Additionally, Mallonâ€™s counsel specifically conceded to the sufficiency of the attorney fee affidavit and, therefore, cannot take issue with it on appeal.Â  See \r\nTNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (1998) (â€œAn issue conceded in a lower court may not be argued on appeal.â€).\r\nIn regard to Mallonâ€™s assertion that the master did not make sufficient findings with regard to his award of attorneyâ€™s fees, we find this argument not preserved for our review and, in addition, it is without merit.Â  \r\nWhen a trial court makes a general ruling on an issue, but does not address the specific argument raised by the appellant and the appellant does not make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal.Â \r\nNoisette, 304 S.C. at 58, 403 S.E.2d at 124.\r\nThe master, in his order, stated:Â  â€œbased upon the record, the Affidavit of Counsel, and the factors applying to an award of fees and costs, that the Plaintiff is entitled to an award and that the total amount, $15,643[.]60, is reasonable.â€Â  Mallon, however, did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the masterâ€™s order.Â  Rather, Mallon argues the insufficiency of the masterâ€™s findings for the first time on appeal.Â  Therefore, we find this argument not preserved for our review.\r\nFinally, Mallon alleges Coker failed to turn over the books and records, which he claims precipitated this litigation.Â  Thus, he argues it was inequitable for the master to award HCH attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.Â \r\nWooten v. Wooten, 358 S.C. 54, 65, 594 S.E.2d 854, 860 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Although Mallon points to Cokerâ€™s failure to provide adequate company records as the catalyst to the underlying lawsuit, it is undisputed that HCH filed the lawsuit after repeated requests for Mallon to place Dixie Holdingsâ€™ funds from the sale of 15 Felix Street into a proper escrow account.Â  The master found Mallonâ€™s actions necessitated the lawsuit and awarded HCH attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We find the master did not abuse his discretion in awarding HCH attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Mallonâ€™s arguments supporting his contention that he is entitled to reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of Dixie Holdings and Dixie Developers are either not preserved for our review or are without merit.Â  Therefore, we affirm the masterâ€™s order concerning these expenses.Â  In addition, we find the master erred in not conducting an accounting pursuant to dissolving and winding up the business of Dixie Holdings.Â  We order the proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street to be placed in an escrow account for the benefit of Dixie Holdings.Â  Because we find the master erred in not conducting an accounting, he further erred in making a final distribution to HCH from the proceeds of the sale of 15 Felix Street.Â  Additionally, because we find the award to HCH in error, we find no award upon which to grant HCH prejudgment interest.Â  Finally, we find no error by the master in awarding HCH attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the masterâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]At some point prior to this action, Mallon and HCH bought Storenâ€™s interest in Dixie Holdings and Storen filed a Statement of Dissociation with the South Carolina Secretary of Stateâ€™s Office.Â  He was not a party to the underlying action and is not a party in this appeal.\r\n[2] From the record, it appears Cynthia Coker did not take an active role in HCH or Dixie Holdings.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Coker also performed financial duties for Dixie Developers until the company was sold to Mallon.Â  In fact, both Dixie Holdings and Dixie Developers utilized one banking account under the name of Dixie Developers.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Although both Mallon and Coker had signatory authority on the Dixie Developers bank account for both Dixie Holdings and Dixie Developers, Mallon opened a new account in the name of Dixie Developers for which he had sole signatory authority.Â  Further, at the time Mallon opened the new account, he was the sole member of Dixie Developers.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Neither Dixie Holdings nor Dixie Developers is a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n[6]Â  Dixie Holdingsâ€™ fourth and final property was sold in December 2001 and the proceeds were split equally.Â  Thus, Dixie Holdings no longer owns any property.Â  \r\n[7]Â  Mallon also asserts the master erred in limiting the scope of the underlying action to the 15 Felix Street property.Â  However, the substance of the argument in support of the first issue on appeal fails to address why the master erred in limiting the scope of the action to 15 Felix Street.Â  In addition, Mallon fails to cite any supporting authority for his position.Â  Therefore, Mallon abandoned this argument on appeal and we need not address it.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting that where a party fails to city any supporting authority or where the argument is merely a conclusory statement, the issue is deemed abandoned on appeal).\r\n[8]Â  Mallonâ€™s letter to the clerk of court, treated as his initial answer by the master, stated that there was a need for a full accounting and he desired arbitration.Â  In his formal answer later filed after obtaining counsel, Mallon initially states that he believes an accounting is appropriate for both parties.Â  Later in the formal answer, he alleges that HCH should be estopped from requesting an accounting from Mallon, Dixie Holdings, and Dixie Developers because Cokerâ€™s failure to maintain financial records rendered an accounting from them impossible.Â  Although HCH argues that the latter statement amounted to a wavier of the request for an accounting, we interpret it as merely an expression that Cokerâ€™s mismanagement of financial records frustrated the partiesâ€™ ability to conduct an accounting.Â  Thus, these sections can be consistently read together to indicate that Mallon still desired an accounting.\r\n[9]Â  Mallon raises several other issues on appeal, including whether the circuit court erred in:Â  (1) disallowing Mallonâ€™s charges for the Felix Street properties; (2) disallowing the charges involved with the Dixie Developers properties; (3) finding the relief granted was justified by Mallonâ€™s attempt to dissociate from Dixie Holdings; (4) excluding evidence of Cokerâ€™s self-dealing and misappropriation of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ funds; and (5) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The arguments in support of these issues, for the most part, either were not raised below or were presented in Mallonâ€™s brief in a conclusory manner without supporting authority.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court my not be considered on appeal); Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that failure to provide argument or supporting authority for an issue renders it abandoned).Â  Thus, these issues each have procedural problems that foreclose appellate review and we decline to address them.Â  However, we address the attorneyâ€™s fees issue to the extent it may be viewed as preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4005","title":"Waters v.

Barr, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n WILLIAMS, J.:Â  Ray Allen Waters appeals a circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company and Mitchell Harvey Bridwell.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1986, Appellant phoned Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company (â€œSouthern Farmâ€) to establish an insurance policy on the life of his wife, Brenda Waters.Â  An agent of Southern Farm visited the Watersâ€™ home and conducted an interview of Appellant and his wife.Â  During the course of the interview, the agent filled out the required application form on behalf of the couple.Â  Brenda Waters was designated in the application as the owner and insured of the policy and Appellant as its sole beneficiary.Â  The application contained the following statement, prompting the applicant to mark one of two boxes:Â  â€œOwner &#1649; does / &#1649; does not reserve the right to change the Beneficiary.â€Â Â  Neither box was marked on the application form. The agent submitted the application to Southern Farm and the life insurance policy was later issued.Â  The policy incorporated the application as part of the contract for insurance.\r\nIn 1999, Appellant and Brenda Waters separated.Â  Mrs. Waters, who was then suffering from brain cancer, moved in with her mother.Â  In July 1999, she submitted a â€œChange of Beneficiaryâ€ form to Southern Farm designating her brother, Richard Bridwell, as the new beneficiary.Â  In February 2000, Mrs. Waters submitted another â€œChange of Beneficiaryâ€ form amending the policy to designate Mitchell Bridwell, another brother, as the sole beneficiary.Â  Southern Farm complied with both requests, as confirmed by two change of beneficiary notices sent to Mrs. Waters.\r\nIn October 2000, Brenda Waters passed away.Â  Appellant attempted to collect on the Southern Farm life insurance policy, but the proceeds were paid to Mitchell Bridwell in accordance with the last change of beneficiary request.Â  Appellant brought suit, arguing the insurance contract was breached by denying a non-revocable beneficiary the proceeds of the policy.Â  The circuit court granted Southern Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the undisputed evidence reflected the partiesâ€™ intent that the owner could change the beneficiary and that Mrs. Waters had not waived her right to do so.Â  After Appellantâ€™s motion to alter or amend the circuit courtâ€™s order was denied, the present appeal was filed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  \r\nIn determining whether a triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  Even if there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in granting Southern Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment because the ownerâ€™s failure to declare her intention on the application regarding the right to change the beneficiary gives rise to an ambiguity in the insurance contract. We agree.[1]\r\nWhen an insurance policy does not reserve to the insured the right to change the beneficiary, â€œthe beneficiary, upon the issuance of the policy, acquires a vested interest in the proceeds of the insurance when available according to the terms of the policy, which cannot be divested by any act of the insured.â€Â  Antley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C. 23, 27, 137 S.E. 199, 200 (1927).Â  Of course an insured may expressly reserve the right to change the beneficiary, as was clearly contemplated by the ignored prompt in the application of the present case.Â  The right to change the beneficiary, however, may also be reserved by the language of the policy itself.Â  See Bost v. Volunteer State Life Ins. Co., 114 S.C. 405, 409, 103 S.E. 771, 772 (1920).Â  Because the owner failed to expressly indicate her intention to reserve or not to reserve this right in the present case, we look to the language of the policy for guidance.\r\nThe insurance policy in question addresses the right to change the beneficiary in three instances, two of which seem to reserve the right of the insured to change the beneficiary and one which seems to require that the right be expressly reserved upon application.Â  The schedule page of the policy defines the beneficiary as the person â€œnamed in the application, unless changed by owner.â€ (Emphasis added).Â  Section 7.1 of the policy, which contains the heading â€œBENEFICIARY,â€ likewise states â€œ[t]he Primary and Contingent Beneficiary are as named in the application, unless changed by the owner.â€ (Emphasis added).Â  Section 7.3, however, states, â€œ[i]f the right to change the Beneficiary has been reserved, the owner may change the Beneficiary during the Insuredâ€™s lifetime by filing written notice to the Company.â€ (Emphasis added).Â  Consequently, we find ambiguity in the language of the insurance contract.Â  While Section 7.3 seems to require an express reservation on the part of the applicant, Southern Farm promptly granted both of Mrs. Watersâ€™ requests to change the policyâ€™s beneficiary, further confounding the partiesâ€™ intent regarding this issue. \r\nâ€œWhere there is ambiguity, uncertainty or doubt as to proper construction of [an insurance] contract, intention of the parties becomes a question of fact for the jury to determine.â€Â  Garrett v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 241 S.C. 299, 305, 128 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1962).Â  After a consideration of extrinsic evidence, the jury is to resolve all remaining ambiguity in favor of the insured, in this case, the late Brenda Waters.Â  Id. at 304-305, 128 S.E.2d at 174.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n ANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Appellant first argues we should reverse the circuit court and rule in his favor as a matter of law.Â  For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we instead find an issue of fact for determination by a jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4006","title":"State v.

Shupe, and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  In this criminal appeal, we are asked to decide whether a defendant forfeits his right to make the final closing argument to the jury when he offers only non-testimonial evidence.Â  Brandon Pinkard was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.Â  On appeal, Pinkard claims error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling that his proposed display of a tattoo to the jury would constitute evidence, thereby depriving him of the right to make the last argument.Â  We affirm and hold the presentation of any evidence by a defendantâ€”whether characterized as testimonial or non-testimonialâ€”forfeits his right to make the last argument to the jury. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 7, 2000, during a fight outside an apartment complex between Pinkard and a third party, Roger Keitt intervened in an effort to ease tensions between the combatants.Â  According to witnesses, Pinkard responded by shooting and killing Keitt.Â  Pinkard was indicted for murder, convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a jury, and sentenced to 24 years imprisonment.Â  During trial, several witnesses identified Pinkard as the shooter, but none mentioned Pinkard as having a tattoo.Â  \r\nNear the trialâ€™s conclusion, Pinkard asked the trial court if he could show the jury a tattoo on his arm without forfeiting the right to make the final argument.Â  The trial court held that such a display of the tattoo would constitute the introduction of evidence and would thus preclude Pinkard from having the last argument.Â  Pinkard chose not to exhibit his tattoo to the jury in order to preserve his right to the final closing argument.Â  Pinkard appeals, claiming the trial court erred in ruling the display to the jury would constitute the introduction of evidence.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhen a defendant in a criminal case offers no evidence, he is entitled to the final closing argument to the jury.Â  State v. Rodgers, 269 S.C. 22, 24, 235 S.E.2d 808, 809 (1977) (citing State v. Gellis, 158 S.C. 471, 487, 155 S.E. 849, 855 (1930)).Â  â€œThe right to open and close the argument to the jury is a substantial right, the denial of which is reversible error.â€Â  Rodgers, 269 S.C. at 24-25, 235 S.E.2d at 809. \r\nWhile the display of physical characteristics, such as a tattoo, is non-testimonial,[1] it remains evidence.Â  See State v. Hart, 306 S.C. 344, 346, 412 S.E.2d 380, 381 (1991) (stating that exhibition of a defendantâ€™s physical characteristics is treated â€œlike any other evidenceâ€); 2 McCormick on Evidence Â§ 215 (5th ed. 1999) (noting that â€œ[t]he physical characteristics of a person may . . . constitute relevant evidence in a criminal prosecutionâ€) (emphasis added).Â  The trial court correctly ruled that the proposed display by Pinkard of his tattoo would have been evidence, albeit non-testimonial.Â  Accordingly, Pinkard was not entitled to display his tattoo to the jury and retain the right to the final closing argument. See Gellis, 158 S.C. at 487, 155 S.E. at 855 (1930) (holding that the state retains the right to the final closing â€œif a defendant offers any evidence on trial of the caseâ€); cf. State v. Mouzon, 326 S.C. 199, 203-04, 485 S.E.2d 918, 920-21 (1997) (noting that a jury view of the crime scene pursuant to South Carolina Code section 14-7-1320 â€œis not regarded as evidenceâ€ and that defendant was therefore â€œentitled to the last closing argumentâ€).\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] â€œTestimonyâ€ is not synonymous with â€œevidenceâ€; the latter is a more comprehensive term.Â  Evidence is said to be testimonial when â€œelicited from a witness in contrast to documentary evidence or real evidence.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1476 (6th ed. 1990); see also Schmerber v.

Long, III, of Conway, for Appellant. \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor J. Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â Deral L. Stanley (Deral) appeals from his conviction for trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  Deral argues: (1) he was prejudiced when the trial court ordered the imprisonment of a witness who contradicted his prior statement to the police on the witness stand, and then later allowed the witness to return to testify; and (2) the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the night of June 12, 2003, Officer Will Lynch, a traffic officer for the City of North Myrtle Beach, was operating a radar detector on Possum Trot Road.Â  He determined that an oncoming vehicle was traveling approximately twelve miles per hour over the posted speed limit.Â  Officer Lynch, who was on a motorcycle, began to follow the vehicle and activated his blue lights.Â  A high-speed chase ensued.Â  Officer Lynch observed two people in the fleeing vehicle.Â  The driver of the vehicle attempted to pass another car, but instead he struck the median, â€œspun out,â€ and came to a stop without hitting any other vehicles.\r\nAs Officer Lynch approached, the driver exited the disabled vehicle and ran across the street into the parking lot of a nearby miniature golf course.Â  The passenger in the vehicle was Deral Stanley.Â  When Officer Lynch pulled up to the scene of the accident, Deral exited the vehicle and began to walk away.Â  Officer Lynch immediately ordered Deral to get on the ground, handcuffed Deral, and arrested him.\r\nOfficer Lynch rolled Deral over to check him for weapons.Â  At that time, he â€œnoticed down on the ground where [Deral] was laying a large bag of what appeared to . . . be crack cocaine.â€Â  Officer Lynch declared: â€œWhen I rolled him over, basically, they were right in the areaâ€”I guess you would say if I was to roll him back down, basically, around his belly button area.â€Â  Officer Lynch retrieved the bag, which SLED later determined contained 22.63 grams of crack cocaine.Â  When Officer Lynch patted Deral down, he found $4,220 in cash in his pockets.Â  An inventory search of the vehicle revealed other drug paraphernaliaâ€”plastic baggies and digital scalesâ€”on the passenger-side floorboard.\r\nThe driver of the vehicle was Richard Stanley (Richard), Deralâ€™s cousin.Â  Richard was apprehended soon afterward.Â  He was cited for speeding and charged with failure to stop for a blue light and driving without a license.\r\nWhen he arrived at the police station, Richard waived his rights and gave a statement to Officer Mandy Little.Â  Officer Little wrote down what Richard said and then he signed it at the bottom.Â  The substance of the statement was that Richard was driving Deral to â€œsell somebody somethingâ€ when they â€œsaw blue lights.â€Â  According to Richard, Deral instructed him â€œto go,â€ and Richard â€œwent because he got scared and had no license.â€\r\nAt trial, the State called Richard.Â  When the State asked Richard if his signature was on his statement, he hesitated.Â  The trial judge sent the jury out and asked whether the statement had been made under oath.Â  The State asserted the statement was made under oath, although defense counsel disagreed.[1]Â  The trial judge then warned Richard that if his trial testimony differed substantially from his prior statement he could be indicted for perjury.\r\nWhen the jury returned, Richard admitted his signature was on the statement.Â  However, he denied any prior mention of selling something, claiming â€œI ainâ€™t said nothing about going to sell nothing.â€Â  He further denied telling Officer Little that the drugs belonged to Deral.Â  In fact, Richard stated the drugs belonged to him, not Deral.Â  Richard testified he gave the money to Deral during the car chase.Â  He said the baggies and scales were on the center console, but had fallen onto the passenger side floorboard during the accident.Â  Richard declared he threw the bag of drugs when he exited the car, and Deral must have accidentally fallen on it when he was arrested.Â  After his testimony, the trial judge asked Richard to remain in the courtroom because he might be subject to recall.\r\nAfter the judge dismissed the jury for the afternoon, he called Richard forward and the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Under oath you just testified that you are guilty in trafficking in cocaine.Â  You said that under oath. \r\nMR. RICHARD STANLEY:Â  Yes, sir. \r\nTHE COURT:Â  Arrest this individual.Â  Put him in jail.Â  Leave him there.Â  Heâ€™s either guilty by his own admission in trafficking in cocaine or heâ€™s guilty of perjury. \r\nHeâ€™s to go to jail.Â  Have him indicted first thing in the morning. \r\nI will not permit that sort of conduct in my courtroom. \r\nNow, heâ€™s, obviously, either guilty of trafficking in cocaine or heâ€™s lying. \r\nYou agree with that, [Defense Counsel].Â  He canâ€™t have it both ways.\r\nMR. LONG:Â  Thatâ€™s correct, Your Honor. \r\nTHE COURT:Â  Alright.\r\nHe will remain in jail. \r\nLet the record reflect that Iâ€™m also putting him in jail tonight in the event we will need him for further testimony in the morning.Â  He may be subject to recall, being under that I want to make sure heâ€™s here for recall by either the State or the defendant.\r\nBut I want him indicted in the morning. \r\n\r\nThe following morning, the judge appointed the Senior Public Defender to act as counsel for Richard and asked her to speak with him along with the Solicitor.Â  Richard was not served with a warrant at that time.Â  Richard was then brought into the courtroom and charged as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  They [are] going to put you back on the stand under oath and all the Court wants from youâ€”Iâ€™mÂ Â  not interested in who you help or hurt.Â  All Iâ€™m interested in is you tell us the truth and the absolute truth and nothing but the truth.Â  Do you understand that?\r\n\r\nRichard responded, â€œYes, sir.â€Â  Richard then recanted his earlier testimony.Â  Richard professed that the drugs belonged to Deral and that Deral was going to sell them.Â  On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony that Richard had been â€œlocked upâ€ the night before and threatened with service of warrants for trafficking in cocaine and perjury.\r\nAfter the State rested, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of not guilty.Â  Additionally, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the trial judgeâ€™s handling of Richardâ€™s testimony.Â  The judge denied both motions.\r\nDeral testified in his own defense.Â  Deral claimed Richard was driving because he had been drinking.Â  Deral stated Richard gave him the money during the car chase.Â  He denied possessing the drugs, vowing â€œI didnâ€™t have no drugs on me.â€Â  On cross-examination, Deral admitted having conversations with Richard in which he learned that Richard would â€œtake the blameâ€ for the drug charge.\r\nAt the close of the evidence, defense counsel renewed his motions for a directed verdict and a mistrial.Â  Both motions were again denied.Â  The jury found Deral guilty of trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  Because Deral had two prior convictions, he received the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five years.Â  Defense counsel made post-trial motions for a mistrial, a new trial, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the judge denied.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motion for Mistrial\r\nDeral argues the trial judgeâ€™s handling of Richardâ€™s testimony was erroneous.Â  Deral alleges prejudice in that the trial judgeâ€™s conduct amounted to intimidation of a witness.Â  He claims the judge should have granted his motion for a mistrial.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Issue Preservation\r\nInitially, we note this issue may not have been properly preserved.Â  Although defense counsel moved for a mistrial after the State rested, no contemporaneous objection was made.Â  Instead, when the trial judge ordered Richard sent to jail, he stated: â€œYou agree with that, Mr. Long.Â  He canâ€™t have it both ways.â€Â  Deralâ€™s attorney replied: â€œThatâ€™s correct, Your Honor.â€Â  Our courts have held a failure to contemporaneously object to the introduction of evidence claimed to be prejudicial cannot be later bootstrapped by a motion for a mistrial.Â  State v. Lynn, 277 S.C. 222, 284 S.E.2d 786 (1981); State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 451 S.E.2d 34 (Ct. App. 1994); State v. Wilkins, 310 S.C. 81, 425 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 1992); see also State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004) (contemporaneous objection required to preserve error for appellate review); State v. Atchison, 268 S.C. 588, 235 S.E.2d 294 (1977) (noting that if a party fails to make a proper contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence, he cannot later raise the issue by a motion for mistrial); State v. Crosby,&nbsp;348 S.C. 387, 398-399, 559 S.E.2d 352, 358-59&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001), revâ€™d on other grounds, 355 S.C. 47, 584 S.E.2d 110 (2003) (holding that no issue is preserved for appellate review if the objecting party accepts the judgeâ€™s ruling and does not contemporaneously make an additional objection to sufficiency of the curative charge or move for a mistrial).\r\nB.Â  Mistrial\r\nIn any event, even if preserved, we find the issue to be without merit.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Â State v. Vazquez, Op. No. 25975 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 25, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 43); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The courtâ€™s decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); see also State v. Arnold, 266 S.C. 153, 157, 221 S.E.2d 867, 868 (1976) (noting the general rule of this State is that â€œthe ordering of, or refusal of a motion for mistrial is within the discretion of the trial judge and such discretion will not be overturned in the absence of abuse thereof amounting to an error of law.â€).\r\nâ€œâ€˜The power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causesâ€™ stated into the record by the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 354, 573 S.E.2d 856, 862 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 236 S.E.2d 33 (1977)); see also State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating mistrial should only be granted in cases of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons).Â  The granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); Adams, 354 S.C. at 377, 580 S.E.2d at 793.\r\nA mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  Harris, 340 S.C. at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 628; Simmons, 352 S.C. at 354, 573 S.E.2d at 862; see also State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (finding mistrial should not be granted unless absolutely necessary; to receive mistrial, defendant must show error and resulting prejudice).Â  â€œThe less than lucid test is therefore declared to be whether the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the ends of public justice.â€Â  State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1983).Â  â€œWhether a mistrial is manifestly necessary is a fact specific inquiry.â€Â  State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 457, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nC.Â  Section 16-9-10\r\nDeral contends that Richardâ€™s testimony at trial was not perjury because the police statement was not made under oath.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 16-9-10 of the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A)(1) It is unlawful for a person to wilfully give false, misleading, or incomplete testimony under oath in any court of record, judicial, administrative, or regulatory proceeding in this State.\r\n(2) It is unlawful for a person to wilfully give false, misleading, or incomplete information on a document, record, report, or form required by the laws of this State.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-10 (2003).\r\nâ€œGiving false testimony at trial constitutes the felony of perjury and subjects the perjurer to a fine and/or up to five years imprisonment.â€Â  Collins v. Doe,&nbsp;343 S.C. 119, 124, 539 S.E.2d 62, 64&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds, 352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002).Â  Perjury or false swearing may constitute contempt of court.Â  See, e.g., Crute v. Crute, 70 S.E.2d 727 (Ga. Ct. App. 1952).\r\nIn the case sub judice, Richardâ€™s initial trial testimony directly contradicted his prior testimony given in a police statement.Â  Giving false information in a document or report required by the laws of this State is perjury.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-10(A)(2).Â  Thus, if the information given to Officer Little was false, Richard was guilty of perjury.Â  If the information was true, Richard perjured himself on the stand by contradicting it under subsection (A)(1).\r\nD.Â  Arrest of Witness\r\nDeral maintains he was prejudiced when Richard was arrested and sent to jail, and then later returned to reverse his prior testimony.Â  This assertion is meritless.\r\nâ€œIt is the duty of the court to exercise supervision and control over the witnesses in attendance at the trial.â€Â  23A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1191 (1989).Â  In South Carolina, it is firmly settled that the presiding judge has the right to order the arrest of a witness in open court who has made contradictory statements amounting to perjury.Â  The supreme court addressed this issue in State v. McKay, 89 S.C. 234, 71 S.E. 858 (1911):\r\n\r\nWhen the witness Purvis came off the stand, the solicitor ordered the sheriff, in open court, to arrest him and take him to jail to answer an indictment for perjury.Â  This was done against defendantâ€™s protest.Â  It is alleged that this was prejudicial to defendant, because it was calculated to intimidate any other witness from varying the testimony which he had given at the preliminary investigation.Â  There is nothing in the record tending to show any such prejudice.Â  It is purely conjectural and barely possible, but highly improbable.Â  Therefore it affords no ground for reversal.Â  On the contrary, we are inclined to commend prompt action by those charged with the administration of the law, when it has been flagrantly violated; and we are of the opinion that if perjurers were more invariably and promptly and vigorously prosecuted and punished, there would be fewer miscarriages of justice in our courts.\r\n\r\nId. at 236, 71 S.E. at 859.Â  Thereafter, in State v. Campbell, 150 S.C. 449, 148 S.E. 472 (1929), the supreme court explained:\r\n\r\nThe second question is as to the right of the presiding judge to order the arrest of a witness in open court who, in the opinion of the trial judge, has made contradictory statements, which in fact amount to perjury.Â  This question has been settled against the appellant by the case of State v. McKay, 89 S.C. 234, 71 S.E. 858 [(1911)].Â  The trial judge is present in the atmosphere of the trial, and he must, in the administration of justice, uphold the dignity of the courts, and he would be derelict in his duty if he did not take such steps as he conceives it his duty to see that justice is administered in accordance with sound principles of law.Â  It might be said in passing that it does not appear in the case for appeal that the judge actually had the witness arrested, and under the rules of this court no exception can be considered which does not find substantiation in the printed case.\r\n\r\nId. at 450-51, 148 S.E. at 473; see also H.D. Warren, Annotation, Statements, Comments, or Conduct of Court or Counsel Regarding Perjury as Ground for New Trial or Reversal in Civil Action or Criminal Prosecution Other Than for Perjury, 127 A.L.R. 1385 (1940) (citing McKay and Campbell and noting that South Carolina courts have used language which seems to indicate the mere fact that a commitment for perjury is made or ordered is insufficient to establish prejudice or constitute reversible error, but indicating that such a result may be shown in a proper case).\r\nIn Graves v. State, 309 S.C. 307, 422 S.E.2d 125 (1992), our supreme court articulated:\r\n\r\nPetitioner also alleges that the trial judgeâ€™s comments on credibility about a defense witness denied him an impartial jury and violated his due process rights.Â  Again, the PCR judge found this issue to be without merit.Â  At the PCR hearing, petitioner alleged that the trial judgeâ€™s threats of perjury to a witness prejudiced him.Â  Petitioner argues that the trial judgeâ€™s comments amounted to comments on the credibility of a witness.Â  During cross-examination, the trial judge reminded the witness: â€œYou are under oath subject to perjury.Â  I need to warn you, so you must answer the questions truthfully.â€Â  Further, he stated: â€œThe jury can hear. They can find out whether or not you are straightforward or not.Â  Those are matters for the jury.â€\r\nPetitioner argues that this Court should adopt the holding of the North Carolina case of State v. Rhodes, 290 N.C. 16, 224 S.E.2d 631 (1976), where the court held that any intimation by the judge in the juryâ€™s presence that a witness had committed perjury would be reversible error.Â  Rhodes, however, is distinguishable from the present case.Â  In Rhodes, the trial judge made a long statement regarding the witnessâ€™ testimony and he clearly thought she had committed perjury.Â  In Rhodes, the North Carolina Supreme Court stated that a judge may caution a witness regarding perjury outside of the juryâ€™s presence.Â  However, the court cautioned that any intimation that a witness had committed perjury in the juryâ€™s presence is reversible error.\r\nIn Rhodes, the court set forth several reasons for its holding.Â  The court saw several dangers including the fact that a judge is unlikely to warn a witness about perjury unless he has determined that the witness has committed perjury which is a fact solely for the juryâ€™s determination.Â  Secondly, a witness may change his testimony after being threatened with perjury charges.Â  Third, a warning may discourage questioning the witness further.\r\nAs to whether the comments could be construed as a factual determination by the judge, the trial judge stated whether the witness committed perjury was for the jury to determine.Â  From a review of the testimony of the witness, the trial judgeâ€™s comments did not cause her to change her testimony or discourage further questions.\r\nWhile these reasons set forth in Rhodes are valid, we decline to apply the holding to the present case.Â  Although the trial judge should have refrained from cautioning the witness regarding perjury in the presence of the jury, under the circumstances of this case, we do not think it is reversible error.Â  We find the trial judgeâ€™s comments do not amount to prejudice which denied petitioner an impartial jury or violated his due process rights.\r\n\r\nId. at 311-12, 422 S.E.2d at 127-28; see also State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 546, 514 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1999) (â€œ[T]here is generally no prejudice when the trial courtâ€™s hostile comments are made outside the juryâ€™s presence.â€).\r\nAll courts have inherent power to punish for contempt.Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 (1982); State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 611 S.E.2d 273 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This power is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and the due administration of justice.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe trial judge acted within his discretion to warn Richard and to take action to prevent the miscarriage of justice by his perjury.\r\nE.Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\nThe South Carolina rule is in accord with that of other jurisdictions.Â  In State v. Sheffield, 228 P.2d 431 (N.M. 1951), the trial testimony of a Stateâ€™s witness contradicted earlier statements given to police officers.Â  The Supreme Court of New Mexico, citing State v. McKay and State v. Campbell, amplified:\r\n\r\nIt appears from the record that, during the progress of the trial, in the presence of the jury, and while Oscar Connally was on the stand testifying as a witness for the State, the court told the district attorney to â€œenter a contempt charge against this man for perjury and to deliver him to the custody of the sheriff.â€\r\nThe action of the court was within the power and sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  That it might have had a bad effect upon the jury, and thereby prejudiced the defendantâ€™s case, was a matter to be considered by the trial judge at the time he committed the witness to the custody of the sheriff, but we do no[t] think it was error to do so under the circumstances.Â  State v. McKay, 89 S.C. 234, 71 S.E. 858; State v. Campbell, 150 S.C. 449, 148 S.E. 472; People v. Hayes, 140 N.Y. 484, 35 N.E. 951, 23 L.R.A. 830, 37 Am.St.Rep. 572; Beavers v. U.S., 6 Cir., 3 F.2d 860.\r\n\r\nId. at 431.Â  Thereafter, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico inculcated:\r\n\r\nDefendantâ€™s assertion that the trial judgeâ€™s comments resulted in the intimidation of Miss Saiz, causing her to change her testimony against defendant, is a matter of first impression in this jurisdiction.Â  Defendant contends the court overstepped the neutral role assigned to trial judges and impermissibly intruded upon the traditional functions assigned to advocates.Â  Defendant relies upon State v. Caputo, 94 N.M. 190, 608 P.2d 166 (App. 1980) and In Re Will of Callaway, 84 N.M. 125, 500 P.2d 410 (1972).\r\nThe test of whether a trial judge has acted impermissibly in intimidating a witness turns on whether the judgeâ€™s comments were so severe that they resulted in the witnessâ€™s refusal to testify or to totally change testimony.Â  Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972); McNutt v. United States, 267 F. 670 (8th Cir. 1920); see also Annot. 127 A.L.R. 1385 (1940).\r\nA trial judge is not required to sit idly by and allow perjury to be committed without bringing it to the attention of proper authorities.Â  State v. Brown, 124 Ariz. 97, 602 P.2d 478 (1979).Â  A judge has a responsibility for safeguarding both the rights of the accused and the rights of the public in the administration of criminal justice.Â  ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Â§ 6-1.1 (2d ed. 1980).Â  However, in a jury trial, the court must not in any manner, by demeanor or otherwise, comment upon the weight to be given certain evidence or indicate an opinion as to the credibility of a witness.Â  See N.M.U.J.I.Crim. 1.00, 40.20, N.M.S.A. 1978 (Repl. 1982).Â  It is not error to advise a witness outside the presence of the jury of the consequences of perjury or to caution him about testifying truthfully, when the need arises because of some statement or action of the witness.Â  Ehrlick v. Commonwealth, 33 Ky. 977, 112 S.W. 565 (App. 1908).\r\nDetermination of whether the actions of the trial court amounted to intimidation of a witness must rest upon the facts of each case.Â  State v. Harris, 428 S.W.2d 497 (Mo. 1968); Young v. United States, 107 F.2d 490 (5th Cir. 1939); Venable v. State, 84 Tex. Cr. App. 354, 207 S.W. 520 (1918).\r\nHere, the trial court excused the jury prior to advising the witness as to the penalty for perjury.Â  Outside the presence of the jury, it ordered that she be provided with appointed counsel and recessed the trial to allow her opportunity to consult with an attorney.Â  At the resumption of the witnessâ€™s testimony the following day, she testified in accordance with her pretrial statement obtained by the prosecution, and which had been previously furnished to the defense.Â  The actions of Judge Cole in cautioning the witness concerning the consequences of possible perjury, and acting to provide her with the assistance of counsel was entirely proper under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nState v. Martinez, 653 P.2d 879, 884 (N.M. Ct. App. 1982).\r\nIn a federal case, the district court expounded:\r\n\r\nThe petitionerâ€™s second allegation is that he was denied a fair trial due to the prejudice of the trial judge.Â  Petitionerâ€™s main contention rests upon the fact that he claims that it was prejudice for the trial judge to instruct his brother on the possible consequences of perjury after his brother began to testify on behalf of the petitioner.Â  (The courtâ€™s remarks were made to the brother outside the presence of the jury).Â  Since the courtâ€™s advice was given after his brother had completely contradicted the testimony of the police officer, it is apparent that such instruction was necessary and well within the discretion of the trial judge. After an examination of the entire record, it is apparent that this allegation of the petitioner is frivolous and provides no basis for the relief that has been requested.\r\n\r\nMooney v. United States, 320 F. Supp. 316, 318 (E.D. Mo. 1970).Â  An accused is not prejudiced by proceedings for perjury undertaken against a witness outside the presence of the jury.Â  See 23A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1190 (1989).Â  A New York court determined that a defendant was not denied a fair trial when the trial judge warned a witness that he was subjecting himself to possible perjury charges due to frequent lack of recall, and then allowed the witness to return several days later to continue his testimony.Â  People v. Stanley, 519 N.Y.S.2d 761 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987), overruled on other grounds by People v. Butler, 596 N.Y.S.2d 93 (N.Y. App. Div. 1993).\r\nThe trial judge, outside the presence of the jury, warned Richard about the consequences of perjury.Â  When Richard persisted in contradicting his prior testimony, the trial judge ordered him committed to jail after dismissing the jury.Â  Richard was given the opportunity to consult with counsel and then was allowed to return and testify after being charged to tell only the truth.Â  Although the jury eventually learned of the threatened charges, Deral has no basis for complaint because his own counsel elicited this information on cross-examination.\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Deralâ€™s motion for a mistrial.[2]\r\nII.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nDeral contends the trial judge erred in denying his directed verdict motion.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004); State v. McLauren, 349 S.C. 488, 563 S.E.2d 346 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIf there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State v. Follin, 352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove accusedâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); State v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 608 S.E.2d 886&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).\r\nThe trial judge should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 610 S.E.2d 859 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 584 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The appellate court may reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).\r\nâ€œA person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of ten grams or more of ice, crank, or crack cocaine . . . is guilty of . . . â€˜trafficking in . . . crack cocaine.â€™â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C) (2002) (emphasis added).Â  Actual possession occurs when the drugs are found to be in the actual physical custody of the person charged with possession.Â  State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 470 S.E.2d 851 (1996); State v. Hudson, 277 S.C. 200, 284 S.E.2d 773 (1981).Â  In order to prove constructive possession, the State must show the defendant had dominion and control, or the right to exercise dominion and control, over either the drugs or the premises upon which the drugs are found.Â  Ballenger, 322 S.C. at 199, 470 S.E.2d at 854.Â  Such possession can be established by circumstantial or direct evidence or a combination of the two.Â  State v. Brown, 267 S.C. 311, 227 S.E.2d 674 (1976).Â  Possession requires more than mere presence.Â  State v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. 22, 524 S.E.2d 637 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The State must show the defendant had dominion or control over the thing allegedly possessed or had the right to exercise dominion or control over it.Â  Id.\r\nIn the instant case, the record provides substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove Deralâ€™s guilt.Â  Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there was substantial circumstantial evidence to submit the charge to the jury.Â  The arresting officer found a large bag containing more than ten grams of crack cocaine on the ground beneath Deral.Â  He discovered $4,220 in cash in Deralâ€™s pockets and plastic bags and scales on the passengerâ€™s side floorboard of the vehicle.Â  Deral had been sitting in the passenger seat.Â  Richardâ€™s statement to the police that he was driving Deral to â€œsell somebody somethingâ€ shows intent to distribute.Â  After Richard recanted, he testified that neither the drugs nor the money belonged to him.Â  Moreover, Richard declared that the bags and scales were Deralâ€™s.Â  Furthermore, Deral admitted having conversations with Richard regarding the perjured testimony.\r\nThe trial judge did not err in denying Deralâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by warning a witness, out of the presence of the jury, of the consequences of perjury and committing him to jail when he gave testimony contradicting his prior statement.Â  Deral was not prejudiced when the witness returned and reversed his earlier testimony at trial.Â  There was substantial circumstantial evidence in the record to deny Deralâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  Accordingly, Deralâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The statement form contained the following language: â€œI am giving this statement to Off. Little.Â  I volunteer the following information of my own free will, for whatever purpose it may serve. . . . I certify that the facts contained herein are true and correct.â€\r\n[2]  Deral maintains the trial judge erred in commanding the State to charge Richard with trafficking.Â  Deral avers this conduct violates the separation of powers doctrine in which the Executive Branch is vested with sole and unfettered discretion to decide when and how to prosecute a case.Â  See State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341 (1994).Â  We do not reach this issue because nothing in the record indicates Richard was ever actually charged with trafficking.Â  See State v. Campbell, 150 S.C. 449, 148 S.E. 472 (1929) (noting that no grounds for appeal exist when the record does not substantiate that the conduct complained of ever occurred).Â  Because the nature of the charges would not affect the prejudice to Deral, this issue would be more appropriate for consideration in Richardâ€™s trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
