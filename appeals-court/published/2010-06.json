Thomas (collectively Homeowners) filed this action against\r\n  Snee Farm Community Foundation and Jackie Walker, President (collectively the\r\n  Foundation) seeking injunctive relief based on alleged irregularities in the\r\n  2007 election of directors to the Foundation. The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment to the Foundation.Â  Homeowners appeal. We vacate and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Snee Farm Subdivision contains approximately 890\r\n  homes, including single-family homes and townhouses, amenities, and open space\r\n  restricted by deed for recreational use. The current owner of the open space\r\n  sought to develop a portion of the open space. The proposal generated strong\r\n  feelings in the community, both for and against the proposal. \r\nHomeowners\r\n  live in the Snee Farm Subdivision, which is subject to the by-laws of the\r\n  Foundation. The Foundation is governed by the Board of Directors. Directors are\r\n  elected to the Board and serve staggered three-year terms. At the time of the\r\n  election and this action, Jackie Walker was a director and president of the\r\n  Board. \r\nAccording\r\n  to Homeowners, Walker interfered in the 2007 election process to fill the Board\r\n  with directors that supported the development proposal. Homeowners filed this\r\n  action alleging, inter alia, Walker inappropriately placed herself on\r\n  the nominating committee, and the 2007 election for Board members was invalid. Homeowners\r\n  and the Foundation moved for summary judgment. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court held a hearing on the motions. The Foundation argued: (1) the\r\n  nominating committee's actions and election were conducted according to the\r\n  by-laws; (2) the business judgment rule applied to the conduct of the Board;\r\n  and (3) the issue was moot because another election would soon be held. In a\r\n  form order without any stated grounds for its decision, the trial court granted\r\n  the Foundation's motion for summary judgment. Likewise without stated grounds, the\r\n  trial court denied Homeowners' motion for reconsideration. Homeowners appeal.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHomeowners\r\n  argue the trial court erred in failing to set forth findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law in its order. We agree.\r\n\r\n\tIn Bowen\r\n  v. Lee Process Systems Co., this court stated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOn\r\n  appeal from the grant of summary judgment, an appellate court must determine\r\n  whether the trial court's stated grounds for its\r\n  decision are supported by the record. It is our duty to undertake a thorough and meaningful review of the trial court's\r\n  order and the entire record on appeal. Where, as here, the trial court fails to\r\n  articulate the reasons for its action on the record or enter a written order\r\n  outlining its rationale, we\r\n  simply cannot perform our designated function. We therefore hold a trial court's order on summary\r\n  judgment must set out facts and accompanying legal analysis sufficient to\r\n  permit meaningful appellate review.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n342 S.C. 232, 235-37, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 86, 87-88 (Ct. App. 2000) (footnotes omitted). The court in Bowen vacated the order granting summary judgment and remanded &quot;the case to the\r\n  trial court for a written order identifying the facts and accompanying legal\r\n  analysis upon which it relied . . . .&quot; Id. at 241, 536 S.E.2d at\r\n  91; see B&amp;B Liquors, Inc. v. O'Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 271-72,\r\n  603 S.E.2d 629, 631-32 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Bowen, this court vacated\r\n  and remanded for a written order where trial court granted summary judgment by\r\n  using a form order).\r\nThis court has\r\n  distinguished Bowen where the trial court affirmed an order of the\r\n  Workers' Compensation Commission in a form order where the commission's order\r\n  adopted the single commissioner's order. Porter v. Labor Depot, 372 S.C.\r\n  560, 567-68, 643 S.E.2d 96, 100 (Ct. App. 2007) (stating &quot;not all\r\n  situations require a detailed order, and the trial court's form order may be\r\n  sufficient if the appellate court can ascertain the basis for the trial court's\r\n  ruling from the record on appeal&quot;). Likewise, this court distinguished Bowen and addressed the merits where the trial court denied post-trial motions in a\r\n  form order. See Clark v. S.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 353 S.C. 291,\r\n  311-12, 578 S.E.2d 16, 26 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding Bowen distinguishable\r\n  because court's reasoning for denial of post-trial motions could be determined\r\n  from the record on&nbsp; appeal). \r\nHowever,\r\n  this court relied on Bowen and distinguished Clark where the\r\n  trial court summarily denied post-trial motions.Â  Doe v. Howe, 367 S.C.\r\n  432, 447-48, 626 S.E.2d 25, 32-34 (Ct. App. 2005) (vacating and remanding where\r\n  it could not be determined from the record why the trial court rejected the\r\n  movant's post-trial arguments).\r\nWe conclude\r\n  the trial court's reasoning for granting summary judgment in this case is not\r\n  clear from the record.Â  Accordingly, relying on Bowen, we vacate the\r\n  order on appeal and remand for a written order identifying facts and\r\n  accompanying legal analysis.\r\nVACATED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4691","title":"State v.

Celia Robinson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia,\r\n  and Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: In this\r\n  criminal case, Cameron Lavar Brown appeals his convictions and sentences for\r\n  voluntary manslaughter and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime.Â  Brown argues the trial court erred by: (1) refusing to permit\r\n  the jury to view the crime scene; (2) allowing the State to comment on his\r\n  post-arrest silence; (3) admitting evidence that he smoked marijuana on the day\r\n  of the shooting; and (4) refusing a motion for mistrial and continuance.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nÂ  FACTS\r\nRegina Scott (Mother) lived with her husband, Henry Scott (the\r\n  Victim), and her son, Brown, in Charleston.Â  On July 7, 2005, around 9:30 or\r\n  10:00 p.m., Mother was washing her hair in the kitchen sink when Brown came\r\n  into the kitchen and told her something was missing from his room.[2]Â  Mother responded that she would be\r\n  with him as soon as she finished washing her hair.Â  Brown waited for a moment,\r\n  but he left the kitchen before Mother finished washing her hair.Â  She stated\r\n  she then heard some &quot;scuffing around&quot; coming from the second floor of\r\n  the house, and she heard a loud pop while she was trying to finish washing her\r\n  hair.Â  This noise was caused by the Victim and Brown.Â  \r\nInitially, Mother attributed this sound to the television.Â  She\r\n  left the kitchen to investigate and realized the television was not the source\r\n  of the noise.Â  The Victim then approached her and said, &quot;Faye, that boy\r\n  shot me,&quot; and she saw a gunshot wound in the Victim's stomach.Â  The Victim\r\n  was taken to the hospital where he died.Â  \r\nThe day following the shooting, Brown turned himself over to the authorities.Â \r\n  Brown was charged with murder and possession of a firearm during the commission\r\n  of a violent crime.Â  The jury returned a guilty verdict for voluntary\r\n  manslaughter and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\n  crime.Â  The trial court sentenced Brown to eighteen years for the voluntary\r\n  manslaughter conviction and five years for the firearm conviction, with both sentences\r\n  to run concurrently.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The court is bound\r\n  by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â Â \r\n  This court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial court's\r\n  ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrown contends the trial court erred by: (1) refusing\r\n  to permit a jury view of the crime scene; (2) allowing the State to comment on\r\n  his post-arrest silence; (3) admitting evidence that he had smoked marijuana on\r\n  the day of the shooting; and (4) refusing a motion for mistrial and\r\n  continuance.Â  We\r\n  address each issue in turn.\r\nA. Jury View\r\nBrown contends the trial court abused its discretion by refusing\r\n  to permit a jury view of the crime scene because the diagram misled and\r\n  confused the jury regarding the layout of the house; the jury was unable to\r\n  hear what it was like inside the house; the evidence admitted at trial did not\r\n  help the jury appreciate the proximity and the size of the rooms in the house;\r\n  and the evidence failed to depict the stairway and the vestibule where the\r\n  shooting occurred.Â  We disagree.[3]\r\nJury views are controlled by section 14-7-1320 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, which states in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\tThe jury in any case may, at the\r\n  request of either party, be taken to view the place or premises in question or\r\n  any property, matter or thing relating to the controversy between the parties\r\n\twhen\r\n    it appears to the court that such view is necessary to a just decision . .\r\n  . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-7-1320 (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).\r\nA jury view is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 100, 544 S.E.2d 30, 37 (2001).Â  The trial\r\n  court's decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.\r\nDuring Mother's testimony, the State sought to introduce a diagram\r\n  that showed the layout of the home.Â  The State conceded the diagram was not\r\n  drawn to scale, but the purpose of the diagram was to show the locations of\r\n  each of the rooms in the house in relation to each other.Â  Defense counsel\r\n  stated, &quot;I don't object to the Court's ruling, although I would ask the\r\n  Court, if it's going to be introduced, that it give more weight to our request\r\n  for a jury-scene visit, crime scene visit.&quot;Â  The trial court admitted the\r\n  diagram into evidence and denied the jury view request.Â  \r\nThe State and defense counsel, along with several witnesses,\r\n  acknowledged the diagram was not to scale.Â  For example, Mother stated the\r\n  diagram was not drawn to scale, but was an accurate representation of the\r\n  location of the rooms with respect to each other.Â  Officer Heath King agreed\r\n  with the State's contention that the diagram was not drawn to scale, but he stated\r\n  it showed with accuracy the layout of the house.Â  Officer Richard Holmes agreed\r\n  with defense counsel that the diagram was not intended to show the size of the\r\n  rooms, but it was a layout of the house.Â  Officer Rene Charles agreed with the\r\n  State that the diagram was not to scale, but it accurately depicted the layout\r\n  of the house.Â  Based on the foregoing, the jury knew the diagram was not drawn\r\n  to scale but that it correctly portrayed the layout of the house.Â  Thus, the\r\n  jury was not misled or confused regarding the layout of the house. \r\nAs to Brown's contention the jury was unable to hear what it was\r\n  like inside the house, Mother's testimony shed light on the subject.Â  Mother\r\n  stated she heard noise coming from the second floor of the house while she was\r\n  downstairs in the kitchen washing her hair.Â  She also stated she heard the\r\n  Victim come down the stairs.Â  The jury might not have been able to hear the\r\n  acoustic conditions of the house, but from Mother's testimony, it was apparent\r\n  that a person on the first floor could hear what occurred on the second floor. \r\nAdditionally, the evidence admitted at trial showed the proximity\r\n  and the size of the rooms in the house, including the stairway and the\r\n  vestibule where the shooting occurred.Â  Mother stated the house was small, the\r\n  stairway narrow and dark, and described the confines of the house in general.Â Â \r\n  Officer Holmes testified the house &quot;is a confined area.&quot;Â  Officer\r\n  Charles, who took photographs of the crime scene, used these photographs to\r\n  show the location of the Victim when the police arrived.Â  One of these\r\n  photographs showed the stairway.Â  \r\nMoreover, the trial court, in declining the request for a jury\r\n  view, stated:\r\n\r\n\tI was concerned about the\r\n  representations regarding the scale of the drawing.Â  But as we got further in\r\n  the trial, it became very apparent to me that the pictures that have been\r\n  presented of the scene are accurate, they are accurate in scale, and they give\r\n  a very clear impression of the tightness of this abode. . . . [The pictures]\r\n  are incredibly accurate in terms of the scale, of the narrowness of the porch,\r\n  the narrowness of the confines within which this incident took place. . . . If\r\n  they were not, I think there would be some basis for the Court to go to a jury,\r\n  to have a jury view. In this instance I do not think it is necessary, and I\r\n  would find for the record that it is not necessary to a just decision in this\r\n  case. . . . The photographs are accurate and are sufficient to aid the jury in\r\n  their decision making as fact finders of this case, and the Court would deny\r\n  the motion. . . .Â  \r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we cannot conclude the trial court\r\n  improperly denied the jury view request.Â  Id.Â  (holding a jury view is a\r\n  matter within the discretion of the trial court and its decision will not be\r\n  reversed absent an abuse of discretion); Id. at 100-101, 544 S.E.2d at\r\n  37-38 (holding the trial court properly denied a jury view of the crime scene\r\n  in a murder case when the jury requested to view the scene at night due to\r\n  their concern that a witness lacked sufficient lighting to identify the\r\n  defendant because a photograph of the area was admitted into evidence that\r\n  indicated a street light was in the area and the witness testified that he had\r\n  enough light to identify defendant).\r\nB. Post-Arrest\r\n  Silence\r\nBrown next contends the trial court erred by allowing the State to comment on his\r\n  post-arrest silence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, the State called Officer Richard\r\n  Burckhardt to testify.Â  The solicitor asked Officer Burckhardt if Brown\r\n  complained of any injuries after he turned himself into the authorities, and Officer\r\n  Burckhardt replied in the negative.Â  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing\r\n  Burckhardt's testimony constituted a statement against Brown's interest.Â  \r\nBrown\r\n  invoked his Miranda[4] rights immediately after he turned himself over to the\r\n  authorities.Â  Thereafter, Brown was placed in a patrol car and transported to\r\n  the City Police Department where he was formally charged and processed.Â  During\r\n  this time, Officer Burckhardt used a questionnaire to inquire about Brown's\r\n  mental and medical information, including existing medical conditions.[5]Â  \r\nDefense counsel argued Brown invoked his Miranda rights, and any subsequent statements made by Brown would violate his right to\r\n  remain silent.Â  The trial court found Miranda inapplicable because\r\n  Officer Burckhardt's questions were routine administrative questions, and it allowed\r\n  his testimony.Â  On appeal, Brown asserts this decision was erroneous.Â  \r\nThe admission of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court.Â  State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d 442, 443\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The trial court's decision will not be overturned unless\r\n  controlled by an error of law resulting in undue prejudice.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, &quot;No\r\n  person shall be . . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\r\n  himself . . . .&quot;Â  U.S.\r\n  Const. amend. V.Â  Based on this right against self-incrimination, the Supreme\r\n  Court announced, &quot;[T]he prosecution may not use statements,\r\n  whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of\r\n  the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444.Â  \r\nCustodial\r\n  interrogation is &quot;questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after\r\n  a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of\r\n  action in any significant way.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Interrogation is\r\n  defined as express questioning, or its functional equivalent which includes\r\n  words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally\r\n    attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably\r\n  likely to elicit an incriminating response.&quot;Â  State v. Sims, 304\r\n  S.C. 409, 416-17, 405 S.E.2d 377, 381-82 (1991) (internal quotations omitted)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The Miranda warnings do not apply to routine booking\r\n  questions.Â  State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 49, 282 S.E.2d 838, 846\r\n  (1981) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Gilchrist, 342 S.C. 369,\r\n  536 S.E.2d 868 (2000)).\r\nIn\r\n  response to the question, &quot;[A]re there any current physical conditions\r\n  that we would need to know about, meaning serious things of any serious nature\r\n  that would need treatment,&quot; Brown referred to a heart condition he\r\n  suffered during the 1990s, but said he had no current problems.Â  The question posed\r\n  was a routine booking question.Â  As Officer Burckhardt explained, he used this\r\n  questionnaire on all inmates as part of the booking process.Â  Officer\r\n  Burckhardt testified that the purpose of the questions was to determine whether\r\n  an inmate was fit to be incarcerated or needed to be taken to a medical\r\n  facility to receive medical attention.Â  We find no reversible error in the\r\n  trial court's ruling. \r\nC. Marijuana\r\n  Use\r\nBrown\r\n  argues the trial court erred by admitting evidence indicating he had smoked\r\n  marijuana on the day of the shooting because it was improper character evidence\r\n  and inadmissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs noted above, the\r\n  admission of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and the\r\n  trial court's decision will not be overturned unless it is controlled by an\r\n  error of law resulting in undue prejudice.Â  Johnson, 318 S.C. at 196,\r\n  456 S.E.2d at 443.Â  &quot;The mere asking of an improper question is not\r\n  necessarily prejudicial, however, where no evidence is introduced as a result.&quot;Â  State v. Benning, 338 S.C. 59, 63, 524 S.E.2d 852, 855 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\nThe solicitor asked Brown if he had used any drugs prior to the\r\n  shooting, to which Brown replied in the negative.Â  The solicitor asked Brown\r\n  whether he remembered speaking to a nurse and telling her that he had smoked\r\n  marijuana on the day of the shooting.Â  Brown replied, &quot;No, sir, I don't\r\n  remember that.&quot;Â  \r\nEven if we assume that the solicitor's questions were improper,\r\n  the State did not introduce evidence to show Brown had used marijuana on the\r\n  day of the shooting.Â  In fact, Brown denied using marijuana on the day of the\r\n  shooting.Â  Thus, Brown suffered no prejudice as a result of the solicitor's\r\n  questions.Â  \r\nD. Mistrial\r\n  and Motion for a Continuance\r\nBrown argues the trial court erred by refusing his motion\r\n  for mistrial and continuance.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. White, 371\r\n  S.C. 439, 443-44, 639 S.E.2d 160, 162-63 (Ct. App. 2006).Â Â  The trial court's\r\n  decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion\r\n  amounting to an error of law.Â  Id.Â  South Carolina courts favor the\r\n  exercise of wide discretion of the trial\r\n  court in determining the merits of such a motion in each individual case.Â  Id.Â  It is only in cases where there is an abuse of discretion resulting in\r\n  prejudice to the defendant that we will intervene and grant a new trial.Â  Id.Â  \r\nA manifest necessity must exist for the trial court to discharge\r\n  the jury and declare a mistrial.Â  Id.Â  However, the trial court is left\r\n  to determine, in its discretion, whether, under all the circumstances of each\r\n  case, such necessity exists.Â  Id.Â  The mistrial should be granted only\r\n  if there is a manifest necessity or the ends of public justice are served.Â  Id.Â  The trial court should first exhaust other methods to cure possible prejudice\r\n  before declaring a mistrial.Â  Id.\r\nSimilarly, the trial court's decision to deny a motion for\r\n  continuance is a matter within the trial court's discretion.Â  State v.\r\n    Lytchfield, 230 S.C. 405, 409, 95 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1957).Â  As such, this\r\n  court will not reverse the trial court unless there was an abuse of discretion that\r\n  resulted in prejudice.Â  Id.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the trial, the State called Sergeant Michael Gordon to testify.Â  Sergeant\r\n  Gordon stated he was contacted by Oscar Douglas.Â  Douglas was working for\r\n  defense counsel as a private investigator.Â  Douglas had received a shell casing\r\n  recovered by Mother as she was cleaning her house a few days after the\r\n  shooting.Â  Douglas met Gordon and turned over this evidence.Â  \r\nA\r\n  day after this meeting, Gordon contacted Mother regarding the shell casing.Â  Gordon\r\n  stated Mother told him that defense counsel represented the family, and that\r\n  she would not give a statement.Â  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the\r\n  grounds that the testimony indicated he represented the family, and the\r\n  representation that Mother would not cooperate with the police was untrue and\r\n  highly prejudicial to Brown.Â  Defense counsel argued he would need to subpoena\r\n  Douglas to disprove Gordon's statement.Â  Douglas was in Iraq, and counsel asked\r\n  for a continuance in order to subpoena Douglas.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  mistrial motion and the motion for a continuance.Â  \r\nInitially, we question whether this issue is preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  After making the motions for a mistrial and a continuance, the State\r\n  and defense counsel came to a compromise regarding Gordon's testimony.Â  The\r\n  parties agreed they would stipulate that defense counsel only represented\r\n  Brown, and defense counsel did not instruct Mother not to cooperate.Â  The\r\n  parties successfully petitioned the court to instruct the jury that a\r\n  stipulation is an agreement which requires no further proof.Â  Counsel got the\r\n  relief asked for and cannot complain on appeal.Â  State v. Sinclair, 275\r\n  S.C. 608, 610, 274 S.E.2d 411, 412 (1981) (holding where the defendant had\r\n  received the relief requested from the trial court, there is no issue for the\r\n  appellate court to decide). Additionally, there is a second ground on which to\r\n  conclude this issue is unpreserved. \r\nIf a trial court issues a curative instruction, a party must make\r\n  a contemporaneous objection to the sufficiency of the curative instruction to\r\n  preserve an alleged error for review.Â  State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310,\r\n  316, 479 S.E.2d 517, 520 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding no issue is preserved for\r\n  appellate review if the complaining party accepts the judge's ruling and does\r\n  not contemporaneously make an additional objection to the sufficiency of the\r\n  curative charge).Â  In the present case, the trial court issued a curative\r\n  instruction and defense counsel failed to challenge the sufficiency of the\r\n  curative instruction, making this issue unpreserved for review.Â  \r\nFurthermore, even if this issue were preserved, we believe the\r\n  trial court's instruction to the jury cured any error.Â  A curative instruction\r\n  is usually deemed to cure an alleged error.Â  Id.Â  The trial court\r\n  instructed the jury to:\r\n\r\n\t[D]isregard the last question and\r\n  last answer, asked of the witness in its entirety.Â  You are to give absolutely\r\n  no consideration to the question or the answer.Â  It is not to be discussed in\r\n  any way during your deliberation.Â  You are to completely disregard it, and you\r\n  are to completely disabuse your mind of it.Â  And I am instructing your\r\n  foreperson that if it is discussed in any way during deliberations, it is to be\r\n  reported to the Court immediately.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court's curative instruction cured any error presented\r\n  by Gordon's testimony because the jury was told to disregard that testimony\r\n  completely.Â  Based on the foregoing, the trial court did not commit reversible\r\n  error. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Brown testified he kept the earnings from his job in\r\n  his room, and his money was missing.Â  \r\n[3] The State argues this issue\r\n  is not preserved for review.Â  We disagree.Â  Defense counsel asked for a jury\r\n  view, and the trial court denied this request.Â  This issue was raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court and is properly before this court.Â  Wilder\r\n    Corp. v.

Shupe,\r\n  Assistant Attorney General William M. Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: The State commenced an action pursuant to\r\n  the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act[1] (the Act), alleging Bobbie Manigo met the statutory criteria for confinement as a sexually\r\n  violent predator (SVP).Â  Based on the Act, the State sought Manigo's commitment in a secure facility for long-term care, control,\r\n  and treatment. The jury found Manigo was an SVP, and the trial court issued an\r\n  order committing Manigo to the Department of Mental Health for long-term care\r\n  and treatment.Â  Manigo argues the trial court erroneously: (1) denied his\r\n  motion for summary judgment; (2) allowed hearsay testimony; and (3) limited the\r\n  number of witnesses he could call.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nÂ  FACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1987, Manigo was convicted of assault and battery of a high and aggravated\r\n  nature for making sexual remarks while touching the victim.Â  Manigo made sexual\r\n  remarks to the victim, touched her on her breasts and vagina, and pushed her to\r\n  the ground and attempted to have sex with her.Â  Manigo was sentenced to ten\r\n  years' imprisonment, suspended on the service of two years and five years'\r\n  probation.Â  In 1990, while on probation for the 1987 offense, Manigo was\r\n  indicted for assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the first\r\n  degree.Â  Manigo used a knife and physical force to sexually assault the\r\n  victim.Â  Manigo pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual\r\n  conduct in the second degree.Â  Manigo was sentenced to twenty years'\r\n  imprisonment.Â  In 2004, the State unsuccessfully sought to classify Manigo as an\r\n  SVP, and Manigo was released from prison.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2006, Manigo followed the victim, masturbated, and urinated in front of her,\r\n  and repeatedly exposed himself.Â  Manigo pled guilty to indecent exposure.Â  He\r\n  was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, suspended upon the service of nine\r\n  months and two years' probation.Â  The State sought to classify Manigo as an SVP.Â \r\n  The case went to trial, and a jury found Manigo to be an SVP.Â  The trial court\r\n  issued an order for commitment, committing Manigo to the Department of Mental\r\n  Health for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Act provides for the involuntary civil commitment of SVPs who are mentally\r\n  abnormal and extremely dangerous.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp. 2009).Â  In\r\n  order to commit an individual under the Act, a series of steps must occur.Â  White\r\n    v. State, 375 S.C. 1, 6-7, 649 S.E.2d 172, 174-75 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  Initially, the multidisciplinary team, appointed by the Director of the\r\n  Department of Corrections, must determine if the person meets the definition of\r\n  an SVP.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the multidisciplinary team finds the person meets this definition, then it\r\n  refers the case to the prosecutor's review committee.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  prosecutor's review committee must determine whether probable cause exists to\r\n  commit the person as an SVP.Â  Id.Â  If this committee determines probable\r\n  cause is present, the Attorney General may file a petition in the circuit court\r\n  to request a probable cause hearing.Â  Id.\r\nAt\r\n  the probable cause hearing, the trial court must determine if there is probable\r\n  cause to believe the person is an SVP.Â  Id.Â  If the trial court\r\n  concludes there is probable cause, the person is transferred to a secure\r\n  facility for evaluation by a court-approved qualified expert.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Ultimately, a trial must be conducted, at which the State must convince the\r\n  court or jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is an SVP.Â  Id.\r\nA. Summary Judgment \r\nManigo\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his summary judgment motion.Â \r\n  Specifically, Manigo argues the Act is triggered only if a person is currently\r\n  serving a sentence for a sexually violent offense, and because his 2006 offense\r\n  of indecent exposure does not qualify as a sexually violent offense, the trial\r\n  court lacked jurisdiction to commit him.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen reviewing a summary judgment motion, the facts and\r\n  circumstances must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Laurens Emergency Med.\r\n    Specialist, P.A. v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104,\r\n  108-09, 584 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2003).Â  A summary judgment motion should be granted when it is clear there is no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  SVP is &quot;a person who: (1) has been convicted of a sexually violent\r\n  offense; and (2) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that\r\n  makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in\r\n  a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).Â  Section\r\n  44-48-40 sets out when a person is to be referred to the multidisciplinary team to determine if the person meets the definition of an SVP.Â  This section states\r\n  the multidisciplinary team is to be notified &quot;when\r\n  a person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-40 (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added). \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to determine and\r\n  give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Wade v. State, 348\r\n  S.C. 255, 259, 559 S.E.2d 843, 844 (2002).Â  The best evidence of\r\n  legislative intent is the text of the statute.Â  Id.Â  If\r\n  the\r\n  terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to\r\n  their literal meaning.Â  Id.Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  parties agree that Manigo's conviction for assault with intent to commit\r\n  criminal sexual conduct is a sexually violent crime.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 44-48-30 (Supp. 2009) (stating assault with intent\r\n  to commit criminal sexual conduct qualifies as a sexually violent offense).Â  The\r\n  Act only requires that a person &quot;has been convicted of a sexually violent\r\n  offense.&quot;Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-30(1) and 44-48-40 (Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  Neither section requires the person to be currently serving an active sentence\r\n  for a sexually violent offense.Â  The statutes do not use present tense language,\r\n  rather they state if the person has committed such an offense and meets the\r\n  other qualifications set out in sections 44-48-30 and 44-48-40, then the person\r\n  should be referred to the multidisciplinary team.Â  The Act is unambiguous, and\r\n  we must give meaning to its terms.Â  See City\r\n    of Columbia v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of S.C., 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 (stating if the\r\n  language in the statute is plain and unambiguous, there is no need to resort to\r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation and the court must apply those terms\r\n  according to their literal meaning).[2]\r\nIf\r\n  the statutes used present tense language, then our interpretation would be\r\n  different.Â  The case of Townes v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 609 S.E.2d 1\r\n  (Va. 2005), which interpreted Virginia's Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA),\r\n  is instructive on this point.Â  In that case, Townes was convicted of statutory\r\n  rape in 1973, and this offense qualified as a sexually violent offense for the\r\n  determination of whether a person is an SVP.Â  Townes, 609 S.E.2d at 2.Â  In\r\n  1991, Townes completed serving his sentence for the statutory rape conviction.Â  Id.Â  However, Townes had committed offenses, none of which were sexually\r\n  violent, while he was in prison, and as a result, he did not get released on\r\n  parole until 2002.Â  Id.Â  Shortly after his release, Townes was returned\r\n  to prison for violating his parole.Â  Id.\r\nFour\r\n  months before his scheduled release, the Director of the Virginia Department of\r\n  Corrections notified the Commitment Review Committee that Townes was subject to\r\n  review for civil commitment because he had committed a sexually violent offense\r\n  and had been identified as being likely to reoffend.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  Commitment Review Committee completed its review of Townes' case and forwarded\r\n  to the Attorney General of Virginia a recommendation that Townes be committed\r\n  as an SVP.Â  Id.\r\nThe Commonwealth of\r\n  Virginia filed a petition with the trial court for the civil commitment of\r\n  Townes.Â  Id.Â  The trial court conducted a probable cause hearing, held\r\n  there was probable cause to believe that Townes was an SVP, and ordered that\r\n  Townes remain in custody until a full hearing could be conducted.Â  Id.Â  Townes'\r\n  counsel filed a motion and argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction because\r\n  Townes had completed his sentence for the 1973 statutory rape conviction, and\r\n  he was not incarcerated for a predicate sexually violent offense at the time of\r\n  the petition.Â  Id.Â  The trial court ruled that although Townes had\r\n  completed his sentence for the statutory rape conviction, he was subject to\r\n  commitment as an SVP because he remained incarcerated on another offense.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Ultimately, the trial court found Townes to be an SVP and ordered him to be\r\n  committed to the custody of Virginia's Department of Mental Health, Mental\r\n  Retardation and Substance Abuse Services.Â  Id.Â  at 2-3.Â Â Â  \r\nOn appeal to the\r\n  Virginia Supreme Court, Townes argued the trial court erred in finding he\r\n  remained subject to the SVPA, despite the fact that he had completed serving\r\n  his sentence for the statutory rape conviction, which served as the sexually\r\n  violent offense.Â  Id.Â  The Commonwealth argued the statutes in question\r\n  did not specifically require the prisoner to be currently serving a sentence\r\n  for the sexually violent offense, only that a person be in prison and have been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offense.Â  Id.Â  The Virginia Supreme\r\n  Court began by looking at the statutes in question.Â  Id.Â  The court\r\n  stated: Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\tIn relevant part, Code Â§ 37.1-70.4\r\n  provides: \r\n\tB. The Director of the Department of\r\n  Corrections shall establish and maintain a database of prisoners in his custody\r\n\twho are incarcerated for sexually violent offenses. \r\n\tC. Each month, the Director shall\r\n  review the database of prisoners incarcerated for sexually violent offenses and identify all such prisoners who are scheduled for release from prison\r\n  within 10 months from the date of such review who receive a score of four or\r\n  more on the Rapid Risk Assessment for Sexual Offender Recidivism or a like\r\n  score on a comparable, scientifically validated instrument as designated by the Commissioner. Upon the\r\n  identification of such prisoners, the Director shall forward their name, their\r\n  scheduled date of release, and a copy of their file to the [Commitment Review\r\n  Committee] for assessment.\r\n\tCode Â§ 37.1-70.5 provides:\r\n\tWithin 90 days of receiving notice\r\n  from the Director pursuant to Â§ 37.1-70.4\r\n  regarding a prisoner who is incarcerated for a sexually violent offense, the [Commitment Review Committee] shall\r\n  (i) complete its assessment of such prisoner for possible commitment pursuant\r\n  to subsection B and (ii) forward its recommendation regarding the prisoner, in\r\n  written form, to the Attorney General pursuant to subsection C.\r\n\r\nId.Â  at 3 (emphasis in original).\r\nThe\r\n  Virginia Supreme Court did not agree with the Commonwealth's argument that the\r\n  language of these statutes did not limit the application of the SVPA to those\r\n  prisoners who are currently serving a sentence for a sexually violent offense\r\n  because such an interpretation would &quot;ignore the present tense of that\r\n  language.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Rather, the Virginia high court reasoned that\r\n  following the Commonwealth's interpretation &quot;would require us to add\r\n  language and broaden the scope of the act by applying it to prisoners 'who are\r\n  or previously have been incarcerated for sexually violent offenses.'&quot;Â  Id. at 4. \r\nThe\r\n  Virginia statutes use present tense language; however, the South Carolina\r\n  statutes do not.Â  Namely, section 44-48-40 states the multidisciplinary team is to be notified &quot;when\r\n  a person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-40 (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).Â  As it relates\r\n  to this case, our statute is different from Virginia's in this one critical\r\n  aspect.[3]Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the legislative intent supports our conclusion that the Act only requires that\r\n  a person be convicted of a sexually violent offense to trigger the process of\r\n  commitment.Â  Section 44-48-20 states: \r\n\r\n\tThe General Assembly finds that a\r\n  mentally abnormal and extremely dangerous group of [SVPs] exists who require\r\n  involuntary civil commitment in a secure facility for long-term control, care,\r\n  and treatment.Â  The General Assembly further finds that the likelihood these [SVPs]\r\n  will engage in repeated acts of sexual violence if not treated for their mental\r\n  conditions is significant.Â  Because the existing civil commitment process is\r\n  inadequate to address the special needs of [SVPs] and the risks that they\r\n  present to society, the General Assembly has determined that a separate,\r\n  involuntary civil commitment process for the long-term control, care, and\r\n  treatment of [SVPs] is necessary.Â  The General Assembly also determines that,\r\n  because of the nature of the mental conditions from which [SVPs] suffer and the\r\n  dangers they present, it is necessary to house involuntarily-committed [SVPs]\r\n  in secure facilities separate from persons involuntarily committed under\r\n  traditional civil commitment statutes.Â  The civil commitment of [SVPs] is not\r\n  intended to stigmatize the mentally ill community.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann Â§\r\n  44-48-20 (Supp. 2009).\r\nThe foregoing clearly demonstrates our Legislature's intent to\r\n  identify and provide treatment to SVPs to protect the people of South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Our Legislature's intent in enacting the Act was to provide\r\n  treatment through involuntary commitment to individuals who suffer from a\r\n  mental abnormality to prevent such persons from committing future acts of sexual\r\n  violence.Â  See Wade, 348\r\n  S.C. at 259, 559 S.E.2d at 844 (holding the cardinal rule of\r\n  statutory construction is to determine and give effect to the intent of the\r\n  legislature).Â  \r\nB. Hearsay\r\n  Testimony\r\nManigo argues the trial court improperly allowed hearsay\r\n  testimony.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Pam Crawford, the forensic psychiatrist who evaluated Manigo, testified about what\r\n  she learned from Dr. Burke, Manigo's sex offender treatment provider.Â  The\r\n  following colloquy took place between the State's attorney and Dr. Crawford:\r\n\r\n\tQ: Now, is it important when taking\r\n  sex offender treatment to admit to the sex offense provider all of your\r\n  offense?\r\n\tA: I think it is. \r\n\tQ: Do you understand that [Manigo]\r\n  did that?\r\n\tA: What I learned from [Dr. Burke]\r\n  was that [Manigo] did not tell Dr. Burke about his prior sex offenses, so Dr.\r\n  Burke was not aware of the proper pleas, but was only aware of the indecent\r\n  exposure.Â  \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ:Â  Was that information a part of the basis for your opinion\r\n  in this case? \r\n\tA:Â  Yes. \r\n\r\nManigo\r\n  objected to this testimony and argued it was hearsay.Â  The trial court\r\n  overruled the objection.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 577, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007).Â  To constitute\r\n  an abuse of discretion, the conclusions of the trial judge must lack\r\n  evidentiary support or be controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  The admissibility of an expert's testimony\r\n  is within the trial judge's sound discretion, whose decision will not be\r\n  reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Hundley ex\r\n    rel. Hundley v. Rite Aid of S.C., Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 294, 529 S.E.2d 45, 50 (Ct.

Fraley, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4693\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2010 â€“ Filed June 2,\r\n  2010Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tChristopher Paul Thompson and David\r\n  Michael Collins, Jr., both of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRichard H. Rhodes and Ruth L. Cate, both of\r\n  Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In\r\n  this appeal, Donald R. (Husband) contends the family court erred by (1)\r\n  requiring Husband to pay Susan R.'s (Wife) premarital medical expenses and\r\n  costs; (2) imputing additional income to Husband; and (3) awarding attorneys'\r\n  fees to Wife.Â  We affirm as modified.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 22, 2006, Wife filed for divorce on the\r\n  grounds of Husband's adultery and habitual drunkenness.Â  In Wife's complaint,\r\n  she sought, inter alia, custody of the parties' children, child support,\r\n  contribution for their children's uncovered medical expenses, equitable\r\n  distribution of the parties' assets and debts, alimony, restraining orders, and\r\n  attorneys' fees.Â  Husband counterclaimed, seeking a decree of separate\r\n  maintenance and support and requesting custody, child support, contribution for\r\n  their children's uncovered medical expenses, equitable division of their assets\r\n  and debts, restraining orders, and attorneys' fees.Â  \r\nThe majority of Husband's and Wife's claims were\r\n  resolved in the parties' settlement agreement, which the family court approved\r\n  at the final hearing.Â  During the final hearing on May 5 and 6, 2007, the\r\n  family court heard testimony regarding several outstanding issues not agreed\r\n  upon by Husband and Wife, namely the parties' income for purposes of computing\r\n  child support, responsibility for payment of Wife's medical bills, and\r\n  attorneys' fees.Â  \r\nIn its subsequent divorce decree dated June 7, 2008,\r\n  the family court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant\r\n  to this appeal: (1) Husband and Wife married on May 24, 2004, in Spartanburg\r\n  County; (2) the parties had two children together, one child being born during\r\n  the marriage and the other child being born prior to the marriage; (3) several\r\n  witnesses, including two of Husband's paramours, admitted to engaging in an adulterous\r\n  relationship with Husband, thus entitling Wife to a divorce on the grounds of\r\n  adultery; (4) Wife waived her claim for alimony; (5) for purposes of child\r\n  support, Husband's gross monthly income from his employment with Mitsubishi\r\n  Polyester Film was $4,651.66, which included $100 per month in proceeds from a\r\n  rental property and $400 per month from Husband's part-time farrier business;\r\n  (6) Wife's gross monthly income as a nurse was $2,849.41; (7) the $18,542.13 in\r\n  debt for Wife's surgery at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center was a result of\r\n  Wife's miscarriage; thus, it was a marital debt, despite being incurred prior\r\n  to the parties' marriage; and (8) Husband was responsible for paying half of\r\n  Wife's attorneys' fees.Â  \r\nHusband timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion,\r\n  arguing the family court erred in its award of attorneys' fees, imputation of\r\n  additional income to Husband, and requirement for supervised visitation with\r\n  the parties' children.Â  The family court denied Husband's Rule 59(e) motion.[2]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court order, this court has\r\n  authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C.\r\n  471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When reviewing decisions of the family\r\n  court, we are cognizant that the family court had the opportunity to see the\r\n  witnesses, hear &quot;the testimony delivered from the stand, and had the\r\n  benefit of that personal observance of and contact with the parties which is of\r\n  peculiar value in arriving at a correct result in a case of this\r\n  character.&quot;Â  DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329,\r\n  331 (1972). \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nHusband claims the family court erred by (1) requiring Husband to pay Wife's premarital medical\r\n  expenses and costs; (2) imputing additional income to Husband for purposes of\r\n  child support; and (3) requiring Husband to pay $13,000 of Wife's attorneys'\r\n  fees.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Wife's Medical Expenses\r\nHusband contends the family court lacked jurisdiction\r\n  to order Husband to pay a portion of Wife's medical bills because the surgery\r\n  occurred prior to the parties' marriage; thus, it was a nonmarital debt.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nThe family court found Wife's medical bill from\r\n  Spartanburg Regional Medical Center for $18,542.13 was a marital debt because\r\n  although the surgery occurred prior to the parties' marriage, it related to the\r\n  miscarriage of Husband and Wife's child.Â  Therefore, it was a shared expense of\r\n  the parties.Â  While we agree with the family court's decision to require\r\n  Husband to contribute towards the repayment of this debt, we modify the family\r\n  court's classification of this debt as marital because the surgery occurred\r\n  prior to the parties' marriage.Â  See Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  532, 546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13)\r\n  (Supp. 2004) (currently S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(13) (Supp. 2009)) (stating\r\n  marital debts include, among other things, &quot;any other existing debts\r\n  incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the\r\n  marriage&quot;). \r\nDespite the acquisition of this debt prior to the\r\n  parties' marriage, we find this debt would not have occurred but for Husband\r\n  and Wife's relationship, which merits Husband's participation in its\r\n  repayment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-5-60 (Supp. 2007) (&quot;A husband\r\n  shall not be liable for the debts of his wife contracted prior to or after\r\n  their marriage, except for her necessary support and that of their minor\r\n  children residing with her.&quot;); see also Richland Mem. Hosp. v.\r\n    Burton, 282 S.C. 159, 160-61, 318 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1984) (reaffirming common law\r\n  doctrine requiring a husband to be responsible for necessary debts incurred by\r\n  a wife prior to and during marriage and holding a hospital could initiate a\r\n  collection action against husband for medical services rendered to deceased\r\n  wife based on this doctrine).Â  \r\nFurthermore, the family court has jurisdiction &quot;to\r\n  include in the requirements of an order for support the providing of necessary\r\n  shelter, food, clothing, care, medical attention, expenses of confinement,\r\n    both before and after [] birth, . . . and other proper and reasonable expenses\r\n  . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(15) (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).Â \r\n  Section 63-3-530(15) grants the family court exclusive jurisdiction to include\r\n  in any support order a provision for payment of medical expenses and hospital\r\n  bills that are attendant to childbirth.Â  Regardless of whether Husband and Wife\r\n  were married on the date of the surgery, Wife's hospital bill was a direct\r\n  result of her pregnancy and ensuing miscarriage,[3] and the procedure was necessary to Wife's health.Â  Not requiring Husband to\r\n  share in the responsibility for defraying this expense would thwart the\r\n  ultimate goal of ensuring a just, equitable, and fair outcome to both parties.Â \r\n  Thus, we conclude the family court had jurisdiction, and consequently the\r\n  authority, to order Husband to pay half of Wife's hospital bill.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Imputing Income to Husband\r\nNext, Husband claims Wife presented insufficient\r\n  evidence regarding Husband's farrier business and rental property to justify\r\n  the family court's decision to impute additional income to Husband for purposes\r\n  of calculating his child support obligations.Â  We disagree. \r\nChild support awards are within the family court's sound\r\n  discretion and, absent an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.\r\n  Â Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984). Â An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the family court's decision is controlled by\r\n  some error of law or when the order, based upon the findings of fact, is\r\n  without evidentiary support. Â Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477\r\n  S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996). Â \r\nGenerally, the family court determines gross income\r\n  for purposes of calculating child support based upon the financial declarations\r\n  submitted by the parties. Â S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(6) (Supp. 2009). Â &quot;Gross\r\n  income includes income from any source including salaries, wages, commissions,\r\n  royalties, bonuses, [and] rents (less allowable business expenses) . . . .&quot;\r\n  Â S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(2) (Supp. 2009).Â  Additionally,\r\n  &quot;[u]nreported cas[h] income should also be included if it can be\r\n  identified.&quot;Â  Id.Â  When income reflected on the financial\r\n  declaration is at issue, the family court may rely on suitable documentation to\r\n  verify income, such as pay stubs, employer statements, receipts, or expenses\r\n  covering at least one month. Â Regs. 114-4720(A)(6).\r\nWe note neither Husband's 2006 financial declaration\r\n  nor his 2007 income tax return reflected any income from his farrier business\r\n  or rental property.Â  As a result, it was proper for the family court to\r\n  consider invoices from Husband's farrier business for purposes of calculating\r\n  his child support obligation.Â  At the final hearing, Wife introduced invoices\r\n  from 2004 until 2006 that documented Husband's yearly and monthly income from\r\n  his farrier business.Â  Wife testified Husband charged between $75 and $135 per\r\n  horse and shoed horses almost every day of the week.Â  Husband did not contest\r\n  the validity of the invoices Wife submitted, but he stated he typically charged\r\n  $50 per horse, which netted him approximately $110 every two weeks based on his\r\n  current workload. Â Husband also discussed the ordinary and necessary expenses\r\n  he incurred as part of running his farrier business during his testimony.Â  In\r\n  explaining the large discrepancies between his current earnings and past\r\n  profits, Husband stated his income from the farrier business had decreased\r\n  because he was spending more time with his son, and the increased cost of gas\r\n  prevented him from shoeing as many horses as he had in the past.Â  \r\nIn regards to Husband's rental property, Husband\r\n  stated he had not rented his mobile home in more than two years, but when he\r\n  did rent it, he was charging $450 per month in rent and was splitting the\r\n  proceeds with his father who owns the land.[4]Â \r\n  Husband contended, however, that he was unable to currently rent the property\r\n  because it needed &quot;a lot of work to get it where it can be rented.&quot;Â \r\n  Wife also stated Husband rented out the mobile home for between $400 and $475\r\n  per month when she filed for divorce, but it was unoccupied on the date of the\r\n  final hearing, despite Husband's ability to rent it.Â  Husband estimated it cost\r\n  him approximately $100 per month to maintain the mobile home and surrounding\r\n  property.Â  \r\nAfter considering the parties' testimony and the\r\n  submitted invoices, the family court concluded Husband earned $921.75 per month\r\n  in 2004,[5] $1,459.33 per month in 2005, and $1,578.50 per month in 2006.Â  In its decision\r\n  to impute additional income to Husband, the family court acknowledged the\r\n  parties' conflicting testimony and determined Husband should be attributed an\r\n  additional $400 per month from his farrier business and $100 per month for his\r\n  rental property.Â  \r\nBased on the evidence adduced at the final hearing,\r\n  the family court did not abuse its discretion in determining Husband's gross\r\n  income.Â  The documented monthly income from Husband's farrier business was far\r\n  greater than the $400 actually imputed to Husband, which demonstrates the\r\n  family court took Husband's expenses and varied workload into consideration in\r\n  its decision.Â  Furthermore, Husband failed to account for this income in either\r\n  his financial declaration or his most recent tax return. As a result, the\r\n  family court did not err in relying on these invoices as they were the most\r\n  reliable source for computing Husband's gross income.Â  See Regs.\r\n  114-4720(A)(6); see also Spreeuw v. Barker, 385 S.C. 45, 66-67,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 843, 853-54 (Ct. App. 2009) (upholding family court's decision to\r\n  deviate from the father's most recent financial declaration in imputing\r\n  additional income to the father for child support purposes where financial\r\n  declaration understated father's gross income).Â  \r\nAs to the $100 attributed to Husband from his rental\r\n  property, both Husband and Wife stated Husband had rented the mobile home in\r\n  the past for approximately $450 per month.Â  While Husband and Wife differed on\r\n  whether the mobile home was currently suitable for rental purposes, Husband\r\n  conceded that he had a tenant one month prior to Wife filing for divorce and that\r\n  he lived in the mobile home during the pendency of the marital litigation.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Husband's own testimony indicates he actually earned $250 per\r\n  month from the rental property after taking into consideration deductions for\r\n  maintenance and use of the surrounding property.[6]Â \r\n  Because the family court has the authority to include rent for purposes of\r\n  calculating gross income, we discern no error in the family court's decision to\r\n  impute this amount to Husband.Â  See Regs. 114-4720(A)(2) (&quot;Gross\r\n  income includes income from any source including . . . rents (less allowable\r\n  business expenses) . . . .&quot;).Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorneys' Fees\r\nLast, Husband argues Wife was not entitled to\r\n  attorneys' fees.Â  In the alternative, Husband contends the family court's award\r\n  of attorneys' fees was unreasonable and excessive pursuant to Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).Â  \r\n&quot;An award of attorneys' fees and costs is a\r\n  discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial\r\n  court.&quot; Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748\r\n  (1989). Â In order to award attorneys' fees, a court should consider several\r\n  factors including: (1) ability of the party to pay the fees; (2) beneficial\r\n  results obtained; (3) financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect a\r\n  fee award will have on the party's standard of living. Â E.D.M., 307 S.C.\r\n  at 476-77, 415 S.E.2d at 816.Â  In determining the amount of attorneys' fees,\r\n  the family court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the\r\n  services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, the professional\r\n  standing of counsel, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results\r\n  obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. Â Glasscock,\r\n  304 S.C. at 161, 403 S.E.2d at 315.\r\nAt the final hearing, Wife's attorney submitted a fee\r\n  affidavit documenting fees of $26,155.15.Â  Husband did not object to the\r\n  affidavit or attempt to cross-examine Wife or her attorney on any portion of\r\n  the affidavit at the final hearing.Â  Citing to Glasscock in its final\r\n  order, the family court required Husband to pay $13,000 of Wife's attorneys'\r\n  fees because the results were beneficial, the fee was reasonable, Husband was\r\n  at fault, and he had the ability to contribute.Â  \r\nHusband first claims Wife is not entitled to\r\n  attorneys' fees because he successfully defended against some of Wife's\r\n  claims.Â  Even though Husband may have prevailed on some issues, Wife obtained\r\n  beneficial results regarding child custody, child support, Husband's adultery,\r\n  and her entitlement to a portion of Husband's pension and 401(k) plan.Â  See Golden v. Gallardo, 295 S.C. 393, 395, 368 S.E.2d 684, 685 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (finding the family court properly awarded the mother a portion of her\r\n  fees and costs in suit brought by father to enforce visitation rights when both\r\n  parties prevailed on some issues).Â  Husband is correct in his contention that\r\n  his fault in causing the break-up of the marriage should not be a factor in\r\n  awarding attorneys' fees.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 219, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 51, 58 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;A party's fault in causing a divorce . . .\r\n  is not a factor to be considered when awarding attorney's fees.&quot;).Â \r\n  Regardless of Husband's adultery, it is evident from the record Husband has a\r\n  greater ability to pay the fees based on his superior income, which necessarily\r\n  affects his ability to pay the award and the effect of the award on his\r\n  standard of living.Â  Taking these factors into consideration, we do not find\r\n  the family court erred in ordering Husband to contribute towards Wife's\r\n  attorneys' fees.Â  \r\nRegarding Husband's argument on the reasonableness of Wife's\r\n  fees, we do not believe the amount awarded by the family court was excessive.Â \r\n  We note the family court did not make specific findings on all six factors from Glasscock in its order as it is required to do pursuant to Rule 26(a),\r\n  SCFCR.Â  See Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998) (remanding issue of attorneys' fees because\r\n  of family court's failure to set forth specific findings of fact on each of the\r\n  six required factors to be considered in determining the amount of the fees\r\n  pursuant to Glasscock).Â  Specifically, Rule 26(a) directs: &quot;An\r\n  order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case\r\n  shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support\r\n  the court's decision.&quot;\r\nHowever, we find the record is sufficient to affirm\r\n  the fees award based on the family court's order and Wife's affidavits\r\n  concerning costs and fees.Â  See Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522,\r\n  524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991) (stating that when an order from the family\r\n  court is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), SCRFC, the appellate\r\n  court &quot;may remand the matter to the trial court or, where the record is\r\n  sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence&quot;). Â The family court\r\n  enumerated four of the six factors from Glasscock, and Wife's counsel's\r\n  affidavit demonstrates her fees and hours were reasonable in light of the\r\n  length of the litigation and her experience and professional standing within\r\n  the legal community.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the reasonableness of Wife's fees\r\n  based on our review of the record.Â  \r\nHusband also takes specific issue with certain fees\r\n  assessed for time that Wife's counsel billed relating to a rule to show cause\r\n  hearing and a separate DSS action.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review\r\n  because Husband did not object to the affidavit or attempt to cross-examine\r\n  Wife's attorney on those issues at the final hearing.Â  See King v.\r\n    King, 384 S.C. 134, 145, 681 S.E.2d 609, 615 (Ct. App. 2009) (noting\r\n  husband's objection to Wife's affidavit documenting her attorney's fees was\r\n  untimely because he never objected or attempted to cross-examine Wife's counsel\r\n  on the affidavit at the final hearing).Â  Furthermore, while Husband generally contested\r\n  the attorneys' fees award in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion on the grounds the\r\n  award was excessive, he failed to specifically object to the propriety of\r\n  including these fees at the final hearing.Â  See Hickman v. Hickman,\r\n  301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 48, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (&quot;A party cannot use Rule\r\n  59(e) to present to the court an issue the\r\n  party could have raised prior to judgment but did not.&quot;).Â  As a result, we decline to address this particular\r\n  argument on appeal.Â  See Doe, 370 S.C. at 212, 634 S.E.2d at 55\r\n  (finding wife failed to preserve argument when she did not raise the issue\r\n  specifically at the final hearing or in her Rule 59(e) motion and only\r\n  generally asserted the decree was unsupported by the evidence).\r\nIV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the family court's\r\n  decision to impute additional income to Husband for purposes of calculating\r\n  child support and to require Husband to pay half of Wife's attorneys' fees.Â \r\n  Additionally, we modify the portion of the family court's order regarding its\r\n  classification of Wife's medical expenses as marital debt but affirm its\r\n  decision to divide the debt equally between the parties.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The family\r\n  court did modify one paragraph in its order by permitting Husband to petition\r\n  the family court to terminate supervised overnight visitation with his children\r\n  once a psychiatrist informed both parties' attorneys in writing that Husband no\r\n  longer needed supervised overnight visitation. \r\n[3] Husband argues\r\n  the primary purpose of the surgery was to remove Wife's gallbladder, and Wife\r\n  failed to provide any medical records to substantiate her testimony that the\r\n  surgery related to her miscarriage.Â  Despite Wife's failure to supplement the\r\n  record with medical documentation, we believe both parties' testimony\r\n  sufficiently establishes that the surgery was a direct result of Wife's\r\n  miscarriage.Â  Additionally, Husband failed to contest the source of this debt or\r\n  Wife's lack of documentation after the final hearing, despite his\r\n  ability to do so by way of a post-trial motion.Â  See Kneece v. Kneece,\r\n  296 S.C. 28, 33, 370 S.E.2d 288, 291 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding a party's failure\r\n  to move pursuant to Rule 59(e) to have the family court amend its decree to\r\n  consider the issue of transmutation prevented consideration of issue on appeal).\r\n[4] Husband later\r\n  testified he only gave his father $100 per month, as opposed to $225 per month,\r\n  from the rent he collected on the mobile home.Â  \r\n[5] The family\r\n  court's order misstated Husband's 2004 income, as the 2004 invoice for\r\n  Husband's farrier business reflected monthly earnings of $851.50 as opposed to\r\n  $921.75.Â  Despite this apparent scrivener's error, we discern no error in the\r\n  family court's overall award.Â  \r\n[6] Husband\r\n  testified it cost him approximately $100 per month to maintain the property,\r\n  and he paid his father $100 per month for use of the surrounding property. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4694","title":"Sherlock Holmes Pub v.

Lang, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohnston Cox, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Â In\r\n  this nonjury matter, the circuit court ordered Appellants London I, LLC, and\r\n  Rakesh &quot;Rick&quot; Patel, the principal of London I, to pay attorney's\r\n  fees and costs to Enterprise Bank of South Carolina (EBSC) pursuant to an\r\n  indemnity provision in an assignment and assumption of leases.Â  Appellants contend\r\n  the indemnity provision did not cover legal expenses. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn August 6, 2004, London I entered into an Agreement\r\n  of Sale and Purchase with EBSC, under which London I agreed to purchase from\r\n  EBSC property located in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  The property is commonly\r\n  known as the Palmetto Building and is located at the corner of Main and\r\n  Washington Streets.Â  The Purchase Agreement contained the following language:\r\n\r\n\tThe parties recognize that the City of Columbia, its\r\n  contractors and agents have planned, or are in the process of constructing,\r\n  adjacent to the Property, significant streetscaping improvements and that the\r\n  construction of these improvements might negatively affect the value and use of\r\n  the Property.Â  The risk of any negative impact on value and the cost and\r\n  expense of any loss of use by Buyer or any tenants of the Property is the\r\n  responsibility of Buyer.Â  Buyer and Seller agree to release each other from and\r\n  against any and all claims, losses, costs, expenses, and liabilities including\r\n  reasonable attorneys' fees arising out of or by reason of such streetscaping\r\n  improvements, together with any repairs or modifications to the basement\r\n  required with connection herewith.Â  This release includes, but is not limited\r\n  to, claims for reductions in value, business interruption, water damage,\r\n  injuries and property damage.Â  \r\n\r\nThe transaction closed on September 16, 2004.Â  Among\r\n  the documents executed by EBSC, London I, and Patel during the closing was an\r\n  Assignment and Assumption of Leases.Â  Of particular interest here is the\r\n  following provision appearing in this document:\r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding anything stated herein to the\r\n  contrary, Purchaser acknowledges that (a) basement of the subject property has\r\n  been leased to Andrea Bailey Cooper d/b/a Sherlock Holmes Pub (the\r\n  &quot;Basement Tenant&quot;), (b) there has been water damage to the basement\r\n  which threatens the structural integrity of the basement, (c) the Basement\r\n  Tenant has been forced to leave the basement due to the water and structural\r\n  issues stated above, and (d) the Basement Tenant has not paid rent for three\r\n  months and does not intend to pay rent until all alleged defects in theÂ \r\n  basement are cured.Â  Purchaser hereby releases Seller from any and all claims\r\n  for loss of damage which Purchaser may sustain arising as a consequence of the\r\n  condition of the basement including, but not limited to, those resulting from\r\n  claims and demands from the Basement Tenant or the City of Columbia.Â  Further,\r\n  Purchaser and its Principal, Rick Patel, hereby agree to indemnify and save\r\n  harmless Seller from and against and [sic] and all losses, claims or damages\r\n  suffered by or made against Seller as a consequence of the condition of the\r\n  basement.Â  Seller has reduced the purchase price by the sum of $100,000 as\r\n  consideration for the release and indemnification contained herein, the receipt\r\n  and sufficiency of which is acknowledged by the parties hereto.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  August 19, 2005, Sherlock Holmes Pub, the lessee referred to in the document,\r\n  filed a civil action against the City of Columbia, EBSC, London I, and others\r\n  on various causes of action concerning its lease of the basement of the\r\n  Palmetto Building.Â  In its responsive pleadings, EBSC asserted (1) a\r\n  cross-claim against London I and (2) a third-party complaint against Patel.Â  In\r\n  both of these claims, EBSC alleged it was entitled to attorney's fees and costs\r\n  associated with the claims asserted against it as well as any payment of\r\n  damages it eventually would have to pay to Sherlock Holmes.Â  Appellants timely\r\n  responded to the claims.\r\nEBSC eventually entered into a settlement\r\n  with Sherlock Holmes, but incurred attorney's fees and costs in defending the\r\n  lawsuit and sought to have those paid by Appellants pursuant to the indemnity\r\n  provision of the assignment.Â  Although Appellants did not dispute they owed $7,000.00\r\n  to EBSC as indemnification for the amount EBSC paid to settle the matter, they\r\n  denied any further indemnity obligation.\r\nThe circuit court found the indemnity\r\n  agreement required Appellants to pay EBSC reasonable attorney's fees of\r\n  $30,000.00 and costs of $3,518.57.Â  Both sides moved to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment.Â  The circuit court denied Appellants' motion; however, it granted\r\n  EBSC's motion to include in the award the sum it paid to settle the underlying\r\n  lawsuit.\r\nISSUE\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the\r\n  circuit court erred in awarding attorney's fees and costs to EBSC pursuant to\r\n  the assignment and assumption of leases in view of the fact that attorney's\r\n  fees and costs were not specifically referenced in the indemnity provision of\r\n  the document.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Generally, an action to construe a\r\n  contract is one at law.&quot;Â  Ward v. W. Oil Co., 379 S.C. 225, 238,\r\n  665 S.E.2d 618, 625 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;An action to construe a contract is\r\n  an action at law reviewable under an 'any evidence' standard.&quot;Â  Pruitt\r\n    v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 343 S.C. 335, 339,\r\n  540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).Â  &quot;In an action at law, tried, without a jury,\r\n  the appellate court's standard of review extends only to the correction of\r\n  errors of law.&quot;Â  Pope v. Gordon, 369 S.C. 469, 474, 633 S.E.2d 148,\r\n  151 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend that the failure to\r\n  provide specifically for attorney's fees and costs in the indemnity terms of\r\n  the assignment prevents EBSC from recovering these expenses.Â  In support of\r\n  their position, they emphasize that their indemnity obligation is contractual\r\n  rather than equitable and therefore must be strictly construed.\r\nWe agree the indemnity obligation at issue\r\n  here arises out of contract and for that reason is subject to strict\r\n  construction; however, we do not believe the rule of strict construction\r\n  requires an indemnity provision to include an itemized listing of covered\r\n  losses.Â  On at least two prior occasions, the South Carolina Supreme Court has indicated\r\n  that the absence of any specific mention of attorney's fees and legal costs in\r\n  an indemnity provision does not absolve an indemnitor from paying these\r\n  expenses.Â  See Addy v. Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 33 183 S.E.2d 708,\r\n  710 (1971) (quoting with approval authority supporting the proposition that\r\n  when the duty to indemnify arises under a contract, the indemnitee may recover\r\n  reasonable attorney's fees in defending the claim indemnified against); S.C.\r\n    Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Util. Constr. Co., 244 S.C. 79, 83-85, 135 S.E.2d\r\n  613, 614-15 (1964) (affirming the circuit court's ruling that the plaintiff was\r\n  entitled to indemnification &quot;by reason of the express contract of\r\n  indemnity&quot; and the award of &quot;the full amount prayed for,&quot; which\r\n  included attorney's fees, even though the indemnity clause did not specifically\r\n  mention counsel fees).Â  We realize that the court, when issuing these rulings,\r\n  was not directly responding to the question raised in the present appeal,\r\n  namely, whether counsel fees and legal costs are covered by an indemnity clause\r\n  that does not specifically include these expenses.Â  Nevertheless, these rulings\r\n  are directly on point regarding the controversy before us, and we are therefore\r\n  reluctant to disregard them.Â  See Yaeger v. Murphy, 291 S.C. 485,\r\n  490 n.2, 354 S.E.2d 393, 396 n.2 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;But those who disregard\r\n  dictum, either in law or in life, do so at their peril.&quot;).\r\nIn upholding the circuit court's determination\r\n  that EBSC was entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the\r\n  indemnity provision of the assignment, we concur in the circuit court's\r\n  reliance on Dent v. Beazer Materials &amp; Services, 993 F. Supp. 923,\r\n  939 (D.S.C. 1995), in which the South Carolina District Court allowed a lessor\r\n  to recover &quot;attorneys' fees, settlement costs, and all other allowable\r\n  costs&quot; pursuant to a lease indemnity provision that required the lessee to\r\n  &quot;hold the lessor harmless for any claim made against the lessor arising\r\n  out of the use of the leased premises.&quot;Â  Although, as Appellants argue, the\r\n  District Court cited decisions concerning equitable indemnification rather than\r\n  contractual indemnification in support of its decision, the holding in Dent is consistent with cases from other jurisdictions and other persuasive\r\n  authority.Â  See, e.g., S. Ry. v. Arlen Realty, 257 S.E.2d 841,\r\n  844 (Va. 1979) (noting the majority of jurisdictions follow the rule that when\r\n  &quot;the right of the indemnitee is based upon an express contract, and no\r\n    provision of the contract provides otherwise, . . . the indemnitee may\r\n  recover reasonable attorney's fees and expenses of litigation spent in defense\r\n  of the claim indemnified against&quot;) (emphasis added); 42 C.J.S. Indemnity Â§ 44 (2007) (&quot;[W]here the duty to indemnify is either implied by law or\r\n  arises under contract, and no personal fault of the indemnitee has joined in\r\n  causing the injury, reasonable attorney's fees incurred in resisting the claim\r\n  indemnified against may be recovered as part of the damages and\r\n  expenses.&quot;).Â  \r\nAppellants also contend the fact that the\r\n  release provision in the Purchase Agreement expressly included recovery by the\r\n  indemnitee of attorney's fees and costs demonstrates that the parties intended\r\n  to exclude these items from the indemnity provision.Â  We disagree.Â  First, Appellants\r\n  have not argued to this Court that the indemnity provision was ambiguous;\r\n  therefore, there is no need to &quot;look beyond the four corners to discern\r\n  the parties' intentions.&quot;Â  Silver v. Aabstract Pools &amp; Spas,\r\n  376 S.C. 585, 592, 658 S.E.2d 539, 543 (Ct. App. 2008). Â Second, even if we\r\n  were to consider circumstances outside the agreement, under our standard of\r\n  review, we would not consider the specific mention of these terms in another\r\n  agreement between the parties dispositive of the question of the parties'\r\n  intent even though it is arguably evidence supporting Appellants' position.Â \r\n  Finally, the indemnity provision at issue here, which includes &quot;losses,\r\n  claims or damages suffered by&quot; as well as those &quot;made against&quot;\r\n  EBSC, is, if anything, even more open to the interpretation that attorney's\r\n  fees and costs are covered than is the analogous provision in Dent.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's decision that notwithstanding the absence of any specific\r\n  references to attorney's fees and costs in the indemnity provision of the\r\n  parties' agreement, EBSC is entitled to recover these expenses pursuant to the\r\n  terms of the assignment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  We also agree with EBSC that the indemnity clause at\r\n  issue in this appeal is distinguishable from the indemnity agreement in BP\r\n    Oil v. Federated Mutual Insurance Co., 329 S.C. 631, 496 S.E.2d 35 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998), which Appellants have cited in their brief.Â  In that case, the\r\n  particular indemnity provision under which this Court rejected the indemnitee's\r\n  claim for attorney's fees included only &quot;liabilities for loss,&quot;\r\n  rather than the loss itself.Â  Id. at 641, 496 S.E.2d at 40.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4695","title":"Hargrove v.

Haselden, both of Columbia,\r\n  for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J.:Â  This is an appeal of a workers'\r\n  compensation case.Â  The single commissioner denied benefits and medical\r\n  treatment to Dorothy Hargrove based on his determination that Hargrove failed\r\n  to (1) meet the statutory notice requirement and (2) prove that the problems\r\n  from which she suffered resulted from a workplace accident.Â  The appellate\r\n  panel and the circuit court affirmed.Â  We affirm as well.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHargrove worked as a transcriptionist for Carolina\r\n  Orthopaedic Surgery Associates, P.A., for over twenty years.Â  Before working\r\n  for Carolina Orthopaedic, she worked twenty years as a clerk and\r\n  transcriptionist for the York County Hospital.Â  She intended to retire in 2003,\r\n  but delayed her retirement until the end of 2004 because an issue arose with\r\n  the Social Security Administration about her correct date of birth.\r\nIn 2003, while Hargrove was at work, her chair hit a\r\n  runner and turned over backwards, causing her to fall to the floor.Â  Although\r\n  no one saw her fall, two other employees heard a noise when Hargrove's chair\r\n  fell over and they helped her get up.Â  Hargrove was embarrassed, shaken up, and\r\n  sore, but continued to work that day.Â  Hargrove maintained she promptly reported\r\n  the accident to Mary Elkins, her immediate supervisor. Â Elkins, however, denied\r\n  hearing Hargrove say she had fallen. \r\nHargrove first took samples of Vioxx and Bextra given\r\n  to her by a technician at the office, but later consulted Dr. W. Scott James, a\r\n  physician with Carolina Orthopaedic, when the medications failed to relieve her\r\n  pain.Â  Before she saw Dr. James, Hargrove clocked out for her appointment, as\r\n  she was required to do if her problems were not work-related.Â  Also, when she\r\n  registered as a patient of Dr. James, Hargrove did not indicate her problems\r\n  were work-related even though the form specifically requested this information.\r\nDr. James initially diagnosed Hargrove with bursitis;\r\n  however, a subsequent M.R.I. revealed a moderate extruded disc fragment\r\n  inferior to the L3-4, exerting &quot;mass effect upon the right L4 nerve\r\n  root,&quot; a central herniation at L-S1, and a concentric disc bulge from L1\r\n  through L3.Â  Dr. James then referred Hargrove to Dr. Paul John Tsahakis, who\r\n  performed a right L3-4 microendoscopic decompression.Â  Shortly before her\r\n  surgery, Hargrove applied for short-term disability benefits from Shenandoah\r\n  Life Insurance Company.Â  In addition to short-term disability, she also\r\n  received five hundred sixty hours of donated sick time from other employees in\r\n  the office.Â  Several months later, Dr. Tsahakis found Hargrove reached maximum\r\n  medical improvement with an impairment rating of ten percent.Â  He also\r\n  restricted her to working six hours per day.Â  \r\nIn October 2004, Hargrove returned to work. Â Carolina\r\n  Orthopaedic anticipated Hargrove would retire soon and had already hired\r\n  someone to take her place full time; however, it assigned her tasks that\r\n  students would normally perform.Â  Hargrove continued to work until she retired\r\n  at the end of 2004.Â  By her own admission, Hargrove never told anybody that she\r\n  intended to file for workers' compensation.Â  Furthermore, according to Elkins,\r\n  Hargrove indicated that her back pain resulted from having to care for her\r\n  invalid brother.Â  Elkins stated she first became aware that Hargrove was\r\n  seeking workers' compensation benefits in April 2005, when Carolina Orthopaedic\r\n  received a subpoena for Hargrove's medical records.\r\nOn August 8, 2005, Hargrove filed a Form 50, in which\r\n  she stated the causative event took place September 1, 2003.Â  In its Form 51,\r\n  Carolina Orthopaedic alleged that Hargrove's claim &quot;should be barred under\r\n  Â§ 42-15-20 [because] notice of injury was not given to the employer within\r\n  ninety (90) days as required.&quot;Â  In the form, Carolina Orthopaedic further\r\n  stated it &quot;reserves its right to assert any and all defenses available and\r\n  applicable . . . as evidence may develop in the course of discovery.&quot;\r\nThe single commissioner heard the matter on September\r\n  12, 2006.Â  By order dated and filed January 24, 2007, the single commissioner\r\n  denied Hargrove's claim for benefits, finding (1) Hargrove failed to meet the statutory\r\n  requirement regarding notice to the employer of a workplace injury and (2) even\r\n  if she had met the notice requirement, she failed to prove her current\r\n  complaints resulted from her alleged workplace accident.Â  On May 18, 2007, the\r\n  appellate panel affirmed the order of the single commissioner.\r\nHargrove\r\n  petitioned the circuit court for judicial review of the matter.Â  Following a\r\n  hearing on September 5, 2007, the circuit court issued an order affirming the\r\n  appellate panel.Â  Hargrove unsuccessfully moved to alter or amend the judgment\r\n  of the circuit court and then filed this appeal.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard for\r\n  judicial review of decisions of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n  (1981).Â  &quot;[N]either this court nor the circuit court may substitute its\r\n  judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions\r\n  of fact but may reverse if the decision if affected by an error of law.&quot;Â  Lockridge\r\n    v. Santens of Am., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe decision to\r\n  deny Hargrove workers' compensation benefits, in which all prior tribunals that\r\n  have adjudicated this matter concurred, was based on two independent grounds:Â \r\n  (1) Hargrove's failure to give Carolina Orthopaedic timely notice of her\r\n  workplace accident and (2) her failure to prove the conditions for which she\r\n  sought compensation resulted from the accident.Â  If we affirm either of these\r\n  grounds, we can also uphold the decision to deny workers' compensation benefits.Â  See Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 518 S.E.2d 289, 292\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;Where a decision is based on alternative grounds, either\r\n  of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision\r\n  will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.&quot;).Â  We base\r\n  our affirmance of the denial of workers' compensation benefits on the finding\r\n  that Hargrove failed to prove that the problems for which she sought workers'\r\n  compensation benefits resulted from her accident.\r\nI.&nbsp; Form 51\r\nHargrove\r\n  first argues that because Carolina Orthopaedic did not raise the issue of\r\n  causation in its Form 51, it was unfair to deny her claim on that ground.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Regulations require an employer to &quot;fully\r\n  state its position and defenses, if any, replying to each specification in the\r\n  [claimant's] Form 50 or Form 52.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Regs. 67-603B (Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  Failure by the employer to file the appropriate form &quot;shall be deemed a general denial of liability for the benefits claimed,&quot; resulting in the employer's\r\n  forfeiture of &quot;each special and affirmative defense allowed by the [South\r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation] Act.&quot;Â  Id. 67-603C (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  An employer who has failed to respond to a claimant's workers'\r\n  compensation action is therefore precluded only from raising affirmative\r\n  defenses and may still deny liability.Â  Likewise, we hold that an employer who\r\n  has responded to a workers' compensation claim may assert a general denial of\r\n  liability whether or not the response expressly contests compensability.Â  See Clade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998)\r\n  (&quot;The claimant has the burden of proving facts that will bring the injury\r\n  within the workers' compensation law, and such award must not be based on\r\n  surmise, conjecture or speculation.&quot;).Â  Moreover, as we have noted in our\r\n  narrative of the facts, Carolina Orthopaedic stated in its Form 51 that it\r\n  reserved the right to assert any applicable defenses supported by evidence developed\r\n  during discovery.\r\nII.&nbsp; Proximate cause\r\nHargrove\r\n  next contends the only reasonable conclusion from the competent evidence in the\r\n  record was that her problems resulted from her accident on the job.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nHargrove\r\n  maintains that the &quot;uninterrupted sequence of events leading inexorably\r\n  from her fall to her ruptured disc to her consequent surgery and permanent\r\n  disability,&quot; along with her own testimony on causation, &quot;constituted\r\n  the only evidence in the record and the only plausible explanation for her\r\n  problem.&quot; Â We disagree with this assertion.Â  Regardless of what the\r\n  medical evidence indicated, we cannot disregard the lay evidence on which the\r\n  commission relied in finding Hargrove did not prove her problems resulted from\r\n  her fall.Â  See Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334\r\n  S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999) (&quot;[W]hile medical testimony is\r\n  entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if there is other\r\n  competent evidence in the record.&quot;); Ballenger v. S. Worsted Corp.,\r\n  209 S.C. 463, 467, 40 S.E.2d 681, 682-83 (1946) (&quot;Medical testimony should\r\n  not be held to be conclusive, irrespective of other evidence . . . .&quot;).\r\nHargrove\r\n  clocked out for her appointment with Dr. James even though she was informed\r\n  this would not be necessary for treatment of a workplace injury.Â  Dr. James\r\n  appeared to have been unaware of Hargrove's contention that her problems\r\n  occurred as a result of her fall until he received a report from Dr. Tsahakis\r\n  recounting her version of the events.Â  In addition, Hargrove had reported\r\n  experiencing lower back pain from having to care for her incapacitated\r\n  brother.Â  Furthermore, when she applied for short-term disability benefits,\r\n  Hargrove never indicated her disability resulted from an accident at work.Â \r\n  Hargrove's behavior indicated she herself did not consider her injury to be\r\n  work-related.Â  We will not disturb the appellate panel's decision regarding the\r\n  weight to be given this evidence.\r\nIII.&nbsp; References to social security and\r\n  retirement benefits\r\nHargrove\r\n  complains that evidence of her social security and retirement benefits were\r\n  improperly considered in denying her claim for compensation.Â  We find no error.\r\nHargrove\r\n  argues correctly that procedures regarding retirement and social security\r\n  benefits cannot be used as a basis for a deciding a workers' compensation\r\n  claim. Â See Stephenson v. Rice Servs., 314 S.C. 287, 289-90, 442\r\n  S.E.2d 627, 628 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding the commission cannot rely on a VA\r\n  rating to find a claimant was totally disabled), rev'd on other grounds,\r\n  323 S.C. 113, 473 S.E.2d 699 (1996); Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307\r\n  S.C. 518, 521, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992) (&quot;[A]wards and records\r\n  of the Social Security Administration ordinarily cannot be relied upon to\r\n  support or deny a workers' compensation claim.&quot;). Â \r\nWe\r\n  acknowledge that the single commissioner mentioned Hargrove's aborted attempt\r\n  to retire in 2003 and the fact that she had also applied for social security\r\n  benefits. Â These references to retirement and social security benefits were not\r\n  for the purpose of justifying the decision to deny Hargrove's claim for\r\n  workers' compensation benefits. Â Rather, they provided only additional\r\n  explanation as to why Hargrove, as she readily admitted in her testimony, did\r\n  not tell anyone she intended to file a workers' compensation claim.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we uphold the finding that Hargrove failed to prove her medical\r\n  problems resulted from a workplace injury.Â  Because affirmance of this finding\r\n  is sufficient to uphold the denial of workers' compensation benefits, we\r\n  decline to address the merits of the commission's alternative finding that\r\n  Hargrove failed to timely notify Carolina Orthopaedic of her accident.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKONDUROS, J.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4696","title":"State v.

We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  July 18, 2007, Kelly Ann Tavenier drove Jerry Bridwell to pick up Karim Hudani\r\n  in Spartanburg, South Carolina.Â  Bridwell was going to purchase Lortab pills\r\n  from Hudani.Â  Once Tavenier picked up Hudani, he told Tavenier to drive down a\r\n  road where his friend lived.Â  Tavenier traveled down a dead end street until\r\n  Huckabee drove up in a white car with his girlfriend in the passenger seat.Â \r\n  Hudani got out of Tavenier's car and went over to Huckabee.Â  Huckabee got out\r\n  of his car and walked over to the passenger side of Tavenier's car where\r\n  Bridwell was seated.Â  Huckabee then pulled out a gun, placed it in Bridwell's\r\n  face, and demanded that Bridwell give Huckabee all of his money.Â  Bridwell\r\n  replied that he did not have any money, at which point Huckabee fired several\r\n  shots at the ground and continued to demand Bridwell's money.Â  Tavenier then\r\n  sped off and heard three or four gun shots.Â  As she drove off, she asked\r\n  Bridwell if he was okay and he replied that he had been shot.Â  Bridwell told\r\n  Tavenier to take him to the nearest convenience store because typically police\r\n  officers were always there and Tavenier did not know the route to the nearest\r\n  hospital.[2] Â As she drove, Bridwell dialed 9-1-1.Â  Once they arrived at the convenience\r\n  store, Tavenier got out of the car, found a blanket in the back seat of the\r\n  truck, and used it to apply pressure to Bridwell's back.Â  \r\nMeanwhile,\r\n  when Huckabee returned to his car after Tavenier drove off, Huckabee told his\r\n  girlfriend, &quot;the lady pulled a gun on him.&quot;Â  Hudani testified that he\r\n  did not see Tavenier with a gun in the truck and the only person he saw with a\r\n  weapon was Huckabee.Â  \r\nOnce\r\n  police arrived at the convenience store, Bridwell was transported to the\r\n  hospital and Tavenier was taken back to the crime scene for questioning.Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Tavenier was taken to the sheriff's department for\r\n  additional questioning and for gunshot residue testing.Â  Officer Simmons found\r\n  no gunshot residue present on Tavenier.Â  Officer Simmons further testified that\r\n  there was only a slightly elevated amount of lead on Tavenier's hands which was\r\n  not consistent with having fired or even handled a weapon.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, however, Officer Simmons testified that gunshot residue\r\n  could be removed from a person's hand by wiping it on a blanket or removed by\r\n  exposure to a large amount of blood.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  grand jury indicted Huckabee on two separate charges of assault with intent to\r\n  kill (AWIK) and murder on October 26, 2007.Â  The case proceeded to trial March\r\n  4-6, 2008.Â  During pretrial motions, the court granted defense counsel's motion\r\n  to sequester the witnesses, with the exception of the lead case agent and\r\n  Patricia Bridwell, the wife of the victim.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Huckabee testified that when he approached Tavenier's vehicle, he asked Tavenier\r\n  and Bridwell what they wanted, at which point Tavenier unzipped her pocketbook,\r\n  pulled out a gun, and aimed it at Huckabee.Â  Huckabee stated that Tavenier\r\n  demanded that Huckabee give her all of his money and &quot;dope.&quot;Â \r\n  Huckabee further testified that Tavenier then fired the gun and Huckabee fell\r\n  to the ground as he heard another shot fired.Â  Once she shot again, Huckabee\r\n  pulled his gun out and started shooting into the truck.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the defense rested, the State called Tavenier in reply.Â  Defense counsel\r\n  objected to her reply testimony because she had been seated in the courtroom\r\n  since her initial testimony and, thus, would be in violation of the\r\n  sequestration order.Â  The court responded, &quot;[t]his is reply\r\n  testimony,&quot; to which defense counsel stated, &quot;I understand.Â  But she\r\n  was allowed to stay in the courtroom.&quot;Â  The court noted defense counsel's\r\n  objection and proceeded to allow Tavenier to testify.Â  During her reply\r\n  testimony, Tavenier stated that she has never owned a purse in her life and\r\n  only carries a man's wallet.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  judge charged the jury on the offenses of murder and AWIK, and the lesser\r\n  included offenses of voluntary manslaughter and assault of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature.Â  Additionally, the judge instructed the jury on\r\n  self-defense.Â  In charging the jury on the four elements which make up the\r\n  defense, the judge stated the following regarding the first element:\r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    it must be shown that the defendant was without fault in bringing on the\r\n    immediate difficulty which necessitated the use of deadly force against another\r\n    person that resulted in death or the infliction of serious bodily harm.Â  In\r\n    other words, a defendant cannot provoke or initiate or otherwise through his\r\n    own fault bring about a difficulty and then claim the right of self-defense in\r\n    the use of force in repelling an attack caused by his own provocation.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring\r\n  jury deliberations, the foreperson submitted a question to the judge to define\r\n  legal provocation and to clarify the phrase &quot;without fault&quot; as it\r\n  related to self-defense.Â  Additionally, the jury asked if selling crack cocaine\r\n  was a felony in South Carolina.Â  The court informed the jury the determination\r\n  of whether the distribution[3] of crack cocaine is a felony is not a factor to be considered in its decision.Â \r\n  As to the definition of legal provocation, the court stated:\r\n\r\n  [A]\r\n    sufficient legal provocation is defined as the existence of facts and/or\r\n    circumstances relating to an event as would naturally disturb the sway of\r\n    reason of an ordinary reasonable and prudent person rendering that person's\r\n    mind incapable of cool reflection and producing what, according to human\r\n    experience, may be described as an uncontrollable impulse to do violence. So\r\n    again, a legal provocation is the existence of facts and/or circumstances\r\n    relating to an event that would naturally disturb the sway of reason of an\r\n    ordinary reasonable and prudent person rendering that person's mind incapable\r\n    of a cool reflection and producing what, according to human experience, may be\r\n    described as an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  \r\n\r\nAs\r\n  to the definition of &quot;without fault,&quot; the court clarified &quot;that\r\n  it must be shown that the defendant was without fault in bringing on the\r\n  immediate difficulty which necessitated the use of deadly force against another\r\n  that resulted in death or potentially serious bodily harm.&quot;Â  The court\r\n  further elaborated, &quot;[i]n other words, a defendant cannot provoke,\r\n  initiate or otherwise through his own fault bring about a difficulty that\r\n  necessitates a response of the use of deadly force and then claim the right of\r\n  self-defense . . . .&quot;Â  \r\nOnce\r\n  the jury retired again to the jury room, defense counsel asked the court to\r\n  consider telling the jury that the sale of crack cocaine itself was not the\r\n  fault element that would preclude self-defense. Â Based on the jury's questions,\r\n  he argued that the jurors were assuming the sale of crack cocaine was the fault\r\n  that might eliminate the applicability of the first prong of self-defense.Â  The court stated the jury was simply asking if selling\r\n  crack cocaine was a felony in South Carolina and if it desired additional\r\n  clarification, the jury would request further guidance from the court.\r\nThe\r\n  jury subsequently returned to the courtroom with a written statement from the\r\n  foreman stating that he and his fellow jurors were having difficulty understanding\r\n  the phrase &quot;being without fault in bringing on a difficulty&quot; as it\r\n  related to the defense of self-defense.Â  The court stated, and then repeated:\r\n  &quot;A person claiming self-defense cannot by his own conduct provoke,\r\n  initiate or otherwise through his own fault cause someone to attack him and\r\n  then claim the right of self defense in the use of deadly force in repelling an\r\n  attack which was caused by his own provocation.&quot;Â  The jury retired and\r\n  defense counsel renewed his objection, asking the court to instruct the jury\r\n  again based on the first question that the sale of crack cocaine was irrelevant\r\n  in its deliberations because it appeared the jury was still focused on the same\r\n  question of fault. Â The judge stated that the most recently submitted question\r\n  did not address the issue of crack cocaine or the distribution thereof so he\r\n  had to assume the jury understood the previous question and declined to issue\r\n  any further instruction to the jury.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury returned to the courtroom an hour later and indicated that a decision had\r\n  been reached on one of the indictments but not as to the other indictment.Â  The\r\n  judge instructed the jury to continue to deliberate; thirty minutes later, the\r\n  jury reached its verdict. Â On the indictment for murder, the jury found Huckabee\r\n  guilty of voluntary manslaughter; on the indictment for AWIK, the jury found\r\n  Huckabee guilty of assault of a high and aggravated nature.Â  The court\r\n  sentenced Huckabee to incarceration for a term of thirty years for the offense\r\n  of voluntary manslaughter and incarceration for a term of ten years for the\r\n  offense of assault of a high and aggravated nature, to be served concurrently,\r\n  with credit for the amount of time already served.Â  This appeal followed.[4]Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n(1)&nbsp; Did the trial court err in allowing\r\n  the State's primary witness/victim to testify in reply in violation of the\r\n  sequestration order?\r\n(2)&nbsp; Did the trial court err in\r\n  failing to instruct the jury that the distribution of crack cocaine by appellant\r\n  was irrelevant to the decision?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court only reviews errors of law and is bound by\r\n  the trial court's factual findings unless the findings are clearly erroneous.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus,&nbsp;367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  &quot;The decision whether to waive a sequestration order for witnesses present during the trial rests in the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge.&quot;Â  State v. Saltz,&nbsp;346\r\n  S.C. 114, 126, 551 S.E.2d 240, 247&nbsp;(2001).Â  Likewise, the admission of\r\n  reply testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will only\r\n  result in reversal if the admission of such testimony is found to be\r\n  prejudicial.Â  State v. Farrow,&nbsp;332 S.C. 190, 194, 504 S.E.2d 131,\r\n  133&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998).Â  As to jury instructions, &quot;[t]o warrant\r\n  reversal, a trial court's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\n  erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.&quot;Â  State v. Gaines,&nbsp;380\r\n  S.C. 23, 31, 667 S.E.2d 728, 732&nbsp;(2008).Â  Jury instructions must also be\r\n  considered as a whole, and if the instructions are free from any error, isolated\r\n  portions which might be misleading will not constitute reversible error.Â  State\r\n    v. Sims,&nbsp;304 S.C. 409, 422, 405 S.E.2d 377, 384&nbsp;(1991).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nHuckabee\r\n  argues he was prejudiced by the reply testimony of Tavenier because her testimony\r\n  cast doubt upon his self-defense theory.Â Â  He claims the State called Tavenier\r\n  in reply for the purpose of shaping her testimony to counteract the testimony\r\n  of Huckabee.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of the exclusion rule is, of course, to prevent the possibility of one\r\n  witness shaping his testimony to match that given by other witnesses at the\r\n  trial; and if a witness violates\r\n  the order he may be disciplined by\r\n  the court. The question of the exclusion of the testimony of the offending\r\n  witness, however, depends upon the particular circumstances and lies within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court.&quot; Â U.S. v. Leggett,&nbsp;326\r\n  F.2d 613, 613-14&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1964).Â  A circuit court may order the\r\n  sequestration of any witness by order or by motion of a party. Â Rule 615, SCRE.\r\n  Â However, a party is not entitled to have witnesses sequestered as a matter of\r\n  right;[5] instead, the decision to sequester a witness is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the circuit court. Â State v.\r\n    Simmons,&nbsp;384 S.C. 145, 173, 682 S.E.2d 19, 33-34&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court dealt with a similar issue in State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 509\r\n  S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1998), wherein the appellant argued that the trial judge\r\n  erred in allowing testimony from two of the State's witnesses called on reply\r\n  when both had remained in the courtroom after their initial testimony and both\r\n  had been subject to a sequestration order.Â  Fulton, 333 S.C. at 375, 509\r\n  S.E.2d at 827.Â  Citing the rule that the decision to sequester a witness is\r\n  left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and that such discretion\r\n  extends to the State's right to recall a witness in reply who was present in\r\n  the courtroom during a portion of the trial, the court affirmed the trial\r\n  court's ruling.Â  Id.Â  The court simply stated, &quot;[a]fter a review of\r\n  the record, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in allowing the\r\n  State to present the reply testimony.&quot;Â  Id.[6] Â \r\nMore recently, in State\r\n  v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 682 S.E.2d 19 (Ct. App. 2009), this court found\r\n  no abuse of discretion by the trial court in allowing a witness subject to a\r\n  sequestration order to testify after being in the courtroom during another\r\n  witness's testimony.Â  Simmons, 384 S.C. at 173-74, 682 S.E.2d at 34.Â  In\r\n  so holding, the court explained that there was no evidence presented to\r\n  establish that the witness &quot;knowingly and intentionally entered the\r\n  courtroom in an effort to violate the order.&quot;Â  Id. at 173, 682\r\n  S.E.2d at 34.Â  Further, the witness was only present for a small portion of the\r\n  other witness's testimony which did not pertain to his own testimony. Id. at 174, 682 S.E.2d at 34.Â  Additionally, the witness testified that he entered\r\n  the courtroom because he had been &quot;sent for&quot; as he was the next\r\n  witness to testify.Â  Id.Â  Finally, the court found the witness's testimony\r\n  reflected his notes from interrogating the defendant and the defendant did not\r\n  attempt to show any inconsistencies between the witness's notes and his\r\n  testimony as a result of being present during the other witness's testimony.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nReply\r\n  testimony should be limited to rebuttal of matters raised by the defense,\r\n  rather than to complete the plaintiff's case-in-chief. Â Farrow,&nbsp;332\r\n  S.C. at 194, 504 S.E.2d at 133. &nbsp;&quot;Nevertheless, the improper\r\n  admission of this evidence may not serve as the basis for reversal unless found\r\n  to be prejudicial.&quot; Id.Â  This court has held that a witness\r\n  previously placed under a sequestration order may testify on reply.Â  Fulton,\r\n  333 S.C. at 375, 509 S.E.2d at 827 (finding no abuse of discretion by the trial\r\n  judge in allowing reply testimony from two previously sequestered witnesses who\r\n  had remained in the courtroom following their initial testimony); see also Gattison v. S.C. State College, 318 S.C. 148, 151, 456 S.E.2d 414,\r\n  415&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (finding no abuse of discretion in allowing\r\n  unsequestered witnesses to testify on reply given the limited nature of their\r\n  testimony).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Tavenier to testify in\r\n  reply.Â  On reply, Tavenier was asked only three questions: (1) did she own a\r\n  purse; (2) did she own a pocketbook; and (3) had she ever owned a purse,\r\n  pocketbook, or a shoulder strap of any kind.Â  Tavenier's testimony was limited\r\n  in scope to merely contradict the contention raised by Huckabee that Tavenier\r\n  pulled a gun out of her purse. Â It was not admitted to complete the State's\r\n  case-in-chief.Â  Furthermore, an abuse of discretion does not occur solely\r\n  because the reply testimony is contradictory to the previously presented\r\n  testimony.Â  State v. Todd,&nbsp; 290 S.C. 212, 214, 349 S.E.2d 339,\r\n  340&nbsp;(1986) (&quot;The admission of reply testimony is within the sound discretion\r\n  of the trial judge, and there is no abuse of discretion\r\n  if the testimony is arguably contradictory of and in reply to earlier testimony.&quot;); State\r\n    v. South,&nbsp; 285 S.C. 529, 535, 331 S.E.2d 775, 779&nbsp;(1985) (&quot;Any\r\n  arguably contradictory testimony is proper on reply, and the trial judge properly exercised his discretion.&quot;); State v. Stewart,&nbsp;283 S.C.\r\n  104, 106, 320 S.E.2d 447, 449&nbsp;(1984) (&quot;The admission of testimony which is arguably contradictory of and in reply to earlier testimony does not\r\n  constitute an abuse of discretion.&quot;).Â  Thus, based upon\r\n  prior precedent in South Carolina allowing a sequestered witness to testify on\r\n  reply where that witness was present in the courtroom during other testimony, and\r\n  based upon the content of Tavenier's reply testimony, the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in allowing Tavenier's reply testimony. \r\nNext,\r\n  Huckabee argues that he was prejudiced by the judge's refusal to instruct the\r\n  jurors not to consider the sale of crack cocaine in their deliberations.Â \r\n  Huckabee claims the jury's questions indicated confusion and that the original\r\n  instructions were not sufficiently clear prior to deliberations.Â  We find no\r\n  error in the judge's refusal of counsel's requested charge. Â \r\nIn\r\n  response to the jury's question regarding whether the sale of crack cocaine is\r\n  a felony, the circuit court did not err in responding that the issue of whether\r\n  the distribution of crack cocaine is a felony is not a factor to be considered\r\n  by the jury in its deliberations. In addition, the court also correctly\r\n  declined defense counsel's subsequent request to charge the jury that the sale\r\n  of crack cocaine in and of itself was not the fault which would eliminate the\r\n  possibility of self-defense. &quot;Judges shall not charge juries in respect to\r\n  matters of fact, but shall declare the law.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 21\r\n  (2009).Â  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the charge must be\r\n  considered as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. Daves\r\n    v. Cleary,&nbsp;355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â \r\n  If the jury charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might\r\n  be misleading do not constitute reversible error and the charge is considered correct\r\n  if it contains the correct definition and adequately charges the law.Â  Id. Â &quot;The test for the sufficiency of a jury charge is what a reasonable juror\r\n  would have understood the charge to mean.&quot;Â  State v. Benjamin,&nbsp;345\r\n  S.C. 470, 474, 549 S.E.2d 258, 260&nbsp;(2001).Â  \r\nMoreover, &quot;[n]o\r\n  instruction should be given which tenders an issue which is not presented or\r\n  supported by the evidence . . . [as] even a slight remark, apparently innocent in its\r\n  language, may, when uttered by the court, have a decided weight in shaping the\r\n  opinion of the jury.&quot; State v. Mollison,&nbsp;319 S.C. 41, 48, 459\r\n  S.E.2d 88, 93&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (internal citation and quotation omitted).Â  Thus,\r\n  the trial judge should narrowly tailor his response to the specific jury\r\n  question asked. Â State v. Smith,&nbsp;304 S.C. 129, 132, 403 S.E.2d 162,\r\n  164&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1991) (&quot;Quite often, the judge must tailor, mold and\r\n  even sculpt the law in fashioning an answer to fit the question.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Here, the judge directly answered the specific question that\r\n  was first asked by the jury: whether selling crack cocaine is a felony in South\r\n  Carolina. The jury's second question failed to mention the issue of crack\r\n  cocaine, and thus, the judge's response and refusal to charge the jury on the sale\r\n  of crack cocaine as it relates to the fault element of self-defense was\r\n  adequate to specifically answer the second question. Â Accordingly, we find no\r\n  error in the judge's refusal to give the requested charge; alternatively, we\r\n  find no prejudice as to the instructions given.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Bridwell died as a result of the two gunshot wounds.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\n[3] The judge here used the\r\n  word &quot;distribution.&quot; All other references use the word\r\n  &quot;sale&quot; interchangeably.Â  No issue has been raised as to the use of\r\n  these terms, nor do we believe it affects our disposition.\r\n[4] While both the notice of appeal and appellant's\r\n  brief generically reference the conviction and sentence without specifying\r\n  whether one or both convictions are being appealed, we have proceeded in an\r\n  abundance of caution on both the voluntary manslaughter and assault of a high\r\n  and aggravated nature convictions.\r\n[5] Moreover, we note the rights of victims under article\r\n  I, section 24 of the South Carolina Constitution, known as the Victim's Bill of\r\n  Rights, as well as section 16-3-1550(B) of the South Carolina Code.Â  By this\r\n  statute, a person must not be sequestered from a proceeding adjudicating an\r\n  offense of which he was a victim.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1550(B) (2003).Â \r\n  However, this issue was not raised to or addressed by the trial court and is\r\n  not before us as there was no objection to the sequestration order.Â  \r\n[6] Appellant fails to mention Fulton in his brief\r\n  and only relies on a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\r\n  Circuit for his argument that a sequestration order applies to the exclusion of\r\n  witnesses who have testified in the case-in-chief but may also be called as\r\n  reply witnesses.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4697","title":"State v.

Khingratsaiphon, 352\r\n  S.C. 62, 70, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459-60 (2002).Â  This court reviews the trial\r\n  court's ruling like any other factual finding, and we will reverse only if\r\n  there is clear error.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, we will affirm if any evidence\r\n  exists to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  appeal Brown argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the\r\n  drugs in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.Â  We agree. \r\nÂ The\r\n  Fourth Amendment provides, &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their\r\n  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\r\n  seizures, shall not be violated . . . .&quot;Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  Any\r\n  evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded.Â  Mapp\r\n    v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961).\r\nIt\r\n  is well established that warrantless searches and seizures by the police are\r\n  per se unreasonable, unless they fall within one of several recognized\r\n  exceptions.Â  State v. Weaver, 361 S.C. 73,\r\n  80-81, 602 S.E.2d 786, 790 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  These exceptions include: (1)\r\n  search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) hot pursuit; (3) stop and frisk; (4)\r\n  automobile exception; (5) plain view doctrine; (6) consent; and (7)\r\n  abandonment.Â  Id.\r\nA. Search\r\n  Incident to Arrest[1] \r\nUnder the search incident to\r\n  arrest exception, if the arrest is supported by probable cause, police officers\r\n  may search an arrestee's person and the area within his or her immediate\r\n  control for weapons and destructible evidence without first obtaining a search\r\n  warrant.Â  State v. Ferrell, 274 S.C. 401, 405, 266 S.E.2d 869, 871\r\n  (1980).Â  However, this doctrine does not allow law enforcement officers to\r\n  conduct a warrantless search of an arrestee's automobile after the arrestee has\r\n  been handcuffed or otherwise prevented from regaining access to the car, unless\r\n  it is reasonable to believe (1) the arrestee might access the vehicle at the\r\n  time of the search, or (2) that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of\r\n  the arrest.Â  Arizona v. Gant, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1723-24\r\n  (2009) (limiting New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981) and Thornton\r\n    v. U.S., 541 U.S. 615 (2004)). \r\nThe burden of establishing the existence of circumstances\r\n  constituting an exception to the general prohibition against warrantless\r\n  searches is upon the State.Â  Weaver, 361 S.C. at 81, 602 S.E.2d at 790.Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, neither of the exceptions stated in Gant apply.Â  Officer Williams testified\r\n  he had Brown exit the car to be handcuffed and arrested for the offense of open\r\n  container.Â  He took the duffel bag from the car, placed it on the sidewalk, and\r\n  then put Brown in the back of his patrol car.Â  After securing Brown, Officer\r\n  Williams returned to the car and made &quot;small talk&quot; with the driver.Â  He\r\n  testified:\r\n\r\n\tI\r\n  wanted to deal with him later, but I just wanted to get a glance into the bag,\r\n  so I did unzip the bag, and look in.Â  It was personal items like, perhaps\r\n  deodorant, undergarments . . . and there was a bag of Fritos potato chips, corn\r\n  chips, whatever . . . and it was open, so it was kind of crumpled shut, I\r\n  believe, so I went and just opened it up to get a look into the bag, and then I\r\n  seen inside that bag a -- what appeared to be a plastic bag with a white powdery\r\n  substance, which is -- you know, looks -- appears to be cocaine. \r\n\r\nIt\r\n  is clear from Officer Williams' testimony that Brown was handcuffed and\r\n  securely placed in the patrol car prior to Officer Williams searching the duffel\r\n  bag.Â  During Officer Williams' search, Brown could not have accessed the\r\n  vehicle or the duffel bag.Â  Thus, it was impossible that Brown could have\r\n  accessed the vehicle at the time of the search, making the first exception in Gant inapplicable.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the second Gant exception, Officer Williams was not looking for\r\n  evidence for the offense charged.Â  There was no evidence presented that Officer\r\n  Williams had a reasonable belief that the duffel bag or Frito bag held further\r\n  evidence of the open container violation.Â  Brown told Officer Williams he did\r\n  not have any more beer.Â  More to the point, when asked if the beer can was\r\n  taken into evidence, Officer Williams explained, for this type of charge\r\n  &quot;we don't take that sort of thing in evidence.&quot;Â  We therefore\r\n  conclude the search incident to arrest exception does not apply in the present\r\n  case.[2]Â  \r\nB. The Automobile Exception \r\nBecause\r\n  of its mobility and the lessened expectation of privacy in motor vehicles, a motor\r\n  vehicle may be searched without a warrant based solely on probable cause.Â  State\r\n    v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 491, 351 S.E.2d 570, 571-72 (1986).Â  Just like a\r\n  driver of an automobile, passengers possess a reduced\r\n  expectation of privacy with regard to the property that they transport in\r\n  cars.Â  Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 303 (1999).Â  The\r\n  standard for probable cause to make a warrantless search is the same as that\r\n  for a search with a warrant.Â  State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 332, 457\r\n  S.E.2d 616, 621 (Ct. App. 1995).Â Â Â  \r\nArticulating precisely what probable cause means is not possible.Â  Ornelas v. U.S., 517 U.S. 690, 695-96 (1996).Â  Probable cause is a\r\n  commonsense, nontechnical conception that deals with the factual and practical\r\n  considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal\r\n  technicians, act.Â  Id.Â  Probable cause to search exists where the known\r\n  facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence\r\n  in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a\r\n  particular place.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  principal components of the determination of probable cause will be whether the\r\n  events which occurred leading up to the search, viewed from the standpoint of\r\n  an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to probable cause.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The scope of a warrantless search of an automobile is defined by the object of\r\n  the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that the\r\n  object may be found.Â  State v. Perez, 311 S.C. 542, 546, 430 S.E.2d 503,\r\n  505 (1993). \r\nIf\r\n  probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies\r\n  the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the\r\n  object of the search.Â  Houghton, 526 U.S. at 301-02.Â  This rule applies\r\n  to all containers within a car, without qualification as to ownership of a\r\n  particular container and without a showing of individualized probable cause for\r\n  each container.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, Officer Williams placed Brown under arrest for an open container.Â \r\n  Officer Williams had already recovered the beer can, which interestingly he did\r\n  not take into evidence, prior to searching the duffel bag.Â  Based on this, the\r\n  only evidence Officer Williams could have been searching for was more beer.Â \r\n  The bag in question was not a grocery bag where one would expect to find beer.Â \r\n  Rather, the bag was a zipped-up duffel bag that would be used to carry clothes.Â \r\n  One of the officers stated, &quot;The black duffel bag was more like a gym bag,\r\n  like a small carry-on bag to take on an airplane, or to a gym. . . .&quot;Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Officer Williams never testified he searched the bag to find evidence of a\r\n  crime.Â  According to Officer Williams, he removed the bag from the car because\r\n  it posed a &quot;safety issue,&quot; and because he wanted to separate the bag\r\n  from the driver.Â  Officer Williams stated after he placed Brown in the patrol\r\n  car, he searched the duffel bag because he &quot;wanted to get a glance into\r\n  the bag.&quot;Â  \r\nViewing\r\n  the evidence and testimony through the lens that the State bears the burden to\r\n  prove an exception to the prohibition against\r\n  warrantless searches, as we must, we conclude Officer Williams did not have\r\n  probable cause to search the bag.Â  \r\nC. The Exclusionary Rule,\r\n  Inevitable Discovery, and Inventory Search\r\nThe\r\n  State urges us to accept that the drugs would have been inevitably discovered\r\n  during an inventory search.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  exclusionary rule provides that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal\r\n  search must be excluded.Â  State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541, 560, 216 S.E.2d\r\n  501, 511 (1975).Â  The inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the\r\n  exclusionary rule and states that if the prosecution can establish by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably\r\n  would have been discovered by lawful means, the information is admissible\r\n  despite the fact it was illegally obtained.Â  Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S.\r\n  431, 443-44 (1984).Â  The fruit of the poisonous tree\r\n  doctrine, most often associated with violations of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures, prohibits the use of\r\n  evidence obtained directly or indirectly through an unlawful search or\r\n  seizure.Â  Wong Sun v. U.S., 371 U.S. 471, 484 (1963).Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the police are following standard procedures, they may inventory impounded\r\n  property, including closed containers, to protect an owner's property while it\r\n  is in police custody.Â  Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S. 367, 372-73\r\n  (1987).Â  Standardized criteria or established routine\r\n  must regulate the opening of containers found during inventory searches is\r\n  based on the principle that an inventory search must not be a ruse for a\r\n  general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence. Florida\r\n    v. Wells, 495 U.S. 1, 3 (1990).\r\nThe\r\n  State provided very scant testimony, at best, that the duffel bag or car would\r\n  have been taken into police custody after Brown and the driver were arrested.[3]Â  Although commonsense dictates the police would have\r\n  done exactly this, we are confined by the law that the prosecution bears the\r\n  burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the evidence would\r\n  inevitably have been discovered.Â  Nix, 467 U.S. at 443-44.Â \r\n  Additionally, police must follow standard procedures to conduct an inventory\r\n  search and no such testimony was presented.Â  Thus, we conclude the inevitable\r\n  discovery doctrine does not apply and the trial court erred by failing to\r\n  exclude the evidence.Â  See State v. Grant, 174 S.C. 195, 177 S.E.2d 148, 149 (1934) (&quot;The\r\n  right of people to go about their business without being\r\n  subjected to undue search and seizure . . . by the authorities\r\n  of the law . . . . are essential to an orderly government.&quot;).Â \r\n  Consequently, we reverse Brown's conviction and vacate his sentence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's decision is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Initially, the State argues this\r\n  issue is not preserved for review.Â  We disagree.Â  Trial counsel asked the trial\r\n  court to suppress the evidence, and the trial court denied this request.Â  This\r\n  issue was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court and is properly before\r\n  this court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).Â  \r\n[2] In fairness to the trial court, it did not have the\r\n  guidance provided to us by the United States Supreme Court in the Gant case. \r\n[3] The solicitor asked an officer, &quot;Did you have\r\n  occasion to search that vehicle pursuant to the arrest?&quot;Â  In reply the\r\n  officer testified, &quot;Yes. Yes sir.Â  Under lawful search incident to arrest\r\n  of the vehicle (sic), in the passenger area, and pursuant also to guidelines of\r\n  doing inventory of the vehicle before towing, we searched that vehicle.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4698","title":"State v.

Blitch, Jr., all Â of Columbia; and Cecil Kelly\r\n          Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Mark Baker appeals his convictions for\r\n  committing a lewd act upon a minor, arguing the trial court erred in: (1)\r\n  refusing to quash the indictment; (2) denying his motion for a continuance; (3)\r\n  limiting his cross-examination of a witness; and (4) qualifying a witness as an\r\n  expert in forensic interviewing.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBaker was indicted on five counts of committing a lewd act upon a\r\n  minor and one count of criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  These charges\r\n  arose after Baker's two nieces made allegations that Baker was abusing them.Â \r\n  The younger niece accused Baker of abusing her older sister, Baker's older\r\n  niece.Â  The older niece indicated Baker abused her by rubbing his penis on her\r\n  buttocks, back, and other areas of her body.Â  She testified that Baker kissed\r\n  her, digitally penetrated her, and attempted to make her perform oral sex on\r\n  him.Â  The younger niece stated Baker had also molested her.Â  \r\nThe original indictments alleged these events occurred from May\r\n  2002 through September 2004.Â  However, the five counts of lewd act were amended\r\n  to expand the time frame back to June 1998.Â  Baker moved to quash the\r\n  indictments because they were unconstitutionally overbroad. Â Baker also moved the\r\n  trial court for a continuance, arguing he needed more time to prepare for trial\r\n  because two weeks prior to the trial the time frame was expanded by four years.\r\n  The trial court denied both of these motions.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, the State moved to limit cross-examination of the\r\n  younger niece.Â  During the same month the younger niece accused Baker of abuse,\r\n  she was expelled from school for one year for a narcotics violation.Â  She also\r\n  received a disciplinary infraction for skipping school.Â  Over Baker's\r\n  objection, the trial court agreed to the State's request that Baker not be\r\n  allowed to cross-examine the younger niece about her school disciplinary\r\n  records.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, the State sought to qualify Gwen Herod, a victim\r\n  assistance officer with the Sumter County Sheriff's Department, as an expert in\r\n  forensic interviewing and assessment of child abuse.Â  Despite Baker's\r\n  objection, the trial court qualified Herod as an expert in forensic\r\n  interviewing only.Â  Ultimately, Baker was convicted of four of the five counts\r\n  of lewd act.Â  He was acquitted of criminal sexual conduct and one count of lewd\r\n  act.Â  The trial court sentenced Baker to concurrent fifteen-year terms for three\r\n  of the counts of lewd act and a fifteen-year consecutive term for the fourth count,\r\n  for a total of thirty years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this court reviews errors of law only.Â  State\r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An appellate court\r\n  is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBaker argues the trial court erred by: (1) failing to quash the\r\n  indictments; (2) denying his motion for a continuance; (3) limiting\r\n  cross-examination of the younger niece about her school disciplinary records;\r\n  and (4) qualifying Herod as an expert in forensic interviewing.Â  We address\r\n  each argument in turn. \r\nA. Indictments\r\nBaker\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictments\r\n  because the time frame was overbroad and prevented him from adequately\r\n  preparing a defense.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  indictment is merely a notice document.Â  State v. Gentry,\r\n  363 S.C. 93, 102-03, 610 S.E.2d 494, 500 (2005).Â  The true test of the\r\n  sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and\r\n  certain.Â  Id.Â  Rather, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view\r\n  of all the surrounding circumstances.Â  Id.Â  The sufficiency of the indictment is\r\n  determined by whether: (1) the offense charged is stated with sufficient\r\n  certainty and particularity to enable a court to know what judgment to\r\n  pronounce, and the defendant to know what he or she is called upon to answer\r\n  and whether he or she may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon, and (2)\r\n  whether it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense that are\r\n  intended to be charged.Â Â  Id.Â  \r\nA two-prong test is utilized to determine the sufficiency of an\r\n  indictment involving a purportedly overbroad time period.Â  State v.\r\n    Tumbleston, 376 S.C. 90, 98-99, 654 S.E.2d 849, 853-54 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  The first prong is whether time is a material element of the offense, and the\r\n  second is whether the time period\r\n  covered by the indictment occurred prior to the return of the indictment by the grand jury.Â  Id.Â  \r\nRegarding the first prong, time is not a material element of\r\n  committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  Id. at 101, 654 S.E.2d at 855.Â \r\n  Likewise, time is not an element of criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  State v. Thompson, 305 S.C.\r\n  496, 501, 409 S.E.2d 420, 423 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In the present case, Baker was\r\n  indicted on five counts of committing a lewd act upon a minor and one count of\r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Time is not an essential element in\r\n  either of these offenses; thus, the first prong is met.Â  See State v. Nicholson, 366 S.C. 568, 574, 623 S.E.2d 100, 102-03\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005) (holding if time is not an essential element of the offense,\r\n  the indictment need not specifically charge the precise time the offense allegedly occurred).Â  \r\nAs to the second prong, the offenses complained of occurred from\r\n  June 1998 through September 2004, and Baker was served notice of the amended\r\n  indictments on October 3, 2006.Â  The time period covered by the indictments occurred prior to the return of\r\n  the indictments by the grand jury.Â  Thus, the second prong is met, and the\r\n  indictments were not overly broad. \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  an indictment passes\r\n  legal muster when it charges the crime substantially in the language of the\r\n  statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense\r\n  charged may be easily understood.Â  Tumbleston, 376 S.C. at 98, 654\r\n  S.E.2d at 853.\r\nThe amended indictments for lewd act state: \r\n\r\n  That MARK BAKER, a person over the age of fourteen (14) years, did\r\n    in Sumter County between the period of June 1, 1998 and September 1, 2004\r\n    violate Section 16-15-140 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina . . . in that .\r\n    . . MARK BAKER did willfully and lewdly commit or attempt to commit a lewd and\r\n    lascivious act upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child\r\n    under the age of sixteen (16) years, to wit: [older niece] (Date of Birth:\r\n    1/6/89), with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust,\r\n    passions or sexual desires of himself or of the said child.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 16-15-140, which defines the crime of committing or attempting\r\n  to commit a lewd act on a child, states:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for a person over the age of fourteen years to\r\n    willfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd or lascivious act upon or with\r\n    the body, or its parts, of a child under the age of sixteen years, with the\r\n    intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual\r\n    desires of the person or of the child.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-15-140 (Supp. 2009).\r\nThe indictment for criminal sexual conduct with a minor states:\r\n\r\n  That MARK BAKER did in Sumter County between the period of June 1,\r\n    2004 and September 1, 2004, willfully and unlawfully commit criminal sexual\r\n    conduct with a minor in the second degree by engaging in sexual battery with a\r\n    minor who was at least fourteen (14) years of age but who was less than sixteen\r\n    (16) years of age, to wit: [older niece] (Date of birth: 1/6/89) and the actor\r\n    was in a position of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the\r\n    victim to submit or was older than the victim, to wit: vaginal digital\r\n    intrusion and cunnilingus, in violation of Section 16-3-655(3) of the Code of\r\n    Laws of South Carolina. . . .\r\n\r\nSection 16-3-655, which\r\n  defines criminal sexual conduct, states: \r\n\r\n  A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the\r\n    second degree if: (1)\r\n    the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age\r\n    or less but who is at least eleven years of age; or (2)\r\n    the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is at least fourteen\r\n    years of age but who is less than sixteen years of age and the actor is in a\r\n    position of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the victim to\r\n    submit or is older than the victim.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-655 (Supp. 2009).\r\nThe indictments clearly identify the elements of lewd act and\r\n  criminal sexual conduct.Â  The indictments substantially track the statutory\r\n  language so plainly that the nature of the charged offense can be easily\r\n  understood.Â  The indictments establish the offense of lewd act on a minor as\r\n  defined by section 16-15-140 and the offense of criminal sexual conduct as\r\n  defined by section 16-3-655.Â  Baker's contention regarding the sufficiency of\r\n  the indictments is without merit, and we discern no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  trial court's ruling.\r\nB. Motion for\r\n  a Continuance\r\nBaker\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance based on\r\n  the expanded time frame in the amended indictments.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe trial court's decision to deny a motion for continuance is a\r\n  matter within its discretion.Â  State v. Lytchfield, 230 S.C. 405, 409,\r\n  95 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1957).Â  This court will not reverse the trial court unless\r\n  there was an abuse of discretion that resulted in prejudice.Â  Id.Â  \r\nBaker was served notice of the amended indictments on October 3,\r\n  2006, and his trial commenced on November 13, 2006.Â  Baker had more than one\r\n  month to prepare for the trial.Â  Additionally, the time frame was expanded only\r\n  for the lewd act charges, and as explained above, time is not an essential element for this offense.Â  We see no reversible error in the trial\r\n  court's decision.Â  See id.Â  (holding reversals of the refusal of a continuance are almost as\r\n  &quot;rare as the proverbial hens' teeth&quot;). \r\nC. Cross-examination \r\nRelying on Rule 608(c), SCRE, Baker argues the trial court erred\r\n  by limiting his cross-examination of the younger niece regarding two school\r\n  disciplinary incidents because they demonstrated her bias or motive to\r\n  fabricate the allegation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court.Â  State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d 442, 443\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision will not be overturned unless\r\n  controlled by an error of law resulting in undue prejudice.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  Baker argues the trial court erred by limiting cross-examination of the younger\r\n  niece in violation of his right to confront witnesses conferred by the Sixth\r\n  Amendment of the United States Constitution.Â  This constitutional claim is not\r\n  preserved for review because it was not raised at trial.Â  See State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (holding to be\r\n  preserved for appeal, an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court).Â  During the trial, Baker argued he should be allowed to cross-examine\r\n  the younger niece regarding her disciplinary\r\n  incidents based on Rule 608(c), SCRE.Â  Baker cannot now add a constitutional\r\n  claim on appeal because he cannot raise one ground to the trial court and a\r\n  different ground on appeal.Â  See State v. Addison, 338\r\n  S.C. 277, 284-85, 525 S.E.2d 901, 905 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding issue not\r\n  preserved for appeal where one\r\n  ground is raised below and another\r\n  ground is raised on appeal); see also State v. Gaster,\r\n  349 S.C. 545, 552, 564 S.E.2d 87, 91 (2002) (holding a constitutional claim\r\n  must be raised to and ruled upon to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nAs to the merits of the issue, Rule 608(c), SCRE states,\r\n  &quot;Bias, prejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the\r\n  witness either by examination of the witness or by evidence otherwise adduced.&quot;\r\n  Under this rule, anything having a legitimate tendency to throw light on the\r\n  accuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity of a witness may be shown and considered\r\n  in determining the credit to be accorded to his or her testimony.Â  State v.\r\n    Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 570, 541 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2001).Â  During\r\n  cross-examination, any fact may be elicited which tends to show interest, bias,\r\n  or partiality of the witness.Â  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 325, 531\r\n  S.E.2d 907, 914 (2000).Â Â  \r\nBaker contends the younger niece fabricated the allegations\r\n  against him in an attempt to deflect attention away from her school\r\n  disciplinary incidents.Â  The first incident involved the younger niece being in\r\n  the library when she did not have a pass.Â  As a result, she was written up for\r\n  cutting class.Â  We find it extremely unlikely that this simple incident would\r\n  have a legitimate tendency to show the younger niece would fabricate a story of\r\n  her uncle abusing her older sister in order to avert attention from her minor\r\n  infraction.Â Â Â  \r\nAs to the second incident, the younger niece was expelled from\r\n  school for one year.Â  In October 2004, the younger niece had a prescription\r\n  pill in her possession on school grounds without proper documentation.Â \r\n  Pursuant to the school's no-tolerance policy, she was expelled for one year for\r\n  this infraction.Â  This incident occurred after the younger niece had made the\r\n  allegations against Baker.Â  On October 17, 2004, the younger niece disclosed to\r\n  her mother that Baker had been abusing the older niece.Â  The incident, for\r\n  which she got expelled for one year, did not occur until October 20, 2004, which\r\n  was three days after she confided in her mother.Â  While this incident is a more\r\n  serious infraction than the one described above, it could not have been used to\r\n  demonstrate bias or a motive to misrepresent because it occurred after the\r\n  younger niece made the allegations against Baker.Â  Thus, we see no reversible\r\n  error in the trial court's decision.Â  \r\nD. Expert Witness\r\n  Â \r\nIn his final argument, Baker alleges the trial court erred in\r\n  qualifying Officer Herod as an expert witness and in allowing her testimony,\r\n  which constituted impermissible bolstering.Â  We hold that even if the trial\r\n  court committed error in qualifying Herod as an expert, Baker suffered no\r\n  prejudice as a result of the trial court's decision.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court qualified Officer Herod as an expert in forensic interviewing.Â \r\n  After being qualified as an expert, Officer Herod testified the older niece\r\n  disclosed the abuse while the younger niece denied the abuse.Â  Officer Herod\r\n  opined that, as a result of the interview, she believed the older niece should\r\n  be referred for a medical exam. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court's determination regarding a witness's qualification to testify as\r\n  an expert will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 273, 495 S.E.2d 463, 466 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  facts of this case are similar to the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision\r\n  in State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499, 499-500, 671 S.E.2d 606, 606-07\r\n  (2009).Â  In that case, Douglas was convicted of committing a lewd act on a\r\n  minor.Â  Id.Â  During his trial, Douglas objected to the trial court's\r\n  classification of Officer Herod as an expert in forensic interviewing and\r\n  asserted Herod's testimony improperly bolstered the victim's testimony.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The trial court qualified Herod as an expert and found her testimony relevant\r\n  and admissible.Â  Id.Â  Herod testified she received information leading\r\n  her to conclude the victim needed to be referred for a medical exam.Â  Id. at 501, 671 S.E.2d at 607.Â  Douglas appealed this decision to this court, and\r\n  we concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Herod an\r\n  expert in forensic interviewing.Â  State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 519,\r\n  626 S.E.2d 59, 70 (Ct. App. 2006) (affirmed as modified).Â  \r\nDouglas\r\n  appealed to our supreme court, which reversed our conclusion and stated\r\n  &quot;it was unnecessary for Herod to be qualified as an expert.&quot;Â  Douglas,\r\n  380 S.C. at 501, 671 S.E.2d at 608.Â  However, the supreme court affirmed\r\n  Douglas's conviction and concluded &quot;Douglas suffered no prejudice either\r\n  as a result of Herod's testimony or by her qualification as an expert.&quot;Â  Id. at 503, 671 S.E.2d at 608-09.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if we assume the trial court erred in qualifying Herod as an expert, we find\r\n  Baker suffered no prejudice as a result of this decision.Â  The jury was free to\r\n  accept or reject Herod's testimony.Â  The mere fact that Herod was qualified as\r\n  an expert did not require the jury to give her testimony any greater weight\r\n  than that given to a non-expert witness.Â  The trial court made this point\r\n  explicitly clear by stating:Â  \r\n\r\n  As jurors\r\n    . . . it is your duty to determine . . . the effect, the value, the weight, and\r\n    the truth of the evidence presented.Â  You should consider the expert opinion\r\n    received [into] evidence in this case and like any other evidence give it the\r\n    weight you think that it deserves.Â  If you decide that the opinion of the\r\n    expert witness is not based on sufficient education and experience or if you\r\n    conclude that the reasons given in support of their opinion are not sound or\r\n    that the opinion is outweighed by other evidence you may disregard the opinion\r\n    entirely.Â  An expert witness['s] testimony is to be given no greater weight\r\n    than that of other witnesses simply because the witness is an expert.Â  Further,\r\n    you are not required to accept an expert's opinion even though it is not\r\n    contradicted.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  foregoing demonstrates the jury was informed it was free to assign no weight to\r\n  Herod's testimony.Â  Further, the jury understood Herod's testimony was not to\r\n  be afforded more weight simply because she was qualified as an expert.Â  Thus,\r\n  Baker was not prejudiced by the trial court's decision.Â  See id. at 503, 671 S.E.2d at 609 (&quot;The fact that Herod was qualified as an expert\r\n  did not require the jury to accord her testimony any greater weight than that\r\n  given to any other witness.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nBaker's\r\n  contention that Herod's testimony constituted impermissible bolstering is\r\n  without merit.Â  As in the Douglas case, Herod did not testify she\r\n  believed the testimony of the younger or older niece, and she did not vouch for\r\n  the victims' veracity.Â  Thus, we conclude Herod's testimony did not constitute\r\n  improper bolstering.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4699","title":"Manios v.

We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  is a limited liability company dealing in real estate transactions. In January\r\n  2000, William J. Burk, individually and on behalf of Landex, Inc. and Concord\r\n  Development Group, LLC (collectively, Borrowers) agreed to borrow $1.1 million\r\n  from M&amp;R, including a $100,000 fee to make the loan. The loan was to be\r\n  secured by a 55-acre tract of land in Mecklenburg and Cabarrus counties, North\r\n  Carolina. \r\nM&amp;R retained David Hodge of Nelson Mullins to handle the\r\n  transaction including securing M&amp;R's status as the first priority\r\n  lienholder. M&amp;R had retained Hodge for six or seven real estate\r\n  transactions prior to the transactions in this case. Tim Gilbert, of Nexsen\r\n  Pruet Law Firm's Charlotte office, represented Borrowers and was to perform\r\n  the title work and obtain a title policy. \r\nUnbeknownst to M&amp;R, the property was encumbered by a 1999 deed\r\n  of trust[1] to Michael J. Gallis, which was recorded against the property. The deed of\r\n  trust arose from a 1998 agreement between Borrowers and Gallis.[2] In return for Gallis' &quot;past and present\r\n  efforts&quot; regarding development and zoning on Borrowers' behalf, Gallis was\r\n  to receive a $300,000 fee and a $200,000 bonus payment if re-zoning efforts on\r\n  the secured property were successful. The 1998 agreement states:Â  &quot;This\r\n  Agreement will be secured by a deed of trust described below.&quot; The\r\n  agreement later states:Â  &quot;While this Agreement is fully binding in all\r\n  respects, we would like to prepare a more detailed agreement. . . . Upon\r\n  receiving the information related to the Property, we will prepare the deed of\r\n  trust which will provide for payment to Michael Gallis as provided\r\n  herein.&quot; The deed of trust was for $300,000. \r\nBorrowers\r\n  and Gallis entered into a subordination agreement on May 9, 2000. The\r\n  subordination agreement provided Gallis would subordinate his deed of trust to\r\n  M&amp;R's $1.1 million loan to Borrowers. The agreement provided for penalty\r\n  interest at 5 percent per month, compounded monthly, if payment to Gallis for\r\n  his fee and bonus was not made within one business day after a &quot;triggering\r\n  event&quot; such as a sale, or by July 17, 2000. \r\nBorrowers and their counsel coordinated with Nelson Mullins to\r\n  prepare the subordination agreement. According to a facsimile cover page from\r\n  Hodge, &quot;[t]he idea . . . [was] to make it clear that . . . [M&amp;R's]\r\n  security interest is, and will continue to be, first to the extent of the\r\n  indebtedness.&quot; \r\n\r\n\tThe subordination agreement states in part:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThis Agreement only subordinates the Michael J. Gallis Deed of\r\n  Trust to the Lenderâ€™s [M&amp;Râ€™s] Deed of Trust to the extent of the original\r\n  amount of $1,100,000.00 and any amounts advanced pursuant to the provisions of\r\n  the Lender's Deed of Trust for payment of insurance premiums, taxes, costs of\r\n  collection, or protection of the value of the Lender Property or Lender's\r\n  rights in the Lender Property.Â  This Agreement is not a subordination of the\r\n    lien of the Michael J. Gallis Deed of Trust to any renewals, future advances,\r\n    modifications, or rearrangements of the Lender's Note and Deed of Trust to the\r\n    extent any such modification increases the amount secured by the Lender's Deed\r\n    of Trust.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) The\r\n  subordination agreement was recorded in both counties. M&amp;R likewise\r\n  recorded a deed of trust in each county.Â  \r\nIn December 2000,\r\n  M&amp;R agreed to lend Borrowers an additional $1.6 million to be secured by\r\n  the subject property.[3] M&amp;R again retained Nelson Mullins to represent its interests in the\r\n  transaction. Hodge testified he was &quot;heavily involved in the drafting and\r\n  negotiation&quot; of the note on the second loan. The note provides the loan is\r\n  secured by a deed of trust that &quot;shall be in second position behind the\r\n  Existing Deed of Trust.&quot; The deeds of trust likewise indicate the $1.6 million\r\n  loan is second in priority. \r\nGilbert\r\n  handled the title work and secured the title insurance policy. The title\r\n  commitment indicates the subordination agreement as an exception, but not the\r\n  Gallis deed of trust. The commitment was faxed to Susan Hughes, a licensed\r\n  title insurance agent and paralegal at Nelson Mullins. Hodge did not recall\r\n  reviewing it but conceded &quot;[t]here's an excellent chance that I did.&quot;\r\n  There was no billing record for anyone at Nelson Mullins reviewing the title\r\n  commitment. In preparing the second loan, however, Hughes billed for reviewing\r\n  the prior loan documents. \r\nThe\r\n  title insurance policy also listed the subordination agreement as an exception,\r\n  but not Gallis' deed of trust. Hodge testified he did not realize there was an\r\n  intervening lien between the M&amp;R deeds of trust until a &quot;year or so\r\n  after these transactions occurred.&quot; Hodge testified none of the documents\r\n  put him on notice that the second loan would not have second priority. \r\nBorrowers\r\n  defaulted on the loans and M&amp;R hired Ashley Hogewood of Parker Poe Adams &amp;\r\n  Bernstein, LLP to handle a foreclosure action. At the time, M&amp;R believed\r\n  they had first and second priority. During the course of preparing the\r\n  foreclosure action, Hogewood found Gallis' recorded subordination agreement and\r\n  deed of trust. Hogewood notified M&amp;R. According to Louis Manios of M&amp;R,\r\n  Hodge had never informed him of the subordination agreement. Manios testified\r\n  he told Hogewood:Â  &quot;There's no way. . . . We have got a first and a\r\n  second. David Hodge was told from day one we had to be in the first and second\r\n  position.&quot; Manios testified that he, Rogers, Hodge, and Hogewood met, and\r\n  Hodge claimed to know nothing about a subordination agreement. Although M&amp;R\r\n  had used Hodge in the past, this was the first time it hired Hodge to represent\r\n  it as a lender. Manios testified he dealt only with Nelson Mullins and was not\r\n  aware Nexsen Pruet was involved. \r\nRobert\r\n  McNeill, an attorney hired by the title insurance company, testified the\r\n  priority of liens in North Carolina is not determined in a foreclosure action\r\n  but in a separate proceeding in Superior Court. In this case, the foreclosure\r\n  sale was held in December 2001. M&amp;R bid $1,418,500 for the property. The\r\n  bidding in North Carolina is held open for ten days and a subsequent bid must\r\n  exceed the latest bid by five percent. Gallis bid $1,495,000. The Speedway, who\r\n  owned property adjacent to the subject property, entered the next bid of\r\n  $1,569,750. The required amount for a subsequent bid was $1,648,237. M&amp;R\r\n  entered a bid of $3,328,000. This was the final bid and the property was deeded\r\n  to M&amp;R. The Final Report and Account of Foreclosure Sale reports M&amp;R\r\n  was paid $1,390,304.79 but that &quot;Adverse claims are asserted and the\r\n  Trustee is in doubt as to who is entitled to surplus&quot; funds of $1,923,137.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  March 2002, Gallis filed a petition to determine the ownership of the surplus\r\n  funds. Gallis claimed entitlement to the second lien priority and $795,989.28,\r\n  including compound interest. The title insurance company hired Robert McNeill\r\n  to represent M&amp;R in Gallis' action. The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment to Gallis and ordered that $300,000 of the surplus proceeds be\r\n  distributed to Gallis. M&amp;R appealed. The North Carolina Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed the trial court and remanded the matter for trial. M&amp;R settled\r\n  with Gallis for $300,000. M&amp;R filed this action alleging legal malpractice,\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Manios testified M&amp;R borrowed $1 million from NBSC to lend to\r\n  Borrowers on the first note. Hodge was aware M&amp;R borrowed funds to make\r\n  this loan. Manios explained the bank required additional collateral for the\r\n  $1.6 million loan, so he and his partner, Jimmy Rogers, pledged other real\r\n  property and personally-owned stock to borrow the loan amount to lend to\r\n  Borrowers. Hodge knew M&amp;R had to borrow money to fund both loans, and the\r\n  partners had to pledge personal assets to fund the $1.6 million loan. \r\nM&amp;R\r\n  also borrowed $3.2 million to purchase the property at the foreclosure sale.\r\n  M&amp;R paid interest on the $1.1 million loan until it was paid as the first\r\n  lienholder from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale; paid $316,225 in interest\r\n  on the $1.6 million loan during the note period and the three years of\r\n  litigation; and paid interest on the $3.2 million loan. \r\nThe\r\n  parties introduced expert testimony at trial. Warren Herndon, Jr., a real\r\n  estate lawyer practicing in South Carolina, was qualified as an expert as to\r\n  the standard of care owed by a South Carolina attorney with reference to a\r\n  commercial real estate transaction. Herndon testified Hodge had a &quot;duty to\r\n  fully find out what was represented by the subordination agreement, and . . .\r\n  to find out&quot; the effect on the new loan. Herndon opined Hodge and Nelson\r\n  Mullins failed to meet their obligations to M&amp;R in connection with the $1.6\r\n  million loan, and the deviation from the standard of care was the proximate\r\n  cause of damages to M&amp;R. Herndon testified obtaining the title policy did\r\n  not automatically discharge the attorney's obligation to the client. During\r\n  cross-examination, Herndon admitted Gilbert should have notified Borrowers, the\r\n  title company, and Hodge about the Gallis lien when doing the title work for\r\n  the closing on the $1.6 million loan. Herndon testified Hodge should have\r\n  reviewed the subordination agreement at the time of the $1.6 million loan as it\r\n  &quot;was such an important part of making sure the lien position was correctly\r\n  handled in the first lien.&quot; \r\nH.\r\n  Dave Whitener, Jr. was qualified as an expert in real estate law. Whitener\r\n  opined Hodge did not deviate from the standard of care by relying on the title\r\n  insurance policy and failing to conduct an independent title search for either\r\n  loan. Whitener testified the Gallis deed of trust should have been reflected in\r\n  the warranty sections of M&amp;R's deeds of trust for the $1.6 million loan.\r\n  Whitener stated the title commitment and policy should also have mentioned the\r\n  Gallis lien. Due to the failure of these documents to mention the Gallis lien,\r\n  according to Whitener, Hodge could logically conclude the Gallis lien had been\r\n  satisfied or was no longer a lien against the property as it related to the\r\n  $1.6 million loan. Finally, Whitener concluded Hodge met the standard of care\r\n  in handling a real estate transaction by relying on the documents, which placed\r\n  the two M&amp;R loans in first and second priority. Whitener conceded he would\r\n  have determined the $1.6 million loan was not in second position. \r\nAt\r\n  the close of M&amp;R's case, the trial court granted Nelson Mullins' motions\r\n  for directed verdicts as to: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) punitive damages\r\n  on the breach of contract action; and (3) punitive damages on the malpractice\r\n  claim, finding insufficient evidence to support punitive damages.Â  The trial\r\n  court also granted Nelson Mullins' motion to strike M&amp;R's claim of damages\r\n  for lost profits. The court gave a curative instruction to the jury to\r\n  disregard the evidence of lost profits. The trial court, inter alia,\r\n  denied Nelson Mullins' motions for directed verdicts as to:Â  (1) the statute of\r\n  limitations; (2) breach of contract; (3) a bar of the malpractice claim by\r\n  comparative negligence; and (4) a bar of the malpractice claim by intervening\r\n  negligence. The trial court also denied Nelson Mullins' motion to strike the\r\n  claim for interest damages. At the close of the evidence, the trial court\r\n  denied both parties' motions for directed verdicts. \r\nThe\r\n  jury found for Nelson Mullins on the malpractice claim and for M&amp;R on the\r\n  breach of contract claim, awarding $53,088 in damages. The trial court denied\r\n  the parties' post-trial motions. All parties appealed.Â  \r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn\r\n  an action at law on appeal of a case tried by a jury, this court's review is\r\n  restricted to corrections of errors of law. Factual findings of the jury will\r\n  not be disturbed unless there is no evidence reasonably supporting the\r\n  findings. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85,\r\n  221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; M&amp;R's Appeal\r\nA.&nbsp; Nisi Additur\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for new trial nisi additur.\r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  determination of damages by a jury is entitled to substantial deference.Â  Stevens\r\n    v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 446-47, 520 S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n  &quot;The trial court has the power to grant a new trial nisi additur when it finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate.&quot; Ligon\r\n    v. Norris, 371 S.C. 625, 635, 640 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2006). The\r\n  denial of a motion for additur is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Id. &quot;The consideration of a motion for a new trial nisi additur requires the court to consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of the\r\n  evidence presented.&quot; Id.Â  There is no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  trial court's denial of a motion for new trial nisi where there is\r\n  evidence to support the verdict. Id. at 635, 640 S.E.2d at 473.\r\n  &quot;When considering a motion for a new trial based on the inadequacy or\r\n  excessiveness of the jury's verdict, the trial court must distinguish between\r\n  awards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are\r\n  actuated by passion, caprice, or prejudice.&quot; Elam v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27, 602 S.E.2d 772, 781 (2004).\r\nIn Todd\r\n  v. Joyner, 385 S.C. 509, 512, 685 S.E.2d 613, 615 (Ct. App. 2008), aff'd,\r\n  385 S.C. 421, 685 S.E.2d 595 (2009), this court affirmed the trial court's\r\n  denial of Todd's motion for new trial nisi additur where Joyner\r\n  stipulated to her negligence and the jury awarded only the amount of Todd's\r\n  medical expenses. We found evidence in the record supporting Joyner's argument\r\n  at trial that not all of the damages claimed were proximately caused by Joyner. Id. at 517, 685 S.E.2d at 618.Â  \r\nIn Ligon,\r\n  371 S.C. at 635, 640 S.E.2d at 472-73, this court likewise affirmed the trial\r\n  court's denial of plaintiff's motion for new trial nisi additur.Â \r\n  In Ligon, plaintiff claimed a one percent interest in a corporation,\r\n  alleging damages of $5,468,881, the value of the one percent at the time of the\r\n  initial public stock offering. Id. at 631-32, 640 S.E.2d at 470. This\r\n  court found evidence in the record that the jury could have relied on to value\r\n  the corporation at a time other than the initial stock offering in reaching its\r\n  verdict of $382,148.Â  Id. at 632-33, 640 S.E.2d at 471.\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  claimed damages of $316,225, which was the interest paid on the funds it\r\n  borrowed to make the $1.6 million loan. M&amp;R claimed entitlement to this\r\n  interest based on the three years the surplus funds were held by the court\r\n  pending resolution of the Gallis claim. Although it is unclear from the record\r\n  exactly how the jury arrived at its verdict of $53,088, there is evidence to\r\n  support an award of less than $316,225. As in Todd, the jury could have\r\n  determined that not all of the interest claimed was proximately caused by the\r\n  breach of contract. For instance, at the time M&amp;R bid $3.328 million for\r\n  the property during the foreclosure bidding, the bid was at $1,569,750 and\r\n  M&amp;R could have bid five percent above that bid rather than $3.328 million.[4]\r\nAs\r\n  in Ligon, the jury in this case could have determined M&amp;R was\r\n  entitled to interest for a period less than three years. For instance, the\r\n  trial court awarded Gallis $300,000 in September 2003. The North Carolina Court\r\n  of Appeals' judgment was entered in December 2004. M&amp;R and Gallis settled\r\n  for $300,000 after that time. We find no error by the trial court in denying\r\n  M&amp;R's motion for new trial nisi additur.\r\nB.&nbsp; Lost Profits\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  argues the trial court erred in striking its claim of damages for lost profits.\r\n  We disagree.\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  claimed it had to forego other investment opportunities during the period of\r\n  the North Carolina litigation and this was foreseeable to Nelson Mullins.\r\n  Manios testified M&amp;R lost $120,000 due to a loan they could not make in\r\n  October 2002 to developer Arthur Cleveland, and $96,000 in December 2003 on\r\n  another loan to Cleveland. Manios testified he and Rogers lost profits of\r\n  $655,600 on Pinckney Retreat, a development in Beaufort, because their assets\r\n  were tied up and M&amp;R had to bring in outside investors. M&amp;R also claimed\r\n  to have lost the benefit of a tax deduction worth $228,000 from the donation of\r\n  a conservation easement to the Beaufort Historical Society. The trial court\r\n  struck the claim for lost profits, finding them not foreseeable. The court\r\n  stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[C]ertainly\r\n  it was well within the contemplation that [Hodge] was aware that personal\r\n  assets had been pledged . . . and I think it is foreseeable that if there was a\r\n  problem . . . that those assets could be tied up[;] I do not find that it is\r\n  foreseeable that . . . he would understand that by tying up those personal\r\n  assets in this particular transaction that [M&amp;R] would then be prohibited\r\n  from using those personal assets in . . . other individual projects down the\r\n  road. \r\n\r\nLost\r\n  profits may be recovered in a breach of contract action under a three-prong\r\n  test:\r\n\r\n\tFirst, profits must have been prevented or\r\n  lost as a natural consequence of the breach of contract. The second requirement is foreseeability; a breaching party is liable for those damages, including lost profits, which may reasonably be supposed to have been within the\r\n  contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made as a probable\r\n  result of the breach of it. The crucial requirement in lost profits determinations is that they be established with reasonable\r\n  certainty, for recovery cannot be had for profits that are conjectural or\r\n  speculative.\r\n\r\nDrews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe\r\n  Assocs., 296 S.C. 207, 213, 371\r\n  S.E.2d 532, 535-36 (1988) (internal citations omitted). Damages must either\r\n  flow as a natural consequence of the breach or have been reasonably within the\r\n  parties' contemplation at the time of the contract. Hawkins v. Greenwood\r\n    Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 595, 493 S.E.2d 875, 880 (Ct. App. 1997); see S.C. Fin. Corp. of Anderson v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. 109, 122,\r\n  113 S.E.2d 329, 335-36 (1960) (stating &quot;profits that have been prevented\r\n  or lost as the natural consequence of a breach of contract are recoverable as\r\n  an item of damages in an action for such breach&quot;).Â  \r\nIn Sterling Development Co. v. Collins, the South Carolina Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  claiming lost profits,\r\n  the degree of proof required is that of reasonable certainty. The proof must\r\n  pass the realm of conjecture, speculation or opinion not founded on facts, and\r\n  must consist of actual facts from which a reasonably accurate conclusion\r\n  regarding the cause and the amount of the loss can be logically and rationally\r\n  drawn. \r\n\r\n309 S.C. 237, 242, 421 S.E.2d\r\n  402, 405&nbsp;(1992) (internal citation omitted).\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court did not err in finding lost profits in this case were not\r\n  in the contemplation of the parties. Although Hodge knew Manios and Rogers were\r\n  pledging personal assets to fund the $1.6 million loan, this was the first time\r\n  M&amp;R had used Hodge in a transaction in which M&amp;R was lending money to a\r\n  third party. Furthermore, the Pinckney Retreat project was approximately three\r\n  years after the $1.6 million loan was made. We conclude it was not foreseeable\r\n  that Hodge would understand that by pledging personal assets on the $1.6\r\n  million loan, M&amp;R would potentially lose future business opportunities.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Denial of Directed Verdict\r\n  on Legal Malpractice Claim\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict or\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of legal malpractice. We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the appellate court applies the same standard as the trial court. Elam\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004).\r\n  The court must view the evidence and inferences that\r\n  reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party. Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236\r\n  (2002). The appellate court will only reverse the trial court's ruling when\r\n  there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by\r\n  an error of law. Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation,\r\n  336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). \r\nIn an action for legal malpractice, the claimant must prove four elements:\r\n  (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) breach of a duty by\r\n  the attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) proximate causation of the\r\n  client's damages by the breach. Smith v. Haynsworth,\r\n    Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 435 n.2, 472 S.E.2d 612, 613 n.2\r\n  (1996). \r\nDuring\r\n  the trial, each side presented expert testimony. Herndon testified Nelson Mullins did not meet its obligations to\r\n  M&amp;R in connection with the $1.6 million loan because it did not fully\r\n  explore the effect of the subordination agreement although it was listed in the\r\n  title insurance commitment. Herndon opined this deviation from the standard of\r\n  care caused damages to M&amp;R. Contrarily, Whitener testified Nelson Mullins\r\n  did not deviate from the standard of care by relying on the loan documents that\r\n  placed the two M&amp;R loans in first and second priority. Viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to Nelson Mullins, the trial court did not err in denying\r\n  M&amp;R's motion for directed verdict on the legal malpractice claim.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp; Denial of Motion for New\r\n  Trial Absolute on Damages Based on Jury Instructions Regarding Intervening Acts\r\nM&amp;R\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for a new trial absolute on\r\n  the issue of damages based on erroneously charging the jury on intervening acts\r\n  in the jury instructions on proximate cause. We disagree.[5]\r\nThe\r\n  grant or denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial\r\n  court and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless the findings are\r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by\r\n  error of law. Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 403, 477 S.E.2d 715, 722\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996). An appellate court will not reverse a trial court's ruling\r\n  regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its discretion. Clark\r\n    v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000). &quot;When instructing the jury, the trial court\r\n  is required to charge only principles of law that apply to the issues raised in\r\n  the pleadings and developed by the evidence in support of those issues.&quot; Id. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539. \r\n&quot;Evidence\r\n  of an independent negligent act of a third party is directed to the question of\r\n  proximate cause.&quot; Matthews v. Porter, 239 S.C. 620, 628, 124 S.E.2d\r\n  321, 325 (1962). &quot;The intervening negligence of a third person will not\r\n  excuse the first wrongdoer if such intervention ought to have been foreseen in\r\n  the exercise of due care. In such case, the original negligence still remains\r\n  active, and a contributing cause of the injury.&quot; Bishop v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 89, 502 S.E.2d 78, 83 (1998). Ordinarily,\r\n  proximate cause is a question for the jury. McKnight v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n  385 S.C. 380, 387, 684 S.E.2d 566, 569 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nDuring\r\n  the trial, evidence of intervening acts of others was presented including\r\n  Whitener's testimony that the title insurance policy on the first loan\r\n  contained an error by omitting mention of the Gallis deed of trust. This error,\r\n  according to Whitener, &quot;end[ed] up perpetuating itself through the title\r\n  insurance commitment for the [$]1.6 [million loan] and later the title\r\n  insurance policy . . . .&quot; Whitener testified the second title insurance\r\n  policy was probably based on an &quot;update of the title[,]&quot; leading\r\n  &quot;to the problem that later presented itself with the issue as to what\r\n  happened to the Gallis lien.&quot; We find no error by the trial court in\r\n  denying M&amp;R's motion for new trial absolute based on jury instructions\r\n  regarding intervening acts of negligence.\r\nII.&nbsp; Nelson Mullins' Appeal\r\nA.&nbsp; Denial of Motion for\r\n  Summary Judgment\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary\r\n  judgment. Prior to trial, Nelson Mullins moved for summary judgment and the\r\n  trial court denied the motion. &quot;[T]he denial of a motion for summary\r\n  judgment before trial is not reviewable after a trial of a case on its\r\n  merits.&quot; Holloman v. McAllister, 289 S.C. 183, 186, 345 S.E.2d 728,\r\n  729 (1986). Accordingly, we decline to address this issue.\r\nB.&nbsp; Motion to Strike Evidence\r\n  of Damages\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motion to strike evidence\r\n  of damages including interest paid on the $1.6 million loan and lost profits.\r\n  We disagree.\r\n1.&nbsp; Interest\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Pike v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000). A motion to\r\n  strike is likewise within the trial court's discretion and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Mayes v. Paxton, 313 S.C. 109, 115, 437\r\n  S.E.2d 66, 70 (1993). The trial court found the interest paid was a foreseeable\r\n  consequence of pledging assets and denied the motion to strike evidence of\r\n  interest. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of Nelson\r\n  Mullins' motion to strike evidence of interest paid on the $1.6 million loan.\r\n2.&nbsp; Lost Profits\r\nAt\r\n  the close of M&amp;R's case, the trial court granted Nelson Mullins' motion to\r\n  strike M&amp;R's claim of damages for lost profits. The court gave a curative\r\n  instruction to the jury to disregard the evidence of lost profits. The trial\r\n  court stated: \r\n\r\n\t[A]ny\r\n  damages that . . . have been claimed relating to the Pinckney Landing, the\r\n  Beaufort County transaction, are not allowed; as well as any damages that are\r\n  claimed from the inability to make certain loans to Mr. Cleveland . . . those\r\n  also are not allowed.Â  Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, you are to treat that\r\n  evidence as if it had not been presented to you. You must not consider it in\r\n  any way in your deliberations when we get to that particular point. It is no\r\n  longer an issue for you all to consider. \r\n\r\nA\r\n  curative instruction is generally deemed to have cured any alleged error. State\r\n    v. White, 371 S.C. 439, 445, 639 S.E.2d 160, 163 (Ct. App. 2006). We find\r\n  the trial court's curative instruction was sufficient to cure any alleged error\r\n  arising from the evidence of lost profits.\r\nC.&nbsp; Denial of Motion for\r\n  Directed Verdict\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed\r\n  verdict on the issues of: (1) the statute of limitations; (2) the measure of\r\n  damages; (3) breach of contract; and (4) legal malpractice. We disagree.\r\n&quot;In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict\r\n  motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or non-existence\r\n  of evidence.&quot; Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). The trial court must view the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. at 714, 541 S.E.2d at 860. If the\r\n  evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the\r\n  case should be submitted to the jury. Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole,\r\n  351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002). &quot;In an action at law,\r\n  on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this Court extends\r\n  merely to the corrections of errors of law.&quot; Pinckney v. Winn-Dixie\r\n    Stores, Inc., 311 S.C. 1, 3, 426 S.E.2d 327, 328 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\n1.&nbsp; Statute of Limitations\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict\r\n  based on the statute of limitations. This action is governed by a three-year\r\n  statute of limitations period. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-3-530 (1) &amp; (5)(2005). See RWE Nukem v. ENSR Corp., 373 S.C. 190, 196, 644 S.E.2d 730, 733 (2007)\r\n  (applying three year statute of limitations in breach of contract action); Berry\r\n    v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 444-45, 492 S.E.2d 794, 799 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (finding three year statute of limitations applies to legal malpractice\r\n  actions). The discovery rule applies in this action. See Kelly v.\r\n    Logan, Jolley, &amp; Smith, LLP, 383 S.C. 626, 632-33, 682 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009) (applying discovery rule in legal malpractice action); Maher v.\r\n    Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 376-77, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (applying discovery rule in breach of contract action). According to the\r\n  discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a person could or\r\n  should have known, through the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of\r\n  action might exist. Abba Equip., Inc. v. Thomason, 335 S.C. 477, 485,\r\n  517 S.E.2d 235, 239 (Ct. App. 1999). If\r\n  there is conflicting evidence as to whether a claimant knew or should have\r\n  known he or she had a cause of action, the question is one for the jury. Moriarty\r\n    v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 338-39, 534 S.E.2d 672,\r\n  681-82 (2000).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  Borrowers defaulted on the loans, M&amp;R hired Hogewood to handle the\r\n  foreclosure action. Manios testified in his deposition that he contacted\r\n  Hogewood in May 2001. According to Manios, Hogewood informed him about a month\r\n  later of the Gallis deed of trust. Hogewood testified he became aware of the\r\n  problem when preparing to file the foreclosure action, about\r\n  &quot;Octoberish.&quot; He further testified he did not determine the Gallis\r\n  deed of trust would interfere with the foreclosure sale proceeds until\r\n  receiving the order to foreclose and the foreclosure sale was held. The\r\n  foreclosure sale was held in December 2001. The Final Report and Account of Foreclosure Sale, indicating adverse claims\r\n  were asserted, was issued on February 28, 2002. Gallis filed his petition to\r\n  determine the ownership of surplus funds in March 2002. This action was filed in November 2004. \r\nWe\r\n  find the date the statutes of limitations began to run involves questions for\r\n  the jury and find there was no error by the trial court in denying the motion\r\n  for directed verdict on the issue of statutes of limitations.\r\n2.&nbsp; Measure of Damages\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for directed\r\n  verdict, which was based on the measure of damages, and alleges the proper\r\n  amount of damages for a missed lien is the amount it takes to remove that lien\r\n  from the property. Nelson Mullins argues because the title insurance company\r\n  paid the settlement amount to Gallis, M&amp;R suffered no damages to remove the\r\n  lien and was not entitled to interest paid on the $1.6 million loan during the\r\n  pendency of the litigation. We find no error. \r\nIn\r\n  a breach of contract action, a party may recover for those injuries that the defendant had reason to foresee as a probable result of his breach when the contract was made. Benford\r\n    v. Berkeley Heating Co., 258 S.C. 357, 362-63, 188 S.E.2d 841, 842-43\r\n  (1972). The proper measure of damages for breach of contract is the loss that\r\n  was actually suffered as the result of the breach. S.C. Fin. Corp. of\r\n    Anderson v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. 109, 122, 113 S.E.2d 329, 335\r\n  (1960). In this case, although the title insurance company paid the Gallis\r\n  settlement funds, M&amp;R alleged damages including interest paid on the funds it\r\n  borrowed to make the $1.6 million loan to Borrowers.\r\n3.&nbsp; Denial of Directed Verdict\r\n  on Breach of Contract Claim\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed\r\n  verdict on the breach of contract cause of action. We disagree. \r\nIn\r\n  deciding a motion for directed verdict, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Dalon\r\n    v. Golden Lanes, Inc., 320 S.C. 534, 538, 466 S.E.2d 368, 370 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996). If more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must\r\n  be submitted to the jury. Id. The necessary elements of a contract are\r\n  offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth.\r\n    of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003). To recover for a\r\n  breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove: (1) a binding contract; (2) a\r\n  breach of contract; and (3) damages proximately resulting from the breach. Fuller\r\n    v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).\r\nViewed\r\n  in the light most favorable to M&amp;R, there is evidence in the record that\r\n  M&amp;R contracted with Nelson Mullins to provide legal services to protect its\r\n  status as a first-priority lienholder for both loans. Manios testified Hodge\r\n  knew M&amp;R wanted to remain first in priority. M&amp;R also presented\r\n  evidence of a breach of the agreement through expert testimony that Nelson\r\n  Mullins failed to protect this priority status. Finally, M&amp;R presented\r\n  evidence of damages proximately resulting from the breach in the form of\r\n  interest. Therefore, we find the trial court properly submitted this issue to\r\n  the jury.\r\n4.&nbsp; Denial of Directed Verdict\r\n  on Malpractice Claim\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins next argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed\r\n  verdict on the legal malpractice cause of action. We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  jury returned a verdict for Nelson Mullins on the legal malpractice claim so\r\n  Nelson Mullins is able to show no prejudice resulting from the trial court's\r\n  failure to direct a verdict in its favor on legal malpractice. See Am.\r\n    Fed. Bank v. Number One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 174-75, 467\r\n  S.E.2d 439, 442 (1996) (stating the conduct of a trial is within the trial\r\n  judge's sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal without a showing\r\n  of abuse of discretion, error of law, and resulting prejudice). \r\nD.&nbsp; Denial of Motion for\r\n  Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\r\nNelson\r\n  Mullins argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). We disagree. \r\nIn\r\n  ruling on a motion for JNOV, the trial judge must view the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp.,\r\n  356 S.C. 85, 92 n.4, 588 S.E.2d 87, 90 n.4 (2003). The court should not grant\r\n  JNOV where the evidence yields more than one inference. Id. An appellate\r\n  court may not overturn the decision of the trial court if there is any evidence\r\n  to support the trial court's ruling. Id. This is the same standard\r\n  applied to a motion for directed verdict. Creech v. S.C. Wildlife &amp;\r\n    Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997). For the\r\n  reasons discussed in reviewing Nelson Mullins' motions for directed verdicts,\r\n  we find no error by the trial court in denying its motion for JNOV.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the jury verdict and orders on appeal are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nLOCKEMY, J. and\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A\r\n  deed of trust is a security interest in property, similar to a mortgage. See Black's Law Dictionary 414 (6th 1990) (defining a deed of trust).\r\n[2] This and other agreements at issue here are between\r\n  Gallis and two companies including one of Borrowers', Concord Development Group,\r\n  LLC. \r\n[3] There were two loans, one for $400,000 and one for\r\n  $1.2 million, consolidated into one loan.\r\n[4] The trial court denied Nelson Mullins' motion for a\r\n  directed verdict based on comparative and/or intervening negligence. The trial\r\n  court permitted Nelson Mullins to argue M&amp;R's bid of $3.328 million was not\r\n  foreseeable. \r\n[5] Nelson Mullins argues this issue is not preserved because\r\n  the trial court did not rule on its motion for directed verdict based on\r\n  intervening acts, made at the close of all evidence. Nelson Mullins made the\r\n  motion in conjunction with several other motions. The trial court stated:\r\n  &quot;I think those are all jury issues, and so I'm going to deny them on that\r\n  basis.&quot; To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must be\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998). We find the issue is preserved and\r\n  address it on the merits.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4700","title":"Wallace v.

Fudenberg, of\r\n  Mount Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Respondents,\r\n  Timothy Wallace and several members of his family (the Wallaces), filed this\r\n  action against Appellant Lynn Day (Day), seeking damages for breach of a\r\n  contract to purchase a condominium in the Camelot by the Sea Resort in Myrtle\r\n  Beach.Â  Day filed counterclaims for breach of contract, intentional interference\r\n  with contractual relations, and civil conspiracy.Â  The master-in-equity granted\r\n  the Wallaces' summary judgment motion, and Day appeals the master's order.Â  We reverse\r\n  in part and vacate in part the master's order and remand for a full trial on\r\n  the merits.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn February 19, 2005, the\r\n  Wallaces entered into a contract to purchase Dayâ€™s condominium in the Camelot\r\n  by the Sea Resort in Myrtle Beach.[1]Â \r\n  The contract required a closing date of March 18, 2005; however, the parties executed\r\n  an addendum to the contract to extend the closing date to April 6, 2005.Â  The\r\n  parties also executed a separate addendum stating that the Wallaces were &quot;exercising\r\n  a 1031 tax free purchase.&quot;[2]&nbsp; \r\nWhen the April 6th closing date\r\n  arrived, the Wallaces were unable to close the transaction due to problems with\r\n  the loan package.Â  On April 7, Day presented an earnest money release to the\r\n  Wallaces' agent, proposing to return the Wallaces' earnest money.Â  On April 8, the\r\n  Wallaces were ready to close, but Day signed a contract to sell the condominium\r\n  to Steve and Sandra Purwell (the Purwells).Â  On April 18, Day sent a letter to\r\n  her agent authorizing the return of the Wallaces' earnest money and also sent a\r\n  copy of the letter to the Wallaces' agent.Â  On April 21, the Wallaces filed a\r\n  Notice of Lis Pendens as to the condominium.Â  On May 12, Day sent a letter to\r\n  her agent withdrawing the offer to refund the Wallaces' earnest money and also\r\n  sent a copy of the letter to the Wallaces' agent.Â  On that same day, the Wallaces\r\n  filed an Amended Notice of Lis Pendens.Â  Subsequently, the Wallaces filed a Second\r\n  Amended Notice of Lis Pendens on June 2, a Third Amended Notice of Lis Pendens\r\n  on June 22, and a complaint for breach of contract against Day on June 24.Â  The\r\n  Wallaces' complaint sought damages, or, in the alternative, specific performance.Â  \r\nDay filed a\r\n  counterclaim for breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual\r\n  relations, and civil conspiracy.Â  Day sought summary judgment on her breach of\r\n  contract claim; however, the circuit court denied the motion.Â  While Dayâ€™s\r\n  motion for reconsideration was still pending, the parties agreed to a referral\r\n  of the case to the master-in-equity, and the Wallaces filed a summary judgment\r\n  motion.Â  Subsequently, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts.Â  After\r\n  the circuit court denied Dayâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the master granted\r\n  the Wallacesâ€™ summary judgment motion and dismissed Day's breach of contract\r\n  counterclaim.Â  Although the Wallaces' summary judgment motion was originally\r\n  limited to their cause of action for specific performance, they later elected\r\n  to proceed on their cause of action for breach of contract. Â In his final\r\n  order, the master awarded the Wallaces $65,000 for the difference between the condominium's\r\n  market price and contract price at the time of Day's alleged breach and $15,500\r\n  for lost profits, for a total damages award of $80,500.Â  The master also\r\n  awarded the Wallaces $33,749.10 for attorney's fees and costs. Â This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  this Court applies the same standard as that required for the circuit court\r\n  under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688,\r\n  692 (2000).&nbsp; &quot;'Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.'&quot;&nbsp; Adamson\r\n    v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 332 S.C. 121, 124, 503\r\n  S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998) (quoting Tupper\r\n    v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487\r\n  S.E.2d 187, 191&nbsp;(1997)).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Summary judgment should be granted\r\n  when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds\r\n  cannot differ.&quot;Â  Pee Dee Stores, Inc. v. Doyle, 381 S.C. 234, 240,\r\n  672 S.E.2d 799, 802&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;However, summary judgment is\r\n  not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to\r\n  clarify the application of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Summary judgment is a\r\n  drastic remedy, which should be cautiously invoked so that no person will be\r\n  improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.&quot;&nbsp; Doe ex rel. Doe v.\r\n    Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 321-22, 548 S.E.2d 854, 857&nbsp;(2001) (citing Baughman\r\n      v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543\r\n  (1991)).\r\n&quot;In determining whether any triable\r\n  issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences must be viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at\r\n  240, 672 S.E.2d at 802.&nbsp; &quot;Thus, the appellate court reviews all\r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a\r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Id. Â Further, &quot;'[s]ummary\r\n  judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary\r\n  facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn from those\r\n  facts.'&quot;Â  Gignilliat v.

Best Capital Corp.,\r\n  341 S.C. at 378, 534 S.E.2d at 692 (2000)).Â Â  Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n&quot;Summary judgment is improper when\r\n  there is an issue as to the construction of a written contract and the contract\r\n  is ambiguous because the intent of the parties cannot be gathered from the four\r\n  corners of the instrument.&quot;Â  Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at 241, 672 S.E.2d\r\n  at 802. Â &quot;The court is without authority to consider parties' secret intentions,\r\n  and therefore words cannot be read into a contract to impart an intent\r\n  unexpressed when the contract was executed.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;Construction\r\n  of an ambiguous contract is a question of fact to be decided by the trier of\r\n  fact.&quot;Â  Id. (citing Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way\r\n    Envtl., Inc., 325 S.C. 231, 234, 482 S.E.2d\r\n    554, 555 (1997)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; The Wallaces' Breach of Contract Claim\r\nDay asserts that the\r\n  master erred in granting summary judgment to the Wallaces on their breach of\r\n  contract claim because he relied on an erroneous interpretation of the parties'\r\n  contract.Â  We conclude that the master erred in granting summary judgment because\r\n  an ambiguity exists in the contract's default provision.Â  \r\nWhen interpreting a contract, a court\r\n  must ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties. Â Chan v.\r\n    Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 289, 395 S.E.2d 731, 734 (Ct. App. 1990). Â To\r\n  determine the intention of the parties, the court &quot;must first look at the\r\n  language of the contract . . . .&quot; Â C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. S.C.

Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586\r\n  (1988).Â  When the language of a\r\n  contract is clear and unambiguous, the determination of the parties' intent is\r\n  a question of law for the court. Â Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328\r\n  S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997). Â Whether an ambiguity exists\r\n  in the language of a contract is also a question of law. Â S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299,\r\n  302-03 (2001).\r\n&quot;A contract is\r\n  ambiguous when the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible of more\r\n  than one interpretation.&quot;Â  McClellanville, 345 S.C. at\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d at 302.Â  &quot;The uncertainty in interpretation can\r\n  arise from the words of the instrument, or in the application of the words to\r\n  the object they describe.&quot;Â  Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at 242, 672 S.E.2d at\r\n  803.&nbsp; &quot;Once the court decides the language is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted\r\n  to show the intent of the parties.&quot; Â McClellanville, 345 S.C. at\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d at 303. Â &quot;The determination of the parties' intent is then\r\n  a question of fact.&quot; Â Id.Â  (emphasis added).\r\nCounsel stated during\r\n  oral arguments that the parties were not arguing the contract's provisions were\r\n  ambiguous.&nbsp; However, the parties presented opposing arguments before the\r\n  trial court and this Court on the interpretation of the contract.Â  The issue of\r\n  a contract's interpretation necessarily subsumes the primary question of\r\n  whether the contract's language is clear or ambiguous, which determines the\r\n  direction our analysis must take:\r\n\r\n\tIt\r\n  is a question of law for the court whether the\r\n  language of a contract is ambiguous. Â Once the court decides the language is\r\n  ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the parties. Â The\r\n  determination of the parties' intent is then a question of fact. Â On the other\r\n  hand, the construction of a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of law for\r\n  the court. \r\n\r\nMcClellanville, 345 S.C. at\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d at 302-03 (citations omitted).Â  Therefore, we have not\r\n  only the authority but also the responsibility to recognize an ambiguity in a\r\n  contract when determining whether the trial court appropriately relied on the\r\n  contract's language in granting summary judgment.Â  The Wallaces' argument to\r\n  the contrary is without merit.[3]\r\nBecause the Wallaces\r\n  dispute Day's interpretation of the contract's default provision, this Court is\r\n  called upon to decide whether the provisions in question are reasonably\r\n  susceptible to more than one interpretation and thus ambiguous.&nbsp; See McClellanville, 345 S.C. at\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d at 302 (&quot;A contract is ambiguous when the terms of the contract are\r\n  reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.&quot;).Â  \r\nHere, paragraph 16 of\r\n  the contract addresses the options available in the event of a party's\r\n  default:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIf\r\n  Buyer or Seller fails to perform any covenant of this Agreement, the other\r\n    may elect to seek any remedy provided by law, including but not limited to\r\n  attorney fees and actual costs incurred (as defined in paragraph 17), or\r\n    terminate this Agreement with a five day written notice.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe Wallaces assert\r\n  that this\r\n  paragraph provides a party with two options when the\r\n  other party is in default:Â  (1) elect to seek any remedy provided by law; or\r\n  (2) terminate the agreement with a five day written notice.Â  They argue that\r\n  Day opted for the second alternativeâ€”terminationâ€”and therefore she was required\r\n  to provide them with a five day written notice.Â  Day, on the other hand, maintains\r\n  that she opted for the first alternativeâ€”electing to seek any remedy provided\r\n  by law.Â  She asserts that this alternative allowed her to treat the contract as\r\n  abandoned by the Wallaces when they failed to close on the designated date and to\r\n  refrain from any further performance without having to provide notice to the\r\n  Wallaces.Â  She argues that because the contract contains multiple provisions emphasizing\r\n  that time is of the essence, the contract expired pursuant to its own terms\r\n  when the Wallaces failed to close by the contract's deadline.Â  She insists that\r\n  under these circumstances, she had no further obligation to the Wallaces.\r\nWe find the terms of\r\n  the contract's default provision to be reasonably susceptible to more than one\r\n  interpretation.Â  Therefore, the determination of the parties' intent at the time\r\n  they executed the contract is a question of fact that should not have been decided\r\n  on summary judgment.Â  See Pee Dee, 381 S.C. at 241, 672 S.E.2d at 802 (holding\r\n  that summary judgment is improper when there is an issue as to the construction\r\n  of a written contract and the contract is ambiguous); McClellanville, 345 S.C. at\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d at 302-03 (holding that a contract is ambiguous when\r\n  the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible to more than one\r\n  interpretation and that once\r\n  the court decides that the language is ambiguous, the determination of the\r\n  parties' intent is then a question of fact).Â  For this reason, we conclude that\r\n  the master erred in granting summary judgment to the Wallaces on their breach\r\n  of contract claim and in dismissing Day's breach of contract counterclaim.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Dismissal\r\n  of Day's Remaining Counterclaims\r\nDay claims the master erred in\r\n  finding that Judge Breeden's May 5, 2006 order reflected her voluntary withdrawal\r\n  of her counterclaims for intentional interference with contractual relations\r\n  and civil conspiracy.[4]Â \r\n  She argues that Judge Breeden's order reflected her withdrawal of her motion\r\n  for summary judgment with respect to those counterclaims.[5]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nJudge Breeden's May 5, 2006 order\r\n  is a form order that begins with the following boilerplate:Â  &quot;IT IS\r\n    ORDERED that the MOTION BE STRUCK FROM THE ACTIVE motion calendar for the\r\n  following reason(s)[.]&quot;Â  The following language was added in handwriting:Â  \r\n\r\n\tDef\r\n  Motion for Summary Judgment:Â  Under Advisement\r\n\tBoth\r\n  Attorneys to submit a proposed order within 10\r\n  days.\r\n\tDefendant\r\n  withdraws the intentional Interference with\r\n  Contractual Relations and Civil Conspiracy.\r\n\tDef\r\n  Motion to Refer:Â  Plaintiff consents to the referral\r\n\r\nThis form order\r\n  was obviously created for striking motions from the active roster, not\r\n  the underlying claims.Â  Viewing the May 5, 2006 order as a whole, we believe it\r\n  indicates that Day was merely withdrawing her summary judgment motion with respect to her counterclaims for intentional interference with contractual\r\n  relations and civil conspiracy and not the counterclaims themselves.Â  This is\r\n  confirmed by the statement of counsel made during the hearing on Day's summary\r\n  judgment motion:Â  &quot;We have also moved for Summary Judgment on our last two\r\n  cause [sic] of action:Â  Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations and\r\n  Civil Conspiracy.Â  And Your Honor, at this particular time . . . I would\r\n  withdraw that motion as to those two causes of action.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nBased on the foregoing, it\r\n  is appropriate to vacate the finding that Day withdrew her\r\n  counterclaims for intentional interference with contractual relations and civil\r\n  conspiracy and to remand those counterclaims for a trial on the merits.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse\r\n  the master's grant of the Wallaces' summary judgment motion as well as his\r\n  dismissal of Day's breach of contract counterclaim.Â  Additionally, we vacate\r\n  the master's finding that Day voluntarily\r\n  withdrew her counterclaims for intentional interference with contractual\r\n  relations and civil conspiracy.Â  All of the parties' respective causes of\r\n  action are remanded for a full trial on the merits.\r\nAccordingly, the master's order\r\n  is\r\nREVERSED IN\r\n  PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.Â  \r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At this time,\r\n  the property was titled in the name of Day's late husband, but Day had\r\n  authority to sign the contract.Â  \r\n[2] See 26\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1031(a)(1) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;No gain or\r\n  loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in\r\n  a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for\r\n  property of like kind [that] is to be held either for productive use in a trade\r\n  or business or for investment.&quot;).\r\n[3] The Wallaces\r\n  contend that neither party argued before the trial court or this Court that any\r\n  contractual provisions were ambiguous, and, therefore, issue preservation rules\r\n  prohibit this Court from recognizing any ambiguities in the contract.\r\n[4] The master's\r\n  order and Day's brief both refer to Judge Breeden's order as being filed on May\r\n  12, 2006, but the date stamp on the order indicates that it was filed on May\r\n  11, 2006.Â  To avoid confusion, we will refer to the order according to the date\r\n  that Judge Breeden signed it, May 5, 2006.\r\n[5] At oral\r\n  arguments, counsel for the Wallaces conceded this point.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4701","title":"Rouvet v.

Rouvet (Husband) and Wife were\r\n  divorced in 1992; pursuant to an agreement incorporated into the divorce decree,\r\n  Husband was required to provide health insurance for the parties' minor son.Â  After\r\n  issuance of the decree, Husband lost his job and consequently lost the\r\n  insurance he had been providing for his son.Â  The Clerk of Court issued a Rule\r\n  to Show Cause in September 2002, based on Wife's pro se affidavit, and scheduled\r\n  a hearing in November 2002.Â  Wife did not appear at that hearing, although she\r\n  did ask the Clerk to issue a second Rule to Show Cause on the same date of the\r\n  hearing, based on a second pro se affidavit.Â  In February 2003, the Honorable\r\n  Jane D. Fender issued an order requiring Husband's attorney, Douglas W.\r\n  MacNeille (MacNeille), and Wife to get together to discuss medical bills.Â \r\n  Judge Fender also found Husband owed Wife one-half of all medical bills.Â  \r\nIn April 2003, the Honorable Robert S. Armstrong heard arguments\r\n  from the parties on Wife's third Rule to Show Cause.Â  Attorney Robert L. Gailliard\r\n  (Gailliard) made his first appearance on Wife's behalf and MacNeille represented\r\n  Husband.Â  Judge Armstrong issued an amended order in August 2003, finding Judge\r\n  Fender had already ordered Husband to pay one-half of the medical expenses.Â \r\n  The court further found Husband in contempt and ordered him to provide proof of\r\n  insurance for the parties' son and to pay or make arrangements to pay the\r\n  outstanding medical bills.Â  Finally, the court directed Wife to execute a\r\n  release so that Husband could communicate with medical providers regarding the\r\n  child's medical conditions.\r\nThereafter,\r\n  Wife's fourth Rule to Show Cause alleged Husband should be held in contempt for\r\n  failure to comply with the prior orders of Judge Fender and Judge Armstrong.Â  Judge\r\n  Fender presided over the fourth Rule to Show Cause. Â Gailliard represented to\r\n  the court that Wife was asking for reimbursement for the child's medical\r\n  expenses, insurance premiums and deductibles, and attorney's fees.Â  In response,\r\n  MacNeille argued that some of the expenses Wife claimed had been paid by\r\n  insurance and that she was not entitled to reimbursement for those amounts.Â \r\n  MacNeille also claimed Wife owed Husband her share of the premium on the\r\n  insurance obtained by Husband.Â  Without taking testimony from either party or\r\n  allowing the parties to present evidence, the judge ordered the parties to\r\n  figure out how much each party owed to the other and to pay it within thirty\r\n  days.Â  \r\nJudge\r\n  Fender signed an order on March 2, 2004, declining to hold Husband in contempt\r\n  (March Order).Â  Judge Fender further ordered Gailliard and MacNeille to meet\r\n  within thirty days to attempt to resolve the dispute; otherwise, each attorney was\r\n  directed to submit a proposed order.Â  Judge Fender retained jurisdiction,\r\n  concluding that the matter would be rescheduled for a final hearing in the\r\n  event the parties were unable to reach an agreement.Â  \r\nGailliard\r\n  faxed a letter to MacNeille in May 2004, asking for $12,834.85 for medical\r\n  expenses incurred for the parties' son between 1993 and 2003.Â  Gailliard\r\n  enclosed a list of expenses incurred, along with Husband's portion of the\r\n  expenses owed.Â  On October 1, 2004, Wife sent a letter to Judge Fender, asking\r\n  the court to intervene and to compel both attorneys to comply with the March\r\n  Order.Â  On December 17, 2004, MacNeille sent a letter and proposed order to\r\n  Judge Fender.Â  On January 5, 2005, Judge Fender signed Husband's proposed\r\n  order, attaching nine exhibits, as a supplemental order (Supplemental Order) to\r\n  the March Order.Â  Wife did not appeal the Supplemental Order.\r\nIn\r\n  the interim between the issuance of the March 2004 Order and the January 2005 Supplemental\r\n  Order, several things occurred that are significant to the litigation.Â  First,\r\n  on October 25, 2004, Dr. L. Randolph Waid, a clinical psychologist at the\r\n  Medical University of South Carolina, signed an affidavit, based in part upon a forensic\r\n  evaluation by Dr. Pamela M. Crawford on January 15, 2004, regarding Wife's\r\n  competency.Â  Additionally, on November 24, 2004, a guardian ad litem was\r\n  appointed to represent Wife in an unrelated civil case in circuit court in\r\n  Charleston County.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  on October 27, 2004, between the issuance of the March Order and the\r\n  Supplemental Order, Gailliard was first placed on an interim suspension and\r\n  then placed on an indefinite suspension in January 2005;[2] as a result, another attorney was appointed to assume responsibility for Gailliard's\r\n  files.Â  After the February 2004 hearing before Judge Fender, Wife filed a new\r\n  summons and complaint seeking increased child support.Â  On December 7, 2004,\r\n  approximately one month before the issuance of the Supplemental Order, the\r\n  family court continued a hearing in the child support matter, specifying that\r\n  that the reason for the continuance was Gailliard's suspension.Â  The record\r\n  does not indicate whether Husband or MacNeille knew about the continuance in\r\n  the other case.Â  However, ten days after the continuance, MacNeille mailed a\r\n  proposed order to Judge Fender with a copy to Gailliard.Â  Wife was not copied\r\n  on MacNeille's correspondence with the family court.\r\nIn\r\n  March 2005, two months after the issuance of the Supplemental Order and a\r\n  little less than six months after Wife's attorney had been suspended from the\r\n  practice of law, Wife filed a pro se motion to appoint a guardian ad litem to\r\n  protect her interests.Â  In April 2005, Judge Fender heard Wife's pro se motion\r\n  as well as Husband's motion to terminate child support.Â  Wife filed an amended\r\n  affidavit on the day of the hearing.Â  Judge Fender denied Wife's motion, holding\r\n  the family court was without jurisdiction to appoint a guardian because\r\n  &quot;jurisdiction properly lies with the Probate Court in the county where the\r\n  party resides.&quot;Â  Further, Judge Fender encouraged Wife to obtain legal\r\n  representation.Â  The order also continued Husband's motion for thirty days.Â \r\n  Wife filed a lengthy pro se motion, asking the court to reconsider its denial\r\n  of her motion for the appointment of a guardian ad litem; however, the record\r\n  does not indicate any disposition of this motion.\r\nJudge\r\n  Armstrong presided over the hearing on Husband's previously continued motion to\r\n  terminate child support.Â  Wife renewed her request to be appointed a guardian\r\n  ad litem.Â  Judge Armstrong specifically directed the Clerk of Court to appoint\r\n  an attorney to appear on behalf of Wife and to act as her guardian ad litem.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  attorney Jaye Jones Elliott (Elliott), appointed as counsel and guardian ad\r\n  litem for Wife, appeared at a hearing regarding Wife's competency.Â  Judge\r\n  Armstrong found Wife was not competent to represent her own interests, basing\r\n  his finding on arguments of counsel and the affidavits from Dr. Waid and Dr.\r\n  Crawford.Â  \r\nElliott\r\n  filed a Rule 60 motion for relief from judgment on Wife's behalf.Â  Elliott also\r\n  filed a motion seeking the disqualification or recusal of Judge Fender,\r\n  alleging that Judge Fender had represented Wife's estranged brother and his spouse\r\n  when Judge Fender was in private practice.Â  Further, Wife alleged Judge Fender\r\n  had shown prejudice and/or bias against Wife, which allegedly resulted in\r\n  decisions or statements that were not based upon information learned from Judge\r\n  Fender's participation in the case.Â  Judge Fender issued an order recusing\r\n  herself from the case, but leaving all prior orders in effect.\r\nBoth\r\n  parties were represented by counsel at the hearing on Wife's Rule 60 motion.Â \r\n  Judge Armstrong specifically found Wife had not shown fraud upon the court\r\n  pursuant to Rule 60(b) so as to warrant granting Wife relief from the\r\n  Supplemental Order.Â  Wife timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or\r\n  amend the order denying relief from judgment and argued the family court failed\r\n  to consider circumstances warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(1), including\r\n  excusable neglect, and erred by relying solely on fraud under Rule 60(b)(3).Â \r\n  Judge Armstrong denied the motion to alter or amend.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in denying her Rule 60 motion and her Rule 59\r\n  motion to alter or amend because:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\tThe Supplemental Order contains findings and/or \r\n\t\t\tconclusions that are false, misleading, and/or have no evidentiary \r\n\t\t\tsupport;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2)\r\n\t\t\tThe actions of preparing, submitting, and/or \r\n\t\t\texecuting the supplemental order resulted in findings and/or \r\n\t\t\tconclusions that nullify, void, and/or violate previous findings \r\n\t\t\tand/or conclusions of the family court;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\tThe Supplemental Order resulted from an alleged ex \r\n\t\t\tparte communication between the family court and Husband's counsel;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4) \r\n\t\t\tAt the time the Supplemental Order was executed and \r\n\t\t\tfiled, Wife was not competent and without legal counsel and/or a \r\n\t\t\tguardian ad litem to adequately protect her interests;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5)\r\n\t\t\tThe Supplemental Order contains an improper award \r\n\t\t\tof attorney's fees and costs in Husband's favor; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(6)\r\n\t\t\tThe totality of the circumstances shows a pattern \r\n\t\t\tof fraud, mistake, misrepresentation, misconduct, inadvertence, \r\n\t\t\tsurprise, and/or excusable neglect.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a motion made pursuant to Rule 60(b) is within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548,\r\n  551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 502 (2006).Â  The appellate standard of review is limited\r\n  to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 551,\r\n  633 S.E.2d at 502-03.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the order of the\r\n  court is controlled by an error of law or where the order is based on factual findings\r\n  that are without evidentiary support.Â  Gainey v. Gainey, 382 S.C. 414,\r\n  423, 675 S.E.2d 792, 797 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nWife\r\n  argues she is entitled to relief from the Supplemental Order because she was\r\n  not competent and she did not have either an attorney or a guardian ad litem to\r\n  adequately protect her interests at the time the order was filed.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nRule\r\n  60(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the\r\n  circumstances where a party may obtain relief from a final judgment, order, or\r\n  proceeding:\r\n\r\n\t(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly\r\n  Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On\r\n  motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his\r\n  legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\r\n  following reasons:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) mistake,\r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n\t\t(2) newly\r\n  discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in\r\n  time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n\t\t(3) fraud,\r\n  misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n\t\t(4) the judgment\r\n  is void;\r\n\t\t(5) the judgment\r\n  has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it\r\n  is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable\r\n  that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP (emphasis\r\n  in original).Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  movant in a Rule 60(b) motion has the burden of presenting evidence proving the\r\n  facts essential to entitle her to relief.&quot;Â  BB&amp;T, 369 S.C. at\r\n  552, 633 S.E.2d at 503.Â  In determining whether to grant relief under Rule\r\n  60(b)(1), the court must consider the following factors:Â  &quot;(1) the\r\n  promptness with which relief is sought; (2) the reasons for the failure to act\r\n  promptly; (3) the existence of a meritorious defense; and (4) the prejudice to\r\n  the other party.&quot;Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 345\r\n  S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  As to the first factor,\r\n  we agree with the finding of the family court that Wife's motion for relief was\r\n  timely made because it was filed within one year of the Supplemental Order.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the second factor, we must evaluate the reasons for Wife's failure to act\r\n  promptly.Â  Wife asserts she is entitled to relief because her attorney was\r\n  suspended at the time of the issuance of the Supplemental Order.Â  Generally,\r\n  &quot;the neglect of the attorney is the neglect of the client, and . . . no\r\n  mistake, inadvertence, or neglect attributable to the attorney can be\r\n  successfully used as a ground for relief, unless it would have been excusable\r\n  if attributable to the client.'&quot;Â  Stearns Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Glenwood\r\n    Falls, LP, 373 S.C. 331, 342, 644 S.E.2d 793, 798 (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Simon\r\n      v. Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 551, 99 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1957)).Â  In addition, lack\r\n  of familiarity with legal proceedings is not an acceptable excuse and the court\r\n  will hold a layman to the same standard as an attorney.Â  Hill v. Dotts,\r\n  345 S.C. 304, 310, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  &quot;'[t]he rule that an attorney's negligence may be imputed to his client\r\n  and prevent the latter from relying on that ground for opening or vacating a\r\n  judgment does not necessarily prevail in the event of the attorney's\r\n  abandonment or withdrawal from the case.'&quot;Â  Graham v. Town of Loris,\r\n  272 S.C. 442, 452, 248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978) (quoting 46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments Â§ 737 (1969)).Â  \r\nIn Stearns,\r\n  the court of appeals found when &quot;an attorney's conduct transcends mere\r\n  neglect and the party seeking relief establishes willful abandonment or\r\n  withdrawal from the case, relief from judgment is available.&quot;Â  Stearns,\r\n  373 S.C. at 342-43, 644 S.E.2d at 799.Â  It is undisputed that Gailliard was\r\n  suspended from the practice of law on October 27, 2004.Â  Nearly two months\r\n  later, Husband's attorney, MacNeille, mailed a proposed order to Judge Fender,\r\n  which he copied to Gailliard but not to Wife, before the court issued the\r\n  Supplemental Order. Â Because Wife's attorney was suspended from the practice of\r\n  law at the time the Supplemental Order was issued, Wife was representing\r\n  herself from the date of the suspension of her counsel. Â See Tobias\r\n    v. Rice, 386 S.C. 306, 312, 688 S.E.2d 552, 554-55 (2010) (Pleicones, J.,\r\n  concurring) (noting that from the moment a litigant's attorney is suspended\r\n  from the practice of law, that litigant acts pro se).Â  \r\nIn Tobias,\r\n  the supreme court set aside a judgment after finding the movant was entitled to\r\n  due process and had not received notice of the proceeding because she\r\n  represented herself after the suspension of her attorney.Â  Id. at 311, 688\r\n  S.E.2d at 554.Â  Similarly, in the present case, Wife did not receive any\r\n  communication from either Husband's attorney, or the court, from the March 2004\r\n  hearing until the date she received a copy of the Supplemental Order in January\r\n  2005.Â  Additionally, Wife attempted to obtain some relief when she sent a\r\n  letter to Judge Fender, asking the court to force the attorneys to comply with\r\n  the March Order, but never received a reply.Â  Wife did not file a motion to\r\n  alter or amend the Supplemental Order or take any other action to contest the\r\n  findings in Husband's proposed order until she was appointed counsel due to\r\n  competency concerns.\r\nRule\r\n  17(c), SCRCP, provides for the appointment of a guardian ad litem to sue or\r\n  defend on behalf of a person who is incompetent.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tWhenever\r\n  a minor or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian,\r\n  committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or\r\n  defend on behalf of the minor or incompetent person. If a minor or incompetent\r\n  person does not have a duly appointed representative he may sue by his next\r\n  friend or by guardian ad litem.\r\n  The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or\r\n  shall make such order as it deems proper for the protection of the minor or\r\n  incompetent person.\r\n\r\nRule 17(c), SCRCP.Â  This rule\r\n  retains the principal provisions of repealed section 15-5-310 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.Â  Rule 17(c), SCRCP Note.\r\nThe\r\n  burden of proving mental incompetency is upon the one seeking to establish it.Â  Rogers v. Nation, 284 S.C. 330, 335, 326 S.E.2d 182, 185 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985).Â  Where a court adjudicates the rights of a person who is not mentally\r\n  competent without appointing a guardian ad litem, any judgment rendered by the\r\n  court adverse to the person who is not competent is defective.Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. McDow, 276 S.C. 509, 511, 280 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1981)\r\n  (based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-310 (repealed)).Â  Before divesting a person who\r\n  is not competent of any rights, a court must proceed in strict compliance with\r\n  the law.Â  Id.Â  In McDow, the supreme court remanded for a\r\n  determination of whether McDow was sufficiently competent to proceed without\r\n  the appointment of a guardian ad litem, after raising the issue of competency ex\r\n    mero motu based on evidence in the record on appeal.Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Dr. Pamela Crawford evaluated Wife in January 2004 as part of a criminal action\r\n  against Wife.Â  Dr. Crawford specifically found Wife was not capable of\r\n  assisting counsel in her defense, noting in her opinion it was unlikely that Wife\r\n  could be restored to competency.Â  Likewise, in October 2004, Dr. Randolph Waid\r\n  found Wife's disruptive psychiatric symptomatology and neurocognitive\r\n  impairments rendered her unable to manage her property and affairs effectively,\r\n  such that she was in need of protection.Â  Although these psychiatric evaluations\r\n  were not presented at the time the Supplemental Order was entered, Wife at this\r\n  time was incompetent to manage her affairs and her attorney was incapable of\r\n  managing her affairs due to his suspension.Â  Because Wife's attorney had been\r\n  suspended, and because Wife was not competent to represent herself, the family\r\n  court abused its discretion by relying solely on the failure to demonstrate fraud,\r\n  and thus erred in not excusing Wife's failure to act when this information was\r\n  presented at the Rule 60 hearing.Â  \r\nConsequently,\r\n  as to the third factor, we find Wife raised a meritorious defense to the\r\n  judgment based on her incompetency and the suspension of her attorney.Â  See id. (holding that where a court adjudicates the rights of an\r\n  unrepresented person who is not competent, any judgment rendered therein is\r\n  defective).Â  &quot;A meritorious defense need not be perfect nor one which can\r\n  be guaranteed to prevail at a trial.&quot;Â  Graham, 272 S.C. at 453, 248\r\n  S.E.2d at 599.Â  Wife did not have notice of Husband's proposed order because it\r\n  was mailed to her former attorney.Â  Although Judge Fender may not have been\r\n  aware of the suspension and Wife's new pro se status, the judge's awareness of\r\n  this fact would not change the nature of the communication and lack of notice\r\n  to Wife.\r\nDue\r\n  to that lack of notice, Wife was unable to present a defense to or contest the\r\n  findings in the Supplemental Order.[3]Â \r\n  Wife did not have an opportunity to present evidence and testimony to refute\r\n  the findings of fact in the Supplemental Order, as a hearing was not held.Â \r\n  Wife was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Husband's witnesses and object\r\n  to the sufficiency of any evidence relied upon by the family court in issuing\r\n  its order.Â  Accordingly, due to her incompetency, lack of notice and hearing,\r\n  and lack of a guardian, we find Wife is entitled to relief from judgment.[4]Â  See Tobias, 386 S.C. at 311, 688 S.E.2d at 554 (&quot;Accordingly,\r\n  absent notice of the proceedings [the movant] is entitled to relief from\r\n  judgment.&quot;); see also Moore v. Moore, 376 S.C. 467, 473, 657\r\n  S.E.2d 743, 746 (2008) (quoting Clear Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle\r\n    Beach, 372 S.C. 230, 235, 642 S.E.2d 565, 567 (2007) (&quot;Procedural 'due\r\n  process requires (1) adequate notice; (2) adequate opportunity for a hearing;\r\n  (3) the right to introduce evidence; and (4) the right to confront and\r\n  cross-examine witnesses.'&quot;).[5]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court erred in finding only fraud would entitle Wife to\r\n  relief.Â  Based on the fact that Wife was not competent to safeguard her\r\n  interests after the suspension of her attorney, and based on the lack of notice\r\n  to Wife and the failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on the fourth Rule to\r\n  Show Cause before the Supplemental Order was issued, we find Wife is entitled\r\n  to relief from judgment.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the order of the family court is hereby\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.[6]\r\nGEATHERS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Gailliard was conditionally reinstated to the\r\n  practice of law by order of the supreme court dated June 9, 2010.Â  \r\n[3] The law distinguishes trial errors, which occur\r\n  during the presentation of a case and may be quantitatively assessed in the\r\n  context of other evidence, from structural defects, which affect the conduct of\r\n  the trial from beginning to end.Â  LaSalle Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Davidson,\r\n  386 S.C. 276, 280, 688 S.E.2d 121, 123 (2009).Â Â  We find both types of errors\r\n  or defects present in this case.\r\n[4]Â  As to the fourth factor, we conclude Husband has not\r\n  demonstrated any prejudice that he may suffer if the Supplemental Order is\r\n  vacated and remanded for a hearing.Â  Husband, who is representing himself on\r\n  appeal, submitted a brief that consists of a paragraph by paragraph denial of\r\n  the statements in Wife's appellate brief.Â  Unlike Wife, Husband has not\r\n  asserted any reason why he should not be held to the same standard as an\r\n  attorney in presenting his arguments on appeal.Â  See Hill, 345\r\n  S.C. at 310, 547 S.E.2d at 897 (concluding failure to understand the legal\r\n  process is not excusable neglect).Â  \r\n[5] Because Judge Armstrong previously determined Wife\r\n  was not competent to represent her own interests, we need not remand for a\r\n  competency determination as the court did in McDow.Â  \r\n[6] Because we find Wife should be granted relief from\r\n  judgment due to excusable neglect, we need not address Wife's other grounds for\r\n  relief.Â  See Futch v.

Moore, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.:Â  Frank\r\n  Peterson alleges the circuit court erred in granting Charles and Tiffany Porters'\r\n  motion for summary judgment. Â Specifically, Peterson maintains the circuit\r\n  court erred in: (1) finding he was an invitee on the Porters' property; (2)\r\n  holding the Porters did not breach any duty owed to him; (3) failing to include\r\n  in its order those facts that the court found relevant, determinative of the\r\n  issues, and undisputed, sufficient to provide notice as to the rationale\r\n  applied in granting summary judgment; and (4) failing to address evidence that he\r\n  had an employer-employee relationship with the Porters. Â We affirm.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  FACTS\r\n  \r\n  \r\nPeterson performed occasional odd jobs for the Porters around their\r\n  home. Â While Peterson originally worked for the Porters through a\r\n  temporary employment agency, the Porters eventually hired him outside of the\r\n  agency. Â In most instances, Peterson would contact the Porters whenever he\r\n  wanted to earn extra money and offer to do any necessary work around their house\r\n  or yard. Â The Porters paid Peterson $10 an hour, and he worked between\r\n  once a month and six to ten times a year.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn September 13, 2003, Peterson contacted the Porters and asked if\r\n  they needed any work done. Â Charles Porter offered to pay Peterson to pressure wash\r\n  his home, and Peterson agreed.Â  The Porters supplied Peterson with a pressure\r\n  washer, ladder, and wash solution. Â They did not give Peterson specific\r\n  instructions on how to perform the task and did not supervise him. Â Peterson\r\n  admitted he never felt he needed any assistance or supervision while pressure\r\n  washing and he felt safe while doing the work. Â Â Â Peterson was injured\r\n  when he fell 14 feet off of the ladder. Â He was unable to recall how he fell or\r\n  even exactly how the accident happened. Â Peterson could only recall that he was\r\n  partly on the ladder and partly on the roof when he fell.Â  Peterson suffered a severely\r\n  broken leg and underwent several surgeries.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nPeterson filed suit against the Porters alleging the Porters' negligence,\r\n  gross negligence, and negligent supervision proximately caused his injuries. Â In\r\n  his complaint, Peterson alleged the Porters (1) knew or should have known that\r\n  he was not trained to safely perform the task assigned, (2) failed to provide\r\n  him with the proper training and instruction necessary to safely perform the\r\n  task assigned, and (3) failed to provide the equipment and support necessary to\r\n  safely perform the task.Â  Peterson sought damages for his (1) present and\r\n  physical pain and suffering, (2) present and future mental anguish and shock,\r\n  (3) present and permanent disability, (4) pre-trial medical expenses, (5)\r\n  post-trial and future medical expenses, (6) present and future loss of income,\r\n  and (7) loss of future earning capacity.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Porters moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court held the\r\n  Porters were entitled to summary judgment because the facts of the case did not\r\n  give rise to any liability under South Carolina law.Â  The circuit court\r\n  determined Peterson was an invitee on the Porters' property and the Porters did\r\n  not breach any duty owed to him.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court determined the\r\n  Porters did not provide unsafe equipment to Peterson, nor did they fail to warn\r\n  him of any hidden dangers on their property.Â  The circuit court found the\r\n  record failed to demonstrate the Porters could have reasonably anticipated the\r\n  specific harm Peterson suffered. Â Thereafter, the trial court denied Peterson's\r\n  motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Wilson v. Moseley,\r\n  327 S.C. 144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1997). Â In ruling on a motion for\r\n  summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn\r\n  there from must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Â Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; Employer-Employee\r\n    Relationship\r\n  \r\nPeterson argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding he was an invitee on the Porters' property.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Peterson contends he had an employer-employee relationship with the Porters. Â This\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review. While Peterson raised the\r\n  employer-employee argument in his motion to reconsider, he failed to raise it\r\n  during the summary judgment proceedings; therefore, it is not preserved. Â See McClurg\r\n  v. Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 579-80, 671 S.E.2d 87, 96 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding\r\n  a party may not raise an issue for the first time in a motion to reconsider,\r\n  alter or amend a judgment). Â Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  determination that Peterson was an invitee on the Porters' property.Â \r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp; Breach of Duty\r\n  \r\nPeterson also argues that\r\n  assuming he was a business invitee on the Porters' property, the circuit court erred\r\n  in finding the Porters did not breach any duty owed to him.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court determined\r\n  Peterson was a &quot;workman on the [Porters'] premises for business purposes,&quot;\r\n  and thus, he was an invitee under South Carolina law.Â  A business visitor\r\n  &quot;is an invitee whose purpose for being on the property is directly or\r\n  indirectly connected with business dealings with the owner.&quot;Â  Sims v.\r\n  Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 717, 541 S.E.2d 857, 862 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;A property\r\n  owner owes an invitee or business visitor the duty of exercising reasonable or\r\n  ordinary care for his safety and is liable for injuries resulting from any\r\n  breach of such duty.&quot; Â Sides v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C.\r\n  250, 256, 607 S.E.2d 362, 365 (Ct. App. 2004). Â &quot;The property owner has a\r\n  duty to warn an invitee only of latent or hidden dangers of which the property\r\n  owner has or should have knowledge.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Â &quot;A property owner\r\n  generally does not have a duty to warn others of open and obvious conditions,\r\n  but a landowner may be liable if the landowner should have anticipated the\r\n  resulting harm.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court determined there\r\n  was no evidence of any actionable negligence on the part of the Porters.Â  The\r\n  court found there was no evidence the Porters supplied Peterson with defective equipment\r\n  or that the equipment caused Peterson to fall.Â  Furthermore, the court\r\n  determined there was no evidence of any defect or dangerous condition existing\r\n  on the Porters' property.Â  The court also found the roof's steep slope was an\r\n  open and obvious condition, and, thus, the Porters did not have a duty to warn\r\n  Peterson. Â The court noted there was no evidence anyone had ever fallen\r\n  from the roof or that the Porters had any reason to believe a fall was likely. Â The\r\n  court determined the Porters did not have a duty to instruct or supervise\r\n  Porter in his work and there was no evidence Peterson's lack of education\r\n  prevented him from safely performing his work.Â  Peterson maintains the Porters\r\n  had a duty to warn him of the inherent danger of pressure washing their home. Â Peterson\r\n  also contends the Porters had a duty to provide him instructions for safely\r\n  using the pressure washing equipment and with on-site supervision and guidance\r\n  to mitigate any danger.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;To prevail in a\r\n  negligence action, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a duty of care owed by the\r\n  defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent act or\r\n  omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach.&quot;Â  Platt\r\n  v. CSX Transp., Inc., 379 S.C. 249, 258, 665 S.E.2d 631, 635 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  Here, the Porters owed Peterson the duty of reasonable care and to warn him of\r\n  latent or hidden dangers on their property. Â The record does not contain any\r\n  evidence of dangerous or defective conditions on the Porters' property. Â There\r\n  is no evidence there were any defects associated with the Porters' ladder,\r\n  pressure washer, or roof.Â  Furthermore, Peterson failed to establish that the\r\n  Porters had a duty to give him instructions and supervise his work. Â Peterson\r\n  failed to cite any legal authorities supporting his claim that the Porters had\r\n  a duty to instruct and supervise him. Â Thus, there is no evidence the Porters\r\n  breached the duty of reasonable care owed to Peterson as an invitee. Â Moreover,\r\n  Peterson's negligence claim also fails because he did not produce any evidence\r\n  that the Porters' negligence proximately caused his injuries.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPeterson also maintains the Porters\r\n  had a duty to supervise him and warn him of any dangers on their property due\r\n  to his mental capacity.Â  Peterson argues his intellectual limitations required\r\n  the Porters to provide him with detailed instructions and close supervision. Â Peterson\r\n  was in special education classes in school and has an eighth grade education. Â According\r\n  to a report issued by Vocational Rehabilitation Services, a psychologist\r\n  assessing Peterson determined he was in the &quot;low educable mentally\r\n  handicapped range.&quot; Â However, the record does not demonstrate that\r\n  Peterson's mental capacity required heightened supervision from the Porters or affected\r\n  his ability to safely perform the pressure washing. Peterson admitted he\r\n  understood and was comfortable with the task. Â He testified he never felt he\r\n  needed any assistance or supervision while pressure washing and he felt safe\r\n  while doing the work. Â Peterson had also performed the same type of pressure\r\n  washing for the Porters the week before his accident without incident. Â In\r\n  addition, Peterson had held full-time jobs and had worked for the Porters\r\n  previously without any special supervision.Â  Accordingly, we find Peterson's\r\n  lack of education did not require close supervision or special instructions\r\n  from the Porters, and we affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment.Â \r\n  \r\n  III.&nbsp; Sufficiency of the Circuit\r\n    Court's Order\r\n  \r\nPeterson alleges the circuit\r\n  court erred in failing to include in its order those facts that the court found\r\n  relevant, determinative of the issues, and undisputed. Â He contends the circuit\r\n  court order was not sufficient to provide him with clear notice as to the\r\n  court's rationale for granting summary judgment.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPeterson relies on Bowen v.\r\n  Lee Process Systems, 342 S.C. 232, 536 S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 2000) to support\r\n  his argument. Â In Bowen, this court held:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\t[A] trial court's order on summary judgment must set\r\n  out facts and accompanying legal analysis sufficient to permit meaningful\r\n  appellate review. Such an order must include those facts which the circuit\r\n  court finds relevant, determinative of the issues and undisputed. In doing so,\r\n  the trial court should provide clear notice to all parties and the reviewing\r\n  court as to the rationale applied in granting . . . Â summary judgment.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n342 S.C. at 237-38, 536 S.E.2d at 88-89. Â Peterson\r\n  argues the circuit court order fails to provide the court's rationale for\r\n  granting summary judgment and fails to disclose the relevant facts that the\r\n  court found determinative of the issues. Â The circuit court listed the\r\n  following four legal principles in its order:Â  (1) whether a legal duty exists\r\n  is an issue of law for the trial court to decide, (2) if a legal duty does not\r\n  exist, there can be no breach of that duty and no liability for negligence, (3)\r\n  the common law imposes no duty on a person to act, and (4) a duty can arise by\r\n  statute, contractual relationship, status, property interest, or some other\r\n  special circumstance.[1]Â \r\n  Peterson argues the cases the circuit court uses to support these legal\r\n  principles are factually distinguishable from the present case, and thus, not\r\n  applicable.Â  While the cases cited by the circuit court differ factually from\r\n  the present case, the legal propositions for which they are cited support the\r\n  circuit court's analysis.

(Tidewater), a corporation in\r\n  which Leon E. Fonvielle, II (Chuck), William Robert Morris (Robert), and William\r\n  C. Morris, Jr. (William) were the equal and sole shareholders.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Tidewater and Chuck challenge the special referee's judgment awarding Robert and\r\n  William each $90,897.35 and finding against Tidewater and Chuck on their\r\n  counterclaim.Â  We affirm as modified.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTidewater\r\n  was incorporated in 1995 by Chuck, Robert, and William.Â  It engaged in the\r\n  business of purchasing timber, hiring loggers to cut the timber, and then\r\n  reselling the timber to mills. Â Chuck and Robert operated the corporation,\r\n  while William had minimal involvement.Â  \r\nTidewater's\r\n  initial funding originated from a line of credit obtained from the Bank of\r\n  Greeleyville and secured by William's personal assets.Â  Chuck and Robert did\r\n  not contribute any capital to the start-up of Tidewater.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor\r\n  tax purposes, Chuck, Robert, and William also formed a real estate partnership\r\n  named CRW through which they purchased timberland. Â CRW would frequently make\r\n  improvements to the land that it purchased, and Tidewater provided funding for those\r\n  improvements.Â  When a payment was made on behalf of CRW by Tidewater, it was recorded\r\n  in Tidewater's books as an account receivable from CRW.Â  \r\nAt some\r\n  point, Chuck, Robert, and William purchased a tract of land in Orangeburg\r\n  County (Orangeburg tract), which, according to Chuck, was considered an asset\r\n  of CRW.Â  The funds to purchase the tract were provided through a mortgage loan\r\n  from Williamsburg First National Bank.Â  The Williamsburg First National Bank\r\n  loan was recorded on Tidewater's balance sheet as a long-term liability.Â \r\n  According to William, the shareholders also invested a substantial amount of\r\n  money in improvements to the tract from funds obtained from the Bank of\r\n  Greeleyville.Â  He estimated that, in total, $700,000 was expended on the Orangeburg\r\n  tract.Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2001, Tidewater hired Wanda Poindexter, who has a degree in accounting and decades\r\n  of bookkeeping and accounting experience, to assist with Tidewater's accounting\r\n  needs.Â  Although Dana Watford, Tidewater's secretary, was performing the\r\n  day-to-day bookkeeping for Tidewater, Tidewater wanted Poindexter to check\r\n  Watford's work and to prepare financial statements, something Watford could not\r\n  do.Â  Once a quarter, Poindexter would send financial statements that she had\r\n  prepared for Tidewater to the accounting firm of Burch Oxner Seale for its\r\n  review.Â  The accounting firm never questioned the reliability of any of the\r\n  financial statements prepared by Poindexter.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSometime\r\n  in late 2001 or early 2002, the Orangeburg tract was put up for sale.Â  It\r\n  languished on the market for a while, but, in October or November of\r\n  2002, an Orangeburg man agreed to purchase it for $700,000. Â Â Â \r\nAt\r\n  around that same time, in November 2002, Robert was approached by Poindexter at\r\n  a horse race in Kingstree.Â  Poindexter expressed concern about Tidewater's finances.Â \r\n  She told Robert that the corporation was in financial distress and that if\r\n  something was not done, the corporation might have to declare bankruptcy.Â  Robert\r\n  then called Chuck to discuss the conversation that he had with Poindexter.Â  Chuck\r\n  assured Robert that everything was fine.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  about a month later, in late December 2002, Chuck called Robert and William and\r\n  told them that there was a major problem and that an immediate meeting was\r\n  needed.Â  At the meeting, Chuck warned Robert and William that the\r\n  corporation could not pay the bills and that it faced bankruptcy.Â  He also\r\n  informed them that he was willing to take over the corporation if they wanted\r\n  out.Â Â Â  \r\nEither\r\n  that night or the day after, the shareholders reached an oral agreement that\r\n  Tidewater would be dissolved and that Chuck would retain the right to use\r\n  Tidewater's name in a new venture.Â  The three shareholders also agreed inter\r\n    alia that: (i) Chuck would assume all of Tidewater's liabilities; (ii) Chuck\r\n  would receive all of Tidewater's assets, with the exception that the accounts\r\n  receivable from the loggers would be divided equally among the shareholders as\r\n  collected;[1] and (iii) Chuck would forgive the shareholder debts of Robert and William.Â  \r\nSometime\r\n  thereafter, William engaged in a conversation with Scott Williamson, a Senior\r\n  Vice President at the Bank of Greeleyville, about the dissolution of\r\n  Tidewater.Â  During this conversation, William discussed what he expected out of\r\n  the dissolution agreement.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 30, 2003, the closing on the Orangeburg tract took place.Â  As a result\r\n  of the sale, $491,554.45 was disbursed directly from the proceeds to satisfy\r\n  Williamsburg First National Bank's mortgage on the tract.Â  The remainder was\r\n  deposited into CRW's checking account.Â  A day after the closing, William wrote\r\n  a $175,000 check from CRW's checking account to the Bank of Greeleyville to\r\n  reduce the balance on Tidewater's line of credit.Â  Altogether, Tidewater's\r\n  liabilities were decreased by $666,554.45 ($491,554.45 plus $175,000) as a direct\r\n  consequence of the sale of the Orangeburg tract. Â Â \r\nPoindexter\r\n  accounted for the $666,554.45 reduction in Tidewater's liabilities by first\r\n  extinguishing the account receivable from CRW, which she determined was approximately\r\n  $383,000.Â  She then treated the remaining amount as a contribution from the\r\n  shareholders, dividing it equally among Chuck, Robert, and William.Â  As a\r\n  result, the accounts receivable from Robert and William (i.e., their debts to Tidewater)\r\n  were converted into accounts payable (i.e., liabilities owed by Tidewater to\r\n  them).Â  Poindexter testified that she treated things this way because of\r\n  &quot;accounting practice,&quot; not because any of the shareholders told her\r\n  to do so.Â  Â Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  on February 15, 2003, Poindexter created a financial statement reflecting the\r\n  corporation's assets and liabilities as of that day.Â  The statement showed an\r\n  account payable to Robert of $61,252.00 and an account payable to William of\r\n  $36,909.13. Â At trial, Poindexter testified that she thought that each of the\r\n  shareholders received the statement.Â  Poindexter's testimony was corroborated\r\n  by Robert, who indicated that the shareholders did indeed receive the\r\n  statement.[2] Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  February 28, 2003, Tidewater was dissolved. Â After the dissolution of\r\n  Tidewater, CRW remained in business for approximately eight months, dissolving\r\n  in October 2003.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  July 2006, Robert and William filed a complaint in circuit court seeking an\r\n  accounting of amounts that they claimed were due to them from Tidewater and Chuck.Â \r\n  Tidewater and Chuck subsequently counterclaimed for an accounting of amounts allegedly\r\n  due to Chuck from Robert and William.Â  The matter was then referred to a\r\n  special referee.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  special referee ultimately awarded Robert and William each $90,897.35 and found\r\n  against Appellants on their counterclaim.Â  In calculating the $90,897.35 figure,\r\n  it appears that the special referee subtracted the account receivable from CRW\r\n  (which he determined was $393,862.39) from the $666,554.45 reduction in\r\n  Tidewater's liabilities that resulted from the sale of the Orangeburg tract.Â  He\r\n  then found that the remaining $272,692.06 constituted a contribution by each\r\n  shareholder of $90,897.35 towards the reduction of Tidewater's debts.Â  Finally,\r\n  the special referee concluded that Robert and William's contributions to Tidewater\r\n  resulted in them being substituted for the banks on the debts owed by Tidewater\r\n  and that, because Chuck assumed the liabilities of Tidewater as of February 28,\r\n  2003, Chuck owed Robert and William each $90,897.35.[3]Â \r\n  Â \r\nTidewater\r\n  and Chuck subsequently filed a motion to amend the judgment pursuant to Rule\r\n  52(b), SCRCP, but it was denied by the special referee after a hearing.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err by failing to find that \r\n\t\t\tTidewater's assets were distributed in accordance with the \r\n\t\t\tshareholder's dissolution agreement?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tAlternatively, must the distribution of the \r\n\t\t\tOrangeburg proceeds be decided in an accounting of CRW rather\r\n  than of Tidewater? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err by excluding the \r\n\t\t\ttestimony of Scott Williamson regarding a statement made to him by \r\n\t\t\tWilliam about Tidewater's dissolution?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.\r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err by finding against \r\n\t\t\tTidewater and Chuck with respect to their counterclaim?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDoes equity require the reversal of the special \r\n\t\t\treferee's judgment?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\n&quot;An action for an accounting sounds in equity.&quot;Â  Historic\r\n  Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 427, 673 S.E.2d 448, 453 (2009).Â \r\n  Accordingly, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.[4] Â Id. Â However, the court &quot;is not required to disregard the factual\r\n  findings of the referee, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better\r\n  position to judge their credibility.&quot;Â  Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C.\r\n  516, 518, 429 S.E.2d 859, 860 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Did\r\n  Chuck Comply with the Shareholders' Dissolution Agreement?\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend that Chuck complied with the shareholders' dissolution agreement and\r\n  that Robert and William were therefore precluded from recovering under an\r\n  accounting cause of action.Â  As explained below, we conclude that Robert and\r\n  William were entitled to recover under an accounting cause of action, but that the\r\n  judgment awarded by the special referee must be modified. \r\nThe\r\n  special referee found, and we agree, that the terms of the dissolution\r\n  agreement were as follows: (i) Chuck would retain the right to use the\r\n  Tidewater name; (ii) accounts receivable from the loggers would be divided\r\n  equally among the shareholders as they were collected; (iii) Chuck would assume\r\n  all other assets of Tidewater; (iv) Chuck would assume all liabilities of\r\n  Tidewater; (v) Chuck would forgive all of the debts of Robert and William; and\r\n  (vi) Chuck would release William from his personal obligation to the Bank of\r\n  Greeleyville on Tidewater's line of credit.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  inquiry, however, is not yet complete; we must still decide what Tidewater's\r\n  liabilities were at the time of its dissolution.[5] Â More specifically, we must determine what, if anything, Tidewater owed Robert\r\n  and William when it dissolved.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the following three accountants testified regarding the amounts owed by Tidewater\r\n  to Robert and William at the time of its dissolution: (i) Poindexter;[6] (ii) Janet Hicks; and (iii) James King.[7]Â \r\n  After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that Poindexter's analysis,\r\n  as evidenced by her February 15, 2003 financial statement, best reflects the\r\n  shareholders' agreement as to those amounts.[8] Â Poindexter, who was employed as Tidewater's accountant at the time, created the\r\n  February 15, 2003 statement specifically for the purposes of Tidewater's dissolution.Â \r\n  She testified that &quot;knowing that the company was going to close, you have to\r\n  have a definition between partners. . . . And at this point with Chuck taking\r\n  over the company, the assets from the company to a new company, I separated\r\n  them out per partner where each individual one would know exactly what was\r\n  being done [to] them or they owed, either way.&quot;Â  Considering that the\r\n  shareholders entered into an agreement in which Chuck agreed to assume all of\r\n  Tidewater's liabilities, it was certainly important to have a document that\r\n  stated exactly what those liabilities were.Â  Furthermore, there is simply no\r\n  evidence that any of the shareholders ever asked Poindexter to modify the\r\n  statement, even though the record indicates that the shareholders received a\r\n  copy of it shortly before Tidewater's dissolution.\r\nWith\r\n  respect to Hicks' analysis of Tidewater's liabilities to Robert and William, we\r\n  do not find it to be persuasive. Â At trial, Hicks introduced Defendant's\r\n  Exhibit 3, which sets forth Hicks' determination as to the assets and\r\n  liabilities of Tidewater at the time of its dissolution.Â  Defendant's Exhibit\r\n  3, which does not list any liabilities owed to Robert, William, or CRW, shows\r\n  that Tidewater's assets exceeded its liabilities by $57,036.22.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Hicks testified that Robert and William were collectively able to walk away from\r\n  liabilities of approximately $120,000 as a result of the dissolution\r\n  agreement.Â  Hicks therefore concluded that, because Chuck received\r\n  approximately $60,000 from the dissolution and Robert and William received a\r\n  benefit worth, on average, $60,000, &quot;no one is due anything and nobody\r\n  owes anybody anything.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nHicks'\r\n  approach has two major weaknesses.Â  First, it is premised upon what Hicks believes is a fair outcome rather than on any real evidence as to the\r\n  shareholders' intent.Â  Significantly, Defendant's Exhibit 3 does not take into\r\n  account intangible assets like the value of Tidewater's name, even though Chuck\r\n  testified that he &quot;didn't want to start over as far as the name goes&quot;\r\n  and that he wanted to keep the Tidewater name because &quot;it was an established,\r\n  reputable name.&quot;Â  Second, Hicks failed to present a clear explanation as to\r\n  how the payments made to Williamsburg First National Bank and the Bank of\r\n  Greeleyville should have been treated on Tidewater's books.Â  For instance,\r\n  while she testified at trial that the payments should have resulted in the account\r\n  receivable from CRW being converted to an account payable, Defendant's Exhibit\r\n  3 does not include an account payable to CRW.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  as to King's analysis, which was relied upon by the special referee, we note\r\n  that the trial transcript contains only two pages of King's testimony and that those\r\n  two pages do not address the amount of Tidewater's liabilities to Robert and\r\n  William.Â  Moreover, while the special referee's order summarizes some of King's\r\n  testimony, it is unclear why King failed to fully accept the approach taken by\r\n  Poindexter in accounting for the payments made to Williamsburg First National\r\n  Bank and the Bank of Greeleyville.Â  Although King appeared to agree with\r\n  Poindexter that the payments resulted in the shareholders each making a\r\n  contribution to Tidewater, King apparently determined that Robert and William's\r\n  existing debts to Tidewater should not have been subtracted from their\r\n  respective contributions.Â  However, we are unable to ascertain why King made\r\n  this latter determination.Â  It is possible that King concluded that Chuck\r\n  forgave William and Robert's shareholder debts before the proceeds from\r\n  the Orangeburg tract were disbursed to Williamsburg First National Bank and the\r\n  Bank of Greeleyville.Â  However, the evidence does not support such a\r\n  conclusion; in fact, it demonstrates just the opposite.Â  In a deposition,\r\n  Robert testified that Chuck told him that &quot;when we pay this stuff off,\r\n  I'll just wash your debt and your daddy's debt clean.&quot;Â  By &quot;when we\r\n  pay this stuff off,&quot; Chuck was apparently referring to using the\r\n  proceeds from the sale of the Orangeburg tract to reduce Tidewater's debt.Â  Thus,\r\n  it does not appear that Chuck intended to forgive Robert and William's shareholder\r\n  debts before Tidewater's debts were reduced by means of the Orangeburg tract\r\n  proceeds.Â  Furthermore, according to the special referee's order, King\r\n  testified that the Orangeburg tract sale changed the relationship between\r\n  Tidewater and the Morrises from that of creditor to debtor.Â  Hence, it appears\r\n  that King believed that Robert and William owed debts to Tidewater at the time\r\n  of the Orangeburg tract sale and that the Orangeburg tract proceeds erased\r\n  those debts. Â Finally, it must be noted that the special referee expressly\r\n  found that Chuck agreed to assume the liabilities of Tidewater as of February\r\n  28, 2003, and there is no evidence in the record that the various portions of\r\n  the agreement (i.e., the assumption of Tidewater's liabilities and the\r\n  extinguishment of Robert and William's debts to Tidewater) were intended to\r\n  become effective at different times.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that Chuck did\r\n  not forgive Robert and William's shareholder debts prior to the disbursement of\r\n  the Orangeburg tract proceeds to Williamsburg First National Bank and the Bank\r\n  of Greeleyville.\r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we find that Poindexter's February 15, 2003 financial statement\r\n  best reflects the amounts owed by Tidewater to Robert and William at the time\r\n  of its dissolution. Â Cf. Bray, 311 S.C. at 497-98, 429 S.E.2d at\r\n  846 (holding, in a partnership accounting action, that the special master properly\r\n  relied upon the accounting analysis offered by the partners' office manager,\r\n  rather than the analysis of a certified public accountant, where the office\r\n  manager's analysis was more consistent with the partners' agreement regarding\r\n  the accounting treatment to be afforded to a partner's payments on a\r\n  partnership loan).Â  As noted above, Poindexter's February 15, 2003 statement\r\n  shows that Tidewater owed liabilities of $61,252.00 and $36,909.13 to Robert\r\n  and William, respectively.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the special referee's\r\n  award of $90,897.35 each to Robert and William must be modified to instead\r\n  award $61,252.00 to Robert and $36,909.13 to William.\r\nII.&nbsp; Must\r\n  the Proceeds from the Sale of the Orangeburg Tract be Disbursed in an\r\n  Accounting of CRW rather than of Tidewater? \r\nAlternatively, Appellants contend that, to the\r\n  extent that the parties intended for Robert and William to have a claim to the proceeds\r\n  of the Orangeburg tract, the proper distribution of those proceeds should have\r\n  been decided in an accounting of CRW, rather than of Tidewater.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  are not persuaded by Appellants' argument.Â  The HUD statement for the sale of\r\n  the Orangeburg tract shows the sellers as being Chuck, Robert, and William in\r\n  their individual capacities, not the partnership entity of CRW.Â  In fact, in\r\n  their brief, Appellants state that the Orangeburg tract was titled in the names\r\n  of Chuck, Robert, and William.[9]Â \r\n  Thus, while the shareholders may have considered the Orangeburg tract to be an\r\n  asset of CRW, it was not legally a CRW asset. Â \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the asset section of the settlement statement for CRW's dissolution does not\r\n  list an account receivable from Tidewater, even though the $666,554.45 reduction\r\n  in Tidewater's debts that resulted from the Orangeburg tract sale exceeded the amount\r\n  then owed by CRW to Tidewater.Â  This telling fact demonstrates that Chuck,\r\n  Robert, and William, each of whom signed CRW's settlement statement, did not think\r\n  CRW was owed anything as a result of the way in which the Orangeburg tract\r\n  proceeds were disbursed. \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we conclude that an accounting of CRW was not legally required to\r\n  properly distribute the Orangeburg tract proceeds.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIII.\r\n\t\tDid the Special Referee Err\r\n  by Excluding Scott Williamson's Testimony Regarding William's Statement to Him\r\n  About the Dissolution of Tidewater?\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp; \r\nNext,\r\n  Appellants contend that the special referee erred by excluding, on hearsay\r\n  grounds, testimony by the Bank of Greeleyville's Scott Williamson that William\r\n  told him that &quot;his main concern [regarding Tidewater's dissolution] was he\r\n  got his property back off the mortgage, that he was released from any personal\r\n  liability, [and] that as long as Chuck was going to assume all the liabilities\r\n  of the company, then he could have the rest of the company as well.&quot;Â  Specifically,\r\n  Appellants argue that this statement was admissible as an admission of a\r\n  party-opponent under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), SCRE.Â  At trial, the special referee\r\n  excluded the statement on the ground that it was hearsay as to Robert.\r\n&quot;'Hearsay'\r\n  is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\r\n  trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.&quot;Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE. Â A statement is\r\n  not hearsay if the statement is &quot;offered against a party and is (A) the\r\n  party's own statement in either an individual or a representative capacity.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE.Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Anders, 331 S.C. 474, 503 S.E.2d 443 (1998), the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court addressed whether a defendant's admission was admissible against another defendant\r\n  under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) where the two defendants were tried in a joint trial.Â \r\n  The court concluded that it was not, explaining:\r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  801(d)(2) provides a statement is an admission if it is &quot;offered against a\r\n  party and is (A) the party's own statement in either an individual or a\r\n  representative capacity . . .&quot; Â The statement here was not Anders'\r\n  &quot;own statement,&quot; and was clearly therefore not admissible as an\r\n  admission against Anders.\r\n\r\nId. at 478 n.4, 503 S.E.2d at 445 n.4 (quoting Rule\r\n  801(d)(2), SCRE).Â  Thus, in the present case, William's statement was not\r\n  admissible against Robert under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) because the statement was not\r\n  Robert's &quot;own statement.&quot;\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  the statement may have been admissible against William.Â  As the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court has explained, &quot;evidence may be admissible against one\r\n  defendant and inadmissible against another.&quot;Â  Jamison v. Howard, 275\r\n  S.C. 344, 349, 271 S.E.2d 116, 119 (1980).[10]Â \r\n  In fact, the supreme court has held that &quot;when a statement is admissible\r\n  against one defendant and not against others, . . . the trial judge must admit\r\n  the statement against the defendant and instruct the jury to disregard it as to\r\n  the other defendants.&quot; Â Player v. Thompson, 259 S.C. 600, 608, 193\r\n  S.E.2d 531, 535 (1972).[11]Â \r\n  Thus, in the present case, because the challenged statement was William's\r\n  &quot;own statement&quot; as contemplated by Rule 801(d)(2)(A), it arguably\r\n  should have been admitted against him. Â Cf. Eberhardt v. Forrester,\r\n  241 S.C. 399, 403-04, 128 S.E.2d 687, 689-90 (1962) (holding, in a civil action\r\n  against the operator and the owners of a vehicle, that the operator's post-collision\r\n  statement regarding the vehicle's brakes was admissible against the operator\r\n  and that the owners were &quot;entitled only to a ruling or instruction\r\n  thereabout&quot;).Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  even if the special referee erred in excluding the statement, we conclude that\r\n  any such error was harmless and therefore does not mandate reversal.Â  See Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 557, 658 S.E.2d\r\n  80, 86 (2008) (&quot;[T]o warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion\r\n  of evidence, the appealing party must show both the error of the ruling and\r\n  prejudice.&quot;).[12]Â \r\n  The statement does not touch upon the critical issue in this case, i.e.,\r\n  whether Tidewater's liabilities at the time of its dissolution included amounts\r\n  owed to Robert and William.Â  Furthermore, the special referee found that the\r\n  shareholders agreed that Chuck would assume Tidewater's liabilities and, in return,\r\n  would have the right to all of its assets, other than the accounts receivable\r\n  from the loggers, which would be divided equally as collected.Â  The only way in\r\n  which the statement conflicts with that finding is that it does not mention the\r\n  division of the accounts receivable from the loggers.Â  However, the special\r\n  referee's finding regarding the accounts receivable from the loggers is not at\r\n  issue in this case.[13] Â Accordingly, we conclude that Appellants did not suffer any prejudice as a\r\n  result of the exclusion of this statement.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the Special Referee Err by Finding Against Appellants on their Counterclaim?\r\nNext,\r\n  Appellants contend that the special referee erred in finding against them with\r\n  respect to their counterclaim.Â  Specifically, they argue that Robert and\r\n  William understated the amounts they withdrew from Tidewater.Â  In making this\r\n  argument, Appellants point to evidence presented by Hicks that purports to show\r\n  Robert's net withdrawals from the corporation totaled $179,857.83, while William's\r\n  totaled $175,256.01.Â  Appellants claim that, because Tidewater's December 31,\r\n  2002 balance sheet shows a shareholder debt of $22,978.46 for Robert and\r\n  $47,689.19 for William, Robert understated his debt to Tidewater by $156,879.37\r\n  and William understated his debt by $127,566.82.Â  Thus, according to\r\n  Appellants, Robert and William collectively understated their debts to\r\n  Tidewater by a total of $284,446.19.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  our review of the entire record, we are not persuaded that the special referee\r\n  erred by finding against Appellants with regard to their counterclaim. Â At\r\n  trial, Hicks presented spreadsheets of numerous &quot;questionable checks and\r\n  deposits&quot; that allegedly demonstrated that Robert and William withdrew net\r\n  sums of $179,857.83 and $175,256.01, respectively, from Tidewater.[14]Â \r\n  However, Hicks did not go through each entry individually and explain why she\r\n  found it questionable. Â Moreover, Hicks' testimony at trial was inconsistent\r\n  with her spreadsheets in that, as noted above, she stated that Robert and\r\n  William &quot;were allowed to walk away from liabilities that approximate $120,000\r\n    in total.&quot; Â According to Hicks' spreadsheets, Robert and\r\n  William's net withdrawals from Tidewater totaled $355,113.84, which is almost\r\n  three times the $120,000 figure.Â  Additionally, the evidence presented by Hicks\r\n  conflicted with testimony provided by Robert and William.Â  For instance, Robert\r\n  testified that, as far as he knew, Tidewater's records accurately reflected the\r\n  amounts that he owed. Â Similarly, William testified that he believed that every\r\n  personal loan that he received from Tidewater was accounted for.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we conclude that Appellants have failed to adequately demonstrate that Robert\r\n  and William collectively understated their debts to Tidewater by a sum of $284,446.19.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  under the terms of the dissolution agreement, Chuck agreed to forgive Robert\r\n  and William's debts to Tidewater.[15]Â \r\n  Moreover, Chuck, who was Tidewater's president and who kept up with Tidewater's\r\n  books, testified that he was aware that unrecorded withdrawals were being taken\r\n  by the Tidewater shareholders, as evidenced by the following exchange between\r\n  him and his attorney:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tWhat\r\n  about loans from the company and that sort of thing?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tWeâ€“theyâ€“they\r\n  were taken.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tExplain\r\n  what you mean when you say they were taken.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tBasically, we didn't operate the company the\r\n  way a company should be operated.Â  Itâ€“there were personal loans taken over the\r\n  whole span that we were [sic] business. . . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tWhenâ€“when you all would take a loan, would it\r\n  get bookedâ€“would it get written up in the company records?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tNo.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tDid\r\n  it sometimes get written in the . . . ?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tSometimes.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThus, assuming arguendo that Robert and William did make some unrecorded withdrawals from Tidewater, it\r\n  appears that Chuck agreed to forgive those amounts as part of the dissolution\r\n  agreement.[16]\r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we conclude that reversal of the special referee's ruling on\r\n  this issue is not warranted.\r\nV.&nbsp; Does Equity Require\r\n  Reversal of the Special Referee's Judgment?\r\nFinally, Appellants contend that equity requires leaving\r\n  the parties in the position they were in before the commencement of the accounting\r\n  action.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Equity\r\n  will allow a party to recover on an enforceable, legal contract as long as the\r\n  right to be vindicated arises under that contract and not under an independent\r\n  illegal agreement.&quot;Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 527, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 541, 542 (1981). Â In the context of an accounting action, this court has\r\n  specifically held that &quot;[h]ardship alone provides no basis for relieving\r\n  one from a contract.&quot; Â Gamble, Givens &amp; Moody v. Moise, 288\r\n  S.C. 210, 218, 341 S.E.2d 147, 151 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  we have concluded that, under the terms of the shareholders' dissolution\r\n  agreement, Robert was entitled to $61,252.00 and William was entitled to $36,909.13.Â \r\n  Appellants have not contended that the dissolution agreement was illegal or\r\n  otherwise unenforceable.[17]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find that Robert and William must\r\n  be awarded the amounts they are entitled to under the dissolution agreement.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we find that the special referee's award of $90,897.35 each to Robert\r\n  and William must be modified to instead award $61,252.00 to Robert and $36,909.13\r\n  to William.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Occasionally,\r\n  Tidewater would advance funds to the loggers to cover their operating costs.Â \r\n  Those funds would then be reimbursed at the time of settlement. \r\n[2] Specifically, Robert\r\n  testified that &quot;once we did theâ€“got the final information there, February\r\n  15th of '03, it showed that we had pretty much overpaid some stuff,\r\n  andâ€“and, you know, that I was due some money from the old company, and my\r\n  father was also due money from the old company.&quot;Â  \r\n[3] Unlike\r\n  Poindexter, the special referee did not subtract William and Robert's existing\r\n  debts from their respective contributions.\r\n[4] &quot;A preponderance of the evidence stated simply is that\r\n  evidence which convinces as to its truth.&quot;Â  Semken v. Semken, 379\r\n  S.C. 71, 75, 664 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\n[5] We agree with\r\n  the special referee's finding that Chuck agreed to assume the liabilities of\r\n  Tidewater as of February 28, 2003, the date it ceased doing business.Â  \r\n[6] According to\r\n  Appellants' reply brief, Poindexter was presented as a fact witness, not an\r\n  expert witness.Â  Nonetheless, this court may still consider her testimony on\r\n  the issue of Tidewater's liabilities to Robert and William.Â  See Bray\r\n    v. Head, 311 S.C. 490, 497-98, 429 S.E.2d 842, 846 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (holding, in an action for dissolution of partnership and division of assets,\r\n  that partner was not required to offer an analysis of partnership accounts by\r\n  an expert witness, but rather could rely upon the testimony of the partners'\r\n  office manager).\r\n[7] The trial\r\n  transcript does not contain the relevant testimony from King.Â  However, as\r\n  discussed below, the special referee's order indicates that King did provide an\r\n  opinion as to the amounts owed by Tidewater to Robert and William when it\r\n  dissolved. \r\n[8] Poindexter's\r\n  February 15, 2003 financial statement is not in the record.Â  However,\r\n  Poindexter testified to the pertinent portions of its contents.Â  \r\n[9] Although Chuck\r\n  testified in a deposition that CRW purchased the Orangeburg tract, the brief submitted\r\n  by him and Tidewater states that the tract was titled in the names of Chuck,\r\n  Robert, and William.Â  \r\n[10] The court is\r\n  cognizant of the fact that Robert and William were plaintiffs here, rather than\r\n  defendants.Â  However, nothing in Jamison suggests that the quoted language\r\n  would be inapplicable to a set of plaintiffs. \r\n[11] The court notes\r\n  that Player was a civil case.Â  In criminal cases, the analysis is generally\r\n  more complicated because of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.Â  See, e.g., State v. Page, 378 S.C. 476, 481, 663 S.E.2d 357, 359 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008) (&quot;The introduction of a nontestifying co-defendant's statement\r\n  which implicates a defendant violates a defendant's right to confrontation\r\n  because no opportunity to cross-examine the co-defendant is presented.Â  Because\r\n  the right to confrontation is so fundamental, limiting instructions are not an\r\n  adequate substitute.&quot;) (citations omitted).Â  Â \r\n[12] Interestingly,\r\n  Appellants state in their reply brief that they &quot;do not request that the\r\n  Court of Appeals reverse on this error alone.&quot; \r\n[13] The special\r\n  referee found that Chuck had paid all sums of money collected from the accounts\r\n  receivable of the loggers.Â  \r\n[14] Interestingly,\r\n  Hicks also testified that Chuck withdrew $102,817.03 from Tidewater.Â  Tidewater's\r\n  December 31, 2002 balance sheet, however, indicates that Chuck did not owe any\r\n  money to Tidewater. Â \r\n[15] Indeed, it\r\n  appears that it was Chuck, rather than Robert or William, who proposed that he\r\n  forgive the Morrises' shareholder debts.Â  \r\n[16] In their reply\r\n  brief, Appellants contend that Chuck did not know the full extent of Robert and\r\n  William's unrecorded withdrawals.Â  However, Appellants' argument is not supported\r\n  by any citation to the record.Â  Under our appellate court rules, we may not\r\n  consider any fact that does not appear in the record.Â  See Rule 210(h),\r\n  SCACR.\r\n[17] In fact, as\r\n  noted above, one of Appellants' arguments on appeal is that Respondents cannot\r\n  recover under an accounting cause of action because Chuck distributed\r\n  Tidewater's assets in accordance with the dissolution agreement.Â  Thus,\r\n  Appellants appear to view the dissolution agreement as an enforceable\r\n  contract.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4704","title":"State v.

Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: William Randolph Boggs pled guilty to strong arm robbery.Â  Prior to being sentenced, he\r\n  requested credit for the time he served in pretrial detention.Â  The plea judge\r\n  indicated his desire that Boggs not receive credit, and on the sentencing\r\n  sheet, the plea judge did not check the box that would give Boggs credit for\r\n  time served.Â  Boggs appeals, arguing he is entitled to receive credit for the\r\n  time he served pursuant to section 24-13-40 of the South Carolina Code (2007).Â \r\n  We agree and modify the sentence to include credit for time served.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nBoggs was charged with armed robbery, and he exercised\r\n  his right to a jury trial.Â  After the trial was underway, the State agreed to\r\n  allow Boggs to plead guilty to strong arm robbery.Â  Boggs pled guilty and\r\n  requested credit for the sixteen-and-a-half months he was detained pretrial.\r\nIn response to this\r\n  request, the plea judge acknowledged being &quot;well aware that section\r\n  24-13-40 says you get credit for the time that you were held awaiting\r\n  sentencing;&quot; however, the judge explained that he was going to request on\r\n  the sentencing sheet that Boggs not receive credit for time served.Â  Boggs's\r\n  attorney argued section 24-13-40 was mandatory, to which the judge replied:\r\n  &quot;I only said request[;] I don't put that in there that he is not to get\r\n  it[.]Â  He is entitled to it by statute . . . . I am aware of all of that.Â  But\r\n  when I don't check it off[,] they don't give him credit[.]Â  I am just telling\r\n  you how it works in the real world.&quot;\r\nThe plea judge\r\n  sentenced Boggs to the maximum sentence of fifteen years.Â  On the sentencing\r\n  sheet, the judge did not check the box notifying the Department of Corrections\r\n  that Boggs was to be given credit for time served.Â  Instead, the judge hand\r\n  wrote on the sentencing sheet: &quot;request that Def not be given credit for\r\n  time served as charge dropped from ar. robbery to st. ar. robbery.&quot;Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSection 24-13-40 of the South Carolina Code (2007) mandates\r\n  prisoners receive credit for the time they served prior to trial unless one of\r\n  two exceptions exists, either: (1) the prisoner\r\n  was an escapee or (2) the prisoner was already serving a sentence on a\r\n  different offense. Â Because the\r\n  language of section 24-13-40 is mandatory, a\r\n  judge cannot deny a defendant credit for time served prior to trial unless one\r\n  of the two exceptions applies.Â  See State v. McCord, 349 S.C.\r\n  477, 487, 562 S.E.2d 689, 694 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nAlthough the State\r\n  acknowledges Boggs should receive credit for the sixteen months he was detained\r\n  pretrial, the State argues that the plea judge did not commit an &quot;error of\r\n  law&quot; because the judge merely made a &quot;precatory request&quot; that\r\n  Boggs would not get credit.Â  We find the plea judge's own comments undermine\r\n  the State's assertion that the request had little significance:Â  &quot;But when\r\n  I don't check [off the box,] they don't give him credit[.]Â  I am just telling\r\n  you how it works in the real world.&quot;Â  Indeed, the online records of the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Corrections indicate Boggs has not been given\r\n  credit for time served because his fifteen-year sentence began to run on April\r\n  7, 2008, the day of his guilty plea, not the day he was first detained on the\r\n  charge.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the plea judge committed an error of law when he denied Boggs credit for\r\n  time served based upon the State's decision to drop the charge from armed\r\n  robbery to strong arm robbery.Â  A judge's disappointment in the maximum\r\n  sentence he can impose is not one of the exceptions to the mandatory language\r\n  in section 24-13-40.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  judge's decision to deny Boggs credit for time served is reversed.[2]Â \r\n  The Department of Corrections shall calculate the credit he is due pursuant to\r\n  section 24-13-40.\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Boggs did not\r\n  appeal his conviction or fifteen-year sentence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4705","title":"Hudson v.

Hudson sustained an injury to her left leg while in the course and scope of\r\n  her employment with Employer for which she received workers' compensation\r\n  benefits.Â  Later, in an order dated October 3, 2001, the single commissioner\r\n  found Hudson permanently and totally disabled based on a combination of\r\n  injuries stemming from her original 1997 work-related injury.Â  Due to the\r\n  combination of her injuries, the single commissioner found Hudson unable to\r\n  perform any kind of work.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Hudson requested a lump-sum payment of her disability award, but Employer and Legion\r\n  objected.Â  After a hearing on the matter, the single commissioner found it was\r\n  in Hudson's best interests to receive the lump-sum payment of her previous\r\n  award.Â  The single commissioner noted that the South Carolina Code vests\r\n  authority in the Workers' Compensation Commission to determine, with discretion,\r\n  whether a lump-sum payment is in an employee's best interest.Â  During the\r\n  pendency of the lump-sum workers' compensation proceedings, Hudson died from\r\n  cancer on June 30, 2002.Â  \r\nEmployer and Legion\r\n  appealed the single commissioner's ruling to the Appellate Panel and argued it\r\n  was error to award Hudson the lump-sum award.Â  Thereafter, the Appellate Panel\r\n  affirmed all of the single commissioner's findings of facts and conclusions of\r\n  law, sustaining his order in its entirety.Â  On July 28, 2003, Legion became\r\n  insolvent.Â  Accordingly, after the ruling regarding the lump-sum payment was\r\n  rendered, the circuit court stayed the appeal due to Legion's insolvency.Â \r\n  During the stay, the Guaranty Association assumed all rights, duties, and\r\n  obligations of Legion as the insolvent insurance carrier pursuant to section\r\n  38-31-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  Thereafter, Employer and the\r\n  Guaranty Association appealed the Appellate Panel's order to the circuit court\r\n  and argued it was error to award the lump-sum award, and the Appellate Panel's\r\n  order must be vacated in light of Hudson's untimely death.Â  \r\nThe Honorable\r\n  Paul E. Short, then a circuit court judge, affirmed the Appellate Panel's order\r\n  in its entirety by written order.Â  The circuit court found substantial evidence\r\n  supported the Appellate Panel's lump-sum award and that the award was not\r\n  inconsistent with section 42-9-301 of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  Concerning\r\n  whether Hudson's death impacted the workers' compensation proceedings, the\r\n  circuit court found this issue was not preserved for review.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  circuit court found Employer and Legion's assertion regarding the abatement of\r\n  Hudson's claim was unpersuasive.Â  Employer and the Guaranty Association appealed\r\n  the circuit court's decision to this court, but they subsequently withdrew the\r\n  appeal.Â  Consequently, our clerk of court signed an order of dismissal and\r\n  remittitur on April 20, 2004. Â Â \r\nAt some point\r\n  during the proceedings, Employer and the Guaranty Association learned of Hudson's\r\n  death and ceased making payments.Â  In response, Kenneth and Keith Hudson, as\r\n  executors of their mother's estate (the Estate), requested payment of the lump-sum\r\n  award.Â  The Hudson sons raised the issue on behalf of Matthew and Andrew Deese,\r\n  Hudson's dependent grandchildren.Â  Specifically, the Estate argued the grandchildren\r\n  were entitled to payment of the lump sum, as Hudson's dependents.Â  Employer and\r\n  the Guaranty Association argued Hudson's lump-sum payment abated upon her death\r\n  and maintained they were not obliged to pay any sum.Â  The single commissioner\r\n  found Judge Short's 2004 order, which addressed Hudson's lump-sum award, could\r\n  not be challenged or relitigated.Â  Specifically, the single commissioner found:\r\n  (1) Hudson's disability award could reasonably fall within section 42-9-10 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009); (2) all of the current beneficiaries had\r\n  colorable claims to the lump-sum proceeds; and (3) the Guaranty Association\r\n  failed to establish abatement under section 42-9-280 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1985).Â  Further, the single commissioner ordered the Guaranty Association to pay\r\n  the lump sum with interest and a ten percent penalty within seven days of the\r\n  order.Â Â Â  \r\nAgain, Employer\r\n  and the Guaranty Association appealed the single commissioner's order.Â  On\r\n  appeal, the Appellate Panel affirmed all of the single commissioner's factual\r\n  findings and legal conclusions with the exception of the ten percent penalty\r\n  imposed.Â  Specifically, the Appellate Panel noted the Guaranty Association did\r\n  not pursue a frivolous defense.Â  Thereafter, the Estate and the Guaranty\r\n  Association cross-appealed to the circuit court.Â  The Honorable Kenneth Goode\r\n  issued an order affirming the Appellate Panel with the exception of the ten percent\r\n  penalty it vacated.Â  In his order, Judge Goode concluded section 42-9-90 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (1985) compelled a penalty; accordingly, he reinstated the\r\n  penalty.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South\r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.&quot; Forrest v. A.S. Price Mech.,\r\n  373 S.C. 303, 306, 644 S.E.2d 784, 785 (Ct. App. 2007). Â &quot;In workers'\r\n  compensation cases, the [Appellate Panel] is the ultimate fact finder.&quot; Â Shealy\r\n    v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000). Â This court\r\n  reviews facts based on the substantial evidence standard. Â Thompson v. S.C.\r\n    Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 877 (Ct. App. 2006). Â Under\r\n  the substantial evidence standard, the appellate court may not substitute its\r\n  judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on\r\n  questions of fact. Â Forrest, 373 S.C. at 306, 644 S.E.2d at 785; see\r\n    also S.C. Code Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2009). Â The appellate court may reverse\r\n  or modify the Appellate Panel's decision only if the claimant's substantial\r\n  rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law\r\n  or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record. Â Forrest, 373 S.C. at 306, 644 S.E.2d at\r\n  785-86.Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor\r\n  evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is\r\n  considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the [Appellate\r\n  Panel] reached.&quot; Â Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Abatement\r\nEmployer and the Guaranty\r\n  Association argue the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's decision\r\n  finding Hudson's lump-sum award survived her death.Â  However, Judge Short's\r\n  order found this issue was not properly before the circuit court in 2004\r\n  because Employer and the Guaranty Association failed to raise it to the\r\n  Appellate Panel after Hudson died.Â  Employer and the Guaranty Association\r\n  appealed Judge Short's ruling but later withdrew the appeal.Â  Thus, we find\r\n  Judge Short's ruling finding the abatement issue unpreserved is the law of the\r\n  case.Â  See Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455, 458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153\r\n  (2009) (&quot;Appellant may not seek relief from the prior unappealed order of\r\n  the circuit court because the order has become the law of the case.Â  Under the\r\n  law-of-the-case doctrine, a party is precluded from relitigating, after an\r\n  appeal, matters that were either not raised on appeal, but should have been, or\r\n  raised on appeal, but expressly rejected by the appellate court.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we decline to address the issue on the merits.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneficiaries/Next of Kin\r\n  Dependents\r\nEmployer argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in failing to address whether all four beneficiaries have\r\n  legitimate claims.Â  The Guaranty Association argues the circuit court erred in affirming\r\n  the Appellate Panel's decision to award Hudson's lump sum to her Estate rather\r\n  than to her beneficiaries pursuant to section 42-9-280 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (1985).Â  In response, the Estate argues Employer and the Guaranty\r\n  Association acknowledged and accepted the beneficiaries' valid and reasonable\r\n  settlement of their respective claims to the lump-sum proceeds. Â Thus, based on\r\n  this stipulation, the Estate argues Employer and the Guaranty Association\r\n  cannot now contest the manner in which the lump-sum award will be distributed.Â \r\n  We agree with Employer and the Guaranty Association. Â \r\nWe disagree with the Estate's\r\n  assertion that Employer and the Guaranty Association acknowledged and accepted\r\n  the beneficiaries' valid and reasonable settlement of their respective\r\n  entitlements to the lump-sum proceeds.Â  On the contrary, during the hearing\r\n  before the single commissioner on January 25, 2005, Employer's counsel\r\n  consistently questioned to whom the lump-sum award should go and the manner of\r\n  the payment.Â  We note there was a discussion among the parties during which\r\n  they agreed to divide the award evenly between Hudson's sons and minor\r\n  grandsons.Â  The single commissioner noted Employer's counsel had no objection\r\n  to the manner in which the funds were split but reserved the right to claim\r\n  that the funds were payable.Â  However, we do not find such a stipulation by\r\n  Employer's counsel on the record and note he stated:Â  &quot;our position is the\r\n  [E]state takes nothing.&quot;Â  Thereafter, Employer and the Guaranty\r\n  Association appealed the single commissioner's decision to award Hudson's lump\r\n  sum to her Estate, rather than to her beneficiaries, to both the Appellate\r\n  Panel and the circuit court.Â  Therefore, we find this issue is properly\r\n  preserved for our review and do not find Employer stipulated to the manner of\r\n  dividing the lump-sum award.Â  Accordingly, we will address this issue on the\r\n  merits. \r\n\r\n  Pursuant to section\r\n    42-9-280:Â  \r\n  When an\r\n    employee receives or is entitled to compensation under this Title for an injury\r\n    covered by the second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 or 42-9-30 and dies from any other\r\n    cause than the injury for which he was entitled to compensation, payment of the\r\n    unpaid balance of compensation shall be made to his next of kin dependent\r\n      upon him for support, in lieu of the compensation the employee would have\r\n    been entitled to had he lived. (emphasis added)\r\n\r\nHere, Hudson's cause of\r\n  death, cancer, was unrelated to her work injury.Â  Pursuant to section 42-9-280,\r\n  the workers' compensation commission must pay the unpaid balance of her\r\n  lump-sum award to her dependent grandchildren rather than to her sons as beneficiaries\r\n  of the Estate.Â  Therefore, we find the circuit court erred in affirming the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision to award Hudson's lump sum to the Estate rather than\r\n  to her beneficiaries pursuant to section 42-9-280 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1985).Â  Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the circuit court's order and\r\n  direct all lump-sum payments to be paid directly to Hudson's dependent\r\n  grandsons.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest Award\r\nNext, Employer and the\r\n  Guaranty Association argue the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate\r\n  Panel's decision to award Hudson's Estate interest on the lump-sum award. Â Specifically,\r\n  the Guaranty Association maintains section 38-31-20(8)(h) (Supp. 2009) of the\r\n  South Carolina Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act disallows\r\n  claims for interest.Â  Section 38-31-20(8) provides: \r\n\r\n  &quot;Covered\r\n    claim&quot; means an unpaid claim, including one of unearned premiums, which\r\n    arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable\r\n    limits of an insurance policy to which this chapter applies issued by an\r\n    insurer, if the insurer is an insolvent insurer and (a) the claimant or insured\r\n    is a resident of this State at the time of the insured event, if for entities\r\n    other than an individual, the residence of a claimant or insured is the state\r\n    in which its principal place of business is located at the time of the insured\r\n    event or (b) the claim is for first-party benefits for damage to property\r\n    permanently located in this State. 'Covered claim' does not include: . . .\r\n      (h) any claims for interest.Â  (emphasis added)\r\n\r\nIn response, the Estate\r\n  points to section 38-31-60 of the South Carolina Code (1985 &amp; Supp. 2009)\r\n  which reveals broad duties owed by the Guaranty Association.Â  We agree with\r\n  Employer and the Guaranty Association on this issue.Â  \r\nSection 38-31-60(b) states\r\n  that the Guaranty Association &quot;is considered the insurer to the extent of\r\n  its obligation on the covered claims and, to this extent, has all\r\n  rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had\r\n  not become insolvent.&quot; Â As we already indicated, interest is not covered.Â \r\n  Accordingly, based on the plain reading of the statute, we reverse the circuit\r\n  court's order affirming the Appellate Panel's decision to award interest.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalty Imposed\r\nFinally, Employer and the\r\n  Guaranty Association argue the circuit court erred in reversing the Appellate\r\n  Panel's decision not to award Hudson's Estate a ten percent penalty.Â  Originally,\r\n  the single commissioner imposed a ten percent penalty under section 42-9-90 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) based on Employer and the Guaranty\r\n  Association's frivolous defense.Â  Thereafter, the Appellate Panel reversed the\r\n  penalty after finding Employer and the Guaranty Association did not pursue a\r\n  frivolous defense.Â  Finally, the circuit court reinstated the penalty and\r\n  relied on Martin v. Rapid Plumbing, 369 S.C. 278, 631 S.E.2d 547 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006).Â  The Estate argues Martin is inapplicable to the facts of their\r\n  case, and therefore, the circuit court erred by reinstating the ten-percent\r\n  penalty.[1]Â Â  \r\nIn response, the Estate\r\n  maintains the circuit court properly found that the ten percent penalty\r\n  pursuant to section 42-9-90 was mandatory.Â  Their reasoning is that Judge Short's\r\n  order was final and should not have been relitigated.Â  Further, the Estate\r\n  maintains that under section 42-9-90, an employer or carrier must prove that\r\n  circumstances beyond their control prevented payment of all compensation owed.Â \r\n  Also, the Estate maintains this section does not afford the Commission any\r\n  discretion when deciding whether to impose a penalty.Â  We agree with the Estate.Â  \r\nSection 42-9-90 provides:\r\n\r\n  If any\r\n    installment of compensation payable in accordance with the terms of an\r\n    agreement approved by the Commission without an award is not paid within\r\n    fourteen days after it becomes due, as provided in Â§ 42-9-230, or if any\r\n    installment of compensation payable in accordance with the terms of an award by\r\n    the Commission is not paid within fourteen days after it becomes due, as\r\n    provided in Â Â Â Â Â§ 42-9-240, there shall be added to such unpaid installment an\r\n    amount equal to ten per cent thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as,\r\n    but in addition to, such installment, unless such nonpayment is excused by the\r\n    Commission after a showing by the employer that owing to conditions over which\r\n    he had no control such installment could not be paid within the period\r\n    prescribed for the payment.\r\n\r\nHere, Employer and the\r\n  Guaranty Association simply stopped paying compensation to the Estate.Â  We\r\n  agree that they had a non-frivolous defense, as the Appellate Panel found.Â \r\n  However, as the single commissioner and Judge Goode found, the imposition of\r\n  the penalty is mandatory under the statute.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit\r\n  court's reinstatement of the ten-percent penalty.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nJudge Short's ruling finding\r\n  the abatement issue unpreserved is the law of the case.Â  Therefore, we decline\r\n  to address this issue on the merits.Â  Pursuant to section 42-9-280 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, we reverse the portion of Judge Goode's order affirming the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision to pay Hudson's remaining lump sum balance to her\r\n  sons as beneficiaries and order the balance be paid to her grandsons as\r\n  beneficiaries.Â  Finally, based on applicable statutes, we reverse the interest\r\n  award and affirm the ten-percent penalty imposed.Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND\r\n  REVERSED IN PART.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We find Martin analogous yet distinguishable\r\n  from the present situation.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4706","title":"Pitts v.

Sowell's Meats &amp;\r\n    Servs., Inc., 327 S.C. 469, 473, 486 S.E.2d 766, 768 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  to the instant case, since the issue of personal jurisdiction in Alabama was\r\n  neither fully litigated nor finally decided, we undertake the jurisdictional\r\n  inquiry suggested in Underwriters Nat'l Assurance Co.Â  When determining\r\n  the validity and effect of a foreign judgment based on lack of personal\r\n  jurisdiction, courts look to the law of the state that rendered the judgment.Â  Fin.\r\n    Fed. Credit Inc., 384 S.C. at 566-67, 683 S.E.2d at 492.Â  Thus, to\r\n  ascertain whether the Alabama court properly exercised jurisdiction over Fink,\r\n  we must consult Alabama law regarding personal jurisdiction. Â \r\nAlabama's\r\n  long-arm rule authorizes the assertion of personal jurisdiction to the limits\r\n  of due process under the federal and state constitutions. Â Leithead v.\r\n    Banyan Corp., 926 So.2d 1025, 1030&nbsp;(Ala. 2005) (noting &quot;Alabama's long-arm 'statute,'\r\n  which is actually Rule 4.2, Ala. R. Civ. P., extends to the limits of due\r\n  process.&quot;).[2] Â Alabama courts have interpreted the due process rights guaranteed under the\r\n  Alabama Constitution to be coextensive with the due process rights guaranteed\r\n  by the United States Constitution.Â  Elliott v. Van Kleef, 830 So.2d 726,\r\n  730 (Ala. 2002).Â  Courts employ a two-pronged test for\r\n  due process.Â  First, the defendant must have certain minimum contacts with the\r\n  forum state.Â  Id. at 730-31 (citing Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington,\r\n  326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).Â  Second, the exercise of jurisdiction over the\r\n  defendant must not offend &quot;traditional notions of fair play and\r\n  substantial justice.&quot;Â  Int'l Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at 316.Â  Under the\r\n  minimum contacts prong, the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum\r\n  state must be &quot;such that [the defendant] should reasonably anticipate\r\n  being haled into court there.&quot;Â  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471\r\n  U.S. 462, 474 (1985).Â  Further, &quot;the minimum contacts test . . . is not\r\n  susceptible of mechanical application; rather, the facts of each case must be\r\n  weighed to determine whether the requisite affiliating circumstances are\r\n  present.&quot;Â  Kulko v. Sup. Ct. of Cal., 436 U.S. 84, 92 (1978)\r\n  (internal quotation omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  level and character of a party's minimum contacts is assessed based on whether\r\n  the contacts are general or specific.Â  Ex Parte Full Circle Distribution,\r\n    L.L.C., 883 So.2d 638, 644 (Ala. 2003).Â  &quot;General contacts, which give\r\n  rise to general personal jurisdiction,\r\n  consist of the defendant's contacts with the forum state that are unrelated to\r\n  the cause of action and that are both 'continuous and systematic.'&quot;Â  Ex\r\n    Parte Phase III Constr., Inc., 723 So.2d 1263, 1266 (Ala. 1998) (Lyons, J.,\r\n  concurring) (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall,\r\n  466 U.S. 408, 414 n.9 (1984)). Â &quot;Specific contacts, which give rise to\r\n  specific personal jurisdiction, consist of the defendant's contacts with the\r\n  forum state that are related to the cause of action.&quot; Â Id. (citing Burger\r\n    King Corp., 471 U.S. at 472-75).Â  &quot;Although the related contacts [for\r\n  specific jurisdiction] need not be continuous and systematic, they must rise to\r\n  such a level as to cause the defendant to anticipate being haled into court in\r\n  the forum state.&quot; Â Id.\r\nBecause\r\n  Fink had no â€œcontinuous and systematicâ€ contacts with Alabama, principles of\r\n  general jurisdiction are not controlling. Â See Helicopteros Nacionales de\r\n    Colombia, S.A., 466 U.S. at 416. Â Thus, we confine our analysis to the nature and extent of Fink's contacts in the context of\r\n  specific jurisdiction. Â In this situation, the jurisdictional inquiry\r\n  must focus on &quot;the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the\r\n  litigation.&quot; Â Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204 (1977). Â Additionally,\r\n  there must exist a clear, firm nexus between the acts of the defendant and the\r\n  allegations forming the basis of the complaint.Â  Duke v. Young, 496\r\n  So.2d 37, 39 (Ala. 1986).Â  Pursuant to that analysis, &quot;[t]he substantial\r\n  connection between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of\r\n  minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully\r\n  directed toward the forum State.&quot;Â  Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Sup. Ct.\r\n    of Cal., 480 U.S. 102, 112 (1987) (internal quotation omitted).Â  &quot;This\r\n  purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled\r\n  into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated\r\n  contacts, or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person.&quot;Â  Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 475 (internal quotations omitted)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  regard to contractual relationships, the United States Supreme Court has\r\n  emphasized &quot;the need for a 'highly realistic' approach that recognizes\r\n  that a 'contract' is 'ordinarily but an intermediate step serving to tie up\r\n  prior business negotiations with future consequences which themselves are the\r\n  real object of the business transaction.'&quot; Id. at 479 (quoting Hoopeston\r\n    Canning Co. v. Cullen, 318 U.S. 313, 316-17 (1943)).Â  &quot;It is these\r\n  factors- prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences, along with\r\n  the terms of the contract and the parties' actual course of dealing- that must\r\n  be evaluated in determining whether the defendant purposefully established\r\n  minimum contacts within the forum.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  these principles to the present case, we find Fink's contacts suffice to meet\r\n  the requirements of personal jurisdiction in Alabama.Â  Fink executed the loan\r\n  agreement as a part-owner of Roundabout Plantation, an Alabama L.L.C., and the\r\n  proceeds of the loan were to be used to construct a golf course and subdivision\r\n  owned and operated by Roundabout Plantation in Alabama.Â  The loan payments were\r\n  also to be made from the proceeds of Roundabout Plantation's Alabama\r\n  operations.Â  By constructing the golf course and subdivision in Alabama from\r\n  the loan proceeds and by traveling to Alabama periodically to oversee its\r\n  operation and to monitor the use of the loan proceeds, Fink established a\r\n  continuing relationship with Alabama in connection with the loan.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the loan agreement was captioned &quot;Houston County, Alabama,&quot; and\r\n  contained an Alabama choice of law provision.Â  In Corporate Waste\r\n    Alternatives, Inc. v. McLane Cumberland, Inc., 896 So.2d 410 (Ala. 2004),\r\n  the Supreme Court of Alabama was presented with the issue of personal\r\n  jurisdiction in a dispute concerning a contract that contained an Alabama\r\n  choice of law provision.Â  There, in contemplation of the ramifications of the\r\n  choice of law provision, the court noted, &quot;the provision in the contract\r\n  stating that the contract would be governed by Alabama law should have further\r\n  alerted [the nonresident defendant] that it might reasonably anticipate being\r\n  haled into court in [Alabama].&quot;Â  Corporate Waste Alternatives, Inc.,\r\n  896 So.2d at 414 (citing Elliott, 830 So.2d at 730) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted).Â  While we recognize that a choice of law provision standing alone\r\n  would be insufficient to confer jurisdiction, it is certainly relevant under\r\n  the facts of this case.Â  See Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 482\r\n  (stating that a choice of law provision is relevant but &quot;such a provision\r\n  standing alone would be insufficient to confer jurisdiction&quot;).Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the caption and choice of law provision, the terms of the agreement itself\r\n  reveal the loan was inextricably linked with Fink's Alabama business.Â  As established\r\n  by the agreement's identification of the &quot;Borrower&quot; as &quot;all\r\n  members of Roundabout Plantation, L.L.C.,&quot; this direct connection to the\r\n  Alabama business resonates throughout the agreement. Â From the subsequent clause\r\n  indicating &quot;Roundabout Plantation, L.L.C. is developing a subdivision and\r\n  golf course in Houston County, Alabama&quot; to the express statement that the\r\n  loan is &quot;for use in the construction and development of the subdivision\r\n  and golf course described hereinabove,&quot; the plain language of the\r\n  agreement established a direct link to Alabama. Â This link is further\r\n  reinforced by the terms of the agreement governing the use of proceeds and payment.\r\n  Â In particular, the agreement designated the proceeds of the loan to be used\r\n  &quot;only for the purposes set forth herein and for the payment of accrued\r\n  interest during the term of this loan&quot; and established the term of the\r\n  loan based on the progress of Roundabout Plantation's Alabama development,\r\n  stating the term of the loan shall be for a period of five years &quot;or until\r\n  such time as fifty (50%) percent of the residential lots contained within the\r\n  Roundabout Plantation, L.L.C. development in Houston County, Alabama shall have\r\n  been sold.&quot;\r\nWith\r\n  specific regard to minimum contacts, Fink's deposition testimony is also\r\n  instructive.Â  In particular, Fink's testimony confirmed that the loan proceeds\r\n  were used for the construction and development of Roundabout Plantation.Â  He further\r\n  testified that he traveled to Alabama on at least twelve occasions over the\r\n  course of two years to monitor the progress of the development. Â For instance,\r\n  Fink testified he visited the golf course on one occasion to check up on the\r\n  profit and loss statements for the canteen.Â  On that visit, Fink spoke with the\r\n  individual who ran the golf course canteen to verify whether the canteen's\r\n  sales were consistent with those in the profit and loss statements.Â  Fink's\r\n  actions in traveling to Alabama for the purpose of monitoring the progress of\r\n  the Alabama development demonstrate a nexus between his undertaking as a part-owner\r\n  of Roundabout Plantation and his responsibilities under the loan agreement.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Fink's actions in furtherance of his obligations as part-owner of Roundabout\r\n  Plantation under the loan agreement were purposely directed toward the forum\r\n  state so as to establish a substantial connection to Alabama.Â  Most notably, Fink's\r\n  conduct with the forum was not the result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated\r\n  contacts, or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person. \r\nIn\r\n  asserting Fink's contacts lacked a firm nexus to the allegations of the\r\n  complaint, Fink relies on Duke v. Young, 496 So.2d 37 (Ala. 1986), and\r\n  its application of the &quot;effects test&quot; outlined in Calder\r\n    v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783\r\n  (1984).Â  These cases are distinguishable. Â In Calder, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court approved a test employed by the California courts for determining personal jurisdiction over nonresident\r\n  defendants who allegedly committed an intentional tort outside the forum. Â Id. at 787. Â Rather than focusing only on the defendant's conduct within or\r\n  contacts with the forum, the &quot;effects test&quot; set forth\r\n  in Calder allows long-arm jurisdiction to be based on the effects within\r\n  the forum of tortious conduct outside the forum. Â Id.Â  Subsequently, in Duke\r\n    v. Young, the Supreme Court of Alabama applied the &quot;effects test&quot;\r\n  articulated in Calder. Â Duke, 496 So.2d at 39. Â There, in finding\r\n  personal jurisdiction was proper, the Duke court, citing Calder,\r\n  noted &quot;[t]he defendants' 'intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions\r\n  were expressly aimed at' Alabama.&quot; Duke, 496 So.2d at 40.Â  While\r\n  courts are split in their interpretation of the breadth of the Calder &quot;effects\r\n  test,&quot; courts unanimously agree the test requires that the defendant\r\n  commit an intentional tort aimed at the forum state.[3] Â See Walker\r\n    v. Biogistics, Inc.,\r\n  2009 WL 856998, 1 (S.D. Ala. 2009) (noting &quot;the 'Calder effects test' for personal jurisdiction requires 'the commission of an intentional\r\n  tort [ ] expressly aimed at a specific individual in the forum whose effects\r\n  were suffered in the forum.'&quot; (quoting Licciardello v. Lovelady,\r\n  544 F.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir. 2008)). Â As the allegations in the complaint in\r\n  the present action remain purely contractual, we find consideration of the\r\n  &quot;effects test&quot; unwarranted.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, based on the language of the loan agreement and Fink's corresponding actions\r\n  purposely directed toward Alabama, we conclude Fink had fair warning of the\r\n  link between the loan and Alabama.Â  Furthermore, as in Burger King and Corporate\r\n    Waste Alternatives, Fink's direct contacts with Alabama in monitoring the\r\n  use of the loan proceeds and the progress of the Alabama development in\r\n  conjunction with the choice of law provision designating the law of Alabama as\r\n  the governing law bolster his deliberate affiliation with Alabama and the\r\n  reasonable forseeability of possible litigation there.Â  See Burger\r\n    King Corp., 471 U.S. at 482 (holding the defendant &quot;'purposely availed\r\n  himself of the benefits and protections of Florida's laws' by entering into\r\n  contracts expressly providing that those laws would govern franchise\r\n  disputes.&quot;); Corporate Waste Alternatives, Inc., 896 So.2d at 414\r\n  (noting &quot;the provision in the contract stating that the contract would be\r\n  governed by Alabama law should have further alerted [the nonresident defendant]\r\n  that it might reasonably anticipate being haled into court in [Alabama].&quot;).Â \r\n  Thus, based on these actions, we conclude Fink's contacts with the state of\r\n  Alabama reasonably suggest Fink should have anticipated being haled into court\r\n  in Alabama.\r\nHaving\r\n  determined the requisite minimum contacts have been established, we now turn to\r\n  whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction comports with &quot;traditional\r\n  notions of fair play and substantial justice.&quot; Â See Int'l Shoe\r\n    Co., 326 U.S. at 316.Â  In addressing this prong, we must consider the\r\n  contacts in light of other factors, such as the burden on the defendant of\r\n  litigating in the forum state, as well as the forum state's interest in\r\n  adjudicating the dispute.Â  Elliott, 830 So.2d at 731. Â Initially, we note Fink has not\r\n  argued on appeal that litigation in Alabama would be unfair or burdensome;\r\n  thus, consideration of this argument is not preserved for review.Â  See Hiller\r\n    Invs. Inc. v. Insultech Group, Inc., 957 So.2d 1111, 1119 (Ala. 2006)\r\n  (holding the court need not analyze whether subjecting the nonresident\r\n  defendant to Alabama's jurisdiction would violate the traditional notions of\r\n  fair play and substantial justice where the nonresident defendant has not\r\n  argued those issues on appeal).\r\nNonetheless,\r\n  were we to reach this issue, we note that Fink submitted to the jurisdiction of\r\n  Alabama in two other foreclosure suits pertaining to Roundabout Plantation.Â \r\n  Specifically, Fink was involved in litigation against Frizzell Construction\r\n  Company concerning the breach of a promissory note; he also was involved in a\r\n  similar action by Peoples Community Bank in 2002.Â  Both actions were maintained\r\n  in Alabama, and Fink did not plead lack of personal jurisdiction in either\r\n  case.Â  Notwithstanding, Fink's numerous contacts with Alabama relative to\r\n  Roundabout Plantation in conjunction with his visits to monitor the progress of\r\n  the development indicate the burden of defending an action in Alabama does not\r\n  rise to the level of being inconsistent with traditional notions of fair play\r\n  and substantial justice.Â  See also World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.\r\n    v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 293 (1980) (noting that &quot;modern transportation\r\n  and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend\r\n  himself in a State where he engages in economic activity.&quot; (quoting McGee\r\n    v. Int'l Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 222-23 (1957))).Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nViewing\r\n  the totality of the facts in the instant case, we find, for purposes of\r\n  personal jurisdiction, Fink maintained sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy\r\n  Alabama's long-arm rule and federal due process.Â  Consequently, the enforcement\r\n  of the Alabama default judgment against Fink in South Carolina was proper.[4]Â  Accordingly, the order of\r\n  the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Effective\r\n  August 1, 2004, Rule\r\n  4.2 was amended and rewritten. Â Rule 4.2, Ala. R. Civ. P. (committee\r\n  comments).Â  The former Rule 4.2 included a &quot;laundry list&quot; of types of\r\n  conduct that would subject an out-of-state defendant to personal jurisdiction\r\n  in Alabama, as well as containing the &quot;catchall&quot; clause now contained\r\n  in the new 4.2(b). Â Id.Â  According to the committee comments to the\r\n  amendment, &quot;[b]ecause the 'catchall' clause has consistently been\r\n  interpreted to go to the full extent of federal due process . . . it is no\r\n  longer necessary to retain the 'laundry list' in the text of the Rule.&quot;Â  Id. Â Likewise, whether we apply the former Rule 4.2 or the new Rule 4.2, our\r\n  analysis of Alabama's long-arm &quot;rule&quot; in the matter at hand remains\r\n  the same.Â Â  \r\n[3] See also Carefirst of Maryland, Inc. v. Carefirst Pregnancy Ctrs., Inc., 334 F.3d\r\n  390, 398 n. 7 (4th Cir. 2003) (stating the &quot;'effects test' of specific\r\n  jurisdiction is typically construed to require that the plaintiff establish\r\n  that: (1) the defendant committed an\r\n    intentional tort; (2) the plaintiff felt the brunt of the harm in the forum,\r\n    such that the forum can be said to be the focal point of the harm; and (3) the\r\n    defendant expressly aimed his tortious conduct at the forum, such that the\r\n    forum can be said to be the focal point of the tortious activity.&quot;).\r\n[4] Fink also\r\n  appeals the amount of attorney's fees awarded in the judgment.Â  Although raised at the\r\n  hearing, we find this issue is not preserved as it was neither ruled upon by\r\n  the circuit court nor raised by way of a post-trial motion to alter or amend.Â  See Elam\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't. of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780\r\n  (2004) (â€œA party must file [a Rule 59(e)] motion when an issue or argument has\r\n  been raised, but not ruled on, in order to preserve it for appellate review.â€)\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  In fact,\r\n  attorney's fees were not even mentioned in the order; thus, even if we were to\r\n  find the amount of fees awarded troubling, the matter is not properly before us\r\n  for review.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
