Diegel, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMOREHEAD, A.J.:Â  Richard Hancock was injured \r\n  while working for his employer on Wal-Martâ€™s premises.Â  Hancock filed suit in \r\n  the circuit court, alleging his injuries were the result of Wal-Martâ€™s negligence.Â  \r\n  The trial judge granted Wal-Martâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation was Hancockâ€™s exclusive remedy.Â  Hancock appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nTru-Wheels, Inc., one of Wal-Martâ€™s vendors, \r\n  employed Hancock.Â  Tru-Wheels provided Wal-Mart with individuals to assemble \r\n  and set up Wal-Mart merchandise in the store.Â Â  Hancock assembled merchandise \r\n  exclusively for Wal-Mart.Â  On a typical day, Hancock would report to the Wal-Mart \r\n  manager and receive instructions about which items to assemble.Â  Hancock assembled \r\n  the items on the Wal-Mart premises and would report any problems to the applicable \r\n  Wal-Mart department manager.Â  Hancock was injured when, in the course of assembling \r\n  riding lawnmowers, a Wal-Mart employee ran over his foot with a forklift.Â  \r\nHancock filed suit in the circuit court, \r\n  alleging his injuries were the result of Wal-Martâ€™s negligence.Â  Wal-Mart filed \r\n  a motion for summary judgment, arguing Hancock was a statutory employee and \r\n  thus had workersâ€™ compensation as his exclusive remedy.Â  The trial judge granted \r\n  the motion, finding Hancock was limited to a workersâ€™ compensation claim because \r\n  he was Wal-Martâ€™s statutory employee. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  However, \r\n  summary judgment is not appropriate where there is no dispute as to the facts \r\n  but the parties dispute the inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts.Â  \r\n  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment \r\n  motion, this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court.â€Â  \r\n  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  â€œOn appeal \r\n  from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all \r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in \r\n  a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€Â  Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Agreement\r\nHancock argues the trial judge erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment without first reviewing the agreement between Tru-Wheels and \r\n  Wal-Mart.Â  \r\nWhile Hancock raised this argument before the trial \r\n  judge, it was not addressed in the final order.Â  Despite this omission, Hancock \r\n  did not file a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for review by this Court.Â  \r\n  See Fraternal Order of Police v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, \r\n  332 S.C. 496, 501, 506 S.E.2d 495, 497 (1998) (holding argument on appeal not \r\n  preserved even where raised to the circuit court because â€œthat court failed \r\n  to rule on the issue and [appellants] failed to call this omission to the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s attention in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motionâ€); Noisette v. Ismail, \r\n  304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding issue was not preserved \r\n  for appellate review where the trial judge did not explicitly rule on the appellantâ€™s \r\n  argument and the appellant made no Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment).Â  \r\n  Regardless, Hancock does not succeed on the merits of this argument.\r\nHancock submitted an affidavit from the \r\n  manager of the Wal-Mart store where the accident occurred.Â  The affidavit states \r\n  â€œWal-Mart has an agreement with Tru-Wheels, Inc. wherein Tru-Wheels, Inc. provides \r\n  workers to set up and assemble various items of merchandise which are sold by \r\n  Wal-Mart.â€Â  Hancock argued at the summary judgment hearing that he had never \r\n  received a copy of the aforementioned agreement, and asked the court to order \r\n  Wal-Mart to produce the agreement.Â  Wal-Mart countered there was only an oral \r\n  agreement between Wal-Mart and Tru-Wheels.Â  Â Â \r\nThere is no evidence in the record that a written agreement \r\n  existed between Wal-Mart and Tru-Wheels.Â  Hancock is merely arguing that the \r\n  Wal-Mart managerâ€™s use of the word â€œagreementâ€ implied there was a written formalization \r\n  of the labor arrangement between Wal-Mart and Tru-Wheels.Â  However, there are \r\n  no exhibits, testimony, affidavits, or evidence to support this contention.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, even viewing this argument in the light most favorable to Hancock, \r\n  we find the trial judge did not err in granting Wal-Martâ€™s motion for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Statutory Employee\r\nHancock argues the trial judge erred in finding \r\n  he was Wal-Martâ€™s statutory employee.Â  Specifically, he contends the product \r\n  that Tru-Wheels delivered to Wal-Mart was Hancockâ€™s labor, and the â€œmere delivery \r\n  of this fungible commodity does not mean Tru Wheels was involved in part of \r\n  Wal-Martâ€™s business.â€Â  Instead, the relationship was between a vendor of labor \r\n  and its customer.Â  As such, Hancock asserts he was not Wal-Martâ€™s statutory \r\n  employee. \r\nCoverage under the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act depends on the existence of an employer-employee relationship.Â  McDowell \r\n  v. Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 41 S.E.2d 872 (1947).Â Â  â€œSouth Carolina \r\n  courts have repeatedly held that determination of the employer-employee relationship \r\n  for workersâ€™ compensation purposes is jurisdictional. Consequently, this Court \r\n  has the power and duty to review the entire record and decide the jurisdictional \r\n  facts in accord with the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Glass v. Dow Chem. \r\n  Co., 325 S.C. 198, 201-02, 482 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1997).Â  \r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act sets forth the circumstances \r\n  that can give rise to a statutory employment relationship.\r\n\r\nWhen any person, in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 and 42-1-430 \r\n  referred to as â€œowner,â€ undertakes to perform or execute any work which is part \r\n  of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (in \r\n  this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 referred to as â€œsubcontractorâ€) for \r\n  the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or \r\n  any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to \r\n  pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Title which \r\n  he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed \r\n  by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (1985).Â  â€œIf a worker \r\n  is properly classified as a statutory employee, his sole remedy for work-related \r\n  injuries is to seek relief under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act; he may not maintain \r\n  a negligence cause of action against his direct employer or his statutory employer.â€Â  \r\n  Neese v. Michelin Tire Corp., 324 S.C. 465, 472, 478 S.E.2d 91, 94 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996), overruled on other grounds by Abbott v. The Limited, Inc., \r\n  338 S.C. 161, 164 n.1, 526 S.E.2d 513, 514 n.1 (2000).Â Â Â Â  \r\nTo determine whether an employee is engaged in \r\n  an activity that is part of the ownerâ€™s trade, business, or occupation as required \r\n  under section 42-1-400, this Court has applied the following three tests:Â  â€œ(1) \r\n  is the activity an important part of the ownerâ€™s business or trade; (2) is the \r\n  activity a necessary, essential, and integral part of the ownerâ€™s business; \r\n  or (3) has the activity previously been performed by the ownerâ€™s employees?â€Â  \r\n  Meyer v. Piggly Wiggly No. 24, Inc., 338 S.C. 471, 473, 527 S.E.2d 761, \r\n  763 (2000).Â  â€œOnly one of these three tests need be met but there is no easily \r\n  applied formula and each case must be decided on its own facts.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œ[T]he guidepost is whether or not that which is being done is or is not a part \r\n  of the general trade, business or occupation of the owner.â€Â  Hopkins v. Darlington \r\n  Veneer Co., 208 S.C. 307, 311, 38 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1946).\r\n In Meyer, the claimant was employed \r\n  by a wholesale bakery that was, in turn, a vendor for a grocery store.Â  Claimantâ€™s \r\n  duties were to stock the shelves with the vendorâ€™s products and clean the display.Â  \r\n  When claimant slipped and fell in the grocery store, he filed an action in tort.Â  \r\n  The Supreme Court concluded claimant was not the grocery storeâ€™s statutory employee \r\n  because his activities on the storeâ€™s premises were â€œrelated only to the sale \r\n  of [v]endorâ€™s goods and were insubstantial in the context of [the grocery storeâ€™s] \r\n  general business.â€Â  Meyer, 338 S.C. at 474, 527 S.E.2d at 763.\r\nWe find the facts of the instant case do not point \r\n  to such a vendor/vendee relationship.Â  Although Hancock characterized the relationship \r\n  as vendor/vendee, that alone is not controlling in the statutory employment \r\n  analysis.Â  See Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. \r\n  313, 322, 523 S.E.2d 766, 770 (1999) (â€œWhatever the parties contract to call \r\n  their relationship is not controlling in a statutory employment analysis.â€).Â  \r\n  Rather, Hancockâ€™s relationship with Wal-Mart satisfies all three of the Meyer \r\n  tests and thus fits the description of a statutory employee.Â  \r\nIn terms of the first test, the Wal-Mart manager, in his \r\n  affidavit, stated Hancockâ€™s duties were a â€œvital and important part of Wal-Martâ€™s \r\n  business in that items always display and sell better once they have been assembled.â€Â  \r\n  As to the second test, the manager also stated Hancockâ€™s duties were â€œa vital \r\n  and integral part of [Wal-Martâ€™s] regular operations.â€ Â Hancockâ€™s deposition \r\n  testimony supports this statement.Â  On a regular basis, Hancock assembled merchandise \r\n  exclusively for Wal-Mart at the store.Â  When he arrived at the store, Hancock \r\n  reported to a Wal-Mart department manager who, in turn, identified the merchandise \r\n  that was to be assembled.Â  Hancock then went to the assembly area where he waited \r\n  for the department employees to bring him the boxes.Â  Upon completion of his \r\n  assigned merchandise, Hancock informed the department manager and turned in \r\n  his itemized work order. Â Regarding the third test, both the Wal-Mart manager \r\n  and Hancock stated that Wal-Mart employees often performed the same assembly \r\n  duties as Hancock.Â  Therefore, under the Meyer analysis, Hancock was \r\n  Wal-Martâ€™s statutory employee, and workersâ€™ compensation is the sole remedy \r\n  for his injuries.Â  See Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 \r\n  S.C. 416, 422, 567 S.E.2d 231, 234 (2002) (holding the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act provides the exclusive remedy for employees who sustain a work-related injury).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in finding Hancock was Wal-Martâ€™s statutory \r\n  employee.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  decision to grant Wal-Martâ€™s motion for summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3646","title":"O'Neal v.

Morgan, Robyn K. Wietecha, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nLaura Puccia Valtorta, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  In this wage payment dispute, \r\n  the trial court trebled the juryâ€™s $1,350 award of damages to plaintiff Betty \r\n  P. Oâ€™Neal and ordered defendant Intermedical Hospital of South Carolina (Intermedical) \r\n  to pay Oâ€™Neal $8,100 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, and reverse in \r\n  part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOâ€™Neal became employed as a registered nurse for \r\n  Intermedical on September 21, 1998.Â  Oâ€™Neal understood that her base pay was \r\n  to be $18.36 per hour with â€œshift differentialâ€ pay of an additional $1.50 per \r\n  hour for night shifts beginning after 11 p.m., and an additional $5.00 per hour \r\n  for weekend shifts.Â  She further understood that she was required to work every \r\n  other weekend. Â \r\nAt some point in her employment, Oâ€™Neal began complaining \r\n  to Teri Hooper, who was in charge of Intermedicalâ€™s payroll, that she was not \r\n  receiving the proper pay.Â  On March 31, 1999, Oâ€™Neal filed a claim against Intermedical \r\n  with the Department of Labor for approximately $681.61 in wages owed.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Oâ€™Neal asserted that between January 9, 1999 and March 20, 1999, Intermedical \r\n  improperly withheld wages for 28.18 regular hours at $18.36 per hour, shift \r\n  differential pay for 17 weekend hours at $5.00 per hour, and shift differential \r\n  pay for 52.82 night hours at $1.50 per hour.Â  \r\nAfter an investigation, the South Carolina Department of \r\n  Labor determined Intermedical failed to comply with the provisions of South \r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40(D) in that it failed to pay Oâ€™Neal $376.09 \r\n  in wages in accordance with her regular pay schedule. \r\n  [1] Â  Nonetheless, the Department of Labor ultimately found that as of March \r\n  25, 1999, Oâ€™Neal had been paid all wages due to her and had in fact been overpaid \r\n  by $110.77.Â  In August of 1999, the Department of Labor assessed a $375.00 penalty \r\n  against the hospital for the late payment of wages.Â  \r\nIn April 1999, Virginia Herring, Intermedicalâ€™s nurse manager, \r\n  created, posted, and distributed copies of the nursesâ€™ working schedule for \r\n  April 11 through May 9, 1999.Â  Herring scheduled Oâ€™Neal to work a number of \r\n  shifts, including a shift beginning at 11:00 p.m. on Friday, April 23, 1999.Â  \r\n  By letter dated April 13, 1999, Oâ€™Neal complained to Herring that her regular \r\n  working schedule of two eight hours shifts and two twelve hour shifts had been \r\n  changed to five eight hour shifts without prior notice.Â  Oâ€™Neal also complained \r\n  that in creating the schedule, Herring failed to consider a prior request for \r\n  vacation and also improperly â€œsplit [her] weekend againâ€ by scheduling her to \r\n  work on Friday, April 23.Â  \r\nOn April 14, Herring and Oâ€™Neal met to discuss the concerns \r\n  Oâ€™Neal expressed in her April 13 letter; however, Herring and Oâ€™Neal dispute \r\n  the content of the discussion.Â  According to Herring, the parties did not discuss \r\n  the 11:00 p.m. April 23 shift during their meeting and Herring did not say or \r\n  do anything during the discussion to give Oâ€™Neal the impression she would remove \r\n  her from the schedule for April 23.Â  Herring further stated she informed Oâ€™Neal \r\n  she could not guarantee the schedule Oâ€™Neal requested in her April 13 letter.Â  \r\n  Oâ€™Neal, on the other hand, asserted, although she remained on the master schedule \r\n  for April 23, Herring removed her from Herringâ€™s personal copy of the schedule \r\n  and assured her she would â€œfixâ€ it.Â  \r\nOâ€™Neal told a number of her co-workers that, although her \r\n  name still appeared on the posted work schedule for the 11:00 shift on April \r\n  23, she would not be working that night because she had discussed the matter \r\n  with Herring and had arranged to have the night off.Â  Based on information the \r\n  other employees relayed to Herring about these comments, Herring approached \r\n  Oâ€™Neal on the morning of April 23 and informed her she was still on the schedule \r\n  and was expected to report to work that night.Â  Oâ€™Neal responded that she would \r\n  not report to work because Herring had already given her the night off and because \r\n  Friday was a weekend night.Â  According to Herring, she explained to Oâ€™Neal that \r\n  the hospitalâ€™s shift/differential pay policy did not apply to scheduling and \r\n  Saturday and Sunday were weekend days for scheduling purposes.Â  Oâ€™Neal argued \r\n  that Friday night shifts constituted weekend work according to the hospitalâ€™s \r\n  policy.Â  Herring reiterated that she expected Oâ€™Neal to report to work that \r\n  night and inquired whether Oâ€™Neal was refusing to do so.Â  Oâ€™Neal confirmed that \r\n  she would not report to work that night.Â  Herring again told Oâ€™Neal she expected \r\n  her to report to work that night.Â  Oâ€™Neal replied, â€œYou do what you gotta do \r\n  and Iâ€™ll do what I gotta do.â€Â  \r\nOâ€™Neal did not, in fact, work on April 23.Â  On April 28, \r\n  1999, Herring called Oâ€™Neal in for a conference, at which time she informed \r\n  Oâ€™Neal her employment with Intermedical was being terminated for insubordination, \r\n  refusal to work a scheduled shift, and unexcused absence from work.Â  \r\nOâ€™Neal instituted the instant action against Intermedical \r\n  on June 1, 1999, alleging (1) wrongful discharge in retaliation for filing a \r\n  claim with the Department of Labor;Â  (2) nonpayment of wages earned during the \r\n  employment relationship including weekend shift differentials, overtime work, \r\n  night hours, and regular hours;Â  (3) and nonpayment of 138.42 hours of accrued \r\n  time off pay due upon her discharge from employment.Â  Oâ€™Neal also sought an \r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Intermedical answered, denying Oâ€™Neal was \r\n  entitled to any of the relief requested in her complaint.Â  Intermedical also \r\n  affirmatively asserted that it acted at all times in good faith and that Oâ€™Nealâ€™s \r\n  own conduct caused all adverse employment action taken against her.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, Intermedical sought and was granted leave \r\n  to amend its pleading to include, as an additional affirmative defense, the \r\n  assertion that Oâ€™Neal breached her duty of loyalty to the hospital. [2] Â  Intermedical also moved for summary judgment on Oâ€™Nealâ€™s claim \r\n  for wrongful discharge.Â  The trial court granted the motion and the trial proceeded \r\n  on the actions for (1) nonpayment of wages due during the employment relationship \r\n  and (2) nonpayment of wages due at the time of termination.Â  \r\nAt trial, Oâ€™Neal asserted the hospital shorted her 28.18 \r\n  hours of regular pay at $18.36 an hour, 17 hours of weekend pay at $5.00 an \r\n  hour, and 52.82 hours of night pay at $1.50 an hour, for a total due of $681.61.Â  \r\n  She also sought 138.42 hours of accrued time off at $18.36 an hour, for a total \r\n  of $2,541.39.Â  Intermedical took the position that although it failed to pay \r\n  Oâ€™Neal all of her wages in a timely manner, the hospital had, by the time of \r\n  her discharge, paid Oâ€™Neal all of the wages she was due during her employment \r\n  at the hospital, including shift differential pay.Â  Intermedical did not dispute \r\n  that Oâ€™Neal had accrued 138.42 hours of time off for which she was not paid \r\n  at the time of her discharge.Â  The hospital sought to establish, however, that \r\n  Oâ€™Neal was terminated for misconduct, in which case the hospitalâ€™s policy prohibits \r\n  payment for accrued time off.Â  In attempting to establish that Oâ€™Nealâ€™s misconduct \r\n  warranted her termination, Intermedical introduced evidence relating to her \r\n  failure to work her scheduled shift on April 23, 1999, as well as other incidents \r\n  such as â€œnodding offâ€ at work and being unfriendly to co-workers.Â  \r\nAt the close of evidence, Intermedical requested that the \r\n  trial court give the following charge to the jury (Defendantâ€™s Request to charge \r\n  No. 10):\r\n\r\nIt is not for you to judge the wisdom or reasonableness of \r\n  any of [Intermedicalâ€™s] business decisions.Â  You cannot require an employer \r\n  to use business practices or policies you prefer or like, nor is it your role \r\n  to second-guess or substitute your judgment for [Intermedicalâ€™s] judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nLikewise, it was [Intermedicalâ€™s] prerogative and right, \r\n  not [Oâ€™Nealâ€™s], to establish relevant criteria and expectations regarding performance \r\n  for any work that [Oâ€™Neal] might have performed, if any, for [Intermedical].\r\n\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury did not include the \r\n  requested language; however, the court charged the jury as follows:\r\n\r\nAmong the fundamental duties of the employee is the obligation \r\n  to yield obedience to all reasonable rules, orders, and instructions of the \r\n  employer and willful or intentional disobedience as a general rule justifies \r\n  dismissal of the employee.\r\nThe employee is bound to obey all of the employerâ€™s lawful \r\n  and reasonable commands even though such commands may under the circumstances \r\n  seem harsh and severe, but the employer has a right to manage his own affairs \r\n  and to establish and enforce any lawful and reasonable policies and instructions \r\n  and it must be a very extreme case in which an employee would be justified in \r\n  refusing to obey those orders.\r\n\r\nIntermedical objected to the trial courtâ€™s failure \r\n  to include the requested charge.Â  The trial court noted the exception, but declined \r\n  to recharge the jury, reasoning that the courtâ€™s original charge sufficiently \r\n  encompassed the requested language.Â  \r\nThe jury returned a $1,350 verdict in favor of \r\n  Oâ€™Neal for wages owed after discharge, but found in favor of Intermedical on \r\n  the action for wages due during the period of employment.Â  \r\nAfter the jury returned its verdict, Oâ€™Neal \r\n  moved for attorneyâ€™s fees and treble damages.Â  By order dated March 9, 2001, \r\n  the trial court granted both motions, trebling the damage award to $4,050 and \r\n  ordering Intermedical to contribute $8,100 toward Oâ€™Nealâ€™s $9,112.50 attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees bill.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Jury Charge\r\nIntermedical asserts the trial court erred in failing to \r\n  instruct the jury in accordance with Defendantâ€™s Request to Charge No. 10. Specifically, \r\n  Intermedical argues the trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury did not adequately \r\n  instruct the jury as to its obligation to apply and enforce Intermedicalâ€™s policies \r\n  regardless of personal preferences or opinions, thereby creating the opportunity \r\n  for the jury to judge the hospitalâ€™s policy on nonpayment for accrued time off \r\n  to employees terminated for misconduct.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe trial judge is required to charge only the current and \r\n  correct law of South Carolina.â€Â  McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, \r\n  306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995).Â  Further, â€œ[r]efusal to give a properly requested \r\n  charge is not error if the general instructions are sufficiently broad to enable \r\n  the jury to understand the law and the issues involved.â€Â  Id.\r\nIntermedical cites two federal cases involving \r\n  employment discrimination in support of its requested jury charge.Â  In Furnco \r\n  Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 578 (1978), the Supreme Court, in \r\n  discussing the Seventh Circuit Court of Appealsâ€™ decision regarding employer \r\n  hiring procedures, stated, â€œCourts are generally less competent than employers \r\n  to restructure business practices, and unless mandated to do so by Congress \r\n  they should not attempt it.â€Â  In Holder v. City of Raleigh, 867 F.2d \r\n  823, 828 (4th Cir.1989), the Court of Appeals, citing Furnco, \r\n  stated, â€œWe have no authority simply to require employers to use the â€˜bestâ€™ \r\n  standards and procedures available to them.â€Â  Neither of these cases embrace \r\n  the specific law as proposed in Intermedicalâ€™s request to charge.Â  Intermedical \r\n  cites no South Carolina law supporting such a charge.Â  \r\nFurther, even if we were to assume the proposed charge was \r\n  the correct and current law of South Carolina, we find no error.Â  Although the \r\n  trial court refused to instruct the jury in exact accordance with Intermedicalâ€™s \r\n  request to charge, the court explicitly instructed the jury that an employee \r\n  is â€œbound to obey all of the employerâ€™s lawful and reasonable commands even \r\n  though such commands may under the circumstances seem harsh and severe.â€Â  The \r\n  court further instructed the jury that â€œthe employer has a right to manage his \r\n  own affairs and to establish and enforce any lawful and reasonable policies \r\n  and instructions . . .â€Â  In our view, the courtâ€™s instructions to the jury sufficiently \r\n  conveyed the concepts that an employer has the right to establish and enforce \r\n  any lawful and reasonable business policies, and an employee is obligated to \r\n  obey the employer, even if an employerâ€™s commands or policies seem harsh or \r\n  severe.Â  Accordingly, we find the instructions were sufficiently broad to enable \r\n  the jury to understand the law and the issues involved.\r\nII.Â  Treble Damages\r\nIntermedical also argues the trial court erred in awarding \r\n  Oâ€™Neal treble damages.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 41-10-80(C) of the South Carolina Wage Payment Act \r\n  provides in part:\r\n\r\nIn case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee as \r\n  required by Section 41-10-40 or 41-10-50 the employee may recover in a civil \r\n  action an amount equal to three times the full amount of the unpaid wages, plus \r\n  costs and reasonable attorney's fees as the court may allow.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2002).Â Â  \r\nIn interpreting this section, our Supreme Court has held \r\n  that the statuteâ€™s explicit provision that the employee â€œmayâ€ recover treble \r\n  damages signifies permission, which generally means that the action spoken of \r\n  is optional or discretionary.Â  The court went on to state as follows:\r\n\r\nThus, by using â€œmayâ€, rather than â€œshallâ€, the legislature \r\n  has provided that the penalty is discretionary with the judge.Â  This interpretation \r\n  accords with the purpose of the Wage Payment Act, to wit:Â  to protect employees \r\n  from the unjustified and wilful retention of wages by the employer.Â  The \r\n  imposition of treble damages in those cases where there is a bona fide dispute \r\n  would be unjust and harsh.\r\n\r\nRice v. Multimedia, Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 98, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  381, 383 (1995) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \r\nSubsequent to Rice, our Supreme Court considered the \r\n  wage withholding case of Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., \r\n  335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999).Â  Futch was employed by McAllister Towing \r\n  (Employer) as a tugboat captain and local manager of its operations in Georgetown.Â  \r\n  After Employer informed Futch his job would terminate at the end of 1993, Futch, \r\n  who knew Employer considered ceasing operations in the area, began making plans \r\n  with a co-worker to start their own tugboat business.Â  After learning of Futchâ€™s \r\n  plans, Employer fired Futch and refused to pay him $4,200 in monthly commissions \r\n  Futch had earned.Â  Futch brought an action against Employer seeking $4,200, \r\n  as well as treble damages and attorneyâ€™s fees, under the Wage Payment Act.Â  \r\n  The jury awarded Futch the full $4,200 sought, and the trial judge trebled the \r\n  damages and awarded Futch attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On appeal, this court reversed, \r\n  holding the trial judge should have granted Employerâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  \r\n  The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed this court, reinstating the \r\n  jury verdict.Â  The court, however, declined to reinstate the award of treble \r\n  damages and attorneyâ€™s fees finding there was a bona fide dispute about whether \r\n  Employer owed Futch any wages.Â  In support of its decision, the court cited \r\n  Rice for the proposition that the â€œimposition of treble damages in cases \r\n  where there is a bona fide dispute would be unjust and harsh, and [the] Legislature \r\n  did not intend to deter litigation of reasonable good faith wage disputes.â€Â  \r\n  Futch, 335 S.C. at 612, 518 S.E.2d at 598.\r\nIn determining the imposition of treble damages was proper \r\n  in the instant case, the trial court reasoned:\r\n\r\nThe Court finds the issue of whether [Intermedical] acted \r\n  in good faith and terminated [Oâ€™Neal] for cause was submitted to the jury.Â  \r\n  The jury determined that [Oâ€™Neal] was entitled to recover accrued time off and \r\n  awarded her a verdict.Â  The jury therefore determined [Intermedical] did not \r\n  terminate [Oâ€™Neal] for cause and thus no good faith basis for refusal to pay \r\n  benefits was established.Â  Accordingly, the Court hereby trebles the jury verdict \r\n  to $4,050.00.Â  \r\n\r\nThe juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Oâ€™Neal does not lend itself \r\n  to the interpretation espoused by the trial court.Â  As evidenced by the decisions \r\n  in Futch and Rice, a finding that an employee is entitled to recover \r\n  unpaid wages is not equivalent to a finding that there existed no bona fide \r\n  dispute as to the employeeâ€™s entitlement to those wages.Â  Further, Intermedical \r\n  did not dispute the number of time off hours Oâ€™Neal had accrued at the time \r\n  she was terminated.Â  Nonetheless, the jury awarded her damages equal to payment \r\n  for only a portion of those hours, indicating the jury determined that Intermedical \r\n  properly withheld payment for the remaining portion of accrued hours.Â  The juryâ€™s \r\n  finding in this regard belies the trial courtâ€™s determination that, based on \r\n  the award of damages, the jury necessarily determined that Intermedical failed \r\n  to establish a good faith basis for refusal to pay the wages at the time of \r\n  Oâ€™Nealâ€™s discharge from employment.Â  Therefore, to the extent the trial court \r\n  found the juryâ€™s verdict was equivalent to a finding that no bona fide dispute \r\n  existed, such finding was erroneous.\r\nAt any rate, our reading of the record convinces us a bona \r\n  fide dispute existed as to whether and to what extent Oâ€™Neal was entitled to \r\n  payment for accrued time off.Â  See The Father v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs., Op. No. 25603 (S.C. Sup.Ct. filed March 10, 2003) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 30-31) (holding, where the decision to impose sanctions is \r\n  to be decided by a judge and not a jury, it sounds in equity rather than law \r\n  such that the South Carolina Constitution mandates the appellate court take \r\n  its own view of the facts).Â  It is undisputed Intermedicalâ€™s policy was to refuse \r\n  payment for accrued time off to employees terminated for misconduct, and Oâ€™Neal \r\n  does not contest the validity of the policy itself.Â  The parties offered contradictory \r\n  testimony as to whether Herring ever agreed to remove Oâ€™Neal from the schedule \r\n  for April 23, 1999.Â  It is undisputed, however, that prior to the scheduled \r\n  shift, Herring made clear to Oâ€™Neal that she was expected to report to work \r\n  at the scheduled time and Oâ€™Neal made a conscious decision not to do so.Â  Further, \r\n  the parties expressed conflicting interpretations of the definition of â€œweekend \r\n  hoursâ€ for purposes of determining whether the terms and conditions of Oâ€™Nealâ€™s \r\n  employment obligated her to work on the disputed date.Â  Thus, we find there \r\n  existed at least a bona fide dispute as to whether Oâ€™Neal was terminated for \r\n  misconduct and, concomitantly, a bona fide disagreement as to whether she was \r\n  entitled to payment for accrued time off.Â  Again, the propriety of treble damages \r\n  under the Wage Payment Act turns not on whether an employer is successful in \r\n  defending against a suit for nonpayment of wages, but whether there existed \r\n  a bona fide dispute concerning payment of the wages.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s award of treble damages is \r\n  reversed and the juryâ€™s original award of damages reinstated.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, Intermedical asserts error in the award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees to Oâ€™Neal.Â  It argues there was a good faith dispute as to \r\n  the wages due Oâ€™Neal and therefore Oâ€™Neal was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  Intermedical further argues, even if Oâ€™Neal was entitled to collect some attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, the lower court awarded her an excessive amount based on the various factors \r\n  for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nWe agree with Intermedical that there was a bona fide dispute \r\n  as to whether Intermedical owed Oâ€™Neal any wages such that the imposition of \r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was also improper pursuant to Futch v. McAllister \r\n  Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) and Rice \r\n  v. Multimedia, Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 456 S.E.2d 381 (1995).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court \r\n  is affirmed as to the jury charge, and reversed as to the award of treble damages \r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON, J., and MOREHEAD, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] South Carolina Code Ann.

Morgan, of Aiken; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Andre D. Tufts appeals his \r\n  conviction for criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, asserting the trial \r\n  judge erred in admitting improper evidence of his character.Â  We affirm.\r\nI.Â  FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nTufts was charged with CSC third as a result of \r\n  an incident that allegedly occurred at Aiken Region Medical Center, where Tufts \r\n  was employed as an orthopedic technician.Â  The victim injured her back and was \r\n  permanently disabled as a result of a fall in 1991.Â  In March of 1997, \r\n  she became incapacitated after performing exercises to build up her strength.Â  \r\n  When she telephoned her physician, he requested that she go to the hospital.Â  \r\n  The victim went to the Emergency Room at Aiken Regional Medical Center and was \r\n  seen by a doctor.Â  After the doctor examined the victim, a nurse gave her a \r\n  shot.Â  When the nurse came back to check on her, Tufts came with her.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, the nurse left, and Tufts remained in the room.Â  According to the \r\n  victim, Tufts represented himself to be an orthopedic doctor and began to examine \r\n  her. Â While examining the victim, Tufts slipped his hands beneath her \r\n  panties and digitally penetrated her.Â  The victim told several nurses what had \r\n  happened and requested that they check Tuftsâ€™s hands for a â€œspecimen.â€Â  When \r\n  the victim returned to her home, she called the police.\r\nThe next day, Detective Dwayne Courtney requested \r\n  that Tufts come to the Aiken Public Safety Department for an interview.Â  During \r\n  the interview, Tufts denied the victimâ€™s allegations.Â  At the conclusion \r\n  of the interview, Tufts exited the public safety building.Â  However, he returned \r\n  to Courtneyâ€™s office a few minutes later and requested to talk to him again.Â  \r\n  During that second interview, Tufts told Courtney that he had been arrested \r\n  and charged in a sexual matter in Augusta, Georgia in 1995 while he worked at \r\n  the University Hospital.Â  When Courtney told Tufts that it sounded like he may \r\n  have a problem, Tufts stated that he knew he had a problem with his sexual desires.Â  \r\n  Tufts then requested that he be allowed to go home and discuss the matter \r\n  with his girlfriend.Â  When Courtney ran a check on Tufts the next day, he discovered \r\n  he had been charged in a similar incident in Georgia that had been nolle \r\n  prossed.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State sought to introduce Courtneyâ€™s \r\n  testimony regarding the two conversations he had had with Tufts. [1] Â  Following in camera testimony from both Courtney and \r\n  Tufts, the trial judge found that the second statement had been voluntarily \r\n  made.Â  After an extensive colloquy with counsel, the trial judge ruled that \r\n  the alleged statement concerning the prior charge in Georgia was inadmissible. \r\n  Â However, he found that the portion of the conversation concerning Tuftsâ€™s \r\n  knowledge that he had a problem with his sexual desires could be construed as \r\n  a confession and was therefore admissible.Â  Immediately after this ruling, \r\n  Detective Courtney testified before the jury.Â  His testimony regarding Tuftsâ€™s \r\n  second statement to him was as follows:\r\nWell, Mr. Tufts put his hands \r\n  into his pockets.Â  He was standing up, and I was standing near my desk.Â  He \r\n  put both hands into his pockets and started to sway from side to side, and hung \r\n  his head down.Â  At that time, he said, that he knew he had a problem with his \r\n  sexual desires, but that he wanted to go home and talk with his girlfriend that \r\n  night, and after he talked to his girlfriend, he would come back to see me on \r\n  the next day, which would have been Friday, and tell me what really happened \r\n  to [the victim] in the emergency room.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Tufts of CSC third, and the \r\n  trial judge sentenced him to six years.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nII.Â  DISCUSSION\r\nTufts contends Detective Courtneyâ€™s testimony constituted \r\n  improper character evidence against him.Â  In support of his argument, Tufts \r\n  relies primarily on State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 501 S.E.2d 716 (1998).Â  \r\n  In Nelson, the supreme court reversed this courtâ€™s decision to affirm \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s conviction.Â  Nelson, who was convicted at trial of four counts of first \r\n  degree CSC with a minor and four counts of lewd act on a child, made post-arrest \r\n  statements to police that he was uncomfortable around adult women and that he \r\n  had fantasies about children.Â  At trial, the judge overruled Nelsonâ€™s objection \r\n  to testimony concerning his fantasies or likes or dislikes of females.Â  The \r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding that Nelsonâ€™s general sexual \r\n  attitudes were not relevant or material to the crime charged because they were \r\n  admitted to show character.Â  Id. at 16, 501 S.E.2d at 724.\r\nThe State argues initially that this issue is not \r\n  preserved for appellate review because the trial judgeâ€™s in camera ruling \r\n  was not a final ruling, citing State v. Shumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d \r\n  859 (1993).Â  Shumpert involved an objection to testimony lodged at an \r\n  in limine ruling that was not repeated when the offending testimony was \r\n  actually offered.Â Â  It is well settled that a ruling on an in limine \r\n  motion is usually not final and the losing party must renew his or her objection \r\n  when the evidence is presented.Â  Id.; State v. Gagum, 328 S.C. \r\n  105, 495 S.E.2d 231 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, where the motion is ruled on \r\n  immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, no further \r\n  objection is necessary.Â  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  231 (Ct. App. 1998); State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 460 S.E.2d 409 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995).Â  Here, it is clear that the trial judgeâ€™s decision, reached after \r\n  in camera testimony, lengthy discussion with counsel, and an overnight \r\n  recess, was a final ruling.Â  Moreover, immediately after the trial judge ruled, \r\n  the State called Detective Courtney to the stand, and he testified in front \r\n  of the jury.Â  Because there was no opportunity for the trial judge to change \r\n  his ruling, we find that Tuftsâ€™s objections prior to the ruling preserved the \r\n  issue for appellate review.\r\nOn the merits, we find the statement was properly \r\n  admitted.Â  Although the trial judge disallowed most of the statements allegedly \r\n  made by Tufts in his second interview with Courtney, he did permit Courtney \r\n  to testify that Tufts told him he had a problem with his sexual desires.Â  This \r\n  statement is similar to the type of evidence presented in Nelson, which \r\n  the supreme court disallowed. There the court stated:Â  â€œGenerally, only those \r\n  parts of a confession or statement made to police which are relevant and material \r\n  to the crime charged should be received into evidence . . . .Â  [W]e find [Nelsonâ€™s] \r\n  general sexual attitudes were not relevant or material to the crime charged \r\n  because they were admitted to show character.â€Â  Nelson, 331 S.C. at 15-16, \r\n  501 S.E.2d at 723-24.Â  \r\nWe believe the circumstances of this case are distinguishable \r\n  from Nelson.Â  In Nelson, the State sought to admit a number of \r\n  toys, tapes of childrenâ€™s shows, storybooks, and photographs of young children.Â  \r\n  Initially, the trial judge thought the offer of evidence was ludicrous.Â  However, \r\n  after the Stateâ€™s expert on sexual trauma testified that pedophiles often maintain \r\n  a large stash of childlike items, the trial judge admitted the evidence.Â  Over \r\n  the defendantâ€™s objection, the trial judge ruled the evidence was probative \r\n  â€œnot of a â€˜character issueâ€™ but of a â€˜personality characteristic,â€™â€ i.e., that \r\n  the defendant was a pedophile.Â  Id. at 5, 501 S.E.2d at 718.Â  \r\nIn addition, the State admitted statements made \r\n  by the defendant to the police.Â  The defendant stated that he was uncomfortable \r\n  around adult women and that he had fantasies about children.Â  The supreme court \r\n  held that the defendantâ€™s general sexual attitudes were admitted only to show \r\n  character.Â  In rejecting the evidence and the defendantâ€™s statements, the court \r\n  stated: â€œâ€˜A necessary corollary to the presumption of innocence is that a defendant \r\n  must be tried for what he did, not for who he is.â€™â€Â  Id. at 15, 501 S.E.2d \r\n  723 (quoting State v. Melcher, 678 A.2d 146, 151 (1996)). \r\nIn Nelson, the offered evidence and the \r\n  defendantâ€™s statements were relevant only to prove that the defendant was a \r\n  pedophile.Â  The fact that the defendant was a pedophile spoke only to his propensity \r\n  to commit the charged offense, and evidence thereof was thus inadmissible.Â  \r\n  In the present case, however, Tuftsâ€™s statements were not admitted to show his \r\n  character; instead, they were admitted as a confession to the specific crime \r\n  charged.Â  \r\nThe trial judge gave much consideration to the \r\n  arguments of counsel and ultimately ruled the statement was admissible because \r\n  he believed the jury could view Tuftsâ€™s statement as a confession.Â  The trial \r\n  judge found that Tuftsâ€™s comment regarding his sexual desires was sufficiently \r\n  related to the officerâ€™s questioning about the specific crime to support the \r\n  inference that Tufts simply chose to convey his confession in that manner.Â  \r\n  The trial judge believed this fact distinguished the statement from mere character \r\n  evidence.Â  As an illustration, the trial judge stated, â€œSo in this context or \r\n  if someone were to say, well I realize that Iâ€™m a murderer and I shouldnâ€™t have \r\n  done it.Â  Thatâ€™s an admission of murder rather than a statement that I have \r\n  a bad character, in this situation.â€Â  The trial judge further stated, â€œIt is \r\n  his way of explaining or justifying to the officer what he is admitting to having \r\n  done . . . .â€Â  Furthermore, Tuftsâ€™s final statement, that he would \r\n  return the next morning to explain what really happened to the victim, definitively \r\n  links his statement to the specific crime charged. \r\nWe agree with the trial judge that Tuftsâ€™s statement \r\n  was not introduced to show his bad character; rather, we believe his statement \r\n  was intended to convey to the officer that he had committed the sexual assault \r\n  on the victim and that he would return the next morning to give the complete \r\n  details of the incident.Â  Certainly, there are many ways in which a suspect \r\n  may choose to implicate himself in a crime.Â  When asked of his guilt, he might \r\n  simply nod affirmatively, or he might offer a complete recounting of the entire \r\n  crime.Â  Here, Tufts returned of his own free will to Courtneyâ€™s office and voluntarily \r\n  offered his statement that he knew he had a problem and that he would return \r\n  the next day to describe what really happened to the victim.Â  In our view, this \r\n  statement was properly admissible as a confession to the charged crime.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Tuftsâ€™s \r\n  conviction is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Tufts did not dispute the first conversation but denied that the \r\n    second conversation had ever taken place.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3648","title":"Walsh v.

Nichols, of Columbia; Kelli Lister Sullivan, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:Â  Frances Dudley Walsh (Frances), \r\n  individually and in her capacity as personal representative of the estate of \r\n  her deceased husband, Jerome J. Walsh (Walsh), brought this action against Walshâ€™s \r\n  former wife, Joyce K. Woods (Joyce). In her complaint, Frances seeks relief \r\n  pertaining to the disposition of surviving spouse benefits made available through \r\n  Walshâ€™s retirement plan.Â  Frances appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  Joyceâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nWalsh married his first wife, Joyce, \r\n  in 1957, and the two separated in 1970. Although they continued to live apart, \r\n  Walsh and Joyce remained married for twenty years after their separation. Â In \r\n  1989, Walsh retired from E.I. Du Pont De Numours And Company (DuPont) after \r\n  approximately forty years of employment.Â  During his tenure at DuPont, Walsh \r\n  participated in a DuPont sponsored pension benefits plan governed by the Employee \r\n  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1001 et. seq. \r\n  (â€œERISAâ€). Contemporaneously with his retirement, Walsh signed a Post Retirement \r\n  Company-Paid Survivor Benefits and Spouse Benefit Option designating Joyce, \r\n  to whom he was still married, as the sole beneficiary of his surviving spouse \r\n  benefits plan in the event he predeceased her. Walshâ€™s monthly benefit was therefore \r\n  reduced by the amount necessary to cover the cost of the survivor benefit plan.Â  \r\n\r\nWalsh and Joyce were divorced by order \r\n  of the family court dated August 24, 1990. Â Incident to the divorce, \r\n  Walsh and Joyce entered into an agreement which the family court approved, adopted, \r\n  and incorporated into the divorce decree.Â  The decree provided, in relevant \r\n  part:\r\n\r\n[T]he parties shall sign whatever documents or other paperwork \r\n  that is necessary to enforce this Agreement.Â  I find that the parties have further \r\n  agreed that each shall retain what .Â  .Â  . retirement plans, pension plans .Â  \r\n  .Â  . etc., that he or she has in his or her possession.Â  If the wife is required \r\n  to sign any papers concerning the husbandâ€™s retirement or benefit options from \r\n  DuPont of Westinghouse, then she shall sign those. \r\n\r\nIt is undisputed Walsh \r\n  never presented Joyce with any documents to sign regarding his retirement benefits, \r\n  and that neither party attempted to obtain a Qualified Domestic Relations Order \r\n  (QDRO) reassigning the surviving spouse benefits during Walshâ€™s lifetime.\r\nOn May 31, 1991, Walsh advised DuPont \r\n  he was divorced from Joyce and desired to change the beneficiary of his pension \r\n  plan to his wife Frances and requested the paperwork to accomplish this \r\n  [1] .Â  In 1994, Walsh married Frances, with whom he had been involved since \r\n  1980. On November 30, 1994, Walsh wrote to DuPont again advising the \r\n  company that he was married to Frances and wished to designate her asÂ  beneficiary \r\n  under his retirement plan, and that the company should send him any documentation \r\n  necessary to effectuate the change in beneficiary.Â  Despite the May 31, 1991 \r\n  letter and other subsequent communications with DuPont wherein Walsh referred \r\n  to Frances as his designated beneficiary, the change Walsh requested \r\n  was never made legally effective.Â  \r\nWalsh died testate on January 27, 1996. Pursuant \r\n  to the terms of Walshâ€™s will, Frances became the sole beneficiary and the Personal \r\n  Representative of his estate.Â  \r\nIn 1997, Frances instituted an \r\n  action against DuPont, which was removed to federal court, seeking a judicial \r\n  finding that Walshâ€™s surviving spouse benefits should be paid to her and not \r\n  Joyce.Â  DuPont moved for and was granted summary judgment on the grounds that \r\n  no QDRO existed terminating Joyceâ€™s right to receive the benefits at the time \r\n  of Walshâ€™s retirement. \r\nThereafter, Frances contacted John W. \r\n  Harte, the attorney who represented Walsh in his divorce from Joyce, and requested \r\n  that he prepare and submit a QDRO to DuPont.Â  Harte prepared the QDRO, then \r\n  contacted Vickie Johnson, the attorney who represented Joyce in the divorce \r\n  action, and requested that she obtain Joyceâ€™s signature on the document. Joyce \r\n  did not sign the QDRO but authorized Johnson to sign it on her behalf.Â  Joyce \r\n  noted on the document, however, that she authorized her signature under protest \r\n  and out of concern she would be held in contempt of court if she refused to \r\n  sign.Â  \r\nIn August of 1998, Harte submitted the \r\n  QDRO to DuPont.Â  In a letter dated September 16, 1998, DuPont advised Harte \r\n  that the document was unenforceable as a QDRO inasmuch as â€œ[a] QDRO cannot be \r\n  entered after the death of the participant. A participant must be a living person.Â  \r\n  There was no QDRO in effect at the participantâ€™s death that awarded any benefits \r\n  to an alternate payee.Â  Therefore, there are no benefits payable pursuant to \r\n  a QDRO.â€ In addition, the letter from DuPont advised that even if the document \r\n  had been prepared at some point prior to Walshâ€™s death, it would nonetheless \r\n  be ineffective to divest Joyce of her surviving spouse benefits inasmuch as \r\n  ERISA requires that married participants be offered qualified joint and survivor \r\n  annuities and their spouses must be offered the option to accept or waive the \r\n  benefit.Â Â  Once this election is made it is irrevocable. \r\nFrances filed the instant action against \r\n  Joyce on December 18, 2000, seeking recovery under seven theories of relief: \r\n  1) unjust enrichment; 2) â€œlaw of the caseâ€; 3) res judicata; 4) collateral estoppel; \r\n  5) breach of contract; 6) bad faith breach of contract; and 7) conversion. Joyce \r\n  answered, denying Frances was entitled to the relief sought in her complaint, \r\n  and asserted as defenses: 1) expiration of the statute of limitations; 2) failure \r\n  to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; 3) laches; and 4) res\r\njudicata. \r\n\r\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  Joyce argued, inter alia, that all of Francesâ€™s causes \r\n  of actions failed because the surviving spouse benefits vested in Joyce in 1989, \r\n  at the time of Walshâ€™s retirement, and she could not now be divested of her \r\n  right to the benefits.Â Â  Joyce further asserted the applicable statute of limitations \r\n  bars the claims.Â  In support of her cross motion, Frances asserted generally \r\n  that no genuine issues of material fact existed and specifically that Joyce \r\n  had waived her rights to the benefits in the divorce decree.Â  In addition, Frances \r\n  asserted that the court could enforce the property settlement agreement by requiring \r\n  Joyce to disgorge herself of all surviving spouse benefit payments she had received \r\n  in the past and will receive in the future by transferring the payments to Frances.\r\nBy order dated January 28, 2001, the trial \r\n  court granted Joyceâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Specifically, the court \r\n  cited Hopkins v. AT&amp;T, 105 F.3d 153, 157 (4th Cir. 1997), for the \r\n  propositions that 1) surviving spouse benefits vest in a plan participantâ€™s \r\n  current spouse on the date the participant retires, whether or not spouses are \r\n  married at the time the participant dies, and 2) surviving spouse benefits may \r\n  not be paid to a spouse who marries a participant after the participantâ€™s retirement.Â Â  \r\n  The trial court expressly determined the holding in Hopkins was determinative \r\n  of the entire case and, therefore, declined to address Joyceâ€™s other grounds \r\n  for summary judgment and further declined to reach Francesâ€™s cross motion for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Preservation\r\nWe turn our attention first to Joyceâ€™s \r\n  assertion Frances failed to properly preserve the issue of whether the trial \r\n  court properly found that all of Francesâ€™s claims were barred by ERISA provisions \r\n  inasmuch as the court expressly declined to rule on the issues and Frances did \r\n  not request, by a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion or otherwise, that the court address \r\n  such claims.Â  We hold the trial courtâ€™s express finding that it was â€œunnecessary \r\n  to reach Francesâ€™s cross motion for summary judgmentâ€ rendered Francesâ€™s remaining \r\n  issues moot and/or amounted to an effective denial of the cross motion.Â  As \r\n  such, any motion under Rule 59(e) requesting a specific ruling on the cross \r\n  motion for summary judgment would have been futile, and was in any event, not \r\n  necessary to discern the trial courtâ€™s decision as to the issues.Â  Under such \r\n  circumstances, a litigant is not required to move for relief pursuant to Rule \r\n  59(e) in order to properly preserve issues for review before this court.Â  See \r\n  Wilder Corp v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998) (noting \r\n  that proper use of 59(e) motion is to preserve issues raised to but not ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court); State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 74, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  186, 187 (1994) (excusing the failure to make a contemporaneous objection where \r\n  the judge's comments are such that any objection would be futile); Jean Hoefer \r\n  Toal et. al. Appellate Practice in South Carolina 65-68 (1999).\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary Judgment \r\nFrances argues the trial court erred in granting \r\n  Joyce summary judgment based on the courtâ€™s reasoning that ERISA provisions \r\n  governing vesting and non-alienability of surviving spouse benefit rights are \r\n  controlling as to the disposition of all of Francesâ€™s legal and equitable claims.Â Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and \r\n  inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed. Garvin v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  343 S.C. 625, 628, 541 S.E.2d 831, 833 (2001).Â  Summary judgment is inappropriate, \r\n  however, where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify \r\n  the application of the law.Â  Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 484, \r\n  523 S.E.2d 795, 799 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In determining whether any triable issue \r\n  of fact exists so as to preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences \r\n  reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n  nonmoving party.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 \r\n  S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â &nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nHere, the trial court determined that ERISA provisions, \r\n  as interpreted and applied by a single Fourth Circuit case, were determinative \r\n  of every issue involved in this case.Â  Specifically, citing and relying exclusively \r\n  upon the holding in Hopkins, the trial court concluded that Frances could \r\n  not recover on any of her claims because the surviving spouse benefits vested \r\n  in Joyce on the date Walsh retired, and, further, the benefits could not be \r\n  paid to Frances because she married Walsh after the date of his retirement. \r\n\r\nIn arriving at its ruling, the trial court failed to specifically \r\n  explore the applicability of federal case and statutory law pertaining to the \r\n  more narrowly drawn issue of whether the former spouse of an ERISA plan participant \r\n  may, incident to a separation agreement and in exchange for a comparable waiver \r\n  on the part of the other spouse, voluntarily waive his or her interest in vested \r\n  ERISA benefits.Â  In Estate of Altobelli v. Intâ€™l Bus. Machs. Corp., 77 \r\n  F.3d 78 (4th Cir. 1996), a divorced spouse, who was designated beneficiary under \r\n  her ex-husbandâ€™s ERISA plan, waived her benefits through a marital settlement \r\n  agreement that was incorporated into a divorce decree.Â  The court found that \r\n  ERISAâ€™s anti-alienation clause did not apply to a voluntary waiver by a beneficiary, \r\n  since the purpose of the anti-alienation clause is to safeguard a stream of \r\n  income for the pensioner and his beneficiaries, and to bar a waiver in favor \r\n  of pensioner himself would not advance such a purpose.Â  The court held that \r\n  it was clear that each party intended to relinquish all interests in the otherâ€™s \r\n  pension plan and therefore the former wifeâ€™s waiver was to be given full effect.Â  \r\n  Under the holding in Altobelli, we find it was error for the trial court \r\n  not to examine the language of the settlement agreement, which was incorporated \r\n  into the divorce decree, in order to determine if there was a clear intent by \r\n  Joyce to relinquish all of her interests in Walshâ€™s retirement plan and any \r\n  benefits emanating therefrom.\r\nFurther, we are compelled to agree with \r\n  Frances that although Joyce may have established an unassailable right to receive \r\n  the surviving spouse benefit payments directly from DuPont, Francesâ€™s claim \r\n  to the benefits are not, as found by the trial court, necessarily rendered untenable.Â  \r\n  By way of example, neither the anti-alienation provisions of ERISA nor the courtâ€™s \r\n  holding in Hopkins are in any way determinative of whether Joyceâ€™s retention \r\n  of those benefits would constitute unjust enrichment in light of a voluntary \r\n  agreement to waive her rights to the benefits.Â  The mere fact that Joyce, and \r\n  not Frances, is entitled to receive surviving spouse benefit payments from DuPont \r\n  does not negate Francesâ€™s right to establish, under some legal or equitable \r\n  theory of recovery, that Joyce is not entitled to retain the payments.Â  See \r\n  Succession of Netterville, 579 So.2d 1046 (La. Ct. App. 1991) (Although \r\n  the surviving spouse should be recognized as the beneficiary of the pension \r\n  plans, she was made accountable to the first wife and heirs, who under Louisiana \r\n  law had certain vested rights under the stateâ€™s community property laws.)Â  \r\nWe find the issue of whether a former spouseâ€™s \r\n  right to retain benefits under her ex-husbandâ€™s ERISA plan may be voluntarily \r\n  relinquished is a question of first impression in South Carolina.Â  Important \r\n  questions of novel impression should not be decided on summary judgment if further \r\n  inquiry into the facts is necessary to clarify the application of the law.

(concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part):Â  Although I agree with my brethren that the issues raised in this \r\n  case are preserved for appeal, I do not agree the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment. \r\nThe pertinent facts may be succinctly \r\n  stated as follows.Â  Jerome Walsh married his first wife in 1957.Â  He worked \r\n  for E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (â€œDupontâ€) for forty years, contributing \r\n  to a pension benefits plan controlled by the Employee Retirement Income Security \r\n  Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001-1461 (2003) (â€œERISAâ€).Â  He retired in 1989, while \r\n  still married to his first wife.Â  \r\nWalsh and his first wife divorced in 1990, entering \r\n  into an agreement incorporated into the final decree, which stated as follows:\r\n\r\n[T]he parties shall sign whatever documents or other paperwork \r\n  that is necessary to enforce this Agreement.Â  I find that the parties have further \r\n  agreed that each shall retain what . . . retirement plans, pension plans . . \r\n  . etc., that he or she has in his or her possession.Â  If the wife is required \r\n  to sign any papers concerning the husbandâ€™s retirement or benefit options from \r\n  Dupont of Westinghouse, then she shall sign those.Â  \r\n\r\nWalsh married his second wife in 1994 \r\n  and died in 1996.Â  No changes were made to the spousal survivor benefits in \r\n  his pension plan.Â  After the second wife was notified the first wife was the \r\n  beneficiary of the spousal retirement benefits, the second wife unsuccessfully \r\n  tried to block payment to the first wife by bringing an action in federal court.Â  \r\n  However, having no Qualified Domestic Relations Order (â€œQDROâ€) to support her \r\n  position, she was unsuccessful.Â  She then brought this action, asserting the \r\n  following legal theories for recovery: (1) unjust enrichment; (2) breach of \r\n  contract; (3) conversion; and (4) bad faith breach of contract. [2] \r\nCiting Hopkins v. AT&amp;T, 105 F.3d 153 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1997), the circuit court granted summary judgment to the first wife, \r\n  concluding under any view of the facts she was vested with the survivor spouse \r\n  benefits before the divorce, and they were not affected by the decree or any \r\n  other event occurring thereafter.Â  After careful consideration of the pertinent \r\n  facts, I agree with this disposition of the case. \r\nIn Hopkins, the husband retired after marrying \r\n  his second wife.Â  He then attempted to transfer spousal benefits to his first \r\n  wife in a QDRO to satisfy his overdue alimony obligations.Â  The court ruled \r\n  the Domestic Relations Order was not qualified, and was ineffective.Â  Writing \r\n  for the court, Judge Karen Williams noted the spousal benefits vested in the \r\n  second wife when the husband retired.Â  From that point on, those future benefits \r\n  were a separate, beneficial interest belonging to the second spouse as a beneficiary.Â  \r\n  Under ERISA, a Domestic Relations Order is only â€œQualifiedâ€ if it assigns a \r\n  â€œbenefit payable with respect to a participant.â€Â  Because the order attempted \r\n  to assign a vested beneficiary interest and not a benefit payable with respect \r\n  to a participant, the court concluded the order was not â€œQualified.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 157.\r\nHopkins stands as clear authority for the \r\n  proposition that the survivor spouse benefit vests in the spouse at the time \r\n  of the participantâ€™s retirement.Â  In this case, Walsh retired while still married \r\n  to his first wife.Â  Therefore, the survivor spouse benefit vested in the first \r\n  wife at that time, and it was her property.Â  \r\nAs the majority points out, ERISA does not preclude \r\n  the nonparticipating beneficiary from waiving the surviving spouse benefit through \r\n  specific language in a divorce settlement before the participantâ€™s retirement. \r\n  See Altobelli v. I.B.M., 77 F.3d 78, 81 (4th Cir. 1996) (Wilkinson, \r\n  J., dissenting); Fox Valley &amp; Vicinity Constr. Workers Pension Fund v. \r\n  Brown, 897 F.2d 275, 280-281 (7th Cir. 1990) (en banc), cert. denied, \r\n  498 U.S. 820 (1990).Â  For example, in Altobelli, the wife executed a \r\n  Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement Agreement, incorporated into a \r\n  divorce decree, which stated:\r\n\r\nAll of the following property is hereafter the sole and exclusive \r\n  property of the Husband, and the wife hereby waives and transfers to the \r\n  Husband any interest that she may have in the property . . .\r\n(g) Husbandâ€™s IBM pension and other deferred compensation \r\n  plans, if any.\r\n\r\n77 F.3d at 80.\r\nHowever, in this case, no such language appears \r\n  in any agreement between Walsh and his first wife.Â  The only language is that \r\n  previously noted in the divorce decree.Â  This language states only that each \r\n  party â€œretains what retirement plans, pension plans . . . etc., that \r\n  he or she has in his or her possession . . . .â€Â  Unlike Altobelli, Walsh \r\n  had retired at the point this agreement was entered.Â  Thus, the beneficial interest \r\n  had vested in the first wife, and she was in possession of it.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the language does not contain a transfer, assignment, or waiver of any interest \r\n  in the retirement plan.Â  Taking the evidence in a light most favorable to the \r\n  second wife, the decree of divorce does not contain specific language waiving \r\n  the surviving spouseâ€™s interest.\r\nThe post-death attempt to modify the circumstances \r\n  through a family court order purporting to be a nunc pro tunc QDRO has \r\n  no efficacy for two reasons.Â  First, describing the action as nunc pro tunc \r\n  does not make it so.Â  Our supreme court has noted, a nunc pro tunc order \r\n  can be used only for the purpose of placing in the record evidence of judicial \r\n  action that has actually been taken, not to correct an error, or supply an omission, \r\n  of judicial action. See Ex Parte Strom, 343 S.C. \r\n  257, 265, 539 S.E.2d 699, 703 (2000). Second, the nonparticipating beneficial \r\n  interest had vested in the first wife at retirement.Â  Therefore, the order did \r\n  not relate to a benefit payable with respect to a participant. See Hopkins, \r\n  105 F.3d at 156.Â  Thus, it was not qualified.Â  Consequently, I would affirm \r\n  the trial court.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Apparently, Walsh thought he had a common law \r\n    marriage with Frances.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The complaint delineates â€œlaw of the caseâ€; â€œres judicataâ€; â€œcollateral \r\n    estoppelâ€; and â€œbad faithâ€ as additional causes of action.Â  Assuming, without \r\n    deciding, they represent separate causes of action, these issues fail for \r\n    the same reasons discussed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3649","title":"State v.

Pope, of York; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nMOREHEAD, A.J.:Â  Christopher M. Chisolm appeals his convictions for \r\n  distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine within the proximity \r\n  of a school.Â  Chisolm argues the trial court erred: (1) in failing to suppress \r\n  drug evidence; and (2) in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the proximity \r\n  charge.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nRosie Jones purchased crack cocaine from Chisolm while acting as \r\n  a confidential informant for the York County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement \r\n  Unit (DEU), a division of the Rock Hill Police Department.\r\nOn May 9, 2000, Jones paged Chisolm from the Rock Hill Police Department \r\n  to arrange the drug buy.Â  Chisolm called back and agreed to meet Jones in a \r\n  motel parking lot.Â  An officer searched Jones prior to the drug transaction \r\n  and fitted her with a wire.Â  Jones purchased drugs from Chisolm at the motel \r\n  and returned to the police department. \r\nJones handed seven small plastic baggies containing a rock-like substance \r\n  over to Officer Dalton.Â  Dalton placed the baggies into a York County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Office evidence bag and sealed it.Â  Dalton placed his initials and date over \r\n  the seal before placing the evidence bag into a locked metal drop box in the \r\n  police station.Â  \r\nDates and signatures on the evidence bagâ€™s â€œChain of Possession of \r\n  Evidenceâ€ indicate Gary Rollins, a York County Sheriffâ€™s Office evidence technician, \r\n  retrieved the bag from the Rock Hill Police Department drop locker on May 10, \r\n  2000.Â  The next notation on the bag indicates the evidence bag was transferred \r\n  from Rene Sealy, also an evidence technician, to Cynthia Taylor on June 15, \r\n  2000.Â  There is nothing on the bag or in the record to indicate how long Rollins \r\n  possessed the bag, in what condition he received it, or where it was stored.Â  \r\n  Likewise, there is no indication of when or how Sealy came into possession of \r\n  the evidence or in what condition she received it. Neither Rollins nor Sealy \r\n  testified at trial.\r\nCynthia Taylor is an employee of the Sheriffâ€™s Office Drug Analysis \r\n  Laboratory.Â  Taylor did not begin working for the laboratory until May 29, 2000.Â  \r\n  Taylor testified that the evidence â€œstayed down in the evidence vault [in the \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Office]â€ until June 15, 2000.Â  Taylor tested the substance inside \r\n  the evidence bag and it tested positive for crack cocaine.Â  Before testing the \r\n  substance, Taylor inspected the bag for evidence of tampering, making sure it \r\n  was sealed and had no openings. \r\n At trial, Chisolm objected to the introduction of the evidence bag \r\n  containing the crack cocaine. Â Chisolm argued the chain of custody had \r\n  not been established.Â  The trial court overruled the objection and admitted \r\n  the drugs into evidence.Â Â  \r\nTo prove the proximity charge Officer Dalton testified the sale of \r\n  crack cocaine took place within one-half mile of the York County Adult Education \r\n  Center.Â  Dalton identified the Center as a public school. Â The State \r\n  introduced a map depicting the Center within one-half mile of the motel where \r\n  Chisolm sold the crack cocaine. Â Dalton generated the map by using a \r\n  mapping program in the City Hallâ€™s Planning Division office that highlights \r\n  any schools or parks within the Rock Hill city limits. \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Chisolm moved for a directed verdict \r\n  on the proximity charge, arguing the State failed to present evidence of a transaction \r\n  that occurred within one-half mile of a school.Â  The trial court denied the \r\n  motion, finding there was evidence in the record by which the jury could conclude \r\n  the transaction occurred within one-half mile of a school. \r\nThe jury found Chisolm guilty on both charges.Â  The trial court sentenced \r\n  Chisolm to twelve-year concurrent sentences on each count.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the trial court err in admitting the crack cocaine into evidence?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the trial court err in denying Chisolmâ€™s motion for a directed verdict concerning \r\n  whether the distribution of crack cocaine occurred within one-half mile of a \r\n  school?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Chain of Custody\r\nChisolm argues the trial judge erred in admitting the crack cocaine \r\n  into evidence because the State failed to prove a sufficient chain of custody.Â  \r\n  Chisolm contends the chain of custody is incomplete and has not been established \r\n  pursuant to Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.\r\nA complete chain of evidence, tracing possession \r\n  from the evidenceâ€™s initial control to its final analysis, must be established \r\n  as far as practicable.Â  State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 544 S.E.2d 835 \r\n  (2001).Â  A missing link in a chain of custody creates an issue of admissibility.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  If a substance has passed through multiple custodians, it must not \r\n  be left to conjecture concerning who had the evidence and what was done with \r\n  it between the taking and the analysis.Â  State v. Joseph, 328 S.C. 352, \r\n  491 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe State presented the testimony of the first (Dalton) and last (Taylor) links \r\n  in the chain of custody.Â  However, the State did not provide testimony from \r\n  either of the intervening links (Rollins and Sealy) in the chain.Â  Rollins received \r\n  the evidence on May 10, 2000, from the Rock Hill drop locker but the record \r\n  does not indicate when or how Sealy came into possession of the evidence.Â  Taylorâ€™s \r\n  testimony, while it explained her receipt of the evidence from Sealy, did not \r\n  provide for the whereabouts of the evidence for the interval Rollins or Sealy \r\n  possessed it.Â  Moreover, Taylor had not started her employment with the laboratory \r\n  at the time Rollins received the evidence and could not explain what Rollins \r\n  had done with the evidence.Â Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nAs an alternative to presenting the testimony of the intervening custodians, \r\n  the State could have utilized Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP, to establish the chain of \r\n  custody.Â  See Joseph, 328 S.C. at 364, 491 S.E.2d at 281 (stating \r\n  Rule 6 does not supplant the general law governing chain of custody requirements \r\n  but provides an alternate means of establishing a chain of custody).Â  This rule \r\n  allows for the admission of sworn statements in lieu of the appearance of chain \r\n  of custody witnesses and provides that:\r\n\r\na certified or sworn statement signed by each successive \r\n  person having custody of the evidence that he or she delivered it to the person \r\n  stated is evidence that the person had custody and made delivery as stated without \r\n  the necessity of the person who signed the statement being present in court \r\n  provided: (1) the statement contains a sufficient description of the substance \r\n  or its container to distinguish it; and (2) the statement says the substance \r\n  was delivered in substantially the same condition as when received.\r\n\r\nRule 6(b), SCRCrimP.\r\nThere is no dispute that the State did not submit the testimony of each individual \r\n  who handled the evidence nor did the State comply with Rule 6(b).Â  The trial \r\n  court, however, allowed the introduction of the evidence despite the missing \r\n  links in the chain because the State demonstrated that the evidence had not \r\n  been tampered with by the time Taylor received it for analysis.Â  This was error.Â  \r\n  The only insight into the handling of the evidence by Rollins and Sealy is their \r\n  possession of the bag at some point in time as witnessed by their signatures. \r\n  Â The evidenceâ€™s whereabouts is unaccounted for between May 10 and June 15.Â  \r\n  While the chain of custody â€œneed not negate all possibility of tampering,â€ the \r\n  State is required to show that the chain is complete.Â  Carter, 344 S.C. \r\n  at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837.Â  Moreover, it would not have been impracticable for \r\n  the State to have called each custodian to testify or for the State to have \r\n  submitted sworn statements from the custodians under the procedures of Rule \r\n  6(b), SCRCrimP.Â  See State v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  306 (1992) (stating the party offering evidence is required to establish, at \r\n  least as far as practicable, a complete chain of evidence).Â  Custodial signatures \r\n  on an evidence bag fail to establish an adequate chain of custody where the \r\n  custodians do not provide testimony under oath or produce sworn statements pursuant \r\n  to Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.Â  Thus, the trial court erred in admitting the crack \r\n  cocaine into evidence.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict\r\nChisolm argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a \r\n  directed verdict based on the lack of competent evidence showing he distributed \r\n  crack cocaine within one-half mile of a school. [1]&nbsp; \r\nIn reviewing an appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this \r\n  Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State.Â  State \r\n  v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999).Â  â€œIf there is any direct \r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove \r\n  the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the case was properly \r\n  submitted to the jury.â€Â  State v. McGowan, 347 S.C. 618, 622, 557 S.E.2d \r\n  657, 659 (2001).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State \r\n  fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McHoney, \r\n  344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â Â Â Â  \r\nInitially, the State argues Chisolm failed to preserve this issue for appeal.Â  \r\n  The State contends Chisolm moved for a directed verdict on different grounds \r\n  from the one now raised on appeal.Â  See State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. \r\n  1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989) (stating a party cannot argue one ground at trial and \r\n  a different ground on appeal).Â  The record clearly shows Chisolm based his motion \r\n  for directed verdict on the lack of any competent evidence showing the drug \r\n  deal occurred within one-half mile of a school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nTo prove Chisolm sold drugs within one-half mile of a school under section \r\n  44-53-445, the State must show the distribution occurred â€œwithin a one-half \r\n  mile radius of the grounds of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary \r\n  school; a public playground or park; a public vocational or trade school or \r\n  technical educational center; or a public or private college or university.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (2002); see Brown v. State, 343 S.C. \r\n  342, 348, 540 S.E.2d 846, 849 (2001) (stating â€œthe distribution [must occur] \r\n  within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of an elementary, middle, secondary \r\n  or vocational school; public playground or park; or college or universityâ€).Â  \r\n\r\nTo carry its burden of proof, the State introduced a map depicting an â€œAdult \r\n  Education Centerâ€ within a one-half mile radius of the location where the sale \r\n  of drugs took place.Â  Further, Officer Dalton stated that the York County Adult \r\n  Education Center, a public school, was within one-half mile of the motel. \r\nChisolm argues that under Brown the State must present evidence that \r\n  the Center fits within one of the categories covered by section 44-53-445.Â  \r\n  In Brown, our Supreme Court found the trial court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction on charges under section 44-53-445 where the indictment alleged \r\n  distribution of crack cocaine within one-half mile of a day care center.Â  Brown, \r\n  343 S.C. at 346, 540 S.E.2d at 848.Â  The Court held that a day care center was \r\n  not intended to be included as an elementary school under the statute.Â  Id. \r\n  at 349, 540 S.E.2d at 850.\r\nThis Court is not faced in the present case with an issue of whether an adult \r\n  education center is intended to fall under the statuteâ€™s parameters.Â Â Â  Here, \r\n  the State presented sufficient evidence for the jury to determine whether the \r\n  sale of drugs occurred within one-half mile of one of the types of schools listed \r\n  in section 44-53-445.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe trial court did not err in denying Chisolmâ€™s motion for directed verdict \r\n  on the charge of distribution of crack cocaine within one-half mile of a school.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Chisolmâ€™s directed verdict \r\n  motion on the proximity of a school charge.Â  We reverse the trial courtâ€™s admission \r\n  of the drug evidence and remand for a new trial.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [1] Â  Chisolm also argues \r\n    the trial judge should have granted his motion for a new trial.Â  However, \r\n    Chisolm did not move for a new trial but rather improperly moved for JNOV.Â  \r\n    JNOV is a civil trial motion.Â  In a criminal trial, a motion for a new trial \r\n    is the only available post-trial motion for addressing the sufficiency of \r\n    the evidence.Â  See State v.

[1] Â  Cole also challenges \r\n  various rulings made during the trial of the case.Â  We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nGeorge Cole \r\n  and three other individuals visited a recreational beach area located at Lake \r\n  Murray on land owned by SCE&amp;G.Â  At the entrance to the area, automobiles \r\n  wishing to park are required to pay three dollars.Â  The driver of the car in \r\n  which George was a passenger paid the fee. \r\nThe recreational site is fenced-in and \r\n  is patrolled by a security guard.Â  There are no lifeguards on duty at the lakefront \r\n  nor is safety equipment present at the site.Â  The swimming area is roped off \r\n  with buoy lines.Â  Warning signs on the property indicate there are no lifeguards \r\n  on duty and that individuals swim at their own risk.Â  After paying for parking, \r\n  a similar written notice is handed to the patrons. \r\nGeorge entered the water, swam to the \r\n  buoy line, and drowned while attempting to return to shore.Â  Other swimmers \r\n  and paramedics, who were called to the scene, attempted to revive him but were \r\n  unsuccessful. \r\nThe complaint alleged causes of action for negligence, \r\n  nuisance, and unreasonably dangerous activity.Â  SCE&amp;G answered and asserted \r\n  as defenses, among other things, the RUS, assumption of risk, accident, and \r\n  comparative negligence.Â  Following amendments to the pleadings, SCE&amp;G moved \r\n  for summary judgment. \r\nThe trial court granted SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion for \r\n  summary judgment on Coleâ€™s causes of action for nuisance and unreasonably dangerous \r\n  activity and denied summary judgment on the negligence cause of action.Â  In \r\n  a subsequent order, the court clarified its initial ruling.Â  The court found \r\n  the parking fee was not a â€œchargeâ€ as contemplated under the RUS.Â  Thus, the \r\n  court granted partial summary judgment for SCE&amp;G on the negligence cause \r\n  of action.Â  This ruling required Cole to demonstrate gross negligence in order \r\n  to find SCE&amp;G liable.Â  \r\nAt trial, Coleâ€™s expert witness \r\n  testified George would not have died had a lifeguard been present at the site.Â  \r\n  The expert also testified the buoy line was located too far from shore and at \r\n  an improper depth.Â  Cole elicited testimony concerning whether SCE&amp;G was \r\n  subject to Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) Regulation \r\n  61-50, requiring a lifeguard to be present at a public swimming area.Â  Cole \r\n  contended the regulation was applicable to the case and a violation of the regulation \r\n  could be used as evidence of gross negligence. \r\nThe jury found in favor of SCE&amp;G.Â  \r\n  Cole moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, in the alternative, \r\n  for a new trial.Â  The trial court denied the motions and this appeal follows. \r\n  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Recreational Use Statute\r\nCole first contends the trial court \r\n  erred in granting partial summary judgment to SCE&amp;G based on the RUS.Â  The \r\n  trial court ruled that SCE&amp;G could still be found liable for gross negligence \r\n  under section 27-3-60(a).Â  However, given the court found as a matter of law \r\n  that the parking fee was not a â€œcharge,â€ it ruled Cole was barred from pursuing \r\n  judgment against SCE&amp;G for simple negligence under section 27-3-60(b).Â  \r\n  Cole argues the three dollar parking fee was a â€œchargeâ€ as contemplated in section \r\n  27-3-60(b), and, therefore, SCE&amp;G was not entitled to protection from liability \r\n  for negligence under the RUS.Â  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Roof v. Swanson, \r\n  344 S.C. 315, 543 S.E.2d 278 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIn ruling on a motion for summary \r\n  judgment, the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Baird v. \r\n  Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999).Â  â€œSummary \r\n  judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case \r\n  is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross \r\n  &amp; Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 362, 563 S.E.2d \r\n  331, 333 (2002).\r\nThe following facts are undisputed.Â  \r\n  Every vehicle entering SCE&amp;Gâ€™s recreation site is required to pay a per-vehicle \r\n  parking fee. [2] Â  The fee is not assessed on each person in an automobile.Â  \r\n  Rather, the fee covers every person riding in the vehicle.Â  The driver of George \r\n  Coleâ€™s party paid the parking fee upon entering the site.Â  Access to the site \r\n  is free to individuals who walk, swim, or ride a bike to the site.Â  Drive-through \r\n  traffic is prohibited and vehicles leaving the site are assessed an additional, \r\n  identical fee upon re-entry. Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe RUS â€œencourage[s] owners of land to make land \r\n  and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting \r\n  their liability toward persons entering thereon for such purposes.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-3-10 (1991).Â  â€œLandowners owe â€˜no duty of care to keep the premises \r\n  safeâ€™ for recreational users and need not â€˜give any warning of a dangerous condition, \r\n  use, structure or activityâ€™ on the property.â€Â  Brooks v. Northwood Little \r\n  League, Inc., 327 S.C. 400, 403, 489 S.E.2d 647, 648 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-3-30 (1991)).Â  \r\nFurthermore, an owner who permits a person to use \r\n  property for recreational purposes without charge does not: â€œ(a) Extend any \r\n  assurance that the premises are safe for any purpose[;] [or] (b) Confer upon \r\n  such person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to whom a duty of care \r\n  is owed.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-3-40 (1991).Â  A â€œchargeâ€ is defined as â€œthe admission \r\n  price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon \r\n  the land.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-3-20(d) (1991).Â  The only caveats, found in \r\n  section 27-3-60, provide: \r\n\r\nNothing in this chapter limits \r\n  in any way any liability which otherwise exists:\r\n(a) For grossly negligent, willful or malicious failure to \r\n  guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.\r\n(b) For injury suffered in any case where the owner of land \r\n  charges persons who enter or go on the land for the recreational use \r\n  thereof, except that in the case of land leased to the State or a subdivision \r\n  thereof, any consideration received by the owner for such lease shall not be \r\n  deemed a charge within the meaning of this section. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-3-60 (1991) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina has not had \r\n  the opportunity to determine whether a parking fee is a charge under section \r\n  27-3-60(b).Â  The Supreme Court of Georgia considered this issue in relation \r\n  to Georgiaâ€™s Recreational Property Act in Stone Mountain Memâ€™l Assâ€™n v. Herrington, \r\n  171 S.E.2d 521 (Ga. 1969). Â Â The Georgia court found that a two dollar parking \r\n  fee at Stone Mountain Park was not a â€œchargeâ€ \r\n  [3]  or admission fee removing the Memorial Association from the protection \r\n  of Georgiaâ€™s Recreational Property Act.Â  Id. at 522-23.Â  In affirming \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the defendant, the court found \r\n  persuasive the following uncontroverted facts:Â  (1) â€œ[p]ersons on foot are not \r\n  charged any fee, nor is a fee charged for a number of people in any one vehicleâ€; \r\n  and (2) â€œ[t]he fee is strictly a parking fee for the automobile to enter.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 523.Â  \r\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals has also examined \r\n  this issue.Â  In Majeske v. Jekyll Island State Park Auth., 433 S.E.2d \r\n  304 (Ga. Ct. App. 1993), the court held that a per-vehicle fee, not based on \r\n  the number of occupants, and not charged to individuals entering by means other \r\n  than motorized vehicle, was not a â€œchargeâ€ sufficient to remove the Authority \r\n  from the protection of Georgiaâ€™s Recreational Property Act.Â  The court also \r\n  determined that a re-entry fee did not transform what was strictly a parking \r\n  fee into a â€œchargeâ€ for admission.Â  Id. at 305-06; cf. Hogue \r\n  v. Stone Mountain Memâ€™l Assâ€™n, 358 S.E.2d 852 (Ga. Ct. App. 1987) (holding \r\n  an initial four dollar fee allowing re-entry during the course of the patronâ€™s \r\n  stay permitted the use of a vehicle in the park and did not constitute a charge \r\n  for the recreational use of the park).\r\nSimilarly, in Garreans v. City of Omaha, \r\n  345 N.W.2d 309 (Neb. 1984), a park charged patrons fees for the right to park \r\n  campers and pitch tents, and for the use of camper dumping facilities.Â  However, \r\n  those generally entering the park paid nothing.Â  The Nebraska statute defined \r\n  â€œchargeâ€ as â€œthe amount of money asked in return for an invitation to enter \r\n  or go upon the land.â€Â  Id. at 313.Â  The court, in holding the fee paid \r\n  by the plaintiffâ€™s grandmother was not a charge for entry upon the land, determined \r\n  â€œthat in order to constitute a charge, any moneys paid must be paid for the \r\n  right to enter the facility.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe find these decisions to be \r\n  highly persuasive and agree that a parking fee assessed only to those entering \r\n  by motor vehicle, and on a per-vehicle basis, does not constitute a â€œchargeâ€ \r\n  under section 27-3-60(b).Â  The undisputed evidence demonstrates only that the \r\n  fee is purely for the privilege of using a motorized vehicle at the site and \r\n  is not related to the admission of individuals to the recreation site and is \r\n  not imposed in return for recreational use of the site.Â  Herrington, \r\n  171 S.E.2d at 522-23; Hogue, 358 S.E.2d at 854; see also Jones \r\n  v. United States, 693 F.2d 1299 (9th Cir. 1982) (applying Washington law \r\n  and holding a landowner may charge a fee for something other than use of the \r\n  land, and still enjoy recreational use immunity).Â  Accordingly, the circuit \r\n  court properly determined as a matter of law that the RUS operated to prevent \r\n  Cole from recovering from SCE&amp;G based on allegations of simple negligence.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Applicability of DHEC Regulation\r\nCole next contends that 24A S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Regs. 61-50 (1992), [4]  \r\n  was applicable to the facts of the case.Â  Regulation 61-50 generally requires \r\n  the use of lifeguards and safety equipment at natural public swimming areas.Â  \r\n  Cole argues the trial courtâ€™s jury instruction was erroneous because it did \r\n  not mandate application of the regulation, but instead allowed the jury to determine \r\n  whether the regulation applied to the recreation facility.Â  \r\nThe trial court must charge the current and correct \r\n  law.Â  McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995).Â  â€œâ€˜In \r\n  reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as \r\n  a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  If, as a whole, \r\n  the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be \r\n  misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€™â€Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. \r\n  Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999) (quoting \r\n  Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 547, 462 S.E.2d 321, 330 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995)); see also Waldrup v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 274 S.C. \r\n  344, 346, 263 S.E.2d 652, 654 (1980) (finding appellate court must view the \r\n  jury charge as a whole before assigning prejudicial error to a discrete portion \r\n  of the charge).\r\nDuring arguments on the applicability of Regulation \r\n  61-50 to the facts of this case, SCE&amp;G tried to show that an administrative \r\n  order exempting it from enforcement of the regulationâ€™s prior version was also \r\n  applicable to the regulation in effect at the time of the drowning because DHEC \r\n  had never attempted to enforce its provisions.Â  The trial court indicated during \r\n  the charge conference that it would charge the jury that they could consider \r\n  the exemption order and DHECâ€™s lack of enforcement in determining whether the \r\n  regulation was applicable to SCE&amp;Gâ€™s recreation site.Â  Cole objected, stating \r\n  the court should decide as a matter of law whether the regulation applied.Â  \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its previous indication, the trial \r\n  court did not address the administrative order during its charge on the regulation.Â  \r\n  In charging the jury, the trial court began:Â  \r\n\r\nNow in addition to the statutory elements of this negligence \r\n  case which I have just read to you, Iâ€™m also going to instruct you as to other \r\n  regulations which may or may not apply in this particular case.Â  You and you \r\n  alone are the judge of the facts and you will determine whether or not these \r\n  regulations have been violated, and if you determine from the facts that they \r\n  have been violated, then you will apply the law as I give it to you. \r\n\r\nWhile the trial court begins by saying \r\n  the regulations may or may not apply, it clearly instructs the jury that its \r\n  function is to determine if the regulations as explained were violated by SCE&amp;G, \r\n  and if violated then the jury must apply the law as pronounced.Â  The court then \r\n  instructs the jury regarding the requirements of Regulation 61-50, including \r\n  lifeguard requirements, proper warning signage, swimming area barriers, and \r\n  safety equipment.Â  The trial court never explained how the jury would determine \r\n  whether the regulation applied.\r\nThe trial court concluded with the following instructions:\r\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, violation of any of the provisions \r\n  of these regulations is negligence that is a matter of law.Â  \r\nThis means that proof of such violation is in and of itself \r\n  proof of negligence.Â  But before you can hold the defendant liable, you must \r\n  determine not only that the defendant was negligent, but that it was grossly \r\n  negligent as provided in the statute.Â  While evidence of a statute, evidence \r\n  of a violation of a statute or regulation constitutes negligence, such violation \r\n  by itself does not constitute gross negligence or recklessness, wilfulness, \r\n  or wantonness.\r\nHowever, it may constitute evidence of these things, and \r\n  you may consider such violation along with other facts and circumstances surrounding \r\n  the event to determine whether or not the defendant was grossly negligent, recklessness \r\n  [sic], wilful or wanton. \r\n\r\nGiven Regulation 61-50 defines \r\n  safety and health considerations for natural public swimming areas the trial \r\n  court should have decided as a matter of law whether Regulation 61-50 applied \r\n  to the facts of this case.Â  See Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387-8, 520 S.E.2d 142, \r\n  149 (1999) (stating an affirmative legal duty may be created by statute and \r\n  the court must determine as a matter of law whether the law recognizes a particular \r\n  duty); Miller v. City of Camden, 317 S.C. 28, 31, 451 S.C. 401, 403 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994), affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 310, 494 S.E.2d 813 (1997) (stating \r\n  the existence and scope of a duty is a question of law; thereafter, the jury \r\n  determines whether a breach of the duty has occurred); see also Stewart \r\n  v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 350 S.C. 589, 593, 567 S.E.2d 510, 512 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002) (stating the applicable standard of care under the Tort Claims Act was \r\n  a question of law where the pleadings placed the case squarely within the statutory \r\n  language).Â  However, any error is harmless given the tenor of the overall charge.Â  \r\n  The entire charge as given leaves it up to the jury to decide whether the regulation \r\n  was violated, not whether it actually applied to SCE&amp;G.Â  The trial court \r\n  instructed the jury on the ramifications of its decision if it found a violation \r\n  to have occurred, requiring the jury to consider the violation as evidence of \r\n  negligence in determining whether SCE&amp;G was grossly negligent.Â  As such, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s charge on the regulation did not prejudice Cole. Â See \r\n  Waldrup, 274 S.C. at 346, 263 S.E.2d at 654 (finding a charge must be \r\n  construed and considered as a whole before an assignment of prejudicial error \r\n  will lie for the discrete portion complained of).Â  The trial court did not provide \r\n  the jury any criteria to establish whether the regulation applied.Â  Rather, \r\n  the jury was left to determine only whether a violation of the regulation had \r\n  occurred.\r\nIII.Â  Assumption of Risk Instruction\r\nCole argues the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to properly instruct the jury regarding the burden of proof on SCE&amp;Gâ€™s \r\n  assumption of risk defense.Â  \r\nDuring the charge conference the trial \r\n  court indicated it did not believe assumption of risk was an affirmative defense \r\n  and therefore the burden would not shift to SCE&amp;G to prove all the elements \r\n  of this defense. SCE&amp;Gâ€™s counsel questioned this statement of the law by \r\n  stating:Â  â€œit is my understanding assumption of the risk is an affirmative defense.â€Â  \r\n  Coleâ€™s counsel then inquired whether the trial court planned to charge that \r\n  Cole had the burden of showing that assumption of risk did not apply and also \r\n  how the court was going to assign the burden concerning the assumption of risk \r\n  defense.Â  The court stated it would not place the burden on Cole and decided \r\n  not â€œto tell [the jury] anything about a burden.â€ \r\nAt the outset of the portion of the jury instruction \r\n  discussing SCE&amp;Gâ€™s defenses the trial court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  However, if you are satisfied that the Plaintiff has proven \r\n  that the Defendant was grossly negligent as described in the Recreational Use \r\n  Statute and that the Plaintiff was injured or damaged as a proximate result \r\n  of that negligence, then you must consider the defenses that have been set forth \r\n  by the Defendant. \r\n\r\nThe trial court then detailed several of the defenses asserted \r\n  by SCE&amp;G, including a general denial.Â  The court stated that a general denial \r\n  places the burden â€œupon the Plaintiff to prove each and every element of their \r\n  cause of action.â€Â  Turning to assumption of risk, the trial court listed the \r\n  elements of the defense, but never specifically placed the burden of proving \r\n  this defense upon SCE&amp;G.Â  Instead, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\nA Plaintiff who voluntarily assumes the risk of injury arising \r\n  from the negligent conduct of the Defendant cannot recover for the injury. . \r\n  . .Â  If you find from the evidence that the Defendant was grossly negligent \r\n  as alleged in the complaint but that the Plaintiff couldâ€™ve reasonably foreseen, \r\n  expected or anticipated such negligence, then the Plaintiff will be held to \r\n  have assumed the risk and your verdict must be for the Defendant. \r\n\r\nAfter the jury charge, Cole objected to the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  failure to charge the burden of proof with regard to the assumption of risk \r\n  defense. \r\nThe trial court must charge the current \r\n  and correct law.Â  McCourt, 318 S.C. at 306, 457 S.E.2d at 606.Â  â€œA jury \r\n  charge is correct if â€˜[w]hen the charge is read as a whole, it contains the \r\n  correct definition and adequately covers the law.â€™â€Â  Keaton, 334 S.C. \r\n  at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574 (quoting State v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, \r\n  487 n.1, 445 S.E.2d 637, 638 n.1 (1994)).\r\nIt is well established that a party \r\n  pleading an affirmative defense has the burden of proving it.Â  Pike v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000); Hoffman \r\n  v. County of Greenville, 242 S.C. 34, 129 S.E.2d 757 (1963).Â  â€œWhen a defendant \r\n  interposes an affirmative defense, he becomes as to that matter the actor in \r\n  the suit, and the burden of proof rests upon him to establish his affirmative \r\n  defense by the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Lorick &amp; Lowrance, Inc. \r\n  v. Julius H. Walker &amp; Co., 153 S.C. 309, 318, 150 S.E. 789, 792 (1929).\r\nâ€œAssumption of risk is an affirmative defense.â€Â  \r\n  Howard v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways, 343 S.C. 149, 155, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  291, 294 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Wallace v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., \r\n  300 S.C. 518, 524, 389 S.E.2d 155, 158 (Ct. App. 1989) (stating â€œthe affirmative \r\n  defense of assumption of risk ordinarily presents a question of fact for the \r\n  juryâ€). [5] Â  \r\nThe trial court committed reversible error by \r\n  not placing the burden of proving the affirmative defense of assumption of risk \r\n  with SCE&amp;G in its jury charge.Â  See Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. \r\n  428, 532 S.E.2d 612 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding the trial court erred in not charging \r\n  the jury that a defendant had the burden of proving the affirmative defense \r\n  of comparative negligence).Â  When viewed as a whole the courtâ€™s instruction \r\n  did not convey this burden to the jury.Â  Instructing the jury to â€œconsiderâ€ \r\n  defenses set forth by a defendant is a far cry from stating that a defendant \r\n  has the burden of proving the defense.Â  Moreover, in light of the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  explanation of a general denial, the potential prejudice from failing to explain \r\n  SCE&amp;Gâ€™s burden of proof is multiplied.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIV.Â  Limitation on Argument about â€œMaking Moneyâ€\r\nAfter Cole presented her first \r\n  witness, SCE&amp;G moved to strike any testimony relating to money paid at the \r\n  site.Â  The trial court did not grant this motion but did state that in light \r\n  of the courtâ€™s earlier ruling regarding the applicability of the RUS it would \r\n  be inappropriate for Cole to argue SCE&amp;G was making money at the site through \r\n  the receipt of parking fees.Â  Cole contends she is entitled to a new trial because \r\n  the trial court erred in refusing to allow her to argue SCE&amp;G was â€œmaking \r\n  moneyâ€ at the site and did not operate the site â€œout of the goodness of their \r\n  hearts.â€ \r\nWe decline to consider this argument because Coleâ€™s \r\n  argument is not supported with citations of authority, and it is so conclusory \r\n  as to be an abandonment of this issue on appeal.Â  First Sav. Bank v. McLean, \r\n  314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994); see Glasscock, Inc. \r\n  v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 557 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001) (stating short, conclusory arguments unsupported by authority are \r\n  deemed abandoned).Â  In any event, the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  by limiting questioning and argument on this point.Â  Whether SCE&amp;G made \r\n  money from the parking fee was not relevant to any issue in the case.Â  Moreover, \r\n  Cole was able to elicit at least some testimony indicating SCE&amp;G required \r\n  a fee for parking at the site.Â  Thus, whether SCE&amp;G made money on the parking \r\n  fees did not go completely unaddressed.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, \r\n  the jury verdict in favor of SCE&amp;G is reversed and we remand for a new trial.Â  \r\n  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of partial summary judgment to SCE&amp;G based \r\n  on the RUS. \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  S.C.

Schmauch (Appellant) to collect amounts owed on two loans \r\n  allegedly guaranteed by Appellant.Â  Appellant filed an answer, counterclaim, \r\n  and third-party complaint.Â  Regions Bank and Richard Furman (collectively referred \r\n  to as Respondents) both moved for summary judgment.Â  Appellant also moved for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  The trial judge granted Respondentsâ€™ motions and denied Appellantâ€™s \r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  Appellantâ€™s motion to alter or amend was also \r\n  denied.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellantâ€™s son, Donald Joe Schmauch (Joe Schmauch), \r\n  was owner of MCA Skywatch Traffic Network, Inc. (MCA) and Martin, Coleman &amp; \r\n  Associates, Inc. (Martin Coleman).Â  Appellant provided financial support for \r\n  Joe Schmauchâ€™s businesses on many occasions, including loaning him money and \r\n  co-signing on loans.Â  The businesses were established to purchase helicopters \r\n  and use them to provide air surveillance for local broadcast stations and power \r\n  companies.\r\nOn February 15, 1996, Joe Schmauch obtained \r\n  a loan (first loan) from Greenville National Bank [1]  for $100,000.00 on behalf of Martin Coleman.Â  \r\n  Appellant accompanied Joe Schmauch to obtain the loan.Â  A certificate of deposit \r\n  (CD) owned by Appellant was listed as collateral for the loan.Â  Richard Furman \r\n  conducted the loan closing and executed the necessary paperwork.Â  The note provided \r\n  for payments to begin March 15, 1996 and the balance due on February 15, 1999.Â  \r\n  Appellant has admitted making payments on the loan when Joe Schmauch or Martin \r\n  Coleman was unable to make the payments.\r\nMartin Coleman received a second loan \r\n  (second loan) for $40,000.00 from Regions Bank on May 30, 1996.Â  Appellant signed \r\n  a Guaranty Agreement on May 30, 1996.Â  However, neither the borrowerâ€™s name \r\n  nor the liability section of the Guaranty was completed.\r\nOn July 17, 1996, Martin Coleman renewed \r\n  the second loan and borrowed additional funds to bring the total to $60,000.00.Â  \r\n  A second Guaranty Agreement purports to bear Appellantâ€™s signature.Â  The Guaranty \r\n  provides for unlimited liability with regards to the loans given to Martin Coleman.Â  \r\n  While the July 17, 1996 Guaranty is completely filled out, it does not contain \r\n  a reference to a specific loan number.Â  It is simply matched to the loan by \r\n  the date on the Guaranty.\r\nThe second loan was again renewed on September \r\n  12, 1996, and additional funds were borrowed bringing the total to $65,190.80.Â  \r\n  An additional Guaranty is in the possession of Regions Bank.Â  While the Guaranty \r\n  purports to bear Appellantâ€™s signature, she denied it is her signature.Â  The \r\n  second loan was renewed several more times, including December 4, 1996.Â  The \r\n  December Note indicates Appellant is the co-borrower.Â  However, Furman admitted \r\n  she was listed as the co-borrower in error.Â  Appellant also made payments on \r\n  the second loan.\r\nOn February 15, 1999, the balance remaining on \r\n  the first loan became due.Â  Martin Coleman did not make payment.Â  Regions Banks \r\n  liquidated the CD and applied the proceeds to the amount due on the loan.Â  The \r\n  proceeds left a balance due of $1,726.05.Â  The second loan came due on June \r\n  7, 1999.Â  The balance due on the second loan was $51,154.79.Â  Payment by Appellant \r\n  was refused, and Regions Bank brought the instant action.\r\nRegions Bank brought this collection action \r\n  against Appellant on September 3, 1999, seeking to recover the balances owed \r\n  on the two loans to Martin Coleman.Â  Appellant filed an amended answer in which \r\n  she made a general denial and proffered numerous allegations including fraud, \r\n  discharge, forgery, equitable estoppel, coercion, and failure to provide notice \r\n  of default.Â  She also counterclaimed alleging, among others, negligence, breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty, conversion, and fraud.Â  Moreover, she asserted a third-party \r\n  claim against Furman for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and \r\n  fraud, among other claims. [2] \r\nRespondents moved for summary judgment \r\n  on July 10, 2001.Â  Appellant also moved for summary judgment.Â  At the hearing \r\n  on the motions, Appellant withdrew several of her defenses, counterclaims, and \r\n  third-party claims.Â  The trial judge granted Respondentsâ€™ motions for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  The court found the loan documents were clear and there was a contract \r\n  between Appellant and Regions Bank for Appellant to guarantee the loans.Â  The \r\n  court concluded Appellant breached the Guaranty contract and awarded Regions \r\n  Bank damages of $62,924.52 plus interest until the judgment is paid.Â  The judge \r\n  decided there was no evidence of forgery, fraud, or equitable estoppel.\r\nThe court determined Respondents did not \r\n  owe Appellant any duty of care, and therefore, there were no grounds upon which \r\n  to find them negligent.Â  The court determined that the relationship between \r\n  Regions Bank and Appellant was that of creditor-debtor and not a fiduciary relationship.Â  \r\n  Summary judgment was awarded to Respondents on Appellantâ€™s claim of conversion \r\n  because the court held she pledged the CD as collateral and had no right to \r\n  possession at the time the CD was liquidated.Â  Finally, the court ruled Appellant \r\n  did not establish fraud on the part of Respondents.Â  Appellantâ€™s motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment was denied.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI. Did the trial court err when it found Appellant pledged \r\n  her CD as collateral and properly completed a Guaranty Agreement in granting \r\n  summary judgment in favor of Regions Bank on its collection action?\r\nII. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment in \r\n  favor of Respondents on Appellantâ€™s claim of fraud?\r\nIII. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment \r\n  in favor of Respondents on Appellantâ€™s claim of equitable estoppel?\r\nIV. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment in \r\n  favor of Respondents on Appellantâ€™s claim of negligence?\r\nV. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment in \r\n  favor of Respondents on Appellantâ€™s claim of breach of fiduciary duty?\r\nVI. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment in \r\n  favor of Respondents on Appellantâ€™s claim of conversion?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n  County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997); Wells v. City \r\n  of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In \r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same \r\n  standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary judgment is proper when â€œthere \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v. Am. Tel. \r\n  &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  Under \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden \r\n  of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Trivelas \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 130, 558 S.E.2d 271, 273 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial \r\n  burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, \r\n  the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in \r\n  the pleadings.Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific \r\n  facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; SSI \r\n  Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 497, 392 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1990); \r\n  Peterson v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  \r\n  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will \r\n  review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the \r\n  evidence in a light most favorable to the non&#8209;moving party below.â€Â  Osborne \r\n  v.

Farmers Tel. Co-op, \r\n  Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 335, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999); Roberts v. Gaskins, \r\n  327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).

App. 1993).Â  \r\n  The issue in this case involves Appellantâ€™s acceptance of the contract.\r\nAppellant has acknowledged that two of \r\n  the guaranty agreements contain her signature: the May 30 and July 17 agreements.Â  \r\n  The May 30 Guaranty Agreement is incomplete and therefore cannot constitute \r\n  acceptance.Â  However, the July 17 Guaranty Agreement is complete and purports \r\n  to bind Appellant to unlimited liability for Martin Colemanâ€™s present and future \r\n  indebtedness:\r\nThe liability of the undersigned under this Guaranty Agreement:\r\n\r\nX shall be UNLIMITED as to amount and the undersigned shall \r\n  be liable for all debts of the borrower.\r\n\r\nThe Guaranty Agreement specifies what debt is being guaranteed:\r\n\r\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of such credit extended and/or \r\n  to be extended in its discretion by the Bank to the Borrower (whether to the \r\n  same, greater, or lesser extent than the limit of this guaranty), the undersigned \r\n  . . . who executes this guaranty agreement to induce the Bank to extend credit \r\n  to the Borrower, hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Bank . . . the punctual \r\n  payment when due, with such interest as may accrue thereon either before or \r\n  after any maturity(ies) thereof, of ALL DEBTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER \r\n  OR OF THE BORROWER[S] AND ANY OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES, NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER \r\n  ARISING, whether created directly or acquired by endorsement, assignment or \r\n  otherwise, whether absolute or contingent, secured or unsecured, due or not \r\n  due, including but not being limited to notes, checks, drafts, bills of exchange, \r\n  credits and advances, all of which are hereinafter referred to as â€œdebts of \r\n  the Borrower.â€\r\n\r\nIn addition, Appellant waived certain rights by \r\n  signing the Guaranty:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expressly waives:Â  (a) notice of acceptance \r\n  of this guaranty and of all extensions of credit to the Borrower; (b) presentment \r\n  and demand for payment of any of the debts of the Borrower; (c) protest and \r\n  notice of dishonor or of default to the undersigned or to any other party with \r\n  respect to any of the debts of the Borrower or with respect to any security \r\n  therefore; (d) all other notices to which the undersigned might otherwise be \r\n  entitled; and (e) demand for payment under this guaranty.\r\n\r\nAppellant attempts to argue for the first \r\n  time on appeal that the July 17 agreement was incomplete at the time it was \r\n  signed.Â  It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on \r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be \r\n  preserved for appellate review.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, \r\n  76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998); accord Harris v. Bennett, 332 \r\n  S.C. 238, 245, 503 S.E.2d 782, 786 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Additionally, Appellant \r\n  has presented no evidence that the contract, which appears in the record completed, \r\n  was actually signed before it was completed.\r\nFinally, Appellant insists that while her signature \r\n  may be on the Guaranty Agreement, she never intended to enter into an agreement \r\n  for unlimited liability.Â  She was queried:Â  â€œDo you recall being asked to personally \r\n  guarantee that if they defaulted on one or more of the loans they had that you \r\n  would pay if they defaulted.â€Â  She answered:Â  â€œNo.â€Â  As noted above, Appellant \r\n  provides no legal authority for why her lack of understanding would provide \r\n  a means to rescind an otherwise valid contract.Â  \r\nEven if her contention is assumed to be \r\n  one of unilateral mistake, it is unavailing absent proof of fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, \r\n  concealment, or imposition of the party opposed to rescission.Â  See Truck \r\n  South, Inc. v. Patel, 339 S.C. 40, 49, 528 S.E.2d 424, 429 (2000) (â€œUnilateral \r\n  mistake is not by itself grounds for rescinding the contract unless the mistake \r\n  has been induced by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, concealment, or imposition \r\n  of the party opposed to rescission, without negligence on the part of the party \r\n  claiming rescission, or where mistake is accompanied by very strong and extraordinary \r\n  circumstances which would make it a great wrong to enforce the agreement.â€); \r\n  Alderman v. Bivin, 233 S.C. 545, 552, 106 S.E.2d 385, 389 (1958) (â€œA \r\n  contract may be reformed or rescinded . . . where the mistake is not mutual, \r\n  unilateral, and has been induced by the fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, concealment, \r\n  or imposition in any form of the party opposed in interest to the reformation \r\n  or rescission, without negligence on the part of the party claiming the right \r\n  . . . .â€).Â  Here, she fails to present evidence of her lack of understanding \r\n  as the basis for the unilateral mistake.Â  Additionally, Appellant averred that \r\n  she did not read the documents placed in front of her:\r\n\r\nQ. Did you look at the form where itâ€™s check marked by unlimited?\r\nA. Thatâ€™s right.\r\nQ. Did you ask anybody any questions as to why the check mark \r\n  was there?\r\nA. I never looked at it.Â  I have people come in the store \r\n  and buy boats, and they never read it.\r\nQ. They never read any of the forms?\r\nA. They never read it.\r\nQ. Is it fair to say that when you went to [Regions Bank] \r\n  and signed any of the documents that you signed that you didnâ€™t take the time \r\n  to study them?\r\nA. No I didnâ€™t.Â  I just trusted Richard [Furman].\r\nQ. And did you ever ask Mr. Furman what any of them meant?\r\nA. No.\r\n\r\nA person who signs a contract or other written document cannot \r\n  avoid the effect of the document by claiming he did not read it.Â  Sims v. \r\n  Tyler, 276 S.C. 640, 643, 281 S.E.2d 229, 230 (1981); Evans v. State \r\n  Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 269 S.C. 584, 587, 239 S.E.2d 76, 77 (1977).Â  A \r\n  person signing a document is responsible for reading the document and making \r\n  sure of its contents.Â  Every contracting party owes a duty to the other party \r\n  to the contract and to the public to learn the contents of a document before \r\n  he signs it.Â  Burwell v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 39, \r\n  340 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1986); Sanders v. Allis Chalmers Mfg. Co., 237 S.C. \r\n  133, 139-40, 115 S.E.2d 793, 796 (1960); Stanley Smith &amp; Sons v. D.M.R. \r\n  Inc., 307 S.C. 413, 417, 415 S.E.2d 428, 430 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  One who signs \r\n  a written instrument has the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect himself.Â  \r\n  Maw v.

Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina v. \r\n  Lanford, 313 S.C. 540, 545, 443 S.E.2d 549, 551 (1994).\r\nThis rule is subject to the exception that if the \r\n  party is ignorant and unwary, his failure to read the document may be excused.Â  \r\n  Burwell, 288 S.C. at 40, 340 S.E.2d at 789; Thomas v. Am. Workmen, \r\n  197 S.C. 178, 182, 14 S.E.2d 886, 887 (1941); Austin v. Indep. Life &amp; \r\n  Accident Ins. Co., 296 S.C. 156, 160, 370 S.E.2d 918, 921 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\n  However, our court very strictly construes this exception.Â  Burwell, \r\n  288 S.C. at 40, 340 S.E.2d at 789.Â  In determining whether a party can be classified \r\n  as ignorant and unwary, an individualâ€™s education, business experience and intelligence \r\n  are all considered.Â  Burwell, 288 S.C. at 40, 340 S.E.2d at 789-90; Thomas, \r\n  197 S.C. at 182, 14 S.E.2d at 888; Austin, 296 S.C. at 160, 370 S.E.2d \r\n  at 921.\r\nAdverting to Appellantâ€™s education, business experience \r\n  and intelligence, we refute any attempt to classify her as ignorant and unwary.Â  \r\n  Appellant has loaned money and co-signed loans for her son in the past.Â  She \r\n  has been involved in the operations of a business.Â  Furthermore, the literature \r\n  advertising her sonâ€™s businesses lists her as having over thirty years experience \r\n  in the marine business.Â  Appellant does not fall into this narrow exception; \r\n  and therefore, she cannot avoid the effect of the Guaranty Agreement by claiming \r\n  she did not read it.Â  \r\nFinally, Appellant made payments on the \r\n  notes.Â  The use of loan numbers on her checks indicated she paid on more than \r\n  one loan. Â The following colloquy elucidates her knowledge of the second loan:\r\n\r\nQ. Is it fair to say that somehow by putting that number on \r\n  those checks you knew there was another loan?\r\nA. I guess so.\r\n. . . .\r\nQ. Youâ€™ve got more than one loan number on your checks?\r\nA. Oh, Yeah, Iâ€™m sure.\r\nQ. When you put those on there, did you understand there was \r\n  more than one loan?\r\nA. I guess I did, there was more than one loan.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the \r\n  documents are unambiguous and clearly obligate Appellant to pay any sums due \r\n  under the second loan and its renewals to Martin Coleman.Â  She has failed to \r\n  provide any evidence indicating the contract should be rescinded and has not \r\n  proven her lack of understanding warranting rescission.Â  The trial court correctly \r\n  concluded Appellant signed the Guaranty Agreement and was bound to pay the balance \r\n  due on the second loan.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Pledge of Certificate of \r\n  Deposit [3] \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Intent to Pledge CD as \r\n  Collateral\r\nFirst, Appellant asserts she never pledged \r\n  her CD as collateral because she never signed the hypothecation agreement.Â  \r\n  During her deposition, she indicated the signature on the hypothecation agreement \r\n  was not hers.Â  She also introduced the testimony of Dawn Edwards, who was hired \r\n  as an expert in handwriting analysis: \r\n\r\nIf Ms. Schmauch was not impaired and there was not any other \r\n  physical or medical or use of medicines or anything of that nature, given the \r\n  45 documents that Iâ€™ve looked at that should show her natural variation in writing, \r\n  yes, Iâ€™d say that there would be more reason to believe that it was not her \r\n  genuine signature, if the other factors could be eliminated.\r\n\r\nEdwards professed that she briefly examined the \r\n  signatures.\r\nAdditionally in her report, Edwards conclusively \r\n  determines several signatures are those of Appellant, including the ones on \r\n  the May 30 and July 17 Guaranty Agreements.Â  However, regarding the hypothecation \r\n  agreement, she writes:Â  â€œA definite determination is precluded regarding the \r\n  . . . names.â€\r\nWe find, even if there is sufficient evidence \r\n  that a jury could consider the signature on the hypothecation agreement a forgery, \r\n  Appellant admitted (1) she pledged her CD; (2) she intended to pledge her CD \r\n  so Joe Schmauch could get the $100,000.00 loan; and (3) she signed papers to \r\n  pledge her CD.Â  Specifically, she testified:\r\n\r\nQ. When you went to [Regions Bank] with your son in connection \r\n  with the $100,000 loan, did you sign an agreement agreeing to pledge your certificate \r\n  of deposit?\r\nA. Yes, I did.\r\n. . . .\r\nA. I signed something.\r\nQ. And you understood that you were putting up your CD for \r\n  this loan?\r\nA. Right.\r\nQ. And your CD was how much?\r\nA. $100,000.\r\n. . . .\r\nQ. What did you think you were going [to the Bank] for?\r\nA. Well, to use my CD as security in case he didnâ€™t pay [the \r\n  first loan] back.\r\n. . . .\r\nQ. Did you think that you had to guarantee the loan?\r\nA. If he didnâ€™t pay it.\r\nQ. And how did you understand that you would have to do that \r\n  if he didnâ€™t pay it?\r\nA. Give him my CD, I guess.\r\n\r\nAppellant admitted not reading the papers placed \r\n  in front of her when she went to the bank to pledge her CD. \r\nBased upon her testimony, it is clear she intended \r\n  to and did in fact pledge her CD as collateral for the first loan.Â  She admitted \r\n  signing papers in order to pledge her CD.Â  The trial court correctly decided \r\n  she pledged her CD as collateral for the loan, and when the loan was not repaid, \r\n  Regions Bank had the right to collect payment.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Conversion\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court discussed \r\n  conversion in Crane v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 313 S.C. 70, 437 \r\n  S.E.2d 50 (1993):\r\n\r\nConversion is the unauthorized assumption and exercise of \r\n  the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, \r\n  to the alteration of the condition or the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  \r\n  To establish the tort of conversion, it is essential that the plaintiff establish \r\n  either title to or right to the possession of the personal property.Â Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 73, 437 S.E.2d at 52 (internal citations \r\n  omitted).Â  Conversion may arise by some illegal use or misuse, or by illegal \r\n  detention of anotherâ€™s personal property.Â  Owens v. Andrews Bank &amp; Trust \r\n  Co., 265 S.C. 490, 496, 220 S.E.2d 116, 119 (1975); Castell v. Stephenson \r\n  Fin. Co., 244 S.C. 45, 50-51, 135 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1964).Â  Conversion is \r\n  a wrongful act which emanates by either a wrongful taking or wrongful detention.Â  \r\n  Castell, 244 S.C. at 50-51, 135 S.E.2d at 313; Kirby v. Horne Motor \r\n  Co., 295 S.C. 7, 11, 366 S.E.2d 259, 261 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Apodictically, \r\n  Appellant must demonstrate she had the right to possess the CD at the time Regions \r\n  Bank liquidated it to satisfy the loan.Â  As we have recognized she pledged the \r\n  CD as collateral, she did not have the right to possession.Â  An action for conversion \r\n  may not lie.\r\nAppellantâ€™s contention that Regions Bank \r\n  failed to perfect the security interest is also without merit.Â  The CD was properly \r\n  pledged.Â  As such, the CD was in the possession of the Bank, and therefore, \r\n  the security interest was perfected under S.C. Code Ann. section 36-9-313(a) \r\n  (Supp. 2002) (â€œ[A] secured party may perfect a security interest in negotiable \r\n  documents, goods, instruments, money, or tangible chattel paper by taking possession \r\n  of the collateral.â€).\r\nThe trial court correctly concluded Appellant \r\n  pledged her CD as collateral on the first loan.Â  Additionally, Regions Bank \r\n  had a right to liquidate the CD once the balance on the first loan was due and \r\n  payable.Â  Finally, Respondents are not liable for conversion, as Appellant had \r\n  no right to possess the CD at the time of Regions Bankâ€™s assumption of the CD.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Negligence\r\nAppellant declares the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to Respondents on her negligence claim.Â  She asserts \r\n  Respondents owed her a duty of care because she was particularly vulnerable \r\n  in this situation and dependent on the bank for guidance.Â  She also maintains \r\n  the bank holds â€œan exalted public position and an extra measure of trust is \r\n  given to the Bankâ€ in the proper execution of loan documents.\r\nNegligence is the breach of a duty of care owed \r\n  to the plaintiff by the defendant.Â  Bell v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., \r\n  202 S.C. 160, 181, 24 S.E.2d 177, 186 (1943); Crawford v. Atl. Coast Line \r\n  R.R. Co., 179 S.C. 264, 270, 184 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1936).Â  To state a cause \r\n  of action for negligence, the plaintiff must allege facts which demonstrate: \r\n  (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant; (2) a breach of that duty by negligent \r\n  act or omission; and (3) resulting in damages to the plaintiff; and (4) the \r\n  damages proximately resulted from the breach of duty.Â  Thomasko v. Poole, \r\n  349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002); Kleckley v. Northwestern Natâ€™l \r\n  Cas. Co., 338 S.C. 131, 138, 526 S.E.2d 218, 221 (2000); Bergstrom v. \r\n  Palmetto Health Alliance, 352 S.C. 221, 229, 573 S.E.2d 805, 808-09 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  In determining whether a particular act is negligent, the test \r\n  used is what would a person of ordinary reason and prudence do under those circumstances \r\n  at that time and place.Â  See Spahn v. Town of Port Royal, 326 \r\n  S.C. 632, 637, 486 S.E.2d 507, 510 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding where motorist is \r\n  suddenly placed in an emergency situation, through no fault of his own, and \r\n  is compelled to act instantly to avoid a collision, he is not negligent if he \r\n  makes a choice that a person of ordinary judgment might make if placed in same \r\n  emergency situation).Â  The issue is what, if any, duty a bank owes a customer \r\n  in the regular course of its business.\r\nIn Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of \r\n  South Carolina v. Lanford, 313 S.C. 540, 443 S.E.2d 549 (1994), the supreme \r\n  court held the bank did not owe a duty to tell the guarantor that his liability \r\n  was for the entire loan amount.Â  The court explicated:Â  â€œThe law does not impose \r\n  a duty on the bank to explain to an individual what [she] could learn from simply \r\n  reading the document.â€Â  Id. at 545, 443 S.E.2d at 551.Â  Appellantâ€™s claim \r\n  that the bank was negligent in not ensuring she understood her liability is \r\n  equally unavailing. \r\nNext, Appellant claims Respondents were \r\n  negligent because they failed to require and ensure documents were properly \r\n  completed and to follow banking procedures for completing the documents.Â  Again, \r\n  if Appellant read the May 30 Guaranty, she would know it was incomplete.Â  In \r\n  any event, her liability is based on the July 17 Guaranty, which was properly \r\n  completed.Â  Appellant could not prove how the deficiency to complete the documents \r\n  proximately caused any of her alleged injuries.\r\nAppellant contends Respondents had a duty \r\n  to advise her about the financial condition of Martin Coleman.Â  However, in \r\n  PPG Indus., Inc. v. Orangeburg Paint &amp; Decorating Ctr., 297 S.C. \r\n  176, 375 S.E.2d 331 (Ct. App. 1988), this court found no obligation to notify \r\n  the guarantor of additional extensions of credit where the guaranty was continuing \r\n  and the guarantor waived the right to notice.Â  This is precisely the situation \r\n  at hand.Â  Appellant signed an unlimited guaranty for all current and future \r\n  debts of Martin Coleman.Â  She agreed to waive all notices to which she would \r\n  otherwise be entitled.Â  We find there was no duty to apprise Appellant of Martin \r\n  Colemanâ€™s obligations or the renewal of the loans.\r\nAppellant cites Jacques v. First Natâ€™l \r\n  Bank of Maryland, 515 A.2d 756 (Md. 1986) in support of her contention that \r\n  Respondents owed her a duty of care.Â  It involves a situation where the bank \r\n  erroneously told the plaintiffs they qualified for financing when they did not \r\n  qualify.Â  The plaintiffs were required to obtain financing at a higher rate.Â  \r\n  The court ruled, under the particular facts of the case, the bank owed plaintiffs \r\n  a duty of care in processing the application.Â  Even though the court relied \r\n  upon the fact that the bank holds a special position, this was in terms of processing \r\n  and approving financing.Â  The case did not establish an overall duty of care \r\n  between a bank and its customers.\r\nAppellant claims that she is in a vulnerable position \r\n  and is dependent on the Bank for guidance.Â  However, she was involved in the \r\n  operation of a business and as part of the literature advertising Joe Schmauchâ€™s \r\n  businesses, she is listed as having over thirty years experience in the marine \r\n  business.Â  Additionally, she had loaned money to her son in the past and had \r\n  guaranteed other loans.Â  Veritably, she was not in a vulnerable position, and \r\n  the bank owed her no special duty of care. \r\nIII. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach \r\n  of Fiduciary Duty\r\nAppellant argues there was a fiduciary \r\n  relationship between Respondents and herself.Â  She claims she placed her trust \r\n  in the Bank regarding her CD and also relied on Furman for advice and information \r\n  regarding her pledge of her CD and the guaranty of the second loan.Â  We disagree \r\n  and find no fiduciary relationship existed in this case.\r\nA fiduciary relationship is founded on the \r\n  trust and confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of \r\n  another.Â  Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, 293, 368 S.E.2d \r\n  91, 93 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œA fiduciary relationship exists when one reposes special \r\n  confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is \r\n  bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \r\n  confidence.â€Â  Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 \r\n  (1992); Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 599, 358 S.E.2d \r\n  150, 152 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  A relationship must be more than casual to equal \r\n  a fiduciary relationship.Â  Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, \r\n  293, 368 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nAs a general rule, a fiduciary relationship \r\n  cannot be established by the unilateral action of one party.Â  Brown v. Pearson, \r\n  326 S.C. 409, 423, 483 S.E.2d 477, 484 (Ct. App. 1997); Steele, 295 S.C. \r\n  at 295, 368 S.E.2d at 94.Â  The other party must have actually accepted or induced \r\n  the confidence placed in him.Â  Id.\r\nSouth Carolina holds the normal relationship between \r\n  a bank and its customer is one of creditor-debtor and not fiduciary in nature.Â  \r\n  Burwell v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 40, 340 S.E.2d 786, \r\n  790 (1986); Owens v. Andrews Bank &amp; Trust Co., 265 S.C. 490, 497, \r\n  220 S.E.2d 116, 119 (Ct. App. 1975); Johnson v. Serv. Mgmt., Inc., 319 \r\n  S.C. 165, 167-68, 459 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  However, a bank may \r\n  be held to a fiduciary duty if it undertakes to advise a depositor as part of \r\n  services the bank offers.Â  Burwell, 288 S.C. at 40, 340 S.E.2d at 790; \r\n  Rush v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 560, 562, 343 S.E.2d 667, \r\n  668 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Such a relationship charges the bank with a duty to disclose \r\n  material facts that may affect its customerâ€™s interests.Â  Burwell, 288 \r\n  S.C. at 40-41, 340 S.E.2d at 790.Â  Yet, no fiduciary relationship between a \r\n  bank and its depositor exists when the bank is unaware of any special trust \r\n  reposed in it.Â  Id.; Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, \r\n  294, 368 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThere is no evidence in this case that Appellant \r\n  placed a special trust in Furman or Regions Bank.Â  She was merely a depositor.Â  \r\n  She testified that she relied on no one before pledging her CD.Â  She admitted \r\n  never asking questions about the guaranty or any documents that she signed.Â  \r\n  Appellant has not demonstrated that Furman or anyone with Regions Bank undertook \r\n  to advise her as part of a service offered by the bank.Â Â  Indubitably, no fiduciary \r\n  relationship was created in this case.\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Fraud\r\nAppellant asserts Respondents committed \r\n  fraud by withholding information or providing her false information.Â  She argues \r\n  Respondents committed fraud by: (1) continuing to make loans based upon Appellantâ€™s \r\n  ability to pay with the intention to only collect from Appellant; (2) failing \r\n  to inform Appellant of Martin Colemanâ€™s financial condition; and (3) failing \r\n  to inform her that her liability was unlimited.Â  We disagree.Â  There is no evidence \r\n  to establish Respondents committed fraud. \r\nFraud is an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose \r\n  of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging \r\n  to her or to surrender a legal right.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 660 (6th ed. 1990).Â  \r\n  In order to prove fraud, the following elements must be shown: (1) a representation; \r\n  (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or \r\n  a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation \r\n  be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance \r\n  on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent \r\n  and proximate injury.Â  First State Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. \r\n  441, 446-47, 385 S.E.2d 821, 824 (1989); Moorhead v. First Piedmont Bank \r\n  &amp; Trust, 273 S.C. 356, 359, 256 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1979); Kiriakides \r\n  v.

App. 1993).Â  Each and every one of these elements must be proven by \r\n  clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.Â  First State Sav. &amp; Loan, \r\n  299 S.C. at 447, 385 S.E.2d at 824; Lundy v. Palmetto State Life Ins. Co., \r\n  256 S.C. 506, 510, 183 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1971).Â  The right to rely must be determined \r\n  in light of the plaintiffâ€™s duty to use reasonable prudence and diligence under \r\n  the circumstances in identifying the truth with respect to the representations \r\n  made to him.Â  Florentine Corp., Inc. v. PEDA I, Inc., 287 S.C. 382, 386, \r\n  339 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1985).Â  Moreover, there is no right to rely, as required \r\n  to establish fraud, where there is no confidential or fiduciary relationship \r\n  and there is an armâ€™s length transaction between mature, educated people.Â  This \r\n  is especially true in circumstances where one should have utilized precaution \r\n  and protection to safeguard his interests.Â  Florentine Corp., Inc., 287 \r\n  S.C. at 386, 339 S.E.2d at 114; Parks v. Morris Homes Corp., 245 S.C. \r\n  461, 467, 141 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1965) (holding a party has a duty to exercise \r\n  reasonable care to protect himself or herself against fraud by reading a contract \r\n  before he signs it); Outlaw v. Calhoun Life Ins. Co., 236 S.C. 272, 276, \r\n  113 S.E.2d 817, 819 (1960) (stating one cannot complain of fraud in misrepresentation \r\n  of contents of written instrument signed by her when the truth could have been \r\n  discovered by reading the instrument).Â  The principle of the right of reliance \r\n  upon representations is closely bound up with a duty on the part of the plaintiff \r\n  to use some measure of protection and precaution to safeguard his own interest.Â  \r\n  Thomas v. Am. Workmen, 197 S.C. 178, 182, 14 S.E.2d 886, 888 (1941). \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is largely because the law of fraud requires [a claimant] \r\n  to prove his ignorance of the falsity of the representation and his right to \r\n  rely on the falsity that the courts long ago established the rule that ordinarily \r\n  one cannot complain of fraud in the misrepresentation of the contents of a written \r\n  instrument signed by him when the truth could have been ascertained by reading \r\n  the instrument, and that one entering into a written contract must read it and \r\n  avail himself of every reasonable opportunity to understand its content and \r\n  meaning.\r\n\r\nPPG Indus., Inc. v. Orangeburg Paint &amp; Decorating \r\n  Ctr., Inc., 297 S.C. 176, 180, 375 S.E.2d 331, 333 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nAppellant could easily have determined for herself the extent \r\n  of her liability by reading the July 17 Guaranty.Â  It clearly enunciated that \r\n  she was guaranteeing all debts, present and future, and that her liability was \r\n  unlimited.Â  Appellant now cannot complain because the extent of her liability \r\n  was not explained to her by Respondents.\r\nAdditionally in the Guaranty, Appellant waived notice of \r\n  default by Martin Coleman on the debts.Â  She agreed to payment whether or not \r\n  demand was made of Martin Coleman.Â  Appellant made payments on the notes, as \r\n  evidenced by the checks entered into the record indicating multiple loan numbers.Â  \r\n  She knew Martin Coleman had not made all payments, and she made the payments \r\n  when Martin Coleman defaulted.\r\nFinally, Appellant cannot complain that Respondents did not \r\n  inform her of Martin Colemanâ€™s financial condition.Â  Non-disclosure is fraudulent \r\n  when there is a duty to speak.Â  Manning v. Dial, 271 S.C. 79, 83, 245 \r\n  S.E.2d 120, 122 (1978).Â  In Jacobson v. Yaschik, 249 S.C. 577, 585, 155 \r\n  S.E.2d 601, 605 (1967), the court announced the requirements for having a duty \r\n  to speak:\r\n\r\nThe duty to disclose may be reduced to three distinct classes: \r\n  (1) where it arises from a preexisting definite fiduciary relation between the \r\n  parties; (2) where one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the \r\n  other with reference to the particular transaction in question, or else from \r\n  the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position \r\n  towards each other, such a trust and confidence in the particular case is necessarily \r\n  implied; (3) where the very contract or transaction itself, in its essential \r\n  nature, is intrinsically fiduciary and necessarily calls for perfect good faith \r\n  and full disclosure without regard to any particular intention of the parties.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nLuculently, there are no fiduciary relationship and no expressed \r\n  repose of trust between the parties.Â  Additionally, Appellant could have easily \r\n  discerned the financial condition of Martin Coleman by asking her son, with \r\n  whom she had quite an involved financial relationship.Â  Appellant was required \r\n  to put forth her collateral in order for Martin Coleman to obtain the first \r\n  loan.Â  She was required to make payments on both the first and second loans \r\n  because Martin Coleman did not make the payments.Â  We do not see how Respondents \r\n  can be required to inform her of the financial condition of the company when \r\n  she could easily have obtained the information herself.\r\nWe hold Appellant had the opportunity to read the documents \r\n  she signed, and that in not doing so failed to exercise reasonable diligence \r\n  in protecting her own interest.Â  She had every opportunity to determine the \r\n  financial condition of Martin Coleman by asking her son.Â  Finally, according \r\n  to the Guaranty, Respondents had every right to seek payment from Appellant \r\n  without proceeding or issuing a demand against Martin Coleman.Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Equitable \r\n  Estoppel\r\nAppellant contends Respondents were estopped \r\n  from collecting payment from her because they did not provide her with information \r\n  regarding the extent of her liability and she believed she had limited liability.Â  \r\n  We find her claim to be without merit.\r\n\r\nElements of equitable estoppel as to the party estopped are:Â  \r\n  (1) conduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false representation or \r\n  concealment of material facts; (2) the intention that such conduct shall be \r\n  acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of \r\n  the true facts. Essential elements of estoppel as related to the party claiming \r\n  the estoppel are:Â  (1) lack of knowledge and of means of knowledge of truth \r\n  as to facts in question; (2) reliance upon conduct of the party estopped; and \r\n  (3) prejudicial change in position.Â Â  \r\n\r\nZabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. \r\n  580, 589, 553 S.E.2d 110, 114 (2001) (internal citations omitted).\r\nApplication of equitable estoppel does \r\n  not require an intentional misrepresentation.Â  It is sufficient if the plaintiff \r\n  reasonably relied upon the words or conduct of the defendant in allowing the \r\n  limitations period to expire.Â  Dillon County Sch. Dist. No. Two v. Lewis \r\n  Sheet Metal Works, Inc., 286 S.C. 207, 218-19, 332 S.E.2d 555, 561 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985) (overruled on other ground by Atlas Food Sys v.

Self Memâ€™l Hosp., 314 S.C. 305, 309, 443 S.E.2d 909, 911 (1994).Â  â€œOne \r\n  with knowledge of the truth or the means by which with reasonable diligence \r\n  he could acquire knowledge cannot claim to have been mis[led].â€Â  S.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In failing to read \r\n  the agreement or seek to understand the nature of her liability within the agreement, \r\n  she cannot claim to have been misled by Respondentsâ€™ silence regarding her liability \r\n  or any false statements regarding her liability.Â  The trial court was correct \r\n  in granting Respondents summary judgment on Appellantâ€™s equitable estoppel claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find Appellant intended to and did \r\n  pledge her CD as collateral for the first loan to Martin Coleman.Â  Regions Bank \r\n  and Appellant had a properly signed and completed Guaranty Agreement on July \r\n  17, 1996, providing for unlimited liability for all current and future debts \r\n  of Martin Coleman.Â  The trial court properly granted summary judgment to Regions \r\n  Bank for the amount due and payable on its collection action.Â  Next, we find \r\n  Appellant did not read the documents she signed, and if she had read the documents, \r\n  she would have been apprised of the nature of her liability and the waiver of \r\n  all notices due to her.Â  The trial court was correct in granting summary judgment \r\n  to Respondents on Appellantâ€™s counterclaims and third-party causes of action \r\n  for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, fraud, and equitable estoppel.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Regions Bank purchased Greenville National Bank.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Appellant also filed third-party causes of action against MCA, Martin \r\n    Coleman, Joe Schmauch, and Debra Coleman Schmauch.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Appellant maintains the trial court erred in granting summary judgment \r\n    regarding her liability on the first loan because Regions Bank never had a \r\n    security interest in the CD and therefore, had no right to the proceeds.Â  \r\n    She also contends the trial court erred in granting Respondentsâ€™ summary judgment \r\n    on her counterclaim and third-party action for conversion of the CD and interest.Â  \r\n    Because these claims relate to the same facts, they will be addressed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3652","title":"Flateau v.

Fielding, employees of the South Carolina Commission for the \r\n  Blind (Commission), appeal the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of their tort actions \r\n  against the following members of the Commissionâ€™s governing board: Robert M. \r\n  Harrelson, Oliver H. Willis, Stella G. Williams, E. Lynn W. Smith, and Earlene \r\n  S. Gardner (collectively, â€œthe Boardâ€).Â  On appeal, Flateau and Fielding argue \r\n  the court erred in finding: (1) the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (Act) provided \r\n  the exclusive remedy for Flateau and Fielding; (2) the Actâ€™s two-year statute \r\n  of limitations barred the actions; and (3) the Boardâ€™s failure to substitute \r\n  the Commission as a party precludes a finding that the causes of action of Flateau \r\n  and Fielding fall within the Actâ€™s auspices.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\nIn May 1998, the Board called Flateau \r\n  and Fielding to a hearing in the Commissionâ€™s Board Room.Â  Flateau and Fielding \r\n  entered the room at 10:00 a.m.Â  Flateau left at 2:30 p.m. to attend a \r\n  scheduled medical appointment.Â  Fielding remained in the room until 4:30 p.m.Â  \r\n  During the interim, they were not allowed to leave the room without a security \r\n  escort, nor were they permitted unaccompanied access to their offices.Â  Members \r\n  of the media were present.\r\nFlateau and Fielding filed separate \r\n  complaints in April 2001.Â  Their respective complaints identified each of them \r\n  as â€œan employee of the South Carolina Commission for the Blindâ€ at all relevant \r\n  times.Â  The pleadings further stated that â€œ[a]t the time of the incident \r\n  . . ., the Defendants were members of the Board of the South Carolina Commission \r\n  for the Blind.â€Â  In their complaints, Flateau and Fielding averred they â€œwere \r\n  commanded by Defendants to remain in the Board Room for the purposes of awaiting \r\n  an interview by Defendants, who had entered upon an executive session.â€Â  Flateau \r\n  and Fielding alleged causes of action for outrage, invasion of privacy, and \r\n  civil conspiracy.\r\nThe Board filed motions to dismiss \r\n  the actions pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The Board argued: (1) Flateau \r\n  and Fielding failed to assert in their pleadings that the Boardâ€™s members acted \r\n  outside the scope of their duties; (2) the Act provided the exclusive remedy \r\n  for Flateau and Fielding; (3) the causes of action were barred by the Actâ€™s \r\n  two-year statute of limitations; (4) the two-year statute of limitations applied \r\n  â€œeven if the complaint had alleged that the defendants acted outside the scope \r\n  of their dutiesâ€; and (5) neither Flateau nor Fielding filed a verified claim \r\n  that would extend the statute of limitations to three years.Â  The court granted \r\n  the motions to dismiss.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.Â  Did the circuit court err in \r\n    finding the Act applied to the case at bar?\r\n  II.Â  Did the circuit court err \r\n    in finding the Actâ€™s two-year statute of limitations barred the causes of \r\n    action brought by Flateau and Fielding?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant \r\n  may move to dismiss based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute \r\n  a cause of action.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  69 (1999); Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 352 S.C. 221, 573 S.E.2d \r\n  805 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A trial judge in the civil setting may dismiss a claim \r\n  when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient \r\n  to constitute a cause of action in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Williams \r\n  v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Generally, in \r\n  considering a 12(b)(6) motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon \r\n  allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.Â  Stiles v. Onorato, \r\n  318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995); Bergstrom, 352 S.C. at 233, 573 \r\n  S.E.2d at 811; see also Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 353 \r\n  S.E.2d 697 (1987) (trial court must dispose of motion for failure to state cause \r\n  of action based solely upon allegations set forth on face of complaint); Williams, \r\n  347 S.C. at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 499 (trial courtâ€™s ruling on 12(b)(6) motion \r\n  must be bottomed and premised solely upon allegations set forth by plaintiff).\r\nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n  should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom \r\n  would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.Â  See \r\n  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 522 S.E.2d 137 (1999); Stiles, 318 \r\n  S.C. at 300, 457 S.E.2d at 602-03; see also Baird, 333 S.C. at \r\n  527, 511 S.E.2d at 73 (if the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged \r\n  on the complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the \r\n  grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper); McCormick \r\n  v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1997) (motion to dismiss \r\n  cannot be sustained if facts alleged in complaint and inferences reasonably \r\n  deducible therefrom would entitle plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case).Â  \r\n  In deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, \r\n  this Court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.Â  See Gentry, \r\n  337 S.C. at 5, 522 S.E.2d at 139; see also Cowart v. Poore, 337 \r\n  S.C. 359, 523 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1999) (looking at facts in light most favorable \r\n  to plaintiff, and with all doubts resolved in his behalf, the court must consider \r\n  whether the pleadings articulate any valid claim for relief).\r\nThe complaint should not be dismissed \r\n  merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  Toussaint \r\n  v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987).Â  The trial courtâ€™s grant of a \r\n  motion to dismiss will be sustained if the facts alleged in the complaint do \r\n  not support relief under any theory of law.Â  Tatum v. Medical Univ. of South \r\n  Carolina, 346 S.C. 194, 552 S.E.2d 18 (2001); see also Gray v. \r\n  State Farm Auto Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 646, 491 S.E.2d 272 (Ct. App. 1997) (motion \r\n  must be granted if facts and inferences reasonably deducible from them show \r\n  that plaintiff could not prevail on any theory of the case).\r\nâ€œDismissal of an action pursuant \r\n  to Rule 12(b)(6) is appealable.â€Â  Williams, 347 at 233, 553 S.E.2d at \r\n  500.Â  Upon review of a dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the \r\n  appellate court applies the same standard of review implemented by the trial \r\n  court.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nI.Â  TORT CLAIMS \r\n  ACT \r\nFlateau and Fielding contend that \r\n  because they stated a valid claim of relief, the trial courtâ€™s decision to dismiss \r\n  their causes of action under the Act was erroneous.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort \r\n  claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available \r\n  in an action against a governmental entity or its employees.Â  See Murphy \r\n  v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 317 S.C. 560, 455 S.E.2d 688 (1995); Wells v. \r\n  City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThe remedy \r\n  provided by [the Tort Claims Act] is the exclusive civil remedy available for \r\n  any tort committed by a governmental entity, its employees, or its agents \r\n  except as provided in Â§ 15-78-70(b).â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(b) (Supp. 2002) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  â€œ[The Tort Claims Act] constitutes the exclusive remedy for \r\n  any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(a) (Supp. 2002) (emphasis added).Â  According to the Act, â€œ[n]otwithstanding \r\n  any provision of law, this chapter, the â€˜South Carolina Tort Claims Act,â€™ is \r\n  the exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee \r\n  of a governmental entity while acting within the scope of the employeeâ€™s official \r\n  duty.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-200 (Supp. 2002) (emphasis added).\r\nSection \r\n  15-78-70(a) provides in part that â€œ[a]n employee of a governmental entity who \r\n  commits a tort while acting within the scope of his official duty is not liable \r\n  therefor except as expressly provided for in subsection (b).â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-70(a) (Supp. 2002).Â  Subsection (b) declares: â€œNothing in this chapter \r\n  may be construed to give an employee of a governmental entity immunity from \r\n  suit and liability if it is proved that the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within \r\n  the scope of his official duties or that it constituted actual fraud, actual \r\n  malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. 2002).\r\nThe Act defines a â€œ[g]overnmental \r\n  entityâ€ as â€œthe State and its political subdivisions.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(d) \r\n  (Supp. 2002).Â  The State â€œmeans the State of South Carolinaâ€ and includes its \r\n  commissions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(e) (Supp. 2002).Â  In the present case, \r\n  the Actâ€™s definition of an â€œemployeeâ€ refers to â€œany officer, employee, or agent \r\n  of the State or its political subdivisions, including elected or appointed officials, \r\n  law enforcement officers, and persons acting on behalf or in service of a governmental \r\n  entity in the scope of official duty.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(c) (Supp. \r\n  2002).Â  â€œâ€˜Scope of official dutyâ€™ or â€˜scope of state employmentâ€™ means (1) acting \r\n  in and about the official business of a governmental entity and (2) performing \r\n  official duties.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(i) (Supp. 2002).\r\n The Act \r\n  is intended to cover those actions committed by an employee within the scope \r\n  of the employeeâ€™s official duty.Â  â€œThe provisions of [the Act] establishing \r\n  limitations on and exemptions to the liability of the State, its political subdivisions, \r\n  and employees, while acting within the scope of official duty, must be liberally \r\n  construed in favor of limiting the liability of the State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-20(f) (Supp. 2002); see also Wade v. Berkeley County, \r\n  330 S.C. 311, 498 S.E.2d 684 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting that Â§ 15-78-20(f) limits \r\n  coverage to employees acting within the scope of official duty).\r\nHere, it is undisputed that the Commission \r\n  is a â€œgovernmental entityâ€ within the meaning of the Act.Â  Furthermore, despite \r\n  the contention in the brief of Flateau and Fielding, nowhere in their complaints \r\n  do Flateau and Fielding allege that the Board membersâ€™ actions were outside \r\n  the scope of their official duty.Â  On the contrary, the complaints specifically \r\n  aver: (1) â€œ[a]t the time of the incident . . ., the Defendants were members \r\n  of the Board of the South Carolina Commission for the Blindâ€; (2) Flateau and \r\n  Fielding were, â€œat the time of the incident set forth [in the complaint,] . \r\n  . . employee[s] of the South Carolina Commission for the Blindâ€; (3) â€œ[a]t 10:00 \r\n  oâ€™clock a.m. on or about May 1, 1998 the Defendants did command [Flateau and \r\n  Fielding] and other employees to attend a hearing in the Board Room of the offices \r\n  of the South Carolina Commission for the Blindâ€; (4) â€œ[u]pon arriving at the \r\n  Board Room, [Flateau and Fielding] and other employees were commanded by Defendants \r\n  to remain in the Board Room for the purposes of awaiting an interview by Defendants, \r\n  who had entered upon an executive session in an ante-room in the buildingâ€; \r\n  (5) the incident occurred during regular business hours and in the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  boardroom; (6) the Board â€œcommandedâ€ Flateau and Fielding to behave in a certain \r\n  manner, and they complied with the Boardâ€™s requests; and (7) the â€œDefendantsâ€™ \r\n  command that [Flateau and Fielding] be restrained in the Board Room of the [Commission] \r\n  without leave to depart was made by the combination of them voting for those \r\n  restrictions upon [Flateauâ€™s and Fieldingâ€™s] personal freedom and access to \r\n  movement.â€\r\nThe complaints assert tort claims \r\n  against Commission board members who acted on behalf of the Commission in commanding \r\n  Commission employees, including Flateau and Fielding, to attend a hearing for \r\n  the purpose of being interviewed by the Board.Â  The pleadings clearly and unequivocally \r\n  allege that the Board members were meeting and acting together as the South \r\n  Carolina Commission for the Blind, discussing matters in executive session, \r\n  and voting in their capacity as Commissioners to take the actions in questionâ€”all \r\n  official duties and actions that are about the official business of the Commission, \r\n  which is a public body established by the General Assembly.Â  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 43-25-10 (1985) (creating the South Carolina Commission for the \r\n  Blind; stating that chairman of Commission may call meeting whenever he deems \r\n  it necessary); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-20 (1991) (defining â€œpublic bodyâ€ to include \r\n  state commissions).Â  Requiring Flateau and Fielding to attend a hearing and \r\n  holding them there, as Flateau and Fielding maintain in their complaints, may \r\n  be argued to go beyond the authority of the Commission, but it does not \r\n  bring the Commissionersâ€™ actions outside the scope of their official duty.Â  \r\n  See Crittenden v. Thompson-Walker Co., 288 S.C. 112, 341 S.E.2d \r\n  385 (Ct. App. 1986) (distinguishing scope of servantâ€™s employment from scope \r\n  of servantâ€™s authority and holding acts outside servantâ€™s authority are still \r\n  within his scope of duty if done in furtherance of masterâ€™s business).\r\nThe complaints of Flateau and Fielding \r\n  allege torts committed by the Board members while acting within the scope of \r\n  their official duty.Â  The Tort Claims Act explicitly provides the sole and exclusive \r\n  remedy for torts committed by employees of a governmental entity.Â  We find the \r\n  claims of Flateau and Fielding are subject to the Tort Claims Act.\r\nBecause we have concluded that the \r\n  causes of action alleged by Flateau and Fielding against the Board members constituted \r\n  conduct within the scope of the Board membersâ€™ official duty, there can be no \r\n  liability of individual members of the South Carolina Commission for the Blind.Â  \r\n  The statutory dialectic reveals that a governmental employee acting within the \r\n  scope of official duty is exempt from personal liability.\r\nThe contentions of Flateau and Fielding \r\n  fly in the face of logical argumentation in that the efficacy of the Tort Claims \r\n  Act is protection of governmental employees acting in the scope of official \r\n  duties.Â  The remedy mandated in the Act is legal action initiated against the \r\n  governmental entity rather than the individual governmental employee.\r\nFlateau and Fielding maintain that \r\n  the failure by the Board members to substitute the Commissionâ€™s name for their \r\n  names as a party defendant pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(c) removes \r\n  their litigation from the auspices of the Tort Claims Act.Â  We find this argument \r\n  unavailing.\r\n \r\n  Section 15-78-70(c) provides in \r\n    pertinent part:\r\n  [A] person, when bringing an action \r\n    against a governmental entity under the provisions of this chapter, shall \r\n    name as a party defendant only the agency or political subdivision for which \r\n    the employee was acting and is not required to name the employee individually, \r\n    unless the agency or political subdivision for which the employee was acting \r\n    cannot be determined at the time the action is instituted.Â  In the event that \r\n    the employee is individually named, the agency or political subdivision for \r\n    which the employee was acting must be substituted as the party defendant.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(c) (Supp. \r\n  2002).Â  â€œWhen a plaintiff claims an employee of a state agency acted negligently \r\n  in the performance of his job, the South Carolina Tort Claims Act requires a \r\n  plaintiff to sue the agency for which an employee works, rather than suing the \r\n  employee directly.â€Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, \r\n  350 S.C. 315, 321 n.1, 566 S.E.2d 536, 539 n.1 (2002) (citing S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-70(c)).Â  This language places no burden on the employee to substitute \r\n  as a party defendant the state agency for which he or she is employed.\r\nConcomitantly, in viewing these facts \r\n  in the light most favorable to each plaintiff, and resolving all doubts in their \r\n  behalf, we find that the Act provided the exclusive remedy for the conduct alleged \r\n  by Flateau and Fielding.\r\n\r\nII.Â  \r\n  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\r\n\r\nFlateau and Fielding \r\n  argue that the Actâ€™s two-year statute of limitations should not bar their causes \r\n  of action because they did not bring the actions pursuant to the Act.Â  Flateau \r\n  and Fielding claim the gravamen of their position is that the actions were not \r\n  brought pursuant to the Tort Claims Act; instead, the suits allege common law \r\n  causes of action for outrage, invasion of privacy, and civil conspiracy against \r\n  individual defendants.\r\nSection 15-78-110 of the \r\n  Act provides a two-year statute of limitations for most actions:\r\n\r\nExcept as provided for in Section \r\n  15-3-40, any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless \r\n  an action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should \r\n  have been discovered; provided, that if the claimant first filed a claim pursuant \r\n  to this chapter then the action for damages based upon the same occurrence is \r\n  forever barred unless the action is commenced within three years of the date \r\n  the loss was or should have been discovered.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. \r\n  2002).Â  A three-year statute of limitations is available to a party who files \r\n  a â€œverified claim.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-80 (Supp. 2002); see \r\n  also Joubert v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2000) (if plaintiff files statutorily-defined claim within \r\n  one year of loss or injury, statute of limitations is extended to three years).Â  \r\n  Section 15-78-80 expressly requires the party to file a verified claim in order \r\n  to benefit from the three-year limitations period.Â  Joubert, 341 S.C. \r\n  at 186, 534 S.E.2d at 6.Â  In order to trigger the three-year statute of limitations \r\n  under Â§ 15-78-110, a party must follow the procedure outlined in Â§ 15-78-80.Â  \r\n  Id. at 187, 534 S.E.2d at 6.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act controls \r\n  the instant case.Â  The record contains no evidence that Flateau or Fielding \r\n  filed a verified claim.Â  Accordingly, the three-year statute of limitations \r\n  does not apply.Â  Rather, the two-year statute of limitations is applicable.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) \r\n  articulates: â€œNothing in this chapter may be construed to give an employee of \r\n  a governmental entity immunity from suit and liability if it is proved that \r\n  the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that \r\n  it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving \r\n  moral turpitude.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. 2002).Â  This statutory \r\n  provision lifts the immunity normally enjoyed by governmental employees if they \r\n  act outside the scope of their employment or their actions constitute fraud, \r\n  malice, an intent to harm, or a crime of moral turpitude.Â  Absolutely nothing \r\n  in subsection (b) references a limitations period and, as part of the general \r\n  Tort Claims Act statutory scheme, it is subject to the Actâ€™s statute of limitations \r\n  as prescribed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110.\r\nThe incident occurred in \r\n  May 1998.Â  Flateau and Fielding filed their actions in April 2001, nearly three \r\n  years later.Â  Thus, the circuit court did not err in finding the Actâ€™s two-year \r\n  statute of limitations barred the causes of action asserted by Flateau and Fielding.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the complaints \r\n  of Flateau and Fielding allege torts committed by the Board members while acting \r\n  within the scope of their official duty.Â  The Tort Claims Act provides the exclusive \r\n  remedy for torts committed by an employee of a governmental entity while acting \r\n  within the scope of the employeeâ€™s official duty.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-200 (Supp. 2002).Â  Thus, the claims of Flateau and Fielding are governed \r\n  by the Tort Claims Act.Â  Further, Â§ 15-78-70(c) placed no burden on the Board \r\n  members to substitute the Commissionâ€™s name for their names as a party defendant.\r\nWe rule the two-year statute of limitations \r\n  applies even if the Board members acted outside the scope of their official \r\n  duties or if their actions constituted fraud, actual malice, intent to cause \r\n  harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.\r\nThe order of the circuit court dismissing \r\n  the actions filed by Flateau and Fielding is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n CURETON and HUFF, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3653","title":"State v.

McDonnel, of Columbia; \r\n  Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville; for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, \r\n  J.:Â  Uuno Mattias â€œMattâ€ Baum was convicted of the murder of his stepfather, \r\n  Randall Pinion, and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  Baum appeals his conviction \r\n  contending that his prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of \r\n  the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October \r\n  26, 1999, Randall Pinion went to his bank and filled out an affidavit of forgery \r\n  concerning two checks in the amount of $450.00 apiece and made out to Matt Baum.Â  \r\n  The bank employee who assisted Pinion gave him the original affidavit of forgery \r\n  and instructed him to take it to the police if he desired to prosecute.Â  On \r\n  October 27, 1999, two days prior to Pinionâ€™s disappearance, he arrived at work \r\n  upset and told a co-worker that Matt Baum, Pinionâ€™s stepson, had stolen some \r\n  money from him.Â  Pinion told the co-worker he would give Baum two days to repay \r\n  the money or he was going to turn Baum in to the police.Â  On the morning of \r\n  his disappearance, Pinion stated to the co-worker that he was giving Baum until \r\n  that evening to give him his money.Â  Pinion never filed a police report in regard \r\n  to the alleged forgeries.Â  Two weeks earlier, Baum threatened to kill Pinion \r\n  after Pinion had physically abused Baumâ€™s mother.Â  \r\nOn Friday, \r\n  October 29, 1999, Pinion disappeared after leaving work.Â  His black pickup truck \r\n  was not at his home on Friday night or Saturday morning, but appeared at his \r\n  house between 3:00 and 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 30.Â  Between 4:00 and \r\n  7:00 p.m. on Sunday October 31, the truck again disappeared from the house.Â  \r\n  Pinionâ€™s truck was subsequently found in a church parking lot a few days later.Â  \r\n  \r\nOn November \r\n  1, 1999, Baum sold a set of Taylor Made golf clubs to a sporting goods store, \r\n  explaining they belonged to his stepfather, who had passed away and left him \r\n  the clubs.Â  Pinion owned several sets of golf clubs, including a Taylor Made \r\n  set.Â  \r\nPolice \r\n  investigated Pinionâ€™s home and pickup truck and found Pinionâ€™s blood in various \r\n  places throughout his home, as well as in the bed of his pickup truck.Â  The \r\n  police also found a bloody shoe print inside Pinionâ€™s home.Â  The police concluded \r\n  that Pinion had been beaten to death inside of his home and someone thereafter \r\n  attempted to clean up the crime scene.Â  \r\nBased on their investigation, the authorities developed Baum as a suspect in \r\n  Pinionâ€™s disappearance.Â  On November 7, 1999, after receiving a tip on his possible \r\n  location, police attempted to apprehend Baum as he fled in a white pickup truck.Â  \r\n  The chase reached speeds of more than 100 miles per hour, and ended when the \r\n  white truck became disabled following a traffic accident.Â  When the police searched \r\n  the disabled truck they discovered the keys to Pinionâ€™s truck, a couple of Pinionâ€™s \r\n  checks, Baumâ€™s driverâ€™s license, and a pair of tennis shoes whose tread was \r\n  consistent with the bloody shoe print found inside Pinionâ€™s home.Â  \r\nOn November 11, 1999, the grand jury returned a true bill against Baum for Pinionâ€™s \r\n  murder, even though the police had not found Pinionâ€™s body.Â  Baumâ€™s trial began \r\n  on October 9, 2000, and the jury was sworn on that day.Â  After Court recessed \r\n  for the evening, the Easley Police Department was notified of the discovery \r\n  of an unidentified, decomposed body found on October 7, 2000 in McDowell County, \r\n  North Carolina.Â  The following day, the solicitor informed defense counsel and \r\n  the court that the State had evidence it was, in fact, the body of Randall Pinion.Â  \r\n  The State moved for a mistrial or a continuance based upon the discovery of \r\n  Pinionâ€™s body.Â  Baumâ€™s counsel did not agree with the State and asserted they \r\n  were ready to proceed to trial.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted the Stateâ€™s motion for a mistrial finding it was imperative \r\n  the jury charged with deciding the case be given all relevant evidence upon \r\n  which to base its decision.Â  The court concluded there was a possibility that \r\n  exculpatory evidence would be revealed and that the discovery of Pinionâ€™s body \r\n  constituted manifest necessity to grant a mistrial.Â  Baumâ€™s second trial began \r\n  on January 22, 2001, at which time Baum objected to the new trial and moved \r\n  the State be barred from proceeding to trial on the ground that it violated \r\n  the Double Jeopardy Clause.Â  The circuit court denied Baumâ€™s motion and Baum \r\n  was subsequently convicted for Pinionâ€™s murder.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBaum \r\n  argues the circuit court erred when it allowed the second trial to proceed because \r\n  the discovery of Pinionâ€™s body did not constitute manifest necessity to justify \r\n  a mistrial, and therefore, the second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy \r\n  Clause.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions \r\n  prevent all citizens from being placed twice in jeopardy of life and liberty.Â  \r\n  See U.S. Const. amend. V (â€œNo person shall be . . . subject for the same \r\n  offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . â€); S.C. Const. art. \r\n  I, Â§ 12 (â€œNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in \r\n  jeopardy of life or liberty . . . â€).Â  The Fifth Amendment of the United States \r\n  Constitution is made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment \r\n  due process clause.Â  See Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794 \r\n  (1969) (â€œ[T]he double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents \r\n  a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and . . . should apply to \r\n  the States through the Fourteenth Amendmentâ€).Â  Pursuant to the Double Jeopardy \r\n  Clause, a defendant is protected from (1) prosecution for the same offense after \r\n  acquittal, (2) prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and (3) multiple \r\n  prosecution for the same offense after an improvidently granted mistrial.Â  State \r\n  v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 27-28, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977).Â  \r\nGenerally, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn and impaneled, unless the \r\n  defendant consents to the juryâ€™s discharge before it reaches a verdict or legal \r\n  necessity mandates the juryâ€™s discharge.Â  State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. \r\n  454, 457, 539 S.E.2d 717, 718 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nUnlike \r\n  the situation in which the trial has ended in an acquittal or conviction, retrial \r\n  is not automatically barred when a criminal proceeding is terminated without \r\n  finally resolving the merits of the charges against the accused.Â  Because of \r\n  the variety of circumstances that may make it necessary to discharge a jury \r\n  before a trial is concluded, and because those circumstances do not invariably \r\n  create unfairness to the accused, his valued right to have the trial concluded \r\n  by a particular tribunal is sometimes subordinate to the public interest in \r\n  affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence \r\n  to an impartial jury.\r\n\r\nArizona \r\n  v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978).Â  The test to determine whether \r\n  sound grounds exist for declaring a mistrial after the jury is sworn is â€œwhether \r\n  the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the ends of public justice, \r\n  the latter being defined as the publicâ€™s interest in a fair trial designated \r\n  to end in just judgment.â€Â  State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d \r\n  471, 472 (1983).\r\nâ€œManifest \r\n  necessityâ€ is not a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention \r\n  to the particular problem confronting the trial judge.Â  Further, the word â€œnecessityâ€ \r\n  is not to be interpreted literally.Â  Arizona, 434 U.S. at 505-06.Â  Rather, \r\n  there need only be a â€œhigh degreeâ€ of necessity in order to conclude that a \r\n  mistrial is appropriate under the circumstances.Â  Id. at 506.Â  Whether \r\n  a mistrial is mandated by manifest necessity is a fact specific inquiry.Â  Rowlands, \r\n  343 S.C. at 457, 539 S.E.2d at 719.Â  Given the â€œvarying and often unique situations \r\n  arising during the course of a criminal trial,â€ the United States Supreme Court \r\n  has recognized a broad discretion reserved to a trial judge in declaring a mistrial.Â  \r\n  Kirby, 269 S.C. at 29, 236 S.E.2d at 35 (quoting Illinois v. Somerville, \r\n  410 U.S. 458, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973)).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision \r\n  to grant a mistrial will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law.Â  Rowlands, 343 S.C. at 458, 539 S.E.2d at 719.\r\nBaum asserts, \r\n  however, that the State sought a mistrial to simply marshal evidence to strengthen \r\n  its case against him, and that the grant of a mistrial on such basis is clearly \r\n  prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause.Â  We agree that, as it has evolved \r\n  in this country, the prohibition against double jeopardy is intended to condemn \r\n  the practice of the prosecution requesting a mistrial for the sole purpose of \r\n  buttressing weakness in its evidence, and the strictest of scrutiny is appropriate \r\n  when the basis for a mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution \r\n  evidence.Â  Arizona, 434 U.S. at 507-08.Â  However, we do not believe the \r\n  facts of this case warrant the conclusion that this was the reason behind the \r\n  granting of the mistrial.Â  \r\nFirst, we cannot say the body of the victim in this case was critical \r\n  evidence in the prosecution of Baum such that its unavailability triggers the \r\n  strict scrutiny announced in Arizona.Â  As noted by Baum, the fact that \r\n  Randall Pinion had been murdered was not in issue.Â  At any rate, we conclude \r\n  the discovery of the body of a victim during a murder trial, is an extremely \r\n  important piece of evidence which has just as much potential to exonerate as \r\n  to inculpate an accused.Â  The judge recognized as much, and found that the publicâ€™s \r\n  interest in a fair adjudication was implicated by the possibility of discovering \r\n  exculpatory evidence and giving the jury the benefit of the fully developed \r\n  facts when deciding the matter.Â  Consequently, we believe manifest necessity \r\n  was clearly established, and find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  determination that a mistrial was dictated by such.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Baumâ€™s conviction is\r\n \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3655","title":"Daves v.

Cleary began \r\n    treating Daves.Â Â  Daves repeatedly told Cleary that he was having a heart \r\n    attack, but Cleary believed Daves was either suffering from gallbladder pain \r\n    or some other gastrointestinal disorder.Â Â  Daves informed Cleary that his \r\n    gallbladder had been removed years before and that he was positive he was \r\n    having a heart attack.Â Â  Cleary continued to insist that Daves was not having \r\n    a heart attack, and he thumped on Davesâ€™s chest and remarked â€œits not your \r\n    ticker.â€Â  An EKG performed onÂ  Daves failed to show any acute changes to his \r\n    condition.Â Â Â Â  A test performed at 10:30 a.m. showed normal levels of cardiac \r\n    enzymes.Â Â Â  \r\n  As the morning progressed, Cleary treated Daves for \r\n    a gastrointestinal irritation and ran tests to determine if Daves had gallstones \r\n    in his common bile duct.Â Â  When nitroglycerin failed to relieve Davesâ€™s pain, \r\n    Cleary administered an anti-anxiety drug which made Daves lose consciousness.Â  \r\n    Â Â Daves does not recall what happened during that time, but remembers \r\n    that every time he woke up he was in severe pain.Â Â  \r\n  Daves remained in the emergency room and was not admitted \r\n    into the hospital until 2:30 that afternoon.Â Â Â  Dr. Cole, his primary physician, \r\n    did not see him until 6:00 p.m., at which point a cardiac enzyme test indicated \r\n    that Daves had suffered from a massive heart attack.Â  Daves began to receive \r\n    treatment for the heart attack, but by this point severe damage to his heart \r\n    muscles had already occurred, resulting in congestive heart failure.Â Â Â  As \r\n    a result of his condition, Daves underwent two heart catheterizations, three \r\n    thoracentesis procedures in order to drain fluid from his lungs, and also \r\n    a triple bypass operation.Â Â Â  Daves has been disabled since his March 25, \r\n    1996 heart attack. His medical bills total $139,967.91. \r\n  Daves sued Cleary, the hospital, and his primary \r\n    physician for medical negligence and personal injury.Â  Jane sued the same \r\n    defendants for loss of consortium. [1]   \r\n  Dr. David Maron testified as an expert witness \r\n    for Daves.Â  He stated that because cardiac enzymes showing heart damage may \r\n    take up to two hours to manifest, Cleary violated the standard of care for \r\n    emergency room physicians treating a patient with chest pains when he failed \r\n    to order repeated EKGâ€™s and repeated cardiac enzyme tests to monitor a developing \r\n    heart attack in time to appropriately treat it.Â  According to Maron, Clearyâ€™s \r\n    failure to adequately check Davesâ€™s vital signs, failure to adequately check \r\n    Davesâ€™s medical history regarding gallbladder surgery, failure to request \r\n    a cardiac consult, and failure to administer any clot-dissolving medication \r\n    fell below the standard of care for an emergency room doctor.Â  \r\n  The jury found for Daves and against Cleary on the medical \r\n    malpractice claim and awarded him $500,000 in actual damages, but it also \r\n    found for the primary physician and the hospital on the negligence claim.Â Â  \r\n    The jury initially found for Jane on the loss of consortium claim against \r\n    Cleary, but it awarded her $0 in damages.Â  The circuit court refused to accept \r\n    the loss of consortium verdict, instructing the jury that it either had to \r\n    find for Jane and award her at least a nominal amount of damages or find in \r\n    favor of Cleary.Â Â  The jury returned with a verdict in favor of Cleary, the \r\n    hospital, and the primary physician as to Janeâ€™s loss of consortium claim.Â Â  \r\n    This appeal follows.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  I.Â  JURY CHARGE \r\n  Cleary argues the circuit court erred in improperly \r\n    charging the juryÂ  on the standard of care for physicians.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Cleary submitted several requests to charge to the circuit \r\n    court regarding the standard of care.Â Â  In four of the requests to charge, \r\n    Cleary asked the court to charge that Daves was required to show the recognized \r\n    practices and procedures which would be exercised by a competent practitioner \r\n    â€œin the defendant doctorâ€™s field of medicine,â€Â  â€œin the same specialty,â€ â€œin \r\n    the particular branch of healing art in whichâ€ the defendant doctor is trained, \r\n    or of a â€œparticular school of thought,â€ under the same or similar circumstances.Â Â Â  \r\n    Cleary requested that the circuit court charge the jury the specific language \r\n    that a physician is held to the standard of care of a competent physician \r\n    in his field of medicine or area of medical specialty.Â Â Â  The trial judge \r\n    denied Clearyâ€™s request, stating that he believed the charge he intended to \r\n    give the jury addressed the â€œfield of medicineâ€ issue, although not as specifically \r\n    as Cleary would have liked.Â Â  The judge then read the following charges to \r\n    the jury regarding the standard of care:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Malpractice, by definition, is the failure to diagnose, \r\n    treat, or care for a patient in accordance with good proper accepted medical \r\n    practice resulting in harm to the patient.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  What the law requires is that in the practice of his \r\n    vocation he will exercise that degree of knowledge, care and skill ordinarily \r\n    possessed by members of his profession in good standingÂ  under the same or \r\n    similar circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  He would also be liable, if having the requisite skill, \r\n    he negligently fails to use it or he is not as careful and diligent in the \r\n    diagnosis, treatment or care to the extent that he should be, which is to \r\n    say as a careful and diligent physician of ordinary prudence would have been \r\n    under the same circumstance.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a case such as this, negligence is the failure to \r\n    do that which an ordinary careful and prudent physician would do under the \r\n    same circumstances, or it is the doing of that which an ordinary - ordinarily \r\n    prudent physician would not have done under the existing circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The standard, which I have already told you - the standard \r\n    is that which I have already told you. Â Did the physician exercise that degree \r\n    of knowledge, care and skill possessed by the members of his profession in \r\n    good standing similarly situated under the same or similar circumstances.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  What are the generally recognized and accepted practices \r\n    and procedures which would be followed by the average competent practitioners \r\n    in the defendantâ€™s profession under the same or similar circumstances; two, \r\n    in what manner, if any, he departed from such practices or procedures; and, \r\n    three, was the defendantâ€™s departure from such generally recognized practices \r\n    and procedures, if any, a proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s alleged injuries \r\n    or damages?Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  After the trial judge gave the jury instructions, Cleary \r\n    restated his objection that the charges did not include the medical specialty \r\n    language.Â Â Â  \r\n  The circuit court must charge the current and correct \r\n    law to the jury.Â  McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 \r\n    S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995); Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. \r\n    345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œWhen reviewing a jury charge \r\n    for alleged error, an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole \r\n    in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Welch v. Epstein, \r\n    342 S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Keaton ex \r\n    rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999)).Â  \r\n    If the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might \r\n    be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  A jury charge \r\n    is correct if it contains the correct definition and adequately charges the \r\n    law.Â  Keaton, 334 S.C. at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574.Â  The substance \r\n    of the law is what must be charged, not any particular verbiage.Â  Id. \r\n    at 496, 514 S.E.2d at 574.Â  A circuit courtâ€™s refusal to give a properly requested \r\n    charge is reversible error only where the requesting party can demonstrate \r\n    prejudice from the refusal.Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at \r\n    289.Â  \r\n  Several cases have addressed jury charges regarding \r\n    the applicable standard of care in medical malpractice cases.Â  In Cox v. \r\n    Lund, 286 S.C. 410, 334 S.E.2d 116 (1985), our state supreme court reviewed \r\n    whether the standard of care charge given by the circuit court met the requirements \r\n    of medical malpractice cases.Â  The two prong test requires that the plaintiff:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Present evidence of the generally recognized practices \r\n    and procedures which would be exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant \r\n    doctorâ€™s field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances, AND\r\n\r\n  (2) Present evidence that the defendant doctor departed \r\n    from the recognized and generally accepted standards, practices and procedures \r\n    in the manner alleged by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cox, 286 S.C. at 414, 334 S.E.2d at 118.Â  The \r\n    circuit court charged the jury that they could only find the physician guilty \r\n    of malpractice if they found he &quot;did not possess the degree of skill \r\n    common to other doctors, or that he failed or was negligent in so exercising \r\n    such skills in the treatment of a patient.â€Â  Cox, 286 S.C. at 415, \r\n    334 S.E.2d at 119.Â  The court further instructed the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a case of this nature negligence is the failure to \r\n    do that which an ordinary, careful and prudent physician or surgeon would \r\n    do under the circumstances shown by the evidence to have existed at the time \r\n    of the transaction in question, or, it is the doing of that which an ordinary, \r\n    careful and prudent physician or surgeon would not have done under the same \r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 415-16, 334 S.E.2d at 119.Â  Reviewing \r\n    these charges, our state supreme court found that the circuit court did not \r\n    err because the charges â€œfully and correctly instructed the law of medical \r\n    malpractice on burden of proof and on all other matters.â€Â  Id.\r\n  In Durr v. McElrath, 299 S.C. 30, 382 S.E.2d \r\n    20 (Ct. App. 1989), this Court addressed the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to give \r\n    requested charges that the standard of care for physicians is that â€œemployed \r\n    by the profession generally.â€Â  Finding that the circuit court correctly \r\n    refused to give the requested charge, we noted that the degree of skill and \r\n    care a physician must use in diagnosing a condition is that â€œwhich would be \r\n    exercised by competent practitioners in [the] defendant doctorâ€™s field of \r\n    medicine and not that which would be exercised by the profession generally.â€Â  \r\n    Durr, 299 S.C. at 32, 382 S.E.2d at 22.Â  However, we went on to state \r\n    that the applicable standard of care is determined by â€œwhat an ordinary, careful, \r\n    and prudentÂ  physician would have done under the same or similar circumstances.â€Â  \r\n    Id. at 33, 382 S.E.2d at 22.Â  \r\n  Our appellate courts that have more recently addressed \r\n    the appropriate charge on the standard of care have upheld charges where the \r\n    jury was asked to consider whether the physician exercised the degree of care \r\n    and skill ordinarily required by the profession â€œunder similar conditions \r\n    and in like circumstances.â€Â  Keaton, 334 S.C. at 496, 514 S.E.2d at \r\n    574 (reviewing propriety of â€œhindsightâ€ charge); cf. Burroughs v. \r\n    Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 403, 574 S.E.2d 215, 225 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding \r\n    there was no prejudicial error where clarifying charge failed to state that \r\n    the standard of care was that of physicians in the same field of medicine \r\n    because prior charges addressed the â€œsame field of medicineâ€ language).\r\n  Dr. Cleary argues he was clearly prejudiced by the charge \r\n    because Daves â€œpresented no testimony specifically addressing the standard \r\n    of care owed by an emergency roomÂ  physicianâ€ and that Davesâ€™s only expert \r\n    witness, Dr. Maron, â€œacknowledged that he would not hold a doctor in the emergency \r\n    room to the same standard as a cardiologist in regard to reading EKGs, one \r\n    of the evaluation tools used in assessing whether pain is cardiac in origin.â€ \r\n    Our review of the record confirms that Cleary is mistaken as to the standard \r\n    of care claim. Dr. Maron testified that he was familiar with the standard \r\n    of care â€œfor a physician evaluating a patient with chest pain in the emergency \r\n    room setting.â€Â  He further testified that the standard of care for â€œinitial \r\n    evaluation and management of a patient in the emergency roomâ€ is the same \r\n    regardless of the specialty of the physician. The reference to the EKG reading \r\n    is taken out of context. On cross-examination, Dr. Clearyâ€™s attorney suggested \r\n    to Maron that he would not expect an emergency room doctor to â€œnotice half \r\n    a millimeter changeâ€ in an EKG reading. Maron agreed and followed up stating \r\n    that was something a cardiologist would be expected to recognize, but not \r\n    an emergency room doctor. This statement in no way conflicts with his earlier \r\n    testimony regarding the standard of care required of Dr. Cleary.\r\n  The charge given by the circuit court in the present \r\n    case conveyed to the jurors that they must compare Clearyâ€™s actions to that \r\n    of a prudent physician similarly situated under the same or similar circumstances.Â  \r\n    Admittedly, the charge could have been fuller [2]  and specified that the jury should \r\n    compare Clearyâ€™s actions to the standard of a physician in his same field \r\n    of medicine. Nevertheless, when reviewing the charge as a whole, we find it \r\n    correctly states the law and was generally free from error.Â  Accordingly, \r\n    we find no reversible error in the charge.Â  \r\n  II. EXPERT TESTIMONY\r\n  Dr. Cleary next argues the circuit court erred in allowing \r\n    Dr. Maron, a cardiologist, to testify regarding the standard of care for an \r\n    emergency room physician.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Cleary moved in limine to have Dr. Maronâ€™s \r\n    testimony regarding the standard of care excluded.Â  Â This motion was \r\n    denied by the circuit court, and Daves called Dr. Maron to testify at trial.Â  \r\n    Dr. Maron testified that during his medical training, he had an internship \r\n    and two years residency in internal medicine, spent two years doing research \r\n    focused on heart disease, spent a few years at Stanford University teaching \r\n    internal medicine, and spent the next few years training in cardiology.Â  Â Â Although \r\n    not board certified in emergency room medicine, Dr. Maron is board certified \r\n    in internal medicine and cardiology.Â  Â Â Â He is an assistant professor \r\n    at Vanderbilt Universityâ€™s medical school, where he teaches and oversees some \r\n    medical students who are in the emergency medicine rotation. He periodically \r\n    sees patients himself in the emergency room.Â Â Â  Dr. Maron testified that he \r\n    was familiar with the standard of care for a physician evaluating a patient \r\n    in the emergency room complaining of chest pains, and that the standard is \r\n    the same, regardless of the specialty of the physician.Â Â Â  \r\n  The qualification of an expert and the admissibility \r\n    of an expertâ€™s testimony are matters within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  \r\n    Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 285, 457 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1995).Â  To be \r\n    considered competent to testify as an expert, â€œa witness must have acquired \r\n    by reason of study or experience or both such knowledge and skill in a profession \r\n    or science that he is better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on \r\n    the particular subject of his testimony.â€Â  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier \r\n    Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997).Â  â€œA medical practitionerâ€™s \r\n    experience teaching and interacting with persons in the applicable specialty \r\n    are sufficient to support his qualification as an expert.â€Â  Id. at \r\n    253, 487 S.E.2d at 598.Â  â€œA physician is not incompetent to testify merely \r\n    because he is not a specialist in the particular branch of his profession \r\n    involved.â€Â  Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 345, 426 S.E.2d \r\n    785, 786 (1993).Â  Once an expert is qualified, the adequacy of his knowledge \r\n    goes to the weight of his testimony, not the admissibility.Â  Id.\r\n  After hearing testimony regarding Dr. Maronâ€™s training, \r\n    teaching credentials, and experiences within the emergency room, the circuit \r\n    court found that he was qualified to give an expert opinion as to the standard \r\n    of care for emergency room physicians when a patient presents with a complaint \r\n    of chest pains.Â  Despite the fact that Dr. Maron is a cardiologist and is \r\n    not board certified in the field of emergency medicine, we find there was \r\n    ample evidence to support the circuit court judgeâ€™s decision to admit his \r\n    testimony as an expert.Â  Dr. Maronâ€™s lack of emergency room expertise went \r\n    to the weight of his testimony, not to its admissibility.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n    find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  III. DIRECTED VERDICT/JNOV\r\n  Dr. Cleary argues the circuit court erred in failing \r\n    to grant his motions for directed verdict and a new trial because Daves did \r\n    not present proper evidence regarding the standard of care and damages proximately \r\n    caused by Dr. Cleary.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Dr. Maron testified that Daves suffered permanent, irreversible \r\n    damage to his heart due to the heart attack, and that the damage could have \r\n    been substantially limited had he received the appropriate treatment when \r\n    he first appeared in the emergency room complaining of chest pains.Â Â  Dr. \r\n    Maron opined that had Daves been given timely intervention to restore blood \r\n    flow through the blocked artery, â€œthe vast majority of the time those procedures \r\n    are successful in restoring blood flow and stopping the heart attack.â€Â  Â Dr. \r\n    Maron acknowledged that his testimony did not mean that Daves would have suffered \r\n    no damage had he had timely intervention, and Maron did not want to speculate \r\n    on the percentage of difference in damage.Â Â Â  He also testified to a reasonable \r\n    degree of medical certainty that if Daves had received appropriate treatment \r\n    at the time he first complained of chest pains, Daves would not have developed \r\n    congestive heart failure.Â  \r\n  At the end of the presentation of evidence, Cleary moved \r\n    for a directed verdict, arguing that Daves failed to establish the standard \r\n    of care for emergency room physicians and the causal link between Davesâ€™s \r\n    injuries and Clearyâ€™s actions.Â Â  The circuit court denied the motion.Â  After \r\n    the jury rendered its verdict, Cleary moved for judgment as a matter of law, \r\n    arguing Daves failed to establish the standard of care for emergency room \r\n    physicians and that there was no causal link between Clearyâ€™s actions and \r\n    Davesâ€™s damages.Â Â Â  The court denied that motion also.Â  \r\n  In reviewing the denial of motions for directed verdict \r\n    and JNOV, the evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom \r\n    must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Brady \r\n    Dev. Co. v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 78, 439 S.E.2d 266, \r\n    269 (1993); Â Evans v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 99, 522 \r\n    S.E.2d 350, 352 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The motion should not be granted where the \r\n    â€œevidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Evans, \r\n    337 S.C. at 99, 522 S.E.2d at 352.Â  When considering the motion, neither the \r\n    appellate court nor the circuit court has authority to â€œdecide credibility \r\n    issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.â€Â  Reiland \r\n    v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 634, 500 S.E.2d 145, 154 \r\n    (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  In medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff must show \r\n    through expert testimony that, â€œin their professional opinion, the injuries \r\n    complained of most probably resulted from the defendantâ€™s negligence . . . \r\n    [and] when it is the only evidence of proximate cause relied upon, it must \r\n    provide a significant causal link between the alleged negligence and the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n    injuries, rather than a tenuous and hypothetical connection.â€Â  James v. \r\n    Lister, 331 S.C. 277, 286, 500 S.E.2d 198, 203 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  As previously discussed, the circuit court found Dr. \r\n    Maron was qualified as an expert to testify regarding the standard of care \r\n    for an emergency room physician.Â  Based on Dr. Maronâ€™s training and experience, \r\n    we agree with the circuit court.Â  Because Daves presented Dr. Maronâ€™s testimony \r\n    regarding the standard in this case, we find no error with the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n    denial of Clearyâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV based on lack of \r\n    expert testimony.Â  \r\n  As to the causation argument, Daves presented expert \r\n    testimony that he suffered irreparable heart damage leading to congestive \r\n    heart failure which could have been prevented had he received timely and appropriate \r\n    treatment.Â  The circuit court found this evidence sufficient to overcome directed \r\n    verdict and JNOV motions as to causation.Â  Evidence existed to support the \r\n    circuit courtâ€™s determination, and we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  IV. INCONSISTENT VERDICTS\r\nDr. Cleary argues the circuit court erred in failing \r\n  to grant his motion for a new trial based on the inconsistency of the verdicts.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  Jane Daves testified at trial that after her husbandâ€™s \r\n    heart attack, he was unable to perform many of the activities he used to be \r\n    able to perform, to include cutting the grass, raking leaves, tending the \r\n    garden, washing their cars and taking trips together. She further testified \r\n    that many of these tasks now fall on her to perform. She also testified that \r\n    her relationship with Daves changed drastically, and that they no longer had \r\n    a close, intimate relationship because Daves was afraid of having another \r\n    heart attack.Â Â  \r\n  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Daves for $500,000 \r\n    in actual damages.Â  The jury also initially returned a verdict in favor of \r\n    Jane Daves on the loss of consortium claim, but awarded damages of zero dollars.Â  \r\n    The circuit courtÂ  declined to accept the verdict on the loss of consortium \r\n    claim, informing the jury that it was an unacceptable verdict.Â  The judge \r\n    requested the jury clarify whether they intended a verdict for Cleary by giving \r\n    a zero damages amount or to award some monetary amount to Jane Daves if they \r\n    intended a verdict in her favor.Â  After further deliberations, the jury returned \r\n    a verdict in favor of Cleary. Dr. Cleary moved for a new trial based on the \r\n    inconsistency between the verdict for Daves and the verdict against his wife \r\n    Jane.Â Â  The circuit court denied the motion.Â  \r\n  Whether to grant a new trial is a matter within the \r\n    discretion of the trial judge, and this decision will not be disturbed on \r\n    appeal unless it is unsupported by the evidence orÂ  is controlled by an error \r\n    of law.Â  Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 446, 520 S.E.2d 625, 628-29 \r\n    (Ct. App. 1999). Verdicts which are irreconcilably inconsistent should not \r\n    stand, and a new trial should be granted, because the parties and the judge \r\n    â€œshould not be required to guess as to what the jury sought to render.â€Â  Prego \r\n    v. Hobart, 287 S.C. 116, 118, 336 S.E.2d 725, 726 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  However, \r\n    it is the duty of the court to sustain verdicts when a logical reason for \r\n    reconciling them can be found. Rhodes v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., \r\n    249 S.C. 526, 530, 155 S.E. 2d 308, 310 (1967). Nevertheless,Â  it is well \r\n    settled in South Carolina that claims for personal injuries and for loss of \r\n    consortium are separate and distinct.Â  Graham v. Whitaker,Â  282 S.C. \r\n    393, 397, 321 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1984).Â  Thus, a judgment for the defendant in \r\n    one action does not automatically bar recovery in the other action.Â  Id.;Â  \r\n    Priester v. Southern Ry. Co., 151 S.C. 433, 149 S.E. 226 (1929);Â  Ryder \r\n    v. Jefferson Hotel Co., 121 S.C. 72, 113 S.E. 474 (1922));Â  see \r\n    also Burroughs, 352 S.C. at 405, 574 S.E.2d at 227 (claims for \r\n    personal injury and loss of consortium are separate and distinct, not derivative \r\n    of each other, and each litigant is entitled to a verdict based on the law \r\n    and the evidence).Â  â€œAlthough loss of consortium is an independent action, \r\n    case law has held the right of action does not accrue until the loss of the \r\n    services, society and companionship of the spouse has actually occurred, which \r\n    has been defined as the point when the spouse sustained the injuries.â€ Stewart \r\n    v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 341 S.C. 143, 156, 533 S.E.2d 597, 604 \r\n    (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n  The case of Craven v. Cunningham , 292 S.C. 441, \r\n    357 S.E.2d 23 (1987) presents facts similar to the instant case. Mr. Craven \r\n    was injured in an automobile accident caused by Cunningham. Mr. Craven sued \r\n    to recover for his personal injuries while Mrs. Craven sued to recover for \r\n    loss of consortium â€œbasedÂ  on Mr. Cravenâ€™s inability to perform certain household \r\n    chores, and for assistance she provided in carrying her husband to the chiropractic \r\n    sessions.â€ The jury awarded Mr. Craven $6,100 actual damages, but â€œdenied \r\n    Mrs. Craven damages in her suit.â€ On appeal the supreme court held that the \r\n    â€œextent of Mr. Cravenâ€™s accident-related injuries and post-accident deterioration \r\n    of the marriage relationship were contested throughout the trial.â€ Thus, the \r\n    court concluded it was not inconsistent for the jury to award damages to Mr. \r\n    Craven but not to Mrs. Craven.Â  Id. at 442-43, 357 S.E.2d at 24-25.Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n  In the case of Haskins v. Fairfield Electric Cooperative, \r\n    283 S.C. 229, 321 S.E. 2d 185 (Ct. App. 1984), overruled on other grounds \r\n    by Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993), the jury \r\n    awarded the husband $30,000 for injuries he sustained in an electrical burn \r\n    accident, but found the wife â€œwas due no moneyâ€ on her loss of consortium \r\n    claim. This court reversed the circuit courtâ€™s denial of the wifeâ€™s motion \r\n    for a new trial on damages only, holding â€œ[i]n Mrs. Haskinsâ€™ lawsuit, the \r\n    jury did not find for [the cooperative] , and against Mrs. Haskins; rather, \r\n    the jury merely found she was due no money. By not specifically finding against \r\n    the cooperative, it is apparent the jury found for Mrs. Haskins on the issue \r\n    of liability but awarded no damages.â€ This court further held that inasmuch \r\n    as both lawsuits arose out of the same factual situation â€œand the record supports \r\n    the claim the wife had suffered damages, it is error for the trial judge to \r\n    refuse to grant a new trial [to the wife] on the issue of the wifeâ€™s damages.â€ \r\n    Id. at 237, 321 S.E.2d at 190-91.\r\n  Also instructive is the case of Guinn v. Millard \r\n    Truck Lines, Inc., 134 N.W.2d 549, 555-558 (Iowa 1965). There the wife \r\n    and the minor child were involved in an automobile accident.Â  The wife, minor \r\n    child and husband each brought a claim against the truck company and driver.Â Â  \r\n    The wife and minor child sought damages for personal injuries, the husband \r\n    sued for property damages and medical expenses.Â  The jury returned a verdict \r\n    in favor of the wife and minor child on their claims, and against the husband \r\n    on his claim.Â  The trucking company and driver appealed arguing the verdicts \r\n    were inconsistent and therefore the verdict in favor of the wife should be \r\n    reversed.Â  The Iowa supreme court held that the verdicts in this case were \r\n    not irreconcilable.Â Â  The court found that the primary issues in this case \r\n    were the negligence of the truck driver, and the contributory negligence of \r\n    the wife.Â  The court found that the juryâ€™s verdict for the wife indicted that \r\n    the jury determined that the truck driver and company were negligent.Â Â  The \r\n    court determined that the denial of recovery to the husband was based on his \r\n    damage claim, and not on the liability issue.Â  The court found that the jury \r\n    had settled the question of liability fairly and upon sufficient evidence, \r\n    and therefore, the obvious error in the case was the failure of the jury to \r\n    award the husband damages. The court rationalized: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]hat the issue of the [husbandâ€™s] damages was so disassociated \r\n    from other questions that in the interest of justice [the juryâ€™s] determination \r\n    of the [wifeâ€™s and daughterâ€™s] causes should stand.Â  [T]o decide that the \r\n    jury was not aware the issues because it refused to grant [husbandâ€™s] damages \r\n    seems unjust and needless and penalizes the truly innocent parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In this case, the jury decided the question of Clearyâ€™s \r\n    liability to both Daves and Jane fairly and upon sufficient facts. The juryâ€™s \r\n    verdict for Daves clearly implies that it found Cleary negligent and there \r\n    is abundant evidence to support that finding. The error Cleary claims the \r\n    trial judge made was in not affording him a new trial on the juryâ€™s award \r\n    to Daves because a verdict for Daves is inconsistent with the juryâ€™s finding \r\n    that Cleary is not liable for Janeâ€™s loss of consortium claim. Under the facts \r\n    of this case, the jury could have found sufficient evidence to have awarded \r\n    Jane damages, if they had believed her testimony. The jury obviously rejected \r\n    her testimony, as was theur prerogative. See Craven, 292 S.C. at 443, \r\n    357 S.E.2d at 25 (â€œThe credibility of witnesses is for the triers of factâ€).Â  \r\n    Unlike the jury in the Haskins v. Fairfield Electric case, it is clear \r\n    in this matter that when the issue of Janeâ€™s entitlement to an award was resubmitted \r\n    to the jury, the jury understood that it could not find Cleary was liable \r\n    to Jane and not award Jane damages. \r\n    [3] \r\n  Therefore, we hold the verdicts in this case are not \r\n    irreconcilably inconsistent such that Cleary is entitled to a new trial.Â  \r\n    Courts must sustain verdicts when a logical reason for reconciling them can \r\n    be found.Â  Rhodes v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., supra.Â Â Â  \r\n    A juryâ€™s verdict should be affirmed if it is possible to do so and carry into \r\n    effect the juryâ€™s clear intention.Â Â Â  New York Carpet World v. Houston, \r\n    292 S.C. 101, 103, 354 S.E.2d 924, 925 (Ct. App. 1987). \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  Based on the foregoing, the rulings by the circuit court \r\n    and juryâ€™s verdicts are\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n   GOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Neither the hospital nor the primary physician is a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    We think that the better practice is to charge juries in malpractice cases \r\n    such as this, that in evaluating the conduct of a physician the jury should \r\n    compare â€œ[the physicianâ€™s actions] to those of a doctor in the same field \r\n    of medicine.â€Â  Burroughs,Â  352 S.C. at 403,Â  574 S.E. 2dÂ  at 225.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] We hasten to observe that this case should be distinguished \r\n    from the case where the jury awards loss of consortium damages to a spouse, \r\n    but denies damages to the allegedly injured party. Â Â In suchÂ  a case, a new \r\n    trial is required.Â  See 41 Am. Jur. 2d Husband and WifeÂ  Â§ 258 \r\n    (1995) citing Smith v.

Pope, of York, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER \r\n  CURIAM:Â  Carlos M. Gill appeals his convictions for distribution of crack \r\n  cocaine, distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a school, and conspiracy \r\n  to distribute crack cocaine.Â  He argues the trial court (1) lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction on two of the charges because the indictments failed to allege \r\n  that he â€œknowinglyâ€ committed the offenses and (2) erred in finding he waived \r\n  his right to have an attorney represent him at trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nUndercover police officer William Graham, accompanied by Cora Lee Neil, an acquaintance \r\n  of Gillâ€™s, made a controlled purchase of $40 worth of crack cocaine from Gill.Â  \r\n  The purchase was video and audio taped and occurred approximately 670 feet from \r\n  an elementary school.Â  Gill was not represented by counsel at trial.Â  He was \r\n  convicted as charged, sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment and a $50,000 \r\n  fine for distribution of crack cocaine; fifteen years and a $10,000 fine for \r\n  distribution within proximity of a school; and five years for conspiracy, with \r\n  all sentences to run concurrently.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\nGill argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to try him on \r\n  the charges of distribution and distribution within the proximity of a school \r\n  because the indictments failed to allege he â€œknowinglyâ€ committed the acts.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nGillâ€™s indictment for distribution of crack cocaine alleged that he â€œdid distribute, \r\n  dispense, or deliver a quantity of crack cocaine . . . or did otherwise aid, \r\n  abet, attempt, or conspire to distribute, dispense, or deliver crack cocaine, \r\n  all in violation of Section 44-53-375. . . .â€Â  Section 44-53-375 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code provides that â€œ[a] person who manufactures, distributes, dispenses, \r\n  delivers, purchases, or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to manufacture, \r\n  distribute, dispense, deliver, or purchase, or possesses with intent to distribute, \r\n  dispense, or deliver ice, crank, or crack cocaine, in violation of the provisions \r\n  of Section 44-53-370, is guilty of a felony.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) \r\n  (2002). \r\nThe indictment for distribution within proximity of a school provided that Gill \r\n  â€œdid unlawfully distribute a controlled substance, . . . to wit: crack cocaine, \r\n  within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of York One Academy, a public school \r\n  located in the city of York, South Carolina, . . . all in violation of Section \r\n  44-53-445. . . .â€Â  Section 44-53-445 of the South Carolina Code provides it \r\n  is a separate criminal offense to â€œdistribute, sell, purchase, manufacture, \r\n  or to unlawfully possess with intent to distribute, a controlled substance while \r\n  in, on, or within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of a public or private \r\n  elementary, middle, or secondary school. . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(A) \r\n  (2002).\r\nQuestions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  \r\n  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998); State \r\n  v. Williams, 346 S.C. 424, 431, 552 S.E.2d 54, 58 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  A trial \r\n  court acquires subject matter jurisdiction over a criminal matter where â€œthere \r\n  is an indictment which sufficiently states the offense, the defendant waives \r\n  presentment, or the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime charged \r\n  in the indictment.â€Â  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 579, 564 S.E.2d 103, \r\n  105 (2002); State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 639, 545 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2001); \r\n  Carter, 329 S.C. at 362, 495 S.E.2d at 777.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAn indictment \r\n  is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to \r\n  know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal \r\n  or conviction thereon.Â  The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is \r\n  not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains \r\n  the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently \r\n  apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.Â  \r\n\r\nBrowning \r\n  v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (citations omitted); \r\n  Williams, 346 S.C. at 431-32, 552 S.E.2d at 58; S.C. Code Ann Â§ 17-19-20 \r\n  (2003).\r\nThe key question in the underlying case is whether the mens rea element of the \r\n  crime of distribution of crack cocaine must be alleged in the indictment to \r\n  confer subject matter jurisdiction.Â  In State v. Ferguson, 302 S.C. 269, \r\n  395 S.E.2d 182 (1990), our supreme court considered whether a trial court erred \r\n  in charging the jury regarding the mental state necessary to be proved for conviction \r\n  of certain crimes.Â  The Ferguson court noted that the required mental \r\n  state to be proven by the State on a certain offense may include purpose or \r\n  knowledge.Â  Id. at 271, 395 S.E.2d at 183.Â  The court then noted the \r\n  legislature could make an act or omission a crime â€œregardless of fault,â€ or \r\n  could make a particular crime a strict liability crime.Â  Id. at 271-72, \r\n  395 S.E.2d at 183.Â  Reviewing the trial courtâ€™s jury instructions regarding \r\n  the mental element of distribution of cocaine and the legislative intent behind \r\n  section 44-53-370, the court held distribution was not a strict liability crime \r\n  and the State was required to prove the defendant was at least criminally negligent.Â  \r\n  Id. at 272-73, 395 S.E.2d at 184.Â  \r\nTwo recent \r\n  cases have also discussed the elements of distribution of crack cocaine.Â  In \r\n  State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 467 S.E.2d 272 (Ct. App. 1996), this court \r\n  reviewed whether a variance in the proof and the allegations in an indictment \r\n  for distribution of crack cocaine warranted a directed verdict in favor of the \r\n  defendant.Â  We noted as follows:\r\n\r\nThe essential elements \r\n  of the offense of distribution of crack cocaine which the court charged the \r\n  jury the State was required to prove were: (1) Watts had actual control, or \r\n  the right to exercise control over the crack cocaine; (2) he knowingly distributed \r\n  or delivered the crack cocaine; (3) the substance upon analysis was, in fact, \r\n  crack cocaine; and (4) the offense occurred in Greenwood County.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (Supp. 1994).Â  The charge of distribution of crack \r\n  cocaine within one-half mile of a school required the same proof with an additional \r\n  element that the distribution occurred within a one-half mile radius of the \r\n  grounds of an elementary, middle, or secondary school.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (Supp. 1994). \r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 168, 467 S.E.2d at 278.Â  Because the indictment in Watts listed the \r\n  wrong accomplice, but the State submitted proof regarding the correct accomplice \r\n  and all elements of the crime, we held there was no material variance, the listed \r\n  co-defendant was mere surplusage, and the defendant was not entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict.Â  Id. \r\nMore recently in Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001), \r\n  our state supreme court addressed whether the trial court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over a charge of distribution within proximity of a school where \r\n  the indictment alleged the distribution occurred near a daycare center.Â  The \r\n  court noted:\r\n\r\nTo prove distribution \r\n  of crack cocaine under [S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (Supp. 1992)], the State \r\n  must establish the following elements:Â  (1) the defendant had actual control, \r\n  or the right to exercise control over the crack cocaine; (2) he knowingly distributed \r\n  or delivered the crack cocaine; (3) the substance upon analysis was, in fact, \r\n  crack cocaine; and (4) the distribution occurred within a one-half mile radius \r\n  of the grounds of an elementary, middle, secondary or vocational school; public \r\n  playground or park; or college or university.Â  See id.; State \r\n  v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 168, 467 S.E.2d 272, 278 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 347-48, 540 S.E.2d at 849.Â  Because daycare centers were not listed in the \r\n  statute by the legislature, our supreme court held the indictment failed to \r\n  include a necessary element of the offense and the trial court did not have \r\n  jurisdiction over the matter.Â  Id. at 349-50, 540 S.E.2d at 850.Â  \r\nIn the underlying case, Gillâ€™s indictment for distribution alleged that on February \r\n  1, 2000, he distributed crack cocaine or aided, abetted, attempted or conspired \r\n  to distribute crack cocaine in violation of Section 44-53-375.Â  His indictment \r\n  for the proximity charge alleged Gill distributed crack cocaine within a one-half \r\n  mile radius of York One Academy, a South Carolina public school, in violation \r\n  of Section 44-53-445 on the same date.Â  Both indictments listed the elements \r\n  of the crime found in the respective statutes.Â  The indictments sufficiently \r\n  informed Gill he had to defend against charges of distribution of crack cocaine \r\n  and distribution near York One Academy on February 1, 2000.Â  Clearly, the indictments \r\n  were sufficient to inform Gill about the charges he faced and what he must defend \r\n  against.Â  \r\nWith regard to Gillâ€™s allegations that the indictments must allege that he â€œknowinglyâ€ \r\n  distributed the drugs, we note neither Section 44-53-375 nor Section 44-53-445 \r\n  includes â€œknowinglyâ€ as an element of the crime.Â  Although Ferguson, \r\n  Watts, and Brown list â€œknowinglyâ€ as an element the State must \r\n  prove for the crime of distribution, none of these cases addressed whether the \r\n  â€œknowinglyâ€ element must be alleged in the indictment in order to convey subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  Upon closer scrutiny, we find they can be read to mean \r\n  that â€œknowinglyâ€ is merely an element the State must prove to obtain a conviction.Â  \r\n  If the General Assembly intended a mens rea element in the crimes of distribution \r\n  and distribution within proximity of a school to be necessary to convey jurisdiction, \r\n  the requirement would have been listed in the statute.Â  Accordingly, reading \r\n  the indictments and statutes as a whole, we find the indictments contained the \r\n  elements necessary to convey jurisdiction, and Gill was sufficiently apprised \r\n  of the crimes against him.Â  \r\nII. WAIVER OF ATTORNEY\r\nGill argues the trial court erred in finding he waived his right to an attorney \r\n  and in failing to inquire whether he qualified for a public defender.Â  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nGill applied for appointment of a public defender on April 17, 2000, while he \r\n  was free on bond for the underlying charges.Â  Because Gill was gainfully employed \r\n  at the time, he was rejected as non-indigent.Â  Gill repeatedly assured the assistant \r\n  solicitor that he intended to hire a private attorney, but failed to do so.Â  \r\n  Gill also failed to appear for a court date and was incarcerated pursuant to \r\n  a bench warrant on July 26, 2000.Â  \r\nOn August 11, 2000, a hearing was held before the trial court concerning Gillâ€™s \r\n  lack of representation.Â  The assistant solicitor stated she wanted an attorney \r\n  on the other side of the case and informed the court that she had encouraged \r\n  Gill to fill out another application for a public defender.Â  The trial judge \r\n  informed Gill that his trial date was August 21, 2000, and inquired whether \r\n  Gill would like to apply for a public defender.Â  The following exchange then \r\n  occurred:\r\n\r\nMr. Gill:Â  My girlfriend, \r\n  I had a visit yesterday.Â  Hopefully, everything going all right.Â  She was supposed \r\n  to meet with him today.Â  I told [Assistant Solicitor] I would get back with \r\n  her sometime and let her know.Â  I supposed to be getting Stacy Lewis, so when \r\n  I call her today, Iâ€™ll know something for sure.Â  \r\nThe Court:Â  All \r\n  right. Youâ€™re up for trial with or without an attorney the week of the twenty-first \r\n  of this month.Â  Weâ€™re not going to put off the trial for you to get a lawyer.Â  \r\n  Youâ€™ve either got to get one or â€“ you havenâ€™t applied for a public defender, \r\n  so, we canâ€™t appoint you one.Â  But we canâ€™t keep rocking along without a trial \r\n  being disposed of.Â  Do you understand that?\r\nMr. Gill:Â  \r\n  Yes sir.Â  \r\nThe Court:Â  \r\n  Do you have any questions? \r\nMr. Gill:Â  No sir.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBecause the State was trying other cases, Gillâ€™s case was not called the week \r\n  of August 21, 2000.Â  Gill requested a hearing before the trial judge on August \r\n  24, 2000, to discuss whether the bench warrant against him should have been \r\n  issued.Â  During the hearing, the assistant solicitor expressed her concern that \r\n  Gill still did not have representation.Â  Gill told the trial judge he had $800 \r\n  of the $1,000 needed to retain Stacy Lewis as an attorney, but he could not \r\n  earn the remaining money if the trial judge did not allow him out on bond so \r\n  he could return to work.Â  The trial court refused to withdraw the bench warrant \r\n  and free Gill.Â  \r\nGillâ€™s trial began September 12, 2000.Â  Before the trial began, Gill informed \r\n  the trial judge that the assistant solicitor prevented him from getting an attorney, \r\n  even though Gillâ€™s family had the money to pay Lewis.Â  The trial judge called \r\n  attorney Lewis on the speaker telephone to determine whether Gill had actually \r\n  retained his services.Â  Lewis denied that he represented Gill.Â  He explained \r\n  that Gillâ€™s girlfriend was supposed to bring a retainer fee by 3:00 the previous \r\n  afternoon, but she failed to do so until after 3:30, when Lewis had left the \r\n  office.Â  Lewis stated he had â€œhad it with them,â€ and admitted the assistant \r\n  solicitor informed him the trial judge would not likely grant a continuance \r\n  in the case because Gill had been informed to be prepared for trial with or \r\n  without an attorney.Â  Noting that Gill had â€œplenty of timeâ€ in which to retain \r\n  counsel, the trial judge informed Gill that his trial would proceed without \r\n  an attorney, finding as follows:\r\n\r\nI find that the \r\n  Court and the solicitorâ€™s office both ha[ve] done all possible to assist and \r\n  urge Mr. Gill to obtain counsel and he has not so done.Â  I find no showing why \r\n  he has not retained counsel other than he just hadnâ€™t chose[n] to pay him according \r\n  to what Mr. Lewisâ€™ comments were, so I find that he has waived his right to \r\n  counsel and he is to proceed to trial without an attorney.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring \r\n  the trial, the court further noted that:\r\n\r\nThe court has after \r\n  due deliberation prior to commencing the trial made a conscious decision not \r\n  to appoint the public defender or anyone else to assist Mr. Gill as is sometimes \r\n  done in cases of this type.Â  The court did not want to put counsel in that position \r\n  and the court finds there is no way any counsel could be prepared to do, to \r\n  appoint counsel under these circumstances is somewhat inconsistent with finding \r\n  that Mr. Gill has waived his right to counsel.Â  \r\n\r\nGill complained \r\n  that he was being denied his rights, that he needed an attorney, and that his \r\n  family had the money to hire one for him.Â  \r\nThe court \r\n  proceeded with the trial.Â  Gill continued to protest his lack of representation \r\n  and refused to participate in jury selection or opening statements.Â  After Gill \r\n  questioned the judge regarding his rights, the judge informed the jury that \r\n  Gill was given the right to get an attorney.Â  Gill continued to object that \r\n  his rights had been violated and he had not been given an attorney throughout \r\n  the trial.Â  At one point, Gill interrupted Neilâ€™s testimony to state that she \r\n  smokes crack.Â  He then complained the court was â€œrailroadingâ€ him because the \r\n  court failed to appoint a public defender to defend him, and he requested to \r\n  be taken out of the courtroom into the holding cell.Â  The judge allowed Gill \r\n  to be taken to the holding cell, and he admonished the jury not to consider \r\n  his absence against him in any manner.Â  The trial continued with the State calling \r\n  three more witnesses while Gill was in the holding cell.Â  After the State rested, \r\n  Gill was brought back into the courtroom and chose not to present any evidence.Â  \r\n  During his closing argument, Gill continued to complain that the court had â€œtakenâ€ \r\n  all his rights away by preventing him from getting an attorney, despite the \r\n  fact that his family had the money to hire one.Â  \r\nThe Sixth \r\n  Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right to counsel.Â  U.S. Const. amend. \r\n  VI.; Stevenson v. State, 337 S.C. 23, 26, 522 S.E.2d 343, 344 (1999).Â  \r\n  This right may be waived.Â  State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 241, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  168, 170 (1999).Â  A waiver may be inferred from the defendantâ€™s actions.Â  State \r\n  v. Cain, 277 S.C. 210, 210-11, 284 S.E.2d 779 (1981).Â  \r\nIn State \r\n  v. Jacobs, our supreme court considered whether a criminal defendant waived \r\n  his right to counsel through his conduct rather than by express waiver.Â  Jacobs, \r\n  271 S.C. 126, 245 S.E.2d 606 (1978).Â  In that case, Ray Jacobs surrendered himself \r\n  on May 23, 1977, pursuant to an arrest warrant for possession and sale of marijuana.Â  \r\n  The trial court found him non-indigent and advised him to hire an attorney.Â  \r\n  On several occasions, the court urged Jacobs to retain counsel and continued \r\n  the case at least once because Jacobs had not yet done so.Â  At one point prior \r\n  to trial, Jacobs informed the court he had counsel, but the record did not reveal \r\n  the accuracy of this claim.Â  Jacobsâ€™ trial was held on June 2. Â Jacobs appeared \r\n  without counsel, but informed the court that his brother was supposed to bring \r\n  counsel and that he had been waiting on him to make the arrangements.Â  The court \r\n  offered to get the attorney into court, but Jacobs did not provide a name or \r\n  a time when he expected to have retained counsel.Â  The court then ruled Jacobs \r\n  had waived his right to counsel and asked a public defender to sit with him \r\n  to offer advice and assistance.Â  Id. at 127, 245 S.E.2d at 607.Â  On appeal, \r\n  our supreme court held Jacobs had been granted â€œa reasonable time in which to \r\n  retain counsel andÂ  . . . did not make a sufficient showing of reasons for his \r\n  failure to have counsel present.â€Â  Id. at 128, 245 S.E.2d at 608.Â  Thus, \r\n  the court reasoned, Jacobs had, â€œby his conductâ€ waived his right to counsel.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Therefore, the court refused to consider the adequacy of the assistance \r\n  provided him by the public defender who sat with him during the trial.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  \r\nIn State \r\n  v. Cain, Larry Cain was tried in absentia and without counsel for \r\n  driving under the influence, third offense.Â  Cain, 277 S.C. 210, 284 \r\n  S.E.2d 779 (1981).Â  On appeal from his conviction, Cain argued the trial court \r\n  could not infer a valid waiver of his right to counsel by his failure to appear \r\n  at trial.Â  Our supreme court disagreed, noting Cain was released on a general \r\n  appearance bond and was represented by counsel at a preliminary hearing and \r\n  that both Cain and his counsel knew about the upcoming trial, but failed to \r\n  appear.Â  Id. at 210-11, 284 S.E.2d at 779.Â  The court held Cainâ€™s waiver \r\n  of counsel was inferable by his failure to fulfill his appearance bond conditions \r\n  and his failure to keep in contact with his counsel.Â  Id. \r\nIn the present case, Gill repeatedly assured the trial judge that either he \r\n  or his family had the money to retain counsel.Â  Even when the trial judge inquired \r\n  whether he wanted to apply for a public defender, Gill continued to claim that \r\n  he intended to hire private counsel.Â  At two pre-trial hearings, the State and \r\n  the trial court discussed their concerns regarding Gillâ€™s lack of counsel.Â  \r\n  However, between Gillâ€™s April 17, 2000 arrest and his September&nbsp;2000 trial, \r\n  Gill failed to obtain counsel.Â  Although Gill never expressly waived his right \r\n  to counsel, the trial court found it did all it could to urge Gill to obtain \r\n  counsel.Â  Gill was allowed a reasonable time in which to hire counsel.Â  Based \r\n  on Gillâ€™s actions, we find a waiver of counsel may be inferred.Â  Id.; \r\n  Jacobs, 271 S.C. at 128, 245 S.E.2d at 608.Â  \r\n \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL \r\n  and HOWARD, JJ. and STROM, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3657","title":"State v.

Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Leroy Dupree was charged with trafficking in crack cocaine \r\n  in an amount of ten grams or more, but less than twenty-eight grams.Â  He waived \r\n  his right to trial by jury.Â  The circuit court judge found Dupree guilty of \r\n  trafficking in crack cocaine; concluded the conviction was a second offense \r\n  for enhancement purposes; and sentenced Dupree to fifteen years, plus a fine \r\n  of $25,000.Â  On appeal, Dupree asserts the judge erred in (1) failing to suppress \r\n  evidence seized in a search and (2) sentencing him for a second offense of trafficking, \r\n  where the enhancement was based on a prior conviction of possession with intent \r\n  to distribute rather than a prior conviction of trafficking.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 19, 2001, Deputy Trinette Mullineaux, with the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department, appeared before the magistrate and signed an affidavit to obtain \r\n  a search warrant for â€œcrack cocaine, paraphernalia, paperwork, and other items \r\n  associated with the use, storage, and distribution of crack cocaine.â€Â  In the \r\n  affidavit, Deputy Mullineaux revealed the â€œlocation to be searched is Bobby \r\n  Doveâ€™s Trailer Park off 1711 Percival, Lot #10.â€Â  The affidavit supporting the \r\n  search warrant provided:\r\n\r\nWithin the past (72) hours, a confidential and first time \r\n  informant of the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department has purchased crack cocaine \r\n  from the described location.Â  The informant was searched before and after the \r\n  purchase and was observed by narcotics agents while making the purchase entering \r\n  and exiting the location.Â  Based on the affiantâ€™s and other Richland County \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Departments [sic] narcotic agents experience in drug enforcement, \r\n  it is known that subjects present at the scene of illegal drug distribution \r\n  and/or possession commonly have drugs in their possession and also store and \r\n  or transport in vehicles in their possession.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate issued the search warrant.Â  Officers with the Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  executed the search warrant on January 25, 2001.Â  Sergeant Jerry Maldonado kicked \r\n  the door down because it was locked.Â  He entered the mobile home before any \r\n  other officer.Â  Immediately, Sergeant Maldonado noticed Dupree in the living \r\n  room â€œby the couch on the left-hand side.â€Â  The police discovered â€œsome crack \r\n  cocaine that was on [Dupreeâ€™s] person.â€Â  In addition to the crack cocaine, the \r\n  officers seized over $800 in cash, a gun, and some marijuana.\r\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved to suppress the crack cocaine seized \r\n  pursuant to the search warrant arguing that the warrant was not supported by \r\n  probable cause.Â  Counsel claimed there was â€œno indicia of reliability alleged \r\n  in the search warrant as to [the first-time] informantâ€™s veracity or reliabilityâ€ \r\n  and â€œno corroborative investigation alleged on the face of the warrant.â€\r\nAt the hearing on the motion to suppress, Deputy Mullineaux testified \r\n  regarding the information she presented to the magistrate on January 19, 2001.Â  \r\n  Deputy Mullineaux stated that she advised the magistrate she â€œhad received several \r\n  . . . different information sources that this particular residence was dealing \r\n  narcotics.â€Â  Deputy Mullineaux declared:\r\n\r\nWhat I also presented to [the magistrate] was after Iâ€™d \r\n  received this information, I went with a confidential informant to this residence.Â  \r\n  Droveâ€”had another agent stand by and I went with the confidential informant \r\n  to the vehicleâ€”to the residence, observed the confidential informant get out \r\n  of the vehicle and go to the back of his door, which he had purchased crack \r\n  and turned that crack back over to me once he came back to the vehicle; that \r\n  was the controlled buy that we had made to obtain this search warrant.\r\n\r\nDeputy Mullineaux chose the particular confidential informant because he was \r\n  well known to Dupree and â€œwas able to purchase crack at this particular residence.â€Â  \r\n  The confidential informant accompanied Deputy Mullineaux to the location where \r\n  the controlled buy occurred.Â  The confidential informant was searched before \r\n  he purchased the crack cocaine. At this time, the confidential informant had \r\n  no drugs on his person.Â  The officer watched the confidential informant get \r\n  out of the vehicle and walk to the back door of the mobile home.Â  When the confidential \r\n  informant returned from the residence, he had crack cocaine in his possession \r\n  and turned it over to Deputy Mullineaux.\r\nOn cross-examination of Deputy Mullineaux, the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\nQ:Â  When you had prepared [the search warrant], did the \r\n  magistrate ask you for sworn oral testimony or did you elicit that on your own?\r\nA:Â  Yes, sir, he asked me to stipulate how the buy had occurred \r\n  and what information I had on this particular case. . . . I informed him about \r\n  the control[led] buy that we made there and about the information that I had \r\n  received, which is why I even attempted a controlled buy at this particular \r\n  location.\r\n\r\nDeputy Mullineaux said that she gave the same information to the magistrate \r\n  that she testified to at the hearing.Â  The judge denied Dupreeâ€™s motion to suppress \r\n  the crack cocaine, finding there was probable cause for the magistrate to issue \r\n  the warrant.\r\nDuring the trial, when the Solicitor moved to admit the crack cocaine into \r\n  evidence, defense counsel made a timely objection based on the same grounds \r\n  asserted at the prior hearing on the motion to suppress.Â  The objection was \r\n  overruled.\r\nThe judge found Dupree guilty as charged.Â  Dupree was sentenced to \r\n  fifteen years, plus a fine of $25,000.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the trial court err in denying Dupreeâ€™s motion to \r\n  suppress the crack cocaine seized in the search of the mobile home?\r\nII.Â  Did the trial court err in sentencing Dupree for a \r\n  second offense of trafficking where the enhancement was based on a prior conviction \r\n  of possession with intent to distribute rather than a prior conviction of trafficking?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviewing the decision to issue a search warrant should \r\n  decide whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable \r\n  cause existed.Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002); State v. Arnold, 319 S.C. 256, 460 S.E.2d 403 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n  This review, like the determination by the magistrate, is governed by the â€œtotality \r\n  of the circumstancesâ€ test.Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  675 (2000); King, 349 S.C. at 148, 561 S.E.2d at 643.Â  The appellate \r\n  court should give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable \r\n  cause.Â  Jones, 342 S.C. at 126, 536 S.E.2d at 678; State v. Dunbar, \r\n  Op. No. 3631 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 21, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 15 \r\n  at 44) (Anderson, J., dissenting); King, 349 S.C. at 148, 561 S.E.2d \r\n  at 643.\r\nAffidavits are not meticulously drawn by lawyers, but are normally drafted \r\n  by non-lawyers in the haste of a criminal investigation, and should therefore \r\n  be viewed in a common sense and realistic fashion.Â  State v. Sullivan, \r\n  267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976); Arnold, 319 S.C. at 260, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  at 405.Â  Our task is to decide whether the magistrate had a substantial basis \r\n  for concluding probable cause existed.Â  State v. Adolphe, 314 S.C. 89, \r\n  441 S.E.2d 832 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The term â€œprobable causeâ€ does not import absolute \r\n  certainty.Â  State v. Bennett, 256 S.C. 234, 182 S.E.2d 291 (1971); Arnold, \r\n  319 S.C. at 260, 460 S.E.2d at 405.Â  Rather, in determining whether a search \r\n  warrant should be issued, magistrates are concerned with probabilities and not \r\n  certainties.Â  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at 617, 230 S.E.2d at 624.Â  Searches \r\n  based on warrants will be given judicial deference to the extent that an otherwise \r\n  marginal search may be justified if it meets a realistic standard of probable \r\n  cause.Â  Bennett, 256 S.C. at 241, 182 S.E.2d at 294; Arnold, 319 \r\n  S.C. at 260, 460 S.E.2d at 405.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  VALIDITY OF SEARCH \r\n  WARRANT\r\nDupree contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress \r\n  evidence obtained as a result of the search of the mobile home.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Dupree maintains the search warrant affidavit and additional information provided \r\n  to the magistrate did not support a finding of probable cause because the State \r\n  failed to (1) demonstrate the reliability of the confidential informant and \r\n  (2) provide any specific factual detail concerning what had transpired or been \r\n  observed when the informant was in the residence.Â  We disagree.\r\nA magistrate may issue a search warrant only upon a finding of probable cause.Â  \r\n  State v. Tench, 353 S.C. 531, 579 S.E.2d 314 (2003); State v. Weston, \r\n  329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997); State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThe South Carolina General Assembly has enacted \r\n  a requirement that search warrants may be issued â€˜only upon affidavit sworn \r\n  to before the magistrate . . . establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€™â€Â  \r\n  State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999) (quoting \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985)).\r\nThe affidavit must contain sufficient underlying facts and information upon \r\n  which the magistrate may make a determination of probable cause.Â  State v. \r\n  Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 454 S.E.2d 905 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The magistrate should \r\n  determine probable cause based on all of the information available to the magistrate \r\n  at the time the warrant was issued.Â  State v. Driggers, 322 S.C. 506, \r\n  473 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1996); State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 457 S.E.2d \r\n  616 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In determining the validity of the warrant, a reviewing \r\n  court may consider only information brought to the magistrateâ€™s attention.Â  \r\n  State v. Owen, 275 S.C. 586, 274 S.E.2d 510 (1981); State v. Martin, \r\n  347 S.C. 522, 556 S.E.2d 706 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court, in Illinois v. Gates, 462 \r\n  U.S. 213 (1983), rejected the application of a rigid two-pronged test in which \r\n  an informantâ€™s veracity and basis of knowledge were considered as separate and \r\n  independent requirements to finding probable cause.Â  Weston, 329 S.C. \r\n  at 290, 494 S.E.2d at 802.Â  â€œInstead, the Court adopted a totality of the circumstances \r\n  test where veracity and basis of knowledge were relevant to, but not inflexible \r\n  requirements of, a determination of probable cause.â€Â  Id.Â  The magistrateâ€™s \r\n  task in determining whether to issue a search warrant is to make a practical, \r\n  common sense decision concerning whether, under the totality of the circumstances \r\n  set forth in the affidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of \r\n  persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband \r\n  or evidence of a crime will be found in the particular place to be searched.Â  \r\n  Gates, 462 U.S. at 238; Tench, 353 S.C. at Â Â Â , 579 S.E.2d \r\n  at 316; Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 143, 519 S.E.2d at 348; King, 349 \r\n  S.C. at 150, 561 S.E.2d at 644; see also State v. Jones, 342 S.C. \r\n  121, 536 S.E.2d 675 (2000) (under totality of circumstances test, reviewing \r\n  court considers all circumstances, including status, basis of knowledge, and \r\n  veracity of informant, when determining whether or not probable cause existed \r\n  to issue search warrant).Â  Under this formula, veracity and basis of knowledge \r\n  are treated â€œas closely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the \r\n  commonsense, practical question whether there is â€˜probable causeâ€™ to believe \r\n  that contraband or evidence is located in a particular place.â€Â  Gates, \r\n  462 U.S. at 230.Â  These are relevant considerations in the totality of the circumstances \r\n  analysis.Â  Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 144, 519 S.E.2d at 349.\r\nA deficiency in one of the elements of veracity and reliability may be compensated \r\n  for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as \r\n  to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.Â  Gates, 462 U.S. \r\n  at 233; Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 144, 519 S.E.2d at 349; Martin, 347 \r\n  S.C. at 527-28, 556 S.E.2d at 709.Â  The Gates case enunciated the following \r\n  examples of the interaction of the relevant considerations:\r\n\r\nIf, for example, a particular informant is known for the \r\n  unusual reliability of his predictions of certain types of criminal activities \r\n  in a locality, his failure, in a particular case, to thoroughly set forth the \r\n  basis of his knowledge surely should not serve as an absolute bar to a finding \r\n  of probable cause based on his tip.Â  Likewise, if an unquestionably honest citizen \r\n  comes forward with a report of criminal activity--which if fabricated would \r\n  subject him to criminal liability--we have found rigorous scrutiny of the basis \r\n  of his knowledge unnecessary.Â  Conversely, even if we entertain some doubt as \r\n  to an informantâ€™s motives, his explicit and detailed description of alleged \r\n  wrongdoing, along with a statement that the event was observed firsthand, entitles \r\n  his tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the case.\r\n\r\nGates, 462 U.S. at 233-34 (citations omitted).\r\nState v. Viard, 276 S.C. 147, 276 S.E.2d 531 (1981), although decided \r\n  under the more stringent pre-Gates standard, is instructive.Â  In Viard, \r\n  a confidential informant made a controlled buy of drugs at the residence of \r\n  the Viards.Â  Id. at 148, 276 S.E.2d at 532.Â  The residence was searched, \r\n  pursuant to a warrant, and a quantity of drugs seized.Â  Id. at 148-49, \r\n  276 S.E.2d at 532.Â  The trial judge granted the Viardsâ€™ motion to suppress the \r\n  drugs, holding the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not contain information \r\n  about the informantâ€™s reliability and failed to set forth sufficient underlying \r\n  facts to enable the magistrate to make an independent finding of probable cause.Â  \r\n  Id. at 149, 276 S.E.2d at 532.Â  The Supreme Court, applying the more \r\n  strict pre-Gates test, reversed the trial courtâ€™s grant of the Viardsâ€™ \r\n  motion to suppress the drugs.Â  The Court explained:\r\n\r\n  Although reliability may be established by the informant having previously \r\n  supplied accurate information, this is not the exclusive means by which credibility \r\n  may be shown.Â  Reliability can also be established by the independent verification \r\n  of the information, prior to the search.Â  See: State v. Camargo, \r\n  23 Ariz. App. 47, 530 P.2d 893 (1975); State v. Bullard, 267 N.C. 599, \r\n  148 S.E.2d 565 (1966).\r\nHere, the warrant must be upheld not on the basis of the past credibility of \r\n  the informant, but upon the independent verification of facts by the affiant.Â  \r\n  The information furnished by the informant taken as a whole in the light of \r\n  all of the circumstances disclosed is reliable.Â  Moreover, the controlled buy \r\n  was evidence of the credibility and trustworthiness of the informant.Â  See: \r\n  Camargo, supra; Tamburino v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 821, \r\n  241 S.E.2d 762 (1978).\r\nAlthough the affidavit was inartfully drawn, a common-sense reading of it supports \r\n  the magistrateâ€™s finding of probable cause.Â  Affiant alleged his informant had \r\n  been at the residence, saw drugs there within the past 72 hours, and purchased \r\n  drugs during a controlled buy which field tested positive for depressants.Â  \r\n  We conclude the affidavit contained sufficient underlying facts and information \r\n  upon which the magistrate made her independent determination of probable cause.\r\n\r\nViard, 276 S.C. at 150-51, 276 S.E.2d at 532.\r\nFurthermore, the case of United States v. Smith, 914 F.2d 565 (4th Cir. \r\n  1990), is illustrative.Â  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals articulated:\r\n\r\nSmith challenges the search of his motel room by asserting that there was a \r\n  lack of probable cause . . . .\r\nSmith attacks the conclusory nature of the affidavit, specifically asserting \r\n  that the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not establish probable \r\n  cause because the affiant (Lieutenant Dotson) failed to explain how the â€œreliable \r\n  confidential informantâ€ was indeed reliable or how he knew that the informant \r\n  had observed cocaine in Room 254.Â  This argument is manifestly without merit. \r\n  The affidavit clearly states that the informant was observed entering a room \r\n  with no cocaine in his possession, exiting the room, and then turning over cocaine \r\n  to Dotson.Â  Thus, it is clear that the magistrate had a â€œâ€˜substantial basis \r\n  for . . . concludingâ€™â€ that there was â€œa fair probability that contraband or \r\n  evidence of a crimeâ€ would be found in Room 254. Illinois v. Gates, 462 \r\n  U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nSmith, 914 F.2d at 568.\r\nAn informantâ€™s controlled buy of drugs can constitute probable cause sufficient \r\n  for a magistrate to issue a warrant.Â  See United States v. Clyburn, \r\n  24 F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Cook, 949 \r\n  F.2d 289 (10th Cir. 1991) (finding probable cause where informant was searched \r\n  for money and drugs, was given money and seen to enter defendantâ€™s apartment, \r\n  from which he exited and was searched again, revealing presence of crack cocaine \r\n  and absence of money); Langford v. State, 962 S.W.2d 358 (Ark. 1998) \r\n  (declaring that controlled buy established probable cause where officer searched \r\n  informants to ensure they had no drugs, watched them enter and leave the home \r\n  where they purchased the drugs, and then received drugs from informants); State \r\n  v. Sherlock, 768 P.2d 1290 (Haw. 1989) (holding affidavit was sufficient \r\n  to establish probable cause where officer searched informant before and after \r\n  controlled buy and watched him enter particular apartment); State v. Toler, \r\n  787 P.2d 711 (Kan. 1990) (ruling judge had substantial basis for concluding \r\n  probable cause existed to issue search warrant where informant was searched \r\n  before controlled buy, was kept in sight until he entered defendantâ€™s residence, \r\n  and immediately upon exit turned drugs over to police); State v. Knowlton, \r\n  489 A.2d 529 (Me. 1985) (noting that controlled buy was sufficient corroboration \r\n  under Gates even though affidavit failed to describe in explicit detail \r\n  the police surveillance of informant during controlled buy); Commonwealth \r\n  v. Warren, 635 N.E.2d 240, 242 (Mass. 1994) (stating â€œ[a] controlled purchase \r\n  of narcotics, supervised by the police, provides probable cause to issue a search \r\n  warrantâ€); Commonwealth v. Hill, 747 N.E.2d 1241, 1250 n.9 (Mass. App. \r\n  Ct. 2001) (emphasizing that a controlled buy is â€œone of the most significant \r\n  means of corroboration of an otherwise unverified tip.â€); State v. Cavegn, \r\n  356 N.W.2d 671 (Minn. 1984) (observing that controlled buy was sufficient corroboration \r\n  where informant was searched before and after going into apartment building \r\n  to buy drugs); State v. Emmi, 628 A.2d 939 (Vt. 1993) (recognizing that \r\n  police control of drug purchase provides basis for police to conclude that informant \r\n  has, in fact, obtained drugs from claimed source; fruits of controlled purchase \r\n  and supervision by police of purchase help assure that judicial officer to whom \r\n  application for warrant is made has information from which to make an independent \r\n  determination of an informantâ€™s basis of knowledge and veracity).\r\nIn Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, Wayne R. \r\n  LaFave illuminates:\r\n\r\n[A] situation in which the corroboration will suffice to show veracity is that \r\n  in which the informant has not been working independently, but rather has cooperated \r\n  closely with the police, as is true when the informant makes a controlled purchase \r\n  of narcotics.Â  That is, where there is â€œphysical proximity and active participation \r\n  in the informantâ€™s intrigueâ€ by the police, so that it is not â€œindependent police \r\n  workâ€ which corroborates, but rather â€œthe police corroboration is a co-ordinant \r\n  and intrinsic part of the informerâ€™s operation,â€ the risk of falsehood has been \r\n  sufficiently diminished.Â  As explained in State v. Barrett[, 320 A.2d \r\n  621, 625 (Vt. 1974)]:\r\n  \r\nThe purpose of the search of the informer and his being escorted to the place \r\n  of purchase was to eliminate both as much as possible of the hearsay aspects \r\n  of the search warrant request and to reduce the reliance on â€œveracityâ€ to a \r\n  minimum.Â  The magistrate had enough facts to support a finding of probable cause, \r\n  and had them in a form which rendered extended evaluation of the informantâ€™s \r\n  credibility unnecessary.\r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \r\n  Â§ 3.3(f) (3d ed. 1996) (footnotes omitted).\r\nIf the controlled buy was properly conducted, it alone can provide facts sufficient \r\n  to establish probable cause for a search warrant.Â  See Hignut v. State, \r\n  303 A.2d 173, 180 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1973) (â€œSo long as the controls are adequate, \r\n  the â€˜controlled buyâ€™ alone may well establish probable cause to search a suspect \r\n  premises . . . .â€); Sadler v. State, 905 S.W.2d 21 (Tex. App. 1995) (determining \r\n  that circumstances of controlled buy, standing alone, may be sufficient to reasonably \r\n  confirm informantâ€™s information and give probable cause to issue search warrant).Â  \r\n  The Court of Appeals of Georgia, in Davis v. State, 568 S.E.2d 161 (Ga. \r\n  Ct. App. 2002), inculcated:\r\n\r\nThe controlled buy supervised by law enforcement officers would alone have provided \r\n  probable cause.Â  â€œEven if an officer cannot provide information regarding the \r\n  veracity of an informant or the basis of his knowledge, a tip may be proved \r\n  reliable if portions of the tip are sufficiently corroborated.â€Â  Here, officers \r\n  witnessed the delivery of the cocaine and confirmed the accuracy of many of \r\n  the informantâ€™s predictions concerning Davisâ€™s behavior.Â  This â€œsufficiently \r\n  corroboratedâ€ the informantâ€™s information and showed its reliability.\r\n\r\nDavis, 568 S.E.2d at 165 (citations omitted).Â  Where the affidavit is \r\n  based in part on information provided by an informant of unknown reliability, \r\n  police corroboration of details provided in the tip may establish probable cause.Â  \r\n  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983); cf. State v. 192 Coin-Operated \r\n  Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000) (warrant based \r\n  solely on information provided by confidential informant must contain information \r\n  supporting credibility of informant and basis of his knowledge; however, independent \r\n  verification by law enforcement officers cures any defect).\r\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, we hold the affidavit provided \r\n  the magistrate with a substantial basis for finding probable cause to search \r\n  the mobile home.Â  State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997) \r\n  (duty of reviewing court is simply to ensure that magistrate had substantial \r\n  basis for concluding that probable cause existed).Â  Although the affidavit provides \r\n  the informant is a first-time informant, there are sufficient other indicators \r\n  of the reliability of his statements.Â  See Gates, 462 U.S. at \r\n  233 (deficiency in one of elements of veracity and reliability may be compensated \r\n  for, in determining overall reliability of a tip, by strong showing of basis \r\n  of knowledge or by some other indicia of reliability).Â  The information provided \r\n  by the confidential informant was corroborated by the independent police investigation.Â  \r\n  The affidavit indicated that Deputy Mullineaux had conducted an independent \r\n  investigation by setting up the controlled buy.Â  Deputy Mullineaux searched \r\n  the informant prior to the controlled buy at the mobile home.Â  At this time, \r\n  the informant had no drugs on his person.Â  The officer observed the informant \r\n  enter and exit the mobile home.Â  When the informant returned, Deputy Mullineaux \r\n  searched him again.Â  At this time, the informant was in possession of crack \r\n  cocaine and reported obtaining the crack cocaine in the mobile home for which \r\n  the warrant was obtained.Â  This amounts to sufficient police corroboration of \r\n  an informantâ€™s information based on the controlled buy.Â  See United \r\n  States v. Clyburn, 24 F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1994) (clarifying that an informantâ€™s \r\n  controlled buy of crack cocaine constituted probable cause for issuance of a \r\n  search warrant); United States v. Martin, 920 F.2d 393 (6th Cir. 1990) \r\n  (rejecting defendantâ€™s claim that the informant was unreliable on the ground \r\n  that the informantâ€™s charges had been verified through a controlled buy of cocaine).Â  \r\n  The affidavit advised that an informant had made a controlled purchase of crack \r\n  cocaine from the mobile home.Â  The affidavit clearly states the confidential \r\n  informant was observed entering the mobile home with no crack cocaine in his \r\n  possession, exiting the mobile home, and then turning over the crack cocaine \r\n  to Deputy Mullineaux.Â  The controlled buy was evidence of the credibility and \r\n  trustworthiness of the informant.Â  Furthermore, when the officers executed the \r\n  search warrant, they did in fact find crack cocaine.\r\nIn the affidavit, Deputy Mullineaux noted: â€œBased on the affiantâ€™s and other \r\n  Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department narcotic agents experience in drug enforcement, \r\n  it is known that subjects present at the scene of illegal drug distribution \r\n  and/or possession commonly have drugs in their possession . . . .â€Â  â€œ[E]vidence \r\n  of a sale of drugs supports an inference that more will be found at the place \r\n  of operation.â€Â  State v. Maffeo, 642 P.2d 404, 406 (Wash. Ct. App. 1982) \r\n  (citing 1 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure Â§ 3.7 (1978); United \r\n  States v. Valenzuela, 596 F.2d 824 (9th Cir. 1979)).\r\nUnder these facts, a substantial basis existed to support the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  finding of probable cause.Â  The magistrate had ample probable cause to issue \r\n  the warrant.Â  Given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, there \r\n  was a â€œfair probabilityâ€ that crack cocaine would be found in the mobile home.Â  \r\n  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238.Â  Concomitantly, the court did not \r\n  err in denying Dupreeâ€™s motion to suppress the crack cocaine.\r\nWe hold that if a controlled buy is properly conducted, the controlled \r\n  buy alone can provide facts sufficient to establish probable cause \r\n  for a search warrant.\r\nII.Â  SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT\r\nDupree complains the circuit court judge erred in sentencing him \r\n  â€œfor a second offense of trafficking, where the enhancement was based on a prior \r\n  conviction of possession with intent to distribute rather than a prior conviction \r\n  of trafficking.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe State requested the court treat the trafficking conviction as a second \r\n  offense in sentencing Dupree under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C) (2002).Â  The \r\n  State asserted â€œthis is a second level conviction for enhancing purposes.â€Â  \r\n  In Virginia in 1991, Dupree pled guilty to â€œpossession with intent to distribute \r\n  a Schedule II controlled substance, to-wit, cocaine.â€Â  Defense counsel asked \r\n  the judge to treat this conviction as a first offense â€œbecause the prior drug \r\n  conviction on which the [S]tate was relying was a conviction for possession \r\n  with intent to distribute, not trafficking.â€Â  Defense counsel maintained â€œthe \r\n  specific statute, the crack statute, would take precedence over any general \r\n  statute.â€Â  The court rejected this contention and sentenced Dupree to a term \r\n  within the range provided by Â§ 44-53-375(C) for a second trafficking offense.\r\nA.Â  Statutory Authority: \r\n  Sections 44-53-375(C) &amp; 44-53-470\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C) (2002) provides in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  A person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, purchases, \r\n  or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance or otherwise \r\n  aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver, purchase, \r\n  or bring into this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession \r\n  or who knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of \r\n  ten grams or more of ice, crank, or crack cocaine, as defined and otherwise \r\n  limited in Sections 44-53-110, 44-53-210(b)(4), 44-53-210(d)(1), or 44-53-210(d)(2), \r\n  is guilty of a felony which is known as â€œtrafficking in ice, crank, or crack \r\n  cocaineâ€ and, upon conviction, must be punished as follows if the quantity involved \r\n  is:\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ten grams or more, but less than twenty-eight grams:\r\n    \r\n(a) for a first offense, a term of imprisonment of not less than three years \r\n  nor more than ten years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, \r\n  and a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars;\r\n  (b) for a second offense, a term of imprisonment of not less than five years \r\n  nor more than thirty years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation \r\n  granted, and a fine of fifty thousand dollars.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-470 (2002), â€œ[a]n offense is considered \r\n  a second or subsequent offense, if, prior to his conviction of the offense, \r\n  the offender has at any time been convicted under this article or under any \r\n  State or Federal statute relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, depressant, \r\n  stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs.â€\r\nB.Â  Statutory Construction\r\nPenal statutes are strictly construed against the State and in favor of the \r\n  defendant.Â  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  State v. Fowler, 322 S.C. 157, 470 S.E.2d 393 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The cardinal \r\n  rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative \r\n  intent whenever possible.Â  State v. Baucom, 340 S.C. 339, 531 S.E.2d \r\n  922 (2000); City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d 492 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the \r\n  one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the \r\n  intended purpose of the statute.Â  State v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 \r\n  S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The determination of legislative intent is a matter \r\n  of law.Â  City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, \r\n  330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the \r\n  plain language of the statute.Â  Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. \r\n  334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Words must be given their plain and ordinary \r\n  meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction which limits or expands \r\n  the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 468 S.E.2d 649 \r\n  (1996); City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t, 330 S.C. at 375, 498 S.E.2d at 896.Â Â  \r\n  When faced with an undefined statutory term, the court must interpret the term \r\n  in accord with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Hudson, 336 S.C. at \r\n  246, 519 S.E.2d at 581.\r\nThe terms must be construed in context and their meaning determined by looking \r\n  at the other terms used in the statute.Â  Southern Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. \r\n  South Carolina Windstorm &amp; Hail Underwriting Assâ€™n, 306 S.C. 339, 412 \r\n  S.E.2d 377 (1991).Â  Courts should consider not merely the language of the particular \r\n  clause being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction with the \r\n  purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  Whitner v. State, \r\n  328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997); see also Stephen, 324 S.C. \r\n  at 340, 478 S.E.2d at 77 (statutory provisions should be given reasonable and \r\n  practical construction consistent with purpose and policy of entire act).Â  In \r\n  interpreting a statute, the language of the statute must be construed in a sense \r\n  which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  \r\n  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992); \r\n  Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582.Â  Statutes must be read as \r\n  a whole and sections which are part of the same general statutory scheme must \r\n  be construed together and each given effect, if it can be done by any reasonable \r\n  construction.Â  Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d 799 (1992).\r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite \r\n  meaning, there is no need to employ rules of statutory interpretation and the \r\n  court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Paschal v. State \r\n  Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); Brassell, 326 \r\n  S.C. at 560, 486 S.E.2d at 494.Â  When the terms of a statute are clear, the \r\n  court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  Holley \r\n  v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994).Â  However, \r\n  if the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative \r\n  intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of \r\n  the act itself.Â  Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at 582.Â Â  The statute \r\n  as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant \r\n  with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.Â  Brassell, 326 S.C. \r\n  at 561, 486 S.E.2d at 495.Â  Any ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in \r\n  favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of the law.Â  City of \r\n  Sumter Police Depâ€™t, 330 S.C. at 376, 498 S.E.2d at 896.\r\nC.Â  â€œSecond Offenseâ€ \r\n  Category\r\nDupree contends that possession with intent to distribute cocaine \r\n  does not qualify as a prior offense for the purpose of Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1)(b).Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nDupree cites Rainey v. State, 307 S.C. 150, 414 S.E.2d 131 \r\n  (1992), in support of his argument.Â  Rainey pled guilty to distribution of crack \r\n  cocaine and resisting arrest.Â  He was sentenced as a second offender for the \r\n  distribution charge to thirty years, suspended upon the service of twenty-five \r\n  years, and a payment of a $50,000 fine.Â  Our Supreme Court affirmed the case \r\n  on direct appeal.Â  The post-conviction relief (PCR) judge granted Raineyâ€™s application \r\n  for PCR.Â  On appeal, the Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\nRespondent was sentenced as a second offender under the crack cocaine statute[, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (Supp. 1990),] based on his prior convictions for \r\n  distribution of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to Â§ 44-53-375(B), an enhanced sentence is required for â€œa second offender, \r\n  or if, in the case of a first conviction of a violation of this section, the \r\n  offender has been convicted of any [law] . . . relating to narcotic drugs \r\n  . . . .â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Since respondent does not have a prior crack cocaine \r\n  conviction and marijuana is not a narcotic drug as defined by S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-110 (1985), he should not have been sentenced as a second offender under \r\n  Â§ 44-53-375(B).\r\n\r\nRainey, 307 S.C. at 151, 414 S.E.2d at 132 (footnote omitted).Â  The \r\n  State asserted Rainey was a second offender under Â§ 44-53-470.Â  In affirming \r\n  the order of the PCR judge, the Court explained:\r\n\r\nBecause there is a conflict between Â§ 44-53-375(B) and the general second offense \r\n  statute, the later, more specific crack cocaine statute must prevail.Â  The PCR \r\n  judge was correct in finding that respondent is not a second offender under \r\n  Â§ 44-53-375(B) and should not, therefore, have been sentenced as one.\r\n\r\nRainey, 307 S.C. at 152, 414 S.E.2d at 132.\r\nRainey is inapposite to the case at bar.Â  The Rainey Court was construing \r\n  the previous Â§ 44-53-375(B).Â  Section 44-53-375(B) permitted â€œsecond offender \r\n  sentencingâ€ in regard to a prior offense â€œrelating to narcotic drugs.â€Â  \r\n  Rainey, 307 S.C. at 151, 414 S.E.2d at 132 (emphasis in original).Â  Marijuana \r\n  is not a narcotic drug.Â  The statute has since been amended and now reads in \r\n  relevant part:\r\n\r\n(B) A person who manufactures, distributes, dispenses, delivers, purchases, \r\n  or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to manufacture, distribute, \r\n  dispense, deliver, or purchase, or possesses with intent to distribute, dispense, \r\n  or deliver ice, crank, or crack cocaine, in violation of the provisions of Section \r\n  44-53-370, is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction:\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  (2) for a second offense or if, in the case of a first conviction of a violation \r\n  of this section, the offender has been convicted of any of the laws of the United \r\n  States or of any state, territory, or district relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, \r\n  depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs, the offender must be imprisoned \r\n  for not more than twenty-five years and fined not less than fifty thousand dollars.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 44-53-375(B)(2) (2002) (emphasis added).Â  Section 44-53-375(C)(1)(b), \r\n  the statute under which Dupree was sentenced, does not contain language \r\n  similar to that in Â§ 44-53-375(B), which was the focus of Rainey.\r\nThe case of Thomas v. State, 319 S.C. 471, 465 S.E.2d 350 \r\n  (1995), is enlightening.Â  Thomas was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and \r\n  sentenced as a third-time offender under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1) (Supp. \r\n  1994).Â  Thomas had prior convictions for possession of marijuana with intent \r\n  to distribute and distribution of marijuana.Â  When Thomasâ€™ direct appeal was \r\n  dismissed, he filed an application for PCR on the ground his sentence exceeded \r\n  the maximum allowed by law.Â  The PCR judge granted Thomas a resentencing hearing.\r\nOn appeal, the State claimed the PCR judge erred in finding the trial \r\n  judge had improperly interpreted the term â€œsubsequent or second offense.â€Â  The \r\n  Court noted that Â§ 44-53-470 defines â€œsecond or subsequent offenseâ€ as â€œwhen \r\n  an offender â€˜has at any time been convicted under this article or under any \r\n  State or Federal statute relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, depressant, \r\n  stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs.â€™â€Â  Id. at 472, 465 S.E.2d at 351 \r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  The Court discussed:\r\n\r\n  Respondent argues the references to second or subsequent offenses in Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1) \r\n  refer only to convictions of trafficking in marijuana, not other drug offenses.Â  \r\n  Relying on Rainey v. State, 307 S.C. 150, 414 S.E.2d 131 (1992), respondent \r\n  contends the definition set out in Â§ 44-53-470 does not apply to Â§ 44-53-370(e).Â  \r\n  In Rainey, the defendant was convicted under the former crack cocaine \r\n  statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375.Â  His prior offense was for marijuana.Â  \r\n  Under former Â§ 44-53-375(B), the prior offense had to be related to narcotic \r\n  drugs.Â  However, under the definition set out in Â§ 44-53-470, a prior offense \r\n  is any drug offense.Â  Finding a conflict between Â§ 44-53-470 and Â§ 44-53-375(B) \r\n  and applying the rule that the more recent legislation supersedes prior law, \r\n  the Court held the defendant should not have been sentenced as a second offender.Â  \r\n  Here, Â§Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1) and 44-53-470 are not in conflict.Â  Since there is \r\n  no conflict, Rainey does not apply.\r\n\r\nThomas, 319 S.C. at 472-73, 465 S.E.2d at 351 (footnote omitted).Â  The \r\n  Court, in a footnote, recognized that Â§ 44-53-375(B) has been amended and now \r\n  states a prior offense includes those for marijuana.Â  In reversing the order \r\n  of the PCR judge, the Court expounded:\r\n\r\n  Here, both statutes are part of the same general law and can be read together \r\n  without any conflict.Â  Cf. In re Keith Lamont G., 304 S.C. 456, \r\n  405 S.E.2d 404 (1991) (statutory sections that are part of the same general \r\n  statutory law must be construed together).Â  Further, the cardinal rule of statutory \r\n  construction is that legislative intent is to prevail.Â  Browning v. Hartvigsen, \r\n  307 S.C. 122, 414 S.E.2d 115 (1992).Â  The legislature could not have intended \r\n  second or subsequent offenses under Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1) to include only the offense \r\n  of marijuana trafficking when there is a specific statute which defines second \r\n  or subsequent offenses as any drug offense.Â  Therefore, we hold respondent was \r\n  correctly sentenced as a third-time offender.\r\n\r\nThomas, 319 S.C. at 473, 465 S.E.2d at 352.\r\n Thomas v. State is analogous to the present case.Â  Sections \r\n  44-53-375(C)(1)(b) and 44-53-470 are not in conflict.Â  There is no specific \r\n  enhancement language in Â§ 44-53-375(C).Â  It merely delineates \r\n  offenses.Â  Because there is no conflict between these statutory sections, \r\n  Rainey does not apply.Â  Section 44-53-470 applies to Â§ 44-53-375(C).Â  \r\n  The trial judge correctly sentenced Dupree as a second offender.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Dupreeâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n CURETON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
