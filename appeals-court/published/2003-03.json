McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka; \r\n  and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.:Â  Raquib Al-Amin was convicted of murder.Â  \r\n  Al-Amin appeals alleging the Circuit Court erred in denying his motion for a \r\n  directed verdict.Â  Additionally, Al-Amin asserts he is entitled to a new trial \r\n  because the Circuit Court allowed admission of his prior armed robbery conviction \r\n  and excluded Al-Aminâ€™s testimony implicating third party guilt.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAround 3:30 p.m. on August 25, 1997, Michael Watkins, the manager \r\n  of Churchill Place Apartments, was returning to the apartment complex and pulled \r\n  into the parking lot.Â  When Watkins looked out of his windshield, he noticed \r\n  Al-Amin dragging something out of his apartment that was â€œconsistent with being \r\n  a [human] bodyâ€ wrapped in a pink blanket.Â  When Al-Amin became aware of Watkins \r\n  watching him, he dragged the blanket back into his apartment.Â  Watkins became \r\n  suspicious.Â  After he parked, Watkins decided to wait in his vehicle for several \r\n  more minutes.Â Â  About five minutes later, Al-Amin walked out of the apartment \r\n  and noticed Watkins was still sitting in his vehicle.Â  Al-Amin smiled at Watkins, \r\n  waved his hand at him, and went upstairs as if nothing was going on.Â  Within \r\n  minutes, Al-Amin returned to his apartment.\r\nAfter this incident, Watkins went to his office.Â  At approximately \r\n  4:00 p.m., while in his office, Watkins observed Al-Amin walking across the \r\n  catwalk from apartment 220, which was the victimâ€™s apartment.Â  At 5:30 p.m., \r\n  Watkins, still suspicious, checked the dumpster closest to Al-Aminâ€™s apartment.Â  \r\n  Watkins found the pink blanket which he had earlier seen Al-Amin dragging \r\n  from his apartment.Â Â  Watkins pulled aside part of the blanket and saw a human \r\n  arm.Â  He then called 911.\r\nOfficer Michael Mahon, with the City of Columbia \r\n  Police Department, responded to the 911 call.Â  Watkins advised Officer Mahon \r\n  that he had seen Al-Amin dragging a body wrapped in a blanket from apartment \r\n  four to the dumpster.Â  Officer Mahon walked over to the dumpster and confirmed \r\n  there was a body in the dumpster.Â  Officer Mahon stated he could â€œsee what looked \r\n  like a patch of brown skin, maybe part of an arm or a leg.â€Â  After verifying \r\n  there was a body in the dumpster, Officer Mahon called for an ambulance crew.Â  \r\n  Several officers arrived to help secure the scene and provide back-up.\r\nOfficer Dee Ann Johnson was present when the body \r\n  was removed from the dumpster.Â  According to Officer Johnson, â€œthere was bleeding \r\n  from the nose and there was a gash over [the victimâ€™s] left eye and also some \r\n  marks on her neck.â€Â  The coroner discovered a crack pipe in the crotch area \r\n  of the victimâ€™s shorts.\r\nWatkins related his story to the police.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  a warrant was obtained to search Al-Aminâ€™s apartment.Â  While searching the apartment, \r\n  the police found: a large construction bolt which had black electrical tape \r\n  wrapped around the threaded end with the victimâ€™s blood on it; a shower curtain \r\n  with human blood on it; carpet with human blood on it; a savings account bank \r\n  book with Al-Aminâ€™s name on it; a box of checks with Al-Aminâ€™s name on them; \r\n  and Al-Aminâ€™s bills with his name and the apartmentâ€™s address on them.\r\nAt the autopsy, Investigator Walter E. Bales â€œnoticed \r\n  there was blunt trauma or striking injuries on the victim . . . [that] looked \r\n  like they were caused by the head of [the] boltâ€ found in Al-Aminâ€™s apartment.Â  \r\n  The pathologist who performed the victimâ€™s autopsy testified there were four \r\n  deep, full-thickness lacerations, which were all slightly curved, on the victimâ€™s \r\n  face and head.Â  When asked â€œ[w]hat type of blow would cause injury all the way \r\n  to someoneâ€™s bone in their head,â€ the pathologist opined:Â  â€œThatâ€™s an injury \r\n  with significant force that is generally caused by a heavy object being swung \r\n  with force.â€Â  The pathologist further declared the victim had injuries to her \r\n  neck that were â€œassociated with someone who has been manually strangledâ€ and \r\n  that she most likely died of the strangulation, although the blows to the head \r\n  were sufficient to have caused death.\r\nAl-Amin was charged with murder.Â  He was convicted \r\n  and sentenced to life without parole.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict \r\n  Motion\r\nAl-Amin argues the Circuit Court erred when it denied his motion \r\n  for directed verdict because the State failed to present sufficient evidence \r\n  to convict him on the murder charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal case, \r\n  an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State \r\n  v. Morgan, Â Â Â S.C.Â Â  , 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The \r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not \r\n  its weight.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); State \r\n  v. Dudley, Op. No. 3579 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 9, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 41 at 57).Â  When a motion for a directed verdict is made in a criminal \r\n  case where the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence, the trial \r\n  judge is required to submit the case to the jury if there is any substantial \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which \r\n  his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 \r\n  S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled \r\n  to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce any direct or substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. Rothschild, \r\n  351 S.C. 238, 569 S.E.2d 346 (2002); State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 562 \r\n  S.E.2d 313 (2002).\r\nIn this case, the State presented substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n  pointing to Al-Aminâ€™s guilt.Â  Watkins observed Al-Amin dragging something out \r\n  of his apartment that was â€œconsistent with being a [human] bodyâ€ wrapped in \r\n  a pink blanket.Â  Watkins found this same pink blanket containing the victimâ€™s \r\n  body in the dumpster closest to Al-Aminâ€™s apartment later that day.\r\nOur courts have held that concealment of the body of a murdered person is a \r\n  circumstance which tends to show guilt and should go to the jury to weigh the \r\n  evidence.Â  See State v. Ridgely, 251 S.C. 556, 164 S.E.2d 439 \r\n  (1968); State v. Epes, 209 S.C. 246, 39 S.E.2d 769 (1946).Â  In State \r\n  v. Ridgely, the Supreme Court, quoting State v. Epes, discussed this \r\n  principle:\r\nThe facts in this case are similar in many respects to the \r\n  facts in the case of State v. Epes, 209 S.C. 246, 39 S.E.2d 769 (1946).Â  \r\n  In that case the accused reported to the police the disappearance of his wife \r\n  and pretended to aid in search of her.Â  Later he admitted that he had concealed \r\n  her body and led the police to an improvised grave.Â  It was his contention that \r\n  his wife took an overdose of medicine and died as a result of it.Â  In that case, \r\n  as here, the law of circumstantial evidence was largely relied upon by the State.Â  \r\n  Referring to concealment of the body of a murdered person, this court said:\r\n\r\nThe general rule is that the concealment or the attempted \r\n  destruction of a body of a person murdered is regarded as an incriminating circumstance \r\n  and will be given probative force in connection with other facts.Â  See \r\n  Annotation, 2 A.L.R. 1227, and the numerous cases there cited to sustain this \r\n  proposition; and also, Wigmore on Evidence, 2d Ed., Secs. 32, 172, 267, \r\n  272 and 276.\r\nThe action of the appellant in concealing the body of his \r\n  wife so as to divert suspicion from himself was a relevant circumstance tending \r\n  to show guilt, and it was for the jury to estimate its weight, and it was for \r\n  the jury to determine whether his explanation and the motive he assigned were \r\n  truthful or otherwise.Â  39 S.E.2d at 777.\r\n\r\nId. at 565, 164 S.E.2d at 443 (internal quotation marks omitted); see \r\n  also 40A Am. Jur. 2d Homicide Â§ 462 (1999) (concealment or attempted \r\n  destruction of body of murder victim is regarded as incriminating circumstance \r\n  and will be given probative force in connection with other facts; an inference \r\n  of guilt may be drawn therefrom).Â  Cf. State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. \r\n  302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999) (attempted destruction of evidence is regarded as \r\n  a relevant incriminating circumstance).\r\nThe police discovered a construction bolt with the \r\n  victimâ€™s blood on it in the closet in Al-Aminâ€™s apartment.Â  Investigator Bales \r\n  testified that â€œthe gouge marks into the victimâ€™s head looked like they were \r\n  the same size as the head of that bolt.â€Â  Dr. Sally A. Harding, the pathologist \r\n  who performed the autopsy on the victim, described four deep injuries to the \r\n  victimâ€™s face and head.Â  Harding stated a heavy object being swung with force \r\n  generally causes the types of injuries sustained by the victim.Â  Harding declared \r\n  three of the four injuries were 2.8 centimeters long, which is the same size \r\n  as the bolt found in Al-Aminâ€™s apartment.Â  When asked whether the bolt was consistent \r\n  with the length of the injuries to the victimâ€™s head, Dr. Harding responded: \r\n  â€œYes, that would be consistent with the length of the injury and the type of \r\n  implement that could have inflicted this type of full-thickness laceration.â€ \r\n  Harding observed marks on the victimâ€™s neck which were consistent with manual \r\n  strangulation.Â  At the time Al-Amin reported to the police station, he had scratches \r\n  on the left side of his face, on his cheek and lips, which were indicative of \r\n  a struggle.\r\nUpon searching Al-Aminâ€™s apartment, the police noticed the apartment had been \r\n  cleaned and there was a smell of mothballs about the apartment. Further, the \r\n  police detected human blood on the shower curtain and carpet inside the apartment.Â  \r\n  Al-Aminâ€™s bed had no blanket or bedspread on it. Darryl Cunningham professed \r\n  he saw Al-Amin with the victim in Al-Aminâ€™s apartment around 2:30 p.m. that \r\n  day and that Al-Amin and the victim were alone when Cunningham left.Â  At the \r\n  scene, police observed that the victimâ€™s body was fairly limp and the blood \r\n  was still wet and appeared to be fresh.\r\nIn addition, Al-Amin fled the scene.Â  Flight from prosecution is admissible \r\n  as evidence of guilt.Â  See State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 292 \r\n  S.E.2d 581 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  â€œ[A]ttempts to run away have always been \r\n  regarded as some evidence of guilty knowledge and intent.â€Â  State v. Grant, \r\n  275 S.C. 404, 407, 272 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted) \r\n  (clarifying that while a jury charge on flight as evidence of guilt is improper, \r\n  admission of evidence and argument by counsel concerning it are allowed).Â  See \r\n  also State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999) (evidence \r\n  of flight has been held to constitute evidence of guilty knowledge and intent); \r\n  State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 200, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (â€œflight \r\n  . . . is at least some evidence of guiltâ€); Thompson, 278 S.C. at 10-11, \r\n  292 S.E.2d at 587 (evidence of flight admissible to show guilty knowledge, intent, \r\n  and that defendant sought to avoid apprehension).\r\nThese facts, especially Al-Aminâ€™s apparent attempt \r\n  to conceal the body and his flight from the scene, constitute substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence presented by the State to warrant submission of the case to the jury.Â  \r\n  The motion for directed verdict was properly denied.\r\nII.Â  Prior Armed \r\n  Robbery Conviction\r\nAl-Amin claims he is entitled to a new trial because the Circuit Court erred \r\n  when it allowed the State to introduce evidence of Al-Aminâ€™s prior armed robbery \r\n  conviction without making a probative value/prejudicial effect analysis.Â  Al-Amin \r\n  was convicted of armed robbery in 1988 and was released from confinement in \r\n  1991.Â  He remained on parole until 1994.Â  Al-Aminâ€™s trial and conviction occurred \r\n  in 2000.Â  Clearly, Al-Aminâ€™s release from confinement in 1991 falls within the \r\n  ten-year time limit provided by Rule 609(b), SCRE.\r\nThe State argues that, since Al-Aminâ€™s prior armed robbery conviction fell \r\n  within the time limits for admission, the Circuit Court could admit evidence \r\n  regarding the armed robbery conviction without weighing the probative value \r\n  against the prejudicial effect because armed robbery is considered a crime of \r\n  dishonesty under Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE. \r\nRule 609, SCRE, which governs the admissibility of prior crimes to attack the \r\n  credibility of a witness, provides:\r\n\r\n(a) General rule.Â  For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a \r\n  witness,\r\n  \r\n(1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime \r\n  shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if the crime was punishable by death \r\n  or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness \r\n  was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime \r\n  shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting \r\n  this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused; and\r\n(2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted \r\n  if it involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n(b) Time limit.Â  Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible \r\n  if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction \r\n  or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, \r\n  whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of \r\n  justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts \r\n  and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether armed robbery is a crime of dishonesty in this state \r\n  is novel.Â  For guidance and edification, we look to the federal authorities \r\n  and other state jurisdictions.\r\nA.Â  Rule 609(a)(2) \r\n  in the Federal Jurisdictions\r\nThere is disagreement among federal circuit courts and state courts \r\n  construing Rule 609(a)(2) as to which crimes are included.Â  The disagreement \r\n  revolves around whether convictions for theft crimes, such as larceny, robbery, \r\n  and shoplifting, should be admitted under the rule as involving dishonesty or \r\n  false statement.\r\nA majority of the federal circuits and the Conference Committee for the federal \r\n  rules limit crimes of dishonesty to those involving crimen falsi.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., United States v. Fearwell, 595 F.2d 771 (D.C. \r\n  Cir. 1978); United States v. Ashley, 569 F.2d 975 (5th Cir. 1978); United \r\n  States v. Carroll, 663 F. Supp. 210 (D. Md. 1986).Â  â€œThe original House-Senate \r\n  Conference Committee Report explained that crimes involving dishonesty and false \r\n  statement â€˜means crimes such as perjury or subornation of perjury, false statement, \r\n  criminal fraud, embezzlement, or false pretense, or any other offense in the \r\n  nature of crimen falsi, the commission of which involves some \r\n  element of deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on the accusedâ€™s \r\n  propensity to testify truthfully.â€™â€Â  4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, \r\n  Weinsteinâ€™s Federal Evidence, Â§ 609.04[3][a] (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed., \r\n  2d ed. 2002).\r\nCrimen falsi means â€œthe crime of falsifying.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law \r\n  Dictionary 379 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Crimen falsi has been defined \r\n  as â€œ[a] crime in the nature of perjuryâ€; â€œ[a]ny other offense that involves \r\n  some element of dishonesty or false statement.â€Â  Id.Â  Crimes involving \r\n  crimen falsi include perjury, false statement, false pretense, \r\n  criminal fraud, or embezzlement.Â  See E. Warren Moise, Impeachment \r\n  Evidence: Attacking and Supporting the Credibility of Witnesses in South Carolina \r\n  109 (1996).Â  Convictions solely involving the use of force, such as assault \r\n  and battery, or crimes such as public drunkenness or prostitution, generally \r\n  are not admissible under Federal Rule 609(a)(2).Â  Id.\r\nBecause the federal courts have adopted a narrow interpretation of the words \r\n  â€œdishonesty or false statementâ€ in Rule 609(a)(2), most have decided robbery \r\n  is not a crime of dishonesty.Â  See, e.g., United States v. \r\n  Grandmont, 680 F.2d 867 (1st Cir. 1982) (robbery per se is not a crime of \r\n  dishonesty under the federal rule); United States v. Alexander, 48 F.3d \r\n  1477 (9th Cir. 1995) (prior robbery convictions are not admissible for impeachment \r\n  purposes under Rule 609(a)(2)); United States v. Brackeen, 969 F.2d 827 \r\n  (9th Cir. 1992) (bank robbery is not per se crime of dishonesty for purposes \r\n  of rule allowing impeachment of witness by evidence that he has been convicted \r\n  of crime involving dishonesty); United States v. Dunson, 142 F.3d 1213 \r\n  (10th Cir. 1998) (prior conviction for robbery is not automatically admissible \r\n  under Rule 609(a)(2)); United States v. Sellers, 906 F.2d 597, 603 (11th \r\n  Cir. 1990) (â€œIt is established in this Circuit . . . that crimes such as theft, \r\n  robbery, or shoplifting do not involve â€˜dishonesty or false statementâ€™ within \r\n  the meaning of Rule 609(a)(2).â€); see also Weinsteinâ€™s Federal Evidence, \r\n  Â§ 609.04[3][c] (â€œrobbery is generally held not to constitute a crime of dishonestyâ€ \r\n  under Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence); 1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., \r\n  McCormick on Evidence Â§ 42, at 161 (John W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999) \r\n  (â€œ[F]ederal courts and most state courts are unwilling to classify offenses \r\n  such as petty larceny, shoplifting, [and] robbery . . . as per se crimes of \r\n  â€˜dishonesty or false statement.â€™â€).\r\nThe precedent set by the federal circuit courts is not binding on this Court.Â  \r\n  See Bazzle v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 351 S.C. 244, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  349 (2002), cert. granted, 123 S.Ct. 817 (Jan. 10, 2003).Â  We decline \r\n  to follow the federal courtsâ€™ restrictive interpretation of the phrase â€œdishonesty \r\n  or false statementâ€ in Rule 609(a)(2).\r\nB.Â  Construction \r\n  of Rule 609(a)(2) by Other State Courts\r\nThe majority of other state courts which have considered the question of whether \r\n  robbery is a crime of dishonesty for purposes of Rule 609(a)(2) have answered \r\n  in the affirmative.Â  See Jane Massey Draper, Annotation, What Constitutes \r\n  Crime Involving â€œDishonesty or False Statementâ€ Under Rule 609(a)(2) of Uniform \r\n  Rules of Evidence or Similar State Rule â€“ Crimes Involving Violence or Potential \r\n  for Violence, 83 A.L.R. 5th 277 (2000) (listing in section 11 that Alaska, \r\n  Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington have found \r\n  robbery to be a crime of dishonesty while Minnesota, North Dakota, and Utah \r\n  have not).\r\nPrior convictions, depending on the nature of the offense, may have \r\n  different types of probative value relative to a witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  Crimes \r\n  of dishonesty and those involving false statement have an obvious bearing on \r\n  a defendantâ€™s credibility.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Alaska, in Alexander v. State, 611 P.2d 469 (Alaska \r\n  1980), concluded robbery was a crime of dishonesty under that stateâ€™s very similar \r\n  rule of evidence.Â  The court stated: â€œAlthough robbery involves the additional \r\n  element of force or putting in fear, it, like larceny, concerns the unlawful \r\n  taking of something of value.â€Â  Id. at 476 (footnotes omitted).Â  In a \r\n  footnote, the court further added: â€œIt is the larceny element of robbery which \r\n  makes such a conviction admissible as impeachment of a witness.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 476 n.18.\r\nAlthough Connecticut has a test which is different from our Rule \r\n  609(a)(2), case law from that state is enlightening.Â  In State v. Dawkins, \r\n  681 A.2d 989 (Conn. App. Ct. 1996), the Appellate Court of Connecticut elucidated:\r\n\r\nTwo general categories of prior convictions are \r\n  admissible for impeachment.Â  â€œFirst are those crimes that by their very nature \r\n  indicate dishonesty or tendency to make false statement. . . . The second category \r\n  involves convictions for crimes that do not reflect directly on the credibility \r\n  of one who has been convicted of them.â€Â  It is recognized in Connecticut courts \r\n  â€œthat crimes involving larcenous intent imply a general disposition toward dishonesty \r\n  such that they also fall within this [first] category. . . . Convictions of \r\n  this sort obviously bear heavily on the credibility of one who has been convicted \r\n  of them.Â  The probative value of such convictions, therefore, may often outweigh \r\n  any prejudice engendered by their admission.â€Â  The prior convictions at issue \r\n  here fall within the first category.Â  Each involved a prior conviction for larceny.\r\n\r\nId. at 994 (citations omitted).Â  Thereafter, in State v. Banks, \r\n  755 A.2d 279 (Conn. App. Ct. 2000), the Connecticut court reiterated:\r\n\r\n[Our Supreme Court] has recognized that crimes involving \r\n  larcenous intent imply a general disposition toward dishonesty or a tendency \r\n  to make false statements. . . . [Furthermore] larceny, which is the underlying \r\n  crime in any robbery, bears directly on the credibility of the witness-defendant.Â  \r\n  Thus, in the present case, the defendantâ€™s prior convictions of larceny and \r\n  robbery were highly probative of his truthfulness and veracity.\r\n\r\nId. at 289 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nThe Supreme Court of Delaware has â€œconstrued the phrase â€˜dishonesty \r\n  or false statementâ€™ in D.R.E. 609 to mean that crimes involving dishonest conduct \r\n  as well as crimes involving false statements are admissible for impeachment \r\n  purposes.â€Â  Gregory v. State, 616 A.2d 1198, 1204 (Del. 1992).Â  See \r\n  also Morris v. State, 795 A.2d 653, 665 (Del. 2002) (noting â€œâ€˜prior \r\n  conviction[] for robbery . . . clearly ha[s] been determined by this Court to \r\n  be [a] crime[] involving dishonest conductâ€™â€ under Rule 609(a)(2)).\r\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in Bates v. United States, \r\n  403 A.2d 1159 (D.C. 1979), noted that Congress, in legislating for the District \r\n  of Columbia, had an expansive view of â€œdishonesty or false statement.â€Â  The \r\n  Bates court emphasized: â€œâ€˜The offenses which involve dishonesty or false \r\n  statement and which may be used in the discretion of the cross-examining party \r\n  include, but are not limited to, any offense involving fraud, or intent to defraud, \r\n  larceny, robbery . . . .â€™â€Â  Id. at 1161.\r\nIn finding the trial court properly denied the defendantâ€™s motion \r\n  to prohibit the introduction of his prior convictions for armed robbery, the \r\n  Appellate Court of Illinois, in People v. Dee, 325 N.E.2d 336 (Ill. App. \r\n  Ct. 1975), explained:\r\n\r\nWhile the crime of robbery involves an element of violence, \r\n  this does not remove it from the category of crimes which involve dishonesty.Â  \r\n  Robbery is a form of stealing [and is a crime] which reflect[s] on the honesty \r\n  and integrity of the perpetrator.Â  Robbery is not a crime of passion or violence \r\n  done in response to some form of provocation.Â  It is generally a preplanned \r\n  crime designed to steal property from a person in rightful possession.Â  We are \r\n  of the opinion that a prior conviction for the crime of robbery, whether armed \r\n  or otherwise, is probative of the perpetratorâ€™s honesty and veracity as a witness.\r\n\r\nId. at 341-42; see also People v. Paul, 710 N.E.2d 499 \r\n  (Ill. App. Ct. 1999) (armed robbery has been treated as a crime of dishonesty); \r\n  People v. Thomas, 580 N.E.2d 1353 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (robbery is a \r\n  crime of dishonesty for Rule 609 impeachment purposes; stating that robbery \r\n  is a veracity-related crime and a conviction thereof is probative of defendantâ€™s \r\n  credibility); People v. Harris, 580 N.E.2d 1342 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) \r\n  (theft-related offenses, such as armed robbery, obviously involve dishonesty \r\n  and arguably reflect on a personâ€™s likelihood of telling the truth when testifying \r\n  as a witness).\r\nThe Supreme Court of Kansas examined the issue in State v. Thomas, \r\n  551 P.2d 873 (Kan. 1976):\r\n\r\n[R]obbery, larceny, and burglary, while not showing a propensity \r\n  to falsify, do disclose a disregard for the rights of others which might reasonably \r\n  be expected to express itself in giving false testimony whenever it would be \r\n  to the advantage of the witness.Â  If the witness had no compunctions against \r\n  stealing anotherâ€™s property or taking it away from him by physical threat or \r\n  force, it is hard to see why he would hesitate to obtain an advantage for himself \r\n  or friend in a trial by giving false testimony.Â  Furthermore, such criminal \r\n  acts, although evidenced by a single conviction, may represent such a marked \r\n  breach from sanctioned conduct that it affords a reasonable basis of future \r\n  prediction upon credibility.\r\n\r\nId. at 876 (internal quotations omitted); see also State v. \r\n  Davis, 874 P.2d 1156 (Kan. 1994) (noting that cross-examination of defense \r\n  witness concerning prior robbery conviction was proper impeachment because robbery \r\n  is a crime of dishonesty under the applicable Kansas Rule of Evidence).\r\nIn State v. Johnson, 460 N.E.2d 625 (Ohio Ct. App. 1983), \r\n  the Court of Appeals of Ohio discussed the dishonesty prong of that stateâ€™s \r\n  Rule 609:\r\n\r\n[D]efendant contends that â€œdishonesty,â€ as used in the rule, \r\n  is limited to crimen falsi, namely, fraud, perjury and similar offenses.\r\nWhile there is some support for defendantâ€™s position in \r\n  some federal cases, courts of some states have defined â€œdishonestyâ€ in a much \r\n  broader sense so as to include theft offenses.Â  Although there is some suggestion \r\n  of limitation in the Staff Notes to the rule, it is inconceivable that the drafters \r\n  of the rule would not have been more precise and used more limiting language, \r\n  such as crimen falsi or fraud, had such a limitation been intended, rather \r\n  than using the much broader term â€œdishonesty.â€Â  Clearly and undisputedly, a \r\n  theft is inherently dishonest.Â  Common sense dictates that stealing is a dishonest \r\n  act. While dishonesty also includes deceit, it is not limited thereto. . . . \r\n  Since a theft offense could be used to impeach under the common law, and in \r\n  common parlance theft involves dishonesty, we are constrained to the common-sense \r\n  conclusion that dishonest acts such as receiving stolen property and stealing \r\n  are included within the meaning of the word â€œdishonesty,â€ as used in Evid. R. \r\n  609(A)(2).\r\n\r\nId. at 629 (citations omitted).Â  See also State v. Rogers, \r\n  No. 77723, 2000 WL 1714912, at *3 (Ohio Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2000) (â€œOhio courts \r\n  have consistently held that theft, robbery and aggravated robbery are crimes \r\n  of dishonesty and, therefore, a conviction for theft can be used for impeachment.â€); \r\n  State v. Tolliver, 514 N.E.2d 922 (Ohio Ct. App. 1986) (theft offenses \r\n  are crimes of dishonesty within meaning of Rule 609 and may be used to impeach \r\n  credibility of witness).\r\n State v. Goad, 692 S.W.2d 32 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1985), a case \r\n  decided by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee, is particularly instructive:\r\n\r\nThe defendantâ€™s contention that a previous armed robbery \r\n  conviction cannot be used for the purposes of impeachment because it is not \r\n  a crime involving dishonesty is without merit or support in the law of this \r\n  state.\r\nIn State v. Fluellen, 626 S.W.2d 299 (Tenn. Crim. \r\n  App. 1981), this Court held that armed robbery could be used to test the credibility \r\n  of a testifying defendant because it was a form of larceny, a crime which involves \r\n  dishonesty.Â  The Supreme Court of this State held in State v. Martin, \r\n  642 S.W.2d 720 (Tenn. 1982), that a conviction for an attempt to commit armed \r\n  robbery fell within the dishonesty classification.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\nTo convince us that armed robbery is not a crime of dishonesty, \r\n  the defendant cites us to United States v. Smith, 551 F.2d 348 (D.C. \r\n  Cir. 1976), which held that armed robbery is not admissible for impeachment \r\n  purposes because it does not involve dishonesty.Â  We think that Court failed \r\n  to recognize an essential element of armed robbery or an attempt to commit the \r\n  offense. An essential element of robbery is that the perpetrator of the offense \r\n  steals the goods and chattels of another or, in the case of an attempt to commit \r\n  robbery, intends to steal the goods or chattels of the person assaulted.Â  If \r\n  this element is not present, the crime is not robbery or an attempted robbery.Â  \r\n  Stealing is defined in law as larceny.Â  Larceny involves dishonesty.Â  The fact \r\n  that the perpetrator of the crime manifests or declares his dishonesty by brazenly \r\n  committing the crime does not make him an honest person.Â  We hold, as has been \r\n  previously held, that convictions for these offenses are admissible in this \r\n  state for impeachment purposes.\r\n\r\nId. at 37; see also State v. Galmore, 994 S.W.2d 120, \r\n  122 (Tenn. 1999) (â€œRobbery is a crime involving dishonesty and may be used for \r\n  impeachment purposes.â€); State v. Caruthers, 676 S.W.2d 935 (Tenn. 1984) \r\n  (armed robbery involves dishonesty).\r\nAppellate entities in Washington have likewise recognized that robbery \r\n  is a crime involving dishonesty.Â  The Court of Appeals of Washington illuminated:\r\n\r\nAlthough robbery involves assaultive behavior, it also involves \r\n  theft.Â  We see no merit to the argument that a personâ€™s propensity to give false \r\n  testimony may be shown only by instances of past lying; for it is a fact of \r\n  life that in many situations, actions speak more loudly than words.Â  Robbery \r\n  is not considered an â€œhonestâ€ endeavor by society and is not so viewed by this \r\n  court. . . . [W]e hold that robbery is a crime involving dishonesty.Â  As such, \r\n  the defendantâ€™s conviction was admissible for impeachment purposes under the \r\n  plain language of ER 609(a)(2) and the trial court did not err in so ruling \r\n  in response to the defendantâ€™s motion in limine at the outset of the trial.\r\n\r\nState v. Turner, 665 P.2d 923, 925 (Wash. Ct. App. 1983).Â  In a later \r\n  case holding that robbery was a crime involving dishonesty and, thus, admissible \r\n  under Rule 609(a)(2), the Court of Appeals of Washington declared â€œ[t]he taking \r\n  of the property of another whether by stealth, subterfuge, fraud or by threat \r\n  or force is dishonest and bears on the credibility of an accused.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Saldano, 675 P.2d 1231, 1235 (Wash. Ct. App. 1984).Â  See also \r\n  State v. Rivers, 921 P.2d 495, 498 (Wash. 1996) (â€œTwo of Defendant Riversâ€™ \r\n  prior crimes, robbery and attempted robbery, involved dishonesty and therefore \r\n  were per se admissible for impeachment purposes under [Rule] 609(a)(2).â€); State \r\n  v. Brown, 782 P.2d 1013, 1031 (Wash. 1989), opinion corrected on other \r\n  grounds, 787 P.2d 906 (Wash. 1990) (â€œ[W]e include robbery as per se admissible \r\n  under [Rule] 609(a)(2) because it is not purely an assaultive crime, but also \r\n  involves the larcenous taking of property.â€).\r\nCourts in Florida, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, and Pennsylvania \r\n  have held that robbery is a crime of dishonesty within the meaning of Rule 609(a)(2).Â  \r\n  See, e.g., State v. Page, 449 So. 2d 813 (Fla. 1984) (finding \r\n  that any offense falling within the scope of Chapter 812, which deals with â€œTheft, \r\n  Robbery, and Related Crimes,â€ of the Florida Statutes, necessarily involves \r\n  â€œdishonestyâ€ so as to bring any conviction for such crime within the scope of \r\n  Floridaâ€™s version of Rule 609(a)(2)); Ruttley v. State, 746 So. 2d 872 \r\n  (Miss. Ct. App. 1998) (pointing out that robbery conviction may be introduced \r\n  pursuant to M.R.E. 609(a)(2) as crime of â€œdishonestyâ€ for purpose of impeaching \r\n  defendantâ€™s credibility as witness in his own behalf); State v. Day, \r\n  617 P.2d 142 (N.M. 1980) (noting cross-examination of defendant concerning prior \r\n  robbery conviction was permissible under Rule 609 in light of fact that robbery \r\n  involves dishonesty); State v. Sims, 692 P.2d 575, 576 (Or. 1984) (stating \r\n  â€œ[a]rmed robbery is a crime involving dishonesty and is relatively high on the \r\n  credibility scaleâ€; rule is similar to South Carolina rule); Commonwealth \r\n  v. Strong, 563 A.2d 479 (Pa. 1989) (holding Commonwealth may use robbery \r\n  conviction to impeach defendantâ€™s credibility because robbery involves element \r\n  of dishonesty); Commonwealth v. Jackson, 561 A.2d 335 (Pa. Super. Ct. \r\n  1989), affâ€™d, 585 A.2d 1001 (1991) (finding trial court properly allowed \r\n  defendant to be impeached with his prior conviction for robbery because robbery \r\n  is deemed to be a crime that involves dishonesty).\r\nOn the other hand, appellate courts in Minnesota, North Dakota, Utah, \r\n  and West Virginia have determined that a prior conviction for robbery is not \r\n  automatically admissible under Rule 609(a)(2).Â  See, e.g., State \r\n  v. Sims, 526 N.W.2d 201 (Minn. 1994) (stating that prior convictions for \r\n  robbery and aggravated robbery did not directly involve dishonesty and false \r\n  statement, so as to make evidence of such prior offenses automatically admissible \r\n  for impeachment purposes under Rule 609(a)(2); rather, offenses were admissible \r\n  in trial courtâ€™s discretion under Rule 609(a)(1)); State v. Bohe, 447 \r\n  N.W.2d 277 (N.D. 1989) (making clear that conviction for armed robbery does \r\n  not necessarily indicate a propensity toward testimonial dishonesty and is not \r\n  automatically admissible under Rule 609(a)(2)); State v. Lanier, 778 \r\n  P.2d 9 (Utah 1989) (finding defendantâ€™s prior conviction for robbery was not \r\n  crime of â€œdishonesty or false statementâ€ within meaning of Rule 609(a)(2), unless \r\n  it was committed by fraudulent or deceitful means bearing directly on the defendantâ€™s \r\n  likelihood to testify truthfully); State v. Morrell, 803 P.2d 292 (Utah \r\n  Ct. App. 1990) (declaring that crime of robbery does not automatically qualify \r\n  for admission under Rule 609(a)(2)); State v. Rahman, 483 S.E.2d 273 \r\n  (W. Va. 1996) (noting that robbery is not a per se crime of dishonesty; evidence \r\n  that a witness has been convicted of a crime is admissible for purpose of impeachment \r\n  under Rule 609 when underlying facts show crime involved dishonesty or false \r\n  statement).\r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Armed Robbery a Crime of Dishonesty \r\n  Under\r\n  Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE?\r\nThe Court of Appeals, in State v. Shaw, 328 S.C. 454, 492 S.E.2d 402 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997), previously determined shoplifting was a crime of dishonesty \r\n  for purposes of Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE.Â  The Court concluded:\r\n\r\nAlthough we are aware that some federal courts \r\n  have held a defendant may not be impeached on a prior shoplifting conviction, \r\n  we prefer to align ourselves with those state courts that hold shoplifting to \r\n  be a crime that involves dishonesty per se. Common sense tells us that \r\n  anyone who, in violation of the shoplifting statute, takes and carries away \r\n  a storekeeperâ€™s merchandise with intent to deprive the owner of its possession \r\n  without paying for it, or alters or removes a label or price tag in an attempt \r\n  to buy a product at less than its value, or transfers merchandise from its proper \r\n  container for the purpose of depriving a storekeeper of its value acts dishonestly.Â  \r\n  We, therefore, hold a prior conviction for shoplifting can be used to impeach \r\n  a witness under Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE.Â  See Websterâ€™s New Universal \r\n  Unabridged Dictionary 525 (Deluxe 2d ed. 1983) (defining the word â€œdishonestyâ€ \r\n  to mean â€œdeceiving, stealing, etc.â€).\r\n\r\nId. at 456-57, 492 S.E.2d at 403-04 (footnotes omitted).\r\nArmed robbery occurs when a person commits robbery either while armed with \r\n  a deadly weapon or while the person was alleging he was armed and was using \r\n  a representation of a deadly weapon.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330 (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n  Our statutory scheme provides that the crime of robbery is defined by the common \r\n  law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-325 (Supp. 2001).Â  Robbery is defined \r\n  as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property \r\n  of any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by \r\n  putting such person in fear.Â  State v. Parker, 351 S.C. 567, 571 S.E.2d \r\n  288 (2002); Joseph v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 571 S.E.2d 280 (2002).Â  â€œThe \r\n  common-law offense of robbery is essentially the commission of larceny with \r\n  force.â€Â  State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 49, 260 S.E.2d 719, 720 (1979).Â  \r\n  Larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of another against \r\n  the ownerâ€™s will or without his consent.Â  See Broom v. State, \r\n  351 S.C. 219, 569 S.E.2d 336 (2002); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, \r\n  562 S.E.2d 320 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  To convict of larceny, the State must show \r\n  the defendant took the property and carried it away with intent to steal it.Â  \r\n  State v. Posey, 88 S.C. 313, 70 S.E. 612 (1911).Â  â€œIn common parlance[,] \r\n  larceny is just plain stealing.â€Â  State v. Roof, 196 S.C. 204, 209, 12 \r\n  S.E.2d 705, 707 (1941); see also Gill v. Ruggles, 95 S.C. 90, \r\n  78 S.E. 536 (1913) (noting that â€œstealingâ€ is the popular word for the technical \r\n  word â€œlarcenyâ€).Â Â  \r\nWe find the same logic by which we recognized shoplifting to be a \r\n  crime of dishonesty applies to armed robbery.Â  It is the larcenous element of \r\n  taking property of another which makes the action dishonest.Â  Larceny is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of armed robbery.Â  See State v. Parker, 351 S.C. at 570-71, \r\n  571 S.E.2d at 290; State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989).Â  \r\n  Larceny is also implicit within the crime of shoplifting.\r\nTo restrict the application of Rule 609(a)(2) only to those offenses \r\n  which evidence an element of affirmative misstatement or misrepresentation of \r\n  fact would be to ignore the plain meaning of the word â€œdishonesty.â€Â  â€œDishonestyâ€ \r\n  is, by definition, a â€œâ€˜disposition to lie, cheat, or steal.â€™â€Â  United \r\n  States v.

State, 616 A.2d \r\n  1198, 1204 (Del. 1992) (defining the term â€œdishonestyâ€ as â€œthe act or practice \r\n  of lying, deceiving, cheating, stealing or defrauding.â€) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  â€œâ€˜In common human experience[,] acts of deceit, fraud, cheating, or stealing \r\n  . . . are universally regarded as conduct which reflects adversely on a manâ€™s \r\n  honesty and integrity.â€™â€Â  Bogard v. State, 624 So. 2d 1313, 1317 (Miss. \r\n  1993).\r\nWe hold that armed robbery is a crime of dishonesty under Rule 609(a)(2).Â  \r\n  In concluding armed robbery is a crime of dishonesty under Rule 609(a)(2), we \r\n  are in agreement with the majority of other state courts which have considered \r\n  the question of whether robbery is a crime of dishonesty for purposes of Rule \r\n  609(a)(2).\r\nD.Â  No Requirement \r\n  of Probative Value/Prejudicial Impact Analysis\r\nunder Rule 609(a)(2)\r\nHaving concluded that armed robbery is a crime of dishonesty under Rule 609(a)(2), \r\n  SCRE, we consider whether there is any requirement for the court to engage in \r\n  a probative value/prejudicial impact analysis.Â  Rule 609(a)(1) mandates for \r\n  non-â€œdishonesty crimesâ€ that, prior to admission, the court must determine the \r\n  probative value outweighs prejudicial effect to the accused.\r\nRule 609(a)(2), by contrast, clearly limits the discretion of the \r\n  court by mandating the admission of crimes involving dishonesty without any \r\n  determination as to a balancing test.Â  See United States v. Morrow, \r\n  977 F.2d 222 (6th Cir. 1992).\r\nCommentators have stated that â€œ[t]he court must admit evidence that \r\n  a witness has been convicted of a crime that involved dishonesty.â€Â  4 Jack B. \r\n  Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinsteinâ€™s Federal Evidence, Â§ 609.04[1] \r\n  (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed. 2002) (emphasis added).Â  â€œ[M]ost courts held \r\n  that the trial court lacks discretion under Rule 403 to exclude crimes of dishonesty.Â  \r\n  Thus, an opponent has the absolute right to impeach a witness by introducing \r\n  a prior conviction involving dishonesty.â€Â  Id.; See, e.g., \r\n  United States v. Kuecker, 740 F.2d 496 (7th Cir. 1984) (under Federal \r\n  Rule of Evidence 609(a)(2), any prior conviction involving dishonesty is admissible \r\n  to impeach witnessâ€™s credibility without recourse to Rule 403 balancing); see \r\n  also 1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence Â§ 42, at 159-60 \r\n  (John W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999) (â€œCrimes involving â€˜dishonesty or false statement,â€™ \r\n  . . . do not require balancing of probative value against prejudice; under 609(a)(2), \r\n  they are automatically admissible.â€).Â  â€œA conviction that does not involve dishonesty \r\n  . . . may be admitted only after the court has performed the appropriate \r\n  balancing test.â€Â  Weinsteinâ€™s Federal Evidence, Â§ 609.04[1] (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nWe hold Rule 609(a)(2) provides for automatic admission of evidence \r\n  of a prior crime of dishonesty without the balancing of probative value against \r\n  prejudicial effect.Â  This conclusion is supported by the juxtaposition of Rule \r\n  609(a)(1) and Rule 609(a)(2).Â  There is absolutely no language in Rule \r\n  609(a)(2) compelling a balancing test for admission in regard to a crime of \r\n  dishonesty.\r\nWhile crimes punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one \r\n  year require the court to determine whether the probative value of such evidence \r\n  outweighs the prejudicial effect, no such balancing need occur when the crime \r\n  is one involving dishonesty or false statement.Â  These crimes are automatically \r\n  admissible for impeachment purposes because they have the greatest probative \r\n  value on the issue of truth and veracity.\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court did not err in admitting Al-Aminâ€™s \r\n  prior armed robbery conviction without making a determination that the probative \r\n  value outweighed the prejudicial effect.Â  This balancing test was not required \r\n  because armed robbery is a crime of dishonesty within the meaning of Rule 609(a)(2).\r\nIII.Â  Third Party \r\n  Guilt\r\nAl-Amin contends he is entitled to a new trial because the Circuit \r\n  Court erred when it excluded evidence that (1) James Conyers, who lived in the \r\n  apartment with the victim, had been evicted; and (2) DNA testing had excluded \r\n  Al-Amin as a source of DNA obtained from a sperm fraction that had been taken \r\n  from the victim.Â  Al-Amin maintains the Circuit Courtâ€™s exclusion of this evidence \r\n  deprived him of his right to present a defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the instant case, Al-Amin sought to admit the proffered testimony of Officer \r\n  Joe Philip Smith.Â  Al-Amin wished to establish that Conyers had been evicted.Â  \r\n  During the proffer, in addition to testifying regarding the living situation \r\n  of Conyers and the victim, Officer Smith stated that the first place the police \r\n  look for a suspect, once a murder victim has been identified, is â€œin her immediate \r\n  family or immediate surroundings.â€Â  The judge excluded this testimony.\r\n&nbsp;Thereafter, Al-Amin sought to present evidence that DNA testing demonstrated \r\n  Al-Amin was excluded as the source of DNA obtained from a sperm fraction on \r\n  a vaginal slide taken from the victim.Â  The court allowed a proffer, but excluded \r\n  the evidence.\r\nThis Court addressed the issue of third party guilt in State v. \r\n  Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Mansfield was charged \r\n  with attempted first degree burglary and sought to introduce evidence that another \r\n  man who lived in the apartment complex where the defendant was found and was \r\n  home that day also matched the victimâ€™s description of the person who committed \r\n  the crime.Â  In upholding the Circuit Courtâ€™s decision to exclude the evidence, \r\n  the Court of Appeals held:\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court has imposed strict limitations on the \r\n  admissibility of third-party guilt.Â  Evidence offered by a defendant as to the \r\n  commission of the crime by another person is limited to facts which are inconsistent \r\n  with the defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  The evidence must raise a reasonable inference \r\n  as to the accusedâ€™s innocence.\r\n\r\nId. at 81, 538 S.E.2d at 265 (citations omitted).Â  The Court concluded:\r\n\r\n[The proffered] evidence casts a mere â€œbare suspicionâ€ on \r\n  [the other man].Â  The fact that [the other man] generally fit the description \r\n  of the perpetrator and lived in the apartment complex does not show his guilt, \r\n  nor is it inconsistent with [the defendantâ€™s] guilt.Â  Because the evidence was \r\n  not inconsistent with [the defendantâ€™s] own guilt, the trial court exercised \r\n  sound discretion in excluding it.\r\n\r\nId. at 85-86, 538 S.E.2d at 267.\r\nThe Mansfield Court discussed State v. Gregory, 198 \r\n  S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941), which articulated:\r\n\r\n[T]he evidence offered by accused as to the commission of \r\n  the crime by another person must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent \r\n  with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption \r\n  as to his own innocence;Â  evidence which can have (no) other effect than to \r\n  cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to \r\n  the commission of the crime by another, is not admissible. . . . But before \r\n  such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with \r\n  it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such \r\n  other person as the guilty party.Â  Remote acts, disconnected and outside the \r\n  crime itself, cannot be separately proved for such a purpose.Â  An orderly and \r\n  unbiased judicial inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant on trial \r\n  does not contemplate that such defendant be permitted, by way of defense, to \r\n  indulge in conjectural inferences that some other person might have committed \r\n  the offense for which he is on trial, or by fanciful analogy to say to the jury \r\n  that someone other than he is more probably guilty.\r\n\r\nId. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d at 534-35 (internal quotations and citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nHere, the trial judge did not err in excluding this testimony.Â  There is no \r\n  evidence tying Conyers to the murder other than the fact that he and the victim \r\n  were roommates.Â  Testimony regarding whether Conyers had been evicted was not \r\n  relevant.Â  Furthermore, information as to where the police generally begin looking \r\n  for perpetrators in a homicide investigation is irrelevant to Al-Aminâ€™s guilt \r\n  and, at most, would merely cast a â€œbare suspicionâ€ upon Conyers.Â  The evidence \r\n  Al-Amin sought to admit does not show Conyersâ€™s guilt nor is it inconsistent \r\n  with Al-Aminâ€™s culpability and presents an even weaker case for admissibility \r\n  than the evidence in Mansfield.Â  Moreover, by Al-Aminâ€™s own admission, \r\n  he was in the victimâ€™s immediate surroundings on the date of her death.\r\nAdditionally, the refusal by the court to admit negative DNA evidence concerning \r\n  sperm in the victim and the fact that the sperm did not belong to Al-Amin was \r\n  proper.Â  There was no assertion that the victim was sexually assaulted by the \r\n  perpetrator.Â  In his brief, Al-Amin alleges the fact that a crack pipe was recovered \r\n  from the victimâ€™s crotch area â€œmade it reasonable to infer that there was a \r\n  sexual component to the crimeâ€ and that evidence excluding Al-Amin as the sperm \r\n  donor was relevant and reasonably indicated his innocence.Â  This assertion is \r\n  implausible and conjectural.\r\nThe evidence offered by Al-Amin was not inconsistent with his own \r\n  guilt, nor did it raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to Al-Aminâ€™s \r\n  innocence.Â  The trial judge exercised sound discretion in excluding it.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, Al-Aminâ€™s conviction \r\n  is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3603","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of John Foley Kennedy","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3603","description":"John Foley Kennedy appeals the circuit court's determination that he is a sexually violent predator.","date":"2003-03-03","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn re Kennedy\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-indent:1.0in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyText2\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBlockText\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of John Foley Kennedy,\r\n        Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Laurens County\r\nJohn W.

Shupe, Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Heckler, all of Columbia; \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  The State petitioned to have \r\n  John Foley Kennedy committed to the Department of Mental Health (DMH) as a sexually \r\n  violent predator under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100 (Supp. 2001).Â  After a bench \r\n  trial, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that Kennedy was a sexually \r\n  violent predator and committed him to the DMH.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 1991, Kennedy pleaded guilty to committing \r\n  a lewd act on a child and received a suspended sentence.Â  The sentence was later \r\n  revoked.Â  In 1996, he entered two Alford pleas to committing a lewd act \r\n  on a child under the age of fourteen.Â  The first victim was a young girl, approximately \r\n  two years of age.Â  The second victim was a boy about one year old.Â  He was sentenced \r\n  to six years incarceration suspended upon service of five years probation.Â  \r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1999, the State \r\n  petitioned for a finding of probable cause that Kennedy was a sexually violent \r\n  predator.Â  On July 26, 1999, the judge entered an order finding probable cause \r\n  existed and ordered that Kennedy be taken into custody.Â  After a probable cause \r\n  hearing, Kennedy was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.Â  Kennedy was \r\n  evaluated by the Stateâ€™s expert witness, Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, in August \r\n  1999, and by his own expert witness, Dr. Harold Morgan, in November 1999.Â  A \r\n  non-jury trial was held on May 23, 2000, at which Kennedy was found to be a \r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  He was committed to the DMH for his long-term control, \r\n  care, and treatment.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without \r\n  a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal \r\n  unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976).Â  Thus, this court must affirm if there is any evidence to support \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s findings.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n Kennedy contends the trial court erred \r\n  in committing him to the DMH because the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt he was a sexually violent predator and could not control his behavior. [1] Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Stateâ€™s Proof That Kennedy Was a Sexually Violent Predator \r\n\r\n&nbsp;Kennedy argues there was ample evidence \r\n  to support a finding that he was not a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2000) provides that a sexually violent predator is \r\n  a person who:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  has been convicted of a sexually violentÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  offense; and \r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person \r\n  likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility \r\n  for long-term control, care, and treatment.\r\n\r\nAddressing the first prong of the statute, it is clear \r\n  that Kennedyâ€™s convictions for committing a lewd act on a child under the age \r\n  of fourteen is a sexually violent offense as enumerated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  44-48-30(2)(k) (Supp. 2002).Â  Therefore, we must look at the second prong to \r\n  determine if Kennedy suffers from a mental abnormality [2]  that would make him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.Â  \r\n\r\nIn support of his argument, Kennedy asserts that \r\n  because he passed the Penal Plethysmography (PPG) test, which is used to test \r\n  sexual arousal to children,Â  this was the best evidence that he would not re-offend.Â  \r\n  He also contends that he sought treatment while in prison and voluntarily inquired \r\n  of his probation officer about possible treatment programs.Â  He further notes \r\n  that he was released for a period of approximately seven months without incident \r\n  before he was arrested pursuant to the Act, and that he had consistently and \r\n  successfully abided by the terms of his probation.\r\nHowever, there is evidence to support \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Kennedy was a sexually \r\n  violent predator.Â  During trial, the State offered the testimony of Dr. Donna \r\n  Schwartz-Watts regarding Kennedyâ€™s psychiatric illness and possible treatments.Â  \r\n  She found that Kennedy suffered from pedophilia, frotteurism \r\n  [3] , and anxiety disorder.Â  She testified that pedophilia is a lifelong \r\n  illness, and most significant to our analysis, she stated that Kennedy had the \r\n  propensity to commit future acts on children because of the illness.Â  \r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts also testified that due to Kennedyâ€™s \r\n  continuing denial of the events, he is less likely to pursue outpatient treatment \r\n  and therefore needs the supervision of inpatient treatment.Â  She further testified \r\n  that the only comprehensive program in the state is the inpatient program through \r\n  the DMH.Â  Dr. Harold Morgan, Kennedyâ€™s court-appointed psychiatrist, also opined \r\n  that Kennedy would benefit from some type of treatment.Â  Dr. Morgan stated that \r\n  he knew of outpatient treatment in Greenville, but did not know of specific \r\n  programs anywhere else.Â  He also agreed that there would be no guarantee that \r\n  Kennedy would not reoffend while in an outpatient program.Â  \r\nWhile there may be some evidence \r\n  supporting Kennedyâ€™s claim that he is not a sexually violent predator, including \r\n  a normal PPGÂ  test result, there is more than enough evidence to support the \r\n  decision reached by the trial court.Â  Moreover, our supreme court has previously \r\n  noted that such arguments concerning evidence that an individual was not a sexually \r\n  violent predator go to the weight of the evidence and not its sufficiency.Â  \r\n  In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 647, 550 S.E.2d 311, 315 (2001), cert. \r\n  denied by Matthews v. South Carolina, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S. Ct. 1928 \r\n  (May 13, 2002).Â  Therefore, in light of our limited scope of review, we find \r\n  the trial court did not err in concluding Kennedy was a sexually violent predator \r\n  and in committing him to the DMH for treatment.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Proof That Kennedy Could Not Control His Behavior\r\nKennedy next argues the trial court erred in finding \r\n  he was a sexually violent predator because the State failed to prove beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt that he could not control his behavior.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s Sexually Violent Predator Act \r\n  is modeled on the Kansas Act.Â  Matthews, 345 S.C. at 649, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  at 316.Â  Kennedy cites a Kansas case, In the Matter of the Treatment and \r\n  Care of Michael T. Crane, 7 P.3d 285 (2000), in support of his argument \r\n  that it was incumbent upon the State to prove that he could not control his \r\n  behavior.Â  This case, however, has been vacated by the United States Supreme \r\n  Court in Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002).Â  In Crane, the \r\n  Supreme Court found that the Kansas statute â€œset forth no requirement of total \r\n  or complete lack of control.â€Â  534 U.S. at 411.Â  It further noted that â€œthe \r\n  most severely ill people--even those commonly termed â€˜psychopathsâ€™--retain some \r\n  ability to control their behavior.â€Â  Id. at 412.Â  However, the Court \r\n  further found that the federal constitution does not allow civil commitment \r\n  under the Act without any lack of control determination.Â  Id., \r\n  at 414.Â  \r\nOur supreme court has previously addressed the \r\n  holding in Crane in In re Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d \r\n  338 (2002).Â  It recognized that â€œ[t]he Crane Court failed to provide \r\n  an exact threshold between where control ends and where a lack of control begins. \r\n  . . . â€˜[I]t is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty \r\n  in controlling behavior.â€™â€Â  Id., 351 S.C. at 142, 568 S.E.2d at 348 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  It further found that: \r\n\r\nInherent within the mental abnormality prong of the Act is \r\n  a lack of control determination, i.e. the individual can only be committed \r\n  if he suffers from a mental illness which he cannot sufficiently control without \r\n  the structure and care provided by a mental health facility, rendering him likely \r\n  to commit a dangerous act.Â  \r\n\r\nId., 351 S.C. at 144, 568 S.E.2d at 349.Â  Thus, Crane \r\n  does not mandate a separate and specific lack of control determination, â€œonly \r\n  that a court must determine the individual lacks control while looking at the \r\n  totality of the evidence.â€Â  Id., 351 S.C. at 143, 568 S.E.2d at 348 (citing \r\n  Crane, 534 U.S. at 413). Therefore, because Kennedy suffered from pedophilia, \r\n  â€œa mental abnormality that critically involves what a lay person might describe \r\n  as a lack of control,â€ we find this is inherent evidence that Kennedy suffered \r\n  from an inability to control his own behavior.Â  Crane, 534 U.S. at 414 \r\n  (citing DSM-IV 571-572 (listing as a diagnostic criterion for pedophilia that \r\n  an individual have acted on, or been affected by, â€œsexual urgesâ€ toward children)).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s order mandating Kennedyâ€™s \r\n  civil commitment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there was sufficient \r\n  evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that Kennedy was a sexually violent \r\n  predator and could not control his behavior because he suffered from pedophilia.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and ANDERSON, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We note that the State conceded at oral argument that Kennedyâ€™s issues \r\n    were preserved for review by this court pursuant to Norell Forest Products \r\n    v.

Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; Warren Blair \r\n  Giese, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Following a jury trial, Nickie \r\n  White was convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree and kidnapping.Â  \r\n  He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of thirty years for criminal sexual \r\n  conduct and ten years for kidnapping.Â  White appeals, arguing the circuit court \r\n  erred (1) in refusing to charge assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature (ABHAN) and simple assault and battery as lesser-included offenses of \r\n  criminal sexual conduct, and (2) in admitting the testimony of the Stateâ€™s expert \r\n  on post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual abuse.Â  We affirm in part and reverse \r\n  in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victim was employed as a bartender at Club \r\n  Palace in Columbia. During the course of her employment, White was a customer \r\n  of the club.Â  The victim often engaged in conversation with White while she \r\n  was working.Â  On July 31, 1998, White went to Club Palace.Â  When White arrived, \r\n  the victim hugged him and later danced with him during the evening.Â  At some \r\n  point during her shift they left together to get change.Â  The victim and White \r\n  went to a nearby Wal-Mart for change; while there they entered a photo booth \r\n  and took several instant photographs together.Â  Afterwards, the victim agreed \r\n  to go to breakfast with White when she got off work.Â  According to the victim, \r\n  however, she changed her mind about breakfast because she had not made much \r\n  money that night and was tired.Â Â Â Â  Nevertheless, she agreed to drive White \r\n  home to his grandmotherâ€™s house.Â  Upon arriving at the home, White went inside \r\n  to check on his grandmother and then returned to the car where the victim was \r\n  waiting.Â  \r\nAt this point, both the victim and White testified \r\n  to a different version of the events that occurred afterwards.Â  According to \r\n  the victim, White asked her to drive him to a nearby store for a soda.Â  She \r\n  testified that when they returned to the house, White pulled a knife on her \r\n  and demanded that she drive to Earlewood Park.Â  She testified that White sexually \r\n  assaulted and raped her there, but that she was eventually able to seize the \r\n  knife and stab him forcing him to flee.Â  The victim stated that she followed \r\n  him out of the park â€œto make sure that he stayed, he didnâ€™t try and come back \r\n  to get me.â€Â  \r\nAccording to White, the victim suggested they go \r\n  to the park to watch the sun rise.Â  He stated he took a knife for protection \r\n  because of the parkâ€™s location.Â  He testified that the victim made sexual advances \r\n  towards him at the park and they engaged in consensual intercourse.Â  He added \r\n  that she became angry when he wanted to stop, cursed at him, grabbed the knife, \r\n  and then stabbed him.Â  He further stated that she followed him out of the woods \r\n  when he turned to leave, and â€œcame behind [him], charging.â€Â  One of the witnesses \r\n  who transported the victim to the hospital after the incident testified that \r\n  when he saw them, the victim was following after White as he walked past him.Â  \r\n\r\nWhite was indicted for kidnapping \r\n  and first degree criminal sexual conduct in connection with the incident. [1] Â  He was found guilty of both charges and was \r\n  sentenced to consecutive sentences of thirty years imprisonment for criminal \r\n  sexual conduct and ten years for kidnapping.Â  White appeals, arguing the circuit \r\n  court erred in failing to charge ABHAN and simple assault and battery as lesser \r\n  included offenses of first degree CSC, and in admitting the testimony of the \r\n  Stateâ€™s expert witness on post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual abuse.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Jury Charge on ABHAN\r\nAt the close of the case, White requested a jury charge on \r\n  assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. \r\n  [2] Â  The circuit court denied the requested charge.Â  White argues this \r\n  was error because the requested charge was supported by the evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nABHAN â€œis an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied \r\n  by circumstances of aggravation.â€Â  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 580, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002) (citation omitted).Â  â€œâ€˜Circumstances of aggravationâ€™ \r\n  is an element of ABHAN.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  â€œCircumstances of \r\n  aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, \r\n  infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical \r\n  conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction \r\n  of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, \r\n  and resistance to lawful authority.â€Â  Id. at 105-106, 564 S.E.2d at 580-581.\r\nOur supreme court has recently held that ABHAN is a \r\n  lesser- included offense of first degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  Primus, \r\n  349 S.C. at 581, 564 S.E.2d at 106.Â  A â€œtrial judge must charge a lesser included \r\n  offense if there is any evidence from which it can be inferred that the defendant \r\n  committed the lesser included of the crime charged.â€Â  State v. Heyward, \r\n  350 S.C. 153, 157, 564 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied \r\n  Nov. 6, 2002, (citing State v. Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 32, 340 S.E.2d 784, \r\n  785 (1986)).Â  â€œTo warrant eliminating a lesser included offense charge, it must \r\n  â€˜very clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoeverâ€™ tending to \r\n  reduce the crime from the greater offense to the lesser.â€Â  Heyward, 350 \r\n  S.C. at 158, 564 S.E.2d at 382 (citation omitted) (emphasis added in the original).Â  \r\n\r\nIn both Heyward and Drafts, the issue \r\n  was whether the trial judge erred in failing to issue an ABHAN charge where \r\n  the defendant was on trial for assault with intent to commit criminal sexual \r\n  conduct in the first degree.Â  Id. at 157, 564 S.E.2d at 381.Â  In both \r\n  cases, there was evidence from which a jury could find the defendant was guilty \r\n  of ABHAN, and thus the trial judge erred in not charging ABHAN.Â  Heyward, \r\n  350 S.C. at 158, 564 S.E.2d at 382; Drafts, 288 S.C. at 34, 340 S.E.2d \r\n  at 786.Â  In Drafts, the defendant allegedly held the victim at knifepoint \r\n  and asked her to â€œgive him a little bitâ€ and perform oral sex.Â  The defendant, \r\n  however, claimed that â€œhe did not want to do anythingâ€ with the victim, but \r\n  admitted taking indecent liberties with her.Â  Our supreme court found that if \r\n  the jury had believed the defendant â€œdid not want to do anything with the victim, \r\n  they could have concluded there was no sexual battery and found him guilty of \r\n  ABHAN.â€Â  Drafts, 288 S.C. at 34, 340 S.E.2d at 786.Â  Similarly, in Heyward, \r\n  after beating the victim about the head and choking her, the defendant allegedly \r\n  forced the victim into her car and told her he was taking her for a ride â€œto \r\n  get some of [her] good stuff.â€Â  Heyward, 350 S.C. at 156, 340 S.E.2d \r\n  at 381.Â  This court found it could not â€œisolate Heywardâ€™s single statement concerning \r\n  Victimâ€™s â€˜good stuffâ€™ to the exclusion of the evidence that Heyward was guilty \r\n  only of ABHAN.â€Â  Id. at 158, 340 S.E.2d at 382.Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the victim testified that prior \r\n  to the commission of the alleged CSC, White dragged her into the woods by her \r\n  arms while holding the knife and then punched her in her eye.Â  She further stated \r\n  that during the alleged CSC, White â€œgot mad and slapped [her].â€Â Â Â  Thus, \r\n  under the victimâ€™s version of events, a charge for ABHAN would have been proper \r\n  because it was contemporaneous with the alleged CSC.Â  \r\nWhite testified that he and the victim had consensual \r\n  sexual intercourse.Â  Under his version of events, because the sex was consensual, \r\n  no battery could have occurred until after he and the victim had sex.Â  White \r\n  admitted that he struck the victim in self-defense when she became angry with \r\n  him for withdrawing from sex.Â  Thus, because there was evidence from which the \r\n  jury could have believed that the sex was consensual, and that no battery occurred \r\n  until after the parties engaged in intercourse, we find White was entitled to \r\n  an ABHAN charge.Â  Accordingly, we reverse Whiteâ€™s first degree CSC conviction \r\n  and remand this issue to the circuit court for a new trial.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJury Charge on Simple Assault \r\n   \r\nWhite also asserts the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to charge simple assault and battery as a lesser included offense of CSC.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œ[S]imple assault and battery is an unlawful act of \r\n  violent injury to another, unaccompanied by any circumstances of aggravation.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 21, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999) \r\n  (quoting State v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 285-86, 478 S.E.2d 871, 877 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  Among other things, an example of a circumstance of aggravation \r\n  includes a difference in the sexes.Â  Id.Â  In this case, we find no error \r\n  in the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to charge simple assault and battery.Â  Here, the \r\n  evidence shows that the parties were of opposite sexes, an aggravating circumstance \r\n  of ABHAN.Â  Therefore, a circumstance of aggravation existed in this factual \r\n  scenario to take this case outside of the realm of simple assault and battery.\r\nIII.Â  Testimony of Stateâ€™s Expert Witness\r\nWhite next argues the circuit court erred in admitting \r\n  the testimony of the Stateâ€™s expert witness, Coles Badger, on post-traumatic \r\n  stress disorder and sexual abuse because it was more prejudicial than probative.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs an initial matter, we \r\n  address the preservation of this issue for our review.Â  During a motion in \r\n  limine, Whiteâ€™s attorney objected to Badgerâ€™s testimony, arguing its prejudicial \r\n  effect would greatly outweigh its probative value.Â  After arguments on this \r\n  issue, the circuit court stated it would â€œtake a look at the cases [on the issue] \r\n  and then [make] a determination before [court] started back.â€Â  However, before \r\n  there was a ruling on the admissibility of Badgerâ€™s testimony, another witness \r\n  testified.Â  Badger then testified in camera, and Whiteâ€™s attorney again \r\n  objected to her testimony, this time based on the ground that she was not qualified.Â  \r\n  After hearing arguments from both sides, the circuit court ruled Badger could \r\n  be admitted as an expert in the fields of post-traumatic stress disorder and \r\n  sexual abuse.Â  The circuit court also noted for the record that it â€œmade an \r\n  analysis under Rule 403 and . . . deemed that the testimony would be appropriate.â€Â  \r\n  Thus, we find the circuit court made a final ruling on Whiteâ€™s in limine \r\n  Rule 403 objection.Â  Therefore, this issue is properly preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  See State v. Smith, 337 S.C. 27, 32, 522 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1999) \r\n  (â€œA ruling in limine is not final; unless an objection is made at the \r\n  time the evidence is offered and a final ruling is procured, the issue is not \r\n  preserved for review.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nAt trial, Badger testified that in her opinion, the victimâ€™s symptoms were consistent \r\n  with someone who had suffered trauma and had been raped.Â  Badger explained that \r\n  the victim â€œdescribed symptoms of being unable to sleep and of having nightmares, \r\n  having difficulty concentrating, being very fearful, unable to trust others.â€Â  \r\n  She further testified about the victimâ€™s â€œjumpiness,â€ â€œanger,â€ â€œshame,â€ â€œcrying,â€ \r\n  and â€œanxiety.â€Â  \r\nWhite argues Badgerâ€™s testimony \r\n  was more prejudicial than probative because it was outside the scope of the \r\n  exception for rape trauma evidence as carved out by State v. Schumpert, \r\n  312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993), and its progeny.Â  White contends this case \r\n  is distinguishable from those cases which allow expert rape trauma testimony \r\n  because the victim in this case was an adult.Â  White argues the victim was neither \r\n  a person whose ability to discuss the facts and circumstances of the case would \r\n  prevent her from coming forward for fear of reprisal nor someone whose age, \r\n  inexperience, and impressionability might make it difficult to accurately remember \r\n  the events because of an immaturity or lack of understanding with the judicial \r\n  process.Â  More succinctly stated, White claims the reasons for the exception \r\n  in Schumpert simply do not exist in this case.Â  \r\nWe could discern no case \r\n  in this state which has held that the Schumpert exception applies only \r\n  to child victims.Â  Neither Schumpert nor any of its progeny limits the \r\n  use of rape trauma evidence to cases involving child sexual assault victims.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we decline to limit the use of this testimony to cases where the \r\n  sexual conduct involves a minor.\r\nMoreover, we find this testimony was cumulative to the unchallenged testimony \r\n  of Dr. Alfred Jenkins, Nurse Bridgette Deguzman, and Officer Bob Benson.Â  Dr. \r\n  Jenkins, who observed the victim in the emergency room after the incident, testified \r\n  that at that time she was â€œquite tearful,â€ â€œagitated,â€ and â€œwithdrawn.â€Â  He \r\n  stated in his opinion, she had suffered trauma.Â  Nurse Deguzman, who also saw \r\n  the victim in the emergency room after the incident, stated that when she first \r\n  saw her, the victim â€œwas upset and she appeared frightened, disheveled; she \r\n  was crying, visibly shaken.â€Â  Officer Benson testified that when the victim \r\n  wrote her statement approximately two days after the incident, she would write \r\n  a few pages and then get upset.Â  \r\nGiven the testimony of these witnesses, any error in admitting Badgerâ€™s testimony \r\n  was harmless.Â  See Schumpert, 312 S.C. at 507, 435 S.E.2d at 862 \r\n  (stating that any error in the admission of cumulative evidence is harmless); \r\n  State v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 499, 381 S.E.2d 732, 733 (1989) (â€œThe \r\n  admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to \r\n  other evidence.â€).\r\nFinally, White argues that the prejudicial effect of Badgerâ€™s testimony, that \r\n  she believed the victimâ€™s account of events, far outweighed its probative value \r\n  and improperly bolstered the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  Essentially, White argues \r\n  that this testimony â€œtipped the scalesâ€ in the victimâ€™s favor, and therefore \r\n  White should be entitled to a new trial on the kidnapping charge as well.Â  \r\n  Although this testimony may have exceeded the proper boundaries of expert \r\n  testimony regarding post-traumatic stress and sexual abuse under State v. \r\n  Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989) and its progeny, we find this \r\n  issue is not preserved for our review as Whiteâ€™s attorney failed to object to \r\n  this testimony when it was elicited during trial.Â  See State v. Peay, \r\n  321 S.C. 405, 413, 468 S.E.2d 669, 674 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding a contemporaneous \r\n  objection and ruling at trial is required to properly preserve an error for \r\n  appellate review).Â  Thus, we decline to address this issue on appeal and necessarily \r\n  hold that Whiteâ€™s kidnapping conviction is affirmed.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing reasons, we find White was entitled \r\n  to an ABHAN charge and accordingly, we reverse Whiteâ€™s CSC conviction and remand \r\n  that issue to the circuit court for a new trial consistent with this opinion.Â \r\nWe further find the circuit court did not err in failing to charge simple assault \r\n  and battery and in admitting the testimony of the Stateâ€™s expert witness; therefore, \r\n  we affirm Whiteâ€™s kidnapping conviction.

Fred Kuhn, of Beaufort; for Appellant.\r\nEdwin W. Rowland, of Hilton Head Island; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Henry K. Purdy, III (the father) \r\n  appeals from an order of the family court refusing to terminate his child support \r\n  obligation to Catherine A. Purdy (the mother) before the partiesâ€™ child reached \r\n  the age of majority.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe parties were formerly married.Â  \r\n  Their youngest child, Ryan, who was born March 15, 1984, is the subject of this \r\n  action.Â  The mother and father were divorced by order of the family court dated \r\n  October 30, 1995.Â  Pursuant to the order, the parties were awarded joint custody \r\n  of Ryan, with the mother designated the primary custodial parent.Â  The family \r\n  court set the fatherâ€™s monthly child support at $1,500 for Ryan and her older \r\n  sister.Â  At the time of the instant action, the fatherâ€™s child support obligation \r\n  was $750 per month, inasmuch as Ryanâ€™s sister had already reached majority.\r\nThe father instituted this action against the mother \r\n  on February 28, 2001 seeking an order declaring Ryan emancipated and terminating \r\n  his child support obligation.Â  The mother answered, denying that Ryan was emancipated.\r\nThe family court held the final hearing \r\n  on the matter on May 14, 2001, at which time Ryan was still a minor.Â  Ryan testified \r\n  she quit school in late 2000 when she was in the eleventh grade.Â  Shortly thereafter, \r\n  on February 28, 2001, she moved out of the motherâ€™s home.Â  At the time of trial, \r\n  Ryan was living with her boyfriend and a roommate, and was pregnant with her \r\n  boyfriendâ€™s child.Â  Both she and her boyfriend were employed.Â  Ryan had been \r\n  employed for approximately two months by a hotel-resort baby-sitting service \r\n  on a part-time basis, working three or four days per week.Â  Ryan testified she \r\n  and her boyfriend paid their own rent, food and utility expenses without assistance \r\n  from the mother, and she intended to remain with her boyfriend after the birth \r\n  of their child.\r\nThe mother testified she wanted \r\n  what was best for her daughter.Â  While agreeing her daughter was â€œout on her \r\n  ownâ€ at that time, she noted Ryanâ€™s future was uncertain inasmuch as she was \r\n  still a minor and unmarried.Â  She noted she was concerned the boyfriend could \r\n  leave her daughter and she would then be responsible for both her daughter and \r\n  her grandchild.Â  She stated she did not want the child support money for herself, \r\n  and would turn any further child support payments over to Ryan.\r\nBy order dated May 25, 2001, the \r\n  family court declined to declare Ryan emancipated and ordered the father to \r\n  continue paying child support until Ryan became emancipated by reaching the \r\n  age of eighteen or getting married. \r\n  [1] Â  In reaching this determination, the trial court reasoned that there \r\n  was no credible evidence establishing Ryan was able to sustain herself.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992).Â  We are not, however, required to disregard the findings of \r\n  the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  \r\n  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001);Â  Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 537, 532 S.E.2d 19, 22 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGenerally, under South Carolina law, \r\n  a parentâ€™s obligation to pay child support extends until the child reaches majority, \r\n  becomes self-supporting, or marries, then ends by operation of law.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(17) (Supp. 2002) (granting family court jurisdiction \r\n  â€œ[t]o make all orders for support run until further order of the court, except \r\n  that orders for child support run until the child is eighteen years of age or \r\n  until the child is married or becomes self-supporting, as determined by the \r\n  court, whichever occurs first . . . .â€).Â  â€œEmancipation of a minor child is \r\n  effected primarily by agreement of the parent, although acts of the child are \r\n  to be considered.â€Â  Timmerman v. Brown, 268 S.C. 303, 305, 233 S.E.2d \r\n  106, 107 (1977).Â  â€œWhether a child has been emancipated depends on the facts \r\n  and circumstances of each case.â€Â  Id.\r\nAt first glance, the acts of Ryan strongly suggest \r\n  emancipation, but when considered in light of other facts and circumstances, \r\n  we agree with the findings of the trial judge and defer to his wisdom and judgment \r\n  as to the lack of evidence establishing Ryanâ€™s full emancipation at the time \r\n  this action was commenced.Â  Although Ryan had moved out of the motherâ€™s home \r\n  and was residing with her boyfriend, it is clear from the record that the mother, \r\n  who is the primary custodial parent, objected to the move and clearly did not \r\n  agree that her daughter should be emancipated.Â  The mother testified the father \r\n  gave Ryan â€œmoney behind [the motherâ€™s] backâ€ in order to allow Ryan to move \r\n  out of her home.Â  The father himself testified he gave Ryan $700 for the â€œdown \r\n  paymentâ€ on her apartment, and took Ryan and her boyfriend to a store, spending \r\n  over $500 for them to â€œget whatever they needed for their apartment.â€ [2] Â  Further, Ryan and her boyfriend were not married \r\n  and, therefore, the boyfriend was not legally obligated to contribute to Ryanâ€™s \r\n  support.Â  While Ryan was employed on a part-time basis, there was no evidence \r\n  that she could have supported herself in the event her relationship with her \r\n  boyfriend deteriorated.Â  Additionally, the mother testified she had continued \r\n  to financially support her daughter, giving her cash, taking her out for meals, \r\n  paying for repairs to Ryanâ€™s car, and paying $100 toward Ryanâ€™s medical bill \r\n  until she could obtain reimbursement for the bill from Ryanâ€™s father.Â  Thus, \r\n  it appears Ryan, even with the help of her boyfriend, was not truly self-supporting.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUnder the particular facts and circumstances of this case, \r\n  especially the fact that the primary custodial parent did not acquiesce in the \r\n  minorâ€™s move from the home but the supporting parent both consented and encouraged \r\n  the move with financial aide, we discern no error in the family courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    court further ordered that the support â€œshall be paid to the mother who in \r\n    turn will write a check to the child, Ryan Purdy.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]\r\n   It \r\n    should be noted the father filed this action on the same day the daughter \r\n    moved out of the motherâ€™s home. Â It appears the father is, in effect, attempting \r\n    to eliminate his monthly support obligation by financially enabling his daughter \r\n    to move out of the home of her mother against the motherâ€™s wishes.Â  While \r\n    we agree with the fatherâ€™s assertion that the provision of money to the child \r\n    under these circumstances tends to reward the minor for â€œquitting school, \r\n    moving in with her boyfriend, [and] getting pregnant,â€ the father is, in part, \r\n    the author of this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3606","title":"Doe v.

By giving birth to a drug-addicted baby, \r\n  Mother violated her probation, so she was incarcerated from November 1998 until \r\n  July 1999.Â  \r\nIn May 1999, the family court, operating under \r\n  the assumption Mother had been released from jail, ordered Mother to pay monetary \r\n  support to Roe. However, a second family court order was issued, dismissing \r\n  Motherâ€™s child support obligation and noting Mother was â€œstill in jail when \r\n  that order was signed.â€Â  The family court also ordered Mother to undergo drug \r\n  and alcohol counseling and attend parenting classes. \r\nWhen Mother was released from jail in July, she \r\n  took very few steps toward regaining custody of Roe.Â  Although she did visit \r\n  Roe, she failed to attend both the recommended outpatient drug treatment program \r\n  and parenting classes. By October, Mother was incarcerated again for her tenth \r\n  shoplifting offense. \r\nOnce Mother was released from prison in January \r\n  2000, she immediately went into a drug addiction recovery program and began \r\n  to turn her life around.Â  Mother completed a six-week parenting class in May \r\n  2000, and in June, after the family court ordered Mother to pay child support \r\n  for Roe, she began making payments.Â  \r\nDoe initiated this action to \r\n  terminate Roeâ€™s parentsâ€™ parental rights on July 21, 2000.Â  Doe also sought \r\n  to adopt Roe.Â  \r\nThe family court terminated \r\n  Motherâ€™s rights based on the child remaining in foster care for fifteen of the \r\n  last twenty-two months and based on grounds of abandonment, failure to rehabilitate, \r\n  failure to support, failure to visit, and diagnosable condition. The \r\n  court also approved Doeâ€™s adoption of Roe, concluding the adoption was in Roeâ€™s \r\n  best interests.Â  Mother appeals, arguing that no ground existed to support the \r\n  termination of her parental rights and that termination was not in Roeâ€™s best \r\n  interests.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, \r\n  the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.Â  South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, \r\n  287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 \r\n  (1999); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747-48 (1982) \r\n  (â€œBefore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents \r\n  in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations \r\n  by at least clear and convincing evidence.â€).\r\nFurthermore, in a TPR case, the appellate court \r\n  has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine the facts according \r\n  to its view of the evidence.Â  Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, \r\n  330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1998).Â  This court may review the record \r\n  and make its own findings whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination.Â  \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 \r\n  S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). However, our broad scope of review does not \r\n  require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial judge \r\n  was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Dorchester \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, \r\n  480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s TPR Statute, â€œ[t]he family \r\n  court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one \r\n  or more of the [listed] grounds and a finding that termination is in the \r\n  best interest of the child.â€ S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-1572 (2001) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  Thus, to terminate parental rights under section 20-7-1572, the family court \r\n  must first find at least one of the statutory grounds set forth in that section.Â  \r\n  If the family court finds that a statutory ground for termination has been proven, \r\n  it must then find that the best interests of the child would be served by termination.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Grounds for Terminating Motherâ€™s Parental Rights\r\nOne ground for terminating a \r\n  parentâ€™s rights under section 20-7-1572 is that the child has lived in foster \r\n  care for fifteen out of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  In this case, Roe \r\n  had been in emergency protective custody and foster care since he was eight \r\n  days old.Â  At the time his foster mother sought to terminate his parentsâ€™ rights, \r\n  Roe was twenty-months old.Â  Mother argues that because twenty-two months had \r\n  not expired, her rights cannot be terminated on this ground.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen construing a statute, courts \r\n  should consider the words of the statute in conjunction with the purpose of \r\n  the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\n  Servs. v. Gamble, 337 S.C. 428, 523 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The stated \r\n  purpose of South Carolinaâ€™s TPR statute â€œis to establish procedures for the \r\n  reasonable and compassionate termination of parental rights where children are \r\n  abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of \r\n  such children and make them eligible for adoption . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  20-7-1560 (1976).Â  Furthermore, case law tells us that TPR statutes must be \r\n  liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing \r\n  minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating \r\n  the parent-child relationship.Â  Joiner ex. rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. \r\n  102, 108, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 519 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nWith the purpose of the TPR statute in mind, we \r\n  find that once a child has been in foster care for fifteen months, whether those \r\n  months are consecutive or within the last twenty-two months, the parental rights \r\n  of that childâ€™s parents may be terminated upon a showing that termination is \r\n  in the childâ€™s best interests.Â  We believe the legislature included the â€œwithin \r\n  the most recent twenty-two monthsâ€ language in order to account for children \r\n  who bounce between a foster home and their parentsâ€™ home.Â  The language indicates \r\n  that children need not have been in foster care for fifteen consecutive months \r\n  before their parentsâ€™ rights can be terminated, but rather, a ground for termination \r\n  exists once a child has languished in foster care for any fifteen months \r\n  within the most recent twenty-two-month period.Â Â  \r\nHere, the fact that Roe was in foster care for \r\n  the last twenty months is undisputed.Â  Thus, we find the trial court did not \r\n  err in finding a statutory ground supporting the termination of Motherâ€™s parental \r\n  rights.\r\nII.Â  Roeâ€™s Best Interests\r\nHaving found one ground on which \r\n  the family court properly terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights, we need only \r\n  determine that termination of Motherâ€™s rights is in Roeâ€™s best interests to \r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s termination.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-1572.Â Â  Although \r\n  we applaud Mother for completing drug rehabilitation and for turning her life \r\n  around, we believe that Roeâ€™s interests would be best served by terminating \r\n  Motherâ€™s rights.Â  See e.g., South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. \r\n  Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 258-259, 519 S.E.2d 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œThe \r\n  interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interests and the parental \r\n  rights conflict.â€).\r\n From the time that Roe was released \r\n  from the hospital, he resided with Doe, and at the time of the hearing, he was \r\n  just under twenty-nine months old.Â  DSS professionals testified about the bonds \r\n  he formed with Doe, as well as the quality of home-life provided by Doe.Â  A \r\n  behavioral pediatrician testified about the detrimental effect separating Roe \r\n  and Doe would have on Roe.Â  Additionally, Doe testified about her relationship \r\n  with Roe and her ability to provide a nurturing, safe, and comfortable home \r\n  for him.Â  Thus, we find ample evidence in the record to support the family courtâ€™s \r\n  termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the \r\n  decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Mother also gave birth to a drug-addicted baby \r\n    in 1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3607","title":"State v.

thereupon title to the within described unit \r\n  passes to the buyer as of the date of either full cash payment or on the signing \r\n  of said credit instruments even though the actual physical delivery may not \r\n  be made until a later date.Â  \r\n\r\nThe sale was consummated on November \r\n  18, 1999, when the Martinsâ€™ lender, Bank of America, issued two checks totaling \r\n  $40,340 and jointly payable to Jerry Martin and PHS.Â  Pursuant to the terms \r\n  of the purchase agreement, title to the mobile home passed to the Martins at \r\n  this time, albeit subject to First Nationalâ€™s outstanding lien.Â  Jerry Martin \r\n  thereafter endorsed the checks and Marcia Jolly, the bank vice president conducting \r\n  the loan closing, handed them to Parris.Â  Parris told the Martins to â€œgive him \r\n  a couple of days and he would have everything done and [they] could be moved \r\n  in by Thanksgiving,â€ then left the bank.Â  The Martins subsequently accepted \r\n  delivery and took possession of the mobile home on the day before Thanksgiving. \r\n\r\nThe next day, November 19, Parris opened \r\n  a checking account with American Federal Bank and deposited the two checks from \r\n  Bank of America.Â  Thereafter, he withdrew money and wrote checks on the account \r\n  to himself, PHS, and various other payees; he also deposited an additional $7,858.29 \r\n  into the account.Â  \r\nOn December 6, Sherry Martin noticed \r\n  First Nationalâ€™s president, Steve Moss, â€œsnoopingâ€ around the new mobile home.Â  \r\n  Moss approached, knocked on the door, and asked Martin for the trailerâ€™s serial \r\n  number.Â  When Martin told Moss the number was none of his business, Moss replied \r\n  â€œthat he had a right to get the serial number, that he owned the home, and that \r\n  he could repossess it.â€Â  Sherry Martin, upset and crying, called her husband \r\n  and told him what Moss had said.Â  \r\nJerry Martin immediately drove to First \r\n  National and discussed the matter with Thomas Hale, the bankâ€™s Chief Lending \r\n  Officer.Â  Hale explained that First National still had the title to the trailer \r\n  because Parris had not yet paid off the note.Â  When Martin asked if the bank \r\n  could really take possession of the home, he was told it could and â€œprobably \r\n  would.â€Â  Hale then directed Martin to hire a lawyer and go to the police.Â  The \r\n  Martins did so and the police subsequently arrested and charged Parris with \r\n  breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â  Following the arrest, First National \r\n  accelerated the underlying note and seized PHSâ€™s business assets, which it later \r\n  sold at a discount.Â Â  \r\nOn February 24, 2000, a Cherokee County \r\n  grand jury indicted Parris for breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â  Following \r\n  conviction by a jury on July 25, 2000, the trial court sentenced Parris to ten \r\n  years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict \r\n  in a criminal case, a trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State.Â  See State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  402 (2001).Â  In so doing, the court is concerned with the existence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001).Â  \r\n  This Court, in reviewing a refusal to grant the motion, must also view the evidence \r\n  in a light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. McGowan, 347 S.C. 618, \r\n  557 S.E.2d 657 (2001).Â  If the record reveals any direct or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove guilt, then this Court must find the \r\n  trial court acted properly in submitting the case to the jury.Â  See Buckmon, \r\n  347 S.C. at 321, 555 S.E.2d at 404; Lollis, 343 S.C. at 584, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  at 256.Â \r\nOn the other hand, if the State fails \r\n  to present sufficient evidence of the offense, a defendant is entitled to a \r\n  directed verdict from the court.Â  State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 562 S.E.2d \r\n  313 (2002).Â  Hence, â€œwhere the facts of the case, even if proved, do not constitute \r\n  the alleged criminal conduct, a directed verdict must be granted.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Jackson, 338 S.C. 565, 569, 527 S.E.2d 367, 369 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nDiscussion\r\nParris argues \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict because the State failed \r\n  to prove he committed a breach of trust.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAlthough our Legislature has partially \r\n  codified the offense of breach of trust with fraudulent intent, its elements \r\n  remain defined by case law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-230 (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  In essence, the crime is â€œlarceny after trust, which includes all of the elements \r\n  of larceny or in common parlance, stealing, except the unlawful taking in the \r\n  beginning.â€Â  State v. Scott, 330 S.C. 125, 130, 497 S.E.2d 735, 738 (1998) \r\n  (quoting State v. Owings, 205 S.C. 314, 316, 31 S.E.2d 906, 907 (1944)).Â  \r\n  The fact distinguishing larceny from breach of trust is that possession of the \r\n  property is gained by unlawful means in larceny while a breach of trust is accomplished \r\n  by a lawful taking of the property, i.e., through its entrustment to \r\n  one by another.2Â Â  See Scott, 330 S.C. at 130, \r\n  497 S.E.2d at 738. \r\nTo sustain a conviction, the State must \r\n  prove every element of the offense charged.Â  Jackson, 338 S.C. at 569, \r\n  527 S.E.2d at 369.Â  In breach of trust cases, the central question is whether \r\n  the defendant â€œreceived the property in trust,â€ which he later \r\n  violated.Â  Jackson, 338 S.C. at 569, 527 S.E.2d at 369 (quoting State \r\n  v. Shirer, 20 S.C. 392, 408 (1884)).Â  The State, therefore, is required \r\n  to establish the existence of a trust relationship, and in the absence thereof \r\n  the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal.Â  Id. at \r\n  569-570, 527 S.E.2d at 370; see State v. LeMaster, 231 S.C. 321, \r\n  98 S.E.2d 756 (1957).Â Â  \r\nA trust is an arrangement whereby property \r\n  is transferred to another with the intent that it be administered by the trustee \r\n  for the benefit of the transferor or a third party.Â  See Jackson, \r\n  338 S.C. at 570, 527 S.E.2d at 370.Â  As such, it is â€œa fiduciary relationship \r\n  . . . which arises as a result of a manifestation of an intention to create \r\n  it.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Trusts Â§ 2 (1959) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  In most instances a trust relationship is created by the express intent to do \r\n  so, either through words or conduct.Â  Id. at Â§ 24.Â  \r\nThe instant indictment for breach of \r\n  trust alleged Jerry Martin â€œentrustedâ€ Parris with $40,340, which Parris later \r\n  appropriated for his own use.Â  The mere assertion of a trust relationship, however, \r\n  is not proof of its existenceâ€”the State must present evidence tending to prove \r\n  the relationship as an element of the crime.Â  Although the indictment failed \r\n  to specify the nature of the alleged trust, the Stateâ€™s theory of the case, \r\n  acknowledged in its brief, was that Martin â€œentrustedâ€ Parris with the two checks \r\n  in exchange for clear title to the mobile home.Â Â  \r\nIn support of this theory, the State \r\n  offered testimony from Jerry Martin that he â€œexpectedâ€ Bank of America to get \r\n  a clear title to the home when Parris received the checks.Â  The State further \r\n  relied on Sherry Martinâ€™s testimony that she â€œexpectedâ€ Parrisâ€™s statement at \r\n  closing was accurateâ€”that â€œhe would have everything doneâ€ in a couple of days \r\n  so that they could move in by Thanksgiving.Â  According to the State, the Martinsâ€™ \r\n  testimony reflects a â€œcommon understandingâ€ as to when Parris would deliver \r\n  the checks to First National.Â  We disagree.Â  In our view, the proffered evidence, \r\n  ambiguous at best, is insufficient to support a finding of a specific trust \r\n  agreement.Â  See Jackson, 338 S.C. at 571, 527 S.E.2d at 371 (â€œAbsent \r\n  the manifest intent to create a trust, there could be no trust or trust relationship \r\n  to breach.â€); State v. White, 244 S.C. 349, 355, 137 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1964) \r\n  (â€œâ€˜The [S]tate must prove the exact trust which has been breached . . . .â€™â€) \r\n  (quoting State v. Cody, 180 S.C. 417, 424, 186 S.E. 165, 167 (1936)); \r\n  Nickles v. State, 80 S.E.2d 97, 101 (Ga. Ct. App. 1954) (To maintain \r\n  a conviction for larceny after trust, â€œ[t]here must have been a contract [or] \r\n  understanding between the defendant and the victim whereby the former received \r\n  the money from the latter with the distinct agreement and understanding that \r\n  he would apply the same to a particular use for the benefit of the [victim].â€) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAlthough Parris ultimately failed to \r\n  deliver good title, perhaps warranting a claim for breach of contract, nothing \r\n  in the record indicates Martin entrusted him with the purchase price for the \r\n  express purpose of paying off First National to obtain clear title to the trailer.Â  \r\n  To the contrary, the record reveals Martin was unaware title was held by anyone \r\n  other than Parris until December 6, 1999, and thus could not have intended to \r\n  create a trust when Parris received the checks on November 18.3 \r\n  We therefore find the State did not prove a trust relationship in this \r\n  manner.Â  See LeMaster, 231 S.C. at 323-24, 98 S.E.2d at 757 (reversing \r\n  breach of trust convictions where evidence showed builders informed clients \r\n  $2,000 was needed to pay for materials, â€œspecifically some $600 owing to one \r\n  M. D. Martin,â€ and thereafter received the requested funds but failed to pay \r\n  Martin; the court rejected the Stateâ€™s argument that the $2,000 payment â€œwas \r\n  impressed with a special trust,â€ finding no evidence of a trust relationship \r\n  between the builders and clients in part because the Martin bill was not rendered \r\n  to builders until seven days after they were handed the $2,000 check); Teston \r\n  v. State, 390 S.E.2d 437, 439 (Ga. Ct. App. 1990) (finding evidence insufficient \r\n  to establish trust relationship where residential builder allegedly used proceeds \r\n  of construction loan for purposes other than building specific house; court \r\n  stated nothing in loan documents or trial testimony â€œprovided that the funds \r\n  were to be used only forâ€ a particular house).Â  Compare Nickles, \r\n  80 S.E.2d at 101 (reversing conviction for larceny after trust because there \r\n  was no evidence defendant was entrusted with money for a particular purpose) \r\n  with State v. Joy, 851 P.2d 654, 659 (Wash. 1993) (stating embezzlement \r\n  conviction may be valid when an agreement between the parties restricts the \r\n  use of funds to a specific purpose, since the party giving the funds has â€œan \r\n  interest in the . . . application of the money to the purpose for which it was \r\n  entrusted to defendantâ€).4Â Â  \r\n\r\nA trust, however, may arise by implication \r\n  in the absence of an express common intent if there is a fiduciary relationship \r\n  between the parties, because â€œ[a] person in a fiduciary relation to another \r\n  is under a duty to act for the benefit of the other as to matters within the \r\n  scope of the relation.â€Â  Restatement at Â§ 24.5 \r\n  Accordingly, an implied trust may be proved by evidence tending to show the \r\n  partiesâ€™ relationship was fiduciary.Â  \r\nThe ordinary relationship between unaffiliated \r\n  parties is not fiduciary.Â  Restatement at Â§ 2.Â  A fiduciary relationship \r\n  may be created, however, when â€œone reposes special confidence in another so \r\n  that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith \r\n  and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing the confidence.â€Â  SSI \r\n  Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 794 (1990); \r\n  see Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, 293, 368 S.E.2d \r\n  91, 93 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œA â€˜fiduciary relationshipâ€™ is founded on trust and \r\n  confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.â€).Â  \r\n  In general, â€œmere respect for anotherâ€™s judgment or trust in his character is \r\n  usually not sufficient to establish such a relationship.â€Â  Burwell v. S.C. \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 41, 340 S.E.2d 786, 790 (1986).Â  Because a fiduciary \r\n  relationship is based on the trust and confidence reposed by one in the integrity \r\n  and fidelity of another, the relationship between the parties must be more than \r\n  casual.Â  Steele, 295 S.C. at 293, 368 S.E.2d at 93.Â  \r\nTo establish the existence of a fiduciary \r\n  relationship, the facts and circumstances must indicate the party reposing trust \r\n  in another has some foundation for believing the one so entrusted will act not \r\n  in his own behalf but in the interest of the party so reposing.Â  Burwell, \r\n  288 S.C. at 41, 340 S.E.2d at 790.Â  Moreover, the evidence must show the entrusted \r\n  party â€œâ€˜actually accepted or induced the confidence placed in him.â€™â€Â  Brown \r\n  v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 423, 483 S.E.2d 477, 484 (Ct.

Erkmann, 934 S.W. 2d 621, \r\n  630 (Mo. Ct.

Butler, 21 S.C. 353, 356 (1884).Â  \r\n  There is no question but that Parrisâ€™s failure to deliver good title rightfully \r\n  would subject him to an action for breach of contract.Â  However, where the seller \r\n  of an item does not receive the money in question in trust but as payment for \r\n  the item sold, the failure to use the money in a manner beneficial to the buyer \r\n  does not constitute a misappropriation of the buyerâ€™s money.Â  To the contrary, \r\n  the money once given over legally belongs to the seller, and it is elementary \r\n  that â€œone cannot steal or embezzle his own money so as to render himself criminally \r\n  liable therefor.â€Â  Carr, 13 P.2d at 500.Â  As the Missouri Court of Appeals \r\n  has stated:Â  â€œ[A] complaining witness ha[s] no right to invoke criminal process \r\n  on account of the trouble and expense a civil suit might cause him.Â  â€˜The criminal \r\n  courts are neither a collection agency nor a forum for the trial of mere disputes \r\n  over the ownership of property.â€™â€Â  State v. Morris, 699 S.W.2d 33, 36 \r\n  (Mo. Ct. App. 1985) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe evidence presented in this case fails \r\n  to show the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Parris and Jerry Martin.Â  \r\n  Instead, it merely evinces a typical buyer-seller relationship between the parties, \r\n  a relationship not ordinarily fiduciary in nature.Â  Absent the manifest intent \r\n  to create a trust or evidence establishing the existence of a fiduciary relationship \r\n  from which one might be implied, the State presented no proof of a trust that \r\n  was subject to breach.Â  Because the State failed to meet its burden of proving \r\n  the existence of a trust relationship, the trial court erred in failing to direct \r\n  a verdict of acquittal on the charge.Â  See LeMaster, 231 S.C. \r\n  at 324, 98 S.E.2d at 757; Jackson, 338 S.C. at 571-72, 527 S.E.2d at \r\n  371.Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\n GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  1 Â Officially \r\n    known as the â€œManufacturerâ€™s Statement or Certificate of Origin to a Mobile \r\n    Home.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  2Â  South Carolina \r\n    is apparently the only jurisdiction to refer to this offense as breach of \r\n    trust, as our supreme court has noted:Â  \r\n  \r\n  Breach of trust with fraudulent intention, by that especial \r\n    designation, is, so far as we are advised, peculiar to this jurisdiction.Â  \r\n    In other states, the crime, as known to us, is called by different names, \r\n    such as â€œlarceny after trust,â€ â€œlarceny by a bailee,â€ â€œlarceny by false pretenses,â€ \r\n    and very commonly as â€œembezzlement.â€ . . .Â  The general purpose running through \r\n    the statutes creating and defining these crimes is, however, the same; to \r\n    declare as a crime, and usually as one coming within the classification of \r\n    larceny, acts which were formerly not deemed to be larceny at common law, \r\n    because of the fact that possession of property had been obtained through \r\n    the consent of the owner.Â  \r\n  \r\n  State v. McCann, 167 S.C. 393, 400, 166 \r\n    S.E. 411, 414 (1932).Â  Because breach of trust is â€œso similar in its aspects \r\n    to embezzlement, as the latter crime is defined and regarded in most American \r\n    jurisdictions,â€ see id., we will utilize the reasoning employed \r\n    in extra-jurisdictional case law, as did the court in McCann, to support \r\n    our analysis herein.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n  3Â  Both checks \r\n    also contained identical endorsement language:Â  \r\n  \r\n  For value received, by endorsement, the \r\n    payee does warrant good title to and full right to convey a 1999 Legend Mobile \r\n    Home serial # THL2936ABAL.Â  [And at the] time of such sale and application \r\n    of certificate of title thereto, payee has shown a lien in favor of Bank of \r\n    America . . . .Â  \r\n  \r\n  By endorsing the checks, PHS and Jerry Martin recognized \r\n    Bank of Americaâ€™s interest in the mobile home as well as their right and ability \r\n    to convey good title.Â  From this evidence it is apparent neither Martin nor \r\n    Bank of America realized First National had a priority lien on the home; had \r\n    Bank of America been aware of First Nationalâ€™s interest, it likely would have \r\n    written the checks as jointly payable to Parris and First National rather \r\n    than Martin.Â  Although Parris perhaps would be amenable to a charge of selling \r\n    property encumbered by a lien, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-1-30 (1991), \r\n    the evidence supports his innocence of breach of trust.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n  4Â  It is instructive to compare the facts of this case with \r\n    those where the State properly obtained a conviction for breach of trust based \r\n    on a specific trust, to wit:Â  State v. Jordan, 255 S.C. 86, 90-91, \r\n    177 S.E.2d 464, 467 (1970) (upholding stockbrokerâ€™s conviction where he â€œdivert[ed] \r\n    money received in trust for the purchase of [certain] stockâ€ to personal \r\n    use rather than applying it â€œin compliance with the trustâ€) (emphasis added); \r\n    State v.

Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3608\r\nHeard February 11, 2003 â€“ Filed March \r\n  10, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSenior Assistant Appellate Defender Wanda H. Haile, \r\n  of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Oscar Roy Padgett was convicted of failure to stop for \r\n  a blue light.Â  The trial court sentenced him to a three-year term of imprisonment.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 31, 2000 at approximately 8:30 p.m., Officer Gerard Grenier of the \r\n  Ridge Spring Police Department observed a black Mustang parked at the gasoline \r\n  pumps at Kentâ€™s Corner Gas Station on the corner of Highway 23 and Pecan Grove \r\n  Road in Ridge Spring.Â  Officer Grenier recognized the vehicle as the same one \r\n  he had stopped two months earlier for a license tag violation.Â  Padgett was \r\n  driving the vehicle at the time of the prior stop and had explained to Officer \r\n  Grenier that he had purchased it only a few days earlier.\r\nOfficer Grenier testified that, on the night in question, he saw \r\n  Padgett get into the vehicle and decided to follow Padgett to ascertain whether \r\n  he had obtained proper tags for the car.Â  As he â€œsquared offâ€ behind the Mustang \r\n  on Highway 23, Officer Grenier noticed that no license tags were affixed to \r\n  the vehicle and, therefore, activated his patrol carâ€™s blue lights.Â  He stated \r\n  the driver of the vehicle did not stop in response to the blue lights, but rather \r\n  drove slowly for a time, turned onto Trojan Road, accelerated the vehicle, and \r\n  crossed over Highway 1 into Aiken.Â  According to Officer Grenier, he pursued \r\n  Padgett with his siren and blue lights on for about three-fourths of a mile \r\n  outside of Ridge Spring, then terminated the pursuit.Â  He returned to Kentâ€™s \r\n  Corner and questioned the store manager regarding the identity of the person \r\n  driving the black Mustang.Â  The manager informed Officer Grenier that the driver \r\n  was Oscar Padgett.Â  Thereafter, Officer Grenier obtained a warrant for Padgettâ€™s \r\n  arrest.\r\nOfficer Leroy Smith, who was on patrol with Grenier the night of the pursuit, \r\n  verified Officer Grenierâ€™s account of the events.Â  In particular, Officer \r\n  Smith confirmed that Officer Grenier turned on the patrol carâ€™s blue lights \r\n  before Padgett turned onto Trojan Road and, thus, before he left the Ridge Spring \r\n  city limits.\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Padgett moved for a directed \r\n  verdict of acquittal based generally on lack of sufficient evidence.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied the motion.\r\n Padgett declared he was not in Ridge Spring on \r\n  the night of October 31, 2000.Â  He further asserted the transmission on his \r\n  black Mustang was malfunctioning at the time and had been parked in his back \r\n  yard.\r\nAt the close of evidence, Padgett renewed his motion for a directed \r\n  verdict.Â  The trial court again denied the motion.Â  The jury returned \r\n  a guilty verdict.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Walker, \r\n  349 S.C. 49, 562 S.E.2d 313 (2002); State v. Morgan, Â Â Â S.C.Â Â  \r\n  , 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of \r\n  evidence, not its weight. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 \r\n  (2002); State v. McLauren, 349 S.C. 488, 563 S.E.2d 346 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce \r\n  evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, Op. No. 25585 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 27, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at 42); State v. \r\n  McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â  However, if there is any direct \r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove \r\n  the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly submitted \r\n  to the jury.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State \r\n  v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 562 S.E.2d 320 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Jurisdiction \r\n  of Law Enforcement Officer\r\nPadgett asserts the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict \r\n  of acquittal on the charge of failure to stop for a blue light due to the lack \r\n  of jurisdiction on the part of the pursuing officer.Â  Padgett claims the officer \r\n  did not turn on his blue lights until he was â€œoutside the corporate limits according \r\n  to the city map.â€\r\nÂ The polestar of the factual inquiry in this case is a determination \r\n  of when the law enforcement activity began and whether it originated in the \r\n  town limits.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-40 (Supp. 2001) provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement officer jurisdiction when in pursuit of offender; authority, \r\n  rights, privileges, and immunities extended.\r\n  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (A) When the police authorities of a town or city \r\n  are in pursuit of an offender for a violation of a municipal ordinance or statute \r\n  of this State committed within the corporate limits, the authorities may arrest \r\n  the offender, with or without a warrant, at a place within the corporate limits, \r\n  at a place within the county in which the town or city is located, or at a place \r\n  within a radius of three miles of the corporate limits.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPadgett correctly notes that section 17-13-40(A), by its terms, operates \r\n  to limit the jurisdictional authority of town and city police officers to effectuate \r\n  arrests.Â  However, the mere fact that there existed some question as to whether \r\n  the officers in the instant case were operating outside of their jurisdictional \r\n  limitations does not automatically give rise to the propriety of a directed \r\n  verdict on the issue.Â  To the contrary, the facts and circumstances attendant \r\n  to this case present quintessential factual issues regarding the exercise of \r\n  the statutory grant of jurisdiction.\r\nThe officersâ€™ testimony that they initiated the attempted traffic stop inside \r\n  the Ridge Spring city limits, standing alone, constituted sufficient evidence \r\n  to defeat Padgettâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the ground the officers \r\n  lacked jurisdiction to make the stop.Â  Cf. State v. McAteer, 340 \r\n  S.C. 644, 646, 532 S.E.2d 865, 866 (2000) (concluding that â€œ[s]ince the officer \r\n  was outside the municipalityâ€™s city limits when he first observed petitioner, \r\n  he had no police authority to detain him.â€).Â  In ruling on the motion for a \r\n  directed verdict, the trial judge properly limited his inquiry to the existence \r\n  or nonexistence of evidence tending to establish the officers operated within \r\n  the confines of section 17-13-40(A), not the weight of that evidence.Â  See \r\n  State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 319 S.E.2d 335 (1984).Â  The trial court \r\n  did not err in denying Padgettâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\nII.Â  Reasonable Suspicion \r\n  to Warrant Traffic Pursuit\r\nPadgett contends the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion \r\n  for a directed verdict on the charge of failure to stop for a blue light due \r\n  to the lack of reasonable suspicion to warrant the traffic pursuit.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe dissenting opinion in State v. Jihad, 342 S.C. 138, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 79 (Ct. App. 2000) (Anderson, J., dissenting), majority opinion revâ€™d \r\n  on other grounds, 347 S.C. 12, 553 S.E.2d 249 (2001), articulated:\r\n\r\nA police officer may conduct a constitutionally valid traffic stop when the \r\n  officer has a reasonable suspicion that either the vehicle or an occupant is \r\n  subject to seizure for violation of the law.Â  See Delaware v. Prouse, \r\n  440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).Â  As long as an officer reasonably \r\n  suspects the driver is violating â€œany one of the multitude of applicable traffic \r\n  and equipment regulations,â€ the police officer may legally stop the vehicle.Â  \r\n  Id. at 661, 99 S.Ct. at 1400, 59 L.Ed.2d at 672.Â Â  Reasonable suspicion \r\n  is a lesser standard than probable cause and allows an officer to effectuate \r\n  a stop when there is some objective manifestation of criminal activity involving \r\n  the person stopped.Â  See United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, \r\n  109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).Â  Reasonable suspicion exists when an officer \r\n  can identify specific facts that, when taken together with rational inferences \r\n  from those facts, would warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief \r\n  that the detainee has committed (or is committing) a crime.Â  Terry v. Ohio, \r\n  392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).Â  The propriety of a stop must \r\n  be viewed in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances.Â  See \r\n  United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 \r\n  (1981).\r\nNo further inquiry beyond the requirement of reasonable suspicion \r\n  is necessary or warranted.Â  State v. Carlson, 102 Ohio App. 3d 585, 657 \r\n  N.E.2d 591 (1995).Â  Thus, if the specific and articulable facts available to \r\n  an officer indicate a motorist may be committing a criminal act, which includes \r\n  the violation of a traffic law, the officer is justified in making the stop.Â  \r\n  Id. Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has concluded an officerâ€™s \r\n  subjective motive does not invalidate behavior that is objectively justified \r\n  under the Fourth Amendment.Â  See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. \r\n  806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (police officer may stop driver for \r\n  any observed traffic offense even if officerâ€™s motivation for making stop is \r\n  unrelated to observed traffic offense).Â  To satisfy the reasonable suspicion \r\n  standard, the State is not required to prove the suspected motor vehicle violation \r\n  occurred.Â  State v. Williamson, 138 N.J. 302, 650 A.2d 348 (1994); see \r\n  also Marben v. State of Minnesota, Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 294 N.W.2d \r\n  697 (Minn. 1980) (an actual traffic violation need not be detectable; all that \r\n  is required is that the stop be not the product of mere whim, caprice, or idle \r\n  curiosity).\r\n\r\nJihad, 342 S.C. at 147-48, 536 S.E.2d at 83-84.\r\nPursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-3-1240 (Supp. 2002), â€œ[i]t is unlawful \r\n  to operate or drive a motor vehicle with the license plate missing and a person \r\n  who is convicted for violating this section must be punished as provided by \r\n  Section 56-3-2520.â€Â  Officer Grenier testified he noticed that the vehicle he \r\n  pursued on October 31, 2000 did not have a license tag affixed to it.Â  Because \r\n  the mere act of driving a vehicle without a license plate is a chargeable offense, \r\n  Officer Grenierâ€™s observation that the plate was missing from the vehicle constituted \r\n  reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop.Â  The fact that Officer Grenier \r\n  was prompted to check for the missing license plate by his recollection of a \r\n  prior stop of the same vehicle does not negate the existence of reasonable suspicion \r\n  to initiate the stop when he actually observed Padgett committing a traffic \r\n  offense on the night in question.Â  Concomitantly, we find the case was properly \r\n  submitted to the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Padgettâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n CONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3609","title":"State v.

[1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMunicipal Judge Modlaâ€™s Return to Appeal details the testimony presented by \r\n  the arresting officer, Officer Biggers.Â  Officer Biggers testified that he stopped \r\n  Cuccia for speeding.Â  When Cuccia exited his vehicle, Officer Biggers smelled \r\n  alcohol and noticed Cuccia was very unsteady on his feet.Â  Cuccia failed four \r\n  field sobriety tests.Â  Officer Biggers averred that he observed an open beer \r\n  bottle on the floorboard.Â  At the time of Cucciaâ€™s arrest, he was nineteen years \r\n  old.Â Â  \r\nOfficer Pruett performed a Breathalyzer test.Â  The test result indicated Cucciaâ€™s \r\n  alcohol concentration was twenty-one one-hundredths of one percent (.21%), well \r\n  above the two one-hundredths of one percent (.02%) limit for suspending his \r\n  license under S.C. Code Ann. section 56-1-286(A) (Supp. 2002).Â  The level is \r\n  also above ten one-hundredths of one percent (.10%) or more, where it may be \r\n  inferred that the person was under the influence of alcohol under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. section 56-5-2950(b)(3) (Supp. 2002).\r\nAfter the test was performed, a Notice of Suspension form was completed in \r\n  which two boxes were checked as the reason for the suspension of Cucciaâ€™s license.Â  \r\n  The first box was for registering an alcohol concentration of .02% or more while \r\n  under the age of twenty-one, and the second checked box was for registering \r\n  an alcohol concentration of .15% or more.Â  Officer Biggers elected to pursue \r\n  the suspension as a result of Cucciaâ€™s alcohol concentration of .02% or greater \r\n  and the fact he was under the age of twenty-one. \r\nCuccia pled guilty to the open container charge, and the possession of beer \r\n  and speeding charges were nolle prossed.Â  At the trial on the \r\n  DUI charge, Cuccia moved to dismiss the charge contending that it would be double \r\n  jeopardy for him to have his license revoked and to face the charge of DUI.Â  \r\n  The motion to dismiss was denied on the grounds that Cuccia was arrested for \r\n  DUI, but his license was suspended under an administrative or civil sanction \r\n  and was not a criminal penalty barring subsequent prosecution for DUI.Â  Cuccia \r\n  was subsequently convicted of DUI and sentenced to thirty days incarceration \r\n  or a fine of $559.00.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Civil Sanction\r\nCuccia maintains his protection from double jeopardy \r\n  was violated when his license was suspended under S.C. Code Ann. section 56-1-286(A) \r\n  (Supp. 1998) and he was subsequently tried under S.C. Code Ann. section 56-5-2930 \r\n  (Supp. 1999) for DUI.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 56-1-286(A) (Supp. 2002) states:\r\n\r\nIn addition to any other penalty imposed by law unless otherwise prohibited \r\n  in this section, including additional driver's license suspensions, the Department \r\n  of Public Safety must suspend the driver's license, permit, or nonresident operating \r\n  privilege of, or deny the issuance of a license or permit to a person under \r\n  the age of twenty-one who drives a motor vehicle and has an alcohol concentration \r\n  of two one-hundredths of one percent or more. The department shall not suspend \r\n  a person's privilege to drive under this section if the person's privilege to \r\n  drive has been suspended for a violation of Section 20-7-8920, 20-7-8925, or \r\n  56-5-2930 arising from the same incident.\r\n\r\nBoth the United States Constitution and the South \r\n  Carolina Constitution protect against double jeopardy.Â  The United States Constitution, \r\n  which is applicable to South Carolina through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: \r\n  â€œ[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy \r\n  of life or limb . . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. Amend. V.Â  The South Carolina Constitution \r\n  states: â€œNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in \r\n  jeopardy of life or liberty . . . .â€Â  S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 12.Â  The â€œguarantee \r\n  [against double jeopardy] has been said to consist of three separate constitutional \r\n  protections. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after \r\n  acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after \r\n  conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.â€Â  \r\n  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 \r\n  L.

Ed. 872 (1873).Â  However, the \r\n  Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of all additional sanctions \r\n  that could, â€œin common parlance,â€ be described as punishment.Â  Hudson v. \r\n  United States, 522 U.S. 93, 98-99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 493, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997).Â Â  \r\n  â€œThe Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal \r\n  punishments for the same offense.â€Â  Id. at 99, 118 S.Ct. at 493, 139 \r\n  L.Ed.2d at 458 (emphasis in original). Â Nevertheless, the Clause may prevent \r\n  the government from subjecting a defendant to both a criminal punishment and \r\n  a civil sanction.Â  State v. Price, 333 S.C. 267, 270, 510 S.E.2d 215, \r\n  217 (1998).Â  The Double Jeopardy Clause is not automatically violated by the \r\n  mere fact that a civil penalty has some deterrent effect.Â  Id. at 270-71, \r\n  510 S.E.2d at 218.Â  To determine whether a penalty is criminal or civil, a court \r\n  must look to the face of the statute and then determine if the statutory scheme \r\n  is so punitive in purpose or effect as to transform what was intended as a civil \r\n  sanction into a criminal penalty.Â  Id. at 271, 510 S.E.2d at 218.\r\n\r\nWhether a particular punishment is criminal or civil \r\n  is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction.Â  A court must first \r\n  ask whether the legislature, â€œin establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated \r\n  either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.â€Â  Even \r\n  in those cases where the legislature â€œhas indicated an intention to establish \r\n  a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so \r\n  punitive either in purpose or effect,â€ as to â€œtransfor[m] what was clearly intended \r\n  as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\r\n\r\nHudson, 522 U.S. at 99, 118 S.Ct. at 493, 139 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 459 (internal citations omitted); see also In re Matthews, \r\n  345 S.C. 638, 648, 550 S.E.2d 311, 316 (2001) (â€œAs the United States Supreme \r\n  Court recently reiterated, the determination whether a statute is civil or criminal \r\n  is primarily a question of statutory construction, which must begin by reference \r\n  to the actâ€™s text and legislative history.â€).Â  â€œOnly the clearest proof will \r\n  suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated \r\n  as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.â€Â  Price, 333 S.C. at 271, \r\n  510 S.E.2d at 218; accord In re Matthews, 345 S.C. at 648, 550 \r\n  S.E.2d at 316.Â  The Hudson court enunciated seven factors for determining \r\n  if a statute constitutes a criminal penalty:\r\n\r\n(1) [w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; \r\n  (2) whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment; (3) whether it \r\n  comes into play only on a finding of scienter; (4) whether its operation will \r\n  promote the traditional aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence; (5) whether \r\n  the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether an alternative \r\n  purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it; and (7) \r\n  whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\r\n\r\nHudson 522 U.S. at 99-100, 118 S.Ct. at 493, 139 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 459.\r\nSection 56-1-286 allows for the suspension of a driverâ€™s license where the \r\n  person is under the age of twenty-one and registers a blood alcohol concentration \r\n  of two one-hundredths of one percent (.02%) or more. Â \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court, in State v. Price, 333 S.C. 267, 510 \r\n  S.E.2d 215 (1998), undertook an exhaustive examination of the administrative \r\n  revocation of a driverâ€™s license for the refusal to submit to a Breathalyzer \r\n  exam and determined that it is not a criminal penalty. \r\n  [2] Â  Id. at 274, 510 S.E.2d at 219.Â  The court found the following \r\n  factors determinative in reaching its conclusion:Â  (1) the authority to impose \r\n  the suspension is vested in an administrative agency [the Department of Public \r\n  Safety]; (2) the ability to operate a motor vehicle on the highways is a privilege, \r\n  rather than a right; (3) â€œthe purpose of the revocation is to protect the public \r\n  and not to punish the licensee;â€ [3] \r\n   (4) â€œthe sanctions here do not involve an â€˜affirmative disability or restraintâ€™ \r\n  as that term is normally understood;â€ (5) the sanction â€œcome[s] into play only \r\n  upon a finding of scienter, i.e., refusal to submit to testing, no one of these \r\n  factors alone is dispositive,â€ (6)â€œalthough the sanction of license revocation \r\n  may serve the goals of punishment (i.e., deterrence and retribution), the primary \r\n  goal . . . is to protect the public;â€ and (7) â€œnearly every other court which \r\n  has addressed the issue finds no double jeopardy problem is posed by the administrative \r\n  suspension of a driver's license following a drunk driving arrest or refusal \r\n  to submit to chemical testing.â€Â  Id. at 272-74, 510 S.E.2d at 218-19.\r\nWe find no reason why the rationale enounced in Price is not equally \r\n  efficacious in an analysis of a suspension under section 56-1-286.Â  The section \r\n  makes clear that the suspension is in addition to any other penalties which \r\n  are imposed by law.Â  It is clearly not intended to be the sole criminal penalty \r\n  for a person under the age of twenty-one who drives while under the influence \r\n  of alcohol.Â  The statute gives authority to the Department of Public Safety \r\n  to handle the suspension.Â  As in Price, the mere fact that the conduct \r\n  for which the sanction is imposed is also criminal is insufficient to render \r\n  the sanction criminally punitive.Â  Id. atÂ  273-74, 510 S.E.2d at 219.Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the revocation of a driverâ€™s \r\n  license, where a driver under the age of twenty-one registers a blood alcohol \r\n  concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent (.02%), is a civil sanction \r\n  which has not been transformed into a criminal punishment.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Same Elements Test\r\nUnder traditional double jeopardy analysis, multiple punishment is not prohibited \r\n  where each offense calls for proof of a fact that the other does not.Â  State \r\n  v. Owens, 309 S.C. 402, 405, 424 S.E.2d 473, 475 (1992).Â  The United States \r\n  Supreme Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have determined that in the \r\n  context of criminal penalties, the Blockburger v. United States, 284 \r\n  U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932) â€œsame elementsâ€ test is the sole \r\n  test of double jeopardy in successive prosecutions and multiple punishment cases.Â  \r\n  See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 \r\n  L. Ed. 2d 556 (1993); State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997) \r\n  (â€œ[W]e decline to extend broader protection under our state constitution than \r\n  that afforded under the federal constitution.â€).Â  As the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court noted in Price, â€œif a sanction is determined to be civil in nature \r\n  and has not been transformed into a criminal penalty, then the double jeopardy \r\n  clause is not implicated and there is simply no need to conduct a Blockburger \r\n  analysis.â€Â  Price, 333 S.C. at 271, n.4, 510 S.E.2d at 218, n.4.Â Â  \r\nHowever, once a sanction is found to be a criminal penalty, the Blockburger \r\n  â€œsame elementsâ€ test would apply.Â  Blockburger insists upon a comparison \r\n  of the elements of the two offenses to determine if â€œeach provision requires \r\n  proof of an additional fact which the other does not.â€Â  Blockburger, \r\n  284 U.S. at 304.Â  A mere overlap in proof does not constitute a double jeopardy \r\n  violation.Â  State v. Owens, 309 S.C. 402, 405, 424 S.E.2d 473, 475 (1992).\r\nSection 56-1-286 allows for the suspension of the driverâ€™s license of (1) a \r\n  person, (2) under the age of twenty-one, (3) who drives, (4) a motor vehicle, \r\n  and (5) has a blood alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent \r\n  or more.Â  Section 56-5-2930 makes it unlawful for (1) a person, (2) to drive, \r\n  (3) a motor vehicle, (4) while under the influence of alcohol, and (5) to the \r\n  extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired.\r\nSection 56-5-2930 (Supp. 2002) provides:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle within this State while:\r\n\r\n  (1) under the influence of alcohol to the extent that the person's faculties \r\n  to drive are materially and appreciably impaired;\r\n  (2) under the influence of any other drug or a combination of other drugs or \r\n  substances which cause impairment to the extent that the person's faculties \r\n  to drive are materially and appreciably impaired; or\r\n(3) under the combined influence of alcohol and any other drug or drugs or substances \r\n  which cause impairment to the extent that the person's faculties to drive are \r\n  materially and appreciably impaired.\r\n\r\nEven if we were to find the suspension of Cucciaâ€™s license under section 56-1-286 \r\n  was a criminal penalty, we hold, pursuant to the Blockburger â€œsame elementsâ€ \r\n  test, that a subsequent prosecution for DUI does not violate Cucciaâ€™s double \r\n  jeopardy protections.Â  The two provisions do not necessitate proof of identical \r\n  elements.Â  One needs an age under twenty-one with a blood alcohol of above .02%, \r\n  while the other is for any age driver whose faculties to drive are â€œmaterially \r\n  and appreciably impaired.â€Â  Violation of one provision does not result in an \r\n  automatic finding of a violation of the other provision.Â  Accordingly, pursuant \r\n  to the Blockburger â€œsame elementsâ€ test, suspending Cucciaâ€™s license \r\n  under section 56-1-286 does not prohibit a subsequent prosecution under section \r\n  56-5-2930 for DUI, as the provisions require proof of different facts.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the administrative suspension of Cucciaâ€™s \r\n  driverâ€™s license for driving with a blood alcohol level of two one-hundredths \r\n  of one percent or more while under the age of twenty-one is a civil sanction \r\n  and not a criminal penalty.Â  Additionally, we conclude even if it were transformed \r\n  into a criminal penalty, the elements for suspension of the license under section \r\n  56-1-286 are not the same as the elements for prosecuting a DUI under section \r\n  56-5-2930.Â  Indubitably, Cuccia was properly prosecuted for DUI, subsequent \r\n  to the revocation of his driverâ€™s license, without violation of the Double Jeopardy \r\n  Clause.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The Court scrutinized former S.C. Code Ann. section \r\n    56-5-2950 (Supp. 1997), which read, â€œIf a person under arrest refuses, upon \r\n    the request of a law enforcement officer, to submit to chemical tests as provided \r\n    in subsection (a) of this section, . . . the department, . . . shall suspend \r\n    his license or permit to drive, or any nonresident operating privilege for \r\n    a period of ninety days.â€Â  The section is now codified at S.C.

Dixon Lee, II, and James T. McLaren, of Columbia; \r\n  Lon H. Shull, of Mt. Pleasant; for Appellant.\r\nRobert N. Rosen, of Charleston; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â   Thomas Durrette Wooten, Jr., \r\n  (Husband) appeals several aspects of a divorce decree, including the award of \r\n  the marital home to Wife, the identificationÂ  ofÂ  certain credit card charges \r\n  incurred after the partiesâ€™ separation as marital debt, the decision to grant \r\n  Wife permanent alimony of $4,300 per month, and the award to Wife of $52,917.21 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm as modified in part and reverse and \r\n  remand in part.\r\nHusband and Mona Rae Wooten (Wife) were married \r\n  in 1976.Â  They have three children, all of whom are past the age of majority.\r\nThe parties married while Husband was completing \r\n  medical school and Wife was employed as a nursing instructor at The Medical \r\n  University of South Carolina.Â  Husband finished his residency in 1980 and the \r\n  couple moved to Columbia for him to pursue open-heart surgery anesthetics.Â  \r\n  A year later they moved back to the Charleston area and purchased a riverfront \r\n  home on Johns Island.Â  The couple transformed the house, which was described \r\n  as â€œbarely livable,â€ into a five-bedroom home containing nearly 5,000 square \r\n  feet and valued at $675,000.00 at the time of the divorce hearing. Â \r\nDuring the marriage, the parties enjoyed a comfortable, \r\n  if not extravagant lifestyle, which was largely centered on outdoor activities \r\n  such as boating, hunting, and fishing.Â  Husband and the partiesâ€™ older daughter \r\n  and son were actively involved in hunting and fishing. Â Wife described fishing \r\n  as Husbandâ€™s â€œmain love.â€ \r\nWife stayed home with the children while they were \r\n  small and worked in Husbandâ€™s practice as a bookkeeper. Â In 1995, Wife went \r\n  to work in the Charleston County Coronerâ€™s office. Â At the time of trial, Wife \r\n  was employed as the deputy coroner for Charleston County earning a salary of \r\n  approximately $47,000 per year.Â  Husband was earning approximately $217,000 \r\n  per year. \r\nAt some point during the marriage, Husband admitted \r\n  to Wife that he had been unfaithful to her with the wife of another anesthesiologist \r\n  while away at a medical meeting. Â Wife testified that Husband also admitted \r\n  to her that he had been sexually intimate with the wife of a fishing buddy. \r\n  Â Husband, however, testified that he had only engaged in a one-night stand with \r\n  the wife of someone he fished with while at a fishing tournament in Kiawah. \r\n  Â Â \r\nIn 1986 or 1987, approximately twelve years before \r\n  the parties separated, Wife began a year-long affair with a family friend.Â  \r\n  The affair continued even after Husband confronted Wife, and subsequently the \r\n  parties entered counseling. Â The parties saw four or five different counselors \r\n  during this troubled time in their marriage.Â  Â Â \r\nIn February of 1999, Husband \r\n  left the marital home and subsequently underwent a vasectomy.Â  Although Wife \r\n  sought a reconciliation, Husband informed the partiesâ€™ marriage counselor that \r\n  he no longer loved Wife and only wanted to discuss a division of their marital \r\n  assets.\r\nHusband commenced this action \r\n  in June of 1999 for an order of separate maintenance and support and an equitable \r\n  division of the partiesâ€™ assets and debts.Â  Wife answered and counterclaimed \r\n  seeking a divorce on the ground of adultery, possession and ownership of the \r\n  marital home, equitable division of marital property, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Â \r\nAt trial, the parties announced \r\n  they had reached an agreement regarding the division of their personal property. \r\n  Â Husband also conceded that Wife was entitled to alimony and to an equal division \r\n  of the marital estate.Â  The remaining issues were tried over a five-day period \r\n  after which the family court judge issued a final order granting Wife a divorce \r\n  on the ground of adultery.Â  \r\nAlthough Husband conceded at trial that Wife was \r\n  entitled to a fifty-fifty division of the marital estate, he requested that \r\n  the only asset of the parties that can be readily liquidated, the marital home, \r\n  be sold to accomplish this division.Â  The court valued the marital estate at \r\n  $1,571,103. [1]  To accomplish the fifty-fifty division of the marital estate, \r\n  the family court judge awarded the marital home to Wife, together with its mortgage \r\n  debt, her retirement account, and $137,395.50 from Husbandâ€™s retirement account.Â  \r\n  Husband was awarded his interest in his medical practice valued at $41,000, \r\n  the remainder of his retirement account, and indebtedness totaling $83,552.Â  \r\n  The family court also awarded Wife $4,300 per month in permanent, periodic alimony, \r\n  and $52,917.21 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, \r\n  this court has jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with our own view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, we are mindful of the fact that the \r\n  family court judge, who had an opportunity to observe the witnesses, was in \r\n  a better position to evaluate their testimony.Â  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. \r\n  448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Credit Card Debt\r\nHusband asserts the family court judge erred in identifying \r\n  $12,332 in credit card charges incurred by Wife after the partiesâ€™ separation \r\n  as marital debt and in allocating that debt to him.Â  We agree.\r\nWife testified that although \r\n  Husband initially paid all household bills when he left the marital home, sometime \r\n  in June of 1999 he told her that she should start paying some of the bills. \r\n  Â After that time, and up until the time of the temporary hearing, Husband paid \r\n  the mortgage payments on the marital home while Wife used her credit card for \r\n  other expenses such as food and veterinary bills.Â  Wife testified that she had \r\n  a credit card bill of $12,322. Â The family court judge treated this debt as \r\n  a marital debt subject to equitable apportionment.Â  We find that this was error.\r\nâ€œMarital propertyâ€ for purposes \r\n  of the South Carolina Apportionment of Marital Property Act is defined in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2002) as â€œall real and personal property which has \r\n  been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of \r\n  the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .â€ (emphasis \r\n  supplied). Moreover, in making an equitable apportionment, the family court \r\n  should consider â€œ. . . any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either \r\n  of them during the course of the marriage[.]â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) \r\n  (Supp. 2002). â€œ[S]ection 20-7-472 creates a [rebuttable] presumption that a \r\n  debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is a marital \r\n  debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â  Hardy \r\n  v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993) (emphasis \r\n  supplied).\r\nBecause it is undisputed Wife \r\n  incurred these credit card charges subsequent to the filing of marital litigation, \r\n  it was error for the family court judge to have considered them as a marital \r\n  debt subject to equitable apportionment. \r\n  [2] Â  Accordingly, we reverse this portion of the family courtâ€™s order allocating \r\n  the credit card debt to Husband.\r\nII.Â  Marital Home\r\nHusband next contends the family \r\n  court judge erred in awarding Wife ownership of the marital home as part of \r\n  her share of the marital estate, arguing it was inequitable to award Wife the \r\n  only asset of the parties that readily lends itself to liquidation.Â  We agree.\r\nHusbandâ€™s position throughout \r\n  trial was that although Wife was entitled to share equally in the marital estate, \r\n  the marital home should be sold to enable the parties to capture its substantial \r\n  equity.Â  At the time of trial, the marital home, which was titled in Wifeâ€™s \r\n  name, had equity of at least $539,349.Â  Husband proposed that the home be jointly \r\n  titled in both partiesâ€™ names and sold so that the parties could combine their \r\n  $250,000 exclusions for capital gains taxes.Â  Gerald Feinberg, a CPA, testified \r\n  for Husband concerning the tax consequences to the parties of the various methods \r\n  of equitable distribution.Â  Feinberg testified that if the parties sold the \r\n  marital home together, they could take advantage of the joint capital gains \r\n  exclusion of $500,000.Â  He further testified that if Wife was awarded the home \r\n  and Husband had to liquidate his retirement account in order to satisfy the \r\n  remaining equitable division award and to make a down payment on a residence \r\n  for himself, he would suffer substantial tax and withdrawal penalties.Â  Feinberg \r\n  testified these penalties would result in Husband losing fifty-one percent of \r\n  the value of any retirement funds he withdrew.Â  Wife, on the other hand, testified \r\n  that she wanted to be awarded the marital home in partial satisfaction of her \r\n  equitable share because â€œ[I]tâ€™s my home.Â  Itâ€™s where my life is centered. ...Itâ€™s \r\n  where I have my kids and enjoyment.Â  Itâ€™s where I have my friends and enjoyment.â€ \r\n\r\nIn awarding the marital home \r\n  to Wife as part of her equitable share, the family court judge specifically \r\n  stated that she had not given Husbandâ€™s fault any weight.Â  She likewise held \r\n  that in awarding the home to Wife, she did not consider the childrenâ€™s use of \r\n  the home, as they were all emancipated and Husband had no obligation to support \r\n  them other than their college education. Â These findings were not appealed from \r\n  and are therefore the law of this case.Â  See Buckner v. Preferred \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 177 S.E.2d 544 (1970) (stating that an issue \r\n  which is not challenged on appeal, whether right or wrong, becomes the law of \r\n  the case). \r\nAdditionally, the family court judge specifically \r\n  noted that she had not considered the tax ramifications of the sale of the house \r\n  and the taxability of the pension payments. Â Relying on Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, \r\n  323 S.C. 283, 473 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 1996), the family court judge found that \r\n  she was precluded from dividing the partiesâ€™ property based on after-tax dollars \r\n  stating that, â€œTo make a decision based on after-tax dollars is for this Court \r\n  to engage in speculation as to what the parties will do in the future.â€ \r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within \r\n  the family court judgeâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 97, \r\n  561 S.E.2d 610, 616 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Section 20-7-472 lists fifteen factors \r\n  for the family court to consider when making an equitable apportionment of the \r\n  marital estate and vests the family court with the discretion to determine what \r\n  weight should be assigned to each factor.Â  On review, this court looks to the \r\n  overall fairness of the apportionment, and if the result is equitable, taken \r\n  as a whole, that this court might have weighed specific factors differently \r\n  than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the family court judge \r\n  abused her discretion in awarding the marital home to Wife as part of the equitable \r\n  division.Â  Case law indicates that the family court judge should first attempt \r\n  an in-kind distribution. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 \r\n  S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  However, an in-kind distribution is most equitable \r\n  where the assets being divided are similar in character.Â  In our view, the family \r\n  court judgeâ€™s decision to award Wife the major marketable asset of the parties, \r\n  while awarding Husband primarily his retirement account, was not an equitable \r\n  in-kind distribution.Â  Under Husbandâ€™s proposal, all assets of the parties \r\n  would have been equally divided on a fifty-fifty basis.Â  Under Wifeâ€™s proposal, \r\n  the captured equity in the marital home was viewed as being equivalent to Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement plan, despite the fact that the equity in the marital home was readily \r\n  available with little or no tax consequence to Wife and the funds in Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement plan were subject to a total penalty of fifty-one percent if withdrawn.Â Â  \r\n\r\nWife presented no testimony \r\n  to dispute the testimony of Husband and his expert concerning the tax ramifications \r\n  of the proposals for equitable division.Â  Therefore, in this case it is uncontradicted \r\n  that the Husbandâ€™s proposal for equitable division would have allowed the parties \r\n  to take advantage of the joint $500,000 capital gains exclusion while the Wifeâ€™s \r\n  proposal would result in the Husband incurring a severe penalty of over fifty \r\n  per cent in the liquidation of a portion of his retirement fund.Â  Moreover, \r\n  we believe the family court incorrectly concluded that appellate case law precluded \r\n  her from considering the tax consequences of the equitable distribution.\r\nIn Ellerbe, the husband \r\n  asserted the family court judge erred in discounting the value of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  retirement plans when the order did not require the plans to be liquidated.Â  \r\n  This court agreed, finding that â€œ[b]ecause we see no need for the accounts \r\n  to be liquidated, we hold the family court erred in valuing the partiesâ€™ \r\n  retirement accounts at 48% of their face values.â€Â  323 S.C. at 289, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  at 885 (emphasis supplied).Â  Here, as in Ellerbe, the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order does not contemplate the liquidation of the Husbandâ€™s retirement account.Â  \r\n  However, we believe it was an error for the family court to have disregarded \r\n  Husbandâ€™s substantial evidence establishing the necessity to withdraw funds \r\n  from his retirement account to comply with the family courtâ€™s division of the \r\n  marital property.Â  Because the family court should have recognized Husbandâ€™s \r\n  need to liquidate the account, the tax consequences of that liquidation should \r\n  have been considered.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-472(11) (Supp. 2002) (specifically \r\n  requiring the family court to consider â€œthe tax consequences to each or either \r\n  party as a result of any particular form of equitable apportionment[.]â€).Â  The \r\n  family court judge apparently interpreted Ellerbe to hold that potential \r\n  tax ramifications should never be considered by the family court in deciding \r\n  how to fashion an equitable division if the chosen method of division in the \r\n  order does not expressly require liquidation of an asset.Â  This restrictive \r\n  interpretation is flawed where, as here, in comparing competing alternatives \r\n  for division of the property, the tax consequences should have been considered \r\n  in order to accomplish an equitable division in the first place.Â  \r\nWe likewise find the case of \r\n  Bowers distinguishable.Â  In Bowers, this court declined to find \r\n  error when the family court judge failed to consider the tax consequences resulting \r\n  from its award to the wife of one-half the value of the husbandâ€™s 401(k) account.Â  \r\n  Citing Ellerbe, this court found no abuse of discretion, but stated there \r\n  was no evidence that either party anticipated liquidation of the account.Â  This \r\n  is in marked contrast to the evidence presented here from Husband and his expert \r\n  witness that he would be required to liquidate his retirement account in order \r\n  to comply with the order and to acquire a home for himself.\r\nSouth Carolina appellate courts have carefully \r\n  protected the rights of spouses to realize the benefits of equity in a marital \r\n  home.Â  For instance, before awarding a spouse the exclusive possession of the \r\n  home as an incident of support, family courts are required to â€œcarefully consider \r\n  the claim of a party that the interests of that party or the children are so \r\n  predominant, when balanced against the interests of the other, that an award \r\n  of exclusive possession of the marital home is compelled.â€Â  Johnson \r\n  v. Johnson, 285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The rationale for scrutinizing such requests lies in the substantial \r\n  burden upon the party who must defer realization of the value of his or her \r\n  share of the marital home.Â  Morris v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525, 534, 517 \r\n  S.E.2d 720, 725 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Morris, the only assets of significant \r\n  value were the marital home and the retirement account.Â  This court found the \r\n  family court judge properly denied the wifeâ€™s request for exclusive possession \r\n  of the marital home as an incident of support.Â  Significantly, we stated, â€œBy \r\n  delaying [the husbandâ€™s] realization of his equity in the home, he is left \r\n  with no liquid assets with which to establish his new life, apart from the \r\n  income he earns.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis added).\r\nWe see no reason to apply less \r\n  protection in cases considering the exclusive award of the marital home to one \r\n  spouse, against the otherâ€™s desire, as that spouseâ€™s share of the marital estate.Â  \r\n  Wife presented no evidence to compel the family court to award her the exclusive \r\n  possession of the home.Â  The realization of Husbandâ€™s share of the equity in \r\n  the present case is not merely delayed; it is terminated.Â  We believe this result \r\n  casts an even more inequitable burden upon Husband than cases awarding exclusive \r\n  possession as an incident of support.Â Â  The family courtâ€™s apportionment of \r\n  the marital estate requires Husband to begin anew without the benefit of his \r\n  share of the equity accumulated in the only marketable asset of the marital \r\n  estate; a result we disapproved of in Morris.\r\nTaking our own view of the evidence \r\n  presented in this case, we do not believe that the apportionment of marital \r\n  assets was fair to both parties.Â  Wifeâ€™s emotional attachment to the marital \r\n  home should not outweigh the undisputed expert testimony that in order to effect \r\n  a division which is equitable to both parties, the marital home should be sold \r\n  and the parties should realize the benefits of the $500,000 capital gains exclusion. \r\n  We find it was error for the family court judge to have viewed these two assetsâ€“the \r\n  equity in the marital home and Husbandâ€™s retirement planâ€“as though they were \r\n  equivalent assets.Â  The family court abused its discretion in awarding the marital \r\n  home to Wife in the face of undisputed testimony that both parties would realize \r\n  a significant tax benefit by selling the home and dividing its proceeds.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse this portion of the family courtâ€™s order and remand this issue back \r\n  to the family court to enter an order consistent with this opinion.\r\nIII.Â  Alimony\r\nHusband next argues the family \r\n  court judgeâ€™s award of $4,300 per month in permanent periodic alimony was excessive.Â  \r\n  Although the alimony award does not appear excessive in view of the disparity \r\n  in the partiesâ€™ incomes and the length of the marriage, the family court judge \r\n  based this alimony award upon her assumption that Wife would be residing in \r\n  the marital home.Â  Accordingly, she considered Wifeâ€™s many needs and expenses \r\n  that would be associated with her ownership and maintenance of that home, such \r\n  as an additional $300 to be used by Wife in acquiring a boat.Â  Because we have \r\n  reversed that portion of the family court order which awarded Wife the marital \r\n  home as part of her equitable apportionment, we feel compelled to remand the \r\n  issue of alimony to the family court for recalculation in light of Wifeâ€™s present \r\n  needs.Â  See Ellerbe, 323 S.C. at 297, 473 S.E.2d at 889 (remanding \r\n  the issue of alimony for reconsideration in light of remanding the issue of \r\n  the equitable division award, which is a factor relevant to the award of alimony).\r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs\r\nFinally, Husband asserts the \r\n  family court judge erred in awarding Wife $52,917.21 in attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs. [3] Â  He argues the court erred in awarding any fees to Wife because \r\n  of the numerous errors he asserts she made in the trial order.Â  He further contends \r\n  the amount of the award was excessive given his financial condition.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees will \r\n  not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson, 295 S.C. \r\n  at 415, 368 S.E.2d at 903.Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  the family court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained by counsel, the respective financial conditions \r\n  of the parties, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  \r\n  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\n  When determining the amount of fees to award, the court is to consider \r\n  the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily \r\n  devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  \r\n  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).\r\nEven though Husband prevailed \r\n  on two of the equitable division issues in this appeal, the beneficial results \r\n  obtained are only one of several factors to be considered by the family court \r\n  in deciding whether or not to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The other factors outlined \r\n  above clearly militate in favor of an award to Wife.Â  Moreover, Wifeâ€™s attorney \r\n  received a favorable result on the issue of divorce and on the issue of alimony, \r\n  which this court remanded only because of our decision on the equitable division \r\n  of the marital home.Â  Finally, Husband commenced this action for separate support \r\n  and maintenance and Wife was required to obtain competent counsel to defend \r\n  it.Â  \r\nNor are we persuaded that the \r\n  amount of fees and costs awarded by the family court was excessive under the \r\n  circumstances.Â  Husband testified at trial that his own attorneyâ€™s and accountantâ€™s \r\n  fees were $70,000, although the family court judge found in her order that he \r\n  had incurred fees and costs of $58,998.24. Â Â \r\nWifeâ€™s counsel is an accomplished family practitioner \r\n  with an excellent reputation in the community.Â  Particularly given the wide \r\n  disparity in the partiesâ€™ incomes, we do not believe it was error for the family \r\n  court judge to have awarded Wife the entire amount of her attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs incurred in defending this action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the family court judgeâ€™s award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, reverse her decision to treat Wifeâ€™s credit card \r\n  charges incurred after the date of filing as a debt subject to equitable division, \r\n  reverse her decision to award Wife the marital home as part of her equitable \r\n  division and direct that the home be sold, and remand the equitable division \r\n  and alimony issues to the family court for further consideration consistent \r\n  with this opinion.\r\nCURETON J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON J., dissents in a separate decision.Â  \r\n  \r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In this domestic \r\n  case, Thomas Durrette Wooten, Jr. (Husband) appeals from an order of the Family \r\n  Court.Â  The issues include identification of marital debt, equitable division \r\n  of marital property, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  I disagree with \r\n  the analysis and reasoning of the majority.Â  I vote to affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and modify in part.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Mona Rae Wooten (Wife) were married in 1976.Â  They have \r\n  three children, all of whom are past the age of majority.\r\n At the time of the marriage, Husband was on the verge of completing \r\n  medical school at the Medical University of South Carolina and Wife was employed \r\n  at the University as a nursing instructor.Â  When Husband completed his residency, \r\n  the parties moved to Columbia so Husband could take a job performing open heart \r\n  surgery anesthetics.\r\nAfter approximately one year, the parties moved to Mt. Pleasant.Â  \r\n  Soon thereafter, Husband and Wife purchased a home on Johns Island, where they \r\n  lived throughout the duration of the marriage.Â  Although the home, located on \r\n  two acres of riverfront property, was â€œbarely livableâ€ at the time of the purchase, \r\n  the parties renovated, restored, expanded, and otherwise improved the home.Â  \r\n  Eventually, the home became an integral part of the partiesâ€™ lifestyles, particularly \r\n  that of Wife.Â  The parties did not travel extensively or host extravagant parties, \r\n  but often entertained friends in the home and participated in boating and other \r\n  recreational activities on the river.Â  Husband and Wife purchased about twenty-four \r\n  boats during the marriage, ranging in size from a jon boat to a thirty-five \r\n  foot ocean-going fishing vessel.\r\nAround February 10, 1999, Husband left the marital home and refused to tell \r\n  Wife where he was planning to live.Â  One month later, he informed the partiesâ€™ \r\n  marriage counselor he no longer loved his wife and only wanted to discuss division \r\n  of their assets.Â  On March 19, 1999, Husband underwent a vasectomy.Â  Husband \r\n  admitted he was romantically involved with Pam Perry, his then married co-worker, \r\n  in April of 1999, although he denied any prior romantic involvement with her. \r\n\r\nFor a time immediately following the partiesâ€™ separation, Husband \r\n  paid Wifeâ€™s expenses.Â  After Husband told Wife she would have to start paying \r\n  her bills from her own money, Wife began relying heavily on use of her credit \r\n  cards to make purchases such as food and prescription drugs, and to pay college \r\n  tuition for one of the partiesâ€™ children.\r\nHusband filed this action in June of 1999 seeking, inter alia, \r\n  an order allowing him to live separate and apart from Wife and equitably apportioning \r\n  the partiesâ€™ marital property and debts.Â  Wife answered and counterclaimed, \r\n  seeking a divorce on the ground of adultery, possession and ownership of the \r\n  marital home, equitable division of marital property, an award of alimony, and \r\n  ancillary relief.\r\nThe Family Court heard the action over five days \r\n  in April and May of 2000.Â  The parties reached an agreement as to equal division \r\n  of their personal property, such that the central issues remaining for adjudication \r\n  at trial were alimony and the equitable division of marital property.Â  The parties \r\n  agreed on a fifty-fifty division of the marital estate.\r\n The Family Court valued the partiesâ€™ marital estate \r\n  at $1,328,156.Â  The principal assets consisted of the marital home, which had \r\n  a fair market value of $675,000 and an equitable value of $539,349; Husbandâ€™s \r\n  $844,026 retirement accounts; Wifeâ€™s $11,077 retirement plan; and Husbandâ€™s \r\n  $41,000 interest in his medical practice. \r\nThe Family Court granted Wife a divorce on the ground \r\n  of adultery and determined the marital estate should be divided equally between \r\n  the parties.Â  To accomplish this division, the court awarded Wife full ownership \r\n  of the marital home, together with its mortgage debt, her retirement account, \r\n  and $137,395.50 from the husbandâ€™s retirement accounts.Â  The court awarded Husband \r\n  his interest in his medical practice and the remainder of his retirement accounts, \r\n  and allocated indebtedness to him totaling $83,552.50. The court found Wife \r\n  was entitled to $4,300 per month in permanent periodic alimony, and $52,917.21 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Husbandâ€™s post-trial motion for reconsideration \r\n  was denied.\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the Family Court, this Court has jurisdiction to find the facts \r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury \r\n  v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 569 S.E.2d 367 (2002); Hopkins v. Hopkins, \r\n  343 S.C. 301, 540 S.E.2d 454 (2000); Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This tribunal, however, is not required to \r\n  disregard the Family Courtâ€™s findings.Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, \r\n  543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Likewise, we are not obligated to ignore the fact the \r\n  Family Court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d \r\n  610 (Ct. App. 2002); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997); see also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (ruling that because \r\n  appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it \r\n  should accord great deference to the Family Courtâ€™s findings where matters of \r\n  credibility are involved); Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 298 S.C. 144, \r\n  378 S.E.2d 609 (Ct. App. 1989) (holding the resolution of questions regarding \r\n  credibility and the weight given to testimony is a function of the Family Court \r\n  judge who heard the testimony).Â  Because the appellate court lacks the opportunity \r\n  for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial \r\n  court findings where matters of credibility are involved.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, \r\n  342 S.C. 324, 536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Credit Card Debt\r\nHusband argues the Family Court erred in identifying $12,332 in credit card \r\n  charges as marital debt subject to equitable division, and in allocating the \r\n  debt to him, inasmuch as Wife incurred the debt after this action was commenced.Â  \r\n  I agree the debt should not have been allocated to Husband.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2002) provides in pertinent part:\r\nIn making apportionment, the court must give weight \r\n  in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors:\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n(13)Â  liens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves \r\n  must be equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, \r\n  and any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during \r\n  the course of the marriage . . . .\r\n\r\nDebts incurred for marital purposes are subject to equitable distribution.Â  \r\n  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 545 S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Section \r\n  20-7-472 creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred \r\n  prior to marital litigation is a marital debt, and must be factored into \r\n  the totality of equitable apportionment.Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. \r\n  97, 463 S.E.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nâ€œMarital debtâ€ has been defined as debt incurred for the joint benefit of the \r\n  parties regardless of whether the parties are legally jointly liable for the \r\n  debt or whether one party is legally individually liable.Â  Thomas v. Thomas, \r\n  346 S.C. 20, 550 S.E.2d 580 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. granted, Jan. 24, \r\n  2002; Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 429 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  In equitably dividing a marital estate, the Family Court is to consider the \r\n  net estate, and must apportion marital debt in conjunction with the apportionment \r\n  of assets.Â  Hardy, 311 S.C. at 437, 429 S.E.2d at 813; see also \r\n  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997) (marital \r\n  debt is a factor to be considered in making the equitable apportionment).Â  Marital \r\n  debt, like marital property, must be specifically identified and apportioned \r\n  in equitable distribution.Â  Smith, 327 S.C. at 457, 486 S.E.2d at 520 \r\n  (section 20-7-472 implicitly requires that marital debt, like marital property, \r\n  be specifically identified and apportioned in the equitable distribution); Frank \r\n  v. Frank, 311 S.C. 454, 429 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The same rules \r\n  of fairness and equity which apply to the equitable division of marital property \r\n  also apply to the division of marital debts.Â  Hardy, 311 S.C. at 437, \r\n  429 S.E.2d at 813-14.\r\nThe burden of proving a spouseâ€™s debt as nonmarital rests upon the party who \r\n  makes such an assertion.Â  Hickum, 320 S.C. at 103, 463 S.E.2d at 324.Â  \r\n  If the trial judge finds that a spouseâ€™s debt was not made for marital purposes, \r\n  it need not be factored into the courtâ€™s equitable apportionment of the marital \r\n  estate, and the trial judge may require payment by the spouse who created the \r\n  debt for nonmarital purposes.Â  Id.\r\nEven where a spouse individually incurs debt after a marital separation \r\n  but before a divorce decree is entered, the debt should be apportioned in accordance \r\n  with the principles of equitable distribution where there is a showing that \r\n  the debt was incurred for the joint benefit of both parties.Â  SeeÂ  Peirson \r\n  v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 417 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 1992); see also \r\n  Allen v. Allen, 287 S.C. 501, 339 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding \r\n  that while it is proper to consider marital debts in making an equitable distribution \r\n  of marital assets, it is also incumbent upon the court which apportions such \r\n  debts to ensure the debts were incurred for the joint benefit of the parties \r\n  during the marriage).\r\nIn the instant case, Wife has made no showing, and I am unable to \r\n  discern from the record on appeal, that the credit card debts she incurred during \r\n  the partiesâ€™ separation were incurred for any purpose inuring to the benefit \r\n  of Husband.Â  Rather, Wife testified she used her credit card to pay part of \r\n  a college tuition bill for one of the partiesâ€™ children and to buy medication, \r\n  food, and clothing.Â  While these were perhaps legitimate expenses, the resulting \r\n  credit card debt was not, in my view, incurred for the joint benefit of the \r\n  parties within the meaning of the governing statute and applicable case law.Â  \r\n  Moreover, these credit card charges were incurred by Wife subsequent \r\n  to the filing of marital litigation.Â  The court erred in considering the credit \r\n  card charges as marital debt subject to equitable apportionment.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  I agree with the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the portion of the Family Courtâ€™s \r\n  order allocating the credit card debt to Husband.\r\nII.Â  Marital Home\r\nHusband asserts the Family Court erred in awarding Wife ownership \r\n  of the marital home as part of her share in the marital estate.Â  I disagree.\r\nThe Family Court is given broad jurisdiction in the equitable distribution \r\n  of marital property.Â  Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 461 S.E.2d 39 (1995); \r\n  see also Greene v. Greene 351 S.C. 329, 569 S.E.2d 393 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002) (holding Family Court has wide discretion in determining how marital property \r\n  is to be distributed).Â  The court may use any reasonable means to divide the \r\n  property equitably.Â  Bowyer v. Sohn, 290 S.C. 249, 349 S.E.2d 403 (1986); \r\n  Belton v. Belton, 325 S.C. 456, 481 S.E.2d 174 (Ct. App. 1997); see \r\n  also Coxe v. Coxe, 294 S.C. 291, 363 S.E.2d 906 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating \r\n  Family Court judges are given broad jurisdiction in equitable distribution of \r\n  marital property and trial judge may use any reasonable means to divide estate \r\n  equitably). Â The apportionment of marital property is within the Family Court \r\n  judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); Peirson \r\n  v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 417 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIn order to effect an equitable apportionment, the Family Court may require \r\n  the sale of marital property and a division of the proceeds.Â  Donahue v. \r\n  Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-476 \r\n  (Supp. 2002) (providing that â€œ[t]he court in making an equitable apportionment \r\n  may order the public or private sale of all or any portion of the marital property \r\n  upon terms it determines.â€).Â  The court, however, should first attempt an â€œin-kindâ€ \r\n  distribution of the marital assets.Â  Donahue, 299 S.C. at 360, 384 S.E.2d \r\n  at 745; Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988).Â  \r\n  A Family Court may grant a spouse title to the marital home as part of the equitable \r\n  distribution.Â  Donahue, 299 S.C. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to Â§ 20-7-472(10) of the South Carolina Code, the court, in making apportionment, \r\n  â€œmust give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following \r\n  factors: . . . (10) the desirability of awarding the family home as part of \r\n  equitable distribution.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(10) (Supp. 2002).\r\nSection 20-7-472 lists fifteen factors for the Family Court to consider \r\n  when making an equitable apportionment of the marital estate.Â  Bowers, \r\n  349 S.C. at 97, 561 S.E.2d at 616.Â  The statute vests the Family Court with \r\n  the discretion to decide what weight should be assigned to the various factors.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  On review, this Court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, \r\n  and if the result is equitable, that this Court might have weighed specific \r\n  factors differently than the Family Court is irrelevant.Â  Id.\r\nIn deciding to award Wife the marital home in partial realization \r\n  of her share in the marital estate, the Family Court expressly weighed: the \r\n  length of time the parties and their children resided in the home during the \r\n  marriage; Wifeâ€™s desire to remain in the home; and the central role the home \r\n  played in the partiesâ€™ lifestyles during the marriage.Â  As well, the court considered \r\n  the fact that Wifeâ€™s deceased father personally performed much of the woodwork \r\n  on the home during the process of renovation.Â  Pointedly, the court specifically \r\n  noted that it â€œcould not award the marital home to the Wife no matter how desirable \r\n  unless it were a part of the fifty percent (50%) of the marital estate to which \r\n  she is entitled.â€\r\nUnder these facts and circumstances, there is no error or abuse of \r\n  discretion in the Family Courtâ€™s decision to award Wife the marital home instead \r\n  of ordering its sale.Â  I am particularly convinced of the propriety of the courtâ€™s \r\n  decision in this regard in light of Husbandâ€™s vastly superior income and ability \r\n  to purchase a home without the necessity of divesting Wife of the marital home.\r\nIII.Â  Tax \r\n  Ramifications\r\nHusband claims \r\n  the Family Court erred in failing to consider the tax consequences in the division \r\n  of the marital estate.Â  I disagree.\r\nIn Ellerbe \r\n  v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283, 473 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 1996), the Court of Appeals \r\n  analyzed tax issues in connection with equitable apportionment and stated:\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(11) (Supp. 1995) requires \r\n  the family court to consider the tax consequences to each party resulting from \r\n  equitable apportionment.Â  However, if the apportionment order does not contemplate \r\n  the liquidation or sale of an asset, then it is an abuse of discretion for the \r\n  court to consider the tax consequences from a supposed sale or liquidation.Â  \r\n  See Graham v. Graham, 301 S.C. 128, 390 S.E.2d 469 (Ct. App. 1990); \r\n  see also Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 429 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  Moreover, a transfer of these funds from one party to the other as a part of \r\n  an equitable division should not result in a tax consequence.Â  Josey v. Josey, \r\n  291 S.C. 26, 351 S.E.2d 891 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Here, the parties were awarded \r\n  their respective accounts.Â  Because we see no need for the accounts to be liquidated, \r\n  we hold the family court erred in valuing the partiesâ€™ retirement accounts at \r\n  48% of their face values.Â  In redetermining equitable distribution, the family \r\n  court shall consider the face values of the partiesâ€™ retirement accounts.\r\n\r\nId. at 289, 473 \r\n  S.E.2d at 884-85.\r\nAfter Ellerbe, \r\n  this Court, in Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002), examined tax effects as applied to the valuation and distribution of \r\n  the husbandâ€™s 401(k) account.Â  Bowers explicates:\r\n\r\nWe further find no error in the Family Courtâ€™s failure to \r\n  expressly consider tax consequences resulting from its award to Wife of one-half \r\n  the value of Husbandâ€™s 401(k) account.Â  Where an order of equitable apportionment \r\n  does not contemplate the liquidation or sale of an asset, it is an abuse of \r\n  discretion for the court to consider the tax consequences from a supposed sale \r\n  or liquidation.Â  Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283, 473 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  Here, the courtâ€™s order does not require or contemplate liquidation \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s 401(k) account and there is no evidence indicating either party \r\n  anticipated liquidation of the account.\r\n\r\nId. at 97-98, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d at 617.\r\nI reject the \r\n  contention by Husband that the apportionment of marital property in the case \r\n  sub judice contemplates the liquidation or sale of an asset.Â  \r\n  The courtâ€™s order does not require or contemplate liquidation of Husbandâ€™s retirement \r\n  accounts or the sale of the house.Â  Husband asseverates that, in actuality, \r\n  he will be required to liquidate either the retirement accounts or to sell the \r\n  house or both in an attempt to comply financially with the courtâ€™s distribution.\r\nIn contrariety to Husbandâ€™s argument, there is no evidence indicating \r\n  he will be required to engage in a liquidation of the retirement accounts or \r\n  to sell the house, other than his self-serving assertions.Â  The Family Court \r\n  did not err in failing to expressly consider tax consequences resulting from \r\n  its award to Wife of the house.\r\nIV.Â  Alimony\r\nHusband contends the Family Courtâ€™s award to Wife of $4,300 per month in permanent \r\n  periodic alimony was excessive.Â  I agree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny alimony rests within the discretion of the Family \r\n  Court judge.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 569 S.E.2d 367 (2002); \r\n  Clardy v. Clardy, 266 S.C. 270, 222 S.E.2d 771 (1976); Hatfield v. \r\n  Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The judgeâ€™s discretion, \r\n  when exercised in light of the facts of each particular case, will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent abuse thereof.Â  Dearybury, 351 S.C. at 282, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  at 369; Long v. Long, 247 S.C. 250, 146 S.E.2d 873 (1966).Â  An abuse \r\n  of discretion occurs when the judge is controlled by some error of law or where \r\n  the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.Â  Sharps \r\n  v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 535 S.E.2d 913 (2000); Stewart v. Floyd, \r\n  274 S.C. 437, 265 S.E.2d 254 (1980).\r\nAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital \r\n  relationship.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989); \r\n  Morris v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525, 517 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 1999); Johnson \r\n  v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 372 S.E.2d 107 (Ct. App. 1988). Generally, alimony \r\n  should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position \r\n  of support he or she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 \r\n  S.C. 177, 554 S.E.2d 421 (Ct. App. 2001); McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. \r\n  583, 506 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  It is the duty of the Family Court to make \r\n  an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well founded.Â  \r\n  Hinson v. Hinson, 341 S.C. 574, 535 S.E.2d 143 (Ct. App. 2000); Woodward \r\n  v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 363 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Alimony should \r\n  not, however, serve as a disincentive for spouses to improve their employment \r\n  potential or to dissuade them from providing, to the extent possible, for their \r\n  own support.Â  Williamson v. Williamson, 311 S.C. 47, 426 S.E.2d 758 (1993); \r\n  McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 506 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1998); Brandi \r\n  v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 396 S.E.2d 124 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nIn making an award of alimony, the following factors must be considered and \r\n  weighed: (1) the duration of the marriage and ages of the parties at the time \r\n  of the marriage and at the time of the divorce; (2) the physical and emotional \r\n  condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse, together \r\n  with the need of each spouse for additional training or education in order to \r\n  achieve that spouseâ€™s income potential; (4) the employment history and earning \r\n  potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the \r\n  marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses; \r\n  (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spouses; \r\n  (8) the properties of the parties, including those apportioned to him or her \r\n  in the divorce or separate maintenance action; (9) custody of the children; \r\n  (10) marital misconduct or fault of either or both parties if the misconduct \r\n  has affected the economic circumstances of the parties, or contributed to the \r\n  breakup of the marriage; (11) tax consequences; (12) existence of any support \r\n  obligations from a prior marriage; and (13) such other factors the court considers \r\n  relevant.Â  Dearybury, 351 S.C. at 282-83, 569 S.E.2d at 369; Patel \r\n  v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 555 S.E.2d 386 (2001); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) \r\n  (Supp. 2002).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. \r\n  155, 283 S.E.2d 832 (1981); Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 425.\r\nI am compelled to agree with Husband that, in this case, \r\n  the Family Court arrived at an excessive amount in determining Wifeâ€™s award \r\n  of alimony.Â  At the time of trial, Husband was fifty-one years old and earned \r\n  about $217,000 annually.Â  Wife was fifty-two years old, employed as a Deputy \r\n  Coroner for Charleston County, and earned approximately $47,000 annually, or \r\n  $3,924 per month.Â  According to Wifeâ€™s financial declaration, her total monthly \r\n  expenses (including, inter alia, the mortgage on the marital home, \r\n  $250 for anticipated credit card payments, $300 for anticipated lien payments \r\n  on a new car, and a $789 entertainment expense) amount to about $5,730 per month.Â  \r\n  Consequently, the Family Courtâ€™s award of $4,300 per month to the wife in alimony, \r\n  added to her net monthly income of $2,552, would afford her a monthly income \r\n  of $6,852, thereby exceeding her needs by approximately $1,122 per month.\r\nAlthough Wife established \r\n  entitlement to alimony, the amount of the Family Courtâ€™s award is excessive \r\n  and amounts to an abuse of discretion.Â  Accordingly, I vote to reverse the amount \r\n  of alimony awarded and modify the Family Courtâ€™s order to reduce the award of \r\n  permanent periodic alimony to $3,000 per month.\r\nV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  Fees and Costs\r\nHusband maintains the Family Court erred in ordering him to contribute $52,917.21 \r\n  towards Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  I disagree.\r\nUnder South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2002), \r\n  the judge may order one party to pay a reasonable amount to the other for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs incurred in maintaining an action for divorce.Â  Smith v. Smith, \r\n  327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees will \r\n  not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988); Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322 \r\n  S.C. 7, 471 S.E.2d 154 (1996) (award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is within \r\n  sound discretion of Family Court judge).Â  Before awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the \r\n  Family Court should consider (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own \r\n  fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s \r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992); \r\n  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In determining \r\n  the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider: (1) the nature, \r\n  extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; (2) the time necessarily devoted \r\n  to the case; (3) counselâ€™s professional standing; (4) the contingency of compensation; \r\n  (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar \r\n  services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991); \r\n  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nHere, Husband abandoned the marital home, began an adulterous affair, refused \r\n  to participate in marital counseling in any meaningful way, rejected Wifeâ€™s \r\n  attempts at reconciliation, and decided to commence marital litigation, thereby \r\n  putting Wife to the task of defending against the action.Â  In addition, the \r\n  issues of equitable apportionment and distribution were highly contested at \r\n  trial and, notwithstanding this Courtâ€™s modifications to the Family Courtâ€™s \r\n  order on appeal, Wifeâ€™s attorney obtained several beneficial results on her \r\n  behalf, including an award of divorce on the ground of adultery and an equal \r\n  division of the marital estate.\r\nHaving reviewed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees in light \r\n  of the applicable factors, I conclude the Family Court did not abuse its discretion.Â  \r\n  There is sufficient evidentiary support in the record to uphold the judgeâ€™s \r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI vote to reverse the Family Courtâ€™s order identifying $12,332 in credit card \r\n  charges as marital debt subject to equitable division, and in allocating the \r\n  debt to Husband.Â  Wife made no showing and the record did not reveal that the \r\n  credit card debts Wife incurred during the partiesâ€™ separation were incurred \r\n  for any purpose inuring to the benefit of Husband.Â  Moreover, these credit card \r\n  charges were incurred by Wife subsequent to the filing of marital litigation.Â  \r\n  Thus, the debt should not have been allocated to Husband.\r\nAlthough Wife established entitlement to alimony, the amount of the Family \r\n  Courtâ€™s award is excessive and amounts to an abuse of discretion.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  I vote to reverse the amount of alimony awarded and modify the Family Courtâ€™s \r\n  order to reduce the award of permanent periodic alimony from $4,300 to $3,000 \r\n  per month.\r\nThe court did not err in awarding Wife the marital home in partial realization \r\n  of her share in the marital estate.Â  In addition, the Family Court properly \r\n  ordered Husband to contribute $52,917.21 towards Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs.Â  I vote to affirm the judgeâ€™s rulings regarding the marital home and \r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I vote to affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and modify in part.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The marital estate consisted of the marital home valued at $675,000, \r\n    with equity of $539,349; Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts valued at $844,026; \r\n    Wifeâ€™s retirement account valued at $11,077; and, Husbandâ€™s interest in his \r\n    medical practice valued at $41,000.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  We express no opinion as to whether or not the \r\n    family court could have required Husband to reimburse Wife for some or all \r\n    of these charges as an incident of support.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Husband had already contributed $25,547.50 toward \r\n    Wifeâ€™s fees at the time of trial for a total award of $75,129.21. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3611","title":"State v.

[2] \r\nAfter a jury was selected \r\n  but before it could be sworn, Paris entered a nolo contendere plea to the indictment \r\n  with a recommendation from the State that his sentence not exceed five years \r\n  of â€œactual prison timeâ€ with probation to follow.Â  The trial court determined \r\n  Paris was making the plea freely, voluntarily, and intelligently.Â  It found \r\n  the facts as presented by the State and reflected in Parisâ€™ prior statements \r\n  supported the plea.Â  \r\nWhen questioned by the trial court regarding \r\n  whether he had anything to say to the court, Paris said he knew the crime had \r\n  not happened but was not going to contest the charge because he did not feel \r\n  like putting his child through a trial.Â  Upon hearing this, the trial court \r\n  altered course and told Paris it would not accept his plea after all.Â  Paris \r\n  again told the court he did not wish to contest the charge.Â  The trial court, \r\n  however, held to its position, notwithstanding Paris and his counsel urged the \r\n  court to accept his plea.Â  It refused to accept Parisâ€™ plea because Paris insisted \r\n  on his innocence.Â  The trial court told Paris it would not accept the plea unless \r\n  Paris admitted he committed the crime.Â  Paris would not do so, telling the trial \r\n  court, â€œI couldnâ€™t sit up here and tell you I did do it.â€Â  \r\nThereupon, the jury was sworn, a trial \r\n  was held, and Paris was convicted.Â  The trial court sentenced Paris to ten years \r\n  imprisonment but suspended the sentence upon service by Paris of five years \r\n  imprisonment and five years probation.Â  Paris appeals, claiming the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion when it refused to accept his nolo contendere plea solely \r\n  because he would not admit his guilt.Â  Paris also claims the trial court deprived \r\n  him of the benefit of his bargain with the State because he lost the â€œpossibilityâ€ \r\n  of receiving a lesser sentence.Â  \r\nParis relies upon North Carolina v. \r\n  Alford [3]  and United States v. Gaskins [4]  for the proposition that a trial court commits \r\n  an abuse of discretion when it refuses to accept a defendantâ€™s guilty plea solely \r\n  because the defendant will not admit the alleged facts of the crime.Â  \r\nAs to the Alford case, the Supreme Court \r\n  merely held the Constitution does not prohibit the acceptance of a guilty \r\n  plea despite protestations by the defendant of his or her innocence.Â  The case \r\n  has nothing whatever to do with the rejection of guilty pleas. \r\n  [5] Â  \r\nAs to the Gaskins case, other courts have \r\n  either rejected it outright or declined to follow it. \r\n  [6] Â  We likewise reject it and hold like a majority of the federal circuits \r\n  who have considered the question that a trial court â€œcan indeed reject a guilty \r\n  plea because the defendant protests innocence.â€ [7] Â  As the court pointed out in Bednarski, â€œa conviction \r\n  affects more than the court and the defendant; the public is involved . . . \r\n  . [T]he public might well not understand or accept the fact that a defendant \r\n  who denied his guilt was nonetheless placed in a position of pleading guilty \r\n  and going to jail . . . .â€ [8] \r\nParis argues he â€œlost the bargain offered by the \r\n  State of the possibility of receiving a sentence [of] less than five yearsâ€ \r\n  when the trial court refused to accept his plea.Â  First, the trial court was \r\n  not required to accept the Stateâ€™s recommendation as to the sentence Paris should \r\n  receive. [9] Â  Second, he got \r\n  essentially the same sentence the State had agreed to recommend to the trial \r\n  court, i.e., five years of actual imprisonment followed by probation.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and SHULER, JJ.\r\nconcur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  For all practical purposes, a plea of nolo contendere \r\n    is a plea of guilty in the particular case.Â  State v.

Bailey, Jr., of Summerville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Patrick Jackson was convicted \r\n  of and received concurrent sentences for murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, \r\n  and carjacking. [1] Â  Jackson \r\n  appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPrior to the commencement \r\n  of trial, defense counsel put a motion for recusal on the record, having made \r\n  the original motion in the trial judgeâ€™s chambers.Â  The basis for the motion \r\n  was that the trial judge was the deputy solicitor in Orangeburg County both \r\n  when the crimes were committed and when Jackson was arrested.Â  The judge was \r\n  sworn in two days after Jacksonâ€™s arrest.Â  Defense counsel argued that the judge \r\n  should recuse himself because he had been the â€œchief law enforcement officerâ€ \r\n  for the county during crucial points in the history of the case.Â  The judge \r\n  denied the motion, stating he had no knowledge of the case and had never discussed \r\n  it with anyone from the solicitorâ€™s office or â€œany law enforcement agency.â€\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJackson contends the trial judge erred in denying the motion to \r\n  recuse.Â  We find this contention is without merit.\r\nPursuant to Canon 3(E)(1)(a) of \r\n  Rule 501, SCACR, a judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding \r\n  in which the judgeâ€™s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. \r\n  [2] Â  It is not enough for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege \r\n  bias or prejudice.Â  The party must show some evidence of that bias or prejudice. \r\n  [3] Â  The alleged bias or prejudice must stem from an extra-judicial source \r\n  and result in a decision based on information other than what the judge learned \r\n  from his or her participation in the case as a judge. \r\n  [4] Â  If there is no evidence of judicial bias or prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure \r\n  to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal. \r\n  [5] \r\nThe fact that the trial judge in this \r\n  case was a deputy solicitor at the time Jackson allegedly committed the crime \r\n  did not automatically warrant his recusal from the case without more. [6] Â  The trial judge was unfamiliar with the case \r\n  and had not discussed it, either with employees of the solicitorâ€™s office or \r\n  with any law enforcement agency.Â  Indeed, Jackson offered no proof to the contrary. \r\n  [7] \r\nWe further note the ultimate outcome of the case, \r\n  Jacksonâ€™s conviction, is fully supported by the record. \r\n  [8] Â  Jackson signed a statement in which he admitted:Â  he was present at \r\n  the commission of the crimes, he drove the carjacked vehicle, and he owned a \r\n  green Honda Accord.Â  Jackson also identified one of his co-conspirators in a \r\n  photo lineup.Â  Eyewitness testimony placed Jackson and at least one of his co-conspirators \r\n  in a green Accord.Â  A green Accord was seen trailing the carjacked vehicle.Â  \r\n  Jacksonâ€™s sister also testified that, on the day of the carjacking, she witnessed \r\n  Jackson and one of his co-conspirators walking down the dirt road where the \r\n  carjacked vehicle and the victimâ€™s body were eventually found.Â  Given the strength \r\n  of the evidence offered against Jackson at trial, there is no reason to question \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s impartiality. [9] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there was no error in the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s denial of Jacksonâ€™s motion for recusal. [10] Â  There is no reason to challenge the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s impartiality in this matter because the outcome of the case is supported \r\n  by the record. [11] Â  Accordingly, Jacksonâ€™s convictions and sentences \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and SHULER,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1] Â  Jackson also received a consecutive sentence \r\n    for contempt of court.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] Â  See also Murphy v.

Duncan, of Georgetown, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n GOOLSBY, J.:Â \r\nR.C. McEntire, Jr. \r\n  and Pamela T. McEntire brought this action against Mooregard Exterminating Services, \r\n  Inc., alleging, among other things, the breach of a termite contact.Â  The jury \r\n  found for Mooregard Exterminating.Â  The McEntires filed a post-trial motion, \r\n  seeking a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  They also sought \r\n  a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, alternatively, a new trial.Â  At \r\n  no time during the trial itself did the McEntires move for a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  The trial court granted the McEntires â€œa new trial upon the facts,â€ as a ruling \r\n  pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine is also called.1Â  \r\n  Mooregard Exterminating appeals, contending a party must make a directed verdict \r\n  or similar motion before a trial court can grant a new trial based on the facts.Â  \r\n  We disagree and therefore affirm.2\r\nIn Folkens, the supreme court held \r\n  a trial judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial based on the thirteenth \r\n  juror doctrine will not be disturbed unless the trial judgeâ€™s â€œdecision is wholly \r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusion reached was controlled by an error \r\n  of law.â€3Â  Here, the \r\n  issue raised by Mooregard Exterminating does not question the sufficiency of \r\n  the evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s ruling; rather, it argues his decision \r\n  was controlled by an error of law.\r\nAlthough, as Mooregard Exterminating contends, \r\n  a directed verdict motion is a prerequisite to a motion for judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict4 or for \r\n  a motion for a new trial on the ground that the evidence does not support the \r\n  verdict,5 we know of \r\n  no caseâ€”and Mooregard Exterminating cites none to usâ€”in which either the supreme \r\n  court or the court of appeals, at least since the adoption of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure, has held a trial judge lacks the power to grant a \r\n  new trial upon the facts if the moving party earlier failed to make a directed \r\n  verdict or an equivalent motion.6\r\nThe granting of a new trial upon the facts \r\n  is not the equivalent of granting a directed verdict.7Â  A directed verdict is warranted when \r\n  â€œthe case presents only questions of lawâ€8 \r\n  and â€œshould be allowed only if the evidence would not be legally sufficient \r\n  to sustain a verdict for the opposite party.â€9Â  The question of whether \r\n  the evidence adduced by a party can support a verdict in the partyâ€™s favor is \r\n  a question of law.10Â Â  \r\nOn the other hand, a trial judge may grant \r\n  a new trial upon the facts if the judge determines the verdict â€œis contrary \r\n  to the fair preponderance of the evidence.â€11Â  \r\n  Unlike a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge weighs the evidence under \r\n  the thirteenth juror doctrine12 \r\n  and need not view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party.13Â  \r\n  Moreover, the question of whether to grant a new trial upon the facts is one \r\n  addressed to the discretion of the trial judge.14 \r\n \r\n\r\nBecause the question of whether the evidence \r\n  is legally sufficient to support a verdictâ€”a question of lawâ€”is totally different \r\n  from the question of whether the fair preponderance of the evidence supports \r\n  a verdictâ€”a question involving the exercise of discretionâ€”there is no inconsistency \r\n  in a partyâ€™s failure to move for a directed verdict and a partyâ€™s moving to \r\n  have the verdict set aside as being against the fair preponderance of the evidence.15Â  \r\n  Stated differently, â€œ[i]t may well be that a partyâ€™s evidence makes a case for \r\n  the jury while it is so outweighed by the countervailing evidence that, in the \r\n  exercise of its discretion, the trial court should not hesitate to set aside \r\n  the verdict in his favor.â€16 \r\n \r\n\r\nA motion for a directed verdict or similar motion, \r\n  therefore, was not a prerequisite to a motion to set aside the verdict on the \r\n  ground the verdict was contrary to the fair preponderance of the evidence.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and SHULER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1Â \r\n  Folkens v.

Charleston; Ronnie Alan Sabb, of Kingstree; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.:Â  Jack Hurd \r\n  brought this tort action against Williamsburg County and Williamsburg County \r\n  Transit Authority (collectively referred to as the â€œCountyâ€), alleging damages \r\n  resulting from an automobile-pedestrian collision that occurred when he was \r\n  struck by an automobile after exiting a bus.Â  A jury trial was held and Hurd \r\n  was awarded $675,000 in damages.Â  The verdict was reduced under the mandate \r\n  of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  The County appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHurd boarded the Countyâ€™s bus around 6 \r\n  a.m. on February 1, 1996 to go to work in Myrtle Beach.Â  The bus driver usually \r\n  drove another route, but was substituting for the regular driver that day.Â  \r\n  The bus route starts in the Sand Ridge Community, travels through Highway 261 \r\n  to Highway 24, comes down to Highway 41/51 at Mingoâ€™s crossing, then goes through \r\n  Georgetown and Highway 17 to Myrtle Beach.\r\nOn the morning of the accident, the bus \r\n  driver pulled off onto the shoulder of Highway 41, a two-lane road, after several \r\n  passengers requested he stop there so that they could get breakfast across the \r\n  road at Mingoâ€™s Store.Â  The normal procedure was for the bus driver to stop \r\n  further down at the â€œPark and Ride,â€ which is located on the same side of the \r\n  road as Mingoâ€™s Store.Â  The â€œPark and Rideâ€ was erected by the County to serve \r\n  as a transfer station for riders because of the congestion in the Highway 41 \r\n  area.\r\nAfter several passengers alighted onto \r\n  the shoulder, Hurd, who had been sleeping, awoke and asked the bus driver to \r\n  let him off so that he could also go to Mingoâ€™s store.Â  According to the bus \r\n  driver, he informed Hurd he was going to the â€œPark and Rideâ€ and that Hurd could \r\n  disembark there and go to Mingoâ€™s.Â  Hurd, however, requested to go with the \r\n  other passengers.\r\nHurd exited and walked to the rear of \r\n  the bus.Â  At trial, he claimed he looked to the left and right and did not see \r\n  any vehicles on the highway.Â  He stated he began to cross the highway when the \r\n  bus started to pull away and was at an angle so he could not see to his right.Â  \r\n  Hurd continued across the highway and was struck by a car coming from the opposite \r\n  direction.Â  Hurd asserted:Â  â€œI tried to look around the day that I got hit and \r\n  my view was blocked, thatâ€™s why I go [sic] hit.â€Â  Hurd sustained substantial \r\n  injuries as a result of being hit.\r\nBooker Pressley, a former director of \r\n  the Countyâ€™s transit authority, testified that the â€œPark and Rideâ€ on Highway \r\n  41 was built because of the traffic congestion in the area and concern about \r\n  rider safety.Â  Pressley contended that the transit authority had a policy that \r\n  the drivers were to let the passengers off at the â€œPark and Ride.â€Â  Pressley \r\n  maintained he issued a written warning to the bus driver following the accident \r\n  for failing to discharge the passengers at the â€œPark and Ride.â€Â  At his deposition, \r\n  published to the jury, he declared:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       Q.\r\n       \r\n  After the establishment of the Park &amp; Ride were the drivers advised that \r\n  they werenâ€™t to use the shoulder of the road to discharge passengers anymore, \r\n  that they were to use the Park &amp; Ride?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       We had meetings and the \r\n  meetings were that every driver would meet down at Mingoâ€™s and get down there \r\n  between the time of a quarter to seven and twenty minutes to seven so they could \r\n  make their change of the bus.Â  We also talked about you know, it was [sic] thing \r\n  where we talk about everybody pulling up over there.Â  When we went in there \r\n  that was a woods area.Â  We were able to get a whole side cleaned up to the store \r\n  so the passengers wouldnâ€™t have to cross the road.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Were the drivers told \r\n  not to discharge the passengers on the side of the road after the Park &amp; \r\n  Ride was created?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       I think every driver \r\n  was told, and somehow I think theyâ€”now, if they was [sic] doing it I didnâ€™t \r\n  know anything about it.Â  Because I used to go down there quite a few times and \r\n  monitor that because we have some sites in Williamsburg County thatâ€™s creeping \r\n  fast.Â  What I mean is thereâ€™s a lot of traffic and it comes in until you kind \r\n  of, you know it shoots right up on you.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       You were monitoring this \r\n  area to make sure the drivers werenâ€™t discharging passengers on the side of \r\n  41?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       I monitored all areas, \r\n  Myrtle Beach and all the areas.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n       . . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Is safety a consideration \r\n  when letting a passenger off the bus?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       In what way?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n      &nbsp;Well, again, just like \r\n  I said Mingoâ€™s is one of those little areas that was congested and thatâ€™s why \r\n  we started.Â  What we did was we started a Park &amp; Ride site in the congested \r\n  area first.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Do you agree that the \r\n  different discharge areas involve different risks?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       And would you agree that \r\n  some areas are safer than others?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Would you agree that \r\n  the Park &amp; Ride area established behind Mingoâ€™s store is a safer area to \r\n  discharge passengers than on the side of the highway?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n       . . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Do you have any knowledge \r\n  about accident or fatalities occurring at that intersection?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n      &nbsp;Well, Mingoâ€™s when I \r\n  first started the transit, they had a stop sign there.Â  Since then I think they \r\n  had a coupe [sic] of deaths from, not people with transit, but other just drivers.Â  \r\n  Now they have a blinking red light there.Â  I donâ€™t know what has happened but \r\n  that has always been one of those areas and by me living there I know it because \r\n  itâ€™s an area that serves a lot of log trucks and trucks and if youâ€™re a driver \r\n  a lot of times you see truck and you see one you donâ€™t know how many, or you \r\n  donâ€™t howâ€”you donâ€™tâ€”strike thatâ€”you donâ€™t know whatâ€™s behind it so that was \r\n  one of the areas that I always had a lot of concern about and one of the reasons \r\n  I said that I thought he was blessed so much.Â  When we first went out there \r\n  we started toâ€”we used to let people off on the side and we was [sic] able to \r\n  get that property to get over there.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n      &nbsp;Was that a factor in \r\n  getting the property, were you looking for a safer place to discharge people?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       That was the right place.Â  \r\n  That was the place.Â  That was the ideal place.Â  People wanted to use the store \r\n  and we wanted to have a place where we had a bus coming in from Hemmingway and \r\n  we had a bus coming in from Morrisville and one coming in from Neesmith all \r\n  coming in to the same port.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      . . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n      &nbsp;My question was, did \r\n  he violate a policy of the transit authority by discharging passengers on the \r\n  side of Highway 41 rather than using the Park &amp; Ride?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Well, I guess, like I \r\n  said when we put up the site there was no question about it that the site was \r\n  there for the use of getting us off the road.Â  Because we didnâ€™t just put up \r\n  a site we created a piece of land and went in there and cleaned up that woods \r\n  between the store and the Park and Ride site, itâ€™s clean to that store.Â  We \r\n  brought it over there because we didnâ€™t want people crossing the road.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDr. Robert Roberts, an expert in the field \r\n  of traffic and pedestrian safety design, professed at trial that it was unreasonable \r\n  for the bus driver to debus the passengers on the shoulder of the highway.Â  \r\n  Roberts opined that the â€œPark and Rideâ€ was a safer place for the passengers \r\n  to be let off the bus.Â  The following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Go ahead and give [your \r\n  opinion on whether or not the Park &amp; Ride is a safety device] to me, please \r\n  sir.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, among other things.Â  \r\n  Park &amp; Rides serve a multitude of functions.Â  In other words where thatâ€™s \r\n  precisely what you do, you go park and get on the bus and ride, you have interchanges \r\n  between busses; and theyâ€™re located in such a way that you can make these transfers \r\n  safely.Â  Yes, thatâ€™s a primary concern.Â  When you say a safety device, the answer \r\n  to that is yes, but it is also more than that.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Based upon your review \r\n  of the depositions and the other materials and our personal viewing of the scene, \r\n  do you have an opinion as to why this traffic safety device of the Park &amp; \r\n  Ride was established?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Well it was establishedâ€”this \r\n  particular one?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, sir, this particular \r\n  one.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Based on what Iâ€™ve seen \r\n  it was for their safety.Â  It is a place where you can get on and off the bus, \r\n  transfer from bus to another, transfer from an automobile to a bus, or a bus \r\n  to the automobile and do it safely and have a place to leave your vehicle and \r\n  ride in the convenience of the bus to some particular bus you want to go.Â  Itâ€™s \r\n  done safely, efficiently for everyone concerned.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;. . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Is it your opinion that \r\n  it would be unreasonable for the transit authority to drop off a passenger on \r\n  the side of the road where there is no Park &amp; Ride in place?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       It is done, it could \r\n  be done reasonable.Â  But under the circumstances here I donâ€™t consider it reasonable, \r\n  there is a much better alternative.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       What is the alternative?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       The alternative is the \r\n  Park &amp; Ride which is just a few hundred feet away.Â  You could stop, allow \r\n  your passengers to get off the bus in perfect safety, no problems.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;. . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Dr Roberts, explain to \r\n  the jury under what circumstances it would be reasonable to drop a passenger \r\n  off on the side of the road and under what circumstances it would be unreasonable \r\n  to drop a passenger off on the side of the road.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Well you have to keep \r\n  in mind that this is a rural area where your passengers are going to be getting \r\n  on and off in rural circumstances.Â  So basically what you want is a location \r\n  where you can let the passengers off where hopefully you can get the bus completely \r\n  off the traveled way and still have room for the passengers to get off without \r\n  ending up in a ditch or something of this type.Â  Then the bus can move off, \r\n  allow the passengers, if they need to cross the roadway, a clear unobstructed \r\n  view in either direction so they can cross the road in a location which is reasonably \r\n  convenient for the passengers.Â  And as I say you have to keep in mind that this \r\n  is a rural location.Â  Itâ€™s not like an urban area where youâ€™re dropping people \r\n  off on a curb or a sidewalk.Â  In this particular case I think what makes it \r\n  unreasonable in my thinking is that you have a facility within a few hundred \r\n  feet where you can take your bus completely off the roadway, have it in a protected \r\n  area, where you can have other busses or other vehicles there and passengers \r\n  can get on and off and transact their business safely and conveniently.Â  So \r\n  with the Park &amp; Ride thereÂ  dropping them off on this curbside, not even \r\n  a curbside so to speak, roadside to me does not make any sense whatsoever.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;. . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       . . . Is the side of \r\n  the road, the side of highway 41, safer or less safe than the Park &amp; Ride \r\n  [?]\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bucher:Â  \r\n  Same objection, your honor.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Itâ€™s less safe.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of \r\n  Hurd, finding that Hurd was 42% at fault in causing his injuries and that the \r\n  County was 58% at fault. Â The jury awarded Hurd $675,000 in damages.Â  Following \r\n  the Countyâ€™s post trial motions, the trial court reduced the award of damages \r\n  to $250,000, pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act liability cap.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe County appeals, arguing the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to direct a verdict because Hurd did not establish that \r\n  the County breached any duty, that the Countyâ€™s actions were the proximate cause \r\n  of his injuries, or that the County was more negligent than Hurd.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a ruling on a motion for \r\n  directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  See F &amp; D \r\n  Elec. Contractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc., 350 S.C. 454, 567 S.E.2d \r\n  842 (2002); Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 542 S.E.2d 728 \r\n  (2001); see also Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 566 S.E.2d \r\n  529 (2002) (in ruling on a motion for directed verdict, trial court is required \r\n  to view evidence and inferences which reasonably can be drawn therefrom in light \r\n  most favorable to party opposing motion and to deny motion where either evidence \r\n  yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt).Â  In essence, we \r\n  must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably \r\n  possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.Â  Hanahan v. \r\n  Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997); Bultman v. Barber, \r\n  277 S.C. 5, 281 S.E.2d 791 (1981).\r\nWhen the evidence yields only one inference, a \r\n  directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.Â  Sims v. Giles, \r\n  343 S.C. 708, 541 S.E.2d 857 (Ct. App. 2001); R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. \r\n  Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 540 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  However, if the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable \r\n  inference, the case must be submitted to the jury.Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, \r\n  331 S.C. 589, 503 S.E.2d 717 (1998); Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit \r\n  Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 489 S.E.2d 223 (Ct. App. 1997); see also \r\n  Heyward v. Christmas, ___S.C.___, 573 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 2002) (if \r\n  the evidence is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue \r\n  is created and the court may not grant a directed verdict).\r\nWhen considering directed verdict motions, neither \r\n  the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility \r\n  issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Harvey, \r\n  350 S.C. at 308, 566 S.E.2d at 532; Creech v.

App. 1997).Â  Our \r\n  courts have recognized that when only one reasonable inference can be deduced \r\n  from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for the court.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  A corollary of this rule is that verdicts may not be permitted to rest upon \r\n  surmise, conjecture, or speculation.Â  Id.\r\nIn deciding whether to grant or deny a \r\n  directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence \r\n  or nonexistence of evidence.Â  Long v.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we must review the evidence to determine whether the trial court properly submitted \r\n  the case to the jury.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Breach of Duty\r\nThe County contends \r\n  Hurd failed to present evidence establishing that the County breached any duty \r\n  of safety it owed to Hurd.Â  Particularly, the County alleges that Hurd was unloaded \r\n  in a reasonably safe location.\r\nA common carrier has \r\n  a duty to exercise the highest degree of care towards its passengers. Â Singletary \r\n  v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 217 S.C. 212, 218, 60 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1950); \r\n  Thomas v. Atl. Greyhound Corp., 204 S.C. 247, 252, 29 S.E.2d 196, 198 \r\n  (1944); Poliakoff v. Shelton, 193 S.C. 398, 408, 8 S.E.2d 494, 498 (1940).Â  \r\n  â€œThe relation of passenger and carrier ordinarily ends when the passenger steps \r\n  from a bus into a reasonably safe place on a public highway.â€Â  Flynn v. Carolina \r\n  Scenic Stages, 237 S.C. 340, 345, 117 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1960); see \r\n  14 Am.Jur.2d Carriers Â§ 752 (2000).Â  However, â€œit does not follow that \r\n  the carrier is then wholly discharged of any duty whatsoever to such passenger.Â  \r\n  It still owes him the duty of exercising ordinary care to see that after alighting \r\n  safely he is not in a position or situation as to be imperiled by the starting \r\n  up of the bus.â€Â  Flynn, 237 S.C. at 345, 117 S.E.2d at 366-67.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the question before this Court is whether or not Hurd presented any evidence \r\n  establishing that he was let off the bus in an unreasonably dangerous location.\r\nAt trial, Hurd presented \r\n  testimony from Dr. Roberts establishing that it was unwise for the bus driver \r\n  to allow the passengers to debark the bus on the shoulder of the highway.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the former director of the Countyâ€™s transit authority stated that it was the \r\n  transit authorityâ€™s policy to only let passengers off at the â€œPark and Rideâ€ \r\n  on Highway 41 and that Highway 41 was a congested area.Â  Furthermore, the jury \r\n  could infer from the mere presence of the â€œPark and Rideâ€ in the area that it \r\n  was not safe to allow passengers to exit the bus from the shoulder of the highway.Â  \r\n  Under our standard of review, we find there was evidence presented to the jury \r\n  that the County breached its duty of care to Hurd by allowing him to exit from \r\n  the bus on the shoulder of the highway.\r\nII. Proximate Cause\r\nThe\r\nCounty argues Hurd failed to present any evidence that an act of the County was\r\na proximate cause of his injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a negligence action, \r\n  the plaintiff must prove proximate cause.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. \r\n  375, 426 S.E.2d 802 (1993); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d \r\n  488 (Ct. App. 1998); Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Negligence is not actionable unless it proximately causes \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s injury.Â  Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, \r\n  331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998); Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, \r\n  ___S.C.___, 573 S.E.2d 805 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  It is apodictic that a plaintiff \r\n  may only recover for injuries proximately caused by the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  \r\n  Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 548 S.E.2d 605 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).Â  If one neglects a duty which proximately causes injury to another, recovery \r\n  is warranted.Â  Hodge v. Crafts-Farrow State Hosp., 286 S.C. 437, 334 \r\n  S.E.2d 818 (1985); Vinson, 324 S.C. at 400, 477 S.E.2d at 720.\r\nProximate cause requires proof \r\n  of both causation in fact and legal cause.Â  Oliver v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 309 S.C. 313, 422 S.E.2d 128 (1992); Trivelas \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001); Parks, 345 S.C. at 491, 548 S.E.2d at 609.Â  Causation in fact \r\n  is proved by establishing the plaintiffâ€™s injury would not have occurred â€œbut \r\n  forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Oliver, 309 S.C. at 316, 422 S.E.2d \r\n  at 130; Trivelas, 348 S.C. at 135-36, 558 S.E.2d at 276; Vinson, \r\n  324 S.C. at 400, 477 S.E.2d at 721.\r\nLegal cause, in contrast to the \r\n  â€œbut forâ€ nature of causation in fact, is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  \r\n  Oliver, 309 S.C. at 316, 422 S.E.2d at 131; Small v. Pioneer Mach., \r\n  Inc., 329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d at 842; see also Trivelas, \r\n  348 S.C. at 136, 558 S.E.2d at 276 (legal cause turns on the issue of foreseeability).Â  \r\n  The standard by which foreseeability is determined is that of looking to the \r\n  natural and probable consequences of the complained of act.Â  Oliver, \r\n  309 S.C. at 316, 422 S.E.2d at 131; Young v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. \r\n  453, 242 S.E.2d 671 (1978).\r\nThe touchstone of proximate cause \r\n  in South Carolina is foreseeability.Â  Koester v. Carolina Rental Ctr., Inc., \r\n  313 S.C. 490, 443 S.E.2d 392 (1994);Â  Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist \r\n  Church, 329 S.C. 433, 494 S.E.2d 827 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  An injury is foreseeable \r\n  if it is the natural and probable consequence of a breach of duty.Â  Bergstrom, \r\n  ___S.C. at ___, 573 S.E.2d at 809-10; Trivelas, 348 S.C. at 136, 558 \r\n  S.E.2d at 276; see also Vinson, 324 S.C. at 400, 477 S.E.2d at \r\n  721 (foreseeability is determined by looking to the natural and probable consequences \r\n  of the act complained of).Â  A plaintiff therefore proves legal cause by establishing \r\n  the injury in question occurred as a natural and probable consequence of the \r\n  defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Newton v. South Carolina Pub. Rys. Commâ€™n, 319 \r\n  S.C. 430, 462 S.E.2d 266 (1995); McNair, 330 S.C. at 349, 499 S.E.2d \r\n  at 497; Goode, 329 S.C. at 447, 494 S.E.2d at 834.\r\nA negligent act or omission is \r\n  a proximate cause of injury if, in a natural and continuous sequence of events, \r\n  it produces the injury, and without it, the injury would not have occurred.Â  \r\n  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 401, 477 S.E.2d at 721.Â  In other words, if the accident \r\n  would have happened as a natural and probable consequence, even in the absence \r\n  of the alleged breach, then a plaintiff has failed to demonstrate proximate \r\n  cause.Â  Where the injury complained of is not reasonably foreseeable, there \r\n  is no liability.Â  Crolley v. Hutchins, 300 S.C. 355, 387 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989).Â  In order for conduct to amount to negligence for which compensation \r\n  can be collected, the defendant must have foreseen, or by the exercise of ordinary \r\n  care should have foreseen, the probability that his conduct would likely cause \r\n  injury to another.Â  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 401, 477 S.E.2d at 721.Â  One \r\n  is not charged with foreseeing that which is unpredictable or which would not \r\n  be expected to happen as a natural and probable consequence of the defendantâ€™s \r\n  negligent act.Â  Id.\r\nForeseeability is not \r\n  determined from hindsight, but rather from the defendantâ€™s perspective at the \r\n  time of the alleged breach.Â  Parks, 345 S.C. at 491, 548 S.E.2d at 609; \r\n  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 401, 477 S.E.2d at 721; see also Shepard \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 299 S.C. 370, 385 S.E.2d 35 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989) (foreseeability is to be judged from perspective of defendant at \r\n  time of negligent act, not after injury has occurred).Â  It is not necessary \r\n  for a plaintiff to demonstrate the defendant should have foreseen the particular \r\n  event which occurred but merely that the defendant should have foreseen his \r\n  or her negligence would probably cause injury to someone.Â  Greenville Memâ€™l \r\n  Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 391 S.E.2d 546 (1990); see also \r\n  Bramlette v.

Mahaffey v. Ahl, \r\n  264 S.C. 241, 214 S.E.2d 119 (1975); Small, 329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 843.\r\nâ€œOrdinarily, the question of \r\n  proximate cause is one of fact for the jury and the trial judgeâ€™s sole function \r\n  regarding the issue is to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only \r\n  reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.â€Â  McNair, \r\n  330 S.C. at 349, 499 S.E.2d at 497.Â  Only in rare or exceptional cases may the \r\n  question of proximate cause be decided as a matter of law.Â  Trivelas, \r\n  348 S.C. at 137, 558 S.E.2d at 277; Ballou v.

Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. \r\n  290, 504 S.E.2d 347 (Ct. App 1998); Small, 329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 843.\r\nHurd presented evidence, through \r\n  Pressley and Roberts, that the Countyâ€™s letting Hurd off on the shoulder of \r\n  Highway 41 was a proximate cause of his injury.Â  Specifically, Hurd established \r\n  causation in fact and legal cause, the two elements of proximate cause.Â  Hurd \r\n  demonstrated that the injury would not have happened â€œbut forâ€ the Countyâ€™s \r\n  discharging him on the shoulder of the road instead of at the â€œPark and Ride.â€Â  \r\n  Pressley attested that the â€œPark and Rideâ€ was created so passengers would not \r\n  have to cross the road to go to Mingoâ€™s Store, the drivers were told not to \r\n  unload the passengers on the side of the road after the â€œPark and Rideâ€ was \r\n  created, he monitored the area to make sure the drivers were not alighting passengers \r\n  on the side of the road, and the â€œPark and Rideâ€ was created because it was \r\n  a safer place to discharge passengers than the shoulder of the road.Â  Roberts \r\n  professed that under the circumstances of a â€œPark and Rideâ€ being in place nearby, \r\n  it was unreasonable for the County to drop off passengers on the side of the \r\n  road.Â  Hurd established the requisite foreseeability for legal cause by Pressleyâ€™s \r\n  testimony that the County created the â€œPark &amp; Rideâ€ as a safety measure \r\n  in the congested area.Â  Hurd has, therefore, presented evidence that allows \r\n  one to infer that the Countyâ€™s action was a proximate cause of the accident.\r\nIII.Â  Comparative \r\n  Negligence\r\nThe County argues that Hurd did \r\n  not present any evidence that the Countyâ€™s negligence exceeded Hurdâ€™s negligence.\r\nComparative negligence is the \r\n  law in South Carolina.Â  Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, \r\n  399 S.E.2d 783 (1991).Â  The jury must apportion fault between the plaintiff \r\n  and defendant in a negligence action.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 528 (2000).Â  Under the comparative negligence doctrine, the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  negligence does not automatically bar recovery by the plaintiff as long as the \r\n  plaintiffâ€™s negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.Â  Trivelas \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001); see also Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 561 S.E.2d 597 \r\n  (2002) (under comparative negligence, plaintiffâ€™s contributory negligence does \r\n  not bar recovery unless that negligence exceeds defendantâ€™s).Â  Stated differently, \r\n  a plaintiff may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater than \r\n  that of the defendant.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d 710 \r\n  (2000).Â  The plaintiffâ€™s damages are reduced in proportion to the amount of \r\n  his or her negligence.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 378, 529 S.E.2d at 533.Â  The \r\n  burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish the negligence of the defendant.Â  \r\n  Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 532 S.E.2d 612 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nGenerally, â€œunder a â€˜less than \r\n  or equal toâ€™ comparative negligence rule, determination of respective degrees \r\n  of negligence attributable to the plaintiff and the defendant presents a question \r\n  of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn.â€Â  \r\n  Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 559, 481 S.E.2d 444, 451 (Ct. App. 1997); \r\n  see also Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Res. Depâ€™t, \r\n  328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997) (comparison of a plaintiffâ€™s negligence with \r\n  that of the defendant is a question of fact for the jury to decide).Â  â€œAccordingly, \r\n  apportionment of negligence, which determines both whether a plaintiff is barred \r\n  from recovery or can recover some of his damages and the proportion of damages \r\n  to which he is entitled, is usually a function of the jury.â€Â  Brown, \r\n  325 S.C. at 559, 481 S.E.2d at 451.Â  â€œIn a comparative negligence case, the \r\n  trial court should only determine judgment as a matter of law if the sole reasonable \r\n  inference which may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence \r\n  exceeded fifty percent.â€Â  Bloom, 339 S.C. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 713; \r\n  see also Thomasko, 349 S.C. at 11, 561 S.E.2d at 599 (in comparative \r\n  negligence case, trial court should grant motion for directed verdict if sole \r\n  reasonable inference from evidence is that non-moving partyâ€™s negligence exceeded \r\n  fifty percent).\r\nThe testimony of Pressley is \r\n  overwhelming that the County violated its own safety policy by alighting passengers \r\n  on the shoulder of the road instead of at the â€œPark and Ride.â€Â  Rather than \r\n  discharge the passengers at the â€œPark and Ride,â€ which was constructed to insure \r\n  passenger safety, the driver decided to violate the Countyâ€™s policies and debus \r\n  the passengers on the shoulder of the road.Â Â  In addition, Roberts concluded \r\n  that it was unreasonable and did â€œnot make any sense whatsoeverâ€ to discharge \r\n  passengers on the roadside rather than at the â€œPark and Ride.â€Â  Under the facts \r\n  of this case, we find Hurd presented evidence that allows a jury to draw a reasonable \r\n  inference that the Countyâ€™s negligence was greater than Hurdâ€™s negligence.\r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.\r\nCURETON, J., dissents \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nCURETON, J., dissenting:Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  \r\nI.\r\nThe majority contends that Hurd produced \r\n  sufficient evidence to establish that he was let off the bus in an unreasonably \r\n  dangerous location.Â  I disagree.\r\nAt trial, Hurd offered the deposition of Booker \r\n  Pressley, the former director of Williamsburg Countyâ€™s transit authority.Â  Pressley \r\n  stated that the area in which the â€œPark and Rideâ€ was created was congested.Â  \r\n  Pressley attested that the â€œPark and Rideâ€ was created so that the passengers \r\n  would not have to cross the road to go to Mingoâ€™s store, and it was also established \r\n  to provide the County with a safer place to discharge its passengers than on \r\n  the side of the highway.Â Â  \r\n&nbsp;Hurd also presented testimony from Dr. Roberts, \r\n  an expert in the field of traffic and pedestrian safety design, that it was \r\n  unwise for the bus driver to have allowed passengers to disembark from the bus \r\n  on the shoulder of the highway when there was a â€œPark and Rideâ€ available.Â  \r\n  However, Roberts further opined that it would be reasonable to drop passengers \r\n  off on the side of the road under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n[K]eep in mind that this is a rural area where \r\n  your passengers are going to be getting on and off in rural circumstances.Â  \r\n  So â€¦ what you want is a location where you can let the passengers off where \r\n  hopefully you can get the bus completely off the traveled way and still have \r\n  room for the passengers to get off without ending up in the ditch or something \r\n  of this type.Â  Then the bus can move off, allow the passengers, if they need \r\n  to cross the roadway, a clear unobstructed view in either direction so they \r\n  can cross the road in a location which is reasonably convenient for the passengers.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial Appellant presented evidence which clearly \r\n  showed that the shoulder of the road was adequate in size to allow the bus space \r\n  to pull completely off the roadway while still having adequate room for passengers \r\n  to disembark without stepping into a ditch, etc.Â  The shoulder was also sufficient \r\n  to enable the bus to reenter the roadway, while at the same time allowing the \r\n  passenger to safely stand in the shoulder and view both lanes of traffic so \r\n  that the passenger could then cross the roadway in a reasonably convenient location.Â  \r\n  The majority points to the fact that when the bus moved to reenter the highway, \r\n  the bus was at an angle and Hurd testified he was unable to see to his right.Â  \r\n  However, there is no evidence to show that the bus pulled onto the highway into \r\n  the oncoming lane of traffic traveling from the right and blocked Hurdâ€™s view \r\n  in that manner.Â  \r\nA common carrier has a duty to exercise the highest \r\n  degree of care towards its passengers.Â  Singletary v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. \r\n  Co., 217 S.C. 212, 218, 60 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1950).Â  However, â€œthe relation \r\n  of passenger and carrier ordinarily ends when the passenger steps from a bus \r\n  into a reasonable safe place on a public highway.â€Â  Flynn v. Carolina Scenic \r\n  Stages, 237 S.C. 340, 345, 117 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1960).Â  Accord Harris \r\n  v. Atl. Greyhound Corp., 90 S.E.2d 710, 713 (N.C. 1956) (finding bus company \r\n  owes a passenger duty to provide a safe landing, but once passenger has alighted \r\n  safely to a place of safety, relationship of carrier and passenger ends).\r\nThe extent of Pressley and \r\n  Robertsâ€™s testimony was not that this particular shoulder was unsafe in and \r\n  of itself, but that this shoulder was unreasonably dangerous in light of the \r\n  fact that there was a safer location, a â€œPark and Ride,â€ a few hundred feet \r\n  away.Â  However, the threshold that must be met was that the carrier breached \r\n  a duty to Hurd because the carrier let him off the bus in an unreasonably dangerous \r\n  location. The evidence presented by Hurd does not meet this standard.Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nThe majority found that \r\n  Hurd presented evidence that allowed an inference that the Countyâ€™s actions \r\n  were the proximate cause of the accident and that the countyâ€™s negligence was \r\n  greater than Hurdâ€™s negligence.Â  I disagree.Â Â  \r\nAlthough comparison \r\n  of a plaintiffâ€™s negligence with that of a defendant is ordinarily a question \r\n  for the jury, the trial court should determine this question as a matter of \r\n  law if the â€œsole reasonable inference which may be drawn from the evidence is \r\n  that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.â€Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, \r\n  339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2000).Â  â€œWhere evidence of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  greater negligence is overwhelming, evidence of slight negligence on \r\n  the part of the defendant is simply not enough for a case to go to the jury.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 424, 529 S.E.2d at 714.\r\nHurd testified that he did \r\n  not have a clear view of the highway when he began to cross the street to reach \r\n  Mingoâ€™s store. He stated that he continued to cross the highway even though \r\n  the bus was blocking his ability to see oncoming traffic. Â Rather than \r\n  wait a brief moment on the shoulder for the bus to pull away, Hurd chose to \r\n  cross the highway despite his obstructed view.Â  Furthermore, Hurd requested \r\n  to be let out on the shoulder even though the driver informed him that he was \r\n  driving to the â€œPark and Rideâ€ where Hurd could have safely exited the bus and \r\n  walked to Mingoâ€™s store.Â  Hurdâ€™s own testimony established that he attempted \r\n  to cross the highway in an unreasonable and unsafe manner.Â Â  \r\n\r\nA common carrier of passengers is due such passengers the \r\n  highest degree of care, but is not an insurer of the safety of passengers under \r\n  all circumstances. â€¦ In an action in tort based on negligence, the negligence \r\n  of the defendant must be the proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff.Â  \r\n  Even though there may be some testimony from which it could be inferred that \r\n  a defendant was negligent, a plaintiff cannot unnecessarily and consciously \r\n  take a risk which may or may not result in injury, and when it does result in \r\n  injury, then recover damages therefor against a defendant.Â  In other words, \r\n  the law requires that a passenger . . . should use every reasonable care to \r\n  avoid injury to himself, and if he fails to use such care as a man of ordinary \r\n  prudence and caution would have used under the surrounding circumstances, and \r\n  is injured as a result thereof, he cannot recover.Â  \r\n\r\nSingletary,Â  217 S.C. atÂ  218-19, 60 S.E.2d at 307-308 \r\n  (1950).Â  Under the facts of this case, I find that Hurd failed to present evidence \r\n  that the carrierâ€™s negligence was the proximate cause of his injuries or that \r\n  the Countyâ€™s negligence was greater than his own.Â  Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of the County.Â  \r\nI would REVERSE and enter \r\n  judgment for Appellant.Â  \r\n    Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3615","title":"State v.

Haile, of Columbia; \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  allÂ  of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Darnell East was indicted for armed robbery \r\n  and seven counts of kidnapping.Â  The trial judge denied his motions for a directed \r\n  verdict on the charges of kidnapping. East was convicted on all counts and sentenced \r\n  to life without parole.Â Â  East appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in denying \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict on the kidnapping charges because the alleged \r\n  kidnapping was not a separate and distinct offense from the armed robbery.Â  \r\n  He also contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a directed \r\n  verdict on the kidnapping charge as to Richard Ausburn because Ausburn did not \r\n  testify at trial.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nI. FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nTwo men entered a fast-food restaurant in Powdersville \r\n  shortly before it opened on a Sunday morning.Â  One of the men had a knife and \r\n  said:Â  â€œThis is a robbery.â€Â  When the employee advised him that he did not have \r\n  the key to open the cash drawer, the robber with the knife and the employee \r\n  walked to the managerâ€™s office. The manager came to the door of the office, \r\n  and the robber grabbed the phone from the manager and cut the cord with the \r\n  knife.Â  Shortly thereafter, the other robber, East, came back to the managerâ€™s \r\n  office carrying a gun.Â  East grabbed the manager and took him into the office.Â  \r\n  When East came out of the office with the manager, the two robbers told seven \r\n  of the employees to â€œlay (sic) on the ground.â€Â  The employees lay there for \r\n  several minutes until the robbers left the store.Â  Approximately twenty-three \r\n  hundred dollars was stolen from the store.Â  \r\nAt trial, the defense moved for a directed verdict \r\n  on the ground that the brief confinement of the victims during the course of \r\n  the armed robbery was not a separate and distinct offense.Â  A directed verdict \r\n  was also sought on the kidnapping charge as to one of the employees, Richard \r\n  Ausburn, because Ausburn â€œdid not appear and has not testified.â€ Relying primarily \r\n  on the case of State v. Hall, 280 S.C. 74, 310 S.E.2d 429 (1983), the \r\n  trial judge denied the motion for a directed verdict.Â  He also found the testimony \r\n  of other employees concerning Ausburnâ€™s presence during the robbery to be sufficient \r\n  to warrant a denial of the motion for a directed verdict as to that count of \r\n  kidnapping.Â  The jury convicted East of all charges.\r\nII. ISSUE\r\nEast argues he was entitled to a directed verdict on the kidnapping charges \r\n  because the brief confinement of the employees during the course of the armed \r\n  robbery was not sufficient to constitute the separate crime of kidnapping.Â  \r\n  East also argues he was entitled to a directed verdict on the kidnapping count \r\n  with respect to Richard Ausburn because Ausburn did not appear at trial and \r\n  did not testify.\r\nIII. DISCUSSION\r\nS.C. Code Â§16-3-910 (Supp. 2001) defines the offense \r\n  of kidnapping as follows:Â  â€œWhoever shall unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, \r\n  decoy, kidnap, abduct or carry away any other person by any means whatsoever \r\n  without authority of law, except when a minor is seized or taken by his parent, \r\n  is guilty of a felony . . . .â€Â  Kidnapping is a continuous offense which â€œcommences \r\n  when one is wrongfully deprived of freedom and continues until freedom is restored.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 13, 512 S.E.2d 99, 105 (1999).Â  South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  kidnapping statute requires proof of an unlawful act taking one of several alternative \r\n  forms, including seizure, confinement, inveiglement, decoy, kidnapping, \r\n  [2]  abduction, or carrying away. See State v. Owens, 291 \r\n  S.C. 116, 352 S.E.2d 474 (1987).Â  \r\nThe issue of whether the act of confinement can \r\n  constitute the separate offense of kidnapping when it is incidental to the commission \r\n  of another crime was raised in State v. Hall, 280 S.C. 74, 310 S.E.2d \r\n  429 (1983).Â  In Hall, the victim was abducted by knifepoint as she placed \r\n  a call from a phone booth near a clubhouse of an apartment complex.Â  The perpetrator \r\n  forced the victim to walk to an adjacent pool area where he sexually assaulted \r\n  her and forced her to walk to different locations around the pool.Â  At each \r\n  location, the victim was assaulted.Â  On appeal from his convictions for assault \r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature, first degree criminal sexual conduct, \r\n  and kidnapping, Hall argued the trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury \r\n  that in order to establish kidnapping, the State must prove the confining and \r\n  carrying away of the victim was more than incident to the commission of another \r\n  crime.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court disagreed, holding that Hallâ€™s restraint \r\n  of the victim constituted kidnapping within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-3-910 (1976) â€œregardless of the fact that the purpose of this seizure was \r\n  to facilitate the commission of a sexual battery.â€Â  280 S.C. at 78, 310 S.E.2d \r\n  at 431.Â  \r\nIt appears that South Carolina may be in the minority \r\n  of jurisdictions which have considered this issue.Â  See State v. Anthony, \r\n  817 S.W.2d 299, 305 (Tenn. 1991) (citing to at least fifteen statesâ€™ appellate \r\n  court decisions on this issue and stating that â€œ[b]y an overwhelming margin, \r\n  the majority view in other jurisdictions is that kidnapping statutes do not \r\n  apply to unlawful confinements or movements incidental to the commission of \r\n  other crimes.â€); see also Model Penal Code Â§ 212.1 (2001) (requiring \r\n  movement over a substantial distance or confinement for a substantial period \r\n  of time).Â  Nevertheless, we agree with the trial judge here that the decision \r\n  of our supreme court in State v. Hall controls.\r\nMoreover, we note that the trial judge charged \r\n  the jury that in order for it to convict East of both offenses, it must find \r\n  that he had the requisite intent to commit two separate offenses.Â  Although \r\n  the jury charge is not part of the record on appeal, the trial judge advised \r\n  counsel when he placed the results of the charge conference on the record and \r\n  stated:Â  \r\n\r\nI am going to follow the lead of [defense counsel] in her \r\n  request from that Hall case that cites with approval the North Carolina \r\n  decision that in order to convict on the second series of offenses, the alleged \r\n  kidnappings, Iâ€™m going to quote from that case and make that charge.Â  And for \r\n  the record, it will be as follows:Â  â€œUnder the law, two or more criminal offenses \r\n  may grow out of the same course of action as where one offense is committed \r\n  with the intent thereafter to commit the other and is actually followed by the \r\n  commission of the other.â€\r\n\r\nThus, the jury was clearly instructed that in order \r\n  to convict East of both armed robbery and kidnapping, it would have to find \r\n  that he possessed the requisite intent to commit the second offense, in this \r\n  case, the kidnapping.\r\nRegarding Eastâ€™s argument concerning the failure \r\n  of the State to call one of the victims as a witness, there was testimony in \r\n  the record from the other KFC employees that Ausburn was present when they were \r\n  confined in the hallway.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge properly denied the motion \r\n  for a directed verdict on this ground.Â  See State v. Charping, \r\n  333 S.C. 124, 129, 508 s.E.2d 851, 854 (1998) (â€œ[A]n adverse inference from \r\n  the unexplained failure of a party to call an available witness is generally \r\n  held not warranted when the material facts assumed to be within the knowledge \r\n  of the absent witness have been testified to by other qualified witnesses.â€);Â  \r\n  State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 82-83, 441 S.E.2d 635, 638 (Ct. App. 1994) \r\n  (â€œIn reviewing the refusal to grant a directed verdict, the evidence is viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the State to determine whether there is any evidence, \r\n  either direct or circumstantial, which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of \r\n  the accused, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.â€)\r\nAccordingly, Eastâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHULER, JJ. concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\n  SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]    â€œAs used in Â§ 16-3-910, the term â€˜kidnapâ€™ apparently refers \r\n    to the common law crime of kidnapping.â€Â  State v.

water heater at a Greenville Housing Authority \r\n  (GHA) property, appeals the jury verdict in GHAâ€™s favor.Â  Scott argues the trial \r\n  judge erred by refusing to hold GHA admitted liability pursuant to Rule 36, \r\n  SCRCP.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn February 7, 1998, Scott left his son, three-year-old Zacharias \r\n  Scott, with a babysitter in unit 62-A of Pierce Homes.Â  Pierce Homes is a property \r\n  owned and operated by GHA.Â  After going to the bathroom, Zacharias attempted \r\n  to wash his hands.Â  The water was so hot that it caused severe burns to his \r\n  hands.Â  Zacharias spent ten days in the hospital for his painful burns, which \r\n  required him to be placed under anesthesia prior to changing his bandages.Â  \r\n  Over the next two years, Zacharias underwent several surgeries to improve the \r\n  appearance and range of motion in his hands.Â  Despite the surgeries, Zachariasâ€™ \r\n  hands were severely scarred and he incurred more than $23,000 in medical bills.\r\nOn January 4, 2000, Scott, on behalf of Zacharias, sued GHA, alleging \r\n  GHA was aware the hot water heater was improperly set and that GHAâ€™s grossly \r\n  negligent and reckless acts proximately caused Zachariasâ€™ injuries.Â  Scott sought \r\n  actual and punitive damages.Â  GHA denied liability and asserted that Scott was \r\n  responsible for the injuries for failing to properly supervise Zacharias and \r\n  Zacharias assumed the risk of burns by using only hot water to wash his hands.\r\nThe parties proceeded with discovery.Â  On November 15, 2000, Scott \r\n  served GHA with Supplemental Interrogatories and Requests for Production, requesting, \r\n  among other things, inspection records for the hot water heaters.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  on November 21, 2000, Scott served GHA with a First Set of Requests for Admission \r\n  and Supplemental Interrogatories.Â  Request to Admit numbers 3 and 4 asked GHA \r\n  to admit that it was responsible and liable for all of Zachariasâ€™ damages, and \r\n  that its conduct was the sole proximate cause of any and all damages he suffered.Â  \r\n  The remaining requests asked GHA to admit that it had a duty to inspect the \r\n  hot water heater to unit 62-A and whether GHA had performed such an inspection \r\n  in the year prior to the incident.Â  GHA did not respond to either discovery \r\n  request within thirty days.Â  Further, GHA only responded to the Supplemental \r\n  Interrogatories and Request to Produce on February 5, 2001, two days before \r\n  the matter was scheduled for trial.Â  GHA did not produce the inspection records \r\n  for the hot water heaters and never responded to the Requests for Admission.\r\nThe matter was initially scheduled for trial on February 7, 2001.Â  \r\n  During the pretrial hearing, Scott moved to have GHAâ€™s lack of response to the \r\n  Requests for Admission deemed an admission of liability and proximate cause \r\n  of Zachariasâ€™ injuries pursuant to Rule 36, SCRCP, so that the trial could continue \r\n  only as to damages.Â  GHA moved to withdraw the admissions for lack of response, \r\n  averring Scott was on notice that GHA denied liability in the matter because \r\n  it moved for summary judgment, it denied liability in its answer, and it pled \r\n  contributory negligence and assumption of the risk as affirmative defenses.Â  \r\n  GHA alleged that, because the deemed admission of liability was at the crux \r\n  of the case, not regarding a tangential fact, the presentation of the merits \r\n  would be subserved by allowing the admissions to be withdrawn and Scott would \r\n  suffer no prejudice in having to prove liability.\r\nScott claimed that, because GHA refused to comply with any of his discovery \r\n  requests, he did not have the inspection records necessary to prepare his case.Â  \r\n  Thus, he would be prejudiced and presentation of the merits would not be subserved \r\n  thereby if GHA were allowed to withdraw their admission of liability.Â  Scott \r\n  admitted he did not file a motion to compel after GHA failed to respond to the \r\n  requests for admissions because the issue of liability was deemed admitted under \r\n  the rule.Â  GHA argued that it had given Scott all the information and records \r\n  that were available.\r\nThe trial court struck GHAâ€™s admissions numbers 3 and 4 regarding liability \r\n  and negligence.Â  The court found Scott made similar allegations in his complaint \r\n  and that GHA had denied liability and negligence in its answer.Â  The court was \r\n  concerned that â€œin every case, then, after issues are joined by pleadings that \r\n  one or both of the parties will again plead the case by asking for admissions, \r\n  and we will have a never-ending pleading circumstance by requests for admissions \r\n  going back and forth between the parties.â€Â  The court noted that the Tort Claims \r\n  Act requires gross negligence and an admission of liability does not admit gross \r\n  negligence.Â  In the written order, the court stated â€œthe requests to admit \r\n  are superfluous to the issues joined in the pleadings and specifically pled \r\n  in the Plaintiffâ€™s complaint and specifically denied by affirmative defenses \r\n  in Defendantâ€™s answer.â€Â  The trial court continued the trial to allow \r\n  Scott to file motions to compel and for GHA to provide Scott with discovery.\r\nScott filed a motion for reconsideration of the matter.Â  The court denied the \r\n  motion, holding that â€œwhen issues of fact are joined by answer to the \r\n  complaint denying assertions in the complaint, then no subsequent failure to \r\n  respond to discovery as permitted by the Rules of this Court may supercede [sic] \r\n  and negate those ultimate issues of fact in controversy which are presented \r\n  by the fundamental pleadings of the parties in the cause before the Court.â€\r\nScott moved to compel production of GHAâ€™s records concerning the \r\n  hot water heater.Â  On March 20, 2001, the trial court ordered the production \r\n  of records and affidavits regarding the search for records within fourteen days.Â  \r\n  GHA failed to produce any documents within the prescribed time period.Â  Scott \r\n  moved for sanctions for failure to produce the records on April 3, 2001.\r\nOn April 9, 2001, GHA filed the affidavit of U.S. Sweeney, Public \r\n  Housing Coordinator, in which Sweeney declared he gave his attorney all of the \r\n  documents concerning the hot water heaters.Â  Thereafter, GHA provided copies \r\n  of inspection records for the last two inspections of the hot water heaters \r\n  on April 1, 1997, and May 12, 1998.Â  GHA failed to provide requested information \r\n  regarding other inspections or the purchase, manufacture, maintenance, warranty, \r\n  or any other requested information regarding the hot water heater.\r\nThe matter was rescheduled for trial on April 23, 2001.Â  During the \r\n  trial, Sweeney testified that more records regarding the hot water heaters were \r\n  available.Â  During the lunch break, Sweeney obtained two file folders containing \r\n  numerous inspection documents.Â  The trial court granted Scottâ€™s motion for a \r\n  mistrial.\r\nScott filed a second motion for sanctions for contempt of court and \r\n  failure to participate in discovery.Â  Because GHA had repeatedly denied the \r\n  existence of the hot water heater records which were readily available, Scott \r\n  requested that the portion of GHAâ€™s answer in which they denied knowledge of \r\n  the faulty hot water heaters be struck and that GHA pay Scottâ€™s trial preparation \r\n  costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The trial court granted Scottâ€™s motion for sanctions \r\n  as to the trial preparation costs and attorneyâ€™s fees, but the court denied \r\n  Scottâ€™s request to strike GHAâ€™s denial of knowledge regarding the hot water \r\n  heaters. \r\nThe case finally went to trial on May 24, 2001.Â  The jury found for \r\n  GHA.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the

Atkins, \r\n  333 S.C. 345, 509 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 1998) (in action at law on appeal of \r\n  case tried by jury, jurisdiction of Court of Appeals extends merely to correction \r\n  of errors of law, and factual finding of jury will not be disturbed unless review \r\n  of record discloses there is no evidence which reasonably supports juryâ€™s findings).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nScott contends the trial court abused its discretion in allowing \r\n  GHA to withdraw its deemed admission because: (1) the court erred in ruling \r\n  that a defendant cannot make an admission that is contrary to denials contained \r\n  in the answer; (2) the court ignored the requirements for admissions and denials \r\n  as set forth in Rule 36(a), SCRCP; (3) the court failed to follow the requirements \r\n  of Rule 36(b), SCRCP, in evaluating GHAâ€™s motion to withdraw the admissions; \r\n  and (4) the courtâ€™s ruling is inconsistent with the â€œform and substanceâ€ of \r\n  Rule 36.Â  We agree.\r\nI.Â  ADMISSIONS PURSUANT TO RULE 36(a), \r\n  SCRCP\r\nThe trial court in the underlying case based its ruling, in part, \r\n  on the fact that any admission pursuant to Rule 36(a) would be in direct conflict \r\n  with GHAâ€™s answers in its pleadings and went to the ultimate question of liability.Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;Whether as previously embodied in prior South Carolina Circuit Court \r\n  Rule 89 or as currently verbalized in Rule 36, SCRCP, South Carolina has long \r\n  had the discovery rule that failure to respond to requests for admissions renders \r\n  any matter listed in the request conclusively admitted for trial.Â  Rule 36(a) [1]  provides that matters for which \r\n  admissions are requested will be deemed admitted â€œunless, within 30 days \r\n  after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court \r\n  may allow[,] . . . the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the \r\n  party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the \r\n  matter . . . .â€\r\nIn reviewing the tenets of Rule 36(a), our courts have repeatedly \r\n  found that failure to respond to requests for admissions deems matters contained \r\n  therein admitted for trial, regardless of whether the admission concerns a matter \r\n  responded to in a partyâ€™s pleadings.Â  In Hatchell v. Jackson, 290 S.C. \r\n  256, 349 S.E.2d 407 (Ct. App. 1986), Hatchell sued Jackson for fraud and deceit \r\n  in connection with the sale of a restaurant.Â  Jackson counterclaimed for breach \r\n  of contract.Â  In his reply to Jacksonâ€™s counterclaim, Hatchell denied he committed \r\n  a breach of contract, but he failed to respond to Jacksonâ€™s request for admissions.Â  \r\n  The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of Jackson.Â  The Court of \r\n  Appeals articulated:\r\n\r\nHatchell never responded to Jacksonâ€™s request for admissions; \r\n  therefore, under South Carolina Circuit Court Rule 89(a), which was then in \r\n  effect and is now embodied in Rule 36(a) of the new South Carolina Rules of \r\n  Civil Procedure, each matter of which Jackson sought an admission was deemed \r\n  admitted.\r\nBased upon the admissions on file, Jackson moved for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  She maintained the pleadings and admissions on file showed that there \r\n  was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that she was entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law on both Hatchellâ€™s claim and her own.\r\n\r\nHatchell, 290 S.C. at 258, 349 S.E.2d at 408.Â  Because genuine issues \r\n  of material fact still existed even after matters were deemed admitted due to \r\n  Hatchellâ€™s failure to respond to the request, this Court held the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment and reversed.Â  Id. at 259, 349 S.E.2d \r\n  at 408.\r\nA majority of the Supreme Court, in Hinson-Barr, Inc. v. Pinckard, 292 \r\n  S.C. 267, 356 S.E.2d 115 (1987), concluded that a seller of restaurant equipment \r\n  was not entitled to summary judgment in its action for breach of contract against \r\n  a buyer.Â  The dissent, however, pointed out that the buyer failed to respond \r\n  to the requests for admission:\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 36(a), SCRCP, all matters contained in a Request \r\n  for Admission are admitted unless the party serves answers or objects within \r\n  a certain time.Â  It is undisputed that [B]uyer never responded to Sellerâ€™s second \r\n  Request for Admissions served on February 28, 1985.Â  By its failure to act, \r\n  Buyer admitted: (1) that it â€œaccepted the equipment and goods supplied by [Seller] \r\n  as reflected in the invoices . . .â€; (2) the genuineness of and its acceptance \r\n  of the invoices and ledger sheets; and (3) that it resold these goods to a third \r\n  party.Â  These facts are conclusively admitted for the purposes of this litigation \r\n  since Buyer made no motion to withdraw or amend them.Â  Rule 36(b), SCRCP.\r\n\r\nHinson-Barr, 292 S.C. at 269-70, 356 S.E.2d at 116-17 \r\n  (Ness, C.J., dissenting) (footnote omitted); see also Bakala v. Bakala, \r\n  Op. No. 25586 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 27, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 \r\n  at 12) (â€œHusband did not respond to Wifeâ€™s request to admit that his interest \r\n  in Hartig had a value of $300,000 and this fact is therefore deemed admitted \r\n  under Rule 36(a), SCRCP.â€).\r\nMore recently, the Court of Appeals addressed the binding effect \r\n  of admissions due to a failure to respond to the requests to admit.Â  In Commerce \r\n  Center of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 \r\n  S.C. 545, 556 S.E.2d 718 (Ct. App. 2001), a building owner brought an action \r\n  against an architect and a contractor for damages due to leaky windows.Â  The \r\n  building owner responded to the requests for admissions, but the owner specifically \r\n  reserved the right to supplement the response.Â  In reviewing the Circuit Courtâ€™s \r\n  refusal to allow the contractor to present copies of the admissions to the jury \r\n  while granting the ownerâ€™s request to amend the admissions, this Court determined \r\n  that admissions obtained via a failure to respond to a request to admit were \r\n  just as binding on a party as answers in pleadings or stipulations, absent \r\n  the grant of an amendment to the admissions:\r\n\r\nA party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, \r\n  for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters within \r\n  the general rules of discovery that relate to statements or opinions of fact \r\n  or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents \r\n  described in the request.Â  Rule 36(a), SCRCP.Â  The efficacy of these admissions \r\n  is akin to the doctrine of judicial estoppel: an admission precludes the admitting \r\n  party from arguing facts at trial contrary to its responses to a request to \r\n  admit, absent an amendment to or revocation of the admission as allowed under \r\n  the rules.Â  See Rule 36(b), SCRCP (â€œAny matter admitted under this rule \r\n  is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or \r\n  amendment of the admission.â€); cf. Adams v. Orr, 260 S.C. 92, \r\n  194 S.E.2d 232 (1973) (affirming trial judgeâ€™s refusal to hold that plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  lack of responses to several of defendantâ€™s requests to admit were admitted \r\n  as binding fact because the requests to admit, as worded, were ambiguous and \r\n  subject to more than one reasonable interpretation).\r\nAdmissions under Rule 36 are treated as admissions in pleadings.Â  Muller \r\n  v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 399 S.E.2d 430 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. \r\n  v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000); see also \r\n  James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 304 (1996) (â€œAdmissions \r\n  are similar to pleadings.â€); Pulte Home Corp. v. Woodland Nursery &amp; Landscapes, \r\n  Inc., 230 Ga. App. 455, 496 S.E.2d 546, 548 (1998) (â€œIn form and substance \r\n  [a response to a request to admit] is comparable to an admission in pleadings \r\n  or stipulation of facts and as such is generally regarded as a judicial admission \r\n  rather than evidentiary admission of a party.â€).\r\n\r\nCommerce Ctr., 347 S.C. at 554-55, 556 S.E.2d at 723 (footnote omitted).Â  \r\n  Although the Court found the Requests for Admissions were just as binding as \r\n  pleadings on the parties, it further ruled the Circuit Court was correct in \r\n  refusing to submit the admissions to the jury because, pursuant to Rule 43, \r\n  SCRCP, â€œâ€˜pleadings shall not be submitted to the jury for its deliberations.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 555, 556 S.E.2d at 723 (quoting Rule 43(g), SCRCP).Â  Thus, in \r\n  our state, requests to admit are not submitted to the jury; rather, the proper \r\n  course of action is to publish the admissions to the jury.Â  Id.\r\nThe federal rule on requests for admissions is substantively similar \r\n  to our rule.Â  According to Rule 36(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \r\n  matters for which an admission is sought shall be deemed admitted unless â€œthe \r\n  party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission \r\n  a written answer or objection addressed to the matter . . . .â€Â  Rule 36(a), \r\n  FRCP.Â  The purpose of the rule is to save time and to limit the issues in the \r\n  case:\r\n\r\n[The ruleâ€™s] function is to define and limit the matters \r\n  in controversy between the parties.\r\n  \r\nThrough such definition and limitation, admissions promote both efficiency and \r\n  economy in resolving disputes.Â  If a point is conceded, litigants need not expend \r\n  effort in investigations concerning it nor incur expense in presenting evidence \r\n  to prove it.Â  Judicial administration is also aided.Â  Admissions reduce the \r\n  time required to try a case.Â  Indeed, they often make summary judgment possible.Â  \r\n  Finally, admissions encourage litigants to evaluate realistically the hazards \r\n  of trial, and thus tend to promote settlements.\r\n  \r\nThe rule is intended to expedite the trial and to relieve \r\n  the parties of the cost of proving facts that will not be disputed at trial, \r\n  the truth of which is known to the parties or can be ascertained by reasonable \r\n  inquiry. \r\n\r\n8A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \r\n  Â§ 2252 (2d ed. 1994) (footnotes omitted); see also Langer v. Monarch \r\n  Life Ins. Co., 966 F.2d 786, 803 (3d Cir. 1992) (â€œRule 36 serves two vital \r\n  purposes, both of which are designed to reduce trial time.Â  Admissions are sought, \r\n  first to facilitate proof with respect to issues that cannot be eliminated from \r\n  the case, and secondly, to narrow the issues by eliminating those that can be.â€).\r\nSome federal courts have held that requests for admissions are not \r\n  objectionable merely because they go to ultimate facts or other issues that \r\n  must be proven by the plaintiff.Â  See, e.g., Cereghino v. Boeing Co., \r\n  873 F. Supp. 398, 403 (D. Or. 1994) (holding â€œa request for admission under \r\n  Rule 36, and a resultant admission, are not improper merely because they . . \r\n  . relate to an â€˜ultimate fact,â€™ or prove dispositive of the entire case.â€).\r\nThe trial judge in the present case erred as a matter of law in finding \r\n  the admissions made as a result of GHAâ€™s failure to respond to Scottâ€™s requests \r\n  for admissions were not binding because the admissions would conflict with GHAâ€™s \r\n  answers in its pleadings.Â  The purpose of Rule 36 is to allow parties to narrow \r\n  the issues and determine which facts do not need to be proven because they are \r\n  admitted.Â  Rule 36(a) does not condition the binding effect of requests for \r\n  admissions upon whether the requests address issues asserted or denied in the \r\n  pleadings.Â  Whether a request to admit alters the pleadings depends on the language \r\n  of the particular request to admit.Â  However, if the language of the request \r\n  for admission specifically goes to an issue in the pleadings, the admission \r\n  resulting from a partyâ€™s failure to respond to the request may override the \r\n  pleadings.Â  Despite GHAâ€™s denial of liability and negligence in its pleadings, \r\n  its failure to respond to Scottâ€™s requests for admissions concerning these issues \r\n  was binding upon it.\r\nThis record exemplifies a paradigm of contumacy and intransigence \r\n  in the discovery arena.Â  A review of the record does not reveal a paucity \r\n  or a modicum of response.Â  The activity by GHA demonstrates a nihility in the \r\n  discovery activity.\r\nConcomitantly, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that the ultimate issue \r\n  could not be determined by the admission because it was â€œsuperfluousâ€ to the \r\n  pleadings.Â  \r\nII.Â  AMENDMENT OF ADMISSIONS -- RULE \r\n  36(b), SCRCP\r\nWe now turn to whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing \r\n  GHA to withdraw its admissions.\r\nRule 36(b) delineates the effect of any admission:\r\n\r\nAny matter admitted under this rule is conclusively \r\n  established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment \r\n  of the admission.Â  Subject to the provisions of Rule 16 governing amendment \r\n  of a pre-trial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the \r\n  presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party \r\n  who obtained the admissions fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment \r\n  will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.Â  Any \r\n  admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending \r\n  action only and is not an admission by him for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nRule 36(b), SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  Therefore, a trial court â€œmay allow a \r\n  party to amend or withdraw its answers to a request to admit when: (1) the presentation \r\n  of the merits is furthered by the amendment; and (2) the party who obtained \r\n  the admission cannot demonstrate prejudice because of the amendment.â€Â  Commerce \r\n  Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 \r\n  S.C. 545, 557, 556 S.E.2d 718, 724 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Tuomey \r\n  Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. McIntosh, 315 S.C. 189, 191, 432 S.E.2d 485, 487 \r\n  (1985) (â€œRule 36, SCRCP allows amendment of an admission in the discretion of \r\n  the court when â€˜the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party \r\n  who obtained the admissions fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment \r\n  will prejudice him . . . .â€™â€).Â  Federal Rule 36(b), FRCP, similarly provides \r\n  that â€œthe court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of \r\n  the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained \r\n  the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice \r\n  that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits.â€\r\nIn the instant case, GHA argued that it should be allowed to withdraw \r\n  the admission resulting from its lack of response because it â€œaffirmatively \r\n  denied those specific admissions . . . in the answer . . . and [it] moved for \r\n  summary judgment . . . .â€Â  GHA asserted Scott would not suffer any prejudice \r\n  because â€œat any time during this case [Scott] would never have relied upon the \r\n  fact that we would admit liabilityâ€ due to GHAâ€™s denial in the pleadings.Â  Scott \r\n  alleged that the merits would not be subserved by letting GHA out of its admissions.Â  \r\n  Because of GHAâ€™s refusal to cooperate with discovery requests, Scott claimed \r\n  he would be severely prejudiced.Â  In ruling on the matter, the trial court never \r\n  addressed whether Scott would be prejudiced by the withdrawal of the admissions.Â  \r\n  The court merely focused on the problems that might occur if requests for admissions \r\n  were allowed to negate denials in pleadings.\r\nThe gist and gravamen of the discovery rules mandate full and fair \r\n  disclosure to prevent a trial from becoming a guessing game or one of ambush \r\n  for either party.Â  See State Hwy. Depâ€™t v. Booker, 260 S.C. 245, \r\n  195 S.E.2d 615 (1973); Hodge v. Myers, 255 S.C. 542, 180 S.E.2d 203 (1971).Â  \r\n  Essentially, the rights of discovery articulated by the rules give the attorney \r\n  the means to prepare for trial.\r\nDiscovery is the quintessence of preparation for trial and, when \r\n  discovery rights are trampled, prejudice must be presumed.Â  See Downey \r\n  v. Dixon, 294 S.C. 42, 362 S.E.2d 317 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Unless the party \r\n  who has failed to submit to discovery can show lack of prejudice, reversal is \r\n  mandated.Â  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 495 S.E.2d 213 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe judge erred in failing to address the prejudice that would be \r\n  suffered by Scott.Â  Further, it is evident from the record that Scott was prejudiced \r\n  by the withdrawal of the admission.Â  GHA either denied the existence of or did \r\n  not provide Scott with discovery records it clearly had access to prior to the \r\n  first date the trial was scheduled.Â  Scott needed the discovery, which was solely \r\n  within the control of GHA, in order to prove his case.Â  After the trial court \r\n  allowed GHA to withdraw its admissions, GHA continued to frustrate Scottâ€™s ability \r\n  to present his case by first denying the existence of the hot water heater records \r\n  and then surprising Scott with the records during the middle of trial.Â  The \r\n  trial court erred in failing to find that Scott was prejudiced.Â  We conclude \r\n  the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in allowing the withdrawal \r\n  of the admissions in this case.\r\nFurthermore, we note the trial court had the option to completely strike GHAâ€™s \r\n  pleadings in the matter as a sanction for its failure to cooperate in discovery.Â  \r\n  See Rule 37(b)(2)(C), SCRCP; see also In re Solomon, 307 \r\n  S.C. 1, 3, 413 S.E.2d 808, 809 (1992) (holding that â€œ[b]ecause [attorney] did \r\n  not respond [to the requests for admission], however, the allegations were deemed \r\n  admitted by the trial judge pursuant to Rule 37, SCRCP, and judgment was entered \r\n  against [client].â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s decision to allow GHA to withdraw the admissions was based \r\n  on the judgeâ€™s erroneous belief that requests for admissions could not displace \r\n  answers in pleadings.Â  The court failed to consider the prejudice that would \r\n  and did result to Scott due to the withdrawal of the admissions.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we REVERSE the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow withdrawal of the admissions, \r\n  REVERSE the juryâ€™s verdict in the trial, and REMAND the matter \r\n  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nCONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The second paragraph of Rule 36(a) was amended effective September 1, 2001, \r\n    to reflect the change in Rule 29 allowing parties, under certain circumstances, \r\n    to stipulate to extensions.Â  Because this amendment occurred after the underlying \r\n    events in the present case, it has no effect on our analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3617","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Jay E. Hodge, Jr., of Cheraw; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Bobby Watson appeals his convictions \r\n  for first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor and committing a \r\n  lewd act upon a child under the age of sixteen years, arguing the trial court \r\n  erred in not allowing him to present surrebuttal testimony in response to the \r\n  Stateâ€™s reply evidence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action arises out of allegations \r\n  that Watson abused his girlfriendâ€™s daughter (the victim). \r\n  [1] Â  In July 1999, the victim, then nine years old, told her grandmother \r\n  that Watson had sexually abused her for two years.Â  At trial, the victim testified \r\n  that Watson had made her â€œsuck his private partsâ€ and had â€œgrabbed [her] hand \r\n  and put it on his front private part and rubbed up and down.â€Â  The victim also \r\n  testified Watson made her sit on his penis and that he had touched her â€œinside.â€Â  \r\n  The victim stated the incidents occurred when she stayed with her mother, her \r\n  brother, and Watson in a two-bedroom trailer and also at her grandmotherâ€™s house.Â  \r\n\r\nWatson denied the allegations and maintained \r\n  they resulted from the fact that his girlfriend was mad at him for cheating \r\n  on her, as was her family; he contended the victim â€œvery seldom was in our house.â€Â  \r\n  Watson testified that he and his girlfriend lived in a trailer with their son, \r\n  and that the victim did not live with them during the time the acts allegedly \r\n  occurred, when the victim was seven to nine.Â  Rather, the victim stayed with \r\n  her grandmother â€œpractically all the timeâ€ and â€œwas a visitor in [his] home \r\n  [the trailer].â€Â  Watson asserted that he was never left alone with the victim.Â  \r\n  He also presented a defense theory that the allegations could have been the \r\n  product of suggested memories based on the victim having seen pornographic movies \r\n  and a sex channel on television that the victimâ€™s grandmother allegedly subscribed \r\n  to. [2] Â  He alternatively asserted that \r\n  if there was any sexual abuse, it was committed by someone else.Â  \r\nIn reply, the State presented the testimony of \r\n  a neighbor, who stated that she often saw Watson, his girlfriend, their son, \r\n  and the victim at the trailer from 1997 to 1999, although the victim would sometimes \r\n  stay at her grandparentsâ€™ house.Â  The neighbor also testified that she went \r\n  to the trailer to borrow something one day and Watson was home with just his \r\n  son and the victim.Â  During cross-examination, the witness admitted having a \r\n  criminal record involving fraudulent checks and shoplifting.Â  \r\nA jury convicted Watson of first-degree CSC with \r\n  a minor and committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of sixteen years.Â  \r\n  The trial court sentenced him to thirty years in prison for the CSC charge and \r\n  a concurrent fifteen years for the charge of committing a lewd act.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWatson contends he is entitled to a new trial based \r\n  on the trial courtâ€™s failure to allow him to present surrebuttal testimony. \r\n\r\nAfter the State presented reply testimony from \r\n  Watsonâ€™s neighbor, the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\nMRS. RIVERS [Defense counsel]:Â  Your Honor, I would ask to \r\n  put the defendant on the stand for rebuttal.\r\nMS. MAYES [State]:Â  I know of absolutely no provision under \r\n  the law of the Rules of Evidence that allows that, Your Honor.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  I donâ€™t either.\r\nAny matters of law at this time?Â \r\n\r\nThe parties then proceeded to discuss jury charges.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, Watson himself addressed the court and stated, â€œYour Honor, I want \r\n  to ask you can I comment on what this testimony was because this lady right \r\n  here that just stated this testimony was evicted.Â  Katrina, the mother of the \r\n  victim, lived with this woman.â€Â  Watson told the court that his father would \r\n  also be willing to testify.Â  The court stated:Â  â€œIâ€™m sorry.Â  I am not allowed \r\n  under procedure to let that happen.Â  That was reply from the State after you \r\n  put up your defense, Mr. Watson.â€Â  \r\nOn appeal, Watsonâ€™s appellate counsel argues the \r\n  trial court erred in failing to exercise its discretion or, alternatively, abused \r\n  its discretion, when it did not allow the defense to present surrebuttal testimony \r\n  to address allegedly new matter brought out in the Stateâ€™s reply evidence.Â  \r\n  Counsel contends that, contrary to the trial courtâ€™s ruling, surrebuttal testimony \r\n  is allowed under South Carolina law, citing Camlin v. Bi-Lo, Inc. [3]  and State v. Summer [4]  as supporting authority.\r\nInitially, we find it questionable whether this \r\n  issue was preserved for consideration on direct appeal as this argument appears \r\n  to be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  When the trial court denied the \r\n  request to present the additional testimony, it did so based on its apparent \r\n  belief that additional testimony was not allowed after the Stateâ€™s reply.Â  No \r\n  argument was raised by the defense that such surrebuttal testimony is, in fact, \r\n  allowed in the courtâ€™s discretion. [5] Â  \r\nOn the merits, contrary to the trial courtâ€™s statement \r\n  that it was â€œnot allowed under procedure to let that happen,â€ some authorities \r\n  note that there are occasions when the trial court may allow surrebuttal testimony \r\n  in its discretion:\r\n\r\nSurrebuttal is appropriate when, in the judgeâ€™s discretion, \r\n  new matter or new facts are injected for the first time in rebuttal[,] especially \r\n  where the evidence offered in surrebuttal is for the first time made competent \r\n  by the evidence introduced by plaintiff in rebuttal.\r\nOn the other hand, if the evidence sought to be introduced \r\n  in surrebuttal could or should have been introduced at an earlier stage, its \r\n  admission or rejection is a matter for the discretion of the trial court, as \r\n  where the evidence is cumulative, or where there is no sufficient excuse for \r\n  not introducing the evidence in chief at the proper time. \r\n  [6] \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina courts have approved the \r\n  use of surrebuttal testimony in the discretion of the trial court.Â  In Goethe \r\n  v. Browning, [7]  our supreme \r\n  court stated:Â  â€œAdmission of evidence in surrebuttal is very much in the discretion \r\n  of the trial judge.â€ [8] Â  In \r\n  State v. Summer, the court observed:Â  â€œ[I]f the plaintiff [or the prosecution \r\n  in a criminal case] in reply puts new matter in evidence, or makes a new case \r\n  different from that at first made out, it becomes the right of the defendant \r\n  to call witnesses in surrebuttal.â€ [9] Â  Further, in Camlin v. Bi-Lo, \r\n  Inc., we stated:Â  â€œA defendant has a right to respond to new evidence given \r\n  in reply.â€ [10] Â  \r\nThus, the trial court erred when it stated it was \r\n  not allowed to permit additional testimony; however, we conclude Watson has \r\n  suffered no prejudice warranting reversal, in any event, as the Stateâ€™s reply \r\n  witness did not raise any new evidence.Â  The reply witnessâ€™s testimony that \r\n  she saw the victim, her younger brother, her mother, and Watson living together \r\n  in the trailer and that she saw Watson home alone with the victim and her younger \r\n  brother was cumulative to the testimony of the victim and her grandmother, who \r\n  both testified during the Stateâ€™s case-in-chief that Watson had been alone with \r\n  the victim and her younger brother on nights when his girlfriend was working, \r\n  and that the victim stayed at the trailer with him.Â  Additionally, we note the \r\n  victim testified the abuse occurred not only when her mother was gone, but also \r\n  while her mother was home asleep.Â  Finally, the evidence Watson would have offered, \r\n  i.e., that the neighbor had been evicted and had lived with his ex-girlfriend, \r\n  were matters going to credibility that could have been brought out during cross-examination.Â  \r\n  Defense counsel did elicit on cross-examination the fact that the neighbor had \r\n  prior convictions so as to attack her credibility.Â  Accordingly, Watsonâ€™s conviction \r\n  and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and SHULER, J., concur. &nbsp; \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Although the victim was not his child, Watson and his girlfriend \r\n    did have one child together, a son.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  During an interview with a psychologist, the victim reported having \r\n    briefly seen, on two occasions, portions of sexually explicit videotapes that \r\n    were mistakenly put in the VCR.Â  Her grandmother (or another adult), however, \r\n    had realized the mistake and retrieved them.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  311 S.C. 197, 428 S.E.2d 6 (Ct.

Corley, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nCarlos W. Gibbons, Jr., of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this post-divorce \r\n  domestic action, George Shannon (Husband) appeals an order of the family court \r\n  holding him in contempt and denying his plea for termination or modification \r\n  of his alimony obligation to Diane Shannon (Wife).Â  We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThe parties were divorced by order of the family \r\n  court in 1997.Â  The divorce decree provides, inter alia, that Husband is to \r\n  pay Wife $400 per month in periodic alimony with all payments to be made through \r\n  the court.Â  \r\nOn February 16, 1999, Wife was reported as a missing \r\n  person.Â  Her whereabouts have not been known since that date.Â  After her disappearance, \r\n  a conservatorship was established on Wifeâ€™s behalf. \r\nHusband instituted this action in April of 2001 \r\n  seeking termination of his alimony obligation to Wife.Â  Alternatively, Husband \r\n  sought modification of his alimony obligation, retroactive to the date Wife \r\n  was reported missing.Â  First Union Bank, in its capacity as Wifeâ€™s court-appointed \r\n  conservator, arranged for Wife to have legal representation.Â  Wifeâ€™s answer \r\n  to the complaint denied Husbandâ€™s entitlement to the relief sought, and contained \r\n  a counterclaim seeking an award of attorney fees and costs. Â Additionally, \r\n  because Husband was in arrears on his alimony payments, the family court issued \r\n  a rule to show cause why Husband should not be held in contempt for failure \r\n  to pay alimony. [1]   \r\nAfter a hearing on both actions, the court denied \r\n  Husbandâ€™s plea for relief from his alimony support obligation and held him in \r\n  contempt for failure to pay alimony.Â  The court determined his arrearage was \r\n  $7,763 as of the date of the order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may \r\n  find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); \r\n  Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred \r\n  in failing to grant him relief from his alimony obligation in light of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  continued status as a missing person.Â  We agree.\r\nIn denying Husband any relief from his alimony \r\n  obligation, the family court reasoned that Wifeâ€™s status as a missing person \r\n  is not, standing alone, a sufficient basis to terminate or suspend Husbandâ€™s \r\n  support obligation.Â  The court further reasoned that in the event Wife reappears, \r\n  she would be left without a remedy to collect any support obligation owed.Â  \r\n  We agree with Husband that the family courtâ€™s reasoning as to this issue is \r\n  flawed.\r\nAn award of periodic alimony may be modified pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code Annotated section 20-3-170 (1985).Â  That statute provides:\r\n\r\nWhenever [a spouse] . . . has been required to make [to] \r\n  his or her spouse any periodic payments of alimony and the circumstances of \r\n  the parties or the financial ability of the spouse making the periodic payments \r\n  shall have changed since the rendition of such judgment, either party may apply \r\n  to the court which rendered the judgment for an order and judgment decreasing \r\n  or increasing the amount of such alimony payments or terminating such payments. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to justify modification or termination \r\n  of an alimony award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  \r\n  Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, 372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nAs alleged in the complaint and admitted in the \r\n  answer, Wifeâ€™s whereabouts have not been known since on or before February 16, \r\n  1999.Â  Additionally, the record contains no evidence Wife is actually receiving \r\n  or in any way personally benefiting from Husbandâ€™s alimony payments.Â  The basic \r\n  purpose of alimony is to substitute for the support which is â€œnormally incident \r\n  to the marital relationship.â€Â  McNaughton v. McNaughton, 258 S.C. 554, \r\n  558, 189 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1972).Â  If these parties were not divorced, Husband \r\n  would have no obligation to provide financial support for a wife who chose to \r\n  disappear.\r\nIn our view, Wifeâ€™s sustained disappearance constitutes a \r\n  substantial change in the partiesâ€™ circumstances warranting a modification of \r\n  Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  Under the extraordinary circumstances of this \r\n  case, we are simply unable to conclude that the ends of justice and equity will \r\n  be served by requiring Husband to continue making alimony payments until such \r\n  time as Wife either reappears or is declared dead.Â  \r\nWe hold the peculiar circumstances of this case \r\n  warrant a modification amounting to suspension of Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation \r\n  retroactive to the date this litigation was commenced.Â  We therefore reverse \r\n  the family courtâ€™s order and remand the case for recalculation of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  arrearage consistent with this holding.\r\nAdditional considerations convince us this result \r\n  is equitable.Â  Although Husband did not seek modification, termination, or suspension \r\n  of his alimony obligation on any ground other than Wifeâ€™s continued status as \r\n  a missing person, his financial circumstances have changed since the court originally \r\n  ordered alimony.Â  He lost his job and now earns significantly less than at the \r\n  time of the divorce.Â  Additionally, although the court awarded custody of the \r\n  coupleâ€™s children to Wife, they were placed in Husbandâ€™s care before Wifeâ€™s \r\n  disappearance, and he has received no child support from Wife or her conservator.Â  \r\n\r\nRegarding the family courtâ€™s concern that Wife, \r\n  should she reappear, will be without legal means to recover the amount of support \r\n  that would have been due her if Husbandâ€™s obligation had not been suspended, \r\n  we note nothing prevents Wife from petitioning the family court to lift the \r\n  suspension ordered herein and to revisit the issue of alimony pursuant to the \r\n  provisions of section 20-3-170.Â  Our holding is not intended to prevent Wife \r\n  from pursuing such legal recourse should she reappear.Â  \r\nFurther, our decision is not intended to disturb the family \r\n  courtâ€™s findings as to contempt or any arrearage Husband accumulated prior to \r\n  the commencement of this action.Â  We are aware of no authority, and Husband \r\n  cites none, entitling a spouse to cease making court-ordered alimony payments \r\n  in the absence of a judicial order authorizing such relief.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  \r\n\r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Rule to Show Cause refers to Husbandâ€™s failure \r\n    to pay child support rather than alimony.Â  We determine that to be merely \r\n    a clerical oversight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3619","title":"Ex Parte: Polk v.

Boyd, of Rock Hill, for Appellants.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, Assistant \r\n  Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, of Columbia;Â  Daniel Dewitt Hall, of York; \r\n  and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a bond estreatment \r\n  case.Â  The sole issue on appeal concerns whether the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to consider the cost to the State of Henry Zbigniew Bartinickiâ€™s failure to \r\n  appear in court in ordering the estreatment of his bond.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBartinicki was arrested and charged \r\n  with trafficking in cocaine, distribution of marijuana, distribution of cocaine \r\n  within the proximity of a school, and distribution of marijuana within the proximity \r\n  of a school.Â  He was released on an appearance bond in the amount $37,000, with \r\n  Ned Polk, Jr., of York County Bail Agent, signing as surety.Â  Bartinicki failed \r\n  to appear in court when called on April 23, 2001, September 4, 2001, and September \r\n  10, 2001.Â  A bench warrant was issued for his arrest on September 12, 2001.Â  \r\n  He again failed to appear in court when his case was called onÂ  September 24, \r\n  October 8, and October 22, 2001.Â  On November 6, 2001, he was tried in his absence \r\n  and found guilty.\r\nThe circuit court held a bond estreatment \r\n  hearing on November 7, 2001.Â  Ned Polk, Sr. appeared on behalf of York County \r\n  Bail Agent in the place of his son, Ned Polk, Jr.Â  Polk requested additional \r\n  time to find Bartinicki, and requested that the bond be estreated in installments \r\n  over a six month period rather than in a lump sum.Â  In conjunction with this \r\n  request, the attorney for the surety asked the court to consider the cost to \r\n  the State for Bartinickiâ€™s trial, asserting the cost was less than the total \r\n  amount of the bond.Â  The trial court declined to take the cost of the trial \r\n  into account, reasoning only that Bartinicki was not yet in custody.\r\nIn a ruling from the bench and by amended order \r\n  dated November 22, 2001, the court directed that if Bartinicki was produced \r\n  within seven days of the hearing, the bond would not be estreated.Â  The order \r\n  further provided that, in the event Bartinicki was not produced within seven \r\n  days, one-fourth of the bond would be estreated and, thereafter, one-fourth \r\n  of the original amount of the bond would be estreated every month until Bartinicki \r\n  was produced or the bond was exhausted.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Polk asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to consider the cost to the State in reaching its decision \r\n  as to estreatment.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially, we disagree with the Stateâ€™s assertion that \r\n  Polk failed to raise the issue of remission to the trial court.Â  Our reading \r\n  of the record convinces us the trial judge understood the issue of remission \r\n  to have been before him for consideration inasmuch as the court ruled on the \r\n  issue of considering the cost to the State resulting from Bartinickiâ€™s failure \r\n  to appear.\r\nFurther, we hold the court erred in refusing to consider \r\n  the Stateâ€™s costs.Â  The overriding purpose of requiring a criminal defendant \r\n  to post bond before his release from custody is to insure his appearance at \r\n  trial.Â  State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 285, 423 S.E.2d 139, 141 (1992) \r\n  (Toal, J., dissenting).Â  As guarantor, the surety on an appearance bond undertakes \r\n  the risk of forfeiture in the event the defendant does not appear for trial.Â  \r\n  Pride v. Anders, 266 S.C. 338, 341, 223 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1976).Â  Thus, \r\n  the possible forfeiture of bond is incentive for sureties to ensure the appearance \r\n  of the defendant. Â The issue of whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted, \r\n  and if so, to what extent, is vested in the discretion of the trial judge.Â  \r\n  State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980);Â  State \r\n  v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 557, 206 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1974).\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-70 (2002) provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nIf a defendant fails to appear \r\n  at a court proceeding to which he has been summoned, the court must issue a \r\n  bench warrant for the defendant.Â  If the surety fails to surrender the defendant \r\n  or place a hold on the defendant's release from incarceration, commitment, or \r\n  institutionalization within thirty days of the issuance of the bench warrant, \r\n  the bond shall be forfeited.Â  At any time before execution is issued on a judgment \r\n  of forfeiture against a defendant or his surety, the court may direct that the \r\n  judgment be remitted in whole or in part, upon conditions as the court may impose, \r\n  if it appears that justice requires the remission of part or all of the judgment.Â  \r\n  In making a determination as to remission of the judgment, the court shall \r\n  consider the costs to the State or any county or municipality resulting \r\n  from the necessity to continue or terminate the defendant's trial and the efforts \r\n  of law enforcement officers or agencies to locate the defendant.Â  The court \r\n  in its discretion may permit the surety to pay the estreatment in installments \r\n  for a period of up to six months.Â  If at any time during the period in which \r\n  installments are to be paid the defendant is surrendered to the appropriate \r\n  detention facility and the surety complies with the re-commitment procedures, \r\n  the surety shall be relieved of any further liability.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nWhere the terms of a statute are clear and unambiguous, \r\n  there is no room for construction and the court must apply such terms according \r\n  to their literal meaning.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 13, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  137, 143 (1999).Â  An appellate court cannot construe a statute without regard \r\n  to its plain meaning.Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. \r\n  Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002).Â  Neither may it \r\n  resort to a forced interpretation in an attempt to expand or limit the scope \r\n  of a statute.Â  Id.\r\nUnquestionably, Bartinickiâ€™s bond was forfeited and \r\n  the trial court properly entered judgment on the bond.Â  However, Â§ 38-53-70 \r\n  unambiguously provides that the trial court must consider the costs to the State \r\n  in determining remission of the judgment on a forfeited bond.Â  Therefore, the \r\n  trial judge abused his discretion in failing to consider the costs to the State.Â  \r\n  We note, however, that in determining whether any remission of the judgment \r\n  is warranted, the trial court is not limited to considering only the actual \r\n  cost to the State.Â  Our courts have held the following factors, at the least, \r\n  should be considered in determining whether, and to what extent, the bond should \r\n  be remitted:Â  (1) the purpose of the bond;Â  (2) the nature and wilfulness of \r\n  the default;Â  (3) any prejudice or additional expense resulting to the State.Â  \r\n  Boatwright, 310 S.C. at 287, 423 S.E.2d at 142-43;Â  Workman, 274 \r\n  S.C. at 343, 263 S.E.2d at 866.\r\nIn conclusion, we hold, while the decision regarding \r\n  remission is within the discretion of the trial court, the court should consider, \r\n  at a minimum, the costs to the State as well as the purpose of the bond and \r\n  the nature and willfulness of the default in determining whether, and to what \r\n  extent, a bond forfeiture should be remitted. \r\n  [1] Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings \r\n  consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] In Boatwright, the dissent, citing Workman, indicated \r\n    the court should â€œat least considerâ€ the above three factors, suggesting that \r\n    other factors may be considered as well.Â  Boatwright, 310 S.C. at 287, \r\n    423 S.E.2d at 142-43.Â  Thus, it appears the trial court may consider the fact \r\n    that the defendant, Bartinicki, was not in custody at the time of the bond \r\n    estreatment hearing in determining whether, and if so to what extent, the \r\n    bond should be remitted.Â  At any rate, this fact would clearly be appropriate \r\n    for consideration in conjunction with the courtâ€™s deliberation of the costs \r\n    to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3620","title":"Campbell v.

Barbier and Joseph M. Kahn, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.:Â  Dr. Treadwell Campbell (Dr. Campbell) sued \r\n  Marion County Hospital District, d/b/a The Mullins Hospital (the Hospital), \r\n  under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for information including, \r\n  among other things, salaries, compensation, benefits, and bonuses offered to \r\n  all physicians recruited by the Hospital, as well as the prices paid for physician \r\n  practices purchased by the Hospital.Â  The Circuit Court ordered the Hospital \r\n  to disclose a portion of the requested information, but it further held that \r\n  information regarding physiciansâ€™ salaries, compensation, and purchase prices \r\n  of practices were â€œtrade secrets.â€Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and \r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn relation to a pending lawsuit, Dr. Campbell \r\n  requested that the Hospital produce certain information pursuant to the FOIA.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Dr. Campbell requested the Hospital provide information regarding: \r\n  (1) the compensation, benefits, and bonuses offered to physicians recruited \r\n  by the Hospital from 1988 to 1999; (2) the prices paid for the purchase of physician \r\n  practices; (3) the salaries of physicians whose practices were purchased by \r\n  the Hospital; (4) the salaries of specific physicians; (5) the amount of rent \r\n  paid to physician practices since 1988; and (6) the purchase price and a copy \r\n  of the invoice of purchase if the Hospital purchased the Marion Medical Group.Â  \r\n  The Hospital indicated it would provide the information regarding the amount \r\n  of rent paid to any physician or physician practice since 1988, but Dr. Campbell \r\n  would have to post a deposit of $1,500 to cover the expenses of researching \r\n  and copying the information.Â  The Hospital refused to provide any of the other \r\n  information stating information regarding physicians recruited, but not employed, \r\n  by the Hospital was incidental to proposed contractual arrangements and thus \r\n  exempt from disclosure.Â  The Hospital asserted the requested information regarding \r\n  physiciansâ€™ salaries and the purchase prices of physician practices constituted \r\n  â€œtrade secretsâ€ which were exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\r\nDr. Campbell sued the Hospital under the FOIA, requesting that the \r\n  Circuit Court (1) deem the withheld information to be public information within \r\n  the meaning of the FOIA; (2) enjoin the Hospital from withholding the information; \r\n  and (3) award Dr. Campbell costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The Hospital denied the \r\n  allegations of the complaint and maintained the allegations failed to state \r\n  a claim upon which relief could be granted.Â  With the exception of the amounts \r\n  of physician lease fees, the Hospital averred the requested information was \r\n  exempt from disclosure as â€œtrade secrets.â€Â  Both parties moved for summary judgment.\r\nAfter hearing arguments from both parties, the Circuit Court judge \r\n  issued an order: (1) finding the information regarding physicians recruited, \r\n  but not actually hired, by the Hospital was exempt from disclosure; (2) requiring \r\n  the Hospital to produce the information relating to physiciansâ€™ salaries and \r\n  the purchase price of practices, but barring Dr. Campbell from disclosing the \r\n  information to third parties; (3) directing the Hospital to disclose information \r\n  relating to the rents paid to physician practices; (4) compelling Dr. Campbell \r\n  to pay a $500 deposit to cover the costs of providing the information; and (5) \r\n  concluding Dr. Campbell was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Dr. Campbell filed \r\n  a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the Circuit \r\n  Court.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Circuit Court err in holding that Dr. Campbellâ€™s request for disclosure \r\n  of physiciansâ€™ salaries, bonuses, compensation, and purchase prices of physician \r\n  practices constituted â€œtrade secretsâ€ requiring a protective order?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Circuit Court err in refusing to award attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to \r\n  Dr. Campbell where he prevailed and the court ordered the production of all \r\n  the information requested from the Hospital?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough Dr. Campbell filed a motion for summary judgment, he actually \r\n  requested the Circuit Court to declare whether the withheld information was \r\n  exempt under the FOIA.\r\nDeclaratory judgments in and of themselves are neither legal nor equitable.Â  \r\n  See Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991); \r\n  Wiedemann v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 344 S.C. 233, 542 S.E.2d 752 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The standard of review for a declaratory judgment action is \r\n  therefore determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Doe v. South \r\n  Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 347 S.C. 642, \r\n  557 S.E.2d 670 (2001); Wiedemann, 344 S.C. at 236, 542 S.E.2d at 753; \r\n  see also Travelers Indem. Co. v. Auto World, 334 S.C. 137, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d 692 (Ct. App. 1999) (suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor \r\n  equitable, but is determined by nature of underlying issue).\r\nA declaratory judgment action under the FOIA to determine whether certain information \r\n  should be disclosed is an action at law.Â  See South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n \r\n  v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994).Â  \r\n  In an action at law tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of review \r\n  extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, \r\n  329 S.C. 385, 496 S.E.2d 21 (1998); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976); Okatie River v. Southeastern Site Prep, \r\n  Op. No. 3582 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 6, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at \r\n  32).Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably \r\n  supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. \r\n  606, 533 S.E.2d 886 (2000); Townes, 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775; \r\n  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  672 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\r\nThe South Carolina Freedom of Information Act is \r\n  codified as sections 30-4-10 to â€“165 in the South Carolina Code.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-10 to â€“165 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002).Â  The FOIA provides:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly finds that it is vital in a democratic \r\n  society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that \r\n  citizens shall be advised of the performance of public officials and of the \r\n  decisions that are reached in public activity and in the formulation of public \r\n  policy.Â  Toward this end, provisions of this chapter must be construed so as \r\n  to make it possible for citizens, or their representatives, to learn and report \r\n  fully the activities of their public officials at a minimum cost or delay to \r\n  the persons seeking access to public documents or meetings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (1991).\r\nThe essential purpose of the FOIA is to protect \r\n  the public from secret government activity.Â  Wiedemann v. Town of Hilton \r\n  Head Island, 330 S.C. 532, 500 S.E.2d 783 (1998); South Carolina Tax \r\n  Commâ€™n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994); \r\n  Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991); see \r\n  also Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 156, \r\n  547 S.E.2d 862 (2001) (the FOIA was enacted to prevent the government from acting \r\n  in secret).Â  â€œSouth Carolinaâ€™s FOIA was designed to guarantee the public reasonable \r\n  access to certain activities of the government.â€Â  Fowler v. Beasley, \r\n  322 S.C. 463, 468, 472 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1996).Â  The FOIA is remedial in nature \r\n  and should be liberally construed to carry out the purpose mandated by the legislature.Â  \r\n  Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 156, 547 S.E.2d \r\n  862 (2001); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health v. Hanna, 270 S.C. \r\n  210, 241 S.E.2d 563 (1978).\r\nSection 30-4-30(a) of the South Carolina Code provides: \r\n  â€œAny person has a right to inspect or copy any public record of a public body, \r\n  except as otherwise provided by Â§ 30-4-40, in accordance with reasonable rules \r\n  concerning time and place of access.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(a) (1991).Â Â  \r\n  The Hospital falls within the definition of â€œpublic bodyâ€ as set forth in Â§ \r\n  30-4-20(a), so as to render the FOIA applicable.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 30-4-20(a) (1991) (defining â€œpublic bodyâ€).\r\nThe FOIA meets â€œâ€˜the demand for open government \r\n  while preserving workable confidentiality in governmental decisionmaking.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991) (quoting \r\n  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 292 (1979)).Â  The FOIA creates \r\n  an affirmative duty on the part of public bodies to disclose information.Â  Bellamy, \r\n  305 S.C. at 295, 408 S.E.2d at 221.Â  The purpose of the Act is to protect the \r\n  public by providing for the disclosure of information.Â  Id.Â  However, \r\n  the exemptions from disclosure contained in Â§Â§ 30-4-40 and 30-4-70 do not create \r\n  a duty of nondisclosure.Â  Id.Â  These exemptions, at most, simply allow \r\n  the public agency the discretion to withhold exempted materials from public \r\n  disclosure.Â  Id.  \r\nII.Â  Trade Secrets\r\nDr. Campbell contends the Circuit Court erred in \r\n  finding information relating to physiciansâ€™ salaries, compensation, and the \r\n  purchase price of physician practices amounted to â€œtrade secretsâ€ necessitating \r\n  protection from disclosure. [1] Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nAt trial, the Hospital argued that physiciansâ€™ salaries and prices \r\n  paid for practices constituted â€œtrade secretsâ€ because, as a rural county hospital, \r\n  it needed to keep the information private in order to attract qualified physicians \r\n  and to compete with wealthier, urban areas.Â  At the summary judgment hearing, \r\n  Dr. Campbell submitted affidavits from Irance Collins, M.D., and Lewis W. Mustard, \r\n  Ph.D., regarding the different factors physicians consider in deciding where \r\n  to practice.Â  Collins, a physician in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, declared \r\n  that his primary considerations in selecting a hospital for â€œaffiliation and \r\n  contractual engagement in a rural areaâ€ included: â€œ1. Environment; 2. Schools; \r\n  3. Support from the hospital staff; 4. Opportunity for expansion; 5. Compensation \r\n  and benefits; 6. Diversity of the community practice; [and] 7. Patient and proximity \r\n  to healthcare teaching facilities.â€Â \r\nIn his affidavit, Mustard, the Chief Executive Officer and President \r\n  of Healthcare Negligence Control, Inc., in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, stated:\r\n\r\nBased upon my experience in the medical field, when physicians \r\n  are deciding on where to establish their practices, or what hospitals they will \r\n  work for, they consider a variety of enticements.Â  These factors include whether \r\n  the area is rural or urban, other healthcare facilities in the area, the quality \r\n  of the schools in the area, the quality of emergency service, and the hospital \r\n  resolutions.Â  Compensation, bonuses, and benefits are three of several other \r\n  requisite factors that physicians consider.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mustard, because physicians consider so many factors, the release \r\n  of information regarding compensation, bonuses, and benefits paid to physicians \r\n  as well as purchase prices of physician practices would not impede a hospitalâ€™s \r\n  ability to recruit and retain physicians or to compete with other area hospitals.Â  \r\n  Mustard professed that public policy is furthered by disclosing information \r\n  regarding compensation, bonuses, benefits, and purchase prices of physician \r\n  practices paid by public hospitals.Â  He declared that public policy favors disclosing \r\n  information as to how the taxpayersâ€™ money is spent, as the public has the right \r\n  to be informed and governmental agencies must be held to some level of accountability.Â  \r\n  Mustard explained that information as to the compensation, bonuses, and benefits, \r\n  as well as purchase prices of physician practices paid by public hospitals is \r\n  generally disclosed under the FOIA.Â  He said that such information does not \r\n  constitute commercially valuable plans or processes; work products, in whole \r\n  or in part collected or produced for sale or resale; competitive information; \r\n  formula, pattern compilation, program, method or process that derives independent \r\n  economic value to the hospital; or valuable information to a hospital, giving \r\n  it the opportunity to obtain a significant advantage over its competition.\r\nAfter considering the partiesâ€™ arguments, the Circuit \r\n  Court ordered the disclosure of the information relating to physician salaries \r\n  and purchase prices of practices.Â  However, the court noted the requirements \r\n  of the â€œtrade secretâ€ exemption to the FOIA in prohibiting Dr. Campbell from \r\n  further disclosing the information:\r\n\r\n[Dr. Campbellâ€™s] request for information relating to salaries paid to physicians \r\n  employed by the [Hospital] and the purchase price paid by the [Hospital] for \r\n  physician practices raises a novel issue in South Carolina as to whether such \r\n  information falls within the trade secrets exemption as defined under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(1). . . .\r\nThis Court finds that the [Hospital] is a public body that markets services \r\n  in competition with others.Â  This Court further recognizes that the healthcare \r\n  industry is a very competitive industry and that a public hospital such as the \r\n  [Hospital] could be at a disadvantage in the recruitment and retention of physicians \r\n  if information relating to physician salaries and purchase prices paid for physician \r\n  practices is made public.Â  However, this Court notes that there is no South \r\n  Carolina precedent in which physician salaries and prices paid for physician \r\n  practices have been found to be â€œcompetitive information.â€Â  Therefore, this \r\n  Court orders that the [Hospital] produce the information requested by [Dr. Campbell] \r\n  relating to physician salaries and the prices paid by the [Hospital] for physician \r\n  practices with the following limitations:\r\n  \r\n[Dr. Campbell] shall not disclose to anyone not [a] party or legal counsel to \r\n  the parties in the case pending between [Dr. Campbell] and the [Hospital] in \r\n  the Circuit Court for Marion County, Case No. 99-CP-33-394, any information \r\n  produced by the [Hospital] relating to physician salaries and prices paid for \r\n  physician practices.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn its order denying Dr. Campbellâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the \r\n  Circuit Court further clarified its findings:\r\n\r\nThis Court finds that the [Hospital] is a public body that markets services \r\n  in competition with others.Â  This Court further recognizes that the healthcare \r\n  industry is a very competitive industry and that a public hospital such as the \r\n  [Hospital] could be at a disadvantage in the recruitment and retention of physicians \r\n  if information relating to physician salaries and purchase prices paid for physician \r\n  practices is made public.Â  Although this Court notes that there is no South \r\n  Carolina precedent in which physician salaries and prices paid for physician \r\n  practices have been found to be â€œcompetitive information,â€ I am persuaded \r\n  by the [Hospitalâ€™s] argument that such information may constitute â€œtrade secretsâ€ \r\n  as defined under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(1).Â  Therefore, this Court \r\n  rejects [Dr. Campbellâ€™s] contention that it was improper for this Court to order \r\n  the [Hospital] to produce this information under a protective order.Â  (Emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides that any person has a right to inspect or copy \r\n  â€œany public record of a public bodyâ€ unless an exemption listed in Â§ 30-4-40 \r\n  applies.Â  South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., \r\n  316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(a) (1991); see \r\n  also Beattie v. Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 319 S.C. 449, \r\n  462 S.E.2d 276 (1995) (observing the FOIA provides the right to inspect or copy \r\n  any public record of a public body; however, the FOIA enumerates certain exemptions). \r\n  Â Matters which public bodies may, but are not required to, exempt from disclosure \r\n  under the FOIA include â€œtrade secretsâ€:\r\n\r\nTrade secrets, which are defined as unpatented, secret, commercially valuable \r\n  plans, appliances, formulas, or processes, which are used for the making, preparing, \r\n  compounding, treating, or processing of articles or materials which are trade \r\n  commodities obtained from a person and which are generally recognized as confidential; \r\n  and work products, in whole or in part collected or produced for sale or resale, \r\n  and paid subscriber information.Â  Trade secrets also include, for those public \r\n  bodies who market services or products in competition with others, feasibility, \r\n  planning, and marketing studies, and evaluations and other materials which contain \r\n  references to potential customers, competitive information, or evaluation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(1) (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  Additionally, the FOIA allows a public body to exempt from disclosure \r\n  all compensation paid to employees unless the employee receives â€œcompensation \r\n  of fifty thousand dollars or more annually.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(6)(A) \r\n  (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002).\r\nThe Federal FOIA exempts â€œtrade secretsâ€ from disclosure.Â  It states \r\n  that the disclosure requirements of the FOIA do not apply to matters that are \r\n  â€œtrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person \r\n  and privileged or confidential.â€Â  5 U.S.C. Â§ 552(b)(4) (1996).Â  The phrase â€œtrade \r\n  secretsâ€ is not defined in the Federal FOIA.Â  However, cases interpreting the \r\n  section have defined a â€œtrade secretâ€ for the purposes of the FOIA as a â€œâ€˜secret, \r\n  commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the \r\n  making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that \r\n  can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Center for Auto Safety v. National Hwy. Traffic Safety Admin., 244 F.3d \r\n  144, 150-51 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Herrick v. Garvey, 298 F.3d 1184, 1190 \r\n  (10th Cir. 2002).\r\nAlthough the Federal courts have interpreted â€œtrade secretsâ€ to mean \r\n  something of commercial benefit in preparing commodities for the market, South \r\n  Carolina courts have never directly addressed the â€œtrade secretâ€ exemption to \r\n  the FOIA.Â  We must first look at the plain meaning of â€œtrade secretsâ€ in the \r\n  statute in order to determine whether salaries, compensation and purchase prices \r\n  of physician practices constitute â€œtrade secrets.â€Â  Salaries, compensation, \r\n  and purchase prices of practices do not constitute unpatented, secret, commercially \r\n  valuable plans or processes used for making, preparing, or processing trade \r\n  commodities obtained from a third party.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(1) \r\n  (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002).Â  This information does not qualify as work product \r\n  collected for sale or resale or paid subscriber information.Â  See Â§ 30-4-40(a)(1).\r\nThe statute specifically defines â€œtrade secretsâ€ \r\n  for public bodies, such as the Hospital, that market services.Â  â€œTrade secretsâ€ \r\n  include â€œfeasibility, planning, and marketing studies, and evaluations and other \r\n  materials which contain references to potential customers, competitive information, \r\n  or evaluation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(1) (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002).Â  It \r\n  is evident from reading the entire â€œtrade secretâ€ section that the legislature \r\n  intended the â€œtrade secretâ€ exemption to protect an organizationâ€™s studies or \r\n  preparations in its quest to produce or sell its product or service to â€œpotential \r\n  customers,â€ not in its internal quest to obtain employees.Â  Compensation and \r\n  salary information regarding physicians and the purchase price of physician \r\n  practices indubitably do not meet this unambiguous definition.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  the Circuit Court erred in finding the information constituted â€œtrade secretsâ€ \r\n  that mandated protection.\r\nFurthermore, the information Dr. Campbell sought regarding physiciansâ€™ \r\n  salaries, compensation, and the purchase price of physician practices was not \r\n  exempt under other subsections.Â  The legislature specifically noted that FOIA \r\n  requests for salaries â€œof fifty thousand dollars or more annuallyâ€ were not \r\n  exempt.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(6)(A) (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002).Â  The Hospital \r\n  admitted that most of its physicians made more than $50,000 in compensation.Â  \r\n  A clear application of the entire exemption statute, as a whole, demonstrates \r\n  that the information sought by Dr. Campbell was not exempt.\r\nWe next turn to whether the Circuit Court erred \r\n  in prohibiting Dr. Campbell from further disclosing the information regarding \r\n  salaries, compensation and purchase prices of physician practices.Â  The purpose \r\n  of the FOIA is to keep the public informed and to protect the public from secret \r\n  government activity.Â  Section 30-4-15 indicates the FOIA should be construed \r\n  in favor of allowing citizen access to the public bodyâ€™s information.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (1991).\r\nInformation obtained pursuant to the FOIA from \r\n  a public body is not protected by a restraining order.Â  In fact, the South Carolina \r\n  Attorney Generalâ€™s 1998 â€œPublic Officialâ€™s Guide to Compliance with South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  Freedom of Information Act,â€ states the FOIA must be construed â€œliberally to \r\n  carry out its intent that citizens obtain public information at the least cost, \r\n  inconvenience, or delay.Â  Consistent with this mandate, my Office has adopted \r\n  the following guiding principles in opinions construing the FOIA:Â  When in doubt, \r\n  disclose. . . .â€Â  Liberally construing the statute, it is luculent that information \r\n  obtained pursuant to the FOIA is for the protection of the public in general, \r\n  not just the individual seeking the information.Â  There is no provision in the \r\n  FOIA allowing the disclosure to be subject to a protective order.\r\nMoreover, an evidentiary review reveals that a protective order was \r\n  not necessary.Â  Evidence in the record shows that physiciansâ€™ salaries, compensation, \r\n  and the potential purchase price for practices are only three of many considerations \r\n  a potential employee looks to in deciding where to practice.Â  Therefore, disclosure \r\n  of that information would not impede a hospitalâ€™s efforts to hire.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the Circuit Court erred in prohibiting Dr. Campbell from further disclosing \r\n  information regarding physiciansâ€™ salaries, compensation, and purchase prices \r\n  of physician practices obtained pursuant to the FOIA.\r\nIn summary, the Circuit Court correctly granted Dr. Campbell access \r\n  to the information regarding physician compensation and prices for physician \r\n  practices.Â  The Circuit Court erred in finding this information constituted \r\n  â€œtrade secretsâ€ and in granting a protective order of the disclosure of the \r\n  information.\r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nDr. Campbell claims the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying \r\n  his request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs when he was the prevailing party.\r\nIn denying Dr. Campbellâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, \r\n  the Circuit Court held:\r\n\r\nIt is within this Courtâ€™s discretion to award attorneyâ€™s fees in an action brought \r\n  under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act.Â  This Court finds that \r\n  the [Hospital] made a good-faith argument under the law to support its objection \r\n  relating to [Dr. Campbellâ€™s] request for information.Â  The [Hospital] raised \r\n  legitimate concerns about the disclosure of sensitive information and the effect \r\n  such disclosure could have on its ability to compete in a competitive marketplace.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the Court denies Dr. Campbellâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n\r\nIn its order denying Dr. Campbellâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the Circuit \r\n  Court reiterated its reasoning that the Hospital made a good-faith argument \r\n  against disclosure of the information.Â  The court stated that only a part of \r\n  the information originally sought by Dr. Campbell was actually ordered to beÂ  \r\n  disclosed.\r\nInferentially, the order of the Circuit Court indicates Dr. Campbell sought \r\n  information regarding proposed compensation of physicians recruited, but not \r\n  hired, by the Hospital.Â  The court found this information exempt from the FOIA \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(5) regarding documents incidental to proposed \r\n  contractual arrangements.Â  Although Dr. Campbellâ€™s complaint requests the information \r\n  on physicians recruited by the Hospital, it does not specify whether he sought \r\n  information on physicians recruited but not hired.Â  At the summary judgment \r\n  hearing, Dr. Campbell sought information regarding physicians recruited and \r\n  actually hired.Â  â€œDocuments of and documents incidental to proposed contractual \r\n  arrangements . . . are not exempt from disclosure once a contract is entered \r\n  into.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(5) (Supp. 2002).\r\nThe FOIA provides for attorneyâ€™s fees to a prevailing party seeking \r\n  relief under the act.Â  Pursuant to Â§ 30-4-100(b), â€œ[i]f a person or entity seeking \r\n  such relief prevails, he or it may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and other \r\n  costs of litigation.Â  If such person or entity prevails in part, the court may \r\n  in its discretion award him or it reasonable attorney fees or an appropriate \r\n  portion thereof.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-100(b) (1991); see also Society \r\n  of Profâ€™l Journalists v. Sexton, 283 S.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d 313 (1984) (recognizing \r\n  that section 30-4-100 allows award of attorneyâ€™s fees to prevailing plaintiff \r\n  in FOIA case).Â  Under this section, the only prerequisite to an award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs is that the party seeking relief must prevail, in whole or in \r\n  part.Â  Where a plaintiff prevails on his request for declaratory relief, it \r\n  is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion to award attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to \r\n  the plaintiff.Â  See Cockrell by Cockrell v. Trustees of Dist. 20 Constituent \r\n  Sch. Dist., 299 S.C. 155, 382 S.E.2d 923 (1989); see also Litchfield \r\n  Plantation Co. v. Georgetown County Water &amp; Sewer Dist., 314 S.C. 30, \r\n  443 S.E.2d 574 (1994) (as Â§ 30-4-100(b) provides attorneyâ€™s fees may \r\n  be awarded, judge has discretion to award fees).\r\nThe decision on whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is discretionary \r\n  in nature.Â  The Circuit Court abused its discretion in this instance.Â  The FOIA \r\n  creates a mechanism for members of the public to obtain information from an \r\n  obstinate or otherwise uncooperative public body.Â  Where one party prevails \r\n  in his or her claim for information under the FOIA, the Circuit Court has the \r\n  discretion to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Here, the court based its decision to \r\n  deny attorneyâ€™s fees on the fact that the issue regarding â€œtrade secretsâ€ was \r\n  a novel, but legitimate, concern and the courtâ€™s belief that Dr. Campbell only \r\n  received a portion of the information he sought.Â  Dr. Campbell was actually \r\n  awarded all of the information he requested.Â  The Circuit Courtâ€™s finding regarding \r\n  â€œtrade secretsâ€ was erroneous.Â  The courtâ€™s decision denying Dr. Campbell attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees is in contrariety to the evidence.Â  We reverse the Circuit Court as to \r\n  this issue and remand the matter to the court for a new hearing to determine \r\n  if Dr. Campbell was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule that physician salaries, compensation and the prices paid \r\n  for physician practices are NOT â€œtrade secretsâ€ exempt \r\n  from the FOIA.Â  We hold that the information disclosed pursuant to the \r\n  FOIA action is not subject to a protective order.Â  Finally, the \r\n  court erred in basing its decision to deny attorneyâ€™s fees on its erroneous \r\n  belief that Dr. Campbell was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees where the issue \r\n  was novel.\r\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM the Circuit Courtâ€™s order to disclose the information \r\n  regarding physician salaries, compensation and prices paid for physician practices, \r\n  REVERSE the courtâ€™s finding that this information constituted a â€œtrade \r\n  secretâ€ exempt from the FOIA, REVERSE the protective order, REVERSE \r\n  the courtâ€™s denial of attorneyâ€™s fees, and REMAND the case for a hearing \r\n  to determine if Dr. Campbell was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\n AFFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., and MOREHEAD, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Dr. Campbell does not appeal the Circuit Courtâ€™s finding that information \r\n    relating to physicians recruited, but not actually hired, is exemptÂ  from \r\n    disclosure under the FOIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
