Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4081\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2006 â€“ Filed February 13, 2006Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James Wofford Bannister, of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\n        James Andrew Quinn, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Andy McDonald, Jason Martin, and Jonathan Corn (Defendants) were convicted in magistrateâ€™s court of hunting deer over bait in Abbeville County.Â  The circuit court affirmed the convictions, rejecting Defendantsâ€™ argument that the regulation they allegedly violated was ineffective on the date in question because the statute on which it was based had been repealed.Â  Defendants appeal to this court.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn May 26, 1995, Regulation 2.9 was published in Volume 19, Issue 5 of the South Carolina State Register.Â  The South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department (now the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources) enacted Regulation 2.9 as part of 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 123-40 (1982).Â  Specifically, Regulation 2.9 prohibits (1) â€œbaiting or hunting over a baited area or taking wildlife over a baited areaâ€ on all wildlife management area lands[2]; and (2) baiting, hunting over bait, or taking over bait â€œBig Gameâ€ on â€œother lands within the Central Piedmont, Western Piedmont and Mountain Hunt Units.â€[3]Â  \r\nWhen the Department promulgated Regulation 2.9, it incorrectly cited only South Carolina Code section 50-9-150 as the enabling statutory authority.Â  Section 50-9-150 granted the Department authority to prescribe methods for taking game; however, this authority was limited to activity on wildlife management areas.[4]Â  Although South Carolina Code section 50-11-310 authorized the Department to regulate deer hunting on land other than wildlife management areas,[5] the Department did not cite this section when it promulgated Regulation 2.9.Â  \r\nThe time limit to challenge the procedural validity of Regulation 2.9 expired without incident on May 26, 1996.[6]Â  On May 30, 1996, the South Carolina General Assembly passed Act 372, which amended Chapter 9 of Title 50 of the South Carolina Code.[7]Â  Although section 50-9-150 was not listed among the statutes expressly repealed by Act 372, the legislature significantly revised many of its provisions and incorporated them elsewhere within Title 50.[8]Â  Act 372 took effect July 1, 1996.[9]Â  \r\nOn November 10, 2001, Eddie Monts, an officer with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources observed Defendants hunting deer over bait in Abbeville County.Â  Monts arrested Defendants and charged them under South Carolina Code section 50-11-350 for violating Regulation 2.9.[10]Â  From the briefs and record on appeal, it appears Defendants were not hunting in a wildlife management area when Monts apprehended them.\r\nAfter denying a motion by Defendants to dismiss the charges for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the magistrate conducted a trial and convicted Defendants as charged.Â  Defendants appealed to the Court of Common Pleas for Abbeville County, which heard the matter on March 4, 2004.Â  On April 15, 2004, the circuit court issued an opinion affirming the convictions.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the repeal of a statute given as the authority for the promulgation of an administrative regulation bars a prosecution for a violation of that regulation.Â  We hold it does, notwithstanding the presence of other statutory authority that arguably could have supported the regulation but was not cited when the agency promulgated the regulation.\r\nâ€œAn administrative agency has only such powers as have been conferred by law and must act within the authority granted for that purpose.â€[11]Â  With regard to rulemaking, the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act requires an agency to give notice of the proposed action in the State Register[12] and to include in the notice â€œthe agencyâ€™s statutory authority for promulgating the regulation.â€[13]Â  \r\nâ€œThe general rule is that the repeal of a statute operates retrospectively, and has the effect of blotting it out as completely as if it had never existed and of putting an end to all proceedings under it.â€[14]Â  Although an administrative agency may have the power to enforce a repealed statute, this authority exists only if there is an applicable savings clause and the violation at issue precedes the expiration date of the statute.[15]\r\nThe circuit court characterized the Departmentâ€™s failure to list the correct statutory authority for Regulation 2.9 as â€œmerely a procedural errorâ€ and held that, under South Carolina Code section 1-23-110(D), a challenge had to have been made by May 26, 1996, one year after the effective date of the regulation.[16]Â  The court concluded that â€œthe statute of limitations has run on [Regulation 2.9]â€ and that â€œ[b]ecause statutory authority for the regulation continued to exist after the repeal of S.C. Code Â§ 50-9-150, the regulation remained in force.â€\r\nWe find the circuit courtâ€™s analysis troubling for a number of reasons.Â  \r\nInitially, we had some concern as to whether section 50-9-150 had in fact been repealed.Â  Although the 2005 supplement to Title 50 of the South Carolina Code indicates section 50-9-150 had been â€œRepealed by 1996 Act No. 372, Â§ 2, eff. July 1, 1996,â€ it was not among those statutes expressly repealed by this legislation, all of which were listed in section 5 of Act 372.Â  In addition, the general presumption against the legislative intention to repeal a statute when express terms of repeal are not used[17] and the fact that the General Assembly has not yet adopted the 2004 supplement[18] have prompted us to review the history of section 50-9-150 for the limited purpose of determining whether, in the present appeal, it can support Defendantsâ€™ convictions.\r\nNotwithstanding our initial concern, we hold that, for the purpose of deciding this appeal, it was correct to rely on the premise that section 50-9-150 had been repealed, at least to the extent that this statute cannot support the convictions at issue.Â  The preamble to section 2 of Act 372, entitled â€œHunting, fishing, and trapping licenses revised,â€ states that the purpose of the section is to â€œfurther amend[ ]â€ Chapter 9, Title 50 of the South Carolina Code to read in a particular way, rather than to simply add or delete certain provisions.[19]Â  Moreover, after examining the specific provisions of the version of section 50-9-150 in effect during the promulgation of Regulation 2.9,[20] we are of the opinion that the only one that has remained intact after the passage of Act 372 was the delegation of authority to the Department to â€œestablish open and closed seasons, bag limits, and methods for hunting and taking wildlife on all wildlife management areas.â€[21]Â  As the Department appears to have conceded, however, this provision cannot support Regulation 2.9 insofar as that regulation governs hunting on lands that are not within wildlife management areas.[22]\r\nTurning to the arguments Defendants have raised on appeal, we first question the significance the circuit court ascribed to the fact that Regulation 2.9 went unchallenged for one year after its publication in the State Register.Â  This controversy does not concern procedural noncompliance in promulgating a regulation; rather, the question is whether the repeal of section 50-9-150, the statute referenced during the promulgation of Regulation 2.9, operates as a repeal of the regulation itself.Â  We hold that it does.[23]Â  \r\nIn so holding, we cite with favor In re Terrence M.,[24] on which Defendants rely in their appeals to both the circuit court and to this court.Â  In that case, this court sua sponte vacated an adjudication of delinquency based on the repeal of the statute under which the juvenile was charged.[25]Â  \r\nThe circuit court attempted to distinguish Terrence M. from the present controversy, relying on the argument that â€œDefendants violated a regulation that was backed by several points of statutory authority,â€ reasoning that â€œ[i]f separate statutory authority had existed in [Terrence M.], it would have been affirmed.â€Â  \r\nIrrespective of whether the delinquency adjudication in Terrence M. would have remained valid had there been other statutory authority that could have supported it, we are of the opinion that no court in this State has the authority to uphold a regulation by gratuitously considering statutory authority that the enacting agency apparently failed to consider during the rulemaking process.Â  We base this holding on Global Van Lines, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission,[26] a case Defendants cited in their brief to this court.Â  \r\nIn Global Van Lines, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in construing a provision of the Federal Administrative Procedures Act analogous to section 1-23-110(A)(1)(c), noted that Congress, when enacting the Act, stated that â€œâ€˜[a]gency notice must be sufficient to fairly apprise interested parties of the issues involved, so that they may present responsive data or argument relating theretoâ€™â€[27] and that â€œâ€˜[t]he required specification of legal authority must be done with particularity.â€™â€[28]Â  The court refused to determine whether the regulation at issue in the case could be upheld on the basis of a statute that had not been mentioned in the notice of proposed rulemaking, explaining as follows:\r\n\r\n  [The Federal Administrative Procedures Act] . . . at the very least requires that the legal grounds upon which the agency thought it was proceeding appear somewhere in the administrative record.Â  A decision of that magnitude should not be left to the imagination of counsel on appeal, for â€œ[t]he purpose of requiring a statement of the basis and purpose is to enable courts, which have the duty to exercise review, to be aware of the legal and factual framework underlying the agencyâ€™s action.â€ . . . It has, moreover, been settled for at least forty years that â€œ[t]he grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.â€Â  Speculations about what might have been good reasons had the agency only thought of them do not suffice.[29]\r\n\r\nLikewise, we agree with Defendants that their convictions cannot be upheld on the basis of a statute that was never cited in the promulgation of the regulation that they were charged with violating.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe prohibition in Regulation 2.9 against hunting over bait on locations outside wildlife management areas is no longer enforceable.Â  The statute cited as the enabling legislation for the regulation is no longer in effect as enacted, and the only intact provision of the statute authorizes the Department of Natural Resources to regulate hunting only on wildlife management area lands.Â  Because the violations at issue here concerned a defunct prohibition, Defendantsâ€™ convictions were improper.[30]\r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Regulation 2.9, 27 S.C.

Tinsley, both of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Special Assistant Attorney General Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  David Bernard Elmore appeals his conviction and sentence for possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  Elmore argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict and erred in ruling the State could use two prior drug convictions for impeachment if he testified.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 16, 2001, Deputies Mike Rushton and Chuck Padgett of the Saluda County Sheriffâ€™s Office were on patrol on Highway 178 in Saluda County.Â  The deputies observed a white Cadillac cross the center line.Â  The deputies suspected the driver of the Cadillac was driving under the influence and pulled the car over.Â  \r\nAfter the car was pulled over, the deputies noticed several bags fly out of the vehicleâ€™s passenger side window.Â  Deputy Rushton approached the car and asked the driver (and sole occupant), David Bernard Elmore, for his driverâ€™s license.Â  Elmore did not have a license and was arrested for driving without a license.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â  \r\nThe deputies searched Elmore, the car, and the ground around the car.Â  Eight small plastic sandwich bags, each containing a green leafy substance, were found on the side of the road; one larger bag, containing a similar substance, was found in the Cadillacâ€™s center console.Â  Elmore was carrying $653 in cash in his pockets.Â  The deputies found no marijuana residue, no evidence of marijuana being smoked in the car, and no drug paraphernaliaâ€”â€œno cigarette lighters, no matches, no marijuana smoking pipes or anything of that nature . . . , no rolling papers, [and] no blunts.â€Â  \r\nTesting confirmed the leafy substance was marijuana, and Deputy Rushton testified that the street value of each bag ranged from ten to thirty dollars.Â  The total weight of the marijuana was 27.55 grams.Â  Investigator Joe Collier testified that four of the bags were virtually identical in weight.Â  Elmore was charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana. \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Elmore argued the State failed to prove the element of intent and moved for a directed verdict.Â  The trial court found the State â€œsubmitted evidence that could be viewed by the jury as intent to distributeâ€ and denied the motion.Â  \r\nThe trial court then informed Elmore of his right to testify and explained that his prior convictions may be â€œbrought upâ€ if he testified.Â  The Solicitor informed the trial court of the Stateâ€™s desire to question Elmore about two prior drug convictions: a 1995 conviction for possession of crack cocaine; and a 2001 conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  Elmore contended the convictions were prejudicial and objected to their admission.Â  Specifically, Elmore argued the marijuana conviction should not be allowed because it is â€œunduly similarâ€ and cited Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 527 S.E.2d 98 (2000), and State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246 (2000).Â  The trial court summarily noted the objection and found the State could ask about both convictions if Elmore testified.Â  Elmore elected not to testify.Â  \r\nElmore was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and sentenced.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDenial of Motion for a Directed Verdict \r\nElmore argues the trial court erred in not granting a directed verdict because there was insufficient evidence to establish an intent to distribute marijuana.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.â€Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  The trial court, in a directed verdict motion, is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its weight.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).Â  This standard remains constant even when the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence. Id.Â  â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€Â  McHoney, 344 S.C. at 97, 544 S.E.2d at 36.Â  A trial court should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).Â  However, â€œ[i]f there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€Â  McHoney, 344 S.C. at 97, 544 S.E.2d at 36.Â  \r\nSection 44-53-370(d)(3) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) creates a â€œpermissive inference to be considered by the juryâ€ that possession of more than twenty-eight grams or one ounce of marijuana constitutes possession with intent to distribute.[1]Â  State v. Andrews, 324 S.C. 516, 522, 479 S.E.2d 808, 812 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, â€œconviction of possession with intent to distribute does not hinge upon the amount involved.â€Â \r\nState v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 134, 352 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1987).Â  â€œPossession of any amount of controlled substance coupled with sufficient indicia of intent to distribute will support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute.â€Â  State v. James, 362 S.C. 557, 561-62, 608 S.E.2d 455, 457 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nAlthough we find no South Carolina precedent directly on point, we do find instructive two cases with overlapping features.Â  In State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 224, 543 S.E.2d 249, 250 (Ct. App. 2001), and State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594-95, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004), sufficient evidence of the intent to distribute was found to withstand motions for directed verdicts.Â  In Robinson, the court found  sufficient indicia of intent to distribute when the State presented testimony from police officers that a user of cocaine would not typically possess seven rocks of cocaine, that a dealer is not typically found with scales or individual baggies in his possession, and that a dealer typically wraps crack cocaine as Robinson did.Â  Robinson, 344 S.C. at 224, 543 S.E.2d at 250.Â  \r\nIn State v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 559 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2001) (en banc), affâ€™d in result, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004), this court found sufficient evidence of the intent to distribute to withstand a motion for a directed verdict where: (1) the arrest occurred in a high crime area; (2) defendant possessed eight rocks of crack cocaine; (3) defendant possessed no drug paraphernalia; (4) defendant possessed $322 in cash, predominantly in twenty dollar bills; and (5) testimony provided that a single rock of crack cocaine is typically sold for twenty dollars.Â  Cherry, 348 S.C. at 285, 559 S.E.2d at 299.Â  Our supreme court granted a writ of certiorari to review this courtâ€™s opinion in Cherry, and the majority opinion affirmed this issue,[2] holding the above combination of factors was sufficient to submit the charge of possession with intent to distribute to the jury.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594-95, 606 S.E.2d at 478.Â  The majority further held that, when reviewing a directed verdict motion, the trial court is not required to find the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.Â  Id. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478.Â Â  \r\nElmore argues the facts of this case more closely mirror those in State v. James, 362 S.C. 557, 608 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 2004), where this court found evidence was insufficient to submit to the jury a possession with intent to distribute charge.Â  We disagree. \r\nWe believe the facts of the case before us more closely line up with those in Robinson and Cherry.Â  The overlapping features include the number of â€œbaggiesâ€ containing drugs, the method of individual packaging, the amount of cash found on Elmore, and the complete absence of drug paraphernalia.Â  Conversely, James is readily distinguishable.Â  In James, two of the reasons this court found insufficient evidence of intent were: (1) James did not have a large amount of cash on his person, he only possessed thirty-seven dollars; and (2) the amount of crack cocaine possessed by James was speculative, because the bag containing the crack cocaine was never recovered for evidentiary testing and was only seen briefly by the arresting police officer.Â  James, 362 S.C. at 565, 608 S.E.2d at 459.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, as we must, we find the trial court properly denied the directed verdict motion, for a jury question was presented on the element of intent.Â  We construe Elmoreâ€™s final brief as tacitly acknowledging the presence of a jury question.Â  As Elmore puts it: â€œThe fact that marijuana is commonly sold in small packages also means that marijuana is commonly purchased in small packages.Â  With only nine small bags, the evidence is just as susceptible as establishing . . .Â  Elmore had purchased the marijuana in small bags.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  We agree that the evidence is reasonably susceptible of two inferencesâ€”one of which is consistent with the Stateâ€™s theory of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, especially in view of the commonality of factors shared with Robinson and Cherry.[3]Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAdmissibility of Prior Convictions \r\nElmore asserts the trial court committed reversible error in ruling the State could impeach him through the use of two prior drug convictions if he testified.Â  We disagree based on supreme court precedent. \r\nÂ â€œ[W]hen the trial judge chooses to make a preliminary ruling on the admissibility of prior convictions to impeach a defendant and the defendant does not testify at trial, the claim of improper impeachment is not preserved for review.â€Â  State v. Glenn, 285 S.C. 384, 385, 330 S.E.2d 285, 286 (1985).Â  In Glenn, the court adopted the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s reasoning in Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38 (1984), that â€œwhen the defendant does not testify, appellate review is too speculative for several reasons,â€ including: \r\n\r\nthe freedom of the trial judge to later alter his ruling; the possibility the prosecution may not have sought to impeach the defendant with the prior convictions; the likelihood that an adverse ruling might not have been the real motivation for the defendantâ€™s decision not to testify; and the inability of the appellate court to review any error for harmlessness.\r\n\r\nGlenn, 285 S.C. at 385, 330 S.E.2d at 285-86.Â  We adhere to the Luce preservation rule adopted in Glenn.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 9 (â€œThe decisions of the Supreme Court shall bind the Court of Appeals as precedents.â€).Â  Thus, because Elmore did not testify, we find he failed to preserve the question of improper impeachment for review.Â  \r\n Elmore urges a departure from a strict application of Glenn, desiring instead a less rigid preservation rule.Â  Some jurisdictions have declined to follow the Luce preservation rule.Â  See generally State v. Galmore, 994 S.W.2d 120, 123-25 (Tenn. 1999) (discussing, for states that have not adopted the Luce preservation rule, the two primary alternative approaches to preserving a challenge to a trial courtâ€™s pre-testimony decision on admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes).Â  As an error correction court, we leave it to our supreme court to determine if a retreat from Glenn is warranted.Â  \r\nWe take this opportunity to remind and caution the bench and bar of the inherent prejudice that flows from the use of similar prior convictions for impeachment purposes under Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE. The trial court, in weighing the probative value of prior convictions pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE,[4] should consider all relevant factors including but not limited to: â€œ1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; 2) the point in time of the conviction and the witnessâ€™s subsequent history; 3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime; 4) the importance of the defendantâ€™s testimony; and 5) the centrality of the credibility issue.â€Â  State v. Bryant, 356 S.C. 485, 490, 589 S.E.2d 775, 777-78 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  The current state of the law does not mandate the trial court make an on-the-record specific finding â€œas long as the record reveals that the trial judge did engage in a meaningful balancing of the probative value and the prejudicial effect before admitting a non-609(a)(2) prior conviction under 609(a)(1).â€Â  State v. Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 341, 529 S.E.2d 71, 75 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  However, as we have urged trial courts, when balancing the probative value of a prior conviction under Rule 609(a)(1) against the prejudicial effect, meaningful appellate review is best achieved when the trial court â€œarticulate[s] its ruling and the basis for it.â€Â  Id. at 342, 529 S.E.2d at 75.Â  \r\nAn on-the-record analysis is especially needed when undertaking a balancing that involves a prior similar offense under Rule 609(a)(1).Â  This is because the â€œthe danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from impeachment by that prior offense weighs against its admission.â€Â  State v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 542, 579 S.E.2d 318, 320 (2003); see also, Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 434, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000) (finding trial counselâ€™s failure to argue that the prejudicial effect of the convictions outweighed their probative value constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudiced the defendant).Â  Indeed, the similarity of a prior crime to the crime charged heightens the prejudicial value of the crime.Â  State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 628, 525 S.E.2d 246, 249 (2000).Â  Moreover, for prior similar convictions involving violations of narcotics laws, the prejudicial value is further increased as such violations â€œare generally not probative of truthfulness,â€ and â€œthis relative lack of probative value should figure prominently in the weighing of prejudice.â€Â  Dunlap, 353 S.C. at 542, 579 S.E.2d at 320.Â  Thus, we strongly encourage trial courts to engage in an on-the-record analysis when admitting such convictions because of the presumption against their admission.[5] Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly denied Elmoreâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  We adhere to the State v. Glenn precedent in holding that Elmoreâ€™s challenge to the trial courtâ€™s presumptive ruling concerning the admissibility of his prior drug convictions for impeachment under Rule 609(a)(1) is not preserved for review.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This section has subsequently been amended and the pertinent language is currently in section 44-53-370(d)(4).Â  See 2005 Act No. 127, Â§ 4 (eff. June 7, 2005).\r\n[2]&nbsp; The dissent in Cherry took no exception to the majorityâ€™s analysis on the directed verdict issue.Â  361 S.C. at 602-06, 606 S.E.2d 482-04.Â  The dissent advocated reversal based on a challenge to the jury charge on circumstantial evidence.Â  Id.Â  We are not presented with any challenge to the jury charge in the present case.\r\n[3]&nbsp; In Cherry, the court â€œrejected the contention that in ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial judge must grant a directed verdict unless the circumstantial evidence pointed conclusively to the defendantâ€™s guilt, to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.â€Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478, (citing State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 895, 110 S. Ct. 246, 107 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1989)).\r\n[4]&nbsp; We recognize that under a precedent of this court, the use of a prior conviction under Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE, does not require a probative value versus prejudice analysis.Â  State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 425-27, 578 S.E.2d 32, 43-44 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n[5]&nbsp; One permissible approach, advocated by the United States Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, is to allow the prosecutor to ask the witness about the existence of a prior similar conviction under Rule 609(a)(1) without disclosing to the jury the nature of the prior offense.Â  See United States v. Boyce, 611 F.2d 530, 531 n.1 (4th Cir. 1979).Â  The Boyce approach was approvingly referenced by our supreme court in Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433 n.5, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 n.5 (2000).Â  The Boyce approach still requires a meaningful balancing of the probative value and prejudicial effect before admission of the prior conviction, although the prejudice occasioned by the similarity of the prior crime to the crime charged is removed.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4083","title":"Gadson v.

Gadson had reached maximum medical improvement and was entitled to permanent disability benefits.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn September of 1997, Kathleen Gadson began working for Mikasa in Charleston, South Carolina.Â  On January 8, 1998, Gadson sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment.Â  She was injured while unloading some boxes.Â  Since January of 1998, Dr. Jeffrey K. Wingate, a spine surgeon with the Carolina Spine Institute, has been her primary treating physician.Â  The single commissioner found Gadson had injuries to her abdomen and lower back.Â  She was awarded temporary total disability and permanent partial disability of ten percent for loss of use and disability to her back.\r\nSubsequently, Gadson filed a Form 50 alleging a material change in her condition and requesting additional benefits.Â  The single commissioner found that Gadson had experienced a material change in her condition entitling her to additional benefits under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90.Â  Mikasa was required to be responsible for Dr. Wingateâ€™s medical bills and to provide medical care through Dr. Wingate.Â  The appellate panel affirmed the single commissioner.\r\nFollowing two surgical procedures by Dr. Wingate and the assignment of a permanent impairment rating, Gadson filed a Form 50 alleging that she had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI), was permanently and totally disabled, and was entitled to lifetime medical care.Â  The single commissioner ruled that Gadson was at maximum medical improvement as of May 22, 2002.Â  The commissioner further found that Gadson was permanently and totally disabled under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30.Â  Mikasa appealed asserting that Gadson had not reached MMI and that further medical care and treatment would tend to lessen her period of disability.Â  The appellate panel unanimously affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.Â  The circuit judge affirmed the appellate panel, concluding there was substantial evidence in the record to support the panelâ€™s findings.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 457, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Liberty\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Lockridge v. Santens of America, Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€).Â  Pursuant to the APA, this Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the appellate panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  See Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 610 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. # 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); see also Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.â€).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004); Jones v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 586 S.E.2d 111 (2003).\r\nThe appellate panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 617 S.E.2d 369 (Ct. App. 2005); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); DuRant v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 604 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Where there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the appellate panel are conclusive.Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999).Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of the appellate panel which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Maximum Medical Improvement\r\nMikasa argues the circuit court erred in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s finding that â€œGadson had reached MMI and that she was totally and permanently disabled.â€Â  Mikasa claims this ruling is not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nMaximum medical improvement is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 622 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 2005); Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 564 S.E.2d 354 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, the fact that a claimant has reached MMI does not preclude a finding the claimant still may require additional medical care or treatment.Â  Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 514 S.E.2d 593 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nIf an employee has reached MMI and remains disabled, then his injury is permanent.Â  Smith v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 335 S.C. 396, 517 S.E.2d 694 (1999).Â  When a claimant receiving temporary benefits reaches MMI and is still disabled, temporary benefits are terminated and the claimant is awarded permanent benefits.Â  Smith, 335 S.C. at 399, 517 S.E.2d at 696; Bass, 366 S.C. at 467, 622 S.E.2d at 585.Â  Once the commission affirms a finding of MMI, it is appropriate to terminate temporary benefits in favor of permanent disability benefits, if warranted by the evidence.Â  Smith, 335 S.C. at 399, 517 S.E.2d at 696.\r\nDr. Wingate was Gadsonâ€™s authorized treating physician.Â  Gadson was seen by Dr. Wingate on May 7, 2002 â€œas a worsening of condition for her low back pain.â€Â  Prior to that date, she had been last seen on September 14, 2001, when she was having continuing low back and radiating left leg pain.Â  The CT scan from March 25, 2002 showed a solid bony union at L5-S1.Â  In the May 7 note, Dr. Wingate stated that Gadson could consider an L4-5 epidural injection but he doubted she would need any additional surgery.\r\nGadson returned to Dr. Wingate on May 22, 2002, the date she was determined to be at MMI.Â  Dr. Wingate recommended exercise to manage her symptoms.Â  Dr. Wingate noted he would be happy to see Gadson in the future but declared: â€œIn my opinion she does not need any further surgical intervention or invasive spinal care.â€Â  Gadson was not given a return\r\nappointment.\r\nDefense counsel wrote Dr. Wingate on July 17, 2002, requesting an impairment rating for Gadson.Â  Dr. Wingate responded by letter dated August 15, 2002.Â  He opined:\r\n\r\nIn my professional opinion, Ms. Gadson has sustained a 30% whole person impairment as a result of the significant injury to her lumbosacral spine, and the ongoing pain, parasthesias and motor weakness that she has to her right lower extremity.Â  I do not feel that she will ever return to gainful employment.Â  She has a sitting and standing intolerance of 15-20 minutes.Â  She also has a severe deconditioning of her spine, and her medical condition in general.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nFuture medical expenses will most probably include the cost of epidural steroid injections, and intermittent physical therapy. . . . She continues to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and muscular relaxant medications, in combination with an antidepressant, which I think is absolutely indicated in clinical terms for her pain syndrome.Â  It is my professional opinion that she will remain on these medications long term at a cost of $200-$250 per month total.\r\nAt this point, she has no scheduled follow up visits to return and see me.Â  I have offered her return follow up on a PRN basis if her low back and right thigh pain intensify to the point that she needs further invasive care.Â  For now she will continue with the conservatively oriented medications.Â  Sheâ€™ll return to see me on a PRN basis.Â  Medical follow up will also include annual CBC, SMA-7 laboratory exams to rule out any damage to kidneys or liver as a result of her medical treatments.Â  Sheâ€™s welcome to see me back for further medical follow up as needed.\r\n\r\nGadson returned to Dr. Wingate on January 9, 2003.Â  She had an escalation in her pain â€œsince [the weather] got cold.â€Â  Dr. Wingate noted a â€œchange in [Gadsonâ€™s] overall pain picture.â€Â  Gadson was â€œhaving more intense pain in the low back and down the legs.â€Â  Dr. Wingate recommended a new MRI scan and wanted to see her after the scan.\r\nGadson saw Dr. Wingate on January 16, 2003.Â  He reviewed the lumbar MRI scan and noted post-surgical changes at L5-S1.Â  He â€œdoubt[ed] that anything immediately would be needed surgically.â€Â  Dr. Wingate recommended that Gadson do her back strengthening and stabilization exercises and continue her medications.Â  He asked Gadson to return in two months.\r\nGadsonâ€™s last appointment with Dr. Wingate before the hearing was March 19, 2003.Â  Dr. Wingate noted the CT scan showed solid fusion even after the removal of her pedicle screws.Â  He declared: â€œUnfortunately, I have very little to offer [Gadson].Â  There is nothing focal on her exam today.Â  She has no new specific nerve pain or specific muscle weakness in either arm or leg.â€Â  Dr. Wingate suggested Gadson stay on her medication and come back to see him in four to six months.Â  He stated Gadsonâ€™s primary physician should continue to provide her pain medications.\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record that Gadson reached MMI as of May 22, 2002, and was totally and permanently disabled.Â  MMI is a factual determination left to the discretion of the appellate panel.Â  On May 22, 2002, Dr. Wingate released Gadson to be seen on a PRN basis.Â  At that time, Dr. Wingate found Gadson had her hardware removed and she was going to need long term narcotics.Â  He did not schedule her for a return appointment.Â  He noted that she had no scheduled follow-up visits.Â  According to Dr. Wingate, Gadson was not a candidate for any further surgical intervention or invasive spinal care, although it was anticipated that she would be having some ongoing medical care to include injections and possibly physical therapy.Â  The continued treatment was nothing more than maintenance care to maintain Gadsonâ€™s condition.Â  Her last MRI did not reveal that there was any further active medical treatment that could be done.Â  Dr. Wingate gave Gadson an impairment rating. Â He found Gadson would never be able to return to gainful employment and that she had a severe sitting and standing intolerance of fifteen to twenty minutes.Â  In January of 2003, Gadson had temporal escalation in her pain, which was to be expected.Â  Two months later, Dr. Wingate again noted he had nothing further to offer her.Â  Although Dr. Wingate did not specifically say that Gadson reached MMI, it is obvious from his report that he rated her, did not give her a return appointment and noted that she had permanent impairment and disability that would prevent her from being able to work in the future.Â  Nothing in Dr. Wingateâ€™s later notes or records indicates that Gadson was no longer at MMI or that there had been a change in her condition after May 22, 2002.\r\nMikasa asserts the finding that Gadson reached MMI is unsupported by substantial evidence, primarily because the reports of Dr. Wingate dated January 9, 2003, January 16, 2003, and March 19, 2003 indicate that Gadson â€œneeds further medical treatment so as to lessen her period of disability.â€Â  This assertion has no merit.Â  As in Pearson v. JPS Converter &amp; Indus. Corp., 327 S.C. 393, 397, 489 S.E.2d 219, 221 (Ct. App. 1997), â€œadditional medical treatment may improve [Gadsonâ€™s] overall quality of life and ability to cope, but not otherwise impact the finding on maximum medical improvement.â€\r\nThe circuit judge did not err in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Gadson reached MMI as of May 22, 2002, and is totally and permanently disabled.\r\nII.Â  Vocational Evaluation Consultant\r\nMikasa maintains the circuit court erred â€œin its adoption of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionerâ€™s acceptance of the report of Ms. Jean Hutchinson as an expert under the Administrative Procedures Act without any evidence of her qualifications and/or expertise.â€\r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Gadson submitted a vocational evaluation from Hutchinson, who found that Gadson was totally disabled and unable to work in her present condition.Â  Mikasa objected to the report of Hutchinson.Â  Mikasa averred Hutchinson did â€œnot qualify as an expert to render an opinion in the case.â€ The commissioner overruled Mikasaâ€™s objection and admitted the report, noting she would â€œgive it the appropriate weight and certainly in consideration of your objection.â€\r\nA.Â  Regulations 67-611 &amp; 67-612\r\nThe utilitarian efficacy of admissibility under Workersâ€™ Compensation regulations is salutary and salubrious.Â  Historically, the regulations allow for written reports and documentation in lieu of live testimony, concomitantly saving time and expense in the presentation of testimony before the single commissioner.\r\nRegulation 67-611 of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission requires that each attorney representing a party file a Form 58, Pre-Hearing Brief, with the commissioner and serve a copy on the opposing party at least ten days prior to the Workersâ€™ Compensation hearing.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-611(B) (Supp. 2005); Morgan v. JPS Automotives, 321 S.C. 201, 467 S.E.2d 457 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Form 58 requires the filing party to give the names and addresses of the persons known to the parties or counsel to be witnesses.Â  On the Form 58, Gadson typed: â€œ7. Witnesses (designate if expert): Jean Hutchinson â€“ report to be submitted in lieu of live testimony.â€\r\nPursuant to Regulation 67-612, it is mandated that a moving party provide the report to the opposing party at least fifteen days before the scheduled hearing.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-612(B)(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  Gadson served defense counsel with his Brief and APA submissions on April 3, 2003, nineteen days before the hearing.Â  Regulation 67-612(D) notes: â€œAny report submitted to the opposing party in accord with (B)(1) [of 67-612] . . . shall be submitted as an APA exhibit at the hearing unless withdrawn with the consent of the other party.â€Â  Included with the Form 58 in the instant case was a listing of all submissions under the APA, including Hutchinsonâ€™s report.Â  The regulations allow for a deposition to be taken should any party request it.Â  Here, there was no such request by\r\nMikasa.\r\nRegulations authorized by the legislature have the force of law.Â  Gaffney Ledger v. South Carolina Ethics Commâ€™n, 360 S.C. 107, 600 S.E.2d 540 (2004); McNickelâ€™s, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 629, 503 S.E.2d 723 (1998); Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 458 S.E.2d 531 (1995); cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-10(4) (2005) (defining â€œRegulationâ€ as â€œeach agency statement of general public applicability that implements or prescribes law or policy or practice requirements of any agency.Â  Policy or guidance issued by an agency other than in a regulation does not have the force or effect of law.â€).Â  However, regulations may not alter or add to the terms of a statute.Â  United States Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 324 S.C. 1, 481 S.E.2d 112 (1997).\r\nHutchinsonâ€™s report was properly filed as an APA submission and timely served on Mikasa.Â  The regulations allow for APA submissions.Â  Gadson complied with the regulations by giving notice.Â  Further, it was clear from the APA submission and the Brief that the vocational expert would not be testifying live but a report would be submitted in lieu of live testimony.Â  After the service of the Brief on Mikasa, defense counsel made no attempt to depose Hutchinson so as to challenge her credentials or expertise nor did he attempt to subpoena her to the hearing or to subpoena any additional qualifications he may have desired.Â  Mikasa objected to the report at the hearing but made no request to depose Hutchinson at a later date.Â  Moreover, the Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310, et seq., allows for submission of such a report.Â  Thus, Hutchinsonâ€™s report was admissible under the APA and Regulations 67-611 and 67-612.\r\nB.Â  Vocational Expert\r\nMikasa contends Hutchinsonâ€™s report should have been excluded because â€œthere is no indication that the individual making th[e] report is qualified as an expert or has the expertise to express the opinions set forth in her . . . report.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony are matters within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506&nbsp;(2005); Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to admit expert testimony will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176&nbsp;(2002); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe test for qualification of an expert is a relative one that is dependent on the particular witnessâ€™s reference to the subject.Â  Wilson v. Rivers, 357 S.C. 447, 593 S.E.2d 603 (2004).Â  Rule 702, SCRE, articulates guidelines for the admissibility of expert testimony.Â  Rule 702 provides: â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  Rule 702, SCRE.Â  There is no abuse of discretion as long as the witness has acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.Â  State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 495 S.E.2d 463&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  For a court to find a witness competent to testify as an expert, the witness must be better qualified than the fact finder to form an opinion on the particular subject of the testimony.Â  Ellis, 358 S.C. at 525, 595 S.E.2d at 825.Â  An expert is not limited to any class of persons acting professionally.Â  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 487 S.E.2d 596&nbsp;(1997).Â  There is no exact requirement concerning how knowledge or skill must be acquired.Â  Honea v. Prior, 295 S.C. 526, 369 S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThe party offering the expert has the burden of showing the witness possesses the necessary learning, skill, or practical experience to enable the witness to give opinion testimony.Â  Henry, 329 S.C. at 274, 495 S.E.2d at 466.Â  Generally, however, defects in the amount and quality of the expertâ€™s education or experience go to the weight to be accorded the expertâ€™s testimony and not to its admissibility.Â  Peterson v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 618 S.E.2d 903 (2005); Henry, 329 S.C. at 274, 495 S.E.2d at 466; see also Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 580, 560 S.E.2d 624, 629 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny defect in the education or experience of an expert affects the weight and not the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony.â€).\r\nOn the cover of the APA submissions, it stated that Hutchinson has a Masters in Education and is submitting a vocational evaluation which was performed on Gadson on October 10, 2002.Â  On page one of Hutchinsonâ€™s report, she noted that she is a â€œVocational Consultant.â€Â  On page seven of her report, Hutchinson indicated she has a Masters in Education, is a â€œCertified Rehabilitation Counselorâ€ and is â€œCertified in Vocational Evaluation.â€\r\nAt the hearing before the circuit judge, Gadsonâ€™s attorney explained:\r\n\r\nAs to the report of Jean Hutchinson, I think the Administrative Procedures Act under 1-23-310 clearly allows us to let it in.Â  Itâ€™s just a question of weight.Â  You donâ€™t need Jean Hutchinsonâ€™s report in this case because the authorized treating physician says sheâ€™ll never return to work, but the report clearly is admissible.Â  The commissioners can give it what weight they want.Â  Jean Hutchinson is someone who has appeared in front of them the last twenty years.Â  Iâ€™ve used her the last twenty-five years.Â  So they know who she is.Â  And her report is--Â Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe judge responded: â€œSheâ€™s familiar to the Court.â€\r\nHutchinsonâ€™s qualifications are set forth in her report.Â  She was qualified to give an opinion as to Gadsonâ€™s employability.Â  Any defects in Hutchinsonâ€™s qualifications go to the weight, not the admissibility, of her report.Â  The appellate panel did not err by admitting Hutchinsonâ€™s report.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we\r\nAFFIRM.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4084","title":"McComas v.

Early, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4084\r\nHeard January 9, 2006 â€“ Filed February 21, 2006Â Â Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJarrel L. Wigger, of North Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nMargaret M. Urbanic and Michael B. McCall, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n CURETON, A.J.: This is an appeal from the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of McComasâ€™ case for failure to prosecute.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSabrina McComas filed this negligence action against Chris Ross on November 13, 2002 for medical bills, lost wages, physical injuries, and other damages, incurred as a proximate result of her injuries from a car accident. McComasâ€™ case was scheduled as number 15 on the trial docket for the week beginning September 7, 2004[1], and someone from her counselâ€™s office attended the roster meeting that morning.Â  According to McComasâ€™counsel, he contacted the court on Wednesday morning to determine the status of McComasâ€™ case.Â  Shortly thereafter, at approximately 10:00 a.m., McComas checked in with her counsel in regards to the status of her case.Â  Counsel informed her that he had received no word from the court and to not â€œworry about it until tomorrow.â€Â  He also reminded her to check back with his office in the afternoon.Â  McComasâ€™ counsel indicated to the court that around 10:30 a.m. the clerk of court sent a message through the internet instant messaging system, notifying him that the case would be called to trial the next morning.Â  At approximately 11 a.m., the clerk telephoned counsel and advised that the Administrative Judge set McComasâ€™ trial to begin at 2:00 p.m.Â  Counsel attempted to call McComas several times through the only contact number he had for her, but was unable to get in touch with her.Â  Counsel even sent a paralegal to McComasâ€™ home, but McComas was not there.Â  \r\nMcComasâ€™ counsel arrived at the courthouse at 2:00 p.m., selected the jury, and indicated to the trial court that he had been unable to locate McComas, although he was still attempting to do so.Â  Counsel requested that after the opening arguments the trial court continue the case until the next morning or until such time as McComas could be located.Â  The trial court informed counsel that the trial would proceed.Â  After hearing from three witnesses, counsel informed the trial court that McComas and the doctor were on their way to the courthouse, at which time the trial court recessed the trial for about ten minutes until 4:00 p.m., adding â€œ[i]f this witness is not here Iâ€™m going to dimiss [the case] for lack of prosecution.â€Â  Counsel informed the court that when McComas arrived home at 3:30 p.m., she called counsel and was advised that her trial had begun at 2:00 p.m.Â  She immediately asked for a ride from a friend and left for the courthouse.Â  However, she had trouble finding the courthouse and was further delayed.Â  McComasâ€™ other witness, the doctor, was expected to arrive at 4:30 p.m.Â  At 4:16 p.m., on Rossâ€™ motion, the trial court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute.Â  According to McComas and her friend who drove her there, she arrived at the courthouse at approximately 4:18 p.m. and learned her case had been dismissed with prejudice.Â  \r\nMcComas then filed a motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Based on Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 175 S.E.2d 802 (1970), the trial court then altered the judgment to a dismissal without prejudice.[2]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether an action should be dismissed for failure to prosecute is left to the discretion of the trial court judge, and his decision will not be disturbed, except upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 442, 175 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1970).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcComas claims the trial court erred in dismissing her case because (1) the sanction of dismissal was too harsh given the facts and circumstances, and (2) she did not fail to prosecute the case.Â  We agree.Â  Â \r\nRule 40(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides â€œ[t]he first 20 cases on the Jury Trial Roster at the opening of court on the first day of a term, excluding those previously dismissed, continued or otherwise resolved before the opening of that term of\r\ncourt, may be called for trial.â€Â  â€œFor failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules . . . a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.â€Â  Rule 41(b), SCRCP. \r\nThe plaintiff has the burden of prosecuting her action, and the trial court may properly dismiss an action for plaintiffâ€™s unreasonable neglect in proceeding with her cause.Â  Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. Am. Motors Reality Corp., 279 S.C. 58, 60, 301 S.E.2d 757, 758 (1983).Â  In those cases where our supreme court has affirmed dismissal of actions based on a failure to prosecute, the dismissals were imposed to maintain the orderly disposition of cases in the face of repeated warnings to the offending party or multiple opportunities to proceed with trial, and only then upon a finding of unreasonable neglect.Â  See Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 443, 175 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1970) (finding no abuse of discretion where counsel was apparently in his office and plaintiff and witnesses were at work when case was called for trial, and counsel informed the court that he could not appear for hours); Bond v. Corbin, 68 S.C. 294, 294-95, 47 S.E.2d 374, 374 (1904).Â  In granting dismissal for failure to prosecute, there must be some showing of indifference to the rights of the defendant.Â Â  E.g., Orlando v. Boyd, 320 S.C. 509, 511, 466 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1996) (holding that precluding a witness from testifying was an abuse of discretion without a showing of willful disobedience when exclusion amounted to a judgment of default or dismissal).Â  \r\nOur Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has also addressed this issue.Â Â  The court in McCargo v. Hedrick, 545 F.2d 393, 396 (4th Cir. 1976) held that dismissal is a harsh sanction, which â€œshould be resorted to only in extreme cases.â€Â  Dismissal is generally permitted only in the face of a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.Â  Id.Â  The discretion should be exercised discreetly and only after due consideration of the availability of sanctions less severe than dismissal.Â  Id.; Bush v. U.S. Postal Serv., 496 F.2d 42, 44 (4th Cir. 1974).Â  The Fourth Circuit has said the trial court must consider four factors before dismissing a case for failure to prosecute: (1) the plaintiffâ€™s degree of personal responsibility; (2) the amount of prejudice caused the defendant; (3) the presence of a drawn out history of deliberately proceeding in a dilatory fashion; and (4) the effectiveness of sanctions less drastic than dismissal.Â  Hillig v. Commâ€™r of Internal Revenue, 916 F.2d 171, 174 (4th Cir. 1990).Â  See also Herbert v. Saffell, 877 F.2d 267, 270 (4th Cir. 1989); McCargo, 545 F.2d at 396; Chandler Leasing Corp. v. Lopez, 669 F.2d 919, 920 (4th Cir. 1982).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThere is no dispute that McComas v. Ross was number fifteen on the trial roster for the court week of September 7, 2004.Â  However, McComas contacted her attorney as he requested both in the morning and afternoon each day of court week.Â  She also arranged for transportation and left for the courthouse immediately upon learning her case had been called to trial, arriving only minutes after the trial court dismissed the case.Â  There is no indication McComas did not prosecute her case.Â  She spent many months engaged in discovery and subpoened a total of five witnesses for trial.Â  McComas actively pursued her case and was only personally delayed on the date of trial.Â  Unlike other cases when the trial court has found unreasonable neglect by the plaintiff, McComas simply arrived late on the day of trial.Â  See Small, 254 S.C. at 441, 175 S.E.2d at 803 (holding unreasonable neglect by plaintiff was inferable when, upon notification of the case being called to trial, neither plaintiff nor his attorney appeared at trial and simply informed the court that they would not be able to start the trial until some hours later).[3]Â  Her attorney was in attendance and presented evidence to the jury regarding the case.Â  Furthermore, McComas did not have a history of requesting continuances or abusing court rules to evidence a clear record of delay and contemptuous conduct, as required by the federal cases involving dismissal, or unreasonable neglect, as required by the South Carolina case law.Â  \r\nRoss also argues that Bond, 68 S.C. at 294, 47 S.E.2d at 374, further supports the dismissal.Â  However, dismissals for failure to prosecute are fact-intensive issues, and the facts of Bond are easily distinguishable from the facts in the case sub judice.Â  In Bond, counsel agreed to a fixed trial date.Â  Id.Â  However, the plaintiff failed to appear at court on the agreed-upon morning.Â  Id. at 295, 47 S.E.2d at 374.Â  The trial court continued the case until the afternoon, but the plaintiff still did not appear.Â  Id.Â  Though the defendants were present in court and demanded a trial, the trial court continued the case until the next morning, â€œstating that, if the plaintiff failed to appear, he would dismiss the cause for want of prosecution if the defendants still demanded a trial.â€Â  Id.Â  When the plaintiff failed to appear the next morning, the trial court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute.Â  Id.Â  The trial court gave the plaintiff in Bond two opportunities to correct his failure to appear, including the benefit of an extra day, although his counsel had agreed to the trial date.Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnder the facts of this case, dismissal of McComasâ€™ case was too harsh a sanction for her conduct or the conduct of her counsel.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing McComasâ€™ case. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the trial courtâ€™s decision is hereby\r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.Â  ANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n ANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  The judgeâ€™s decision to dismiss McComasâ€™s case for failure to prosecute was a proper exercise of discretion.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMcComas and Ross were involved in a car accident on December 13, 1999.Â  McComas initiated this action, and the case was number fifteen on the jury trial roster for the court week which began on Tuesday, September 7, 2004.Â  The case was called to trial at 2:00 p.m. on the afternoon of September 8.\r\nMcComas was not present when the trial began.Â  Her attorney explained to the court: â€œWell, we talked to her this morning about ten oâ€™clock and said she hadnâ€™t heard anything from the court and told her donâ€™t worry about it until tomorrow and we got a call at eleven and weâ€™re still trying to find her.â€Â  The judge instructed the attorneys to make their opening statements and informed McComasâ€™s counsel they could proceed in calling their witnesses.Â  However, the judge warned, â€œWell, if you run out of witnesses, Iâ€™m sorry.Â  I canâ€™t help you and what do you want me to do?â€Â  \r\nCounsel made their opening statements and McComasâ€™s attorney called three witnesses, including the defendant.Â  After the last witness stepped down, the court directed counsel for McComas to call their next witness.Â  Counsel responded, â€œYour Honor, at this time weâ€™re still waiting for Sabrina McComas to arrive.â€Â  The judge dismissed the jury to the jury room, and the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The Court: \r\n         Mr. Wigger, when were you notified this case would be called for trial?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Mr. Wigger:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         At eleven oâ€™clock this morning, your Honor.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        The Court: \r\n         When did you notify your client?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Mr. Wigger:\r\n         Your Honor, I think we made contact with my client probably about 2:30 or three oâ€™clock, my understanding.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        The Court: \r\n        What remedy do I have other than continuing it?Â  I told you I was going to five oâ€™clock today.Â  Or dismissing it?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        Iâ€™m notâ€”not criticizing your effort, Iâ€™m not criticizing your performance.Â  Iâ€™m criticizing the fact your client is not here and how itâ€™sâ€”the effect itâ€™s having on ourâ€”the whole situation.Â  You have to bring jurors in, the cost, the room of the court, the rules.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         She doesnâ€™t even know how to get to the courthouse?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Mr. Wigger:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         No, sir.Â  She called about ten minutes ago and said she was lost down here on Meeting Street.Â \r\n          Iâ€™d ask the Court, this case as far as I know has been continued over and Iâ€™ve got all these other folks down here to testify on a couple hoursâ€™ notice and weâ€™ve actuallyâ€”\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        The Court:&nbsp; \r\n        Who else we got besides the plaintiff and the chiropractor?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Mr. Wigger:\r\n         Thatâ€™s it, your Honor.Â  And I told the doctor to be here about 4:30 and as far as I know heâ€™s been on his way, too.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nRossâ€™s counsel made a motion to dismiss, which the court granted:\r\n\r\nAll right.Â  Let the record reflect that the jury came in aboutâ€”the jury came in at 2:30 and were selected by Judge Dennis and then they got to this courtroom . . . . [t]he court reporter has about 3:08, at which time I instructed all the parties we were going to go to about five this afternoon.Â  We did the initial instructions to the jury.Â  We did opening statements.\r\nPlaintiff put up one witness and then called the defendant and that was about ten minutes to four, at which time I was told they had no other witnesses available.Â  I gave them to four oâ€™clock.Â  I was going to dismiss the case if the plaintiff did not show up by four.\r\nCame back in the courtroom at four oâ€™clock and they had a three-minute witness in Miss Wease who wasâ€”simply testified about the ladyâ€™s hourly wage.\r\nIt is now 4:16 and the plaintiff has still not shown.Â  Defense made a motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution, which I am granting.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the court dismissed McComasâ€™s case with prejudice.Â  McComas filed a Rule 59 motion arguing (1) that dismissal was improper because there was no unreasonable neglect, and (2) dismissal with prejudice was improper since the applicable precedent requires dismissals for failure to prosecute to be without prejudice.Â  The court amended its judgment so that the dismissal was without prejudice:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The Court:Â \r\n         So everybody understands that the dismissal will be without prejudice, and that is based on the ruling of Small v. Mingo, a 1970 case, and I find the facts in this case mirror that of Small v. Mingo.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        I think that is certainly grounds for me to rule like I did.Â  It is discretionary, and I donâ€™t think there has been any abuse of discretion.Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe question of whether an action should be dismissed for failure to prosecute is left to the discretion of the circuit judge and his decision will not be disturbed except upon a clear showing of an abuse of such discretion.Â  See Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 175 S.E.2d 802 (1970); see also Bond v. Corbin, 68 S.C. 294, 296, 47 S.E. 374, 375 (1904) (â€œFrom the earliest adjudications to the present time, this matter is wisely left to the discretion of the circuit judge.Â  Hort v. Jones, 2 Bay, 440; Sheppard v. Lark, 2 Bailey, 576; Hunter v. Glenn, 1 Bailey, 544; Cook v. Cottrell, 4 Strob. 62; Chalk v. McAlily, 11 Rich. Law, 153; State v. Atkinson, 33 S. C. 106, 11 S. E. 693; and many other cases, concluding with Heyward v. Middleton, 65 S. C. 496, 43 S. E. 956.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcComas argues the court erred in dismissing her case because (1) dismissal is too harsh a sanction under the circumstances of this case, and (2) McComas did not fail to prosecute her case since her counsel began the trial and she was on her way to the courthouse. \r\nRule 40(b), SCRCP, addresses the calling of cases from the jury trial roster.Â  Pursuant to Rule 40(b):\r\n\r\nThe clerk initially shall place all cases in which a jury has been requested on the General Docket.Â  A case may not be called for trial until it has been transferred to the Jury Trial Roster. . . .Â  Cases shall be called for trial in the order in which they are placed on the Jury Trial Roster, unless the court in a Scheduling order has set a date certain for the trial, or, after the case has been set on the Jury Trial Roster, the court, upon motion, grants a continuance . . . . The first 20 cases on the Jury Trial Roster at the opening of that term of court, may be called for trial.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 41(b), SCRCP, provides:Â  \r\n\r\n(b)Â  Involuntary Dismissal: Non-Suit; Effect Thereof.\r\nFor failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.Â  \r\n\r\nOur supreme court, in Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 493 S.E.2d 826 (1997), enlightened that Rule 41 additionally provides for dismissal of counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims for failure to prosecute.Â  See id. at 211, 493 S.E.2d at 832 (â€œRule 41(c), SCRCP, allows a trial judge to dismiss an action, upon a partyâ€™s motion, for the other partyâ€™s failure to prosecute a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim.â€).Â  The Crestwood court further observed that the authority to dismiss for failure to prosecute emanates both from Rule 41, and from the inherent power of the court:\r\n\r\n[T]his Court has held that trial judges possess the inherent power to dismiss actions sua sponte for a partyâ€™s failure to prosecute the relevant claims.Â  See, e.g., Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 442, 175 S.E.2d 802, 803 (1970) (noting that â€œit is within the inherent power of the court to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute.â€);Â  see also 24 Am.Jur.2d Dismissal, Discontinuance, and Nonsuit 48 (1983) (â€œProvision is made in federal and state statutes or rules of practice for dismissal of civil actions for failure of prosecution by the plaintiff.Â  However, the power of trial courts to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute with due diligence is generally considered inherent and independent of any statute or rule of court.Â  Such power is deemed to be necessarily vested in trial courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.â€)[.]\r\n\r\nCrestwood, 328 S.C. at 211-12, 493 S.E.2d at 832.\r\nA review of the South Carolina precedent addressing dismissal for failure to prosecute demonstrates a trial judge is vested with the discretion to dismiss a case without prejudice when a plaintiff fails to appear to prosecute her case.Â  \r\nIn Bond v. Corbin, 68 S.C. 294, 47 S.E. 374 (1904), the plaintiffâ€™s May 1902 trial resulted in a mistrial, and the case was scheduled to be retried during the November 1902 term.Â  The case was the first on the docket, and the parties agreed to fix the date of trial as Thursday.Â  The plaintiff failed to appear at trial.Â  His attorney explained he had written his client but had not heard back from him.Â  The case was postponed until 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.Â  \r\n\r\nAgain the plaintiff failed to be in attendance upon the court. . . . The presiding judge again continued the further hearing until Friday morning; stating that, if the plaintiff failed to appear, he would dismiss the cause for want of prosecution if the defendants still demanded a trial.\r\n\r\n68 S.C. at 295, 47 S.E. at 374.\r\nThe plaintiff failed to appear on Friday morning, but his counsel presented a telegram from him which read, â€œWill come tomorrow.Â  Will try to be there by noon.Â  J. A. Bond.â€Â  68 S.C. at 295, 47 S.E. at 374.Â  The court, however, dismissed the action for failure to prosecute.Â  The plaintiff arrived Friday afternoon and moved to vacate the order of dismissal, which the trial judge denied.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court edified:\r\n\r\nIn passing upon these grounds of appeal, we feel that it is our duty to emphasize what the court said in the case of State v. Box, 66 S. C., at page 404, 44 S. E. 970: â€œOne of the strongest criticisms of the administration of the law relates to the many delays of the trial of the cases. Parties in the criminal and the civil courts should be ready to try their cases promptly.â€ Every man is held to know the law. This November term of court was a regular term. The position of this case was the first on the docket. Counsel on both sides had fixed Thursday morning as the time for the trial of this cause. Yet, when the case was called, the plaintiff is not there. Delay is had till the afternoon session of the court. Still he is absent. On Friday morning it is called for trial, and still the plaintiff is absent. The circuit judge grants a nonsuit, refusing to continue any longer. Was this error? From the earliest adjudications to the present time, this matter is wisely left to the discretion of the circuit judge. Hort v. Jones, 2 Bay, 440; Sheppard v. Lark, 2 Bailey, 576; Hunter v. Glenn, 1 Bailey, 544; Cook v. Cottrell, 4 Strob. 62; Chalk v. McAlily, 11 Rich. Law, 153; State v. Atkinson, 33 S. C. 106, 11 S. E. 693; and many other cases, concluding with Heyward v. Middleton, 65 S. C. 496, 43 S. E. 956. We can see nothing in the conduct of the circuit judge in this matter which was erroneous.\r\n\r\n68 S.C. at 296-97, 47 S.E. at 374-75.Â  \r\n Duncan v. Duncan, 131 S.C. 238, 126 S.E. 763 (1925), involved an action for breach of contract to cut and remove timber.Â  â€œOn the call of the cause for trial, plaintiff stated that he did not desire a jury trial and moved the court to hear the case without a jury.â€Â  131 S.C. at 240, 126 S.E. at 763.Â Â  The defendant insisted on a jury trial, and the court decided to take testimony before a jury, noting that if only equitable issues were involved, â€œthe case would be withdrawn from the jury and decided by the court[.]â€Â  131 S.C. at 240, 126 S.E. at 763.Â Â  The plaintiff, however, refused to participate in the case.Â  The defense moved for a nonsuit.Â  The motion was granted, and the supreme court affirmed.\r\n\r\nA circuit judge has the right to direct how a case shall be tried.Â  If he is wrong in the mode of this trial, this court will correct on appeal.Â  When the appellant refused to proceed with the trial when ordered by the court, nonsuit was proper.Â  Cusack v. Southern R. R., 116 S.C. 142, 107 S.E. 30.\r\n\r\n131 S.C. at 241, 126 S.E. at 763.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 175 S.E.2d 802 (1970), Smallâ€™s case was called to trial at 10:00 a.m.Â  \r\nNeither plaintiff nor his counsel was present at that time, but defendantâ€™s counsel was present and announced that defendant was ready for trial. Plaintiffâ€™s counsel, who was in Pageland, South Carolina about twenty miles away, was called by the Clerk of Court, at the direction of the trial judge, and told that the court was ready to proceed with the case.Â  In response, counsel for plaintiff requested the clerk to inform the court that it would be impossible for him to contact plaintiff and his witnesses and be ready for trial before 2 P.M. on that date. Upon being so informed, the trial judge, at 10:50 A.M., on the same day, upon defendantâ€™s motion, dismissed the action with prejudice for failure of plaintiff or his counsel to appear and prosecute the action when it was reached for trial.Â  Subsequently, plaintiff moved, during the term of court, to vacate the order of dismissal upon the ground that his failure to appear for trial was not due to unreasonable neglect on his part or that of his counsel.Â  The motion was denied on November 10, 1969 and this appeal by plaintiff followed.\r\n\r\nId. at 441, 175 S.E.2d at 803.Â  \r\nThe Small court observed: â€œit is within the inherent power of the court to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute[.]â€Â  Id. at 442, 175 S.E.2d at 803.Â  The case was additionally governed by section 10-1502 of the 1962 code, which the Small court stated, â€œprovides that the court may dismiss the complaint in a pending action â€˜with costs in favor of one or more defendants, in case of unreasonable neglect on the part of the plaintiff * * * to proceed in the cause against the defendant or defendants served.â€™â€Â  254 S.C. at 442, 175 S.E.2d at 804.Â  The court explained, \r\n\r\nA broad discretion must be allowed the trial judge in arranging and calling the cases for trial and only in cases of manifest injustice will this court interfere.Â  It is of course contemplated that the above rule will be reasonably applied so as to accomplish its purpose of expediting the orderly disposition of litigation on the merits. \r\n\r\n254 S.C. at 442-43, 175 S.E.2d at 804.Â  The court noted:\r\nUnder these circumstances, the failure of plaintiff and his counsel to appear when the case was called for trial constituted a failure to proceed with the cause under s 10-1502, supra, and a ground for dismissal of the action if such failure to appear was due to unreasonable neglect.\r\n\r\nCounsel for plaintiff was apparently in his office and the plaintiff and his witnesses were at their work when the case was called for trial. The court notified counsel through the clerk of court that the case had been reached on the trial roster. The only response made by counsel at that time to such notice was to inform the court through the clerk that he could not appear before 2 P.M., several hours later. We find no abuse of discretion in the dismissal of the action under the facts. Unreasonable neglect is inferable.\r\n\r\n254 S.C. at 443, 175 S.E.2d at 804.\r\nHowever, the court made a significant modification to the trial courtâ€™s order:\r\n\r\n While we sustain the order of the trial judge in so far as it dismisses the action, the dismissal with prejudice was improper. An order of dismissal for failure to proceed with the suit is in the nature of a discontinuance of the action and is not an adjudication of the merits. Ordinarily, it does not put an end to the cause of action, but merely terminates the suit itself. An order of dismissal with prejudice under the present facts was not justified.\r\nThe judgment of the lower court is accordingly modified so that its effect is to dismiss the action without prejudice; and is affirmed as modified.\r\n\r\n254 S.C. at 443-44, 175 S.E.2d at 804 (emphasis added).\r\nIn Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. American Motors Realty Corp., 279 S.C. 58, 301 S.E.2d 757 (1983), the appellantâ€™s case was dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute.Â  However, the statute of limitations had run.Â  Thus, the appellant could not reinstitute the action.Â  After serving the Summons, appellant neglected to file the document for fifteen months.Â  â€œAppellant not only failed to timely file the Summons, it also failed to otherwise timely prosecute the case.Â  Appellant took no action between August 1976 and March 1978, when a Complaint was finally served twenty months after service of the Summons.â€Â  Id. at 60, 301 S.E.2d at 758.Â  The supreme court affirmed: â€œThe plaintiff has the burden of prosecuting his action, and the trial court may properly dismiss an action for plaintiffâ€™s unreasonable neglect in proceeding with his cause.Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Company v. Fowler, et al., 238 S.C. 46, 119 S.E.2d 97 (1961); Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 175 S.E.2d 802 (1970).â€Â  279 S.C. at 60, 301 S.E.2d at 758.Â  \r\nOur supreme court has noted, â€œA dismissal of a case â€˜without prejudice means that the plaintiff can reassert the same cause(s) of action by curing the defects that led to dismissal.Â  By contrast, dismissals with prejudice are intended to bar relitigation of the same claim.â€™â€Â  Collins v. Sigmon, 299 S.C. 464, 467, 385 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1989).Â  Nonetheless, the statute of limitations will bar another action after an involuntary dismissal without prejudice if the statutory limitations period has expired at the time the action is refiled.Â  See Davis v. Lunceford, 287 S.C. 242, 335 S.E.2d 798 (1985); cf. Mende v. Conway Hospital, Inc., 304 S.C. 313, 404 S.E.2d 33 (1991) (recognizing the ruling in Davis, but finding the statute of limitations defense had been waived).\r\nJoyner obtained a jury verdict of $2,500 against each of the two defendants in magistrateâ€™s court in Joyner v. Glimcher Properties, 356 S.C. 460, 589 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Glimcher appealed to the circuit court, but the magistrate did not file a return within thirty days as required by Rule 75, SCRCP.Â  Joyner filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, and the circuit court granted the motion.Â  The court of appeals affirmed, finding that when no return is filed, â€œthe appellant from the magistrateâ€™s court must act with due diligence and seek a writ of mandamus if necessary to compel the return.â€Â  356 S.C. at 463, 589 S.E.2d at 763 (footnote omitted).Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing review, I find the trial judgeâ€™s dismissal of the case sub judice was within the proper ambit of his discretion.Â  \r\nFirst, it is not significant that McComasâ€™s attorney was present in court, or that McComas was on her way to the courthouse when the judge granted the defendantâ€™s motion.Â  Bond makes clear that dismissal for failure to prosecute may be proper even when (1) the plaintiffâ€™s attorney makes an appearance in court, and (2) the plaintiff is currently in route to the courthouse.Â  Trial judges are forced to make real-time decisions on the administration of cases.Â  The authority to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute â€œis necessary if the courts are to control and efficiently manage an ever-expanding docket.â€Â  Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. American Motors Realty Corp., 279 S.C. at 60, 301 S.E.2d at 758 (1983); see also Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 211-12, 493 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997) (â€œâ€˜Provision is made in federal and state statutes or rules of practice for dismissal of civil actions for failure of prosecution by the plaintiff. . . . Such power is deemed to be necessarily vested in trial courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve orderly and expeditions disposition of cases.â€) (quoting 24 Am.Jur.2d Dismissal, Discontinuance, and Nonsuit 48 (1983)).Â  The judge had no way of knowing when or if McComas would appear.Â  I find no abuse of discretion.\r\nMcComas emphasizes the fact that she had engaged in discovery and had not been dilatory with respect to this case prior to her failure to make a timely appearance.Â  However, Joyner demonstrates a singular instance of nonfeasance may be sufficient ground for dismissal for failure to prosecute.Â  See Joyner, 356 S.C. 460, 589 S.E.2d 762 (affirming the trial courtâ€™s dismissal for failure to prosecute where the appellant failed to seek a writ of mandamus compelling the magistrate court to file a return).\r\nMcComas attempts to distinguish the instant case from Small on the basis that here there was no showing of unreasonable neglect.Â  Ross contends that a showing of unreasonable neglect is not necessary for dismissal under Rule 41(b).Â  Further, Ross maintains that even were a showing of unreasonable neglect required, the requisite neglect is inferable by McComasâ€™s failure to showâ€”as was the case in Small.Â  \r\n Small was decided under former code section 10-1502 of the 1962 Code of Laws.Â  That section expressly provided for dismissal â€œin case of unreasonable neglect on the part of the plaintiff . . . to proceed in the cause against the defendant or defendants served.â€Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure were promulgated in 1985.Â  See McLain v. Ingram, 314 S.C. 359, 360, 444 S.E.2d 512, 512 (1994) (â€œThe adoption of the SCRCP in 1985 heralded a new era in South Carolinaâ€™s civil practice, modernizing and streamlining our system.â€).Â  Rule 41(b), SCRCP, does not specifically require a finding of unreasonable neglect.Â  Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. American Motors Realty Corp., 279 S.C. 58, 60, 301 S.E.2d 757, 758 notes that â€œthe trial court may properly dismiss an action for plaintiffâ€™s unreasonable neglect in proceeding with his cause.â€Â  However, Shevey was decided in 1983â€”after the repeal of the 1962 Code, but prior to adoption of the Rules.Â  Joyner v. Glimcher Properties, 356 S.C. 460, 589 S.E.2d 762, which was decided in 2002â€”after promulgation of Rule 41(b)â€”does not mention the unreasonable neglect requirement.Â  \r\nRegardless whether the unreasonable neglect language applies to dismissals for failure to prosecute, I would rule that McComasâ€™s unreasonable neglect is inferable in this case.Â  The Small court professed:\r\n\r\nCounsel for plaintiff was apparently in his office and the plaintiff and his witnesses were at their work when the case was called for trial.Â Â  The court notified counsel through the clerk of court that the case had been reached on the trial roster.Â  The only response made by counsel at that time to such notice was to inform the court through the clerk that he could not appear before 2 P.M., several hours later.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the dismissal of the action under the facts.Â  Unreasonable neglect is inferable.\r\n\r\n254 S.C. at 443, 175 S.E.2d at 804.\r\nRule 40(b) lucidly instructs that once placed on the jury trial roster, a case is subject to call.Â  Here, counsel was informed at approximately 11:00 a.m. that the case would be called to trial.Â  McComas failed to present herself over five and one-quarter hours later.Â  She left her house with no means by which her counsel could contact her.Â  Once she learned of her trial, she apparently did not know the location of the courthouse. Â Thus, she neglected (1) to keep open a means of communication with her attorney, and (2) to avail herself of the courthouseâ€™s whereabouts.Â  Under these facts, unreasonable neglect is inferable.Â Â  \r\nAlthough McComasâ€™s counsel did call several witnesses prior to dismissal, McComas ultimately failed to prosecute her case.Â  There was absolutely no evidence regarding damages presented at trial.Â  Therefore, had McComasâ€™s attorney rested the plaintiffâ€™s case, a verdict would have been directed in favor of Ross for failure to present any evidence on damages.Â  However, McComas did not rest her case.Â  Rather, the trial judge instructed McComas to call her next witness, and the plaintiff could not proceed: she failed to prosecute.Â  Under South Carolina precedent, the trial judge had the discretion to dismiss her case at that time.Â  \r\nThe majority opinion essentially declares a court must wait for the plaintiffâ€”the plaintiff need not trouble herself to wait for the court.Â  This decision undermines the utility of Rule 40 and the ability of a circuit judge to effectively administer court.Â  The unfortunate result will be the needless waste of time and state and county resources.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Monday, September 6, 2004 was Labor Day, and, therefore, a state holiday.Â  \r\n[2] â€œAn order of dismissal for failure to proceed with the suit is in the nature of a discontinuance of the action and is not an adjudication of the merits.â€Â  Small at 443, 175 S.E.2d at 804.Â  Therefore, the supreme court modified the judgment of the trial court â€œso that its effect [was] to dismiss the action without prejudice.â€Â  Id. at 444, 175 S.E.2d at 804.Â  \r\n[3] Small was decided under section 10-1502 of the South Carolina Code (1962), which has since been replaced by Rule 41(b) of the South Carolina Code of Civil Procedure, promulgated in 1985.Â  Though Rule 41(b) does not require the defendant prove unreasonable neglect by the plaintiff to be granted a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, we find a reasonableness standard should apply in cases of this kind, as illustrated by the federal cases on point.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4085","title":"Sloan Construction Company v.

Best Company, issued the bond.\r\nIn November 2000, Sloan entered into a subcontractor agreement with Southco in connection with the Project.Â  Over the course of Sloanâ€™s contract performance, Amwest Surety was judged insolvent by the insurance commissioner of Nebraska, the companyâ€™s home state.Â  In June 2001, the Nebraska courts ordered Amwest Surety to liquidate all its assets.Â  Upon notice of Amwest Suretyâ€™s insolvency, SCDOT wrote to Southco requesting proof of a replacement payment bond within seven days.Â  Southco did not respond to this request.Â  Sloan properly performed its portion of the Project, but was not paid the $51,937.66 owed for the completed job.Â  Sloan did not file a claim against Amwest Surety through the companyâ€™s appointed receiver.\r\nIn January 2002, Sloan submitted written notice to SCDOT of its unpaid claim, recounting its hardships with the insolvent Amwest Surety.Â  Several months later, Southco submitted an affidavit to SCDOT averring all subcontractors on the Project were paid in full.Â  In accordance with the agencyâ€™s contract closeout procedures, which require an affidavit sworn by a principal of the general contractor stating all subcontractor claims are paid in full, SCDOT released the balance of the contract price to Southco.Â Â  \r\nIn December 2003, Sloan commenced the present action against Southco, SCDOT, and others for the unpaid contract price.Â  Sloan based its claim against SCDOT on South Carolina Code Sections 29-6-250 and 57-5-1660(a)(2) (Supp. 2004), asserting these statutes create an enforceable duty on the part of SCDOT to assure the payment bonds on its projects are, in fact, obtained and remain in effect until full payment.Â  SCDOT responded by filing a 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss.Â  The circuit court granted SCDOTâ€™s motion, concluding the statutes in question do not give rise to a private action against a violating state agency.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.â€Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 201, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999)).Â  The circuit court, in a civil action, may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Id.Â  The motion cannot be granted if the facts set forth in the complaint and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.Â  Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 366, 353 S.E.2d 697, 698 (1987). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe circuit court concluded South Carolina Code Sections 29-6-250 and 57-5-1660(a)(2) (Supp. 2004) do not grant Sloan a private right of action against SCDOT.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 57-5-1660 of the South Carolina Code reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(a) The Department of Transportation shall require that the contractor on every public highway construction contract, exceeding ten thousand dollars, furnish the Department of Transportation, county, or road district the following bonds, which shall become binding upon the award of the contract to such contractor:\r\n  \r\n(2) A payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to Â  the awarding authority, and in the amount of not less than Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  fifty per cent of the contract, for the protection of all Â Â Â Â Â  persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  of work provided for in the contract for the use of each\r\nsuch person.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660 (Supp. 2004).Â  This statute, enacted to protect subcontractors and materialmen on SCDOT projects, is often referred to as the â€œLittle Miller Act,â€ as it was modeled after the federal Miller Act, 40 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 270a &amp; 270b (1986) (following 2002 amendment, these federal statutes are cited as 40 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 3131-3133).Â  Syro Steel Co. v. Eagle Constr. Co., 319 S.C. 180, 182, 460 S.E.2d 371, 373 (1995).Â  In addition, Section 29-6-250, enacted in 2000, requires payment bonds for the protection of subcontractors on certain government projects for the full amount of the contract. \r\nSection 29-6-250 reads in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) When a government body is a party to a contract to improve real property, and the contract is for a sum in excess of fifty thousand dollars, the owner of the property shall require the contractor to provide a labor and material payment bond in the full amount of the contract.\r\n. . . . \r\n(3) For the purposes of any contract covered by the provisions of this section, it is the duty of the entity contracting for the improvement to take reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate payment bond is issued and is in proper form.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250 (Supp. 2004).\r\nOur analysis of whether these statutes grant an individual or corporation the right to sue a violating state agency begins with the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (2005).Â  â€œThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort claims against governmental entities.â€Â  Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 292, 594 S.E.2d 557, 563 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Act, a limited waiver of the Stateâ€™s sovereign immunity from lawsuits, provides that State agencies are â€œliable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,â€ subject to certain limitations and exemptions provided in the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005).Â  \r\nWhen the Act is applied to the present facts, it is clear Sloan has no right to sue under the South Carolina Tort Claims Actâ€™s limited waiver of sovereign immunity.Â  Because the â€œLittle Miller Actâ€ and section 29-6-250 deal solely with government contracts, a private individual would never be in a position to require these statutorily mandated bonds, and thus could never be liable for the failure to require them.Â  See, e.g., Arvanis v. Noslo Engâ€™g Consultants, Inc., 739 F.2d 1287, 1290 (7th Cir. 1984); Hardaway Co. v. United States Army Corps of Engâ€™rs, 980 F.2d 1415, 1416-1417 &amp; n.3 (11th Cir. 1993) (adopting this rationale regarding the federal Miller Act and Federal Tort Claims Act and acknowledging the application of similar analyses by the Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits).Â  Because a private individual could never be liable under the bonding statutes, the South Carolina Tort Claims Actâ€™s limited waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to suits brought against the government under the statutes in question.Â  \r\nWe move now to the issue of whether South Carolinaâ€™s statutory bonding scheme, in itself, constitutes a waiver of SCDOTâ€™s sovereign immunity from suit.Â  Because the â€œLittle Miller Actâ€ is patterned after the federal Miller Act, cases construing the federal Miller Act, absent a contrary expression of legislative intent, will be given great weight in the interpretation of its South Carolina counterpart.Â  Syro Steel Co., 319 S.C. at 182, 460 S.E.2d at 373.Â  Federal cases construing the federal Miller Act are nearly unanimous in their interpretation.Â  Under federal law, failure of a government agency to follow the bonding requirements of the Miller Act, without other authority evincing a waiver of sovereign immunity, does not give rise to a private right of action against the agency.Â  See, e.g., Active Fire Sprinkler Corp. v. United States Postal Service, 811 F.2d 747, 752-753 (2nd Cir. 1987) (â€œThe Miller Act does not provide subcontractors with a right of recovery against the United States.â€); Arvanis, 739 F.2d at 1290 (â€œ[In the Miller Act] [t]here is clearly no waiver of sovereign immunity.â€); Devlin Lumber &amp; Supply Corp. v. United States, 488 F.2d 88, 89 (4th Cir. 1973) (â€œ[A] violation of the Miller Act does not create liability on the part of the government . . . .); Acousti Engâ€™g Co. of Florida v. United States, 15 Cl. Ct. 698, 701 (Cl. Ct. 1988) (â€œThe Miller Act does not give subcontractors a substantive right to directly sue the United States for monies owed by [a] prime contractor.â€).\r\nAs there is no clear expression of legislative intent in South Carolina contrary to the interpretation of the federal Miller Act applied by the federal courts, we likewise conclude the statutes do not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity and that a violation of our own statutory bonding scheme does not give rise to a private right of action against a state agency.[1]Â  In doing so, we share the concern of the circuit court judge that â€œsuch a result is at odds with the overall goal of Miller Act type legislation â€“ i.e., the protection of subcontractors who have no right to lien on government work.â€Â  Nevertheless, as stated by Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals:\r\n\r\nâ€œ[t]here does seem to be a gap in the statute; there is no provision for the contingency that both the contractor and the government contracting officer will ignore the bonding requirement.Â  However, this is not a gap that we can fill with a remedy . . . .â€\r\n\r\nArvanis, 739 F.2d at 1290.Â  Should the General Assembly desire South Carolinaâ€™s bonding scheme on state projects to allow private suits against the government, the statutes could easily call for such.Â  See, e.g., Kelly Energy Systems, Inc. v. Brd. of Commissioners of Clarke County, 396 S.E.2d 498, 499-500 (Ga. App. 1990) (â€œ[the Georgia bonding statute] provides that the governing body for which the work is done shall be liable to all materialmen for any loss resulting from the failure to require a payment bond.â€). \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of SCDOTâ€™s motion to dismiss is\r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because we decide this case on the grounds that South Carolinaâ€™s bonding scheme on state projects does not grant a subcontractor the right to bring a private action against a violating state agency, we need not address whether SCDOT complied with the statutes in question under the present facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4086","title":"Earl v.

Nichols, of Columbia, Kenneth W. Harrell, of North Charleston, and Stephen L. Brown and Wallace G. Holland, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Ace USA Insurance Company of North America (INA) appeals the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s order, affirmed by the circuit court, finding insurance coverage for HTH Associates, Inc. under an INA policy.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n In 1992, HTH purchased a one-year workersâ€™ compensation insurance policy from INA.Â  On April 5, 1992, pursuant to regulatory requirements, INA electronically submitted the policy C35274522 to the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).Â  INA then mailed a hard copy of the policy to NCCI.Â  The hard copy identified the policy as number WOCC35274522.Â  The only difference between the two filings was the prefix â€œWOCâ€ in the policy number of the hard copy.Â  NCCIâ€™s computer system registered HTH as having two separate active policies.Â  \r\nIn 1993, HTH learned it was not required to provide workersâ€™ compensation coverage and decided not to renew the INA policy.Â  However, because HTH had initially elected coverage, Regulation 67-404 required HTH to file a Form 38 Notice of Withdrawal.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-404 (1990).Â  The failure to submit a Form 38 results in a company still operating under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and subjects the company to possible sanctions.Â  Id.Â  HTH never filed a Form 38.Â  \r\nWhen HTH failed to renew the INA policy, INA, pursuant to Regulation 67-406, filed a notice of termination directly with the NCCI.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406 (Supp. 2005).Â  INA correctly canceled policy number C35274522, and the termination became effective May 11, 1993.Â  INA believed it had canceled HTHâ€™s sole policy.Â  However, according to the NCCI computer system, the WOCC35274522 policy was still in effect. Â \r\nIn 2000, Curtis Earl, an employee of HTH, was in a work-related automobile accident.[1] Â At the time, HTH was engaged in the business of setting up new stores for Advance Auto Parts all over the southeastern United States.Â  Gary Smith, the Director of Coverage and Compliance at the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, investigated coverage.Â  On the initial hearing notice, Smith indicated HTH had no coverage.Â  Upon further investigation, Smith concluded HTH had coverage under the policy identified in the records of the NCCI as WOCC35274522.Â  \r\nEarl filed this action against HTH, Advance and its insurer, Royal Insurance Company of America, and the South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund.Â  Earl alleged HTH was his employer and was subject to the Act, the INA policy provided HTH with coverage, and the Royal Insurance policy also provided coverage based on Earlâ€™s statutory employment with Advance. \r\nThe single commissioner found, inter alia, HTH was subject to the Act and Earl was HTHâ€™s employee.Â  The commissioner also found INA failed to properly cancel policy WOCC35274522, and therefore, the policy was still in effect.Â  The commissioner found INA liable for all payments related to Earlâ€™s injuries.Â  The full commission affirmed, adopting the commissionerâ€™s findings in full.Â  However, the commission made the additional finding that Advance was Earlâ€™s statutory employer and Royal Insurance would cover Earlâ€™s injuries if, on appeal, the court found no coverage under any INA policy.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  INA appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing which of two carriers provided insurance in a workerâ€™s compensation action, our supreme court applied the following standard of review:\r\n\r\n  Review of a decision of the workersâ€™ compensation commission is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Although this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, it may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law. \r\n\r\nRodriguez v. Romero,&nbsp;363 S.C. 80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490&nbsp;(2005) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n INA contends it properly canceled HTHâ€™s sole policy and thus INA provided no coverage at the time of Earlâ€™s accident.Â  We disagree.Â  Pursuant to Regulation 67-406(A), the NCCI is the commissionâ€™s â€œauthorized agentâ€ for filing a report of coverage and notice of termination.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(A) (Supp. 2005). Â Notice of termination of a policy must be filed as specified in the regulations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(E) (Supp. 2005).Â  Regulation 67-406 provides:\r\n\r\n  B.Â  The insurance carrier shall file a report of coverage and notice of termination directly with the NCCI.Â  The date of receipt by the NCCI is deemed the date of filing with the Commission.\r\n  F.Â  To cancel workersâ€™ compensation insurance coverage, not to renew workersâ€™ compensation insurance coverage, or to reinstate a workersâ€™ compensation insurance policy, the insurance carrier shall file with the NCCI an NCCI Form WC 89 06 09 A.\r\n  \r\n          (1)Â  The insurance carrier may file this notice with the NCCI thirty or more days before the effective date.\r\n     (2)Â  Insurance expiration, termination or cancellation shall not be effective until after thirty days from the date of receipt by NCCI of the NCCI Form WC 89 06 09 A.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406 (Supp. 2005).Â  An insurance policy is deemed continuous until a notice of cancellation is filed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406 (E) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nSeveral rules of statutory construction compel us to affirm the circuit court.Â  First, workersâ€™ compensation statutes and regulations are to be construed liberally in favor of coverage.Â  See Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 22, 416 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1992).Â  Second, because workersâ€™ compensation is a creature of statute, â€œwe are bound to strictly construe the terms of the statute . . . .â€Â  Brown v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 441, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003).Â  Finally, the decision of an administrative agency interpreting its own regulations is given great deference.Â  Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 491, 458 S.E.2d 531, 532 (1995).Â  Under a strict interpretation of the regulations, construing them in favor of coverage, and reviewing the commissionâ€™s own interpretation of the regulations, we find INA failed to notify the NCCI of the cancellation of the policy identified by INA as WOCC35274522.Â  Gary Smith, the Director of the Coverage and Compliance Department of the commission, testified that if policy WOCC35274522 had been canceled in the NCCI records, his department would have initiated a non-compliance investigation due to HTHâ€™s failure to file a Form 38.Â  Smith admitted this case presented an anomaly, and it was his personal opinion the two policy numbers referred to the same policy.Â  Smith further acknowledged INA would not have known that two different policies had been set up unless it requested a listing of all its open policies.Â  Smith concluded, however, that there is no regulatory provision requiring an employer actually pay premiums and no provision protecting a carrier in the event of a clerical error.Â  Smith ultimately concluded on behalf of the commission that the WOC policy was not canceled pursuant to the regulations.Â  \r\nWe find other support for our decision.Â  For instance, in Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, the authors conclude the requirements for canceling a workersâ€™ compensation insurance policy are exacting and strictly construed because of the â€œessential role of insurance in the compensation process, and the serious potential effects of noninsurance on both employer and employee . . . .â€Â  9 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 150.03 (2005).Â  An insurerâ€™s failure to strictly comply with the regulations renders a termination ineffective.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLikewise, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals addressed a nearly identical issue under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workerâ€™s Act in Scott v. Hoage, 73 F.2d 114 (D.C. App. 1934), and found coverage.Â  In Scott, the insurance carrier misstated the policy number in its notice of cancellation.Â  Scott, 73 F.2d at 115.Â  The recipient clerk filed the cancellation notice, assuming a same-numbered policy was forthcoming.Â  A policy with the erroneous number never arrived, and the original policy was never canceled.Â  Finding the policy still in effect the court stated:\r\n\r\n  It is probable that the mistake in numbers was the result of clerical error only.Â  Nevertheless we think that misdescription of the policy number in the notice vitiates it.Â  The duty rests upon the company to send a correct notice, and inasmuch as it failed to do so in this case, it did not accomplish the purpose for which it was sent.\r\n\r\nId. at 117.Â  We likewise find INAâ€™s notice failed to cancel policy WOCC35274522.Â  \r\nFinally, we find the most equitable result in this case is to charge the party responsible for the mistake, INA.Â  INAâ€™s hard copy notification designating coverage under policy WOCC35274522, after its electronic notification of policy number C35274522, caused the error.Â  Smith testified the commission uses the NCCI computer system as authority for determining whether a policy exists or whether it has been canceled.Â  If the NCCI computer had not shown coverage under policy WOCC35274522, the commission would have filed noncompliance proceedings against HTH for failure to file a Form 38.Â  However, because the NCCI computer listed HTH as covered under the WOCC35274522 policy, no proceedings were initiated.Â  In short, INA created the problem by submitting the same policy twice, identified by two different numbers.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â In 2002, Earl died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.\r\n[2] Â Although insurers do not usually request all their open policies from the NCCI, Smith testified that had INA made the request it would have known the policy for HTH was still in effect.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4087","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Â Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Michael Brian Flynn appeals following convictions for burglary in the first degree, two counts of armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Specifically, Flynn argues the trial court erred in failing to find that the State violated Batson v. Kentucky[1] by using five peremptory strikes to remove black females from his jury.\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter the jury was qualified, Flynnâ€™s counsel raised a Batson challenge based on the fact that the State used all its strikes to remove black females from the jury.[2]Â  The trial court then advised the State that it had the burden of presenting a racially neutral explanation for the strikes.Â  The following explanations were presented:\r\n\r\n  Your Honor, as it relates to [Juror] 124, she had a violation of [a] check law.Â  In addition, she was young . . . The next person, [Juror 76], was a person who works at Food Lion as a customer service representative . . . In her employment, she deals with complaints day in and day out, about bickering and things of that nature, and I thought that because there would be some of that in this case that I wouldnâ€™t want somebody in that kind of job who is dealing always with conflicts and hassles in her job . . . [Juror] 21 . . . is a Head Start director.Â  I view that as a very liberal job and thatâ€™s the reason why I struck her . . . [Juror 91] works at Baptist Hill High School, . . . as a secretary, and I thought she might have sympathy for young people . . . [Juror 154] also has a fraud check.Â  Sheâ€™s young, and she had - - she was a cook or worked in the cafeteria at the College of Charleston.Â  Between all three of those things, I moved to strike her.Â  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nDefense counsel took exception to the Stateâ€™s reasons for striking Juror 21, the Head Start Director.Â  Counsel argued that being liberal is not an appropriate reason for being stricken from a jury.Â  The State then expounded on its reasons for striking her:Â  â€œYour Honor, I believe that is a social welfare kind of program, and as director she is liberal in nature. Â Itâ€™s a liberal type of attitude and job, and that is why I struck her.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled that given the nature of the case and progress of the trial to that point, it would be possible to consider a Head Start director as an improper juror.Â  The court then stated: â€œIâ€™m going to conclude that itâ€™s race neutral, particularly in view of the fact that the Defendant is a young white Caucasian.Â  That particular juror is female, African-American.Â  I conclude thatâ€™s race neutral.â€Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Flynn argues that the trial court erred in not finding the State violated Batson in regard to its treatment of Juror 21.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.â€Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  The purposes of Batson are to â€œâ€˜protect the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a jury of the defendantâ€™s peers, protect each venire personâ€™s right not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory reasons, and preserve confidence in the fairness of our system of justice by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection process.â€™â€Â  State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 501, 593 S.E.2d 486, 488 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 628-29, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1999)).\r\nOur supreme court established the procedure for a Batson hearing in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 123-24, 470 S.E.2d 366, 371-72 (1996).Â  Once a party requests a hearing, the burden shifts to the proponent of the strike who must present a racially neutral reason or explanation.Â  Id.Â  At this point, the burden shifts back to the party challenging the strike to show the explanation is merely pretextual.Â  Id.Â  This is generally accomplished by showing that similarly situated people of another race were placed on the jury.Â  Id.Â  It is important to note that the â€œproponent of the peremptory challenges will not have any burden of presenting reasonably specific, legitimate explanations for the strikes.Â  Instead, [he or she] need only present racially neutral explanations.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the current case, Flynn argues the State â€œadvanced a racial stereotypeâ€ to justify striking Juror 21.Â  We disagree.Â  As noted previously, the State asserted that due to her employment, it believed Juror 21 was â€œliberal.â€Â  As Flynn has offered no evidence other than a conclusory assertion of racial motivation, we find the trial court did not err in failing to find a Batson violation.\r\nAFFIRMED.

Neil, and Tony Catone, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n      Charles Bernhart Jordan, of Myrtle Beach; Gene McCain Connell, Jr., of Surfside Beach; for Respondents.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  In this declaratory judgment action, the South Carolina Municipal Insurance and Risk Fund (SCMIRF) appeals a summary judgment order requiring it to indemnify the City of Myrtle Beach (the City) for refunds of monies collected pursuant to a city ordinance that had been declared unconstitutional.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn February 1996, James Daniels filed a class action lawsuit against the City, challenging Myrtle Beach City Code section 21-7(g) and the Cityâ€™s implementation of that section.Â  The ordinance stated the following: \r\n\r\n  Any outstanding charges associated with rental or leased properties or accounts which are not covered by the tenantâ€™s deposit shall be the responsibility of the property owner.Â  \r\n\r\nThe effect of the ordinance was that landlords became secondarily liable for their tenantsâ€™ water bills.Â  In implementing the ordinance, the City would refuse to provide water service to leased property with outstanding water bills.Â  As a result of this refusal, landlords and new tenants could be required to pay water charges incurred by prior tenants. \r\nOn December 28, 2001, the master-in-equity for Horry County granted judgment to the class, holding the ordinance and implementing policies violated federal statutory law and the constitutional guarantees of substantive due process, procedural due process, equal protection, and just compensation.Â  The master further ordered that each member of the class was entitled to a refund of any monies paid for anotherâ€™s water bill.Â  \r\nDuring the time of some of the allegations in the class action complaint, the City was insured under a general liability insurance policy issued by SCMIRF.Â  The pertinent section of the policy read as follows:\r\n\r\n  SCMIRF agrees, subject to limitations, terms, and conditions stated in the General Provisions, Section I and Hereunder mentioned: \r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To indemnify the Member and Covered Person(s) for all sums which the Member or Covered Person(s) shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the covered Person(s) by law for damages on account of . . . damage to or destruction of property or the loss of use thereof arising out of any Occurrence.Â  \r\n\r\nThe policy also listed certain actions as exclusions to coverage, noting in particular that â€œthis coverage under this section does not apply: . . . to inverse condemnation, condemnation, temporary taking, permanent taking, or any claim arising out of or in any way connected with the operation of the principles of eminent domain, adverse possession or dedication by adverse use.â€Â  \r\nOn February 25, 2003, SCMIRF filed the present action in the Horry County Court of Common Pleas requesting declarations that this policy did not cover any of the claims or damages asserted by the class against the City and that SCMIRF was not required to provide a defense to the City in the underlying class action.Â  The City answered with a general denial and various affirmative defenses on March 13, 2003.Â  On September 4, 2003, SCMIRF filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  A hearing on the motion took place November 1, 2004.Â  With the request and consent of the parties, the trial court converted the motion into cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  On December 10, 2004, the trial court filed an order denying summary judgment to SCMIRF and granting summary judgment to the City.Â  \r\nThe trial court concluded the refunds constituted â€œdamagesâ€ under the insuring policy.Â  The trial court also concluded the wrongful collection of money was â€œproperty damageâ€ and the Cityâ€™s action pursuant to its ordinance was an unintended â€œoccurrence.â€Â  Finally, the trial court concluded the inverse condemnation exclusion did not preclude coverage.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe address only SCMIRFâ€™s contention that the policy expressly excluded coverage for claims based on a taking.Â  We hold this argument is a sufficient basis on which to reverse the appealed order.\r\nRegarding insurance policies, the supreme court has noted that â€œrules of construction requires clauses of exclusion to be narrowly interpreted and clauses of inclusion to be broadly construed.â€[1]Â  â€œThis rule of construction inures to the benefit of the insured.â€[2]Â  Nevertheless, â€œ[w]hen the contract language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force, and terms must be construed to give effect to their â€˜plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.â€™â€[3]Â  â€œCourts may not torture the ordinary meaning of language to extend coverage expressly excluded by the terms of a policy.â€[4]Â  \r\nCiting this courtâ€™s decision in Isle of Palms Pest Control v. Monticello Insurance Co.,[5] the trial court held that, because inverse condemnation was only one of several grounds upon which the master assessed liability against the City and because the exclusion did not apply to the other grounds for the masterâ€™s ruling, namely due process and equal protection, the inverse condemnation exclusion did not operate to preclude coverage.Â  We disagree with these holdings.\r\nFirst, the portion of Isle of Palms on which the trial court relied in reaching this conclusion concerned only a duty to defend, not a duty to pay.[6]Â  In contrast, the focus of this appeal is not on SCMIRFâ€™s duty to defend but rather on whether the policy it issued to the City required it to cover damages and attorney fees assessed against the City in the underlying suit.Â  Although an insurer may have an initial obligation to provide a defense to a claim because â€œthe underlying complaint creates a possibility of coverage under an insurance policy,â€[7] this obligation is distinct from the insurerâ€™s responsibility to cover the claim.[8]\r\nSecond, we disagree with the conclusion in the appealed order that, because the master also cited the grounds of due process and equal protection to support his finding that Myrtle Beach City Code section 21-7(g) was invalid, the inverse condemnation exclusion did not operate to preclude coverage.Â  \r\nAs stated earlier, the policy expressly provided that liability coverage would not apply â€œto inverse condemnation, condemnation, temporary taking, permanent taking, or any claim arising out of or in any way connected with the operation of the principles of eminent domain, adverse possession or dedication by adverse use.â€Â  In granting judgment to the plaintiffs in the class action and ordering the City to make refunds to the class members, the master concluded that requiring one person to pay anotherâ€™s water bill to obtain service amounted to a â€œtaking of property which violates the United States and the South Carolina Constitutions.â€Â  Although, as the trial court correctly observed, the master also cited due process and equal protection as reasons to require the City to pay refunds to the plaintiffs in the class action, the heart of the controversy in that lawsuit was the taking by the City of the class membersâ€™ money without just compensation.Â  As SCMIRF argued in its brief, the violation of the class membersâ€™ rights to due process and equal protection would not have occurred but for the wrongful exercise by the City of its eminent domain power.[9]Â  Because the claim at issue in this appeal fell within a policy exclusion, SCMIRF should not be required to indemnify the City for its loss.[10] \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  McPherson v.

Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 519, 613 S.E.2d 544, 547 (2005).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit court essentially sits as an appellate court to review alleged errors committed by the agency.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Department argues the trial court erred in reversing the order of the administrative hearing officer.Â  We agree.\r\nIn South Carolina, operating a motor vehicle is a privilege of the State, not a right of the individual.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  The license to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state is not a property right, but is a mere privilege subject to reasonable regulations under the police power in the interest of the public safety and welfare. Â Such privilege is always subject to revocation or suspension for any cause relating to public safety. Â However, the privilege cannot be revoked arbitrarily or capriciously.Â  \r\n\r\nSponar v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 361 S.C. 35, 39, 603 S.E.2d 412, 415 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  As part of this privilege, individuals operating motor vehicles implicitly consent to chemical tests of their breath, blood, or urine to determine whether they are driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nThe implied consent laws of this State attempt to balance the interest of the State in maintaining safe highways with the interest of the individual in maintaining personal autonomy free from arbitrary or overbearing State action.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court articulated this policy in S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 521, 613 S.E.2d 544, 548 (2005), when the court stated: \r\n\r\n  The implied consent laws are driven by public policy considerations. Â The State has a strong interest in maintaining safe highways and roads. Â One way to accomplish this goal is to enact laws directed at minimizing drunk driving. Â \r\n\r\nSection 56-5-2950 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\n  No tests may be administered or samples obtained unless the person has been informed in writing that:\r\n  (1) he does not have to take the test or give the samples, but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least ninety days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal may be used against him in court; \r\n  (2)Â  his privilege to drive must be suspended for at least thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more; \r\n  (3)Â  he has the right to have a qualified person of his own choosing conduct addition independent tests at his expense; \r\n  (4) he has the right to request an administrative hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and \r\n  (5)Â  if he does not request an administrative hearing or if his suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. \r\n\r\nThe aforementioned administrative hearing must be held within thirty days after request for the hearing is received.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F) (Supp. 2004).Â  By statute, the â€œscope of the hearing must be limited to whether the person: (1) was lawfully arrested or detained; (2) was advised in writing of the rights enumerated in Section 56-5-2950; [or] (3) refused to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F).Â Â  \r\nThe Department argues the trial court erred in reversing the administrative hearing officerâ€™s order because Taylor did not demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the fact that he did not receive a copy of the implied consent form from Officer Hamm.Â  We agree. \r\nIn State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 6, 562 S.E.2d 472, 474 (2002), the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the trial court and held that the results of a breathalyzer test should not have been suppressed for a violation of section 56-5-2950 because the defendant was not prejudiced by the violation.Â  The trial court suppressed the breathalyzer test results because the breathalyzer operator tested the breathalyzer machine with a simulator test solution containing an alcohol level of .10 percent rather than the .08 percent mandated by statute.Â  The supreme court reasoned that because the test merely determined the reliability of the breathalyzer machineâ€™s results it was â€œirrelevant whether the simulator test [was operated] using an alcohol level of .10 or .08 percent.â€Â  Id.Â  The supreme court concluded, â€œEven if the breathalyzer operator did not use the simulator test solution at the alcohol concentration required by [section 56-5-2950], [the defendant] was not prejudiced.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the supreme court reversed the suppression of the breathalyzer test results because the defendant was not prejudiced by the statutory violation committed by the breathalyzer operator.Â  Consequently, the Huntley decision dictates that a violation of section 56-5-2950 without resulting prejudice will not lead to a suppression of the evidence obtained pursuant to this section.Â  \r\nTaylor argues he was not informed of the implied consent rights in writing as provided by section 56-5-2950.Â  Taylor does not argue that he did not receive the implied consent rights, or that he would have provided a blood test if he had received the implied consent rights in writing.Â  Therefore, Taylor was not prejudiced by the fact that Officer Hamm read the implied consent rights out loud.Â  Because Taylor was not prejudiced, the trial court erred in reversing the administrative hearing officerâ€™s order.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nKITTREDGE, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
