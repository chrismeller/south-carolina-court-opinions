We reverse.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn March 6, 2009, Mother and Father were divorced by final decree (Final\r\nDecree). The Final Decree provided that Mother and Father would share joint\r\ncustody of their three children. Father was awarded primary custody of eighteen-\r\nyear-old Malcolm, while Mother was awarded primary custody of the two minor\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe Final Decree ordered Mother and Father to share expenses equally for the\r\nchildren until Malcolm's emancipation in May 2009. The Final Decree also\r\nprovided that \"[c]hild support may be addressed after June 1, 2009, in a new\r\naction, without prejudice[, or the] parties may submit a consent order in this action\r\nto address future support for the [minor children].\" The parties never entered into a\r\nconsent order, and as a result, Mother filed an action for child support modification\r\nand attorney's fees on July 14, 2009.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 2009, the family court issued a pendente lite order addressing\r\nchild support. In the pendente lite order, the family court applied Worksheet A to\r\ncalculate Father's child support obligation and required Father to pay $1,121 per\r\nmonth in child support retroactive to the filing of the child support modification\r\naction. Because of the retroactive application, the family court found Father to be\r\nin arrears totaling $3,923.50 and ordered Father to pay an additional $224.20 per\r\nmonth in child support until his arrearage was paid. The family court also ordered\r\nFather to pay Mother $1,500 in attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2009, Father filed a motion to reconsider the pendente lite order.\r\nThe family court held a hearing to address Father's motion. After the hearing, the\r\nfamily court issued an order denying Father's motion on April 19, 2010 (April\r\n2010 Order). Because Father did not pay child support following the pendente lite\r\norder, the family court found Father's total arrearage had increased to $10,649.50.\r\nThe family court ordered Father to pay his arrearage on the same terms set forth in\r\nthe pendente lite order. Mother requested additional attorney's fees at the hearing,\r\nbut Mother failed to provide the family court with an attorney's fees affidavit. The\r\nfamily court held Mother's attorney's fees in abeyance.\r\n\r\nFather failed to pay child support as required by the pendente lite and the April\r\n2010 orders and the $1,500 in attorney's fees also required by the pendente lite\r\norder. As a result, on May 27, 2010, Mother filed a rule to show cause claiming\r\nFather had not paid child support or attorney's fees in compliance with the orders.\r\nAs a part of its pretrial order, the family court consolidated Mother's rule to show\r\n\ncause with her child support modification action so that all of the issues could be\r\nheard at the final hearing.\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 2010, the family court held a final hearing to address: (1)\r\nMother's child support modification action, (2) Mother's request for attorney's fees,\r\nand (3) Mother's rule to show cause.\r\n\r\nThe primary issue in dispute at the final hearing related to which child support\r\nworksheet should be used to calculate Father's child support obligation. The\r\nnumber of overnight visits that a child spends with a parent is a factor in\r\ndetermining which child support worksheet to apply. Both parties presented\r\ntestimony concerning the number of overnight visits Father had with the minor\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMother submitted an affidavit for attorney's fees for the child support modification\r\naction and all of the related proceedings. The affidavit stated Mother's attorney's\r\nfees totaled $10,714.\r\n\r\nFather testified that prior to the final hearing he became current with his child\r\nsupport payments and had paid Mother the $1,500 in attorney's fees required by the\r\npendente lite order.\r\n\r\nOn December 22, 2010, the family court issued a final order addressing all three\r\nissues from the final hearing. In the final order, the family court stated that it\r\napplied the following factors to determine Father's child support obligation:\r\n\r\n             Father's gross monthly income of $8,674; Mother's gross\r\n             monthly income of $6,927; Mother's payment of health\r\n             insurance premiums of $176.00 per month; no alimony\r\n             paid or received; no other child support paid; no other\r\n             children in the household of either party; 161 overnights\r\n             for Father; a Worksheet C calculation; and anticipation\r\n             that Father will continue to pay some or similar levels of\r\n             support on the children as set forth in [the exhibit\r\n             detailing the minor children's expenses].\r\n\r\nThe family court determined Father's testimony concerning the number of\r\novernight visits he received with the minor children each year to be more credible\r\nthan Mother's testimony regarding overnight visitation. The application of\r\nWorksheet C reduced Father's monthly child support obligation from $1,121 per\r\nmonth to $415 per month. The family court held the reduced child support\r\n\npayment obligation was retroactive to the date the child support modification\r\naction was filed, and as a result, Father was entitled to a $2,624 credit for\r\noverpayment.\r\n\r\nThe family court also ordered Father to pay an additional $5,000 of Mother's\r\nattorney's fees in the final order. The family court ordered Father to deduct the\r\n$2,624 credit from the award of attorney's fees to Mother. As a result, Father was\r\nrequired to pay $2,375 toward Mother's attorney's fees. The family court\r\ndetermined an award of attorney's fees was appropriate because Father was in a\r\nbetter financial position to pay attorney's fees. While the family court\r\nacknowledged that Father was more successful in the action, the family court\r\nconcluded \"this was a relatively simple case which was drawn out of proportion by\r\nFather.\" Additionally, the family court considered that Father had already paid\r\n$1,500 of the $10,714 Mother accrued in attorney's fees as well as the fact that\r\nMother's attorney's fees from the April 2010 Order had been held in abeyance.\r\nFinally, the family court found Father was not in willful contempt.\r\n\r\nFather filed a motion to reconsider the award of attorney's fees, arguing the award\r\nwas not appropriate or reasonable. The family court denied Father's motion to\r\nreconsider. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"In appeals from the family court, [appellate courts] review[] factual and legal\r\nissues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667\r\n(2011). \"[W]hile retaining the authority to make our own findings of fact, we\r\nrecognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011).\r\n(footnote omitted). The burden is upon the appellant to convince the appellate\r\ncourt that the preponderance of the evidence is against the family court's findings.\r\nId. \"Stated differently, de novo review neither relieves an appellant of\r\ndemonstrating error nor requires us to ignore the findings of the family court.\" Id.\r\nat 388-89, 709 S.E.2d at 654 (italics omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather argues the family court erred in awarding Mother $5,000 in attorney's fees.\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether to award attorney's fees, the family court should consider\r\nthe following: (1) the party's ability to pay his/her own attorney's fee; (2) the\r\n\nbeneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial\r\nconditions; and (4) the effect of the attorney's fees on each party's standard of\r\nliving. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). In\r\naddition to the E.D.M. factors, \"[t]his court has previously held when parties fail to\r\ncooperate and their behavior prolongs proceedings, this is a basis for holding them\r\nresponsible for attorney's fees.\" Bodkin v. Bodkin, 388 S.C. 203, 223, 694 S.E.2d\r\n230, 241 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\r\nIn the instant action, we find the application of the E.D.M. factors cannot support\r\nawarding Mother attorney's fees. Accordingly, we hold the family court erred in\r\nawarding Mother attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nUpon review of the parties' financial records, we find that three of the four factors\r\ndo not weigh heavily in favor of either party. We find Mother and Father are in a\r\nsimilar position with regard to their financial conditions, their ability to pay their\r\nattorney's fees, and the respective impact the fees will have upon each party's\r\nstandard of living. Regarding the remaining factor, beneficial results, we agree\r\nwith the family court's finding that Father was more successful than Mother in this\r\nlitigation. The primary issue before the family court was the amount of Father's\r\nchild support obligation, and with respect to this issue, Father attained a beneficial\r\nresult by successfully petitioning for a reduction in his child support obligation.\r\nThis reduction was caused by the family court's decision to apply Worksheet C\r\ninstead of Worksheet A. The decision to change to Worksheet C was primarily\r\nbased upon the family court agreeing with Father's testimony concerning the\r\nnumber of overnight visits and the family court's anticipation that Father would\r\ncontinue to spend a similar amount on voluntary expenses for the minor children.\r\n\r\nThe family court also ruled in Father's favor regarding Mother's rule to show cause.\r\nThe family court found Father was not in willful contempt. Father was current\r\nwith his child support payments and had paid Mother $1,500 in attorney's fees\r\npursuant to the pendente lite order.\r\n\r\nMother argues the family court's award of attorney's fees was also based on\r\nFather's failure to cooperate in the litigation. Mother cites to the final order in\r\nwhich the family court stated that \"this was a relatively simple case which was\r\ndrawn out of proportion by Father.\" We are aware that a party's lack of\r\ncooperation is a sufficient basis to assess attorney's fees. See Spreeuw v. Barker,\r\n385 S.C. 45, 73, 682 S.E.2d 843, 857 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding a party's lack of\r\ncooperation serves as an additional basis for the award of attorney's fees).\r\n\nHowever, in this instance, the record does not support the family court's conclusion\r\nthat Father's lack of cooperation merited an imposition of attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that Father was late in paying child support and attorney's fees\r\npursuant to the pendente lite order and child support pursuant to the April 2010\r\nOrder. However, there is no evidence in the record that Father's failure to timely\r\npay child support prolonged these proceedings. Father paid his arrearage and fees\r\nin full by the date of the final hearing. The family court declined to hold Father in\r\ncontempt for his failure to timely pay child support, and Mother did not appeal the\r\nfamily court's ruling on her rule to show cause.\r\n\r\nMother also argues that Father's motion to reconsider the pendente lite order\r\nincreased her costs. Father's motion to reconsider may have initially been\r\nunsuccessful in obtaining a reduction in his child support obligation, but Father\r\nultimately prevailed on the issue raised in the motion. Accordingly, we fail to see\r\nhow Father's motion to reconsider needlessly increased costs or prolonged the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nWe find no other evidence in the record regarding Father's lack of cooperation that\r\nwould lend support for an award of attorney's fees. Because the E.D.M. factors\r\nfavor Father, we find the family court erred in assessing $5,000 in attorney's fees\r\nagainst Father and accordingly reverse the family court's decision on this issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the family court erred in awarding Mother\r\nattorney's fees.1 Accordingly, we reverse the family court's award of $5,000 in\r\nattorney's fees to Mother.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 In addition, Father argues the $5,000 Mother was awarded in attorney's fees is an\r\nunreasonable amount. Because the family court erred in awarding attorney's fees\r\nto Mother, we find this issue is moot. See Nemeth v. Nemeth, 325 S.C. 480, 487\r\nn.3, 481 S.E.2d 181, 185 n.3 (Ct. App. 1997) (reversing the family court's award of\r\nalimony and declining to address whether the family court erred in the amount of\r\nalimony it awarded because it was a moot issue following the reversal of the\r\naward).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5211","title":"CoastalStates Bank v.

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND FACTS\r\n\r\nCosman, a residential builder, entered into a series of business deals with Phillip\r\nPetrozzelli in 2007. Cosman and Petrozzelli formed the company, Hanover Homes\r\nof South Carolina, LLC (Borrower) to pursue real estate development. Petrozzelli\r\nwas the managing partner of Borrower and was the \"point man\" for the Traditions,\r\na development in Jasper County. According to Cosman, Petrozzelli had a previous\r\nlongstanding relationship with the Bank and with a bank employee, Buzzy\r\nLawson. Cosman explained his role was to \"watch over the construction of [the\r\ntwo model homes]\" at Traditions and to oversee the Borrower's other development.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 2007, the Bank made three loans totaling $3.632 million to Borrower\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nLoan 203611        $2.6 million to purchase 21 vacant lots in the Traditions, a\r\n                   community in Jasper, South Carolina\r\nLoan 203613        $520,000 to construct a model home\r\nLoan 203583        $512,000 to construct a second model home\r\n\r\nCosman and Petrozzelli each signed a personal guaranty to secure each loan. The\r\nguaranties provided the following:\r\n\r\n            1.      Agreement to Guaranty. For value received, . . .\r\n            [the Guarantor] . . . absolutely and unconditionally\r\n            guaranties . . . the payment . . . of: (a) all liabilities and\r\n            obligations of the Borrower to the Bank . . . . The\r\n            liability of the Guarantor shall be joint and several for the\r\n\n            payment in full of the entire amount of the Guarantied\r\n            Obligations with that of the Borrower . . . or any other\r\n            guarantor.\r\n\r\n            2.     Absolute and Unconditional Guaranty; Waiver\r\n            of Defenses. This Guaranty is an absolute and\r\n            unconditional guaranty of payment . . . . This Guaranty\r\n            creates a direct and primary obligation of the Guarantor\r\n            to the Bank without regard to any other guarantor or\r\n            obligor to the Bank or the value of any security or\r\n            collateral held by the Bank. . . . [T]he Guarantor's\r\n            obligations hereunder may be enforced with or without\r\n            joinder of the Borrower or any other guarantor and\r\n            without proceeding against the Borrower, any other\r\n            guarantor or against any collateral held by the Bank.\r\n            Guarantor expressly waives, to the fullest extent\r\n            permitted by applicable law, each and every defense\r\n            which under principles of guaranty or suretyship would\r\n            otherwise operate to impair or diminish the Guarantor's\r\n            direct and primary liability . . . . Guarantor\r\n            acknowledges and understands that nothing except the\r\n            full and final payment . . . shall release and discharge the\r\n            Guarantor from his obligations and liability hereunder.\r\n\r\nSection 2(a) provided the following:\r\n\r\n            Guarantor agrees that the Bank may take . . . the\r\n            following actions without diminishing, impairing,\r\n            limiting or abridging the Guarantor's obligations\r\n            hereunder, and the Guarantor expressly waives any\r\n            defense . . . arising out of any of the following actions\r\n            taken by the Bank, whether with or without notice to, or\r\n            consent by, the Guarantor: . . . (iii) any release or\r\n            discharge by the Bank of the Borrower, or any . . . other\r\n            guarantor; . . . (v) any settlement made with . . . the\r\n            Borrower, or . . . any other guarantor.\r\n\r\n            3.    Waiver of Notices; Additional Waivers.\r\n            Guarantor expressly waives, to the fullest extent\r\n            permitted by applicable law, each and every notice to\r\n\n             which it would otherwise be entitled under principles of\r\n             guaranty or suretyship law. . . . including but not limited\r\n             to: . . . notice of any default or nonpayment . . . by the\r\n             Borrower[,] notice of the obtaining or release of any\r\n             guaranty or surety agreement[, and] notice of\r\n             nonpayment.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2008, Borrower was experiencing financial difficulty. The notes\r\nwere renewed on October 28, 2009. Thereafter, Cosman alleges he negotiated for\r\nboth he and Petrozzelli to be released on loans for the other property they\r\ndeveloped. As to the Traditions property at issue in this case, Borrower made three\r\nshort sales to third parties with the Bank's consent and applied the proceeds to the\r\nloan balances. The first short sale, one of the model homes, was made in\r\nSeptember 2010, and the Bank netted just over $220,000.\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to Cosman, the Bank entered into an agreement (the Agreement)\r\nwith Borrower and Petrozzelli on October 22, 2010. The Agreement released\r\nBorrower and Petrozzelli from liability under the loans and guaranties in exchange\r\nfor cooperation with any further sales of the property. The Agreement also\r\nprovided the following:\r\n\r\n             No Release of Other Guarantors. Lender does not\r\n             release or discharge any obligations, liabilities or\r\n             guaranties of any other guarantor of the Notes and\r\n             nothing provided for in this Agreement shall be\r\n             construed as a waiver of any of Lender's rights and\r\n             remedies with regard to any other guarantor of the Notes.\r\n\r\nThe second model home was then sold as a short sale in April 2011, and the Bank\r\nnetted approximately $181,000. In October 2011, a short sale of the 21 lots netted\r\nthe Bank approximately $604,000.\r\n\r\nThe Bank filed this action against Cosman on the guaranties. In his answer and\r\ncounterclaim, Cosman alleged, inter alia, a conspiracy between the Bank and\r\nPetrozzelli and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.1 Cosman also\r\n\r\n1 Cosman alleged, inter alia, that Petruzzelli fraudulently transferred assets; created\r\nself-settled trusts; and conspired with the Bank to sell the property under market\r\nvalue to a \"friend of the [B]ank.\" Cosman produced appraisals indicating that at\r\nthe time the documents were signed in 2007, the value of the lots was $4.3 million,\r\n\nraised numerous defenses, including the expiration of the statute of limitations and\r\nBank's discharge of Borrower's liability under the notes.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 2012, and September 7, 2012, the trial court held hearings on the\r\nparties' cross-motions for summary judgment. At the time of the hearings, the\r\nBank claimed a balance due on the notes of $3.299 million. The trial court: (1)\r\ndismissed Cosman's statute of limitations defense; (2) granted the Bank partial\r\nsummary judgment, finding the release by the Bank of Borrower and Petrozzelli\r\ndid not result in the release or discharge of Cosman under the three guaranties; (3)\r\ndenied the Bank's motions for summary judgment as to Cosman's breach of\r\ncontract accompanied by a fraudulent act and conspiracy causes of action; (4)\r\ngranted judgment to the Bank for $3,299,665.51; and (5) awarded reasonable\r\nattorney fees and costs to be determined at a subsequent hearing.

The Statute of Limitations\r\n\r\nCosman argues the trial court erred in finding the Bank was not barred from\r\nbringing the action based on the expiration of the statute of limitations. Cosman\r\nargues the statute of limitations began to run at the time the notes were made in\r\nJuly 2007.2 We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 1 of the guaranty provides for \"payment when and as due upon maturity.\"\r\nThe maturity dates of the loans were August 2009 and April 2010. The Bank filed\r\nthis action in December 2011.\r\n\r\nAn action for breach of contract must be commenced within three years. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-3-530(1) (2005). Under \"the discovery rule, the statute of\r\nlimitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been\r\ndiscovered.\" Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647\r\n(1996). \"The discovery rule applies to breach of contract actions.\" Prince v.\r\nLiberty Life Ins. Co., 390 S.C. 166, 169, 700 S.E.2d 280, 282 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\"Pursuant to the discovery rule, a breach of contract action accrues not on the date\r\nof the breach, but rather on the date the aggrieved party either discovered the\r\nbreach, or could or should have discovered the breach through the exercise of\r\nreasonable diligence.\" Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 377, 500 S.E.2d 204,\r\n207 (Ct. App. 1998). \"[T]he statute of limitations on an action on an absolute\r\nguaranty, which is conditioned only on the debtor's default, begins to run when the\r\nobligation matures and the debtor defaults.\" 38 Am.Jur.2d Guaranty § 96, at 1040\r\n(2010).\r\n\r\nCosman argues the guaranties are demand notes, which are due immediately; thus,\r\nthe statute of limitations runs in favor of the maker from the date of the execution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   The notes were renewed in 2009.\r\n\nof the instrument.3 See Coleman v. Page's Estate, 202 S.C. 486, 488-89, 25 S.E.2d\r\n559, 559-60 (1943) (stating \"the law is well settled that a promissory note payable\r\non demand, with or without interest, is due immediately, and that the statute of\r\nlimitations runs in favor of the maker from the date of the execution of the\r\ninstrument\"). However, we agree with the trial court that the guaranties in this\r\ncase were not demand notes because they all had specific maturity dates. We\r\nlikewise agree with the trial court that to accept Cosman's theory that the statute of\r\nlimitations begins to run on the date the guaranty is signed could result in \"virtually\r\nno guarantee ever being enforceable in our State\" and is \"inconsistent with . . .\r\nSouth Carolina law.\" Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's finding that the Bank\r\nwas not barred from bringing the action based on the expiration of the statute of\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nB.    The Guaranties\r\n\r\nCosman also argues the trial court erred in interpreting the guaranties as imposing\r\nliability on him when Borrower's obligations were fully satisfied. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"A guaranty is a contract.\" TranSouth Fin. Corp. v. Cochran, 324 S.C. 290, 294,\r\n478 S.E.2d 63, 65 (Ct. App. 1996). \"The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is\r\nto ascertain and give legal effect to the parties' intentions as determined by the\r\ncontract language.\" McGill v. Moore, 381 S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574\r\n(2009). \"'Courts must enforce, not write, contracts of insurance, and their language\r\nmust be given its plain, ordinary and popular meaning.'\" USAA Prop. & Cas.

Co. of Omaha, 269 S.C. 183, 185, 236 S.E.2d 818,\r\n819 (1977)).\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Cosman also argues for the first time on appeal that the guaranties and notes\r\nshould be considered demand notes because they are perpetual contracts with no\r\nspecific duration, and perpetual contracts are not favored in South Carolina. See\r\nCarolina Cable Network v. Alert Cable TV, Inc., 316 S.C. 98, 101, 447 S.E.2d 199,\r\n201 (1994) (stating \"perpetual contracts have not been favored in South Carolina\r\nand are generally upheld only where the perpetual nature of the agreement is an\r\nexpress term of the contract\"). This argument is not preserved for appellate\r\nreview. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998)\r\n(\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\").\r\n\n\"The law in this state regarding the construction and interpretation of contracts is\r\nwell settled.\" ERIE Ins.

Brown & Brown of S.C., Inc., 389 S.C. 299, 309, 698 S.E.2d 773, 778\r\n(2010).\r\n\r\n\"A guaranty of payment is an absolute or unconditional promise to pay a particular\r\ndebt if it is not paid by the debtor at maturity.\" Citizens & S. Nat'l Bank of S.C. v.\r\nLanford, 313 S.C. 540, 543, 443 S.E.2d 549, 550 (1994). \"The general rule in\r\nSouth Carolina . . . is that a guaranty of payment is an obligation separate and\r\ndistinct from the original note.\" Id. at 544, 443 S.E.2d at 551 (internal citation\r\nomitted). In Lanford, our supreme court further defined a guaranty as follows:\r\n\r\n             The debtor is not a party to the guaranty, and the\r\n             guarantor is not a party to the principal obligation. The\r\n             undertaking of the former is independent of the promise\r\n             of the latter; and the responsibilities which are imposed\r\n             by the contract of guaranty differ from those which are\r\n             created by the contract to which the guaranty is\r\n             collateral.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting 38 Am.Jur.2d Guaranty § 4). The court in Lanford \"adhere[d] to the\r\nprinciple that the guaranty of payment and the promissory note are two separate\r\ncontracts\" and concluded the guarantor, who was not a party to the note, could not\r\navail himself of defenses available to the debtor. Id.; see Frank S.H. Bae & Marian\r\nE. McGrath, The Rights of A Surety (or Secondary Obligor) Under the Restatement\r\nof the Law, Third, Suretyship & Guaranty, 122 Banking L.J. 783, 783 (2005)\r\n((\"The Bible warned against becoming a surety (secondary obligor), stating that\r\n\n'[h]e who is a surety for a stranger will surely suffer for it, but he who hates going\r\nsurety is safe.'\") (quoting Proverbs 11:15))).\r\n\r\nCiting the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship & Guaranty §§ 37-41(1996), Cosman\r\nargues, \"The law developed so that a guarantor may be discharged under certain\r\ncircumstances if modifications of the obligations between the bank and the\r\nborrower are made without the consent of the guarantor.\" For instance, Cosman\r\nrelies on sections 37, 38, and 41, which provide protection to guarantors.\r\nRestatement (Third) of Suretyship & Guaranty §§ 37-41 (1996) (providing for\r\nprotection of a guarantor when the principal obligor is released). Cosman also\r\nargues the Restatement provides for (1) the protection of a guarantor when an\r\nagreement between the bank and the borrower provides for a reservation of a right\r\nof action against the guarantor, and (2) the prevention of opportunistic behavior by\r\nthe bank and the borrower without regard to the consequences to the guarantor.\r\n\r\nCosman maintains that amendments to South Carolina's UCC after our supreme\r\ncourt's decision in Lanford indicate our Legislature intended to provide the\r\nRestatement protections to guarantors. Cosman argues our Legislature has\r\nrecognized this development in the law by enacting the current versions of Articles\r\n3 and 4 of the UCC, found in S.C. Code Ann. §§36-3-101, 36-4-101 (2003 &\r\nSupp. 2013). Cosman contends that reading the guaranties as the trial court did,\r\nwhich results in guarantors being forever obligated on a debt that is forgiven, is\r\nunconscionable.\r\n\r\nThe Bank argues section 36-3-605(a), providing for the discharge of secondary\r\nobligors, only applies to an \"instrument,\" which is a negotiable, unconditional\r\npromise to pay a fixed sum. See S.C. Code Ann. § 36-3-605(a) (Supp. 2013).4 The\r\n\r\n4 Section 36-3-605(a) provides: \"If a person entitled to enforce an instrument\r\nreleases the obligation of a principal obligor in whole or in part, and another party\r\nto the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to the obligation of that\r\nprincipal obligor, the following rules apply:\r\n\r\n             (1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the\r\n             secondary obligor with respect to any previous payment\r\n             by the secondary obligor are not affected. Unless the\r\n             terms of the release preserve the secondary obligor's\r\n             recourse, the principal obligor is discharged, to the extent\r\n             of the release, from any other duties to the secondary\r\n             obligor under this chapter.\r\n\nBank further argues the protection of section 36-3-605(a) does not apply if the\r\nguarantor expressly waives the defenses based on the law of suretyship, and\r\nCosman waived his defenses in the guaranties. See S.C. Code Ann. § 36-3-605(f)\r\n(Supp. 2013) (stating \"[a] secondary obligor is not discharged under this section if\r\nthe secondary obligor consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the\r\ndischarge . . . or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge\r\nunder this section specifically or by general language indicat[es the waiver of]\r\ndefenses\"). Finally, the Bank argues the South Carolina Legislature did not adopt\r\nall of the provisions of the Restatement, and the Official Comment 9 to section 36-\r\n3-605 of the South Carolina Code provides that the release of a guarantor will\r\noccur \"only in the occasional case\" and \"[t]he importance of the suretyship\r\ndefenses provided . . . is greatly diminished by the fact that the right to discharge\r\ncan be waived . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 36-3-605 cmt. 9 (Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\nThe general rule releasing a guarantor when a creditor is released provides:\r\n\r\n             Generally, acts of the guarantee which have the effect of\r\n             discharging the principal debtor despite the lack of\r\n             complete payment or of complete performance of the\r\n             guaranteed contract also operate as a discharge of the\r\n             guarantor.\r\n\r\n             Where the principal debtor has not made complete\r\n             payment or has not completely performed the guaranteed\r\n             contract, but the effect of the creditor's acts is\r\n             nevertheless to release or discharge him or her, the\r\n\r\n\r\n             (2) Unless the terms of the release provide that the person\r\n             entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to\r\n             enforce the instrument against the secondary obligor, the\r\n             secondary obligor is discharged to the same extent as the\r\n             principal obligor from any unperformed portion of its\r\n             obligation on the instrument. . . .\r\n\r\n             (3) If the secondary obligor is not discharged under\r\n             Paragraph (2), the secondary obligor is discharged to the\r\n             extent of the value of the consideration for the release,\r\n             and to the extent that the release would otherwise cause\r\n             the secondary obligor a loss.\r\n\n             guarantor is also discharged, unless the guarantee's right\r\n             of recourse against the guarantor is expressly reserved in\r\n             the contract releasing the principal, or in the guaranty\r\n             contract . . . . Thus, where the creditor enters into a\r\n             compromise agreement with the debtor, the effect of\r\n             which is to release the debtor from further liability, the\r\n             guarantor can no longer be held liable, unless the\r\n             guaranty contract or the compromise agreement provides\r\n             otherwise.\r\n\r\n38A C.J.S. Guaranty § 111, 720-21 (2008); see Poole v. Bradham, 143 S.C. 156,\r\n166, 141 S.E. 267, 270-71 (1927) (stating \"in equity[,] the discharge of one surety\r\noperates to discharge all others 'in the like relation to the debt,' unless it be shown\r\nby competent testimony that the parties intended otherwise,\" and further explaining\r\nthat equity \"construes a release according to the intention of the parties\").\r\n\r\nHowever, in Cochran, 324 S.C. at 294, 478 S.E.2d at 65, this court found the\r\nguarantor unconditionally agreed to pay all sums due and all losses the lender\r\nsuffered due to the creditor's default. The court found \"[t]he terms of the guaranty\r\nprovided that [the guarantor's] obligation to [the lender] would be unaffected if [the\r\nlender] decided to release [the creditor's] obligation.\" Id. This court found the\r\nrelease of the creditor from liability did not relieve the guarantor of liability. Id.\r\n\r\nCosman distinguishes his guaranties from those in Cochran. In Cochran, the\r\nlender loaned money to a used car dealership, and three corporate officers and a\r\ncompany guarantied the loan. Id. at 292, 478 S.E.2d at 64. A collection action by\r\nthe lender resulted in a confession of judgment against all parties except one\r\nguarantor, Ralph Cochran. Id. Many years later, the lender filed an action against\r\nCochran to collect the judgment. Id. at 292-93, 478 S.E.2d at 64. The trial court\r\ndirected a verdict in favor of Cochran; however, this court reversed, finding the\r\nten-year expiration of the confession of judgment did not extinguish Cochran's\r\nobligation to the lender under his guaranty, which was an independent contractual\r\nobligation. Id. at 293-95, 478 S.E.2d at 65.\r\n\r\nThe relevant provisions of Cochran's guaranty provided:\r\n\r\n             [E]ach of us as primary obligor jointly and severally and\r\n             unconditionally guarantees to you that Dealer will fully,\r\n             promptly and faithfully perform, pay and discharge all\r\n             Dealer's present, existing and future obligations to you;\r\n\n             and agrees, without your first having to proceed against\r\n             Dealer . . . , to pay on demand all sums due and to\r\n             become due to you from Dealer and all losses, costs,\r\n             attorney's fees or expenses which you may suffer by\r\n             reason of Dealer's default . . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 294, 478 S.E.2d at 65 (alteration in original). As the guarantor, Cochran\r\n\"unconditionally agreed to pay 'all sums due' and 'all losses' that [the lender]\r\nsuffered due to [the car dealership's] default. The terms of the guaranty provided\r\nthat Cochran's obligation to [the lender] would be unaffected if [the lender]\r\ndecided to release [the car dealership's] obligation.\" Id. This court found the\r\nlender suffered \"a loss\" due to the dealership's default, and Cochran's obligation to\r\nthe lender was unaffected by the release of the dealership's obligation. Id.\r\n\r\nCosman argues the guarantor in Cochran guarantied more than the obligations of\r\nthe borrower; whereas in this case, he provided a guaranty only for the liabilities of\r\nBorrower, and the Agreement extinguished those obligations. Cosman also\r\ndistinguishes Cochran, arguing the debt in Cochran was no longer enforceable\r\nagainst the borrower; thus, the obligation of the guarantor was not extinguished. In\r\nthis case, the underlying debt is satisfied.\r\n\r\nUnder our reading of the relevant authorities, we must review the terms of the\r\nguaranty and the Agreement to determine if Cosman was released from liability\r\nwith the release of Borrower. Cosman argues section 1 of the guaranty is\r\ncontrolling: The guarantor \"absolutely and unconditionally guaranties to the Bank\r\n. . . the payment . . . of: (a) all liabilities and obligations of the Borrower to the\r\nBank . . . .\" Cosman maintains the release of Borrower released him as a guarantor\r\nunder this section of the guaranty because there is no longer an obligation of\r\nBorrower to the Bank.\r\n\r\nCosman also argues that section 2, in which he \"acknowledges and understands\r\nthat nothing except the full and final payment . . . shall release and discharge the\r\nGuarantor from his obligations and liability hereunder\" supports his interpretation\r\nof the guaranties because the Bank's acceptance of the proceeds of the short sales\r\nand release of Borrower acted as \"full and final payment\" of Borrower's debts.\r\nCosman argues that at a minimum, the guaranties are unclear about whether he is\r\nreleased from liability when Borrower is released; thus, there is a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact precluding summary judgment.\r\n\nAs to the waiver portion of section 2(a), Cosman argues that interpreting it to\r\nprovide that the guarantor is obligated would lead to the ridiculous and\r\nunconscionable outcome of requiring Cosman to pay the full amount of the notes\r\nregardless of any amounts already paid to the Bank. Cosman maintains the trial\r\ncourt erred in relying on cases that consider guaranties with materially different\r\nterms than the guaranties in this case.\r\n\r\nSection 2(a) provided the following:\r\n\r\n             Guarantor agrees that the Bank may take . . . the\r\n             following actions without diminishing, impairing,\r\n             limiting or abridging the Guarantor's obligations\r\n             hereunder, and the Guarantor expressly waives any\r\n             defense . . . arising out of any of the following actions\r\n             taken by the Bank, whether with or without notice to, or\r\n             consent by, the Guarantor: . . . (iii) any release or\r\n             discharge by the Bank of the Borrower, or any . . . other\r\n             guarantor; . . . (v) any settlement made with . . . the\r\n             Borrower, or . . . any other guarantor.\r\n\r\nWe agree the guaranties in this case can reasonably be read to limit Cosman's\r\nliability to \"all liabilities and obligation of the Borrower to the Bank.\" Because the\r\nBank has accepted full and final payment from the Borrower, the guaranties can\r\nreasonably be interpreted to conclude there is no longer any liability of the\r\nBorrower to the Bank. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nCosman, as we must do in reviewing the trial court's grant of the Bank's motion for\r\nsummary judgment, we find the guaranties created an ambiguity. See Hard Hat\r\nWorkforce Solutions, LLC v. Mech. HVAC Servs., Inc., 406 S.C. 294, 750 S.E.2d\r\n921, 923-24 (2013) (reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment in the\r\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party in an action for a claim against a\r\npayment bond). Thus, we find the trial court erred in finding Cosman's liability\r\nwas not extinguished as a matter of law. See Progressive Max Ins. Co., 405 S.C. at\r\n46-47, 747 S.E.2d at 184 (finding a contract is ambiguous when its terms are\r\ncapable of having more than one meaning when viewed by a reasonably intelligent\r\nperson who has examined the entire agreement); Mathis, 389 S.C. at 309, 698\r\nS.E.2d at 778 (construing ambiguities in an agreement against the drafter of the\r\nagreement). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order granting summary\r\njudgment, which concluded the release of the Bank and Petrozzelli did not release\r\nCosman.\r\n\nC.    The Breach of Contract Claim\r\n\r\nCosman lastly argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the\r\nbreach of contract cause of action while also finding a genuine issue of material\r\nfact existed as to his \"defenses\" to the breach of contract claim. Based on our\r\ndisposition of the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the guaranties, we\r\nneed not address this issue. See Futch v.

Denny, of Keith G. Denny, P.A., of Walhalla,\r\n             for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: The State appeals the circuit court's reversal of the magistrate\r\ncourt's conviction of Cody Roy Gordon for driving under the influence (DUI). It\r\ncontends the circuit court erred in finding the State did not comply with section 56-\r\n5-2953(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013) because Gordon's head was\r\n\nnot visible on the required recording during one of the field sobriety tests\r\nadministered. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 2011, the South Carolina Highway Patrol stopped Gordon at a\r\nlicense and registration checkpoint. Officers administered three tests to determine\r\nif Gordon was under the influence: the Horizontal-Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test1,\r\nthe walk and turn test, and the one-leg stand test. Following the tests, the officers\r\ncharged Gordon with DUI. The dashboard camera in the arresting officer's car\r\nrecorded the events leading to the arrest.\r\n\r\nPrior to a trial before the magistrate court, Gordon moved to dismiss the charge on\r\nseveral grounds, including the State's failure to sufficiently record the HGN test\r\nbecause Gordon's head was not visible on the recording during the test. The\r\nmagistrate denied the motion to dismiss, finding the State properly captured\r\nGordon's conduct on the recording as required by section 56-5-2953 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2013) and Murphy v. State, 392 S.C. 626, 709 S.E.2d 685\r\n(Ct. App. 2011). Following a trial, a jury convicted Gordon of DUI.\r\n\r\nGordon appealed his conviction to the circuit court. At the hearing before the\r\ncircuit court, Gordon argued the HGN test could not be seen on the recording.\r\nGordon provided black and white photographs (\"stills\") of the recording to the\r\ncircuit court without objection by the State. Following the conclusion of\r\narguments, the circuit court granted Gordon's motion to dismiss. The court found\r\nsection 56-5-2953(A) requires the defendant's head be visible during the\r\nadministration of the HGN test, unless an exception in section 56-5-2953(B)\r\napplies. The court noted Gordon was \"so far out of view in front of the arresting\r\nofficer's patrol car for the administration of the test and into the dark[,] which\r\n\r\n\r\n1 \"Nystagmus is described as an involuntary jerking of the eyeball, a condition that\r\nmay be aggravated by the effect of chemical depressants on the central nervous\r\nsystem.\" State v. Sullivan, 310 S.C. 311, 315 n.2, 426 S.E.2d 766, 769 n.2 (1993).\r\n\"The HGN test consists of the driver being asked to cover one eye and focus the\r\nother on an object held at the driver's eye level by the officer. As the officer moves\r\nthe object gradually out of the driver's field of vision toward his ear, he watches the\r\ndriver's eyeballs to detect involuntary jerking.\" Id.\r\n \r\n\nprevented [Gordon's] head from being sufficiently visible through the entire\r\nadministration of the [HGN] test.\" This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal appeals from magistrate . . . court, the circuit court does not conduct a\r\nde novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate\r\nexception.\" State v.

This court will review the decision of\r\nthe circuit court for errors of law only. City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12,\r\n15, 646 S.E.2d 879, 880 (2007); Henderson, 347 S.C. at 457, 556 S.E.2d at 692.\r\n\"[Q]uestions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which are subject to\r\nde novo review and which we are free to decide without any deference to the court\r\nbelow.\" City of Greer v. Humble, 402 S.C. 609, 613, 742 S.E.2d 15, 17 (Ct. App.\r\n2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The circuit court is bound by the\r\nmagistrate court's findings of fact if any evidence in the record reasonably supports\r\nthem. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred in reversing the magistrate court's\r\nconviction of Gordon for DUI. It contends the circuit court erred in finding the\r\nState did not comply with section 56-5-2953(A)(1)(a)(ii) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (Supp. 2013) because Gordon's head was not visible during the HGN test.2 It\r\n\r\n2 The State also contends the circuit court did not review the recording. However,\r\nthe record does not indicate whether the circuit court reviewed the recording or\r\nnot. Gordon indicated at the hearing that all of the evidence had been submitted to\r\nthe circuit court. The record provides the circuit court conferred with its law clerk\r\noff the record after receiving the stills. Gordon asserts that at this time, the circuit\r\ncourt appeared to review the recording on its laptop on the bench with the\r\nassistance of its law clerk. The transcript of the hearing states no exhibits were\r\nintroduced. The State did not put on the record the fact that the circuit court\r\nallegedly did not view the recording or raise any objection to the court allegedly\r\n\nasserts the statute requires the recording include the field sobriety tests but not that\r\nthe defendant's head must be visible. It further maintains that even if it is a\r\nrequirement of the statute, the circuit court's factual finding that Gordon's head was\r\nnot sufficiently visible during the HGN test lacked evidentiary support.\r\n\r\nSection 56-5-2953(A) provides:\r\n\r\n             A person who [commits the offense of DUI] must have\r\n             his conduct at the incident site . . . video recorded.\r\n             (1)(a) The video recording at the incident site must . . .\r\n             (ii) include any field sobriety tests administered . . . .\r\n\r\n\"As amended in 2009, the current version of section 56-5-2953 expressly requires\r\nthe recording of field sobriety tests.\" Murphy v. State, 392 S.C. 626, 632 n.4, 709\r\nS.E.2d 685, 688 n.4 (Ct. App. 2011) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(1)(a)(ii) (Supp. 2010) (\"The video recording at the incident site must: . . .\r\ninclude any field sobriety tests administered.\" (alteration by court))).\r\n\r\nIn Murphy, the defendant contended \"the videotape of the incident [s]ite d[id] not\r\ncomply with the statute because it fail[ed] to 'record most of the field sobriety\r\ntests.'\" Id. at 631, 709 S.E.2d at 688. The court applied the prior version of section\r\n56-5-2953, which was in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest, and found \"the\r\nplain language of the statute does not require that the recording capture a\r\ncontinuous full view of the accused, or capture all field sobriety tests. Rather,\r\nprovided all other requirements are met, the video need only record the accused's\r\nconduct.\" Id. at 632, 709 S.E.2d at 688. The version of the statute applied in\r\nMurphy did not include the explicit requirement that it \"include any field sobriety\r\ntests administered\" as the current version does. § 56-5-2953(A)(1)(a)(ii).\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is a court must ascertain and give effect\r\nto the intent of the legislature.\" State v. Elwell, 403 S.C. 606, 612, 743 S.E.2d 802,\r\n806 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"What a legislature says in the text\r\n\r\nnot reviewing the recording. The appellant has the burden of providing a sufficient\r\nrecord. Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d 485,\r\n487-88 (2005). Generally, \"the appellate court will not consider any fact which\r\ndoes not appear in the Record on Appeal.\" Rule 210(h), SCACR. Accordingly,\r\nwe cannot consider the State's assertion the circuit court did not review the\r\nrecording.\r\n\nof a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.\" Id.\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"Therefore, [i]f a statute's language is plain,\r\nunambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning[,] the rules of statutory interpretation\r\nare not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.\" Id. (first\r\nalteration by court) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Pittman,\r\n373 S.C. 527, 561, 647 S.E.2d 144, 161 (2007) (\"All rules of statutory construction\r\nare subservient to the maxim that legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\nreasonably discovered in the language used.\"). \"However, penal statutes will be\r\nstrictly construed against the state.\" Elwell, 403 S.C. at 612, 743 S.E.2d at 806.\r\n\r\n\"If the statute is ambiguous, however, courts must construe the terms of the\r\nstatute.\" Town of Mt.

Pleasant, 393 S.C. at 347, 713 S.E.2d at 285. Dismissal of a DUI\r\ncharge is an appropriate remedy provided by section 56-5-2953 when a violation of\r\nsubsection (A) is not mitigated by subsection (B) exceptions. City of Rock Hill v.\r\nSuchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 17, 646 S.E.2d 879, 881 (2007). \"[T]he Legislature clearly\r\nintended for a per se dismissal in the event a law enforcement agency violates the\r\nmandatory provisions of section 56-5-2953.\" Town of Mt. Pleasant, 393 S.C. at\r\n348, 713 S.E.2d at 286. \"By requiring a law enforcement agency to videotape a\r\nDUI arrest, the Legislature clearly intended strict compliance with the provisions\r\nof section 56-5-2953 and, in turn, promulgated a severe sanction for\r\nnoncompliance.\" Id. at 349, 713 S.E.2d at 286.\r\n\nThe circuit court properly found the magistrate erred in finding the recording was\r\nonly required to show the conduct of the defendant. The magistrate relied on\r\nMurphy in making that determination. Although Murphy holds that only the\r\nconduct of the defendant must be recorded, Murphy was based on a prior version\r\nof the statute, which did not include the specific language regarding the tests being\r\nrecorded. The current version of the statute states: \"The video recording at the\r\nincident site must . . . include any field sobriety tests administered . . . .\" § 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(1)(a)(ii). Because of the purpose of the videotaping to create direct\r\nevidence of the arrest, if the actual tests cannot be seen on the recording, the\r\nrequirement is pointless. Accordingly, the circuit court correctly found the head\r\nmust be shown during the HGN test in order for that sobriety test to be recorded,\r\nand we affirm that finding.\r\n\r\nHowever, because the magistrate court found the recording only needed to capture\r\nthe conduct, it did not make any findings as to whether the entire test, including the\r\nhead, was on camera. The circuit court found Gordon's head was not \"sufficiently\r\nvisible through the entire administration of the [HGN] test.\" But \"'the circuit court,\r\nsitting in its appellate capacity, may not engage in fact finding.'\" City of Greer v.\r\nHumble, 402 S.C. 609, 618, 742 S.E.2d 15, 20 (Ct. App. 2013) (quoting Rogers v.\r\nState, 358 S.C. 266, 270, 594 S.E.2d 278, 280 (Ct. App. 2004)). Because the\r\ncircuit court engaged in fact finding and the magistrate never made such findings\r\ndue to its misconstruction of the statute, we vacate the circuit court's finding\r\nGordon's head was not visible and remand the case to the magistrate court.3 The\r\nmagistrate court is to make factual findings in light of the circuit court and our\r\ndetermination that the test must be recorded on camera; specifically for the HGN\r\ntest, the head has to be visible on the recording.4\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The dashcam recording that was available to the circuit court and the magistrate\r\ncourt was part of the record on appeal. This court viewed the recording, but our\r\nstandard of review, just like the circuit court's standard of review in this matter,\r\ndoes not allow us to make findings of fact. That duty is left solely to the\r\nmagistrate court. Accordingly, we will not make findings as to what the recording\r\nshows.\r\n4 Because we find the circuit court erred in making findings of fact, we need not\r\naddress the State's argument the circuit court erred in reviewing the stills.

The\r\nState contends it presented sufficient independent evidence corroborating\r\nAbraham's extra-judicial confession to establish a jury question as to Abraham's\r\nguilt. We reverse.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nShortly after midnight on July 7, 2011, Trooper Kevin Brown was called to the\r\nscene of a one-car accident in Oconee County, S.C. The accident occurred in the\r\nKeowee Key neighborhood on South Flagship Drive, which passes by the local\r\ncountry club. Upon arriving at the scene, Brown noticed the presence of\r\nemergency vehicles and a vehicle wrecked into a tree. Brown would later testify\r\nthe wrecked vehicle was a dark-colored, newer model vehicle with \"front-end\r\ndamage consistent with running into a tree.\" Brown testified he believed the\r\nvehicle's license plate was traced to a rental car company. According to Brown,\r\nAbraham was the only person present at the collision scene aside from emergency\r\npersonnel. Abraham told Brown he was from Chicago and living with his brother.\r\nAbraham indicated he had left the country club, where he had been drinking wine,\r\nand was headed to his brother's house inside Keowee Key. He also admitted to\r\ndriving the wrecked vehicle. Brown noted Abraham was unsteady on his feet,\r\nslurred his speech, and smelled strongly of alcohol. Brown administered three\r\nfield sobriety tests. The horizontal gaze nystagmus test result could not be used\r\ndue to Abraham's congenital eye condition; however, the other two tests showed\r\nsigns of impairment. Brown subsequently arrested Abraham for DUI. After being\r\ntransported to the police station, Abraham submitted to a breath test, which\r\nregistered a .22 percent blood alcohol level.\r\n\r\nAbraham was tried in magistrate court for DUI. The State called Brown as the\r\nonly witness at trial. Abraham motioned for a directed verdict during and after the\r\nState's case, contending the State failed to present sufficient evidence corroborating\r\nAbraham's extra-judicial confession to establish the corpus delicti of DUI. These\r\nmotions were denied, and a jury convicted Abraham. On appeal to the circuit\r\ncourt, the court reversed Abraham's conviction, ruling the evidence at trial was\r\ninsufficient to establish the corpus delicti of DUI. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in reversing Abraham's conviction because the evidence at\r\ntrial was insufficient to establish the corpus delicti of DUI?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the [circuit] court is concerned\r\nwith the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.\" State v. Weston,\r\n367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). \"A defendant is entitled to a\r\n\ndirected verdict when the [S]tate fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.\"\r\nId. \"When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court views the evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.\" Id. \"'If\r\nthere is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\ntending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was\r\nproperly submitted to the jury.'\" State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, 45, 626 S.E.2d 898,\r\n901 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254,\r\n256 (2001)). \"The appellate court's review in criminal cases is limited to\r\ncorrecting the order of the circuit court for errors of law.\" State v.

Osborne, 335 S.C. 172, 175, 516 S.E.2d 201, 202 (1999)\r\n\r\n1 Given our supreme court's holding in State v. Osborne, we find our state's law is\r\nconsistent with the \"trustworthiness\" approach delineated in Opper v. United\r\nStates, 348 U.S. 84 (1954). See Osborne, 335 S.C. 172, 179-80, 516 S.E.2d 201,\r\n204-05 (1999) (\"We clarify the law in this State that, consistently with Opper and\r\nits progeny, the corroboration rule is satisfied if the State provides sufficient\r\nindependent evidence which serves to corroborate the defendant's extra-judicial\r\nstatements and, together with such statements, permits a reasonable belief that the\r\ncrime occurred.\"); see also Opper, 348 U.S. at 93 (\"[W]e think the better rule to be\r\nthat the corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, independent of the\r\nstatements, to establish the corpus delicti. It is necessary, therefore, to require the\r\nGovernment to introduce substantial independent evidence which would tend to\r\nestablish the trustworthiness of the statement.\").\r\n\r\nIn Osborne, 335 S.C. at 179-80, 516 S.E.2d at 204-05, our supreme court cited\r\nState v. Trexler, 342 S.E.2d 878 (N.C. 1986), in clarifying this state's law to be\r\nconsistent with \"Opper and its progeny.\" See Osborne, 335 S.C. at 179, 516\r\nS.E.2d at 204 (\"This standard enunciated in Opper has been adopted in other\r\njurisdictions, including our sister state of North Carolina.\"). In Trexler, the\r\nSupreme Court of North Carolina held \"[t]he corpus delicti rule only requires\r\nevidence aliunde the confession which, when considered with the confession,\r\nsupports the confession and permits a reasonable inference that the crime occurred.\r\nThe independent evidence must touch or be concerned with the corpus delicti.\"\r\n\n(footnote omitted). \"[T]he corroboration rule is satisfied if the State provides\r\nsufficient independent evidence which serves to corroborate the defendant's extra-\r\njudicial statements and, together with such statements, permits a reasonable belief\r\nthat the crime occurred.\"2 Id. at 180, 516 S.E.2d at 205.\r\n\r\nSubsection 56-5-2930(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013)3 states, \"It is\r\nunlawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle within this State while under the\r\ninfluence of alcohol to the extent that the person's faculties to drive a motor vehicle\r\nare materially and appreciably impaired . . . .\" In its order granting a reversal, the\r\ncircuit court cited State v. Townsend, 321 S.C. 55, 467 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 1996),\r\nin support of reversing Abraham's conviction. However, the holding in Townsend\r\nweighs against such a reversal. See id. at 58, 467 S.E.2d at 140-41. In Townsend,\r\nthis court held the following facts merited the submission of a DUI case to a jury:\r\n\r\n             In the case before us, the state relied on the following\r\n             circumstances to prove its case. Townsend was at the\r\n             scene where his car had been involved in a wreck. He\r\n\r\nTrexler, 342 S.E.2d at 880-81 (internal citation omitted). The court held that \"[t]he\r\nrule does not require that the evidence aliunde the confession prove any element of\r\nthe crime.\" Id. at 880.\r\n2 According to the Fourth Circuit, the United States Supreme Court in Opper\r\nrejected the corpus delicti rule and adopted the \"trustworthiness approach.\" See\r\nUnited States v. Abu Ali, 528 F.3d 210, 235 (4th Cir. 2008) (noting the Supreme\r\nCourt in Opper \"reject[ed] the corpus delicti rule and adopt[ed] the trustworthiness\r\napproach, which it found to be the 'better rule.'\" (citing Opper, 348 U.S. at 93)).\r\nAs our supreme court in Osborne clarified this state's law to be consistent with the\r\nrule outlined in Opper, we speculate that continued reference to the requirement\r\nthat a defendant's extra-judicial statements must be corroborated by \"proof aliunde\r\nof the corpus delicti\" has caused confusion amongst the bench and bar. We\r\nanticipate that this confusion could be avoided by ceasing reference to \"proof\r\naliunde of the corpus delicti\" and similar terms, and instead echoing the language\r\nin Opper, in that the State must \"introduce substantial independent evidence which\r\nwould tend to establish the trustworthiness of the statement.\" Opper, 348 U.S. at\r\n93.\r\n3The code provision in effect at the time Abraham committed the offense in 2011\r\nhas not since been amended; thus, we cite to the current version of section 56-5-\r\n2930.\r\n\n            smelled like alcohol, failed field sobriety tests, and\r\n            appeared to be intoxicated. A breathalyzer test showed\r\n            his blood alcohol level to be .21. This is enough\r\n            evidence, albeit circumstantial evidence, to submit the\r\n            case to the jury. Accordingly, the circuit court judge\r\n            erred in reversing Townsend's conviction on this ground.\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted). All of the above-listed facts of Townsend are\r\npresent in this case. Abraham was found at the accident scene of a wrecked\r\nvehicle in the presence of emergency personnel. He smelled of alcohol, failed field\r\nsobriety tests, and appeared to be intoxicated. A breathalyzer test showed his\r\nblood alcohol level to be .22 percent. Trooper Brown noted the wrecked vehicle\r\nhad \"front-end damage consistent with running into a tree.\" Additionally, the\r\nwrecked vehicle was located in Keowee Key, Abraham's stated destination, on a\r\nroad that passes by the local country club, where Abraham claimed to have\r\npreviously been. Abraham also admitted to driving the wrecked vehicle. The State\r\nprovided sufficient independent evidence to support the trustworthiness of\r\nAbraham's statements to the police. Furthermore, this independent evidence, taken\r\ntogether with the statements, allowed a reasonable inference that the crime of DUI\r\nwas committed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hold the magistrate court properly denied Abraham's motion for a\r\ndirected verdict and submitted the case to the jury. See Osborne, 335 S.C. at 180,\r\n516 S.E.2d at 205 (finding a DUI case was properly submitted to a jury when the\r\nState presented sufficient independent evidence supporting the trustworthiness of\r\nthe defendant's statements and that evidence, taken together with the defendant's\r\nstatements, allowed a reasonable inference that the crime of DUI was committed);\r\nsee also State v. White, 311 S.C. 289, 296-97, 428 S.E.2d 740, 744 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n(holding that precise questions of whether the defendant drove the vehicle in\r\nquestion under the influence of alcohol or drugs were properly left to the jury as\r\nfactfinders). Accordingly, the circuit court erred as a matter of law in reversing\r\nAbraham's conviction. The decision of the circuit court is hereby reversed and\r\nAbraham's conviction is reinstated.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5239","title":"Shatto v.

McLeod Regional Medical Center, 406 S.C. 470, 753\r\nS.E.2d 416 (2013), with instructions to address whether Mildred Shatto's fall while\r\nin the operating room at McLeod Regional Hospital (McLeod) was idiopathic in\r\nnature. After a review of the record, we affirm the order of the Appellate Panel of\r\nthe Workers' Compensation Commission (the Appellate Panel) and find Shatto\r\nsuffered a compensable, work-related injury.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facts surrounding Shatto's employment with McLeod are largely set forth in\r\nShatto v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, 394 S.C. 552, 716 S.E.2d 446 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011). Shatto secured employment at McLeod after procuring the services of\r\nStaff Care, Inc. (Staff Care), a temporary medical service staffing company. Staff\r\nCare placed Shatto with McLeod as a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA)\r\nto provide temporary medical services as a CRNA from November 2007 until\r\nFebruary 2008. On December 21, 2007, Shatto fell on the operating room floor\r\nwhile assisting in the anesthetization of a patient. Shatto was treated in McLeod's\r\nemergency room and diagnosed with a contusion to the right eye. At the end of\r\nDecember 2007, Shatto's assignment with McLeod was terminated.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 2008, Shatto filed a Form 50 against McLeod and Staff Care. After a\r\nhearing, the single commissioner concluded Shatto was an employee of McLeod\r\nand sustained an injury by accident in the course of her employment. McLeod\r\nappealed the single commissioner's decision, and the Appellate Panel affirmed the\r\nsingle commissioner. In McLeod's initial appeal to this court, it presented the\r\nfollowing two questions: (1) whether Shatto was an employee of McLeod; and (2)\r\nwhether Shatto's fall was compensable and not idiopathic in nature. After\r\nconcluding Shatto was not an employee, this court declined to address McLeod's\r\nremaining contention regarding the compensability of her fall. Shatto, 394 S.C. at\r\n567, 716 S.E.2d at 454. Shatto then appealed to our supreme court, which\r\n\nconcluded \"the evidence, although not one-sided, preponderate[d] in favor of an\r\nemployment relationship.\" Shatto, 406 S.C. at 472, 753 S.E.2d at 417. Our\r\nsupreme court then instructed this court to address McLeod's additional assignment\r\nof error initially presented to, but not reached by, this court.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in workers' compensation cases and\r\nis not bound by the single commissioner's findings of fact. Etheredge v. Monsanto\r\nCo., 349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002). The findings of the\r\nAppellate Panel are presumed correct and will only be set aside if unsupported by\r\nsubstantial evidence. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n(1981). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence\r\nviewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the\r\nrecord as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\nadministrative agency reached in order to justify its action.\" Taylor v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nMotor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 36, 627 S.E.2d 751, 752 (Ct. App. 2006) (internal\r\ncitation omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMcLeod contends Shatto's fall was not compensable because it was idiopathic in\r\nnature. We disagree.\r\n\r\nTo be compensable, an injury by accident must be one \"arising out of and in the\r\ncourse of employment.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\n             The two parts of the phrase \"arising out of and in the\r\n             course of employment\" are not synonymous. Also, both\r\n             parts must exist simultaneously before a court will allow\r\n             recovery. \"Arising out of\" refers to the injury's origin\r\n             and cause, whereas \"in the course of\" refers to the\r\n             injury's time, place, and circumstances. For an injury to\r\n             \"arise out of\" employment, the injury must be\r\n             proximately caused by the employment. An injury arises\r\n             out of employment when there is a causal connection\r\n             between the conditions under which the work is required\r\n             to be performed and the resulting injury. An injury\r\n             occurs \"in the course of\" employment when it happens\r\n\n             within the period of employment at a place where the\r\n             employee reasonably may be in the performance of the\r\n             employee's duties and while fulfilling those duties or\r\n             engaging in something incidental to those duties.\r\n\r\nArdis v. Combined Ins. Co., 380 S.C. 313, 320-21, 669 S.E.2d 628, 632 (Ct. App.\r\n2008) (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nWhen an employee has an idiopathic fall while standing on a level surface, and in\r\nthe course of the fall, hits no machinery, furniture, or other objects that would\r\notherwise contribute to the effect of the fall, the majority of jurisdictions deny\r\ncompensation. Crosby v. Wal-Mart Store, Inc., 330 S.C. 489, 493, 499 S.E.2d 253,\r\n256 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing 1 Arthur Larson & Lex K. Larson, Workers'\r\nCompensation Law § 12.14(a) (1997)). \"The reasoning behind this viewpoint is\r\nthat the basic cause of the harm is personal, and the employment does not\r\nsignificantly add to the risk.\" Id. As a result, an injury resulting from an\r\nidiopathic or unexplained fall is generally not compensable unless the employment\r\ncontributed to either the cause or the effect of the fall. Bagwell v. Ernest Burwell,\r\nInc., 227 S.C. 444, 452-53, 88 S.E.2d 611, 614-15 (1955). To be compensable, the\r\ninjury is not required to be foreseen or expected, but after the event, it must appear\r\nto have originated in a risk connected with the employment and to have come from\r\nthat source as a rational consequence. Ardis, 380 S.C. at 321, 669 S.E.2d at 632.\r\n\r\nWe find there is substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panel's decision that\r\nShatto's injury was not a result of an idiopathic fall. In support of its conclusion,\r\nthe Appellate Panel noted Shatto was preparing to \"anesthetize a patient and was\r\nwalking around the patient's bed when her foot became caught on something and\r\nshe fell.\" Moreover, the Appellate Panel further stated, \"[a]lthough [Shatto] does\r\nnot know the exact item she tripped over, her shoe was still at the head of the bed\r\nwhen [Shatto] tried to stand up after her fall.\"\r\n\r\nShatto's testimony before the single commissioner supports the Appellate Panel's\r\nconclusion as well. Specifically, Shatto testified as follows:\r\n\r\n             [McLeod]: Tell me exactly --- you say you were walking\r\n             around to the side of the bed. Do you know exactly what\r\n             you fell on? How would you describe what happened to\r\n             you?\r\n\n             [Shatto]: The patient's bed was an electric one, so it had\r\n             an electrical cord to connect it. There was an I.V. pole\r\n             with the patient, and it had a pump on it, so that had a\r\n             cord to be plugged in, and there was an extra I.V. pole on\r\n             it at the head of the bed towards the left side of the bed. I\r\n             don't know for sure what my foot caught on, but it was\r\n             one of those three things: the I.V. pole or cords from the\r\n             bed or the pump.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the Appellate Panel properly found Shatto's injury\r\nwas compensable. Although Shatto did not directly and unequivocally testify to\r\nwhat specifically caused her to fall, there is ample circumstantial evidence in the\r\nrecord that Shatto's fall was the result of conditions of her employment. See Tiller\r\nv. Nat'l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 341, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846-47\r\n(1999) (holding proof that workers' compensation claimant sustained an injury may\r\nbe established by circumstantial and direct evidence); Taylor, 368 S.C. at 36, 627\r\nS.E.2d at 752 (stating evidence is substantial if, considering the record as a whole,\r\nit \"would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency\r\nreached in order to justify its action\" (quoting S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v.\r\nNelson, 364 S.C. 514, 519, 613 S.E.2d 54, 547 (2005)); Rogers v. Kunja Knitting\r\nMills, Inc., 312 S.C. 377, 381, 440 S.E.2d 401, 403 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding the\r\ncircuit court's reversal of the Appellate Panel was error because although the\r\nevidence conflicted, the Appellate Panel's findings were supported by substantial\r\nevidence). Shatto had an explanation for her fall, and although she was not\r\nabsolutely certain as to what caused her fall, she identified specific, non-internal\r\nreasons for tripping. Cf. Crosby, 330 S.C. at 495, 499 S.E.2d at 256 (finding\r\nclaimant failed to present any evidence as to what caused her to fall and\r\nconcluding it would be wholly conjectural to conclude her employment was a\r\ncontributing cause of her injury). Because Shatto presented satisfactory evidence\r\nthat \"the origin of the risk was connected with [her] employment,\" we hold her\r\ninjury flowed as a natural consequence of her work at the hospital and thus arose\r\nout of and in the course of her employment with McLeod. See Douglas v. Spartan\r\nMills, Startex Div., 245 S.C. 265, 269, 140 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1965) (\"[The\r\ncausative danger] need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it\r\nmust appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to\r\nhave flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\" (internal quotation marks\r\nand citation omitted)).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold Shatto sustained a compensable, work-related\r\ninjury, and she was entitled to workers' compensation benefits for her injuries.\r\nAccordingly, the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5240","title":"State v.

Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of February 13, 2010, Kenneth Mack was severely beaten during\r\nthe course of two fights. The first fight occurred on McDuffie Street near\r\nGonzales Gardens—a public housing complex in Columbia consisting of thirty\r\napartment buildings. The second fight occurred moments later between two\r\nbuildings in Gonzales Gardens. Mack died several days later from injuries he\r\nreceived during the fights.\r\n\r\nMultiple eyewitnesses testified to the details of the two fights. According to their\r\naccounts, Gray and his co-defendant Robin Reese, who is also his sister, were\r\ninvolved only in the second fight. They were both charged with murder and first-\r\ndegree lynching. The following testimony was presented at their joint trial.\r\n\r\n             A.    Testimony Regarding the First Fight\r\n\r\nIssac Weathers, who lived in Gonzales Gardens, testified the first fight began when\r\nMack and a \"young lady,\" later identified as Reese's thirteen-year-old daughter and\r\nGray's niece, started \"arguing . . . and they fell\" to the ground. Weathers testified\r\nthat after they fell, \"a bunch of guys went and jumped on [Mack]\" and began\r\nattacking him.\r\n\r\nAmber Hardy testified she called 911 when she witnessed four men and a girl\r\n\"beating up [Mack].\" She described the fight as \"brutal\" and claimed the group\r\n\r\n1 Gray also appeals the trial court's refusal to charge involuntary manslaughter.\r\nGray's trial counsel asserted no argument in support of an involuntary\r\nmanslaughter charge but simply told the court, \"I made some . . . requests for\r\ncharges, if you would please deny those on the record, I would appreciate it.\" We\r\ndecline to address this issue because we find it is not preserved for our review. See\r\nState v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (\"[F]or an issue to\r\nbe preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\nthe trial judge.\"); Gilchrist v. State, 364 S.C. 173, 178, 612 S.E.2d 702, 705 (2005)\r\n(finding \"trial counsel's submission of the request to charge, without any further\r\nexplanation of his point, was insufficient to preserve [his argument] for review\"\r\nbecause \"[w]hen given the opportunity, counsel must articulate a reason for the\r\nrequested charge\").\r\n\nmembers \"took turns\" kicking and punching Mack. Hardy testified that after the\r\nfight ended, Mack stood up and walked away, but was unsteady on his feet and\r\nkept \"reaching out to . . . brace himself.\"\r\n\r\nTwo men involved in the first fight—Marcellius Brooks, who lived in Gonzales\r\nGardens, and Angelo Boyd, who lived in a house next to Gonzales Gardens—\r\ntestified they were walking down McDuffie Street when they saw Reese's daughter\r\narguing with Mack. Brooks claimed that when Mack \"pick[ed her] up and\r\nslam[med] her to the ground,\" Brooks \"tackled [Mack] off her.\" Brooks admitted\r\nhitting Mack twice with a \"closed fist,\" but denied kicking him and stated no one\r\nelse was involved in the fight. Boyd admitted kicking Mack once, and stated\r\nReese's daughter hit him \"a couple times,\" but similarly denied that anyone else\r\nwas involved. Both testified that after the fight, Mack got up and ran toward\r\nGonzales Gardens.\r\n\r\n                B.     Testimony Regarding the Second Fight\r\n\r\nReese, who lived in Gonzales Gardens, testified she learned about the assault on\r\nher daughter shortly after it occurred and became upset. Although Reese initially\r\ndenied calling Gray, she later admitted she called Gray and told him \"some grown\r\nman [was on] my daughter.\" She then decided to search for the man who attacked\r\nher daughter. According to Reese, she discovered Mack lying on the ground in\r\nfront of her father's apartment building in Gonzales Gardens. Reese testified she\r\n\"tried to kick [Mack] but [she] slipped and fell.\" She then \"reached over and\r\nslapped him across his face and told him 'you stay away from my kid.'\" At that\r\npoint, Gray arrived and pulled her off Mack and told her \"let the police handle it.\"\r\nShe testified she was still angry, so she grabbed a chair, which other witnesses\r\ndescribed as a \"metal lawn chair,\" and \"slung it\" at Mack, although \"[i]t didn't even\r\ncome in contact with his body.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral eyewitnesses described the second fight much differently.2 Donnetti Perry,\r\nwho lived in Gonzales Gardens, testified he saw Gray and Mack talking in front of\r\nthe building where Gray and Reese's father lived. According to Perry, Gray\r\nreceived a phone call during this conversation, and when he hung up, Gray \"swept\r\n[Mack's] feet out from under him,\" causing him to fall and hit his head on the\r\nground. He claimed Gray kicked Mack \"all over\" and yelled, \"[W]hat [did] you do\r\nto my niece?\" He testified Reese arrived at that point and said to Gray, \"[T]hat's\r\nhim,\" and started kicking Mack and yelling, \"I'm going to teach you for messing\r\n\r\n2   Gray did not testify at trial.\r\n\nwith my daughter.\" He claimed Reese then \"got [the] chair and hit him\" two or\r\nthree times, and Gray also hit Mack with the chair a couple of times. Perry\r\ntestified Mack remained on the ground throughout the fight and did not \"resist\" or\r\notherwise defend himself.\r\n\r\nKara Chase, who was staying with a friend in Gonzales Gardens, gave a statement\r\nto police shortly after the second fight. In this statement, which was introduced\r\ninto evidence, she claimed Gray \"swept [Mack] from under his feet causing [him]\r\nto hit his head on the pavement.\" Afterward, Reese \"[ran] up the street saying\r\n'that's him'\" and \"kick[ed] [Mack] repeatedly, picking up an old metal chair and\r\nthrowing it on top of [him].\" Gray \"continued to kick and stomp [Mack] in his\r\nface,\" and Mack \"laid on the ground the whole time this was occurring.\" At trial,\r\nhowever, Chase testified to a different version of events. She denied Gray kicked\r\nMack's legs out from under him, or that Reese hit Mack with the metal chair. She\r\nalso claimed Mack got up during the fight and did not remain on the ground the\r\nentire time. C.    Medical Testimony\r\n\r\nThe State called Dr. Bradley Marcus, the pathologist who performed Mack's\r\nautopsy, as an expert witness. During Dr. Marcus's testimony, the State offered\r\ninto evidence eleven photographs taken before and during the autopsy. Both Gray\r\nand Reese objected to the admission of the photos under Rule 403, SCRE, arguing\r\nthe danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed their probative value.\r\nAfter a hearing outside of the jury's presence, the trial court admitted the photos.\r\n\r\nDr. Marcus continued his testimony and relied on the photos to describe Mack's\r\ninjuries to the jury. He testified \"the cause of death was a closed head injury due to\r\nblunt head trauma.\" He explained that during the autopsy, he discovered Mack\r\nsuffered a skull fracture to the back right side of his head and had \"a massive\r\namount of subdural hemorrhage\" where the skull fracture was located. He testified\r\nthis was \"a significant injury\" and the \"ultimate cause of death.\" Although he\r\ncould not determine if the fatal injury occurred during the first or second fight, Dr.\r\nMarcus testified the brain injury was consistent with someone \"having their feet\r\nswept out from under them and landing on their head.\"\r\n\r\nGray and Reese each called forensic pathologists to testify regarding Mack's death.\r\nBoth pathologists agreed with Dr. Marcus's testimony that blunt force trauma\r\ncaused Mack's death. However, Gray's pathologist, Dr. Adel Shaker, commented\r\non the thoroughness of the autopsy, stating it \"was a hospital autopsy, not a\r\n\nforensic one,\" and explained \"there is a great difference\" between the two in regard\r\nto the level of detail. While Dr. Shaker did not know whether the first or second\r\nfight caused Mack's skull fracture, he stated, \"[A]ll of the attacks that [Mack]\r\nexperienced earlier . . . [left] an impact\" and ultimately caused \"the final result\"—\r\ndeath. Dr. Shaker further testified a person could receive fatal head injuries and\r\nexperience a \"lucid interval,\" during which the person may \"be unsteady on [his]\r\nfeet\" but can otherwise \"walk, talk, [and] do regular activities for a few minutes\"\r\nbefore succumbing to his injuries. He testified Mack could have suffered a fatal\r\nbrain injury during the first fight and experienced a lucid interval at the time of the\r\nsecond fight, which caused him to \"los[e] his balance, and hit his head.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply, the State called Dr. Clay Nichols, the chief medical examiner for\r\nRichland County at the time of Mack's death, to refute Dr. Shaker's testimony\r\ncasting doubt upon the reliability of the autopsy. Dr. Nichols also testified he\r\nbelieved Mack's skull fracture occurred during the second fight when \"[Mack] fell\r\nand hit the concrete.\"\r\n\r\n             D.     Verdicts and Sentencing\r\n\r\nThe jury found Gray and Reese guilty of murder and first-degree lynching.3 The\r\ntrial court sentenced them to thirty years in prison for each conviction, with the\r\nsentences to run concurrent.\r\n\r\n      II.    Admission of Autopsy Photos\r\n\r\nGray contends the trial court erred in admitting the autopsy photos. He argues the\r\ncourt should have excluded them under Rule 403, SCRE because their probative\r\nvalue was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Rule\r\n403, SCRE (stating relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\").\r\n\r\n             A.     Standard of Review\r\n\r\n\"The admission of evidence is within the circuit court's discretion and will not be\r\nreversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\" State v. Dickerson, 395\r\n\r\n3 The former crime of lynching was defined in section 16-3-210 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2003). The section was amended effective June 2, 2010 and\r\nredefined first-degree lynching as \"assault and battery by mob in the first degree.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-210(B) (Supp. 2013).\r\n\nS.C. 101, 116, 716 S.E.2d 895, 903 (2011). \"A trial court has particularly wide\r\ndiscretion in ruling on Rule 403 objections.\" State v. Lee, 399 S.C. 521, 527, 732\r\nS.E.2d 225, 228 (Ct. App. 2012); see also State v. Dial, 405 S.C. 247, 260, 746\r\nS.E.2d 495, 502 (Ct. App. 2013) (\"A trial judge's decision regarding the\r\ncomparative probative value and prejudicial effect of relevant evidence should be\r\nreversed only in exceptional circumstances.\" (citation omitted)); State v. Adams,\r\n354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"We . . . are obligated to\r\ngive great deference to the trial court's judgment [regarding Rule 403].\" (internal\r\ncitation omitted)). In exercising its discretion on a Rule 403 objection to the\r\nadmissibility of autopsy photographs, the trial court \"must balance the [unfair\r\nprejudice] of graphic photos against their probative value.\" Dial, 405 S.C. at 260,\r\n746 S.E.2d at 502 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n             B.     Description of the Photos\r\n\r\nThere are eleven autopsy photos at issue in this appeal. Eight of these—Exhibits\r\n51 through 57 and 82—were taken before the autopsy began and show Mack's\r\nexternal injuries to his face, back, and legs. It was important for the jury to see the\r\nnature and location of these injuries in order to understand the witnesses' testimony\r\nabout the fights and the pathologists' testimony about the injuries. These eight\r\nphotographs contain no blood or gory anatomical details, and thus pose little, if\r\nany, danger of unfair prejudice. Because Exhibits 51 through 57 and 82 had high\r\nprobative value and minimal danger of unfair prejudice, it was clearly within the\r\ntrial court's discretion to admit them.\r\n\r\nThe other three photos—Exhibit 80, 81, and 83—were taken during the autopsy\r\nand show Mack's exposed skull and brain. Exhibit 81 is a side view of Mack's\r\nhead that shows his inside-out scalp pulled down over his face. At first glance, it\r\nappears Mack is wearing a mask over his face. In explaining what the viewer sees\r\nin Exhibit 81, Dr. Marcus testified:\r\n\r\n             The way we do the head is . . . we make an incision along\r\n             the back of the scalp here. . . . We pull the scalp over this\r\n             way. You just literally just pull it over [the face] and\r\n             that's what you're actually seeing here.\r\n\r\nExhibit 83 is a side view of Mack's exposed brain protruding from his open skull\r\nafter the top part of his skull—referred to as the \"skull cap\"—was cut off. A\r\ngloved hand is holding the sawed-off skull cap, which is filled with blood on one\r\nside. Exhibit 80 is a close-up image of the hand holding Mack's skull cap, showing\r\n\nthe details of the inside of his skull. The remainder of our discussion focuses on\r\nwhether the trial court acted within its discretion to admit these three photos.\r\n\r\n             C.    Probative Value\r\n\r\nRule 403 provides that, \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"\r\n\"Probative\" means \"[t]ending to prove or disprove.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1323\r\n(9th ed. 2009). \"Probative value\" is the measure of the importance of that tendency\r\nto the outcome of a case. It is the weight that a piece of relevant evidence will\r\ncarry in helping the trier of fact decide the issues. \"[T]he more essential the\r\nevidence, the greater its probative value.\" United States v. Stout, 509 F.3d 796,\r\n804 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a court analyzing\r\nprobative value considers the importance of the evidence and the significance of\r\nthe issues to which the evidence relates. As our supreme court stated in State v.\r\nTorres, 390 S.C. 618, 703 S.E.2d 226 (2010), \"[p]hotographs calculated to arouse\r\nthe sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are . . . not\r\nnecessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.\" 390 S.C. at 623, 703\r\nS.E.2d at 228 (emphasis added). The evaluation of probative value cannot be\r\nmade in the abstract, but should be made in the practical context of the issues at\r\nstake in the trial of each case. See State v. Lyles, 379 S.C. 328, 338, 665 S.E.2d\r\n201, 206 (Ct. App. 2008) (\"When [balancing the danger of unfair prejudice]\r\nagainst the probative value, the determination must be based on the entire record\r\nand will turn on the facts of each case.\" (citing State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 609,\r\n646 S.E.2d 872, 876 (2007))).\r\n\r\nSo that we may analyze the probative value of these three photos in the practical\r\ncontext of the issues at stake in this trial, we summarize Dr. Marcus's testimony\r\nand the evidence upon which he relied to explain his opinions to the jury.\r\n\r\nBefore the State introduced the autopsy photos, Dr. Marcus relied on two diagrams\r\nhe made during the autopsy. These diagrams, which Dr. Marcus characterized as\r\n\"crude,\" consist of hand-drawn depictions of a human form with markings to\r\nidentify the location of Mack's external and internal injuries. Dr. Marcus testified\r\nthe diagrams would \"assist [him] in explaining [his findings] to the jury.\"\r\n\r\nThe State then offered the autopsy photos, which Dr. Marcus described as \"crucial\"\r\nand \"necessary\" for helping the jury understand his testimony. Dr. Marcus testified\r\nExhibits 51 through 57 illustrated Mack's external injuries and were \"helpful in\r\ndetermining the cause of death in this case.\" He described the injuries depicted in\r\n\neach photo and stated they were \"consistent with blunt force trauma to the head.\"\r\nAs for Exhibits 80, 81, and 83, Dr. Marcus explained these photos were taken\r\nduring the autopsy and \"depict the cause of death\" in a manner that he could not\r\ndiagram. He testified the photos \"actually illustrate what happened to this man's\r\nbrain\" and \"would . . . aid [him] in describing the injuries to the jury.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Marcus then explained each step of the autopsy and his associated findings.\r\nHe told the jury he first examined Mack's skull by removing the scalp, at which\r\npoint he discovered Mack suffered a skull fracture to the back right side of the\r\nhead. He stated it would take a \"[s]ignificant amount of force\" to cause this skull\r\nfracture, and it was consistent with someone \"having their feet swept out from\r\nunder them and landing on their head.\" He then explained the next step in the\r\nautopsy process—removing the skull cap to observe the brain—and discussed his\r\nfindings. Dr. Marcus testified that when he removed Mack's skull cap, he found \"a\r\nsignificant injury\" that was \"the ultimate cause of death.\" He explained there was\r\n\"a massive amount of subdural hemorrhage\" and \"cerebral contusions\" where the\r\nskull fracture was located. He testified cerebral contusions indicate a significant\r\namount of trauma and often occur in high-impact car collisions.\r\n\r\nAt this point in his testimony, Dr. Marcus began describing Exhibits 80, 81, and 83\r\nand explaining what each photo depicted. Starting with Exhibit 81, he testified this\r\nphoto showed Mack's skull with the scalp removed, and allowed the jury to see\r\n\"some of the hemorrhage area\" caused by the blunt force trauma. The bloody\r\nhemorrhage area shown in Exhibit 81 clearly demonstrates the location of the skull\r\nfracture Dr. Marcus was attempting to explain. He stated, \"That area should be\r\nclean with no hemorrhage or anything.\" Although he did not specifically identify\r\nExhibits 80 and 83 on the record, it is apparent from the context of his testimony\r\nand the content of the photos that he was showing the jury these two exhibits to\r\nexplain his findings:\r\n\r\n            A. \t   The next part we do is actually removing the skull\r\n                   cap itself and that's showing all the hemorrhage in\r\n                   the brain that should not be there, having the brain\r\n                   hemorrhage like that is incompatible to life.\r\n\r\n            Q. \t   And in order for the brain itself to suffer this kind\r\n                   of hemorrhage, is that more significant than ---\r\n\r\n            A. \t   Yes, yes. You can live with trauma on the scalp.\r\n                   You cannot live with that hemorrhage on the brain.\r\n\n                   That's incompatible with life. That is just a close-\r\n                   up showing that [the hemorrhage has] been there --\r\n                   it's probably been there about three days.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Following this testimony, the photos were handed to the jury.\r\nDr. Marcus continued his testimony, stating \"the cause of death was a closed head\r\ninjury due to blunt head trauma.\" Although he could not determine if the fatal\r\ninjury occurred during the first or second fight, Dr. Marcus testified the cerebral\r\ncontusions were \"consistent with someone falling\" onto a hard surface.\r\n\r\nDr. Marcus's testimony as summarized above increased the probative value of the\r\nphotos because his use of the photos to explain Mack's injuries demonstrated \"the\r\nextent and nature of the injuries in a way that would not be as easily understood\r\nbased on [expert] testimony alone.\" State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 290, 676 S.E.2d\r\n690, 697 (2009). The medical testimony related to Mack's brain injuries and the\r\nseverity of these injuries, which we do not consider to be a matter readily\r\nunderstood by most jurors, who are typically \"unversed in medical matters.\" 382\r\nS.C. at 291, 676 S.E.2d at 697. We also rely on Dr. Marcus's own testimony that\r\nthe photos would help him explain to the jury the medical significance of Mack's\r\ninjuries. See 382 S.C. at 290-91, 676 S.E.2d at 697 (relying on pathologist's\r\ntestimony that autopsy photos would help him demonstrate certain \"anatomic\r\nrelationships\" that could not otherwise be explained to the jury); Dial, 405 S.C. at\r\n261, 746 S.E.2d at 502 (finding no abuse of discretion to admit autopsy photos\r\nwhen the expert \"testified the photographs would aid in her testimony\").\r\n\r\nThe State argues the photos had probative value because they corroborated Dr.\r\nMarcus's findings concerning the extent and location of Mack's head injuries, as\r\nwell as the cause of death. We agree. See Dial, 405 S.C. at 260-61, 746 S.E.2d at\r\n502 (finding autopsy photos \"were highly probative\" to the issue of cause of death\r\nbecause they corroborated expert testimony that victim's injuries were\r\n\"inconsistent with an accidental injury\"); State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 106-07, 564\r\nS.E.2d 362, 371 (Ct. App. 2002) (affirming admission of autopsy photos that\r\n\"corroborated . . . the pathologist's testimony regarding the extent of th[e]\r\ninjuries\"). When a photo derives probative value from its tendency to corroborate\r\ntestimony, the measure of this value varies depending on the facts of each\r\nindividual case. Photos that corroborate important testimony on issues significant\r\nto the case may have very high probative value, while photos that corroborate only\r\ntestimony related to collateral issues will have less probative value. Therefore, we\r\ndiscuss the two reasons this corroborative effect was important on the facts of this\r\ncase.\r\n\nFirst, Gray and Reese each retained their own pathologist to testify at trial. The\r\nState knew before trial that Gray and Reese intended to call pathologists to testify,\r\nand it must have known the general nature of the testimony they would give.\r\nHowever, the State did not know the substance of their opinions, nor the effect\r\ntheir testimony would have on the credibility of its own pathologist's testimony.\r\nThis uncertainty affects our analysis of probative value because it made it more\r\nimportant for the State to present evidence to corroborate Dr. Marcus's testimony.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Gray conceded at oral argument, the State reasonably anticipated\r\nGray's pathologist would testify Mack died as a result of injuries he received in the\r\nfirst fight. In fact, while Dr. Shaker testified he could not conclude whether\r\nMack's death resulted from the first or second fight, he clearly suggested the\r\ninjuries from the first fight would have been fatal. To explain how Mack was able\r\nto walk around after these fatal injuries, and even have a conversation with Gray,\r\nDr. Shaker put forth a theory that Mack may have experienced a \"lucid interval\" at\r\nthe time of the second fight. However, because the lucid interval was only\r\ntemporary, Mack would have succumbed to his injuries regardless of Gray's\r\nconduct. From such evidence, Gray could argue his actions did not cause Mack's\r\ndeath. See State v. Jenkins, 276 S.C. 209, 211, 277 S.E.2d 147, 148 (1981) (stating\r\n\"one who inflicts an injury on another is deemed by law to be guilty of [murder]\r\nwhere the injury contributes . . . to the death of the other\" (emphasis added)).\r\nThus, the corroborative effect of the photos served to rebut testimony the State\r\nreasonably anticipated Gray's pathologist would offer.\r\n\r\nThe second reason the corroborative effect of these photos was important is that it\r\naided the State in proving the fatal brain injury occurred during the second fight.\r\nPerry testified Gray \"swept [Mack's] feet out from under him,\" which caused Mack\r\nto hit his head on the ground. The autopsy photos and Dr. Marcus's testimony link\r\nthis act—Gray causing Mack to fall—with the fatal brain injury in two ways.\r\nFirst, the photos show extensive cranial bleeding on the back of Mack's head, and\r\nDr. Marcus testified this fatal injury was \"consistent with someone falling\" onto a\r\nhard surface. Second, there was no testimony regarding the first fight that\r\nspecifically mentioned any blow to the back of Mack's head. Thus, to prove Mack\r\ndied as a result of Gray's actions during the second fight, it was important for the\r\nState to show the jury the significance and exact location of the injury that caused\r\nMack's death.\r\n\r\nThe State also argues the photos were important to prove malice. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-3-10 (2003) (defining \"murder\" as \"the killing of any person with malice\r\n\naforethought, either express or implied\" (emphasis added)). According to the\r\ntestimony of the pathologists, a significant amount of force was necessary to cause\r\nMack's injuries. The photos show Mack had a massive amount of cranial bleeding\r\nin the back part of his brain, which demonstrated the severity of the force needed\r\nto inflict this injury. Thus, the photos were important to the State's ability to\r\nestablish that Gray and Reese acted with malice. See State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501,\r\n508, 466 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1996) (finding photos of the victim's stab wounds were\r\n\"relevant to the issue of malice, an element of assault and battery with intent to\r\nkill\"); State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 178, 460 S.E.2d 368, 371 (1995) (finding\r\nphotos of the crime scene \"depicted the excess nature of the killing\" and were\r\nprobative to \"the issue of malice\");4 State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 250, 669\r\nS.E.2d 598, 608 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating the autopsy photos were relevant to prove\r\n\"the [child] abuse manifested an extreme indifference to human life\"—the required\r\nmental state for homicide by child abuse).\r\n\r\nGray argues, however, that any probative value of the photos was minimal because\r\ncause of death was not disputed. Gray explains that neither his nor Reese's\r\npathologist contested the cause of death to which Dr. Marcus testified. We find the\r\nargument unpersuasive. Neither the State nor the trial court knew at the time the\r\nphotos were offered and admitted into evidence that the defense pathologists would\r\nagree with Dr. Marcus as to the cause of death. In fact, Gray concedes the State—\r\nand presumably the trial court—reasonably anticipated that the defense\r\npathologists were called for the purpose of disputing Dr. Marcus's testimony,\r\nwhich focused primarily on cause of death. The record supports Gray's\r\nconcession. When Gray objected to the introduction of the photos, the State\r\nargued they were necessary because \"cause of death is an issue in this case\" and\r\nGray and Reese \"have hired two . . . pathologists to dispute the [autopsy] findings.\"\r\nGray and Reese did not respond, leaving the trial court with the clear impression\r\nthe State's argument was correct. Therefore, at the time the trial court analyzed\r\nprobative value, the court was unaware of the primary circumstance Gray relies\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Kelley and Nance were tried before the Rules of Evidence were effective, and\r\nthus Rule 403, SCRE, did not apply. See Rule 1103(b), SCRE (\"These rules shall\r\nbecome effective September 3, 1995.\"). However, both cases were tried after State\r\nv. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991), in which our supreme court\r\n\"adopt[ed] the language . . . of Federal Rule of Evidence 403 that, 'although\r\nrelevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.'\" 303 S.C. at 382, 401 S.E.2d at\r\n149.\r\n\nupon for his argument that the photos lacked probative value—that the defense\r\npathologists agreed with the State as to cause of death.\r\n\r\nGray also asserts the photos were unnecessary for the jury to understand Dr.\r\nMarcus's testimony because, prior to their introduction, Dr. Marcus relied on\r\ndiagrams to explain Mack's injuries and the cause of death to the jury. Given the\r\nuse of these diagrams, Gray argues the probative value of the photos was minimal.\r\nWe find Dr. Marcus's use of the photos served a different purpose and corroborated\r\ndifferent findings than the diagrams. Dr. Marcus described the diagrams as\r\n\"crude\" drawings, and our examination of them convinces us they demonstrated to\r\nthe jury only the general location of the injuries. In fact, Dr. Marcus stated, \"I can't\r\ndiagram this,\" in referencing why the photos were necessary to his testimony. The\r\nphotos demonstrated what the diagrams could not: the significance of the head\r\ninjury and the specific location of the primary injury—the skull fracture. Thus, we\r\nfind the admission of the photos was necessary in combination with the diagrams\r\n\"to substantiate material facts\" regarding the extent of the injuries that caused\r\nMack's death. Dial, 405 S.C. at 260, 746 S.E.2d at 502.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we find the probative value of Exhibits 80, 81, and 83 was high.\r\n\r\n             D.     Unfair Prejudice\r\n\r\nThe probative value of the photos must be balanced against \"the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice.\" Prejudice that is \"unfair\" is distinguished from the legitimate impact all\r\nevidence has on the outcome of a case. \"'Unfair prejudice does not mean the\r\ndamage to a defendant's case that results from the legitimate probative force of the\r\nevidence; rather it refers to evidence which tends to suggest decision on an\r\nimproper basis.'\" State v. Gilchrist, 329 S.C. 621, 630, 496 S.E.2d 424, 429 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998) (quoting United States v. Bonds, 12 F.3d 540, 567 (6th Cir. 1993)).\r\n\"'All evidence is meant to be prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice which must be\r\n[scrutinized under Rule 403].'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Rodriguez–Estrada,\r\n877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir. 1989)); see also United States v. Mohr, 318 F.3d 613,\r\n619-20 (4th Cir. 2003) (\"Rule 403 only requires suppression of evidence that\r\nresults in unfair prejudice—prejudice that damages an opponent for reasons other\r\nthan its probative value, for instance, an appeal to emotion . . . .\").\r\n\r\nPhotos pose a danger of unfair prejudice when they have \"an undue tendency to\r\nsuggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an\r\nemotional one.\" Holder, 382 S.C. at 290, 676 S.E.2d at 697 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). This definition of unfair prejudice was taken originally from the\r\n\nAdvisory Committee Notes to the formerly identical federal rule 403.5 See State v.\r\nAlexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991) (adopting the definition\r\nof unfair prejudice recited in the Notes of the Federal Rules Advisory Committee).\r\nRegarding this definition, the Supreme Court of the United States stated: \"The term\r\n'unfair prejudice,' as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some\r\nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground\r\ndifferent from proof specific to the offense charged.\" Old Chief v. United States,\r\n519 U.S. 172, 180, 117 S. Ct. 644, 650, 136 L. Ed. 2d 574, 587-88 (1997). Like\r\nprobative value, unfair prejudice should be evaluated in the practical context of the\r\nissues at stake in the trial of the case. See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545\r\nS.E.2d 827, 830 (2001) (\"The determination of prejudice must be based on the\r\nentire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.\").\r\n\r\nThe color photos contained in Exhibits 80, 81, and 83 are graphic. Exhibit 81\r\nshows Mack's scalp folded from the back of his head over his face, exposing the\r\nsurface of his entire skull. Exhibits 80 and 83 show Mack's exposed brain and the\r\ninside of his skull cap. These photos pose a danger of unfair prejudice because\r\ntheir graphic quality has some \"tendency to suggest a decision on an improper\r\nbasis.\" Holder, 382 S.C. at 290, 676 S.E.2d at 697.\r\n\r\nHowever, the objective manner in which Dr. Marcus presented the photos\r\nmitigated this tendency. Dr. Marcus's technical explanation of the autopsy process\r\nfollowed by his scientific description of the photos—both prior to the jury seeing\r\nthem—resulted in an overall discussion that was detached from the emotions of the\r\ncase and educational to the jury. Although graphic, these particular autopsy photos\r\ndo not evoke intense emotional or sympathetic reactions to the favor or detriment\r\nof either party. Thus, we find the danger of unfair prejudice from Exhibits 80, 81,\r\nand 83 was no more than moderate.\r\n\r\n             E.    Balancing Probative Value and Unfair Prejudice\r\n\r\nIn ruling on a Rule 403 objection, the trial court \"must balance the [unfair\r\nprejudice] of graphic photographs against their probative value.\" Dial, 405 S.C. at\r\n\r\n5 Rule 403 and other federal rules of evidence were amended on December 1,\r\n2011, \"as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily\r\nunderstood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.\"\r\nFed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee's note to the 2011 amendment. The changes\r\nto Rule 403 are \"stylistic only,\" with \"no intent to change any result in any ruling\r\non evidence admissibility.\" Id.\r\n\n260, 746 S.E.2d at 502 (citation omitted). In a pretrial hearing in which the parties\r\nand the court discussed the admissibility of these photos, the trial court clearly\r\nindicated it would \"review them\" and evaluate their probative value \"at the proper\r\ntime.\" When the State offered the photos into evidence during Dr. Marcus's\r\ntestimony, the trial court excused the jury from the courtroom and conducted a\r\nhearing into their admissibility. The trial court allowed the State to proffer the\r\ntestimony of Dr. Marcus as to how he would use the photos to explain his\r\ntestimony, and allowed Gray and Reese to cross-examine him.\r\n\r\nWe have noted a trial court has \"particularly wide discretion in ruling on Rule 403\r\nobjections.\" Lee, 399 S.C. at 527, 732 S.E.2d at 228. Moreover, a trial court \"is\r\nnot required to exclude relevant evidence merely because it is unpleasant or\r\noffensive.\" Dial, 405 S.C. at 260, 746 S.E.2d at 502 (citation omitted). Based on\r\nour previous findings regarding the high probative value of the photos and the\r\nmoderate danger of unfair prejudice, we find the trial court acted within its\r\ndiscretion in admitting them into evidence. See Rule 403 (providing \"relevant[]\r\nevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nGray argues, however, the photos should have been excluded based on State v.\r\nCollins, 398 S.C. 197, 727 S.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 2012), cert. granted, (Aug. 8,\r\n2013). We find Gray's reliance on Collins to be misplaced. In that case, a ten-\r\nyear-old boy was killed after being attacked by dogs. 398 S.C. at 201, 727 S.E.2d\r\nat 753. At trial, the court allowed the State to introduce autopsy photos of the\r\nboy's remains, which were \"graphic and shocking\" and \"depict[ed] a ten-year-old\r\nboy's body on an autopsy table after being partially eaten by dogs.\" 398 S.C. at\r\n202, 208, 727 S.E.2d at 754, 757. This court reversed, finding based on the unique\r\nfacts of that case, \"the probative value of the photos is minimal,\" 398 S.C. at 207,\r\n727 S.E.2d at 756, \"[t]he danger of unfair prejudice of the admitted photos is\r\nextreme,\" 398 S.C. at 209, 727 S.E.2d at 757, and \"the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in admitting the photos.\" 398 S.C. at 210, 727 S.E.2d at 758.\r\n\r\nAs we noted in Collins, and reaffirm here, both \"probative value [and] unfair\r\nprejudice should be evaluated in the practical context of the issues at stake in the\r\ntrial of the case.\" 398 S.C. at 202, 208, 727 S.E.2d at 754, 757. Focusing on the\r\nfacts of this case and putting them in the practical context of the issues at stake in\r\nthis trial, we hold the trial court acted within its discretion to admit the autopsy\r\nphotos.\r\n\r\n      III.   Conclusion\r\n\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision to admit the photos, and Gray's convictions\r\nfor murder and lynching in the first degree, are AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5241","title":"Fisher v.

(the Council)\r\nappeals the circuit court's grant of partial summary judgment to owners of\r\ncondominiums within the development in the case involving faulty windows and\r\nsliding doors. The Council argues it did not have a duty to investigate, the\r\nbusiness judgment rule should have applied, and a jury could have found it did not\r\nbreach any duty. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe condominium development Shipyard Village Horizontal Property Regime\r\n(Shipyard Village) in Pawleys Island was established in 1982 pursuant to the\r\nrecording of the Master Deed. The Council was incorporated to administer the\r\naffairs in accordance with the Bylaws through a Board of Directors (the Board).\r\nShipyard Village was built in two phases. Phase I was approved for final\r\noccupancy in 1982 and contained two buildings, A and B. Phase II was submitted\r\nto condominium ownership in 1998 and was comprised of Buildings C and D.\r\n\r\nSection 3.6(c) of the Master Deed provides that a unit's balcony doors including its\r\nframe and \"window glasses, screens, frames, and casings\" are part of each unit.\r\nSection 6.1 of the Bylaws provides the manager or the Board is responsible for the\r\nmaintenance, repair, and replacement of the common elements. Section 6.2 of the\r\nBylaws specifies that unit owners (Co-owners) are responsible for the maintenance\r\nand repair of their units. Section 5.6 of the Master Deed states maintenance,\r\nrepair, and replacement of the common elements are the Board's responsibilities\r\n\"except in the case of the negligence of a Co-owner . . . , and in the event of such\r\nnegligence, such expenses of a portion thereof may be assessed as an individual\r\nassessment.\" Additionally, section 12.1 of the Master Deed indicates that if regime\r\nproperty is damaged due to \"neglect, willful act[,] or abuse\" of a Co-owner and\r\ninsurance proceeds are insufficient to cover the cost of the damage, the deficiency\r\namount \"shall be charged to such Co-owner as an individual assessment.\" The\r\nBylaws state in section 6.4 that all maintenance, repair, and replacement expenses\r\nare common expenses except when those expenses are not fully reimbursed by\r\ninsurance proceeds and are necessitated by the failure of a Co-owner to perform\r\nthe maintenance required by the Bylaws or by the willful act, neglect, or abuse by a\r\nCo-owner, in which case they will be charged to the Co-owner as an individual\r\n\nassessment. The Master Deed does not list window flashing as one of Co-owners'\r\nresponsibilities but window frames and casings are included as Co-owners'\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Buildings A and B experienced leaks at the windows and balcony\r\ndoors. In 1993, Procon Waterproofing, Inc., which had waterproofed the buildings\r\nin 1990, informed a management company that following its preliminary\r\ninspection of the concrete structural slabs of Buildings A and B, it recommended\r\n\"a structural engineer further evaluate the cracking and spalling [that] is occurring\r\nin the pre-cast slabs and beams.\" In 1994, Procon found that all the work it\r\ncompleted in 1990 was performing as intended with no problems. It noted that for\r\nthe ocean-front windows, \"the metal end stop bead associated with the stucco\r\nsystem which was installed during the original construction over each floor band\r\nare beginning to deteriorate and rust.\" The Council had Procon replace the\r\ncorroded metal casing beads.\r\n\r\nAt the June 15, 1999 Board meeting, the Board decided to \"notify all the\r\n[Co-]owners and inform them that they are responsible for their threshold and\r\nwindow frame on their unit.\" The property manager sent a letter dated August 11,\r\n1999, to all Co-owners in Buildings A and B stating \"the waterproofing of the\r\nbalcony thresholds and windows are the responsibility of the unit owners.\" The\r\nletter provided Co-owners could waterproof their balcony thresholds and windows\r\nfor $737.50. In 1999, Henderson Waterproofing performed some stucco and\r\nconcrete repairs to Buildings A and B. Bobby Warner, the Council's maintenance\r\nsupervisor at that time, observed the work and did not believe the damage to the\r\nbuilding was as severe as Henderson did and did not think an engineer was needed\r\nto assess the buildings.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the Council hired McGee Consulting Associates to study the windows for\r\nBuildings A and B. It determined some of the windows leaked when sprayed by a\r\nhose. However, the hose testing failed to comply with the published standards for\r\nwindow leak testing. The hose test indicated \"water channels down both sides of\r\nthe windows, which starts at the top floor windows and works its way to the\r\nground. The water intrusion had caused some of the wood framing to deteriorate\r\ndue to wood-rot.\" During the investigation, McGee discovered some of the\r\nwindows had been replaced after Hurricane Hugo, in 1989, and appeared to be\r\nresidential instead of commercial and prefabricated instead of custom made.\r\nBecause the windows were prefabricated, they were smaller than the opening and\r\nwood framing had been installed to fill the gaps. The replacement windows were\r\nalso less thick than the original windows. An attorney for the Board noted issues\r\n\nwith the statute of limitations in pursuing any action for deficiencies in the\r\nreplacement windows and the original developer had filed bankruptcy in 1993.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the Council hired Keystone Construction to examine the leaks\r\nat the windows and it determined the water was leaking through the stucco instead\r\nof the windows. Keystone informed the Council the lack of window flashing was\r\npart of the cause of the leaking. It further found the windows were improperly\r\nsized and poorly installed and stucco had been used to fill the gaps around the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the owners of a unit in Building B, Ben and Katie Morrow, were having\r\nwater intrusion problems, and in 2005, they replaced their windows. They\r\ncontinued to experience leaks afterwards and hired an architect and an engineer to\r\ninvestigate the cause of the leaking. The architect found \"there is water migration\r\nthrough the exterior wall that is not related to the window sill, jamb[,] or header.\"\r\nThe new site maintenance supervisor, Richard Bennett, looked into the issue and\r\nfound sealant joint failures at the window-stucco interface along with cracked\r\nstucco could have been causing the problems. The Morrows' engineer reported at a\r\nboard meeting in 2006 that repairing one window would not solve the leak issue\r\nand an entire vertical stack of windows needed to be removed, flashed, and\r\nreplaced at the same time.\r\n\r\nBecause the Board was concerned about the uniformity of new windows,\r\ncomplying with codes, stucco being damaged during replacement, individual\r\nowners' ability to procure competent contractors, and the need to replace entire\r\nstacks at the same time, in 2006, it considered amending the Master Deed to\r\ninclude windows and sliding doors as common elements. The Board received a\r\nproposal from Pro-Tec Finishes, Inc. to replace all of the windows in Buildings A\r\nand B for a total of $2.48 million. At the annual members' meeting on April 15,\r\n2006, 71.94% of the Co-owners voted on whether to amend the Master Deed to\r\ninclude the window and sliding doors. To pass the amendment, 66.68% was\r\nneeded to vote in favor of it, but only 63.59% voted for it. The Board determined\r\nninety units had voted in favor of the amendment, eleven had voted against it, and\r\nthirty-nine had not voted. The Council decided to leave voting open for thirty days\r\nto allow the Co-owners who did not voted at the meeting or by proxy to vote.1\r\nBecause over 80% of Co-owners voted in favor of the amendment after leaving the\r\n\r\n1Section 1.5 of the Bylaws states, \"Any action which may be taken by a vote of the\r\nCo-owners may also be taken by written consent to such action signed by all [C]o­\r\nowners entitled to vote.\"\r\n\nvoting open, the Board believed the amendment had passed. An amendment to the\r\nMaster Deed recorded on October 16, 2006, added \"[t]he Limited Common\r\nElements shall also include the window glasses, screens, frames and casings\" and\r\ndeleted the language indicating the windows were a part of the unit. On November\r\n14, 2007, another amendment was recorded, stating this amendment was to correct\r\nand clarify the previously recorded amendment, which omitted adding the sliding\r\nglass doors to the common elements.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the Board hired Schneider and Associates, Inc. to investigate the water\r\nproblems for Buildings A and B. Schneider found that considering the buildings\r\nwere over thirty years old, it observed better than average building envelope\r\nperformance. Schneider performed destructive testing on the Morrows' unit and\r\ndiscovered \"'the stack' of units was leaking from top-to-bottom at the jamb and sill\r\nterminations. The existing conditions rely on the window-wall's frame\r\nconfiguration to 'turn' the water to the exterior. The spandrel, formed by the slab\r\nedge, is insufficient to accomplish this alone.\" Schneider recommended enlarging\r\nthe spandrel's vertical dimension to allow space for separate flashing assemblies.\r\nSchneider oversaw repairs for two units in Building A, but the Board was\r\ndissatisfied with its performance and lack of progress.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2007, the Board hired MEC Engineering Services, Inc. to oversee the\r\nremainder of renovations to Buildings A and B. The Board requested MEC\r\nprocure at least three bids from contractors for the repairs.\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 2008, the Board reported at the annual members' meeting Buildings A\r\nand B needed extensive repairs. The Board informed the members the cost would\r\nrange between $12 and $13 million and the Co-owners would be charged by\r\nspecial assessment. Some Co-owners of units in Buildings C and D, contacted an\r\nattorney, who sent a letter to the Board asserting the special assessment was invalid\r\nbecause the 2006 amendment was not properly approved and accordingly the cost\r\nof replacement or repairs of windows and sliding doors were the responsibility of\r\nthe individual Co-owners.\r\n\r\nIn July 2008, HICAPS presented to the Board that it had identified two primary\r\nproblems for Buildings A and B. The first problem was the structural concrete was\r\nfailing due to water and salt intrusion and the reinforcing steel's corrosion. The\r\nother problem was the building envelope was not weather tight, which allowed\r\nwater to enter the structure and caused wood to rot in walls framing the windows\r\nand sliding doors. Additionally, the paint sealer was at the end of its lifespan as\r\nwere the windows, which were failing.\r\n\nThe Board became displeased with MEC and hired Sutton-Kennerly & Associates,\r\nInc. along with Spectrum Engineering Services, Inc. to review MEC's reports,\r\nproposals, drawings, and bid specifications. Sutton-Kennerly believed the repairs\r\ncould be completed at a lower cost than MEC had specified. It also thought some\r\nof the proposals and drawings lacked sufficient details and did not agree with some\r\nof the proposed repair methods. The Board decided to discontinue MEC's services.\r\nSpectrum presented the Board with a report noting failures to the roof system,\r\nfaçade, edge beams, soffits, concrete, expansion joints, horizontal surfaces, and\r\nHVAC anchorage. Spectrum reported that rainwater was penetrating the roof, the\r\nstucco, lanai slabs, floor beams, and hollow core slabs. Spectrum found the\r\n\"windows and doors have poor to nonexistent flashing to prevent wind driven rain\r\nfrom getting into the units.\"\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, the Board requested Sutton-Kennerly to perform tests and\r\ninvestigate to determine the full scope of repairs required for Buildings A and B\r\nand supply a cost estimate. On February 16, 2009, the Board hired Sutton-\r\nKennerly to draft designs for repairs and solicit bids.\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 2009, some Building C and D Co-owners brought suit against the\r\nCouncil for breach of the Master Deed's covenants and restrictions, injunctive\r\nrelief, and declaratory judgment due to the recording of the 2006 amendment\r\nmaking windows and sliding doors common elements. Due to the challenge of the\r\n2006 amendment, on March 21, 2009, the Board called a special membership\r\nmeeting to revote on the amendment. Only 48.31% voted in favor of the\r\namendment, meaning the Co-owners were still responsible for the unit windows\r\nand sliding doors.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, the Council notified the Co-owners that repairs would occur for\r\nBuilding B from September 2009 through May 2010 and from September 2010 to\r\nMay 2011 for Building A. The repairs were estimated to cost $10,944,468. The\r\nCouncil wished to finance the repairs through a special assessment. The proposed\r\nassessment was $88,398 per unit for Buildings A and B; $64,868 per unit for three-\r\nbedroom units in Buildings C and D; and $68,471 for four-bedroom units in\r\nBuilding C and D. The assessments for Buildings A and B covered the cost to\r\nreplace their windows and doors. The Co-owners voted on August 1, 2009, on the\r\nspecial assessments. To pass the assessments, 50% plus one vote was needed, and\r\nonly 44.26% voted in favor. Council informed the members the repairs would be\r\nincorporated into the 2010 and 2011 operating budgets and would be billed\r\nmonthly to the Co-owners in addition to their regular assessments.\r\n\nOn October 7, 2009, more Building C and D Co-owners (Respondents) filed a new\r\nsuit, alleging negligence and gross negligence, negligent and gross negligent\r\nmisrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the Master Deed and\r\nrequesting a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, specific performance, and\r\njudicial dissolution of the Council. This suit was consolidated with the prior suit.\r\nThe Council hired a professional engineer, J. Lawrence Elkin, with experience in\r\ndiagnostic evaluations, building repair design, and construction project\r\nmanagement to inspect the premises and analyze the documents from the former\r\nconstruction companies and consultants that had inspected and given opinions on\r\nthe conditions of Buildings A and B. He noted \"[t]he need for the $11,000,000\r\nassessment is more directly associated with the fact that the facility is located\r\nocean front and was constructed nearly 30 years ago.\" He further stated \"similarly\r\naged and located properties undergo major rehabilitations every 25 to 30 years.\"\r\nElkin opined:The [Board] enlisted the assistance of technical experts\r\n             and consultants to provide them guidance as to the\r\n             condition of Buildings A & B. The [Board] acted in\r\n             accordance with their recommendations. At times these\r\n             recommendations were conflicting; the [Board] made\r\n             choices based on the best information at [its] disposal and\r\n             within the constraints of [its] budgets.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 2012, Respondents moved for summary judgment or partial summary\r\njudgment on their negligence and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action.\r\nFollowing a hearing, the circuit court granted Respondents' partial summary\r\njudgment motion on the issues of duty and breach for the negligence claim. It\r\ndetermined the Bylaws and Master Deed impose affirmative duties on the Board to\r\nenforce, investigate, and correct known violations of the Master Deed, the Bylaws,\r\nand South Carolina Horizontal Property Act (the Act). The court further found the\r\nCouncil breached its duty to investigate the substantial evidence in the record that\r\nreasonably showed that Co-owners had neglected the maintenance of their leaking\r\nwindows and sliding glass doors, which allegedly caused damages to the common\r\nelements of Buildings A and B. The circuit court found the business judgment rule\r\nwas not applicable because the Master Deed, Bylaws, and Act all governed the\r\nBoard's actions. The circuit court further determined the Council was precluded\r\nfrom asserting the business judgment rule based on its lack of good faith in\r\nenforcing the 2006 amendment after June 2008. The court noted that whether the\r\n\nleaking windows and doors caused any damage is for the jury to decide. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not\r\nrequiring the services of a fact finder. George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\nS.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\nmotion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). \"In a\r\nnegligence case, where the burden of proof is a preponderance of the evidence\r\nstandard, the non-moving party must only submit a mere scintilla of evidence to\r\nwithstand a motion for summary judgment.\" Bass v. Gopal, Inc., 395 S.C. 129,\r\n134, 716 S.E.2d 910, 912 (2011) (citing Hancock v. Mid-South Mgm't Co., 381\r\nS.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009)). In determining whether a genuine\r\nissue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it must\r\nbe viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\nAuth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Duty to Investigate\r\n\r\nThe Council contends the circuit court erred in finding it had a duty to investigate\r\nto determine whether to assess individual Co-owners for the damage to the\r\ncommon elements. It asserts the Master Deed and Bylaws do not contain such a\r\nduty.2 We disagree.\r\n\r\n2 The Council also asserts that if the circuit court granted summary judgment on\r\nthe fiduciary duty issue, it was error. Respondents did move for summary\r\njudgment on the issue of fiduciary duty in addition to on its breach of contract and\r\nnegligence causes of action. The order only mentions a fiduciary duty in passing\r\nand does not make specific rulings on the issue. The circuit court states its grant of\r\nsummary judgment was only on the issues of duty and breach, presumably for the\r\nnegligence cause of action. To the extent the circuit court did grant summary\r\njudgment on the issue of fiduciary duty, it is reversed. See O'Shea v. Lesser, 308\r\nS.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1992) (\"We have never imposed the high\r\nstandard of fiduciary duty on planned community organizations, such as the Board,\r\n\n\"In a negligence action, a plaintiff must show the (1) defendant owes a duty of care\r\nto the plaintiff, (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission, (3)\r\ndefendant's breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, and\r\n(4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.\" Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C.\r\n416, 429, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002). \"An essential element in a cause of action\r\nbased upon negligence is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the\r\ndefendant to the plaintiff.\" Platt v. CSX Transp., Inc., 388 S.C. 441, 445, 697\r\nS.E.2d 575, 577 (2010). \"In a negligence action, the court must determine, as a\r\nmatter of law, whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.\" Faile v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 545 (2002).\r\n\r\nWhen master deeds and bylaws show a homeowner's association has the obligation\r\nto maintain the common elements, the association has a duty to pursue a recovery\r\nfor any alleged construction defects in the common elements. Queen's Grant\r\nVillas Horizontal Prop. Regimes I-V v. Daniel Int'l Corp., 286 S.C. 555, 556, 335\r\nS.E.2d 365, 366 (1985).\r\n\r\nSection 6.1 of the Bylaws provides the manager or the Board is responsible for the\r\nmaintenance and repair of the common elements. Section 6.2 of the Bylaws\r\nprovides that \"the Units shall be maintained in good condition and repair by their\r\nrespective Co-owners.\" Section 6.3 states:\r\n\r\n             In the event that any Co-owner fails to perform the\r\n             maintenance required of him by these Bylaws or by any\r\n             lawful Regulation, and such failure creates or permits a\r\n             condition which is hazardous to life, health, or property,\r\n             or which unreasonably interferes with the rights of\r\n             another Co-owner, or which substantially detracts from\r\n             the value or appearance of the Regime Property, the\r\n             Board . . . shall, after giving such Co-owner reasonable\r\n             notice and opportunity to perform such maintenance,\r\n             cause such maintenance to be performed and charge all\r\n             reasonable expenses of so doing to such Co-owner by an\r\n             Individual Assessment.\r\n\r\nwhich are vested with the discretion to ensure that proposed modifications to\r\nresidential property enhance the entire community. Instead, under the correct\r\nstandard, the Board has a duty to exercise judgment reasonably and in good faith.\"\r\n(footnote omitted)).\r\n\nThe Bylaws state in section 6.4 that all maintenance, repair, and replacement\r\nexpenses are common expenses except when those expenses are not fully\r\nreimbursed by insurance proceeds and are necessitated by the failure of a Co-\r\nowner to provide maintenance required by the Bylaws or by the willful act,\r\nneglect, or abuse by a Co-owner, in which case they will be charged to the Co-\r\nowner as an individual assessment.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court properly granted Respondent's partial summary judgment motion\r\non whether the Council had a duty to investigate. The Council is charged with\r\nmaintaining the common elements. Should a problem arise with those elements, as\r\ndid here, the Council is responsible for pursuing any responsible parties, whether\r\nthey are Co-owners or contractors or the developer. Although some problems'\r\ncause may be obvious, here, ample evidence supports different causes. For\r\nCouncil to be able to perform its duty to try to recover from the responsible parties,\r\nit must first find out who caused the problem. Accordingly, even though the\r\nBylaws do not specifically state the Council had a duty to investigate, the duties\r\ncreated by the Bylaws and South Carolina law also support a duty to investigate\r\nwho is responsible for damage to the common elements. Therefore, the circuit\r\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment on the issue of duty.\r\n\r\nII.   Business Judgment Rule\r\n\r\nThe Council maintains the circuit court erred in determining its conduct should not\r\nbe judged by the business judgment rule. It argues the business judgment rule\r\napplies even when bylaws, the regime act, and a master deed govern conduct.\r\nFurther, it contends the circuit court erred in finding its conduct was ultra vires and\r\nthus the business judgment rule did not apply. Additionally, it asserts that even if\r\nit had committed an ultra vires act, that does not prohibit the business judgment\r\nrule from applying to intra vires actions. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"In a dispute between the directors of a homeowners association and aggrieved\r\nhomeowners, the conduct of the directors should be judged by the 'business\r\njudgment rule' and absent a showing of bad faith, dishonesty, or incompetence, the\r\njudgment of the directors will not be set aside by judicial action.\" Goddard v.\r\nFairways Dev. Gen. P'ship, 310 S.C. 408, 414, 426 S.E.2d 828, 832 (Ct. App.\r\n1993); see also Dockside Ass'n v. Detyens, 294 S.C. 86, 87, 362 S.E.2d 874, 874\r\n(1987) (\"[T]he business judgment rule precludes judicial review of actions taken\r\nby a corporate governing board absent a showing of a lack of good faith, fraud,\r\nself-dealing[,] or unconscionable conduct.\"); Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342\r\n\nS.C. 579, 599, 538 S.E.2d 15, 25 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"Under the business judgment\r\nrule, a court will not review the business judgment of a corporate governing board\r\nwhen it acts within its authority and it acts without corrupt motives and in good\r\nfaith.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). \"[T]he burden of proving good faith is\r\nnot on the governing board; the burden of proving a lack of good faith is borne,\r\nrather, by those challenging the board's actions.\" Dockside Ass'n, 294 S.C. at 87,\r\n362 S.E.2d at 874.\r\n\r\n\"[A] corporation may exercise only those powers which are granted to it by law, by\r\nits charter or articles of incorporation, and by any bylaws made pursuant thereto;\r\nacts beyond the scope of the powers so granted are ultra vires.\" Seabrook Island\r\nProp. Owners Ass'n v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App.\r\n1987). The business judgment rule only applies to intra vires acts, not ultra vires\r\nones. Kuznik, 342 S.C. at 605, 538 S.E.2d at 28. A homeowners association is\r\nbound to follow its covenants and bylaws and cannot defend something that\r\nviolates those documents on the basis that is a reasonable alternative. Seabrook\r\nIsland Prop. Owners Ass'n, 292 S.C. at 348, 356 S.E.2d at 414.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court erred in finding the business judgment rule did not apply because\r\nthe Master Deed, Bylaws, and the Act applied instead. The business judgment rule\r\napplies to actions allowed by the Master Deed, Bylaws, and Act, intra vires acts.\r\nThe rule does not extend to actions not allowed by the Master Deed, Bylaws, and\r\nAct, ultra vires acts. The circuit court also erred in finding that because the\r\nCouncil committed two acts it found to be ultra vires, the business judgment rule\r\ndid not apply to any of its actions. The rule would apply to all of its actions except\r\nfor ultra vires ones. As discussed above, the Master Deed and Bylaws did create a\r\nduty in the Council to investigate. Therefore, any investigation would be looked at\r\nunder the business judgment rule to determine if the Council met its duty. Further,\r\nthe burden is on Respondents to show the Council acted without good faith.\r\nHowever, if the Bylaws and Master Deed specified how duties should be\r\nperformed, the business judgment rule would not allow the Council to deviate from\r\nthose simply because what they did was reasonable.\r\n\r\nIII.   Breach of Duty\r\n\r\nShipyard Village asserts the circuit court erred in determining it breached a duty to\r\nRespondents. It maintains the record contains evidence it did investigate what was\r\nresponsible for the water leaking and received contradicting reports. We agree.\r\n\n\"The question of negligence is a mixed question of law and fact. First, the court\r\nmust resolve, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.\"\r\nBurnett v. Family Kingdom, Inc., 387 S.C. 183, 189, 691 S.E.2d 170, 173 (Ct. App.\r\n2010) (citation omitted). If a duty exists, the jury determines whether a breach of\r\nthe duty that resulted in damages occurred. Id.\r\n\r\nThe record contains evidence the Council did not breach its duty to investigate. It\r\nhired many construction and engineering companies and consultants to determine\r\nwhat was causing the water problems. Although some evidence was presented the\r\nwater was intruding through the doors and windows, other reports indicated the\r\nwater was coming through the stucco and roof among other ways. The Council\r\nutilized several different construction companies over the years that had conflicting\r\ntheories and solutions. The record also indicates the Board was informed by its\r\nattorneys over the years that initiating a law suit regarding the water problems\r\nwould be expensive and likely unproductive. The record contains at least a mere\r\nscintilla of evidence the Council did not breach its duty to investigate.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court erred in granting Respondents summary judgment on\r\nthis issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment on the existence of a duty\r\nto investigate. Additionally, we reverse the circuit court's decision that the\r\nbusiness judgment rule does not apply and its granting summary judgment on the\r\nissue of breach of duty and remand the case to the circuit court for trial.3\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 We decline to rule on Respondents' additional sustaining ground that the Council\r\nhad the duty to determine the cause of the \"cracking and spalling in the pre-cast\r\nslabs and beams\" in Buildings A and B that Procon observed in 1993 and 1994.\r\nSee I'On, L.L.C. v.

He argues the trial court\r\nerred in admitting a recording of the victim's mother's 911 call, in which the\r\nmother's statement to the 911 operator repeated the victim's statement of what\r\nHendricks did to her. We find the trial court correctly admitted the victim's\r\nstatement, but erroneously admitted the mother's statement. However, we find\r\nHendricks suffered no prejudice from the error, and therefore we affirm.\r\n\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nThe State indicted Hendricks for kidnapping and two counts of criminal sexual\r\nconduct in the first degree in connection with his alleged rape of the victim. At\r\ntrial, the victim testified she had known Hendricks for almost four years, and they\r\nhad an \"off and on\" romantic relationship during which they often lived together.\r\nOn the night of September 15, 2010, she heard her house shaking and thought\r\nsomebody was breaking in. She realized it was Hendricks, who \"was not himself\r\nat all. He was way out of character.\" Hendricks accused her of cheating on him,\r\nand then hit her on the arm, \"jerked [her] up by the hair on [her] head,\" and took\r\nher to a bedroom. Once in the bedroom, Hendricks slammed her head on the floor\r\nand told her to undress. She testified, \"He tells me to turn over, he doesn't want to\r\nsee my face.\" Hendricks then held her down on a bed while he \"anally sexually\r\nassaulted\" her. After the assault, she went to the bathroom, but Hendricks \"told\r\n[her] to get back in\" the bedroom. Hendricks again held her down and\r\n\"[v]aginally\" sexually assaulted her. Afterwards, Hendricks tried to \"cuddle,\" but\r\nshe refused and he left her house.\r\n\r\nThe victim testified she could only remember \"bits and pieces\" of what happened\r\nafter Hendricks left. She did remember going to the bathroom because she was\r\nvaginally and anally bleeding. She took a shower because \"there was blood\r\neverywhere.\" After showering, she woke her children and drove them to her\r\nmother's house.\r\n\r\nBefore the victim's mother—Lisa Gilstrap—testified, the State asked the trial court\r\nto address the admissibility of the recording of Gilstrap's 911 call. The State\r\nargued the recording was admissible as either a present sense impression or an\r\nexcited utterance. Hendricks objected, but the trial court indicated it would allow\r\nthe recording into evidence. The State did not play it for the jury at that time.\r\n\r\nGilstrap then testified she received a phone call from her daughter, who was crying\r\nand distraught. Her daughter told her Hendricks \"had beaten her up and raped and\r\nsodomized her.\" Gilstrap testified that when her daughter arrived at her house, she\r\nwas shaking and crying, had injuries on her face and arms, and looked like she had\r\nbeen in a fight. Gilstrap explained they first put the children to bed because they\r\nwere her daughter's \"paramount concern.\" Gilstrap then drove her daughter to the\r\nhospital because her daughter \"was not able\" to drive. Gilstrap called 911 on the\r\nway.\r\n\nThe State then moved to introduce the recording of the 911 call into evidence.\r\nHendricks renewed his objection, but the trial court admitted the recording. The\r\nState then played a portion, which contained the following dialogue:\r\n\r\n             Operator:    Pickens County Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\n             Gilstrap:    Yes, sir. This is Lisa Gilstrap.\r\n\r\n             Operator:    Um-hum.\r\n\r\n             Gilstrap:    My daughter's boyfriend just broke into her\r\n                          house, and beat her up and raped her. And\r\n                          we're on the way to Easley Hospital. And I\r\n                          was wondering if you could send an officer\r\n                          up there.\r\n\r\n             Operator:    Where did it happen?\r\n\r\n             Gilstrap:    [provides her daughter's address and states\r\n                          her daughter is in the car]\r\n\r\n             Operator:    She's already at the hospital?\r\n\r\n             Gilstrap:    No, I'm fixing to take her. We live—I live\r\n                          in Forest Acres. She's got bruises all over\r\n                          and he sodomized her.\r\n\r\n             Operator:    And what is your daughter's name?\r\n\r\n             Gilstrap:    [provides her daughter's name] She's\r\n                          twenty-two. Her two boys were there. [six-\r\n                          second pause] And his name is Matthew\r\n                          Hendricks.\r\n\r\nHendricks testified in his defense, asserting he and the victim had consensual anal\r\nand vaginal intercourse. The jury found Hendricks guilty of kidnapping and two\r\ncounts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, and the trial court sentenced\r\nhim to eight years in prison.\r\n\r\n      II.    Hearsay\r\n\n\"'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at\r\nthe trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\" in\r\nthe statement. Rule 801(c), SCRE. \"Hearsay is not admissible\" unless an\r\nexception applies, or \"as provided by . . . other rules . . . or by statute.\" Rule 802,\r\nSCRE. The State argues the recording of Gilstrap's 911 call was admissible under\r\nthe present sense impression and excited utterance exceptions. See Rule 803(1),\r\nSCRE (defining present sense impression as \"a statement describing or explaining\r\nan event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or\r\ncondition, or immediately thereafter\"); Rule 803(2), SCRE (defining excited\r\nutterance as \"a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the\r\ndeclarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\").\r\nHearsay within hearsay is admissible if each level of hearsay satisfies an exception\r\nto the hearsay rule. Rule 805, SCRE.\r\n\r\n             A.     Issue Preservation\r\n\r\nHendricks did not state his objection to the 911 recording with specificity, which\r\nraises concerns about issue preservation. See Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE (\"Error may\r\nnot be predicated upon a ruling which admits . . . evidence unless . . . a timely\r\nobjection . . . appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the\r\nspecific ground was not apparent from the context.\"). We find, however, the\r\nhearsay basis for Hendricks' objection is apparent from the context. The State\r\nimmediately responded to the objection by citing a case dealing with hearsay\r\nexceptions, and specifically argued the recording was admissible under the present\r\nsense impression and excited utterance exceptions in Rule 803(1) and (2).\r\nTherefore, the objection preserved the issue because it is clear from the record that\r\nboth the State and the trial court immediately understood Hendricks' objection was\r\nbased on hearsay. See State v. Kromah, 401 S.C. 340, 353, 737 S.E.2d 490, 497\r\n(2013) (holding an issue was preserved when \"[t]he trial court immediately\r\nappeared to understand the objection as a . . . hearsay argument\").\r\n\r\n             B.     The Victim's Statement to Gilstrap\r\n\r\nHendricks is correct the 911 recording contains two levels of hearsay. The first\r\nlevel is the victim's statement to Gilstrap reporting the details of the sexual assault\r\nand identifying Hendricks as the perpetrator. We find the victim's statement is\r\nhearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the\r\nmatter asserted in the statement—that Hendricks twice sexually assaulted her. See\r\nRule 801(c), SCRE.\r\n\nHowever, we believe the trial court acted within its discretion to admit this\r\nstatement as an excited utterance. See State v. Washington, 379 S.C. 120, 123-24,\r\n665 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2008) (stating the admission of an excited utterance \"is\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an\r\nabuse of discretion\"). As our supreme court has explained, \"the intrinsic reliability\r\nof an excited utterance derives from the statement's spontaneity[,] which is\r\ndetermined by the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statement when it\r\nwas uttered.\" State v. Ladner, 373 S.C. 103, 119-20, 644 S.E.2d 684, 693 (2007);\r\nsee also State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 20, 558 S.E.2d 518, 521 (2002) (explaining\r\n\"[t]he rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that the startling event\r\nsuspends the declarant's process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of\r\nfabrication\"); Fed. R. Evid. 803(2) advisory committee's note (stating\r\n\"[s]pontaneity is the key factor\" for admissibility of an excited utterance).\r\n\r\nThe supreme court has identified three elements a trial court must consider when\r\ndetermining whether a statement has the spontaneous quality necessary for\r\nadmission as an excited utterance: \"(1) the statement must relate to a startling event\r\nor condition; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant was under\r\nthe stress of excitement; and (3) the stress of excitement must be caused by the\r\nstartling event or condition.\" Washington, 379 S.C. at 124, 665 S.E.2d at 604.\r\n\r\nThe victim's statement satisfies these requirements for admission as an excited\r\nutterance. Her statement related to Hendricks kidnapping, beating, and raping her.\r\nThe victim's testimony about her physical and emotional state and Gilstrap's\r\ntestimony her daughter was shaking, crying, and distraught both show the victim\r\nwas under the stress of excitement when she made her statement. Gilstrap further\r\ntestified her daughter was crying, \"Momma, Momma, Momma\" on the telephone\r\nand \"just lost it\" when she got to Gilstrap's house. Finally, the evidence supports\r\nthe conclusion the sexual assault caused her stress. See Sims, 348 S.C. at 22, 558\r\nS.E.2d at 521 (noting the declarant's demeanor and the severity of the startling\r\nevent are factors a trial court should consider in determining whether a statement\r\nqualifies as an excited utterance). Thus, we find the trial court acted within its\r\ndiscretion to admit the victim's statement.\r\n\r\n             C.    Gilstrap's Statement to the 911 Operator\r\n\r\nThe second level of hearsay is Gilstrap's statement to the 911 operator repeating\r\nher daughter's statement, specifically that her daughter's \"boyfriend just broke into\r\nher house, and beat her up and raped her. . . . [H]e sodomized her. . . . And his\r\n\nname is Matthew Hendricks.\" During oral argument, the State argued Gilstrap's\r\nstatement is not hearsay because it did not offer the statement to prove the truth of\r\nthe matter asserted in the statement, but rather to explain why the police came to\r\nthe hospital. We acknowledge there may have been some minimal probative value\r\nin admitting the statement for that purpose. However, the reason the police arrived\r\nat the hospital was not a significant issue at trial. The probative value in Gilstrap's\r\nstatement was in the truth of what is asserted in the statement—that Hendricks\r\nraped and sodomized her daughter. Consequently, we find Gilstrap's statement is\r\nhearsay. See Rule 801(c), SCRE.\r\n\r\nThe State argues Gilstrap's statement is nevertheless admissible as a present sense\r\nimpression or as an excited utterance. We disagree. There are three elements to\r\nthe foundation for the admission of a hearsay statement as a present sense\r\nimpression: (1) the statement must describe or explain an event or condition; (2)\r\nthe statement must be contemporaneous with the event; and (3) the declarant must\r\nhave personally perceived the event. See Rule 803(1), SCRE; see also United\r\nStates v. Mitchell, 145 F.3d 572, 576 (3d Cir. 1998) (listing the \"three principal\r\nrequirements\" for a statement to be admissible as a present sense impression).\r\n\r\nWe find the evidence does not support the admission of Gilstrap's statement as a\r\npresent sense impression. The \"event\" Gilstrap described in her statement was the\r\nrape, which Gilstrap did not perceive. See generally State v. Davis, 371 S.C. 170,\r\n180-81 n.9, 638 S.E.2d 57, 63 n.9 (2006) (noting the declarant's statement about a\r\nshooting was not admissible as a present sense impression because there was no\r\nevidence the declarant saw the shooting). Moreover, though Gilstrap's statement\r\nmight have been contemporaneous with her daughter's statement, it was not\r\ncontemporaneous with the rape.\r\n\r\nThe State also argues Gilstrap's statement was admissible as an excited utterance.\r\nWe recognize Gilstrap must have had an intense emotional reaction when she first\r\nheard her daughter had been raped. However, the State has not shown the nature\r\nof her reaction was such that it generated the spontaneity that gives an excited\r\nutterance its inherent reliability. See Ladner, 373 S.C. at 119-20, 644 S.E.2d at\r\n693. Moreover, the State did not show Gilstrap was still under the required stress\r\nof excitement when she actually made her statement. See Davis, 371 S.C. at 180,\r\n638 S.E.2d at 62 (finding the State elicited no evidence the declarant \"was still\r\nunder the stress or excitement of [the victim's] shooting,\" and \"[t]herefore, the\r\nState did not meet its burden of establishing a foundation for the excited\r\nutterance\").\r\n\nFirst, Gilstrap did not immediately call 911 when her daughter called and told her\r\nwhat happened. Instead, she waited for her daughter to arrive at her house, giving\r\nher time to reflect on what her daughter told her. Contra State v. McHoney, 344\r\nS.C. 85, 94-95, 544 S.E.2d 30, 34-35 (2001) (concluding the declarant's statement\r\nwas an excited utterance and \"inherently reliable\" because \"[t]here was no time for\r\nthe [declarant] to reflect on the event\"). Second, Gilstrap helped her daughter put\r\nthe children to bed before calling 911. Third, Gilstrap testified she drove the car\r\nbecause her daughter \"was not able.\" Gilstrap was calm enough to drive, and her\r\nvoice sounds calm on the audio recording of the 911 call.\r\n\r\nFinally, the statement itself indicates Gilstrap was not speaking spontaneously, and\r\nher process of reflective thought had not been suspended. See Sims, 348 S.C. at\r\n20, 558 S.E.2d at 521. Her request that the 911 operator send an officer to the\r\nhospital demonstrated the purpose of her call was in large part to initiate criminal\r\nprosecution against Hendricks. Gilstrap also told the 911 operator, \"He has beat\r\nher up before but he has never raped her\"; \"He has charges pending\"; and \"I have a\r\ntrespassing notice on him here.\"1 These comments have nothing to do with her\r\ndaughter's welfare or need for medical attention, but show Gilstrap reflected on\r\nthese past events and then attempted to convince the 911 operator Hendricks\r\ndeserved to be prosecuted. Cf. Fed. R. Evid. 803(2) advisory committee's note\r\n(\"The theory of [the excited utterance exception] is simply that circumstances may\r\nproduce a condition of excitement which temporarily stills the capacity of\r\nreflection and produces utterances free of conscious fabrication.\"); Rule 803,\r\nSCRE, note (providing South Carolina's exception for excited utterances is\r\nidentical to the federal rule). Thus, we find the record does not support the\r\nadmission of the statement as an excited utterance, and the trial court did not act\r\nwithin its discretion when it admitted Gilstrap's statement to the 911 operator.\r\n\r\n      III.   Admission of Gilstrap's Statement Caused No Prejudice\r\n\r\nDespite the error in the admission of Gilstrap's statement, we find Hendricks\r\nsuffered no prejudice. See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 288, 625 S.E.2d 641, 646\r\n(2006) (\"The improper admission of hearsay is reversible error only when the\r\nadmission causes prejudice.\"). The substance of Gilstrap's out-of-court statement\r\nwas already in evidence through her and the victim's trial testimony, before the\r\ntrial court admitted the 911 recording. Specifically, Gilstrap testified her daughter\r\ncalled and told her Hendricks \"had beaten her up and raped and sodomized her.\"\r\n\r\n1 The three comments quoted in this sentence are from a portion of the 911\r\nrecording that was not played for the jury.\r\n\nThis testimony contained only one level of hearsay and was properly admitted\r\nbecause the victim's statement to Gilstrap qualified as an excited utterance. The\r\nvictim also testified she called her mother and told her what Hendricks did to her.\r\nThe victim's testimony was admitted without objection before the admission of the\r\n911 recording.\r\n\r\nHendricks argues the admission of Gilstrap's statement caused him prejudice\r\nbecause it corroborated the victim's trial testimony. He relies on State v.\r\nWhisonant, 335 S.C. 148, 515 S.E.2d 768 (Ct. App. 1999), in which we stated,\r\n\"'Improper corroboration testimony that is merely cumulative to the victim's\r\ntestimony . . . cannot be harmless, because it is precisely this cumulative effect\r\nwhich enhances the devastating impact of improper corroboration.'\" 335 S.C. at\r\n156, 515 S.E.2d at 772 (emphasis in original) (quoting Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17,\r\n21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994)). However, this case is distinguishable from Jolly\r\nand Whisonant because the evidence that Hendricks argues impermissibly\r\ncorroborated the victim's testimony was properly admitted in evidence through\r\nGilstrap's trial testimony. Thus, the corroboration that Hendricks contends was\r\nimproperly achieved by Gilstrap's statement had already been properly\r\naccomplished by live testimony. The admission of Gilstrap's statement, therefore,\r\ndid not prejudice Hendricks because it was cumulative to properly admitted\r\nevidence that corroborated the testimony of the victim. Any further corroboration\r\nof the victim's trial testimony by Gilstrap's statement on the 911 recording was\r\nminimal. See State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 478, 716 S.E.2d 91, 93-94 (2011)\r\n(\"Improperly admitted hearsay which is merely cumulative to other evidence may\r\nbe viewed as harmless.\").\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find Hendricks has not demonstrated prejudice from the\r\nerroneous admission of Gilstrap's statement. See State v. Brockmeyer, 406 S.C.\r\n324, 356, 751 S.E.2d 645, 662 (2013) (holding \"the improper admission of hearsay\r\nconstitutes reversible error only when it results in prejudice, [and because the\r\nappellant] failed to show he was prejudiced, [he] failed to show reversible error\").\r\n\r\n      IV.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe trial court acted within its discretion to admit the victim's statement on the 911\r\nrecording, but erred in admitting Gilstrap's statement. However, we find\r\nHendricks suffered no prejudice from this error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.\r\n\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5242","title":"Fore v.

The single commissioner\r\nawarded Patricia Fore compensation based on his finding that Fore's work-related\r\ninjury resulted in a forty percent disability to the back. Fore appealed to the\r\nappellate panel, which affirmed the award. Fore now appeals to this court. We\r\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Fore began working as a meat cutter in a Griffin IGA in Myrtle Beach.\r\nHer responsibilities included unloading trucks, rotating and cleaning coolers, and\r\ncarrying items weighing forty to eighty pounds.\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 2008, Fore was injured when she bumped into some machinery\r\nwhile carrying about sixty pounds of meat. After March 31, 2008, Fore ceased\r\nworking at IGA and moved to Leesburg, Georgia, with her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing on August 12, 2009, a single commissioner found Fore suffered\r\ncompensable injuries to her back and right hip and her back injury affected her\r\nright leg. Fore's employer, Griffco of Wampee, Inc., and its carrier, Chartis\r\nClaims, Inc. (collectively Respondents), were ordered to assume responsibility for\r\nall causally related treatment and to pay Fore temporary total disability\r\ncommencing on March 31, 2008, Fore's final day of employment at IGA.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 2010, Fore underwent a lumbar fusion. The surgery was not\r\nsuccessful, resulting in a non-union and failed back syndrome. In August 2010,\r\nDr. Wolgin, Fore's treating physician, after consulting with Fore's case manager,\r\nreferred Fore to therapy and allowed her to perform sedentary work with\r\nrestrictions regarding weightlifting and movement.\r\n\r\nFore commenced part-time work as a clerk for ABC Bail Bonds (ABC). In\r\nSeptember, Fore told Dr. Wolgin she was working only three hours per day and\r\nthree days per week in an \"office setting\"; however, she actually worked twenty or\r\nmore hours per week for ABC. She also performed courier services for a towing\r\nservice owned by Steve McGowan, the owner of ABC. McGowan paid Fore eight\r\ndollars per hour in cash for her work, and Fore never completed a time card in her\r\nown name.\r\n\r\nBy October 2010, Fore completed a month of physical therapy; however, her\r\ncondition did not improve, and she reported increased pain in her hip and back\r\nfrom sleeping in a bed. As a result of these circumstances, Dr. Wolgin wrote a\r\nwork slip in which he stated Fore was unable to work until further notice.\r\n\r\nFore left ABC on January 21, 2011, maintaining she could not perform her duties\r\nbecause of excessive pain from having to alternate between sitting and standing\r\npositions. McGowan, however, alleged Fore wanted to work more hours and even\r\nwent to Atlanta to obtain her certification as a bail bond agent. According to\r\nMcGowan, Fore increased her hours, eventually working thirty to thirty-five hours\r\n\nper week, and told him she was leaving ABC because she needed to earn more\r\nmoney to pay for her child's daycare.\r\n\r\nDr. Wolgin suggested additional surgery, but Fore declined this option for several\r\nreasons: her chance of improvement was only fifty percent, her prior surgery had\r\nbeen painful, and she was busy caring for a young child. After consulting both\r\nFore and her attorney, Dr. Wolgin closed Fore's case on February 14, 2011, and\r\ndeclared she reached maximum medical improvement on that date. Dr. Wolgin\r\nalso assigned Fore a thirty-six percent whole person impairment rating.\r\n\r\nSometime in February 2011, Fore was approached by Tony Owens, a longtime\r\nfriend and the operator of A-1 Bail Bonding (A-1), one of ABC's competitors.\r\nOwens requested Fore's permission to use her name and license because she was\r\nwell known in the community. Fore transferred her license to A-1 and completed\r\none bond herself for A-1 to make the transfer effective. Fore also allowed Owens,\r\nat his expense, to place advertising for A-1 on the back window of her truck. The\r\nadvertising included a telephone number for A-1 that could be called any time of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIn July 2011, Owens developed serious health problems and was unable to work.\r\nFore claimed that because of Owens's difficulties, she agreed to complete a few\r\nbonds for A-1 without compensation until Owens could train someone else for the\r\nwork. Fore was responsible for obtaining five bonds in July 2011, twelve bonds in\r\nAugust 2011, and one bond in September 2011. She maintained her only physical\r\nexertion in obtaining the bonds was to travel to the courthouse to sign for them.\r\nEventually, Owens hired someone to do the work that Fore had been doing, and\r\nFore assisted that person to obtain the necessary credentials.\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 2011, McGowan called the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission (the Commission) to report that Fore was committing insurance fraud\r\nby working for A-1 and being paid \"off the books.\" According to notes taken by\r\nGarry Smith, the Director of the Commission's Compliance Division, McGowan\r\naccused Fore of obtaining and serving bonds, which included traveling to the\r\nlockup in Leesburg to get her clients released. McGowan also alleged Fore took\r\nher niece with her, and he surmised the niece was initialing the release sheets as a\r\nsubterfuge.\r\n\r\nSmith included this information in a letter he wrote on July 18, 2011, to the\r\nInsurance Fraud Division of the Office of the South Carolina Attorney General.\r\nThis letter was written on Commission letterhead and detailed Smith's conversation\r\n\nwith McGowan. It also included notes about A-1 taken by an investigator for the\r\nCommission. Although acknowledging Chartis Claims, the carrier, was not an\r\n\"authorized agency\" entitled to receive information about the alleged fraud from\r\nthe Commission, Smith wrote: \"I suggest the carrier needs to know an allegation of\r\nfraud has been made so it can conduct an investigation, should it deem an\r\ninvestigation is warranted.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 2011, an assistant deputy attorney general forwarded Smith's letter to\r\nChartis for review and appropriate action along with a cover letter requesting\r\nChartis to inform the South Carolina Attorney General's Office of any findings\r\nconcerning insurance fraud. Neither Fore nor her attorney received copies of either\r\nthe cover letter or Smith's letter.\r\n\r\nOn August 30, 2011, McGowan took video footage of Fore sitting with a client at\r\nthe jail in Lee County, Georgia. This event prompted Fore to obtain a restraining\r\norder against McGowan.\r\n\r\nThe record on appeal also includes surveillance footage obtained on September 7\r\nand 8, 2011. This footage shows (1) an A-1 sign near Fore's residence, (2) Fore\r\nentering, driving, and exiting an SUV without any noticeable difficulty, and (3)\r\nFore squatting down numerous times to pick up merchandise from a low shelf in a\r\ndepartment store. The record also includes a copy of Fore's Facebook page dated\r\nSeptember 19, 2011, in which Fore gave her occupation as a \"Professional\r\nBondsman.\" She also described herself \"Self Employed and Loving It!\" and\r\nindicated her services were available.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 2011, Vocational Consultant Glen Adams performed a\r\nvocational assessment on Fore based on Fore's medical records, work history, and\r\nstatements she made during a telephone interview. In his report, Adams stated that\r\nbased on Fore's limited sitting and standing tolerances, he considered Fore to be\r\n\"totally vocationally disabled\" as a result of the injuries she sustained while\r\nworking at IGA. Adams also found there was no reasonably stable labor market\r\ncompatible with Fore's vocational profile and resulting residual physical capacities.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2011, Fore filed a request for hearing with the Commission, in which\r\nshe asked for a lump sum award to be prorated over her lifetime. Fore asserted she\r\nwas totally and permanently disabled from her injury or, in the alternative, she had\r\nsustained a greater than fifty percent loss of use of her back, which would entitle\r\nher to a partial disability award based on five hundred weeks. On July 27, 2011,\r\nRespondents filed their answer to Fore's request. They admitted Fore was entitled\r\n\nto temporary total disability from the time she left her employment at IGA through\r\nthe date she reached maximum medical improvement, but denied her 2008 injury\r\ncaused a permanent and total disability.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 2011, Fore served her Pre-hearing Brief and Notice of\r\nWitnesses. Respondents served their Pre-hearing Brief and Notice of Witnesses on\r\nSeptember 19, 2011, including in their list of exhibits \"[c]orrespondence from the\r\nS.C. Attorney General's Office.\" The following day, Fore served an amended Pre-\r\nhearing Brief and Notice of Witnesses, in which she added Owens, who was not\r\nlisted on her earlier notice.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner heard the matter on September 27, 2011. When the\r\nhearing began, Fore objected to Respondents' first exhibit, which contained both\r\nSmith's July 18, 2011 letter and the July 20, 2011 letter from the Attorney\r\nGeneral's Office to Chartis. Fore argued this evidence was inadmissible as an ex\r\nparte communication and hearsay. She also contended the letters were\r\ninadmissible evidence of a pending criminal prosecution. In addition to asking the\r\nsingle commissioner to exclude the evidence, she requested that the entire South\r\nCarolina Workers' Compensation Commission be recused from adjudicating her\r\ncase and that a circuit court judge or other impartial referee, such as a former\r\ncommissioner, be appointed to hear the matter. The single commissioner removed\r\nthe letter from the Attorney General's Office from the record, but overruled Fore's\r\nobjection to Smith's letter. He also denied Fore's request to appoint someone\r\noutside the Commission to hear her case.\r\n\r\nThe hearing then proceeded on the merits. When Fore called Owens to testify as a\r\nrebuttal witness on her behalf, Respondents objected, arguing that Owens was not\r\nnamed in Fore's original Pre-hearing Brief and Notice of Witnesses and that Fore's\r\namended documents, which included Owens as a witness, were untimely. The\r\nsingle commissioner allowed Fore to proffer Owens as a witness, but left the\r\nhearing room when Owens testified.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2012, the single commissioner issued an order finding Fore's injury\r\nresulted in a forty percent disability to the back. The single commissioner noted he\r\nmade this finding \"[a]fter considering all of the evidence.\" He also stated he did\r\nnot find Fore to be a credible witness and stated he believed she could work.\r\n\r\nBased on his finding that Fore suffered a forty percent permanent partial disability\r\nto the back, the single commissioner granted Respondents a credit for overpayment\r\nof temporary total benefits from February 14, 2011, the date Fore reached MMI.\r\n\nFore appealed to the appellate panel, which affirmed the single commissioner's\r\norder, modifying it only to include additional findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw that addressed Fore's allegations of ex parte communication. Fore now\r\nappeals to this court.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL1\r\n\r\nI.    Did the single commissioner and appellate panel err in failing to recuse\r\nthemselves on the ground that the Commission engaged in improper ex parte\r\ncontact with Respondents by instructing the Attorney General's Office to forward\r\nSmith's letter to Respondents without notifying Fore?\r\n\r\nII.    Should the single commissioner have excluded Smith's letter because it (1)\r\nconstituted an ex parte communication, (2) contained inadmissible hearsay, (3)\r\nwas more prejudicial than probative, and (4) denied Fore the opportunity to\r\nconduct meaningful discovery to rebut Respondents' evidence against her?\r\n\r\nIII. Should Fore have been allowed to call Owens as a rebuttal witness in\r\nresponse to the testimony of Steve McGowan?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, an appellate court can\r\nreverse or modify a decision of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission \"where the substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced\r\nbecause the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view\r\nof the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence considering the record as a\r\nwhole.\" Trotter v. Trane Coil Facility, 393 S.C. 637, 644, 714 S.E.2d 289, 293\r\n(2011).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Fore has also raised challenges to the decision to base Fore's final award on a\r\nfinding that her injury resulted in a forty percent disability to her back and to an\r\nalleged procedural irregularity during the hearing before the appellate panel. We\r\ndecline to address these questions in view of our disposition of the other issues\r\nFore has raised in her appeal. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not\r\nreview remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\nappeal).\r\n\nI.    Allegation of Ex Parte Communication and Recusal of the Commission\r\n\r\nFore first argues the Commission engaged in ex parte communication with\r\nMcGowan and Chartis and, as result of these interactions, deprived her of a fair\r\ntrial. She further maintains that all sitting commissioners should have been\r\ndisqualified from hearing the matter because of the alleged ex parte\r\ncommunication. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"[E]x parte communication is defined as 'prohibited communication between\r\ncounsel and the court when opposing counsel is not present.'\" Brown v. Bi-Lo,\r\nInc., 354 S.C. 436, 440 n.3, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 n.3 (2003) (quoting Black's Law\r\nDictionary 597 (7th Ed. 1999)). The Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits a judge\r\nfrom initiating, permitting, or considering ex parte communications unless the\r\njudge takes certain precautions, including but not limited to notifying the other\r\nparties of the substance of the ex parte communication and giving them the\r\nopportunity to respond. Rule 501, SCACR, Canon 3(B)(7)(a)(ii).\r\n\r\nAccording to Fore, the ex parte communication occurred when Smith, in his\r\ncapacity as Director of the Compliance Division of the Commission, sent the\r\ninformation he received from McGowan to the South Carolina Attorney General's\r\nOffice and included \"explicit instructions to forward it to a party in this case.\"\r\nHowever, in contacting the Fraud Division of the Office of the South Carolina\r\nAttorney General about McGowan's accusations against Fore, Smith was only\r\ndischarging duties required of the Commission by statute. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n38-55-570(A) (2002) (requiring \"any . . . authorized agency having reason to\r\nbelieve that another has made a false statement or misrepresentation\" to \"notify the\r\nInsurance Fraud Division of the Office of the Attorney General of the knowledge\r\nor belief and provide any additional information within his possession relative\r\nthereto\"). Furthermore, contrary to Fore's version of the facts, Smith merely\r\nsuggested that the carrier be made aware of McGowan's allegation and did not\r\ninstruct the Attorney General to convey this information to Chartis. Finally, in\r\nmaking the suggestion, Smith was advising the Attorney General's Office of a\r\ncourse of action that it had a right to follow and never expressed a desire that the\r\nAttorney General take any action on the Commission's behalf. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 38-55-580(D) (2002) (providing immunity for \"persons identified as designated\r\nemployees whose responsibilities include the investigation and disposition of\r\nclaims related to suspected fraudulent insurance acts\" when they share information\r\nabout such acts with properly designated employees of \"the same or other insurers\r\nwhose responsibilities include the investigation and disposition of claims related to\r\nfraudulent insurance acts\").\r\n\nWe therefore hold that Fore has not established that any ex parte communication\r\noccurred between Respondents and the Commission. Furthermore, because Fore's\r\nassertion of ex parte communication is the only ground she advanced to support\r\nher argument that the Commission should have recused itself from hearing her\r\nclaim, we need not address her argument that an independent hearing officer not\r\ncurrently affiliated with the Commission should have been appointed to decide this\r\nmatter.2\r\n\r\nII.   Inclusion of Smith's Letter in the Record\r\n\r\nFore also contends that Smith's letter should have been removed from the record\r\nbefore the single commissioner because it was an ex parte communication,\r\ncontained inadmissible hearsay, was more prejudicial than probative, and was\r\npresented in such a way as to deprive Fore of the opportunity to conduct\r\nmeaningful discovery. Although we have held the letter was not an ex parte\r\ncommunication, we agree with Fore that the letter should have been removed from\r\nthe record because it contained hearsay and was unduly prejudicial to her.\r\nFurthermore, because of the nature of the communication, Fore was deprived of\r\nsufficient opportunity to investigate the evidence Respondents presented to support\r\ntheir position that she was capable of working.\r\n\r\nWhen Fore objected to Smith's letter, Respondents' attorney argued the letter was\r\n\"simply evidence that there is a fraud investigation ongoing by the A.G.'s office in\r\nthis claim.\" The single commissioner agreed and denied Fore's motion to remove\r\nthe letter from the record, stating the letter was \"in the commission file\" and had\r\n\"been made a part of the record or will be made a part of the record.\"\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of Smith's letter among the materials before the single\r\ncommissioner, however, whether this occurred before or during the hearing, was in\r\nviolation of sections 38-55-510 through -590 of the South Carolina Code (2002),\r\notherwise known as the Omnibus Insurance Fraud and Reporting Immunity Act.\r\nAs to the availability of information about fraudulent insurance claims under\r\ninvestigation, the Act provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 In any event, we found no authority to support Fore's argument that recusal of the\r\nCommission would have been the only appropriate remedy if she had established\r\nthat the Commission engaged in ex parte communication with Chartis, and Fore\r\nhas not cited any binding precedent to support her position.\r\n\n            Except as otherwise provided by law, any information\r\n            furnished pursuant to this section is privileged and shall\r\n            not be part of any public record. Any information or\r\n            evidence furnished to an authorized agency pursuant to\r\n            this section is not subject to subpoena or subpoena duces\r\n            tecum in any civil or criminal proceeding unless, after\r\n            reasonable notice to any person, insurer, or authorized\r\n            agency which has an interest in the information and after\r\n            a subsequent hearing, a court of competent jurisdiction\r\n            determines that the public interest and any ongoing\r\n            investigation will not be jeopardized by obedience of the\r\n            subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-55-570(D) (2002) (emphasis added). Therefore, although\r\nSmith's letter may have been part of the Commission's file, it should have been\r\nsegregated from those portions of the file that could be viewed by members of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWe also agree with Fore that this letter was hearsay evidence of an as-yet unproven\r\nallegation that she had committed insurance fraud. Furthermore, without a final\r\ndetermination of the truth of this allegation, we hold the prejudice to Fore from\r\nadmitting the letter exceeded any probative value to be gained from its inclusion in\r\nthe record. Cf. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Lisa C., 380 S.C. 406, 417, 669 S.E.2d\r\n647, 653 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding that testimony that law enforcement had\r\nprobable cause to proceed with a criminal investigation against a parent was\r\nprejudicial because the evidence suggested the parent was guilty of sexual\r\nmisconduct toward his child). Moreover, because the letter was most likely not\r\naccessible to Fore or any other member of the public and Fore was thus unaware of\r\nthe letter until only eight days before her hearing, she was deprived of the\r\nopportunity to conduct meaningful discovery that may have enabled her to refute\r\nRespondent's allegations that her claims were spurious.\r\n\r\nConsidering all these circumstances, we hold the single commissioner should have\r\ngranted Fore's request to remove Smith's letter from the record. We acknowledge\r\nthere may have been substantial evidence to support a finding that Fore was\r\ncapable of working and suffered only a partial disability; however, Fore's\r\ntestimony about her condition, the work restrictions imposed by Dr. Wolgin, and\r\nthe vocational assessment prepared by Glen Adams would have been substantial\r\nevidence supporting a different finding. Fore's credibility, then, was an important\r\nfactor, and the single commissioner expressly found Fore was not a credible\r\n\nwitness. Contrary to a statement in the appellate panel's order that there was no\r\nevidence that the single commissioner considered Smith's letter in determining\r\nFore's award, the single commissioner himself indicated otherwise when, after\r\ndenying Fore's motion on the ground that the letter was already an exhibit in the\r\ncommission file, he stated in his order that (1) his findings of fact were \"[b]ased\r\nupon the testimony and exhibits submitted\" and (2) he found Fore had suffered\r\nonly a forty percent permanent partial disability to the back \"[a]fter considering all\r\nof the evidence.\"\r\n\r\nWe therefore agree with Fore that the single commissioner's order was affected by\r\nan error of law because of the single commissioner's refusal to exclude from the\r\nrecord an exhibit that Respondents readily admitted was evidence of an ongoing\r\nfraud investigation. Nevertheless, \"[t]he final determination of witness credibility\r\nand the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.\"\r\nHamilton v. Martin Color-Fi, Inc., 405 S.C. 478, 487, 748 S.E.2d 76, 81 (Ct. App.\r\n2013) (citing Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442\r\n(2000)). Here, although we disagree with the appellate panel's interpretation of the\r\nsingle commissioner's order, the appellate panel clearly stated in its own order that\r\nit \"does not rely on any information contained in the letter from the Commission to\r\nthe Attorney General.\" Considering this unequivocal statement along with\r\nRespondents' evidence that Fore was not permanently and totally disabled, we hold\r\nFore failed to establish that her substantial rights were prejudiced as a result of\r\neither an error of law in the appellate panel's decision or clearly erroneous findings\r\nof fact by the appellate panel.\r\n\r\nIII.   Testimony of Tony Owens\r\n\r\nFore further argues the single commissioner should not have refused to hear\r\nOwens's rebuttal testimony solely because he was not listed on her original Pre-\r\nhearing Brief and Notice of Witnesses and her attempt to amend these documents\r\nto include him was untimely. We agree.\r\n\r\nState regulations require an attorney representing a party at a workers'\r\ncompensation hearing to file and serve a Pre-hearing Brief (Form 58). 8 S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Regs. 67-611.B (2012). The attorney must \"[f]ile a Form 58 and proof of\r\nservice at least ten days before the hearing with the Hearing Commissioner's office\r\nidentified on the hearing notice.\" 8 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-611.B(1) (2012).\r\nThe Form 58 must \"give the names and addresses of persons known to the parties\r\nor counsel to be witnesses concerning the facts of the case . . . .\" Id. Furthermore,\r\na party must \"promptly supplement a response with respect to any question directly\r\n\naddressed on the form and amend a response if the party obtains information upon\r\nthe basis of which the party knows the response was incorrect when made . . . .\"\r\nId.\r\nFore served her original Pre-hearing Brief and Notice of Witnesses on September\r\n12, 2011, more than ten days before the hearing on September 27, 2011. On\r\nSeptember 20, 2011, the day she received Respondents' Pre-hearing Brief and\r\nNotice of Witnesses, Fore immediately filed and served her Amended Pre-hearing\r\nBrief and Notice. Regulation 67-611, though expressly imposing a deadline for\r\nfiling and serving the Pre-hearing Brief, also requires parties to supplement their\r\nresponses when warranted. This regulation, however, does not impose a deadline\r\nfor disclosure of new information when that information is provided in an effort to\r\namend a prior response. Absent any express time constraint for amending a Pre-\r\nhearing Brief, we hold that Fore, in promptly supplementing her Pre-hearing Brief\r\nto include Owens as a witness, complied with Regulation 67-611 and that the\r\nsingle commissioner erred in refusing to allow Fore to call Owens as a rebuttal\r\nwitness. See Lizee v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 367 S.C. 122, 130 n.2, 623\r\nS.E.2d 860, 864 n.2 (Ct. App. 2005) (recognizing \"the informal nature of\r\nadministrative proceedings before the Commission\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the single commissioner should not have refused to hear Owens's rebuttal\r\ntestimony and therefore remand this matter to the Commission for a\r\nredetermination of Fore's benefits with the directive that full consideration be given\r\nto Owens's testimony. We further hold the letter from Garry Smith to the\r\nInsurance Fraud Division of the Office of the South Carolina Attorney General was\r\nnot an ex parte communication between Respondents and the Commission and\r\nFore is therefore not entitled to have an independent tribunal appointed to\r\ndetermine her benefits. Although we hold that Fore did not show prejudice from\r\nthe single commissioner's refusal to remove Smith's letter from the record, we\r\nagree with Fore that this refusal was error. In view of our decision to remand the\r\nmatter to allow Fore to call Owens as a rebuttal witness, then, we also direct that\r\non remand Garry Smith's letter be removed from the record. If Smith's letter\r\nremains in the Commission's file, it shall be segregated from the publicly available\r\nportions of the file as required by subsection 38-55-570(D) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2002).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5243","title":"Levi v.

She contends the single commissioner's denial of\r\nNorthern Anderson County EMS (EMS) and its carrier's, Berkshire Hathaway\r\nHomestate Insurance Company, (collectively, Employer) motion to dismiss was\r\nnot immediately appealable. Levi also argues the question of whether she settled\r\n\nher third-party claim is not ripe for review. We vacate the Appellate Panel's\r\ndecision and remand to the Appellate Panel for it to dismiss the appeal.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nLevi worked as a paramedic for EMS. On March 10, 2011, she injured her back\r\nwhile moving a patient. Later that month, on March 29, she was riding in an\r\nambulance as part of her employment when another driver (the third party) rear-\r\nended the ambulance. Levi filed workers' compensation claims for both injuries,\r\nwhich Employer accepted. Levi began receiving temporary disability in May of\r\n2011 and had back surgery in July of that year.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, 2011, Employer filed a motion to dismiss both claims. It\r\nasserted Levi had accepted a $550 check from the third party's insurance company\r\nthree weeks after the car accident. It contended this was a settlement of her third-\r\nparty claim.1 It maintained because she had not notified Employer or the Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission (the Commission) of the settlement as provided by\r\nsection 42-1-560 of the South Carolina Code, she had elected her remedy. It\r\nasserted her right to recover workers' compensation benefits was therefore barred.2\r\n\r\nLevi contended she had not settled her claim against the third party. She\r\nmaintained the $550 payment was limited to compensation for her pain and\r\nsuffering from the accident and she had not signed a document releasing anyone\r\n\r\n1 A letter from the third party's insurance company, dated April 10, 2011, stated: \"I\r\nwill be sending a check to you . . . in the amount of $550.00 for full and final\r\nsettlement o[f] your injury claim. Please understand that signing and cashing this\r\ncheck settles your claim from the above accident. Any medical expenses incurred\r\nby you from this loss will be presented to us from your Workman Compensation\r\nAdjuster.\" On September 9, 2011, Allstate sent a letter to Employer's attorney\r\nstating, \"We have yet to receive any medical bills or reports with respect to the\r\ninjury sustained by . . . Levi.\" On December 29, 2011, the insurance company sent\r\na letter to Levi's attorney, which stated: \"This will confirm that Allstate paid and\r\nMs. Levi cashed a settlement check for $550.00. This was for her pain an[d]\r\nsuffering only with the understanding we would pay for the reasonable and related\r\nmedical bills.\"\r\n2 \"[T]he settlement of a third party claim without notice to the employer and carrier\r\nbars a workers' compensation action.\" Kimmer v. Murata of Am., Inc., 372 S.C.\r\n39, 52, 640 S.E.2d 507, 513-14 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\nfrom liability. She contended she had informed Employer of the $550 payment\r\nand both the owner of EMS and the worker' compensation insurance adjuster had\r\nadvised her to accept the money.\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 2012, the single commissioner denied the motion to dismiss. It\r\nfound the $550 payment was for pain and suffering and ordered a hearing to\r\ndetermine if Levi had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) or if she\r\nneeded additional medical treatment.\r\n\r\nEmployer appealed to the Appellate Panel, which reversed the single commissioner\r\nand dismissed Levi's claims in an order dated July 2, 2012. The Appellate Panel\r\nfound Levi had settled with the third party and had not notified Employer or the\r\nCommission. It determined that therefore Levi had elected her remedy. It found\r\nbecause Levi did not comply with the statute, she had deprived the Commission of\r\njurisdiction of the claim. It also determined her injuries were solely due to the car\r\naccident. This appeal followed.3\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nLevi argues this court should vacate the Appellate Panel's decision. She maintains\r\nthe single commissioner's ruling was not immediately appealable because it was\r\nnot an award but instead a denial of a motion to dismiss. Although she did not\r\nraise this to the Appellate Panel, she contends appealability can be raised at any\r\ntime. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"Only issues raised [to] and ruled on by the commission are cognizable on appeal.\"\r\nStone v. Roadway Express, 367 S.C. 575, 582, 627 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2006).\r\nHowever, \"[a]n appellate court may dismiss an appeal or error proceeding on its\r\nown motion where it appears from the record that the court is without jurisdiction\r\nor that the judgment sought to be reviewed is not final, among numerous other\r\n\r\n\r\n3 On March 5, 2013, after the filing of the Appellate Panel's order, Levi filed a\r\nlawsuit against the third party in the court of common pleas. That suit, Levi v.\r\nProell, 2013-CP-23-01287, is pending in Greenville County court of common\r\npleas. It is scheduled for a roster meeting on December 8, 2014.

Burkey v. Noce, 398 S.C. 35, 37, 726 S.E.2d\r\n229, 230 (Ct. App. 2012). In Cooke v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 367 S.C. 167,\r\n173, 624 S.E.2d 439, 442 (Ct.

The circuit court\r\nrejected this defense, but the merits of the Cookes' action ha[d] yet to be\r\ndetermined.\" This court accordingly found the circuit court's order interlocutory.\r\nId.\r\n\r\nIn Allison v. W.L. Gore & Associates, an employee appealed the single\r\ncommissioner's order to the Appellate Panel two days after the fourteen-day\r\ndeadline for filing an appeal. 394 S.C. 185, 187, 714 S.E.2d 547, 549 (2011). The\r\nemployer moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing it was untimely and thus the\r\nAppellate Panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Id. The Appellate Panel denied\r\nthe motion to dismiss and upheld the denial of benefits to the employee. Id. The\r\nemployee appealed to the circuit court, and the employer raised the fact that the\r\nappeal to the Appellate Panel was untimely. Id. The circuit court determined that\r\nbecause the Employer failed to take an immediate appeal, the ruling that the\r\nAppellate Panel had subject matter jurisdiction over the employee's appeal was the\r\nlaw of the case. Id. On appeal, the supreme court determined the circuit court\r\nerred in holding the Appellate Panel's denial of Employer's motion to dismiss was\r\nimmediately appealable. Id. at 188, 714 S.E.2d at 549. The court also clarified\r\nthat the issue is properly couched as one of appellate jurisdiction rather than\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Id.\r\n\r\nIn an unpublished North Carolina case, the deputy commissioner (similar to our\r\nsingle commissioner) entered an order denying a claimant's motion to dismiss the\r\nguaranty association's request for a final hearing. Pait v. Se. Reg'l Hosp., 675\r\nS.E.2d 154 (N.C. Ct. App. 2009). The claimant filed a notice of appeal to the Full\r\nCommission (similar to our Appellate Panel). Id. The Guaranty Association filed\r\na motion to dismiss the claimant's appeal. Id. The Full Commission denied the\r\nclaimant's request to be allowed to take an interlocutory appeal from the deputy\r\ncommissioner's order, finding the right to appeal the interlocutory order was\r\npreserved until the issuance of a final opinion and award by a deputy\r\ncommissioner, at which time the claimant could raise any issues on appeal to the\r\nFull Commission. Id. \"An order declining to allow an interlocutory appeal to the\r\n[F]ull Commission from an order entered by a [d]eputy [c]ommissioner denying a\r\ndismissal motion is quintessentially interlocutory, since it contemplate[s] further\r\n\nproceedings . . . at the trial level.\" Id. (fourth and fifth alteration by court) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn a New York case, \"a Workers' Compensation Law Judge [(WCLJ)] found that\r\nclaimant had submitted prima facie medical evidence of an injury and set the claim\r\ndown for a hearing to determine, among other things, the question of causal\r\nrelationship.\" Garti v. Salvation Army, 914 N.Y.S.2d 799, 800 (N.Y. App. Div.\r\n2011).        The employer sought review from the Workers'\r\n              Compensation Board, arguing that claimant had not\r\n              submitted prima facie medical evidence. The Board\r\n              refused to consider the employer's application, pointing\r\n              out that a finding of prima facie medical evidence after a\r\n              prehearing conference \"is an evidentiary determination\r\n              that the case may proceed and is interlocutory and is not\r\n              reviewable by the Board.\"\r\n\r\nId. (citation omitted). The employer appealed to the Supreme Court, Appellate\r\nDivision; the claimant asserted the appeal was from an interlocutory decision and\r\nmust be dismissed; and the court agreed with the claimant. Id.\r\n\r\nIn another New York case, the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, noted:\r\n\r\n              The Board made no final rulings and declined review of\r\n              the WCLJ's decision based upon 12 NYCRR\r\n              300.38[(h)(5)](i), which provides that WCLJ \"[d]ecisions\r\n              containing only orders or directions made . . . in\r\n              connection with the pre-hearing conference and\r\n              expedited hearing process in controverted cases . . . shall\r\n              not be reviewable by the Board . . . until a decision has\r\n              been made by a [WCLJ] establishing or disallowing the\r\n              claim.\"\r\n\r\nGibbs v. N.Y. City Health & Hosp. Corp., 980 N.Y.S.2d 172, 173 (N.Y. App. Div.\r\n2014) (second alteration, ellipses, and emphasis added by court).\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court has held, \"If an appealing party has no right of\r\nappeal, an appellate court on its own motion should dismiss the appeal even though\r\n\nthe question of appealability has not been raised by the parties themselves.\" Love\r\nv. Moore, 291 S.E.2d 141, 144 (N.C. 1982). The supreme court found, \"The\r\nthreshold question which should have been considered by the [c]ourt of [a]ppeals,\r\nalthough not presented to that court, was whether an immediate appeal lies from\r\nthe trial court's orders.\" Id. The supreme court determined \"the appeal was\r\npremature and the case should first run its course in the trial court.\" Id. It\r\ntherefore, \"neither consider[ed] nor address[ed] the questions discussed by the\r\n[c]ourt of [a]ppeals.\" Id. The court noted, \"Any procedural matters about the\r\nissues which defendant attempted to raise in this purported appeal may later be\r\nconsidered on appeal of this cause in its entirety should the matter again be brought\r\nbefore the appellate division.\" Id. at 147. The court vacated the court of appeals'\r\ndecision and remanded the case to it with instructions to enter an order dismissing\r\nthe appeal. Id.\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Supreme Court has found a district court did not have jurisdiction to\r\nhear a petition for judicial review from the Real Estate Appraiser Board's decision\r\nto deny a motion to dismiss. Williams v. State, Bd. of Real Estate Appraisers, 239\r\nP.3d 780, 782, 784 (Idaho 2010). The supreme court thus vacated the district\r\ncourt's decision. Id. at 784. The court additionally determined it did \"not have\r\njurisdiction to decide the issues raised and must dismiss this appeal.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe appeal from the single commissioner to the Appellate Panel was not from a\r\nfinal judgment and was interlocutory. The applicable statute provides for appeals\r\nfrom an award, which Black's Law defines as a final decision, mandating that\r\nappeals only be from a final decision. Although the applicable regulation uses the\r\nterm decision instead of award, a regulation cannot add to the statute. Therefore,\r\nan appeal must be from an award, not simply any decision.\r\n\r\nThe New York cases of Garti and Gibbs support that appeals from the single\r\ncommissioner must be from final order, but New York's statute is more specific\r\nthan our state's, stating explicitly decisions containing only orders or directions\r\nmade shall not be reviewable by the Appellate Panel until a decision has been\r\nmade establishing or disallowing the claim. In the case of Pait from North\r\nCarolina, after which our workers' compensation system was originally modeled,\r\nthe court affirmed the Appellate Panel's dismissal of the appeal from the single\r\ncommissioner for the order being interlocutory until the single commissioner\r\nissues a final opinion and award. Our supreme court has made clear in recent years\r\nwith Bone that the circuit court (under the former statute), this court, and the\r\nsupreme court cannot hear appeals from the Appellate Panel if it does not\r\n\nconstitute a final decision. A plain reading of the statute supports that appeals\r\nfrom the single commissioner to the Appellate Panel must be from final orders as\r\nwell. The denial of a motion to dismiss has been consistently held not to be a final\r\ndecision. That principle should also apply in the workers' compensation context.4\r\nAccordingly, we vacate the Appellate Panel's order and remand this matter to it for\r\nit to enter an order vacating Employer's appeal to it.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe reverse the Appellate Panel's order because the order from the single\r\ncommissioner was not immediately appealable.5 Accordingly, we vacate the\r\nAppellate Panel's order and remand for it to dismiss Employer's appeal.\r\n\r\nVACATED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 In terms of appealability, the denial of a motion to dismiss is much like a denial\r\nof a motion for summary judgment. See McLendon, 313 S.C. at 526 n.2, 443\r\nS.E.2d at 540 n.2. Accordingly, the single commissioner's order does not establish\r\nthe law of the case and can be appealed from if an award is issued.

Simons, all of Columbia, for\r\n            Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Clifford Thompson appeals the circuit court's order dismissing his\r\ndeclaratory judgment action. In that action, he sought a declaration that his\r\nkidnapping convictions did not include a criminal sexual offense and would not\r\nrequire him to register as a sex offender. Thompson argues the circuit court erred\r\n\nin ruling (1) no justiciable controversy existed;1 (2) it did not have subject matter\r\njurisdiction to change Thompson's prison classification based on Al-Shabazz v.\r\nState, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (1999); and (3) Thompson's claims were moot.\r\nWe affirm.2\r\n\r\nThompson pled guilty to four kidnapping and six armed robbery offenses in 2001,\r\nand the court sentenced him to twenty-five years in prison. At that time, a person\r\nconvicted of kidnapping was required to register as a sex offender when released\r\nfrom prison \"except when the court makes a finding . . . the offense did not include\r\na criminal sexual offense.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(C)(15) (Supp. 2000); see\r\nalso S.C. Code Ann. §§ 23-3-430(A), -440(1) (Supp. 2000). The sentencing court\r\ndid not determine whether any of the kidnappings included a criminal sexual\r\noffense. Thompson appealed, and this court affirmed all of his convictions except\r\none kidnapping and one armed robbery. State v. Thompson, Op. No. 2003-UP-252\r\n(S.C.Ct.App. filed Apr. 3, 2003).\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Thompson filed this action. We find the circuit court properly determined\r\nno justiciable controversy existed and dismissed the action because the question of\r\nwhether Thompson should be required to register as a sex offender is not ripe for\r\nadjudication. See Pee Dee Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 279\r\nS.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983) (\"Before a court may render a declaratory\r\njudgment, an actual, justiciable controversy must exist. A justiciable controversy\r\nis a real and substantial controversy [that] is ripe and appropriate for judicial\r\ndetermination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract\r\ndispute.\"). This case does not present a justiciable controversy because the current\r\nstatutes requiring registration do not contemplate that Thompson will register until\r\nhe is released from prison.3 See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(A) (2007) (\"Any\r\n\r\n1 Thompson presented this issue as two separate issues, but we believe combining\r\nthem into one enables us to more accurately address the point he raises.\r\n2   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n3 Thompson's projected release date is August 5, 2020, and he is not currently\r\nregistered on the sex offender registry.

Moreover, \"the applicable statute\r\n[for determining whether a person must register] is the statute that exist[s] at the\r\ntime of [that person's] release from prison,\" and thus it is unknown whether\r\nThompson will be required to register. Hazel v. State, 377 S.C. 60, 64, 659 S.E.2d\r\n137, 139 (2008).4 Because the law does not require Thompson to register as a sex\r\noffender until he is released from prison, and because the sex offender registry\r\nstatute may be amended between now and Thompson's release, we find the circuit\r\ncourt properly dismissed Thompson's action. Therefore, we do not reach the\r\nmerits of Thompson's claim.\r\n\r\nThompson's claim will become ripe for adjudication when he is released from\r\nprison, if he is then required by law to register. The plaintiff in Hazel was\r\nconvicted of kidnapping in 1979 and released from prison on parole in 2002. 377\r\nS.C. at 62, 659 S.E.2d at 138. \"Upon release, he was informed that he would be\r\n\r\nwebsite indicating Thompson is to be included in the sex offender registry, the\r\nDepartment of Corrections recently updated its website, and the website no longer\r\nindicates Thompson will be required to register.

Incarcerated Inmate Search, http://public.doc.state.sc.us/scdc-\r\npublic/inmateDetails.do?id= 00274805 (last visited Jun. 30, 2014).\r\n4 The sex offender registry statutes have been amended many times since their\r\nenactment. See § 23-3-430(C) (enacted by Act No. 497, § 112A, 1994 S.C. Acts\r\n5794-98; amended by Act No. 444, § 16, 1996 S.C. Acts 2684-90; Act No. 384,\r\n§ 1, 1998 S.C. Acts 2302-2311; Act No. 74, § 1, 1999 S.C. Acts 244-45; Act No.\r\n363, § 2, 2000 S.C. Acts 2444; Act No. 208, § 14, 2004 S.C. Acts 1930-31; Act\r\nNo. 141, § 2, 2005 S.C.

Many of the amendments have related to the status of kidnapping as a\r\nregistration-triggering offense. See Hazel, 377 S.C. at 63-64, 659 S.E.2d at 139\r\n(analyzing amendments to the sex offender registry statutes and noting kidnapping\r\nhas been deleted from and added to the list of offenses that require registration).\r\n\nrequired to register on the Sex Offender Registry.\" Id. He later filed an action in\r\ncircuit court claiming he should not be required to register. Id. \"The court granted\r\n[Hazel]'s motion for declaratory judgment and found that [he] is not required to\r\nregister as a sex offender.\" 377 S.C. at 63, 659 S.E.2d at 138. The supreme court\r\nheld the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear the dispute and affirmed. 377 S.C. at\r\n65, 659 S.E.2d at 140. Under Hazel, therefore, if Thompson is required upon\r\nrelease from prison to register as a sex offender, he may file a declaratory\r\njudgment action at that time to litigate the propriety of the requirement.5\r\n\r\nAs to Thompson's other issues on appeal, the circuit court properly determined any\r\nissue relating to Thompson's classification as a sex offender by the Department of\r\nCorrections must first be addressed through administrative proceedings. See Al-\r\nShabazz, 338 S.C. at 375-78, 527 S.E.2d at 753-55 (noting an inmate must initiate\r\na grievance within the Department of Corrections to challenge his custody status,\r\nand holding an inmate can seek judicial review only after the administrative law\r\ncourt has issued a final decision). Thompson also argues the circuit court erred in\r\nfinding his claims were moot. We do not address this issue because the circuit\r\ncourt did not make such a finding in its order.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting: The majority maintains the circuit court correctly\r\ndismissed this action because no justiciable controversy existed and any issue\r\nrelating to Thompson's classification as a sex offender by the Department of\r\nCorrections must be addressed through administrative proceedings. I respectfully\r\ndissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 We recognize the sex offender registry, specifically section 23-3-430(C)(15), did\r\nnot exist when Hazel pled guilty in 1979. Therefore, the sentencing court in Hazel,\r\nunlike here, did not have the opportunity to determine whether the kidnapping\r\nincluded a criminal sexual offense. The difference is not significant, however,\r\nbecause in both cases the only version of the statute applicable to the requirement\r\nfor registration is the one in effect on the date of release. See Hazel, 377 S.C. at\r\n64, 659 S.E.2d at 139 (holding \"[s]ection 23-3-430[(C)(15)] had no effect . . . until\r\n[the person] was released from prison\").\r\n\nInitially, I disagree with the majority's position that Thompson failed to present a\r\nripe issue because no justiciable controversy existed at the circuit court. \"Before\r\nany action can be maintained, there must exist a justiciable controversy.\" Byrd v.\r\nIrmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 430, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996). \"A justiciable\r\ncontroversy is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial\r\ndetermination, as distinguished from a dispute or difference of a contingent,\r\nhypothetical or abstract character.\" Id. at 430-31, 468 S.E.2d at 864. Specifically,\r\nthe majority maintains this case does not present a justiciable controversy because\r\nthe substance of the statute requiring registration is unknown until an inmate is\r\nreleased from incarceration. In my view, the controversy in this case does not arise\r\nfrom whether or not Thompson must register as a sex offender, but rather whether\r\nhe should be classified as a sex offender.6 Undoubtedly, Thompson will not be\r\naffected by having to register as a sex offender until he is released from prison,\r\nsince an inmate is not required to register until their release. See Hazel, 377 S.C. at\r\n64, 659 S.E.2d at 139 (noting a defendant is not required to register as a sex\r\noffender pursuant to section 23-3-430 until the defendant is released from prison).\r\nHowever, an inmate's classification as a sex offender, which in the case of\r\nkidnapping under the current statute is the default when the circuit court fails to\r\nmake a finding regarding the sexual nature of the kidnapping, could have\r\nimmediate and harmful ramifications.7 See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430 (Supp.\r\n2013). Accordingly, I respectfully disagree with the majority and would hold the\r\ncircuit court erred in finding Thompson failed to present a justiciable controversy.\r\n\r\nI would also hold the circuit court erred in finding any issue relating to Thompson's\r\nclassification must be addressed through administrative proceedings. Generally,\r\n\r\n6 I distinguish Hazel v. State, 377 S.C. 60, 659 S.E.2d 137 (2008), from the current\r\ncase because unlike Hazel, where the supreme court faced the question of the\r\napplicable statute as to sex offender registration, the instant case deals with the\r\nimmediate ramifications of being labeled a sex offender. Hazel did not face such\r\nramifications because, as the majority notes, the sex offender registry did not exist\r\nwhen Hazel pled guilty in 1979.\r\n7 While not in the record on appeal, a simple review of the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Corrections's website reveals an individual with a \"current or past\r\nsex crime[] conviction\" is ineligible for substance abuse services and the \"90 Day\r\nPre-Release Program.\" See Division of Behavioral Health & Substance Abuse\r\nServices, S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\nhttp://www.doc.sc.gov/pubweb/programs/substance.jsp (last visited June 20,\r\n2014).\r\n\nissues regarding custodial status within the Department of Corrections are\r\nadministrative in nature and therefore are properly determined before the\r\nadministrative body. See Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 368-69, 527 S.E.2d\r\n742, 749-50 (2000). However, in my view, classification as a sex offender is not a\r\ncustodial status; therefore, the current challenge was properly brought before the\r\ncircuit court. Moreover, even if such a classification is considered a \"custodial\r\nstatus,\" at least in the case of kidnapping, that status is a direct result of the circuit\r\ncourt's finding or failure to make any finding, that the offense was a criminal\r\nsexual offense. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430 (Supp. 2013). Thus, any attempt\r\nby Thompson to challenge his status as a sex offender through the inmate\r\ngrievance process would be futile in that the Department of Corrections is bound\r\nby the effect of the circuit court's decision8 regarding whether his kidnapping\r\nconviction was sexual in nature. Based on the foregoing, I would reverse and\r\nremand because the circuit court erred in finding the instant case does not present a\r\njusticiable controversy and Thompson must institute administrative proceedings to\r\nchallenge his status as a sex offender. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 I use the term \"decision\" loosely because, as previously noted, pursuant to section\r\n23-3-430(C)(15), the circuit court's failure to make a sex offender determination in\r\nthe kidnapping context results in the defendant's designation as a sex offender.\r\n9 While the majority does not reach the mootness issue, based on the record, I\r\nwould hold this case is not moot. The majority cites a recent update to the\r\nDepartment of Corrections's website; however, this update is not evidence in the\r\nrecord on appeal. Rather, there is no evidence in the record indicating Thompson\r\nis no longer considered a sex offender, and therefore that \"a judgment rendered by\r\nthe court [would] have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy.\"\r\nSloan v.

We reverse and remand.1\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAllegro is a professional employer organization (PEO) that was formed in the late\r\n1990s by its initial owner, Mary Etta McCarthy. A PEO provides human resource\r\nservices for companies wanting to outsource that function. Scully joined Allegro\r\nin August of 1998 as president and a member of its board of directors. He was also\r\ngiven thirty percent of Allegro's stock. The remaining directors consisted of\r\nMcCarthy, who was the majority owner, and one of Allegro's clients, Frank\r\nBrown. Between 1998 and 2001, Scully's ownership interest in Allegro increased\r\nto forty-nine percent and McCarthy held the remaining fifty-one percent interest.\r\n\r\nAllegro and Scully never executed an employment contract or non-compete\r\nagreement. Furthermore, Allegro did not have an employee handbook that was\r\nissued to or utilized by its employees. However, when Scully joined Allegro,\r\nScully and McCarthy negotiated a Partnership/Buy-Sell Agreement that governed\r\nthe percentage and change in ownership of Allegro.2\r\n\r\nMcCarthy was actively involved in Allegro's management until Scully joined and\r\ntook over the day-to-day operations. Scully testified that as president, he was\r\nentrusted with managing the operations in the best interest of Allegro along with\r\nfinancial oversight of the company. Beginning in late 2002 or early 2003, Scully\r\nexpressed frustrations about the business to his friend, Corbin, who was also a\r\ncertified public accountant (CPA). Additionally, Corbin's company, Merritt, was a\r\nclient of Allegro. Corbin advised Scully regarding three possible options: (1)\r\nScully could buy out McCarthy; (2) McCarthy could buy out Scully; or (3) Scully\r\ncould start his own business. Scully then consulted with Corbin about how to\r\nmake an offer to purchase McCarthy's interest in Allegro. In March of 2003,\r\n\r\n1 This case was previously decided by this court; our supreme court remanded it for \n\r\na decision on the issues involving the directed verdict and JNOV motions. Allegro, \n\r\nInc. v. Scully, 400 S.C. 33, 733 S.E.2d 114 (2012) remanded by Op. 27391 (S.C. \n\r\nSup.Ct. filed May 28, 2014) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 21 at 29). \n\r\n2 Brown was not a party to this agreement. \n\r\n\nCorbin issued a letter to Scully outlining three approaches for determining a fair\r\npurchase price for McCarthy's shares in Allegro. In concluding the letter, Corbin\r\nstated:     The overall issue here is that something needs to happen.\r\n            The ongoing tension between you and Mary Etta is\r\n            obvious. That has to be tiring for both of you. It is also\r\n            probably obvious to employees. Either way, it is not\r\n            healthy for the business. The business has a better\r\n            chance of success without that tension. If one of you has\r\n            to sell out to relieve it, then that is what needs to happen.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2003, Scully informed McCarthy that he wanted to purchase her\r\nownership interest in Allegro. Scully also discussed his proposal with Allegro's\r\nthird director, Brown. During his conversation with Brown, Scully stated that if he\r\ncould not purchase McCarthy's shares, he would set up his own PEO business.\r\nOver the course of a series of discussions with McCarthy in 2003, Scully told her\r\nthat if they could not agree upon a price at which she would sell her ownership\r\ninterest in Allegro, he would leave the company and form a competing company,\r\ntaking employees and clients with him. In response to these conversations,\r\nMcCarthy suggested having Allegro valued to determine the price of her interest.\r\nAfter McCarthy hired the Geneva Corporation (Geneva) to conduct a valuation\r\nstudy, Corbin reviewed the study and provided feedback to Scully at Scully's\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nOn December 24, 2003, McCarthy received a letter from Scully offering to\r\npurchase her shares, setting forth two options as to the purchase price, and asking\r\nfor her response by January 23, 2004. Prior to sending McCarthy the offer, Scully\r\nhad asked Corbin to review it and Corbin advised that it was a fair offer.\r\nMcCarthy received a subsequent letter from Scully on January 23, 2004, restating\r\nhis offer. On January 29, 2004, McCarthy responded with a written counteroffer.\r\nScully replied in a February 2, 2004 letter, stating, \"if we are unable to come to\r\nterms the result is a lose, lose, lose for everyone involved. If I leave Allegro and\r\nstart a new PEO we will be in competition for the same customers and employees.\"\r\n\r\nHaving failed to reach an agreement regarding the purchase of Allegro, Scully\r\ngave his letter of resignation to McCarthy on February 16, 2004. McCarthy then\r\ntold Scully she would accept his last offer to purchase her ownership interest in\r\nAllegro. They agreed her lawyers would draw up the necessary paperwork by the\r\nend of that week. After that conversation, Scully left town on a business trip for\r\n\nAllegro. While Scully was out of town, McCarthy decided she did not want to sell\r\nher ownership interest after all and focused her efforts on retaining Allegro.\r\nDuring Scully's absence, McCarthy met with Jim Everly, whom she hired to\r\nreplace Scully as Allegro's president. McCarthy met with Scully on February 23,\r\n2004, and presented Scully with a letter accepting his resignation. Immediately\r\nfollowing Scully's departure from the company, McCarthy and Everly held a\r\nmeeting with all Allegro employees and informed the employees that they must\r\nsign non-compete contracts. Yarborough was an employee of Allegro from 2000\r\nuntil 2004. At the meeting with McCarthy and Everly, Yarborough and another\r\nemployee, Lisa Milliken, refused to sign the non-compete contracts.\r\n\r\nMcCarthy and Everly contacted all of Allegro's clients to inform them Scully was\r\nno longer employed by Allegro and made arrangements to meet with each client.\r\nThey first met with Corbin of Merritt, who told them that due to his personal\r\nfriendship with Scully, Merritt's business would likely move to Scully's new\r\ncompany, Synergetic. Pursuant to Merritt's contract with Allegro, Corbin sent a\r\nthirty day notice in the form of a letter on February 27, 2004, announcing its\r\ntermination of their contract as of March 31, 2004. Letters from other clients\r\nterminating their contracts with Allegro shortly followed.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure from Allegro, Scully formed his new company, Synergetic. On\r\nMarch 1, 2004, Yarborough resigned as an employee of Allegro and began\r\nworking for Synergetic on March 2, 2004. Millikin also resigned from her position\r\nwith Allegro on March 1, 2004, and subsequently became an employee of\r\nSynergetic.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 2004, Allegro initiated this action by filing a complaint against\r\nScully, Yarborough, Corbin, and Synergetic. On that same date, Allegro filed a\r\nmotion for a temporary injunction, seeking to enjoin Scully, Yarborough, and\r\nSynergetic from soliciting business from Allegro's clients. That motion was\r\ngranted in an eleven page order after a hearing on October 14, 2004.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Allegro's case, as well as at the close of all evidence, both sides\r\nmoved for directed verdicts. These motions were denied. The trial court then\r\nsubmitted to the jury eleven of the claims asserted by Allegro.3 Nine of the claims\r\n\r\n\r\n3Allegro acknowledges no claims against Synergetic were submitted to the jury;\r\nSynergetic joins this appeal because the issue was not addressed in the trial court's\r\norders denying the Appellants' post-trial motions.\r\n\napplied to Scully alone,4 one claim applied to Yarborough alone,5 and one claim\r\napplied jointly to Scully, Yarborough, and Corbin.6 The jury's special verdict form\r\nlisted each of the eleven causes of action and asked two questions for each charge:\r\n(1) whether the plaintiff had proven that claim; and (2) if the claim had been\r\nproven, the amount of actual damages and punitive damages (where appropriate)\r\nthe jury awarded as to each claim.\r\n\r\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent a question to the trial court asking whether they\r\nshould list the damages specific to each cause of action individually, or place the\r\noverall total amount the jury decided to award. In discussing the verdict with the\r\nforeperson, using apples as the hypothetical award, the trial court stated, \"You give\r\na certain number of apples for each cause of action. And that's all you are worried\r\nabout. And there are some law related matters that I will take care of as a Judge . .\r\n. .\" The foreperson stated she understood the concept, and the trial court\r\ncontinued:   So, for each cause of action depends on the breach of\r\n             duty or [contract or] whatever you may find give a\r\n             number, assign a value that you have been -- if the\r\n             [p]laintiff's have [proven] to you by the greater weight of\r\n             preponderance of evidence they are entitled to two apples\r\n             on this one or three on that one or four on that one, that's\r\n             the way you do it and don't worry about the total.7\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Allegro on all eleven causes of action. The jury\r\nawarded actual damages in the amount of $160,000 for each of the causes of\r\naction. Furthermore, the jury awarded $75,000 in punitive damages on the breach\r\nof loyalty claim against Yarborough, and $175,000 in punitive damages on the\r\n\r\n4 Scully was the sole defendant on charges of breach of contract, breach of contract\r\nwith fraudulent intent, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty,\r\nbreach of duty of loyalty, gross negligence, violation of section 33-8-310 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code, and violation of section 33-8-420(a) of the South Carolina\r\nCode.\r\n5 Yarborough was the sole defendant on one breach of loyalty charge.\r\n6 Scully, Yarborough, and Corbin were jointly charged with civil conspiracy.\r\n7 It is unclear whether the trial court addressed the issue of the jury's verdict solely\r\nwith the foreperson, or in the presence of the entire jury. This court strongly warns\r\nthe trial bench of the danger of interacting with only the foreperson on substantive\r\nmatters.\r\n\ncivil conspiracy claim against Scully, Yarborough, and Corbin jointly. The jury's\r\nverdict form shows that an award of $1,760,000 had initially been entered in the\r\ndesignated space for actual damages for the first cause of action, but it was struck\r\nthrough and replaced with $160,000.\r\n\r\nOnce the jury verdict was announced, the foreperson was questioned as to the total\r\nnumber of \"apples\" they intended to award Allegro, and their response was\r\n$1,760,000. The court then asked \"What about punitive damages in terms of the\r\ntotal number of apples you wanted to give to [Allegro]?\" The foreperson said the\r\njury wanted to give $250,000 total to Allegro. The court finally stated, \"We can\r\nadd it up but your mathematician says it was the intent of this jury to award\r\n[Allegro] $2,010,000,\" to which the foreperson agreed. As a final review, the trial\r\ncourt said, \"Actual damage 1.7 million and the remainder of that sum is punitive\r\ndamages totaling in the amount of $2,010,000.\" Subsequently, no change was\r\nmade to the verdict form by either the jury or the judge and no change was\r\nrequested by Allegro.\r\n\r\nThe trial court completed a Form 4 order, which stated the total amount of actual\r\nand punitive damages and their grand total of $2,010,000. The Form 4 order did\r\nnot state that these amounts applied to all, or any, of the individual Appellants, but\r\nthe special verdict form was attached showing the specific damages awards.\r\nFurther, the Form 4 order gave no indication that the jury's verdict, as stated on the\r\nspecial verdict form, had been changed, altered, or modified in any way.\r\n\r\nIn their post-trial motions, Appellants moved for an election of remedies and\r\nasserted grounds for JNOV and a new trial. On July 14, 2008, the trial court\r\ndenied all of Appellants' post-trial motions.8 In denying the motion for an election\r\nof remedies, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\n               Based upon the verdict form and the conversations with\r\n               the jury before and after its verdict, I am convinced the\r\n               jury intended to award $1.76 Million Dollars in actual\r\n               damages for each cause of action, and that it intended to\r\n               award $250,000 in punitive damages on the two causes\r\n               of action. I am further convinced that the jury's\r\n               apportionment of the verdict amongst the various causes\r\n               of action does not reflect a finding that the Plaintiff\r\n               suffered only $160,000.00 in actual damages. Thus,\r\n\r\n8   Prior to this order, Appellants submitted their objections to the proposed order.\r\n\n               entering judgment for the Plaintiff in the total amount of\r\n               $1.76 Million Dollars in actual damages and $250,000.00\r\n               in punitive damages does not give rise to a double\r\n               recovery.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 2008, Appellants filed a motion to amend and/or set aside the July 14,\r\n2008 order. This motion was also denied in an order by the trial court on April 5,\r\n2010.9 The trial court stated that in its May 5, 2006 Form 4 order, it reformed the\r\njury's verdict, changing it from eleven separate actual damages awards of $160,000\r\nand two punitive damages awards of $75,000 and $175,000, which resulted in\r\ndifferent totals against different defendants, to one total verdict of $2,010,000\r\nagainst all the defendants. The trial court further stated any issue regarding this\r\n\"reformation\" of the jury's verdict not being coupled with the option of a new trial\r\nwas waived because the issue \"was not raised in Defendants' post-trial motions.\"\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n     1.

Dunes W. Residential Golf Props.,\r\nInc., 361 S.C. 117, 121, 603 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2004); see Transcontinental Gas\r\nPipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 481, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969) (\"It is\r\nwell settled that, in determining whether a temporary injunction should issue, the\r\nmerits of the case are not to be considered, except in so far as they may enable the\r\ncourt to determine whether a prima facie showing has been made. When a prima\r\nfacie showing has been made entitling plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary\r\ninjunction will be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on\r\nthe merits.\"). A temporary injunction is granted without prejudice to the rights of\r\neither party pending a hearing on the merits, and \"when other issues are brought to\r\ntrial, they are determined without reference to the temporary injunction.\" Helsel v.\r\nCity of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992) (citing\r\nAlston v. Limehouse, 60 S.C. 559, 569, 39 S.E. 188, 191 (1901) (stating \"no fact\r\ndecided upon such motion [for a temporary injunction] is concluded thereby, and\r\nwhen the other issues are brought to trial they are to be determined without\r\nreference to said orders\")). The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve\r\nthe status quo and prevent irreparable harm to the party requesting it. Powell v.\r\nImmanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219, 221, 199 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1973).\r\n\r\nIn the case at bar, the order included approximately four and a half pages of\r\n\"Findings of Fact\" by the trial court, as well as this statement by the trial court:\r\n\r\n             The Court carefully considered the pleadings, documents,\r\n             and argument of counsel at a hearing . . . and finds that\r\n             despite Defendants' denials of wrongdoing, there is\r\n             sufficient evidence to indicate that the Defendants were\r\n             engaged in the activities alleged by the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\nAfter Appellants' objection to the admission of the preliminary injunction order,\r\nthe trial court stated, \"I think subject to your earlier objection, is that fair enough,\r\nthat I've already ruled upon?\" The Appellants concurred with the trial court, and\r\nthe trial court continued, stating, \"Very well. We might go into a little more detail\r\nlater but it is over your objection.\"\r\n\nIt is hard for this court to determine an instance where admission of a preliminary\r\ninjunction order into the trial record would not be highly prejudicial. While\r\nAppellants did not state specific grounds for their objection, we find the\r\nintroduction of the order for temporary injunction into evidence was inherently\r\nprejudicial, and thus, the grounds for the objection were patent. See Dunn, 311\r\nS.C. at 43-47, 426 S.E.2d at 757-58. We believe admitting this order had a high\r\npossibility of influencing the jury due to its numerous findings of fact and\r\nstatements concluding defendants' liability for the alleged charges. The trial court\r\nabused its discretion in admitting the order into evidence. Thus, we reverse and\r\nremand in accordance with this decision.\r\n\r\n2. McHenry's Expert Report\r\n\r\nAppellants argue McHenry's written report and its attachments were cumulative of\r\nhis subsequent testimony and contained impermissible and highly prejudicial\r\nhearsay, making its admission into evidence reversible error. We agree to the\r\nextent that the written report included the preliminary injunction order, but find the\r\nremainder of the testimony did not prejudice Appellants.\r\n\r\n\"Rule 703, SCRE, allows an expert giving an opinion to rely on facts or data that\r\nare not admitted in evidence or even admissible into evidence.\" Wright v. Hiester\r\nConstr. Co., 389 S.C. 504, 523, 698 S.E.2d 822, 832 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing Jones\r\nv. Doe, 372 S.C. 53, 62, 640 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct. App. 2006)). However, Rule\r\n703 does not allow the admission of hearsay evidence simply because an expert\r\nused it in forming his opinion; the rule only provides the expert can give an\r\nopinion based on facts or data that were not admitted into evidence. Jones, 372\r\nS.C. at 62-63, 640 S.E.2d at 519.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, for an objection to be preserved for appellate review, the\r\nobjection must be made at the time the evidence is presented. State v. Simpson,\r\n325 S.C. 37, 42, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996). Further, it must be made with sufficient\r\nspecificity \"to inform the trial court of the point being urged by the objector.\"\r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).\r\n\r\nAt trial, Appellants objected to McHenry's report after Allegro moved to put it into\r\nevidence. The Appellants stated, \"Same objection,\" purportedly in reference to a\r\nprevious objection on the record that was based on matters discussed in camera.\r\nWhile the in camera discussion was either not placed on the record or not given to\r\nus in the record on appeal, the trial court's 2008 order states,\r\n\n             I overruled this general objection which was insufficient\r\n             as a matter of law to present any objection, upon the\r\n             ground that experts are permitted to base their opinion on\r\n             hearsay if it is the type generally relied upon by experts.\r\n             The Defendants never objected that the hearsay, to the\r\n             extent there was any, was not this permissible type of\r\n             hearsay.\r\n\r\nIn light of the trial court's 2008 order, it is apparent the objection was a general\r\nhearsay objection. In their 2006 post-trial motion, the Appellants objected again to\r\nthe admission of McHenry's report \"because this report was cumulative of his\r\ntestimony, contained impermissible hearsay, and contained matters that were\r\nirrelevant and which served only to unfairly prejudice Defendants, confuse the\r\nissues, and mislead the jury.\" They further stated the report contained a document\r\nthat gave \"a purported timeline replete with multiple layers of impermissible\r\nhearsay, self-serving statements, conclusions of fact and law, Plaintiff's own\r\nopinions, and references to impermissible damages such as Plaintiff's litigation\r\ncosts and attorneys' fees in this action.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe the specific issue of impermissible hearsay in the expert's report is\r\npreserved for appellate review, as the issue was raised with sufficient specificity,\r\nand ruled upon by the trial court. See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp.\r\nof S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (holding that to be\r\npreserved for appellate review, an issue must have been (1) raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial court, (2) raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a timely manner,\r\nand (4) raised to the trial court with sufficient specificity). There is nothing in the\r\nrecord on appeal that indicates the trial objection included arguments that the\r\nreport was cumulative and contained matters that were irrelevant; thus, we find\r\nthose issues are not preserved for our review. See McCall v. IKON, 380 S.C. 649,\r\n663, 670 S.E.2d 695, 703 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding that the appellant has the\r\nburden of providing a record sufficient for appellate review).\r\n\r\nHere, McHenry was allowed to rely on hearsay in his report when giving his expert\r\nopinion. However, the admission of the report itself simply because McHenry\r\nused it in forming his expert opinion was in error. The report contained many\r\ninstances of hearsay, including numerous statements by Scully. However, \"the\r\nadmission in evidence of inadmissible hearsay affords no basis for reversal where\r\nthe out-of-court declarant later testifies at trial and is available for cross-\r\nexamination.\" Clark v. Ross, 284 S.C. 543, 551, 328 S.E.2d 91, 97 (Ct. App.\r\n\n1985), abrogated by Sherer v. James, 290 S.C. 404, 351 S.E.2d 148 (1986).\r\nFurther, we do not find any of the remaining impermissible hearsay to be\r\nreversible error.\r\n\r\nWe address the fact that a copy of the temporary injunction order was attached to\r\nthe report, which we find highly prejudicial to the Appellants. We found\r\nadmission of the temporary injunction order was improper, and it was error to\r\nadmit it with the expert's report as well. We find that portion of the expert's report\r\nto be highly prejudicial; thus, we reverse the decision of the trial court to the extent\r\nit allowed the temporary injunction order into the record.\r\n\r\n3. Exclusion of Damages Evidence and McHenry's Qualification\r\n\r\nBecause we reverse and remand based upon the above evidentiary issues, we need\r\nnot reach Appellants' remaining evidentiary arguments regarding the trial court's\r\nexclusion of damages evidence and McHenry's qualification as an expert. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\nits determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\nII. Denial of Directed Verdict and JNOV\r\n\r\n\"In ruling on motions for directed verdict or [JNOV], the trial court is required to\r\nview the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the\r\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motions.\" Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nLabor, Licensing & Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). \"'In\r\ndeciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is\r\nconcerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence.\"' Pond Place\r\nPartners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n(quoting Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861 (Ct. App. 2001)).\r\n\"When considering directed verdict and JNOV motions, neither the trial court nor\r\nthe appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts\r\nin the testimony or evidence.\" Id. This court will reverse the trial court's ruling on\r\na directed verdict or JNOV motion only where there is no evidence to support the\r\nruling or where the ruling is controlled by an error of law.\" Clark v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nPublic Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005); Hinkle v. Nat'l\r\nCas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003)).\r\n\r\nFor preservation purposes, when a defendant moves for a directed verdict under\r\nRule 50, SCRCP at the close of the plaintiff's case, he must renew that motion at\r\n\nthe close of all evidence. Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 19, 640 S.E.2d 486, 496 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006) (citing Hendrix v. E. Distribution, Inc., 316 S.C. 34, 37, 446 S.E.2d\r\n440, 442 (Ct. App. 1994), aff'd in result, 320 S.C. 218, 464 S.E.2d 112 (1995)).\r\n\"[If] a party fails to renew a motion for a directed verdict at the close of all\r\nevidence, he waives his right to move for JNOV.\" Id. A motion for JNOV under\r\nRule 50(b), SCRCP is a renewal of a directed verdict motion and cannot raise\r\ngrounds beyond those raised in the directed verdict. Chapman v. Upstate RV &\r\nMarine, 364 S.C. 82, 88, 610 S.E.2d 852, 856 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\n1. Civil Conspiracy\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the trial court should have granted their directed verdict and\r\nJNOV motions on the civil conspiracy claim because there were no special\r\ndamages, and, as to appellant Corbin, because there was no evidence of an intent to\r\nharm Allegro. We find part of this argument was not preserved for our review, and\r\nwe disagree with the remainder of Appellants' argument.\r\n\r\na. Special Damages\r\n\r\nFirst, we review Appellants' argument that there was no evidence of special\r\ndamages and, thus, the trial court erred in denying their directed verdict and JNOV\r\nmotions. At the close of Allegro's evidence, Appellants moved for their directed\r\nverdict and stated:\r\n\r\n             With regard to the civil conspiracy cause of action\r\n             against Ms. Yarborough and Mr. Corbin, as Your\r\n             Honor's well aware, you have to show a combination of\r\n             two or more people for the purpose of harming, in this\r\n             case Allegro, and that there has to be some special\r\n             damages, not just, the normal damages that are incident\r\n             to other claims but special damages unique to that\r\n             conspiracy and the Plaintiff has offered no evidence of\r\n             any special damages other than the general damages that\r\n             their expert testified to yesterday. So because of that\r\n             absence we would submit the civil conspiracy claim\r\n             should be dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn Appellants' directed verdict motion at the close of all evidence, they failed to\r\nrenew their previous directed verdict motion and also failed to argue that there was\r\n\na lack of evidence as to special damages. Thus, we find Appellants did not\r\npreserve this portion of their argument. See Wright, 372 S.C. at 19, 640 S.E.2d at\r\n496.\r\n\r\nb. Intent to Harm\r\n\r\nIn contrast to their argument discussed above, Appellants did specifically renew\r\ntheir contention that Corbin did not have the requisite intent to harm, which is a\r\nrequirement to be found liable for civil conspiracy. We determine that this portion\r\nof the argument is preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n\"'A civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons joining for the\r\npurpose of injuring and causing special damage to the plaintiff.'\" Cricket Cove\r\nVentures, LLC v. Gilland, 390 S.C. 312, 324, 701 S.E.2d 39, 46 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(quoting McMillan v. Oconee Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d\r\n884, 886 (2006)); see also Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 208, 387 S.E.2d 91, 95\r\n(Ct. App. 1989) (\"Civil conspiracy consists of three elements: (1) a combination of\r\ntwo or more persons, (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes\r\nhim special damage.\"). \"'In order to establish a conspiracy, evidence, either direct\r\nor circumstantial, must be produced from which a party may reasonably infer the\r\njoint assent of the minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the unlawful\r\nenterprise.'\" Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 49, 619 S.E.2d 437, 453 (Ct. App.\r\n2005) (quoting First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 575, 511\r\nS.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct. App. 1998)). The gravamen of the tort of civil conspiracy is\r\n\"the damage resulting to [the] plaintiff from an overt act done pursuant to a\r\ncommon design.\" Vaught, 300 S.C. at 208, 387 S.E.2d at 95.\r\n\r\nHere, Corbin admitted he had a general knowledge about Allegro's clients because\r\nhe previously did accounting work for the company. Corbin also admitted he\r\nspoke in an advisory capacity with Scully about Scully's interest in Allegro without\r\ninforming McCarthy of the conversations. In this advisory capacity, Corbin stated\r\nhe outlined the option of setting up a competitive company and explained there\r\nwas a letter that outlined that option along with other options. Specifically, Corbin\r\nagreed he was \"intimately\" involved in all conversation regarding Scully's interest\r\nin buying Allegro or setting up his own competing business. The credibility of\r\nstatements evidencing Corbin only had the intent to help and not injure Allegro are\r\nfor a jury to decide. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\r\nmoving party, Allegro, we find evidence exists to go before a jury to weigh. For\r\nthe foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's denial of Appellants' directed\r\nverdict on this ground.\r\n\n2. Contract Claims\r\n\r\nScully argues the trial court erred by failing to grant his directed verdict and JNOV\r\nas to the claims for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by a\r\nfraudulent act. Specifically, Scully contends there was no evidence of any contract\r\nbetween Allegro and Scully, no evidence of any terms of the alleged contract, and\r\nno evidence of a breach of the alleged contract. We find a portion of Scully's\r\nargument was not preserved for our review, and we disagree with the remaining\r\nargument.\r\n\r\na. Breach of Contract\r\n\r\nWe find Scully preserved the issue of the existence of a contract for our review.\r\nHowever, we do not think he preserved the argument that the terms of the contract\r\nwere not proven. See Austin v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 60, 691\r\nS.E.2d 135, 155 (2010) (holding when an issue is not raised as a ground for a\r\ndirected verdict, raising the issue in a JNOV motion will not preserve it for\r\nappellate review); see also In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92-93, 551 S.E.2d 235,\r\n238 (2001) (stating only issues raised at directed verdict can properly be raised in a\r\nJNOV).\r\n\r\nAt the close of Allegro's case, Scully made the motion for a directed verdict on the\r\nclaims of breach of contract and breach of contract with fraudulent intent and\r\nargued there was no contract between Scully and Allegro, oral or written.\r\nSpecifically, Scully argued:\r\n\r\n             The Court: You don't think there was an oral \n\r\n             understanding between these two parties in this litigation, \n\r\n             between Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Scully? \n\r\n             [Scully's Counsel]: There's been no evidence that there's \n\r\n             been any oral understanding between. \n\r\n             The Court: So, are you saying there is no written \n\r\n             contract? There is no oral contract? \n\r\n             [Scully's Counsel]: Exactly . . . . \n\r\n\r\nAt the close of all the evidence, Scully made a motion for a directed verdict,\r\narguing again that there is no evidence of any contract, oral or written, and so the\r\nclaims for breach of contract and breach of contract with fraudulent intent could\r\n\nnot stand. In his post-trial JNOV motion, Scully stated, \"[Allegro] failed to prove\r\nthe existence of a contract between Scully and [Allegro], the terms of any such\r\ncontract between Scully and Plaintiff, and the breach of any such contract by\r\nScully.\"\r\n\r\nWe hold Scully preserved the issue of the existence of a contract, but he did not\r\npreserve the issue of defining the terms of the alleged contract. See Stokes-Craven,\r\n387 S.C. at 60, 691 S.E.2d at 155.\r\n\r\n\"Under the common law, a trial court should submit to the jury the issue of\r\nexistence of a contract when its existence is questioned and the evidence is either\r\nconflicting or admits of more than one inference.\" Small v. Springs Indus., Inc.,\r\n292 S.C. 481, 483, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454 (1987); Capital City Garage & Tire Co. v.\r\nElec. Storage Battery Co., 113 S.C. 352, 101 S.E. 838 (1920); Benya v. Gamble,\r\n282 S.C. 624, 627-29, 321 S.E.2d 57, 59-61 (Ct. App. 1984). General contract law\r\nprovides that a \"'contract exists when there is an agreement between two or more\r\npersons upon sufficient consideration either to do or not to do a particular act.'\"\r\nCarolina Amusement Co. v. Conn. Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 215, 220, 437\r\nS.E.2d 122, 125 (Ct. App. 1993) (quoting Benya, 282 S.C. at 628, 321 S.E.2d at\r\n60). A contract may arise from oral or written words or by conduct. Rushing v.\r\nMcKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 290, 633 S.E.2d 917, 922 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nWe find there is evidence in the record for the jury to weigh the issue of the\r\nexistence of a contract. While there may not have been a written contract, there is\r\nevidence on the record to suggest an oral contract, or a contract created by conduct.\r\nScully was hired as President of Allegro, and he stated his general responsibilities\r\nas president of Allegro were \"[t]he daily operations of the business.\" Scully also\r\nadmitted he had financial duties as well as the responsibility to act in a good faith\r\nmanner for the benefit of the company. In addition to those admissions, the record\r\nreflects there was testimony regarding a written partnership buy/sell agreement,\r\nwhich included terms about changing ownership and percentage of ownership.\r\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to Allegro, there is evidence in the\r\nrecord for a jury to weigh whether an offer was communicated to Scully that he\r\naccepted, thus creating an employment contract. Therefore, we affirm the trial\r\ncourt on this issue.\r\n\r\nb. Breach of Contract with Fraudulent Intent\r\n\nScully's only argument on appeal regarding this issue is that the trial court erred in\r\ndenying his motion for a directed verdict and JNOV because there was no evidence\r\nof the existence of a contract. We disagree.\r\n\r\nBecause we find there was evidence for a jury to weigh in determining the\r\nexistence of a contract, we affirm the trial court on this issue.\r\n\r\n3. Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation\r\n\r\nScully argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his directed verdict and JNOV\r\nas to the claims for fraud and negligent representation. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"Fraud is an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in\r\nreliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to her or to surrender a\r\nlegal right.\" Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 672, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444\r\n(Ct. App. 2003). \"To prevail on a cause of action for fraud, a [p]laintiff must prove\r\nby clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following elements: (1) a\r\nrepresentation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity\r\nor a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be\r\nacted upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance on its\r\ntruth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's consequent and\r\nproximate injury.\" Moseley v. All Things Possible, Inc., 388 S.C. 31, 35-36, 694\r\nS.E.2d 43, 45 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 672, 582 S.E.2d at\r\n444-45).\r\n\r\nTo prove a claim for the common law tort of negligent misrepresentation, a\r\nplaintiff is required to establish the following elements: (1) the defendant made a\r\nfalse representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in\r\nmaking the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he\r\ncommunicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that\r\nduty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the\r\nrepresentation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate\r\nresult of his reliance on the representation.

Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 251, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating\r\n\"parties in a fiduciary relationship must fully disclose to each other all known\r\ninformation that is significant and material, and when this duty to disclose is\r\ntriggered, silence may constitute fraud\"). However, while our court recognizes\r\n\"[n]ondisclosure is fraudulent when there is a duty to speak,\" this discussion relates\r\nto the separate and distinct claim of fraudulent concealment, not a claim of fraud.\r\nPitts v. Jackson Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 334, 574 S.E.2d 502, 509 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002) (quoting Ardis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 517, 431 S.E.2d 267, 270 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1993)).

See id.\r\n\r\nHere, McCarthy, on behalf of Allegro, testified Scully told her of his plans.\r\nSpecifically, she stated:\r\n\r\n             [H]e told me one day and he told me this three or four\r\n             times if you do not take the money I'm offering you, I'm\r\n             leaving Allegro. I am taking Yvonne and Lisa. I am\r\n             taking 50 percent of the clients. I already know which\r\n             ones I want and it will be 50 percent of your business and\r\n             I am going to tear Allegro apart.\r\n\r\nAllegro offers no other evidence of false representations made by Scully.\r\nMcCarthy, on behalf of Allegro, admitted she knew of Scully's desire to purchase\r\nAllegro and his intent to start his own business with the possibility of damaging\r\nAllegro's business should he not be able to purchase Allegro. Thus, we reverse the\r\ntrial court on this issue, as there was no evidence to support a showing of a false\r\nrepresentation by Scully, and a failure to prove any element of fraud or\r\nmisrepresentation is fatal to the claim.\r\n\r\nIII. Remaining Arguments\r\n\nAppellants contend the trial court erred in reforming the jury's verdict when the\r\ntrial court should have either required an election of remedies based upon the jury's\r\nverdict or granted a new trial nisi additur. 10 Because we reverse the trial court on\r\nthe issues noted above, we need not review this argument.

Johnson argues the circuit court erred in (1) denying his motion to\r\nsuppress evidence stemming from a warrant he alleges was obtained without\r\nprobable cause after an illegal entry and warrantless search, and (2) ruling as a\r\nmatter of law that all of the mixture that contained methamphetamine would count\r\ntowards its weight, admitting such evidence, and ordering defense counsel not to\r\n\nargue that fact to the jury, which Johnson contends violated statutory intent and the\r\nSixth Amendment. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn February 27, 2011, an arrest warrant was issued for Brandi Quinn for malicious\r\ninjury to property. That morning, York County Sheriff's Deputy John Stagner\r\nlocated Quinn's car at the Best Way Inn in Rock Hill. Deputy Stagner kept watch\r\non Quinn's car and called for backup, after which Deputies Rachel Gladden and\r\nTony Bolin arrived at the hotel. The deputies verified with hotel management\r\nwhich room Quinn was staying in and learned that she had checked into the hotel\r\nthe previous day. Before approaching Quinn's room, Deputy Gladden informed the\r\nother deputies that there would probably be drugs in the room.1 The deputies then\r\napproached Quinn's room and knocked. Quinn did not immediately come to the\r\ndoor; instead, the deputies heard movement and whispering within the room. After\r\na few minutes, Quinn partially opened the door but remained largely concealed\r\nbehind it, which caused the deputies to worry that Quinn was concealing\r\nsomething or someone behind the door.\r\n\r\nQuinn backed further into the room and the deputies entered the room to execute\r\nthe arrest warrant. Upon entering the room, the deputies observed two persons\r\nunder the covers of the beds, possibly trying to hide. The deputies ordered the two\r\nindividuals under the bed covers to show their hands. One individual, Corey\r\nCatoe, complied with the deputies' orders and showed his hands, while the other\r\nindividual, Johnson, showed his hands twice but put them back under the covers.\r\nThe deputies testified they became increasingly concerned for their safety because\r\nof the possibility Johnson was concealing a weapon. At that point, the deputies\r\ndetained Catoe and Johnson and observed gang-related tattoos on Johnson.\r\n\r\nAfter detaining Catoe and Johnson, Deputies Bolin and Stagner performed a\r\nprotective sweep of the hotel room, which included the bathroom and under the\r\nbeds. The deputies testified the purpose of the protective sweep was to look for\r\nweapons or other individuals in the room out of concern for officer safety. During\r\nthe protective sweep of the room, Deputies Bolin and Stagner observed computer\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Deputy Gladden testified that prior to her arrival at the hotel, she received\r\ninformation from a family member of Quinn that Quinn might be under the\r\ninfluence of methamphetamine.\r\n\nequipment throughout the room, much of it disassembled.2 The deputies also\r\nobserved syringes, razor blades, a white ash substance on the floor, and aluminum\r\nfoil consistent with drug packaging. Deputy Stagner testified he observed a digital\r\nscale during the protective sweep. According to Deputy Stagner, the deputies did\r\nnot open, move, or manipulate anything during the protective sweep. Quinn's\r\narrest, the detention of Catoe and Johnson, and the protective sweep all occurred in\r\na short amount of time. Deputy Stagner testified these events happened\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nDeputy Gladden called another deputy in order to obtain a search warrant from a\r\nmagistrate, and the procured search warrant stated the following reason for\r\nsearching the hotel room:\r\n\r\n             Deputies arrested a female suspect from this room on a\r\n             warrant for malicious injury to property. While deputies\r\n             were in the room, deputies observed numerous laptop\r\n             computers and electronic equipment, two unused capped\r\n             syringes, a package of razor blades, and multiple small\r\n             tin foil packages consistent with that of drug packaging.\r\n             The female suspect taken into custody also has a prior\r\n             drug related conviction.\r\n\r\nIt took approximately one hour for the search warrant to arrive at the scene, and\r\nduring that time the deputies remained at the room but did not fully search it. After\r\nthe warrant arrived, law enforcement found a bottle containing a mixture of liquid\r\nand methamphetamine. The mixture within the bottle was being processed in the\r\n\"Shake and Bake\" method of methamphetamine production, under which some of\r\nthe materials within the bottle are strained off during the production process.\r\nInvestigator Nick Schifferle testified a reaction within the bottle had already\r\nproduced methamphetamine; however, further steps were needed to create usable\r\n\r\n2 From our reading of Deputy Bolin's testimony, these computers were\r\nimmediately visible upon the deputies' initial entrance into the room. According to\r\nDeputy Bolin, he believed the computers might be stolen, as the deputies had\r\ninformation that people were stealing computers and obtaining personal\r\ninformation from the computers' hard drives. Deputy Stagner testified the number\r\nof computers in the room was suspicious considering that Quinn had checked into\r\nthe room the previous day, and he thought the individuals may have been using\r\ncomputer parts in narcotics production.\r\n\nmethamphetamine. According to Schifferle, the mixture within the bottle was\r\ntreated as hazardous waste, as it was in an \"extremely dangerous\" state that could\r\nhave caused an explosion.\r\n\r\nJohnson was indicted for trafficking methamphetamine and the case proceeded to a\r\njury trial in York County. Initially, Johnson was tried with Catoe. Johnson joined\r\nhis co-defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search of\r\nthe hotel room, contending that the search was illegal. During the suppression\r\nhearing, the State offered testimony regarding the search warrant and the\r\nunderlying basis for the deputies' entry into the hotel room. At the end of the\r\nhearing, the circuit court ruled the evidence should not be suppressed and was\r\nadmissible, finding the protective sweep was justified to ensure the deputies'\r\nsafety. The circuit court also found the plain view exception applied to the\r\nevidence in the hotel room. Catoe entered a guilty plea amidst the suppression\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nJohnson joined Catoe's motion in limine contending that only the weight of the\r\nfinished product of methamphetamine should count towards the weight of the\r\nsubstance. During the State's case, Johnson reiterated that argument in objecting to\r\ntestimony concerning the weight of the mixture of liquid and methamphetamine\r\nand asserting the weight of the mixture should not come into evidence. The circuit\r\ncourt stated that, as it read the relevant statutes concerning methamphetamine, the\r\nlegislature intended for the weight of methamphetamine to include the weight of\r\nany material, compound, mixture, or preparation containing methamphetamine.\r\nSubsequently, the circuit court ruled that all of the mixture would count as\r\nmethamphetamine. After the circuit court's ruling, defense counsel objected on the\r\nground that the statute was overly broad and unconstitutional; this objection was\r\noverruled. Additionally, the circuit court prohibited defense counsel from making\r\nany argument to the jury that all of the mixture could not be considered\r\nmethamphetamine. The jury found Johnson guilty of trafficking methamphetamine\r\nin an amount of twenty-eight grams or more, but less than one hundred grams, and\r\nthe circuit court sentenced him to twenty-eight years' imprisonment. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nI. \t   Did the circuit court err in denying Johnson's motion to suppress evidence\r\n       stemming from a warrant he alleges was obtained without probable cause\r\n       after an illegal entry and warrantless search?\r\n\nII. \t   Did the circuit court err in ruling as a matter of law that all of the mixture\r\n        which contained methamphetamine would count towards its weight,\r\n        admitting such evidence, and ordering defense counsel not to argue that fact\r\n        to the jury?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"'In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.'\" State v.\r\nWilliams, 386 S.C. 503, 509, 690 S.E.2d 62, 65 (2010) (quoting State v. Wilson,\r\n345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)). \"The admission of evidence is within\r\nthe discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\" State v.

He maintains that even if the deputies'\r\nclaims regarding potential danger had merit, any danger was precipitated by their\r\nneedless, warrantless entry into the room. Johnson claims the circuit court erred in\r\nruling the plain view exception applied, as the deputies' initial intrusion affording\r\nthem the plain view was not lawful. Additionally, he asserts the incriminating\r\nnature of the evidence was not immediately apparent, as the deputies only observed\r\ncomputer equipment during their initial entry into the room. Johnson contends the\r\ndeputies observed the other evidence listed in the warrant after repeatedly entering\r\nand re-entering the room. Therefore, Johnson considers all of the evidence from\r\nthe hotel room to be fruit of the poisonous tree that should have been suppressed.\r\n\r\n\"When reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case, an appellate court\r\nmust affirm if there is any evidence to support the ruling.\" State v. Wright, 391\r\nS.C. 436, 442, 706 S.E.2d 324, 326 (2011). \"'The appellate court will reverse only\r\nwhen there is clear error.'\" Id. (citing State v.

However, Tindall's ensuing\r\n             discussion included a footnote explaining that this\r\n             standard of review requires a two-part analysis: (1)\r\n             whether the record supports the trial court's factual\r\n             findings and (2) whether those factual findings establish\r\n             reasonable suspicion or probable cause. See Tindall, 388\r\n             S.C. at 523 n.5, 698 S.E.2d at 206 n.5 (\"While we\r\n             acknowledge that we review under the deferential 'any\r\n             evidence' standard, this Court still must review the record\r\n             to determine if the trial judge's ultimate determination is\r\n             supported by the evidence. In short, we must ask first,\r\n             whether the record supports the trial court's assumed\r\n             findings . . . and second, whether these facts support a\r\n             finding that the officer had reasonable suspicion of a\r\n             serious crime to justify continued detention of Tindall.\"\r\n             (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nMorris, 395 S.C. at 606 n.2, 720 S.E.2d at 471 n.2 (alteration in original).\r\n\nprotection against warrantless searches, but only where, from an objective\r\nstandard, a compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant\r\nexist.\" Abdullah, 357 S.C. at 351, 592 S.E.2d at 348. A warrantless search is\r\njustified under the exigent circumstances doctrine where there is a risk of danger to\r\npolice. Id. (citing Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990)). \"In such\r\ncircumstances, a protective sweep of the premises may be permitted.\" Id. (citing\r\nMaryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 337 (1990)). \"A 'protective sweep' is a quick and\r\nlimited search of premises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety\r\nof police officers or others.\" Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 327 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the deputies approached Quinn's hotel room to execute an\r\narrest warrant. After the deputies knocked, Quinn delayed coming to the door for a\r\nfew minutes; during that time the deputies heard movement and whispering from\r\nwithin the room. Quinn eventually cracked the door open, remaining largely\r\nconcealed behind it, which caused the deputies to become concerned and uneasy\r\nabout what Quinn might have been concealing behind the door. As the deputies\r\nentered the room to arrest Quinn, they observed computers throughout the room in\r\nvarious states of disassembly. Deputies Bolin and Stagner both suspected these\r\ncomputers might have been used in illegal activity. Additionally, the deputies saw\r\nCatoe and Johnson in the room's beds under the covers, possibly hiding. After the\r\ndeputies ordered them to show their hands, Catoe complied but Johnson twice\r\nshowed his hands and put them back under the covers, which caused the deputies\r\nto worry that Johnson had a weapon. Deputy Stagner detained Johnson and\r\nobserved gang-related tattoos on him. The deputies immediately performed a\r\nprotective sweep of the room out of concern for officer safety; according to Deputy\r\nStagner these events in the hotel room all happened simultaneously. We find these\r\ncircumstances rightfully compelled the protective sweep to ensure the deputies'\r\nsafety. See State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 587, 347 S.E.2d 882, 886 (1986) (finding\r\nthat a protective sweep of a motel room was justified because it was reasonable to\r\nbelieve that concealed persons within the room might pose a danger); Abdullah,\r\n357 S.C. at 351, 592 S.E.2d at 348 (noting a protective sweep may be permitted\r\nunder the exigent circumstances doctrine where there is a risk of danger to police);\r\nid. at 352, 592 S.E.2d at 348 (holding the totality of the circumstances gave\r\nofficers reasonable grounds from an objective standard for a search of the premises\r\nwith a goal of securing the scene against perpetrators); id. at 352, 592 S.E.2d at\r\n349 (stating it was improvident to presuppose that subduing the defendant\r\nforeclosed the officers' objectively reasonable need to perform a protective sweep\r\nof the premises). While Johnson claims the deputies viewed the evidence by\r\nimproperly entering and re-entering the room while waiting for the warrant, the\r\n\ndeputies testified that the evidence giving rise to probable cause was all visible\r\nduring the protective sweep. The deputies maintained they did not manipulate the\r\nevidence in any way. Additionally, the reasonableness of the deputies' conduct can\r\nbe inferred from their decision to obtain a search warrant before fully searching the\r\nroom. See Abdullah, 357 S.C. at 352, 592 S.E.2d at 348 (holding \"the\r\nreasonableness of the officers' conduct may be further gleaned from the decision to\r\nsecure a warrant to seize the contraband once the protective sweep was concluded\r\nand exigent circumstances unquestionably ceased to exist\").\r\n\r\nWe disagree with Johnson's contention that this case resembles the facts of Brown,\r\n289 S.C. 581, 347 S.E.2d 882, in which our supreme court found exigent\r\ncircumstances did not excuse a warrantless search. In Brown, law enforcement\r\nnever obtained an arrest or search warrant despite performing surveillance of a\r\nmurder suspect's motel room for two and one-half hours. Id. at 586, 347 S.E.2d at\r\n885. Law enforcement eventually called the suspect via phone and ordered him\r\nand any others to exit the room. Id. After the suspect and others exited the room\r\nand were arrested, law enforcement performed a protective sweep of the room. Id.\r\nOur supreme court noted that the protective sweep was justified because it was\r\nreasonable to believe that concealed persons within the room might pose a danger.\r\nId. at 587, 347 S.E.2d at 886. However, the court held the State failed to meet its\r\nburden of proof to justify the warrantless search under the exigent circumstances\r\nexception because the State could not explain law enforcement's failure to obtain\r\nany type of warrant during the lengthy surveillance period. Id. at 587-88, 347\r\nS.E.2d at 886. Such facts are distinguishable from the case at hand, as the deputies\r\nhad a valid arrest warrant and the entry and protective sweep of the hotel room\r\nwere immediately incident to executing that arrest warrant.\r\n\r\n\"Under the 'plain view' exception to the warrant requirement, objects falling within\r\nthe plain view of a law enforcement officer who is rightfully in a position to view\r\nthe objects are subject to seizure and may be introduced as evidence.\" State v.\r\nBeckham, 334 S.C. 302, 317, 513 S.E.2d 606, 613 (1999). To satisfy the \"plain\r\nview\" exception, two elements must be met: \"(1) the initial intrusion which\r\nafforded the authorities the plain view was lawful and (2) the incriminating nature\r\nof the evidence was immediately apparent to the seizing authorities.\" Wright, 391\r\nS.C. at 443, 706 S.E.2d at 327.\r\n\r\nWe find the initial intrusion which afforded the authorities the plain view of the\r\nevidence was lawful. The validity of Quinn's arrest warrant has not been\r\nchallenged, and \"police are allowed to enter a hotel room to arrest an occupant\r\n\nwhen acting pursuant to a valid arrest warrant.\" Goins v. State, 397 S.C. 568, 574,\r\n726 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2012). Johnson claims in his brief that Quinn was in custody\r\nwhen the deputies entered the hotel room, and thus the initial warrantless search of\r\nthe room was illegal. He cites United States v. Coles, 437 F.3d 361, 366 (3d Cir.\r\n2006) for the proposition that \"[e]xigent circumstances, however, do not meet\r\nFourth Amendment standards if the government deliberately creates them.\"\r\nHowever, each of the deputies testified that they entered the hotel room to arrest\r\nQuinn after she backed further into the room; therefore, the deputies' initial\r\nintrusion into the room was justified by the execution of a valid arrest warrant.\r\nFurthermore, as the deputies' protective sweep shortly after entering the room was\r\njustified through the exigent circumstance of ensuring officer safety, the deputies'\r\nintrusion that afforded them the plain view of the evidence was lawful.\r\n\r\nWe also find the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent to\r\nthe deputies. Upon initially entering the room, the deputies observed an inordinate\r\nnumber of computers, many in states of disassembly. Deputy Bolin testified the\r\npresence of multiple disassembled computers constituted probable cause that a\r\ncrime had been committed because of the \"amount of time that [the occupants]\r\nwere in the hotel room, the amount of computers in the hotel room, and the work\r\nthat was being done to them.\" He suspected the computers had been stolen and\r\nwere being used to extract personal information from the hard drives. Deputy\r\nStagner stated the large number of computers and equipment was suspicious given\r\nthat Quinn had checked into the hotel the previous day; he also noted that\r\ncomputers could be used in manufacturing narcotics. During the protective sweep,\r\nthe deputies observed two uncapped syringes, a package of razor blades, and\r\naluminum foil packaging consistent with drug packaging. While not stated in the\r\nsearch warrant, Deputy Stagner also observed a digital scale. The deputies\r\nconsidered this evidence indicative of illegal drug activity.\r\n\r\nThe testimony presented at the suppression hearing indicated that the incriminating\r\nnature of the evidence in the hotel room was immediately apparent to the deputies.\r\nFurthermore, Deputy Gladden testified that prior to her arrival at the hotel, she\r\nreceived information that Quinn might be under the influence of\r\nmethamphetamine. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we find the\r\nmagistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed to justify\r\nthe issuance of a search warrant. See State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519\r\nS.E.2d 347, 348 (1999) (stating a magistrate may issue a search warrant only upon\r\na finding of probable cause); State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 290, 494 S.E.2d 801,\r\n802 (1997) (\"A reviewing court should give great deference to a magistrate's\r\n\ndetermination of probable cause.\"); State v. Davis, 354 S.C. 348, 356, 580 S.E.2d\r\n778, 782 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that a magistrate making a probable cause\r\ndetermination should \"'make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all\r\nthe circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, . . . there is a fair probability\r\nthat contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place'\"\r\n(alteration in original) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 214 (1983))); State\r\nv. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 683, 583 S.E.2d 437, 441 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"An appellate\r\ncourt reviewing the decision to issue a search warrant should decide whether the\r\nmagistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed. This\r\nreview, like the determination by the magistrate, is governed by the 'totality of the\r\ncircumstances' test.\" (internal citations omitted)). The search warrant obtained for\r\nthe hotel room was properly founded on probable cause resulting from items in\r\nplain view of deputies lawfully conducting a protective sweep. Therefore, we hold\r\nthe circuit court acted within its discretion in admitting the evidence obtained in\r\nthe search of the hotel room.\r\n\r\nII.   Circuit Court's Rulings Concerning the Weight of Methamphetamine\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-375(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013)4 states:\r\n\r\n             (C) A person who knowingly sells, manufactures,\r\n             delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who\r\n             provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets,\r\n             attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver,\r\n             purchase, or bring into this State, or who is knowingly in\r\n             actual or constructive possession or who knowingly\r\n             attempts to become in actual or constructive possession\r\n             of ten grams or more of methamphetamine or cocaine\r\n             base, as defined and otherwise limited in Section 44-53-\r\n             110, 44-53-210(d)(1), or 44-53-210(d)(2), is guilty of a\r\n             felony which is known as \"trafficking in\r\n             methamphetamine or cocaine base\" . . . .\r\n\r\nThe statute goes on to prescribe sentencing based on the amount of\r\nmethamphetamine involved. See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(C)(2) (Supp. 2013)\r\n\r\n4The code provision in effect at the time Johnson committed the offense in 2011\r\nhas not since been amended; thus, we cite to the current version of section 44-53-\r\n375.\r\n\n(setting the punishment for \"trafficking in methamphetamine or cocaine base\" in an\r\namount of twenty-eight grams or more, but less than one hundred grams).\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-110 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013)5 defines\r\nmethamphetamine: \"'Methamphetamine' includes any salt, isomer, or salt of an\r\nisomer, or any mixture or compound containing amphetamine or\r\nmethamphetamine. Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as 'crank', 'ice', or\r\n'crystal meth'\" (emphasis added). Additionally, subsection 44-53-210(d)(2) (Supp.\r\n2013)6 states Schedule II narcotics include: \"Unless specifically excepted or unless\r\nlisted in another schedule, any material, compound, mixture, or preparation which\r\ncontains any quantity of the following substances having a stimulant effect on the\r\ncentral nervous system: . . . Methamphetamine, its salts, and salts of isomers\"\r\n(emphasis added). In regards to the weight of controlled substances, section 44-\r\n53-392 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013)7 states, \"Notwithstanding any\r\nother provision of this article, the weight of any controlled substance referenced in\r\nthis article is the weight of that substance in pure form or any compound or\r\nmixture thereof\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe language of section 44-53-392, which defines the weight of methamphetamine\r\nas \"the weight of that substance in pure form or any compound or mixture thereof,\"\r\nis plain and unambiguous, and clearly and definitely includes a mixture containing\r\nliquid and methamphetamine. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to\r\nascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. State v. Jacobs, 393 S.C. 584,\r\n587, 713 S.E.2d 621, 622 (2011). \"As such, a court must abide by the plain\r\nmeaning of the words of a statute.\" Id. \"'This Court should give words their plain\r\nand ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\nexpand the statute's operation.'\" Grazia v. S.C. State Plastering, LLC, 390 S.C.\r\n\r\n5 Section 44-53-110 has recently been amended by 2014 S.C. Laws Acts 221. The\r\nrelevant language quoted here is not affected by the amendment, but it is now\r\nfound at subsection 44-53-110(28).\r\n6The code provision in effect at the time Johnson committed the offense in 2011\r\nhas not since been amended; thus, we cite to the current version of section 44-53-\r\n210.\r\n7The code provision in effect at the time Johnson committed the offense in 2011\r\nhas not since been amended; thus, we cite to the current version of section 44-53-\r\n392.\r\n\n562, 569, 703 S.E.2d 197, 200 (2010) (quoting Ward v. West Oil Co., Inc., 387\r\nS.C. 268, 273-74, 692 S.E.2d 516, 519 (2010)). \"Where the statute's language is\r\nplain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of\r\nstatutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\nmeaning.\" Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000). \"'What\r\na legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the\r\nlegislative intent or will. Therefore, the courts are bound to give effect to the\r\nexpressed intent of the legislature.'\" Id. (quoting Norman J. Singer, Sutherland\r\nStatutory Construction § 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992)). We are convinced the plain\r\nand ordinary meaning of the statute defines the weight of methamphetamine to\r\ninclude the weight of the mixture of liquid and methamphetamine at issue in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWe do not agree with Johnson's contention that the legislature requires the\r\nmethamphetamine to be usable methamphetamine, nor do we agree that the statute\r\ndisregards the weight of byproducts in the manufacturing process. Subsection 44-\r\n53-376(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013)8 states, \"It is unlawful for a\r\nperson to knowingly cause to be disposed any waste from the production of\r\nmethamphetamine or knowingly assist, solicit, or conspire with another to dispose\r\nof methamphetamine waste.\" Johnson cites subsection 44-53-376(A) in arguing\r\nthat South Carolina drug statutes recognize that methamphetamine contains\r\nunusable by-products, and \"any mixture\" of methamphetamine was not intended to\r\ninclude the waste from the production of the drug. We disagree with this\r\nargument, as the plain and unambiguous language of sections 44-53-110, 44-53-\r\n210, 44-53-375, and 44-53-392 clearly and definitely includes a mixture containing\r\nliquid and methamphetamine. Additionally, section 44-53-392 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2013) states, \"Notwithstanding any other provision of this\r\narticle, the weight of any controlled substance referenced in this article is the\r\nweight of that substance in pure form or any compound or mixture thereof\"\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nJohnson argues the circuit court improperly relied on State v. Kerr, 299 S.C. 108,\r\n382 S.E.2d 895 (1989), in ruling on this issue. In Kerr, our supreme court held\r\nsection 44-53-370, by its clear and unambiguous terms, applied to the weight of a\r\nmixture containing cocaine and not merely the weight of the cocaine in its pure\r\n\r\n8The code provision in effect at the time Johnson committed the offense in 2011\r\nhas not since been amended; thus, we cite to the current version of section 44-53-\r\n376.\r\n\nform. Id. at 109, 382 S.E.2d at 896. The court then quoted from Sheriff of\r\nHumboldt Cnty. v. Lang, 763 P.2d 56, 58-59 (Nev. 1988), to express the rationale\r\nbehind the statute, explaining that diluted cocaine increases the amount of\r\nconsumption and potential harm. Kerr, 299 S.C. at 109-10, 382 S.E.2d at 896-97.\r\nJohnson points out that this rationale does not exist with respect to unfinished\r\nmixtures of methamphetamine. However, the circuit court never attributed the\r\nreasoning expressed in Kerr and Lang to the methamphetamine statute; in fact, the\r\ncourt noted that this reasoning would not apply to an unfinished mixture of\r\nmethamphetamine. Instead, the circuit court found that the statutory language\r\nregarding methamphetamine was similar to the unambiguous statutory language in\r\nKerr, and the court presumed the legislature had considered the \"extremely\r\ndangerous\" process of manufacturing methamphetamine. The statutory language\r\ndeemed clear and unambiguous in Kerr read, \"The weight of any controlled\r\nsubstance in this subsection includes the substance in pure form or any compound\r\nor mixture of the substance.\" Id. at 109, 382 S.E.2d at 896 (emphasis omitted)\r\n(quoting S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-370(e) (1985)). This language is nearly identical\r\nto the language of section 44-53-392, which we find similarly clear and\r\nunambiguous.\r\n\r\nJohnson notes that some federal and state courts use the \"market-oriented\"\r\napproach when determining the weight of methamphetamine. See 21 U.S.C. §\r\n841(b)(1)(A)(viii) (setting the punishment for a violation involving \"50 grams or\r\nmore of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers or 500 grams\r\nor more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\r\nmethamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers\"); Chapman v. United\r\nStates, 500 U.S. 453, 461 (1991) (\"Congress adopted a 'market-oriented' approach\r\nto punishing drug trafficking, under which the total quantity of what is distributed,\r\nrather than the amount of pure drug involved, is used to determine the length of the\r\nsentence.\"). We find this argument unpersuasive. Unlike the states from which\r\nJohnson cited case law9, we find no authority, either in statute or in common law,\r\nin which this state has adopted or modeled itself after federal drug sentencing laws\r\nor the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which distinguish between\r\nmethamphetamine and a mixture of methamphetamine.\r\n\r\nJohnson also contends the circuit court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a\r\njury trial when the court precluded him from arguing to the jury that the entire\r\n\r\n9Johnson cited State v. Magness, 165 S.W.3d 300, 303-04 (Tenn. Crim. App.\r\n2004), and State v. Slovik, 71 P.3d 159, 161-63 (Or. Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\nweight of the mixture could not be counted against him. He alleges this error\r\ndeprived him of a trial by jury on an essential element of the offense. See\r\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 477 (2000) (noting a criminal defendant is\r\nentitled to \"a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime\r\nwith which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt\" (alteration in original)\r\n(quoting United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 510 (1995))). We find the circuit\r\ncourt did not err in precluding Johnson from making this argument to the jury, as\r\nthis argument is an erroneous statement of law. See State v. Portee, 278 S.C. 260,\r\n261, 294 S.E.2d 421, 422 (1982) (finding it improper when a prosecutor made an\r\nerroneous statement of law to the jury).10\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 As we do not find the circuit court erred in concluding the weight of the mixture\r\nwas to be considered, we need not address the State's harmless error argument. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (noting an appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\nits determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5247","title":"State v.

Upon appeal to the circuit court, his conviction was affirmed.\r\nWe reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n                    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nHaygood appeared before Magistrate Samuel A. Daily for a bench trial on the\r\ncharge of CDV. The State presented Lieutenant Lacra Jenkins as its only witness,\r\nwhile Haygood presented no evidence at his trial. According to the magistrate's\r\n\nreturn,1 Lt. Jenkins \"testified as to what took place during his initial investigation,\r\nafter he responded to an alleged CDV call\" on March 31, 2008. The return\r\nindicates the lieutenant testified as follows:\r\n\r\n             Upon arrival he stated that the victim[,] Towanna\r\n             Haygood[,] was very upset. During his investigation he\r\n             stated that the alleged victim, Towanna Haygood[,] stated\r\n             to him that her husband beg[a]n fighting her in the\r\n             bedroom and he stated to her that he was going to kill\r\n             her. Lt. Jenkins then testified that Mrs. Haygood stated\r\n             that Mr. Haygood went to the bedroom closet and\r\n             retrieved a brown in color shotgun and that her 14 [year-\r\n             old] son struggle[d] with him to take the shotgun away\r\n             from him. Mrs. Haygood then told him that Mr.\r\n             Haygood reached in his pants pocket where he keeps a\r\n             small handgun at times. She then grabbed his pants\r\n             pocket causing some small bullets to fall to the floor.\r\n             She stated to him that Mr. Haygood then went outside the\r\n             resident but came back and punch[ed] a hole in the\r\n             bedroom closet. Lt. Jenkins stated that when he arrived\r\n             on the scene he observed Mr. Haygood being highly\r\n             intoxicated. When he tried talking to him[,] he beg[a]n\r\n             using profanity, stating that this was his house and that he\r\n             would do anything he wishes. Lt. Jenkins further\r\n             testified that Henry and Towanna Haygood were married\r\n             at the time of the incident and ha[d] a child in common.\r\n\r\nAs to objections and rulings during the trial, the return indicates trial counsel\r\nobjected to the State's \"introduction of verbal statements made by the alleged\r\nvictim to the investigating officer\" that were \"pertaining to allegations of what\r\n[Haygood] did on the date [in] question.\" It additionally notes the State took the\r\nposition that the officer's duty, after being dispatched to an alleged CDV, \"was to\r\ndo an investigation of the incident and be prepared to testify as to the facts (during\r\nhis investigation) at trial,\" and that the testimony in question qualified as an excited\r\nutterance. The magistrate overruled Haygood's objection, \"agree[ing] with the\r\nState that in some criminal domestic violence [cases] the investigating officer of\r\n\r\n1The return indicates these proceedings were recorded electronically. However,\r\nHaygood's trial counsel informed the circuit court that when she requested a copy\r\nof the recording, she was told the recording was no longer available.\r\n\nthe alleged incident should be allowed to testify as to the finding of facts during his\r\ninvestigation.\" The magistrate found Haygood guilty of CDV and sentenced him\r\nto thirty days in jail or a fine of $2,130.00, suspended upon completion of a\r\nbatterer's intervention program.\r\n\r\nHaygood appealed his conviction to the circuit court on the ground that the\r\nintroduction of the alleged verbal statements violated his Sixth Amendment right to\r\nconfront witnesses against him pursuant to Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36\r\n(2004), arguing the alleged victim was not unavailable for trial and the defense had\r\nno opportunity to cross examine the victim such that it was error to admit the\r\ntestimonial statements. In argument before the circuit court, trial counsel noted she\r\nhad objected on the basis of Crawford to the State's attempt to introduce oral\r\nstatements given by the victim though the officer. Counsel further recounted for\r\nthe circuit court that the State had argued the information in the oral statement by\r\nthe victim was an excited utterance and she again had objected to admission of the\r\nevidence before the magistrate based on Crawford, noting hearsay was not the\r\nissue. Trial counsel reiterated to the circuit court that the magistrate ruled the\r\ntestimony of the officer was admissible as an excited utterance, but that was not\r\nher objection. Rather, her argument was based on Crawford, as the officer was\r\neliciting testimony on statements made by the alleged victim and the alleged victim\r\nwas not present for her to have an opportunity to cross-examine. Counsel asserted\r\nthat, pursuant to Crawford, the State had the burden of proving a victim was\r\nunavailable and that the defendant had a previous opportunity to cross-examine the\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nThe solicitor agreed that this case turned on whether or not the statements were\r\n\"testimony.\" However, he maintained the State disagreed that Crawford provided\r\nthat excited utterances no longer qualified as exceptions to the rule against hearsay.\r\nHe argued the magistrate decided the issue \"based on whether or not the testimony\r\nthe officer was giving was that of the testimony of variety,\" and the magistrate\r\nused the correct application of law in deeming it to be an excited utterance\r\nexception to hearsay and \"not testimony.\" The solicitor further distinguished the\r\nmatter at hand from Crawford on the basis that Crawford involved a recorded\r\nstatement made during a police interrogation, whereas the statement in the case at\r\nhand was made to an officer arriving at the scene and was nontestimonial and\r\nqualified as an excited utterance. The solicitor argued, in this case, the magistrate\r\nheard testimony that the officer arrived shortly after the incident,2 weapons were\r\n\r\n2Our review reveals no evidence in the record concerning how soon after the\r\nincident occurred the officer arrived.\r\n\ninvolved, and the victim's child was involved, showing the victim was in an excited\r\nstate. Thus, the solicitor maintained, \"because the statement was taken\r\nimmediately after the start of the event while [the declarant] was still under stress\r\nfrom the start of the event,\" the testimony met every element of an excited\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court took the matter under advisement and thereafter issued an order\r\ndenying Haygood's appeal. In its decision, the circuit court noted Haygood's\r\nappeal was based on the magistrate's admission of a statement by the victim which\r\nwas testified to by the responding officer. The court then stated, \"[Haygood]\r\nclaims that this statement should be excluded based on the fact that it is hearsay.\"\r\nAfter evaluating the statement under Rule 803(2), SCRE, the circuit court found\r\nthe statement qualified as an excited utterance and found it admissible as an\r\nexception to the rule against hearsay. The circuit court additionally found the\r\nmatter at hand distinguishable from Crawford on the basis that case dealt with a\r\nrecorded statement taken in a custodial interrogation. Further, it determined the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court (USSC) deemed the statement in Crawford\r\ninadmissible, not because it fell within the excited utterance hearsay exception, but\r\nbecause it bore a particularized guarantee of trustworthiness. The circuit court then\r\nconcluded the statements testified to by Lt. Jenkins were admissible under the\r\nexcited utterance exception and, because the statements fell within a long\r\nestablished exception to the rule against hearsay, their admission did not violate the\r\nConfrontation Clause. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\n                                        ISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether Haygood's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by the\r\nadmission of testimonial hearsay under the excited utterance exception without an\r\nopportunity of cross-examination by the defense.\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a\r\nmanifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.\" State v.\r\nDouglas, 369 S.C. 424, 429, 632 S.E.2d 845, 847-48 (2006). \"An abuse of\r\ndiscretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary\r\nsupport or are controlled by an error of law.\" Id. at 429-30, 632 S.E.2d at 848.\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS \n\r\n\nHaygood contends the circuit court violated his right to confrontation when it\r\nfound testimonial hearsay admissible under the excited utterance exception to the\r\nrule against hearsay. Haygood first asserts the circuit court erred in finding the\r\ntestimonial statements made by the alleged victim to the police did not violate the\r\nConfrontation Clause because the statements fell within the excited utterance\r\nexception to hearsay. He argues, under Crawford, the statements were testimonial\r\nin nature, and while the statements were arguably given in excited utterance,\r\nbecause they were testimonial in nature they required a Sixth Amendment\r\nconfrontation by the defense. Haygood also argues the circuit court erred in\r\ndistinguishing this case from Crawford on the bases that the statement in Crawford\r\n(1) was taken in a custodial interrogation and (2) was not an excited utterance.\r\nLastly, in response to the State's assertion that the issue is not preserved for\r\nappellate review, Haygood contends trial counsel presented the arguments to both\r\nthe magistrate and the circuit court, and both improperly conflated counsel's Sixth\r\nAmendment argument with the excited utterance hearsay exception. Based upon\r\nthe improper admission of the testimonial statements, Haygood requests this court\r\nreverse his conviction and remand the matter for a new trial. We find the issue is\r\nproperly preserved for our review, and agree with Haygood that admission of the\r\nstatements in question violated his constitutional right to confrontation, requiring\r\nreversal of his conviction.\r\n\r\n   I.     Preservation\r\n\r\n\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\" State v.\r\nCope, 405 S.C. 317, 338-39, 748 S.E.2d 194, 205 (2013) (quoting Herron v.\r\nCentury BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 465, 719 S.E.2d 640, 642 (2012)). \"For an issue to\r\nbe properly preserved it has to be raised to and ruled on by the trial court.\" State v.\r\nJennings, 394 S.C. 473, 481, 716 S.E.2d 91, 95 (2011). An argument advanced on\r\nappeal but not raised and ruled on below is not preserved. State v. Freiburger, 366\r\nS.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005).\r\n\r\n\"Issue preservation rules are designed to give the trial court a fair opportunity to\r\nrule on the issues, and thus provide us with a platform for meaningful appellate\r\nreview.\" Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC v. Lewis, 398 S.C. 323, 329, 730\r\nS.E.2d 282, 285 (2012) (quoting Queen's Grant II Horizontal Prop. Regime v.\r\nGreenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 373, 628 S.E.2d 902, 919 (Ct. App. 2006)).\r\n\"[T]his is not a 'gotcha' game aimed at embarrassing attorneys or harming litigants,\r\nbut rather is an adherence to settled principles that serve an important function.\"\r\nId. at 329-30, 730 S.E.2d at 285. Though our appellate courts should follow\r\n\nlongstanding precedent and resolve an issue on preservation grounds when it\r\n\"clearly is unpreserved,\" it is \"good practice for us to reach the merits of an issue\r\nwhen error preservation is doubtful.\" Id. at 330, 730 S.E.2d at 285.\r\n\r\nAlthough the magistrate's return does not specifically mention Crawford or the\r\nConfrontation Clause, the return does indicate trial counsel objected to the State's\r\n\"introduction of verbal statements made by the victim to the investigating officer\"\r\nthat \"pertain[ed] to allegations of what [Haygood] did on the date [in] question.\"\r\nAdditionally, the return indicates the magistrate overruled Haygood's objection,\r\n\"agree[ing] with the State that in some criminal domestic violence [cases] the\r\ninvestigating officer of the alleged incident should be allowed to testify as to the\r\nfinding of facts during his investigation.\" Thus, a review of the return shows the\r\nissue of whether Haygood's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated\r\nby the admission of testimonial hearsay under the excited utterance exception\r\nwithout an opportunity of cross-examination by the defense is not \"clearly . . .\r\nunpreserved.\" Id. Further, the colloquy between trial counsel, counsel for the\r\nState, and the circuit court judge during Haygood's appeal to the circuit court\r\nindicates this issue was in fact argued before the magistrate. Trial counsel\r\nexplicitly stated to the circuit court that she informed the magistrate her objection\r\nwas based on Crawford. The fact that trial counsel noted to the circuit court that\r\nthe magistrate ruled the testimony was admissible as an excited utterance, in spite\r\nof the fact that hearsay was not her objection, is an indication that the magistrate\r\nbelieved the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule was dispositive of trial\r\ncounsel's Crawford argument. We do not agree, as the State propounds, that the\r\nargument before the circuit court shows Haygood conceded the magistrate never\r\nruled on the Crawford objection. Rather, it simply indicates the magistrate\r\noverruled the Crawford objection, finding the excited utterance exception to be\r\ncontrolling. Additionally, the solicitor stated to the circuit court, \"I agree that this\r\ncase turns on what [trial counsel] spoke of, and that's specifically whether or not\r\nthis [statement is] testimony. That's what Crawford speaks to.\" The solicitor also\r\nrecounted for the circuit court that the magistrate \"decided this issue of evidence\r\nbased on whether or not the testimony the officer was giving was that of the\r\ntestimony of variety,\" and the magistrate correctly determined the testimony was\r\nadmissible as a hearsay exception, \"an excited utterance, [and it was] not\r\ntestimony.\" Further, the solicitor specifically argued the statement in question was\r\n\"not a testimonial statement,\" but was instead an excited utterance, and again\r\nproclaimed \"[t]his is not a testimonial statement.\" The solicitor then attempted to\r\n\ndistinguish Crawford. Based on the record before us, we find the issue is\r\npreserved for our review.3\r\n\r\n    II.   Confrontation Clause Law\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause guarantees that \"[i]n all criminal\r\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the\r\nwitnesses against him.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. \"The constitutional right to\r\nconfront and cross examine witnesses is essential to a fair trial in that it promotes\r\nreliability in criminal trials and insures that convictions will not result from\r\ntestimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.\" State v. Martin, 292\r\nS.C. 437, 439, 357 S.E.2d 21, 22 (1987). An analysis of three seminal USSC cases\r\n\r\n3 As previously noted, the trial proceedings were electronically recorded, but when\r\ntrial counsel sought to obtain the recording in preparation for appeal, she was\r\ninformed the recording was no longer available. Thus, we do not have the benefit\r\nof knowing what occurred at the trial level to determine exactly what arguments\r\nwere made to the magistrate in regard to admission of this evidence and how the\r\nmagistrate specifically ruled at that time. The State does not argue Crawford, and\r\nthe Confrontation Clause was never raised to the magistrate, but only that such was\r\nnever specifically ruled on by the magistrate. However, argument before the\r\ncircuit court demonstrates the issue was raised to the magistrate, and the return\r\nindicates \"[t]he court overruled [Haygood's] objections.\" We do not believe the\r\ndefendant should be penalized by the loss of the recording and the vagueness of the\r\nmagistrate's return on this point, especially in light of the fact that the appeal before\r\nthe circuit court clearly indicates the matter was raised to the magistrate, and the\r\nState did not, on appeal to the circuit court, object based on error preservation.\r\nAdditionally, though the State refers to section 18-7-80 of the South Carolina Code\r\nas granting the circuit court the authority to direct the magistrate to amend\r\ndeficiencies in the return, and thus supporting its argument the matter is not\r\npreserved, this section simply allows the appellate court to direct a \"further or\r\namended return,\" should \"the return be defective.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 18-7-80\r\n(2014). There is nothing to indicate the circuit court or either of the parties\r\nbelieved the return was defective or that either party considered the issue not ruled\r\nupon by the magistrate or in any way unpreserved for review. Finally, the matter is\r\nclearly preserved as far having been raised to the circuit court acting as an\r\nintermediate appellate court. Cf. State v. Oxner, 391 S.C. 132, 134, 705 S.E.2d 51,\r\n52 (2011) (\"An argument that is not raised to an intermediate appellate court is not\r\npreserved for review by this Court.\").\r\n\nleads us to the conclusion that the admission of the statements at hand violated\r\nHaygood's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.\r\n\r\n   A. Crawford v. Washington\r\n\r\nIn Crawford, Michael Crawford was convicted of assaulting a man who allegedly\r\ntried to rape Crawford's wife. Id. at 38, 41. At trial, the State played for the jury\r\nthe wife's tape-recorded statement to the police describing the stabbing, even\r\nthough Crawford had no opportunity for cross-examination. Id. The State invoked\r\nthe hearsay exception for statements against penal interest in its quest to admit the\r\nwife's statement. Id. at 40. Previously, the law set forth in Ohio v. Roberts, 448\r\nU.S. 56 (1980), abrogated by Crawford, provided that the Confrontation Clause did\r\nnot bar admission of an unavailable witness's statement against a criminal\r\ndefendant if the statement bore \"adequate 'indicia of reliability'\" — a test that could\r\nbe met by showing the evidence either (1) fell within a firmly rooted hearsay\r\nexception, or (2) bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Id. at 40. The\r\ntrial court admitted the statement of Crawford's wife on the basis it bore\r\nparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Id. The USSC reversed Crawford's\r\nconviction, finding the State admitted the wife's testimonial statement against\r\nCrawford despite the fact that he had no opportunity to cross-examine her, thereby\r\nviolating Crawford's Sixth Amendment rights. Id. at 68.\r\n\r\nIn revisiting Roberts, the USSC noted the Confrontation Clause \"applies to\r\n'witnesses' against the accused — in other words, those who 'bear testimony.'\" Id.\r\nat 51. It then observed:\r\n\r\n             \"Testimony,\" in turn, is typically \"[a] solemn declaration\r\n             or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or\r\n             proving some fact.\" An accuser who makes a formal\r\n             statement to government officers bears testimony in a\r\n             sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an\r\n             acquaintance does not. The constitutional text, like the\r\n             history underlying the common-law right of\r\n             confrontation, thus reflects an especially acute concern\r\n             with a specific type of out-of-court statement.\r\n\r\nId. at 51 (citation omitted). The USSC found \"[a]dmitting statements deemed\r\nreliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation,\" and\r\nthough the Confrontation Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence,\r\nit commands that \"reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the\r\n\ncrucible of cross-examination.\" Id. at 61. It determined \"[t]he Roberts test\r\nallow[ed] a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a\r\nmere judicial determination of reliability,\" and it \"replace[d] the constitutionally\r\nprescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.\" Id. at 62.\r\nThe USSC concluded \"[t]he unpardonable vice of the Roberts test . . [was] not its\r\nunpredictability, but its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements\r\nthat the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.\" Id. at 63.\r\n\r\nUpon reconsideration of Roberts, the USSC held the Confrontation Clause bars\r\nadmission of testimonial hearsay statements of a witness absent from trial unless:\r\n(1) the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial, and (2) the accused had a prior\r\nopportunity to cross-examine the declarant. 541 U.S. at 53-54, 58, 68. Thus, even\r\nif a statement is admissible hearsay, the Confrontation Clause may operate to\r\nrender the otherwise admissible hearsay evidence inadmissible if it is testimonial in\r\nnature. See id. at 68 (holding testimonial evidence implicates the Sixth\r\nAmendment, which demands unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-\r\nexamination, but the admission of nontestimonial hearsay evidence remains the\r\nprovince of each state's development of hearsay law). Included within the \"core\r\nclass of 'testimonial' statements\" by the court in Crawford are \"statements that\r\nwere made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably\r\nto believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial[.]\" Id. at 51-\r\n52. \"Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations\" are\r\nconsidered testimonial. Id. at 52; See also id. at 53 (\"[E]ven if the Sixth\r\nAmendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary\r\nobject, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that\r\nclass.\"). The USSC characterized its use of the term \"interrogation\" as being used\r\nin its colloquial sense, \"rather than in any technical legal, sense.\" Id. at 53 n.4.\r\nThough it declined, in Crawford, to \"spell out a comprehensive definition of\r\n'testimonial,'\" it noted, at a minimum, it applied \"to prior testimony at a\r\npreliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police\r\ninterrogations.\" Id. at 68. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n   B. Davis v. Washington and Hammon v. Indiana\r\n\r\nFollowing the 2004 Crawford opinion, in Davis v. Washington and Hammon v.\r\nIndiana, 547 U.S. 813 (2006), the USSC took steps to \"determine more precisely\"\r\nwhich statements made pursuant to police interrogation are testimonial in nature.\r\nId. at 822. Specifically, the court was tasked with determining whether statements\r\nmade to law enforcement during a 911 call as well as statements made at a crime\r\nscene were \"testimonial\" and therefore subject to the Confrontation Clause. Id. at\r\n\n817. There, the court dealt with two different domestic disturbance cases: one\r\ninvolving a victim's identification of her abuser in response to initial questions\r\nfrom a 911 emergency operator (Davis), and the other involving oral statements\r\nmade by a victim to police, as well as an affidavit written and signed by the victim,\r\nprovided at the scene, wherein the victim gave an account of what had occurred\r\nbetween her and her husband (Hammon). Id. at 817-18, 819-20. In Davis, the\r\nrelevant statements were made in a 911 call wherein the operator ascertained the\r\nvictim was involved in a domestic situation with Davis, the victim relaying at the\r\ntime of the call that Davis was jumping on her and using his fists. Id. at 817. The\r\npolice arrived within four minutes of the call and observed the victim in a shaken\r\nstate with fresh injuries, frantically attempting to gather her belongings and her\r\nchildren so she could leave the residence. Id. at 818. In Hammon, after police\r\nresponded to a reported domestic disturbance, they found the victim alone on her\r\nfront porch, appearing \"somewhat frightened,\" but stating to officers \"nothing was\r\nthe matter.\" Id. at 819. The victim's husband, who was in the kitchen, told the\r\npolice he and his wife had been in an argument but \"everything was fine now,\" and\r\nthe argument between them had never become physical. Id. While one officer\r\nremained with the husband, another attempted to speak with the victim in the\r\nliving room, again asking her what had occurred. Id. The husband made several\r\nattempts to participate in the victim's conversation with police, and the officer\r\ntestified the husband became angry when he insisted the husband stay separated\r\nfrom the victim so the officer could investigate what had happened. Id. 819-20.\r\nAfter hearing the victim's account, the officer had her fill out and sign an affidavit,\r\nwherein the victim indicated her husband broke their furnace, shoved the victim\r\nonto the ground into broken glass, hit her in the chest, threw her down, broke\r\nlamps and a phone, tore up her van so she could not leave the house, and attacked\r\nthe victim's daughter. Id. at 820.\r\n\r\nIn approaching its analysis of the two situations, the USSC stated as follows:\r\n\r\n             Without attempting to produce an exhaustive\r\n             classification of all conceivable statements — or even all\r\n             conceivable statements in response to police\r\n             interrogation — as either testimonial or nontestimonial, it\r\n             suffices to decide the present cases to hold as follows:\r\n             Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course\r\n             of police interrogation under circumstances objectively\r\n             indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is\r\n             to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing\r\n             emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances\r\n\n             objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing\r\n             emergency, and that the primary purpose of the\r\n             interrogation is to establish or prove past events\r\n             potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nId. at 822. Additionally, the court noted, \"even when interrogation exists, it is in\r\nthe final analysis the declarant's statements, not the interrogator's questions, that\r\nthe Confrontation Clause requires [the courts] to evaluate.\" Id. at 822 n.1.\r\n\r\nApplying this law to the facts of the two domestic violence cases, the USSC\r\nconcluded the statements in Davis identifying the assailant in the course of the 911\r\ncall were nontestimonial, while the statements produced by the interrogation in\r\nHammon were \"inherently testimonial.\" Id. at 829, 830.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, as to the 911 call in Davis, the USSC noted as follows:\r\n\r\n             When we said in Crawford, supra, at 53, 124 S.Ct. 1354,\r\n             that \"interrogations by law enforcement officers fall\r\n             squarely within [the] class\" of testimonial hearsay, we\r\n             had immediately in mind (for that was the case before us)\r\n             interrogations solely directed at establishing the facts of a\r\n             past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to\r\n             convict) the perpetrator. The product of such\r\n             interrogation, whether reduced to a writing signed by the\r\n             declarant or embedded in the memory (and perhaps\r\n             notes) of the interrogating officer, is testimonial. It is, in\r\n             the terms of the 1828 American dictionary quoted in\r\n             Crawford, \" '[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made\r\n             for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.' \"\r\n             541 U.S., at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. . . . A 911 call, on the\r\n             other hand, and at least the initial interrogation conducted\r\n             in connection with a 911 call, is ordinarily not designed\r\n             primarily to \"establis[h] or prov[e]\" some past fact, but to\r\n             describe current circumstances requiring police\r\n             assistance.\r\n\r\nId. at 826-27. The Supreme Court then discussed the differences between the call\r\nfrom the 911 victim in Davis and the interrogation of the wife in Crawford, noting\r\nas follows: (1) in Davis, the victim was speaking about events as they were\r\nactually occurring, rather than describing past events, while the wife's interrogation\r\n\nin Crawford took place hours after the events she described had occurred; (2)\r\nunlike the wife in Crawford, \"any reasonable listener would recognize\" that the\r\nvictim making the 911 call in Davis was facing an ongoing emergency; (3) the\r\nnature of what was asked and answered in Davis was such that the elicited\r\nstatements were necessary to be able to resolve the present emergency rather than\r\nsimply to learn, as in Crawford, what had occurred in the past; and (4) there were\r\ndistinct levels of formality between the two cases, with the wife in Crawford\r\nresponding calmly at the station house to a series of questions with the officer-\r\ninterrogator taping and making notes, while the victim in Davis provided frantic\r\nanswers over the phone in an environment that was not tranquil or even safe. Id. at\r\n827. Against this backdrop, the USSC concluded the circumstances of\r\ninterrogation in Davis \"objectively indicate[d] its primary purpose was to enable\r\npolice assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\" and the caller in the 911 call was\r\nnot acting as a witness, she was not testifying, and what she said was not \"a weaker\r\nsubstitute for live testimony\" at trial. Id. at 828. Accordingly, her statements\r\nidentifying Davis as her assailant were not testimonial. Id. at 829.4\r\n\r\nApplying the law to the facts in Hammon, however, led the USSC to conclude the\r\nstatements in that case were testimonial in nature. Id. at 830. It found \"it [was]\r\nentirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation [in Hammon] was part\r\nof an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct — as, indeed, the testifying\r\nofficer expressly acknowledged.\" Id. at 829. The USSC noted no emergency was\r\nin progress at the time the statements were made, when the officers first arrived the\r\nvictim told them things were fine, and when the officer questioned the victim a\r\nsecond time eliciting the challenged statements, \"he was not seeking to determine\r\n(as in Davis) 'what is happening,' but rather 'what happened.'\" Id. at 829-30.\r\nViewed objectively, the primary purpose of the interrogation in Hammon was to\r\ninvestigate a possible crime. Id. at 830. Additionally, the USSC noted, though the\r\ninterrogation in Crawford was more formal, being tape-recorded at the station\r\nhouse following Miranda5 warnings, the wife's interrogation in Hammon was\r\nnonetheless \"formal enough\" as it was conducted in a separate room, \"away from\r\nher husband (who tried to intervene), with the officer receiving her replies for use\r\n\r\n4 It should be noted the USSC also cautioned that a conversation which begins as\r\nan interrogation to determine the need for emergency assistance may at some point\r\nevolve into testimonial statements once the emergency assistance purpose has been\r\nachieved. Id. at 828.\r\n5 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\nin his 'investigation.'\" Id. Comparing the circumstances in Hammon to those in\r\nCrawford, the USSC noted as follows: (1) both declarants were actively separated\r\nfrom the defendant; (2) both statements deliberately recounted, in response to\r\npolice questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed; and\r\n(3) both took place some time after the events described were over. Id.\r\nAccordingly, the USSC held \"[s]uch statements under official interrogation are an\r\nobvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely what a witness\r\ndoes on direct examination; they are inherently testimonial.\" Id. Notably, the\r\ncourt declined to hold \"no questions at the scene will yield nontestimonial\r\nanswers,\" as officers called to investigate need to know whom they are dealing\r\nwith so they might assess the situation, the threat to their safety, and any possible\r\ndanger to a potential victim. Id. at 832. Thus, such exigencies may result in initial\r\ninquiries which produce nontestimonial statements. Id. However, in cases such as\r\nHammon, where the \"statements were neither a cry for help nor the provision of\r\ninformation enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation, the fact\r\nthat they were given at an alleged crime scene and were 'initial inquiries' is\r\nimmaterial.\" Id.\r\n\r\n   C. Michigan v. Bryant\r\n\r\nIn 2011, the USSC issued another opinion addressing whether statements made to\r\npolice after officers responded to an incident constituted testimonial evidence. In\r\nMichigan v. Bryant, ___, U.S.___, ___, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (2011), the USSC further\r\nexamined the primary-purpose test, expounding on the \"ongoing emergency\"\r\ndiscussed in Davis. Id. at 1156.\r\n\r\nIn Bryant, police officers responding to a radio dispatch found a man lying in a gas\r\nstation parking lot, suffering from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Id. at 1150.\r\nThe victim subsequently died of his wounds; however, before he was removed\r\nfrom the scene, officers were able to speak with him for five to ten minutes, asking\r\nhim, \"'what had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had\r\noccurred.'\" Id. During that discussion, the victim was able to tell officers that\r\nBryant had shot him and was able to relate when and where the shooting occurred.\r\nId. At Bryant's trial, officers were allowed to repeat in court what the victim had\r\ntold them about the incident. Id. Bryant argued the victim's statements to police\r\nwere testimonial under Crawford and Davis and were therefore inadmissible, while\r\nthe prosecution argued the statements were admissible as excited utterances under\r\nthe Michigan Rules of Evidence. Id. at 1151. It was undisputed the victim was\r\nunavailable at trial and Bryant had not been afforded a prior opportunity to cross-\r\nexamine him. Id. The Supreme Court of Michigan concluded that the\r\n\ncircumstances clearly indicated that the \"primary purpose\" of the officers'\r\nquestioning was to establish the facts of an event that had already occurred, and\r\nwas not to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. Id. It therefore\r\nheld the admission of the victim's statements to police was reversible error. Id.\r\n\r\nThe USSC disagreed, holding that the circumstances of the interaction between the\r\nvictim and the police objectively indicated that the primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency and,\r\naccordingly, the victim's identification and description of the shooter and the\r\nlocation of the shooting were not testimonial statements, such that their admission\r\nat trial did not violate Bryant's Confrontation Clause rights. Id. at 1150. In further\r\nanalyzing which police interrogations produce testimony, thereby implicating a\r\nConfrontation Clause bar, the court first noted that not all those questioned by\r\npolice are witnesses and not all interrogations by them are subject to the\r\nConfrontation Clause. Id. at 1153. It also noted \"the most important instances in\r\nwhich the Clause restricts the introduction of out-of-court statements are those in\r\nwhich state actors are involved in a formal, out-of-court interrogation of a witness\r\nto obtain evidence for trial.\" Id. at 1155. Additionally, the court observed there\r\nmay be circumstances, aside from ongoing emergencies, when a statement is not\r\nprocured with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial\r\ntestimony, and \"[i]n making the primary purpose determination, standard rules of\r\nhearsay, designed to identify some statements as reliable, will be relevant.\" Id.\r\n\"Where no such primary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the\r\nconcern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe USSC clarified an objective evaluation is the proper means to determine the\r\nmatter stating, \"To determine whether the 'primary purpose' of an interrogation is\r\n'to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,' . . . which would\r\nrender the resulting statements nontestimonial, we objectively evaluate the\r\ncircumstances in which the encounter occurs and the statements and actions of the\r\nparties.\" Id. at 1156 (citation omitted). The court emphasized that the relevant\r\ninquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals, but \"the purpose\r\nthat reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals'\r\nstatements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\"\r\nId. Among the most important circumstances to consider in determining the\r\nprimary purpose of the interrogation is whether there exists an ongoing emergency\r\nat the time of the encounter between the declarant and the police. 6 Id. at 1157.\r\n\r\n6Such is relevant because an emergency focuses the participants on something\r\nother than an attempt to prove past events which may be potentially relevant to\r\n\n\"[W]hether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent\r\ninquiry.\" Id. at 1158.\r\n\r\nThe USSC also recognized that domestic violence cases have a narrower zone of\r\npotential victims than those situations involving threats to public safety, and\r\nbecause Davis and Hammon were domestic violence cases, the court \"focused only\r\non the threat to the victims and assessed the ongoing emergency from the\r\nperspective of whether there was a continuing threat to them.\" Id. However, it\r\nconcluded \"[a]n assessment of whether an emergency that threatens the police and\r\npublic is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat solely to the first\r\nvictim has been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public\r\nmay continue.\" Id. Noting \"the duration and scope of an emergency may depend\r\nin part on the type of weapon employed,\" the court distinguished Davis and\r\nHammon on the basis that those cases involved the use of fists by the assailant,\r\nwhile the emergency in Bryant involved the use of a gun. Id. However, it further\r\nnoted, had Hammon been reported to be \"armed with a gun,\" separation of him\r\nfrom the victim by a single household wall might not have been sufficient to end\r\nthe emergency. Id. at 1159.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the USSC again recognized that there are limitations as to whether an\r\nemergency is ongoing, noting a conversation which may begin as interrogation to\r\ndetermine the need for emergency assistance may evolve into testimonial\r\nstatements, which portions should be excluded from evidence. Id.\r\n\r\n             This evolution may occur if, for example, a declarant\r\n             provides police with information that makes clear that\r\n             what appeared to be an emergency is not or is no longer\r\n             an emergency or that what appeared to be a public threat\r\n             is actually a private dispute. It could also occur if a\r\n             perpetrator is disarmed, surrenders, is apprehended, or, as\r\n\r\n\r\nlater criminal prosecution. Id. \"[B]ecause the prospect of fabrication in statements\r\ngiven for the primary purpose of resolving that emergency is presumably\r\nsignificantly diminished, the Confrontation Clause does not require such\r\nstatements to be subject to the crucible of cross-examination.\" Id. The court\r\nlikened this logic to that justifying the excited utterance exception in hearsay law,\r\nnoting excited utterances \"are considered reliable because the declarant, in the\r\nexcitement, presumably cannot form a falsehood,\" and an ongoing emergency has\r\na similar effect of focusing attention on response to the emergency. Id.\r\n\n             in Davis, flees with little prospect of posing a threat to\r\n             the public.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nThe USSC also made clear that whether or not an ongoing emergency exists is not\r\ndispositive of the testimonial inquiry, but is simply a factor to be considered, albeit\r\nan important one. Id. at 1160. Another factor to consider is the informality of the\r\nencounter between a victim and police. Id. Observing that the questioning in\r\nBryant \"occurred in an exposed, public area, prior to the arrival of emergency\r\nmedical services, and in a disorganized fashion,\" the court determined those facts\r\nmade Bryant distinguishable from the formal station-house interrogation in\r\nCrawford. Id.\r\n\r\nNext the court observed, beyond the circumstances in which the encounter occurs,\r\n\"the statements and actions of both the declarant and interrogators provide\r\nobjective evidence of the primary purpose of the interrogation.\" Id. The court\r\nemphasized that a combined inquiry that accounts for the actions and statements of\r\nboth the declarant and the interrogator is required, with the primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation often being most accurately determined by looking at the contents of\r\nthe questions and the answers. Id. at 1160-61.\r\n\r\nThe court ultimately summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n             As we suggested in Davis, when a court must determine\r\n             whether the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a\r\n             statement at trial, it should determine the \"primary\r\n             purpose of the interrogation\" by objectively evaluating\r\n             the statements and actions of the parties to the encounter,\r\n             in light of the circumstances in which the interrogation\r\n             occurs. The existence of an emergency or the parties'\r\n             perception that an emergency is ongoing is among the\r\n             most important circumstances that courts must take into\r\n             account in determining whether an interrogation is\r\n             testimonial because statements made to assist police in\r\n             addressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the\r\n             testimonial purpose that would subject them to the\r\n             requirement of confrontation. As the context of this case\r\n             brings into sharp relief, the existence and duration of an\r\n\n             emergency depend on the type and scope of danger posed\r\n             to the victim, the police, and the public.\r\n\r\nId. at 1162 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nApplying this analysis to the facts in Bryant, the USSC concluded \"the\r\ncircumstances of the encounter as well as the statements and actions of [the\r\ndeclarant] and the police objectively indicate[d] that the 'primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation' was 'to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,'\"\r\nsuch that the victim's identification and description of his assailant and the location\r\nof the shooting were not testimonial hearsay and were not barred by the\r\nConfrontation Clause. Id. at 1166-67. In so finding, the court noted as follows:\r\n\r\nAs to the circumstances in which the encounter occurred, the court found the\r\npotential scope of the dispute, and therefore the emergency, in Bryant stretched\r\nmore broadly than that in the domestic disturbance cases of Davis and Hammon,\r\nencompassing a potential threat to the police and the public. Id. at 1163-64.\r\nAdditionally, Bryant involved the use of a gun, and while physical separation was\r\nsufficient to end the threat in Hammon, it did not necessarily end the threat in\r\nBryant. Id. at 1164. Importantly, the court reiterated that \"the existence vel non of\r\nan ongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial inquiry; rather, the\r\nultimate inquiry is whether the 'primary purpose of the interrogation [was] to\r\nenable police assistance to meet [the] ongoing emergency.'\" Id. at 1165 (quoting\r\nDavis, 547 U.S. at 822).\r\n\r\nReviewing the statements and actions of the declarant the court noted, from the\r\ndescription of the victim's condition and report of his statements, it could not say\r\nthat the primary purpose of a person in such a situation would be to establish or\r\nprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. Id. As to the\r\nofficers' statements and actions, the court observed the questions they asked —\r\nwhat happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred — were\r\nof the type necessary to allow the officers to access the situation, the threat to their\r\nsafety, and the possible danger to the victim as well as the public. Id. at 1166. \"In\r\nother words, they solicited the information necessary to enable them 'to meet an\r\nongoing emergency.'\" Id.\r\n\r\nFinally, in considering the informality of the situation and the interrogation, the\r\nUSSC found the situation in Bryant to be more similar to the \"harried 911 call in\r\nDavis than the structured, station-house interview in Crawford,\" with \"[t]he\r\ninformality suggest[ing] that the interrogators' primary purpose was simply to\r\n\naddress what they perceived to be an ongoing emergency, and the circumstances\r\nlack[ing] any formality that would have alerted [the declarant] to or focused him\r\non the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.\" Id.\r\n\r\nBased upon this analysis, the USSC held the circumstances of the encounter and\r\nstatements and actions of the declarant and interrogators in Bryant objectively\r\nindicated the primary purpose of the interrogation was to enable police assistance\r\nto meet an ongoing emergency. Id. at 1166-67. Accordingly, the declarant's\r\nstatements were nontestimonial and therefore were not barred by the Confrontation\r\nClause. Id. at 1167.\r\n\r\n   III.   Application of Law to the Facts\r\n\r\nAs a threshold matter we agree with Haygood that the circuit court erred in finding\r\nthe testimonial statements made by the victim to the police did not violate the\r\nConfrontation Clause because the statements fell within the excited utterance\r\nexception to hearsay. Though the circuit court stated in its order that Haygood\r\n\"claim[ed] that this statement should be excluded based on the fact that it is\r\nhearsay,\" the record is clear that trial counsel twice argued to the circuit court that\r\nhearsay was not the issue the defense was raising, but it was arguing\r\ninadmissibility based on Crawford. Further, Crawford plainly provides that a\r\nstatement which may qualify as admissible hearsay may otherwise be rendered\r\ninadmissible by the Confrontation Clause if it is testimonial in nature. See\r\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 68. (\"Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly\r\nconsistent with the Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their\r\ndevelopment of hearsay law. . . . Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however,\r\nthe Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and\r\na prior opportunity for cross-examination.\"); id. at 56 n.7 (\"Involvement of\r\ngovernment officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial\r\npresents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse — a fact borne out time and again\r\nthroughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar. This\r\nconsideration does not evaporate when testimony happens to fall within some\r\nbroad, modern hearsay exception, even if that exception might be justifiable in\r\nother circumstances.\"). Additionally, Hammon illustrates although a statement\r\nmay be considered admissible as an excited utterance exception to the rule against\r\nhearsay, that exception will not save it from inadmissibility if otherwise barred by\r\nthe Confrontation Clause. See Hammon, 547 U.S. at 820, 821 (\"It is the\r\ntestimonial character of the statement that separates it from other hearsay that,\r\nwhile subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not subject to the\r\nConfrontation Clause.\"). Indeed, while the State appears to have taken the position\r\n\nbefore the circuit court that the statements in this matter did not offend the\r\nConfrontation Clause because they qualified as excited utterances, it does not\r\ncontinue to take this stance on appeal.7 Rather, it recognizes the paramount\r\nquestion is whether the statements made by the victim were testimonial, and\r\nmaintains only testimonial statements require compliance with the Confrontation\r\nClause while nontestimonial statements are generally admissible, subject to\r\ntraditional limitations on hearsay evidence. Though a statement's qualification as\r\nan excited utterance is relevant in making the primary purpose determination, it is\r\nbut a consideration. See Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1155 (\"In making the primary\r\npurpose determination, standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some\r\nstatements as reliable, will be relevant.\"). Thus, if the statements in question are in\r\nfact testimonial, they were erroneously found to be admissible by the circuit court\r\nbased simply on a finding they qualified as an excited utterance exception to the\r\nrule against hearsay.\r\n\r\nAs well, we agree with Haygood that the circuit court erred in distinguishing this\r\ncase from Crawford on the bases that the statement in Crawford (1) was taken in a\r\ncustodial interrogation and (2) was not an excited utterance. First, the fact that the\r\nstatements here were not taken at a police station during custodial interrogation,\r\nalthough a proper factor to consider, is not dispositive. See Davis, 547 U.S. at 827\r\n(considering the difference in the level of formality between the interview in the\r\nstation house in Crawford and the frantic 911 call in Davis as one of the factors in\r\ndetermining whether the statements from the 911 call were testimonial); Hammon,\r\n547 U.S. at 830 (recognizing the Crawford interrogation was more formal, but\r\ndetermining the interrogation of Hammon's wife was \"formal enough\" in\r\nconsidering that factor and determining the wife's statements were testimonial);\r\nBryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1166-67 (considering the informality of the situation and the\r\ninterrogation as one of the factors in objectively evaluating the statements and\r\nactions of the parties to determine the primary purpose of the interrogation in\r\ndeciding whether the Confrontation Clause bars admission of a statement). Davis,\r\nHammon, and Bryant demonstrate Crawford may apply to prohibit statements\r\nregardless of whether statements are made to police in a custodial interrogation or\r\noutside of such confines. Second, absolutely nothing in Crawford limits its\r\napplication to statements previously admitted based upon them bearing a\r\nparticularized guarantee of trustworthiness. Indeed, the language in Crawford\r\nindicates that consideration of whether the Confrontation Clause is implicated does\r\nnot evaporate simply because testimony happens to \"fall within some broad,\r\n\r\n7The State conceded at oral argument that, even if the statements qualified as\r\nexcited utterances, they would be inadmissible if found to be testimonial in nature.\r\n\nmodern hearsay exception.\" Crawford, 541 U.S. at 56. Further, the Hammon case\r\nestablishes the decision in Crawford expressly applies to the sort of statements\r\nmade here, i.e., those found admissible based upon the excited utterance exception.\r\nThus, the USSC did not seek to limit the provision of the Confrontation Clause by\r\nchallenging only statements that bore a particularized guarantee of trustworthiness.\r\nAccordingly, we agree with Haygood that the circuit court erred in distinguishing\r\nthis case from Crawford on the bases that the statement in Crawford was taken in a\r\ncustodial interrogation and it did not involve an excited utterance. While such\r\ncircumstances may be appropriate to consider in making an objective\r\ndetermination of the primary purpose of an interrogation in order to determine\r\nwhether a statement is testimonial or nontestimonial, they are not dispositive of the\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nTurning to the ultimate issue before us — whether the victim's statements are\r\ntestimonial or nontestimonial — we note analysis of the case at hand is hampered\r\nby the fact that, not only do we not have available the specific questions and\r\nanswers between the victim and Lt. Jenkins, we have only a summary of testimony\r\nfrom Lt. Jenkins as to what the victim said to him and little other information of\r\nthe circumstances under which the statements were made. As noted by the State,\r\nthe limited record before us makes it difficult to ascertain the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the encounter between the victim and the officer. However, upon\r\nconsidering the restricted scenario before us,8 we find it sufficiently demonstrates\r\nthe statements made by the victim were testimonial, and because there is no\r\nevidence the victim was unavailable and no evidence Haygood ever had the\r\nopportunity to cross-examine the victim, the admission of the statements violated\r\nHaygood's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the law, statements are \"testimonial when the circumstances\r\nobjectively indicate that there is no . . . ongoing emergency, and that the primary\r\npurpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant\r\nto later criminal prosecution,\" while they are considered nontestimonial \"when\r\nmade in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively\r\nindicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police\r\n\r\n8 See Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1162-63 (noting the court was hampered in applying\r\nanalysis to the facts of that case because (1) it did not have the luxury of reviewing\r\na transcript of the conversation between police and the victim and (2) the pre-\r\nCrawford and Davis trial provided a record that had not been developed to\r\nascertain the primary purpose of the interrogation, but nonetheless making the\r\ndetermination of its nontestimonial nature based upon the record before it).\r\n\nassistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\" Davis and Hammon, 547 U.S. at 822.\r\nFurther, Bryant edifies that \"[t]o determine whether the 'primary purpose' of an\r\ninterrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency, which\r\nwould render the resulting statements nontestimonial, we objectively evaluate the\r\ncircumstances in which the encounter occurs and the statements and actions of the\r\nparties.\" 131 S.Ct. at 1156 (citation omitted). The relevant inquiry is not the\r\nsubjective or actual purpose of the individuals, but \"the purpose that reasonable\r\nparticipants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals' statements and\r\nactions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\" Id. Among the\r\nmost important circumstances to consider in determining the primary purpose of\r\nthe interrogation is whether there exists an ongoing emergency at the time of the\r\nencounter between the declarant and the police, and whether or not such an\r\nemergency exists and is ongoing \"is a highly context-dependent inquiry.\" Id. at\r\n1157, 1158. There are limitations as to whether an emergency is ongoing, as a\r\nconversation which may begin as interrogation to determine the need for\r\nemergency assistance may evolve into testimonial statements. Id. at 1159.\r\nFurther, whether or not an ongoing emergency exists, although an important factor,\r\nis simply one factor to be considered in determining the primary purpose of an\r\ninterrogation and is not dispositive of the testimonial inquiry. Id. at 1160. \"[T]he\r\nexistence vel non of an ongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial\r\ninquiry; rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether the 'primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation [was] to enable police assistance to meet [the] ongoing\r\nemergency.'\" Id. at 1165 (emphasis added) (quoting Davis, 547 U.S. at 822).\r\n\r\nObjectively evaluating the circumstances in which the encounter occurred between\r\nthe victim and Lt. Jenkins and the statements and actions of the victim and Lt.\r\nJenkins, we find the primary purpose of the interrogation was not to enable Lt.\r\nJenkins's assistance in order to meet an ongoing emergency but, rather, was to\r\nprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nUnlike Davis, the case at hand does not involve a 911 call, which is traditionally\r\ndesigned, not to prove or establish some fact from the past, \"but to describe current\r\ncircumstances requiring police assistance.\" Davis, 547 U.S. 827. We cannot say,\r\nas the USSC did in Davis, that any reasonable listener would recognize from the\r\nstatements made by the victim at hand that she was facing an ongoing emergency\r\nor that the her statements were a plea for help \"against a bona fide physical threat.\"\r\nId. Though the restricted record before us does not give us the benefit of knowing\r\nspecifically what questions were asked by Lt. Jenkins and what the victim\r\nanswered, the testimony of Lt. Jenkins does not demonstrate, as it did in Davis,\r\nthat the elicited answers of the victim were necessary to resolve a present\r\n\nemergency. Rather, the nature of the statements tend to indicate the information\r\nwas elicited in order for Lt. Jenkins \"simply to learn (as in Crawford) what had\r\nhappened in the past.\" Id. Additionally, while we agree with the State that, based\r\nupon the imperfect record, it is difficult to ascertain the level of formality involved\r\nbetween Lt. Jenkins and the victim, there is nothing to suggest the victim here was\r\nfrantic in speaking with Lt. Jenkins or that the environment was unsafe at the time\r\nthe victim made her statements, as was the case in Davis. Id.\r\n\r\nThough, as the State observes, Lt. Jenkins testified the victim was visibly upset\r\nwhen he arrived at the scene, there is simply no indication she remained in that\r\nstate when she made the statements in question or that her statements were a cry\r\nfor help. Notably, the victim in Hammon was characterized as \"somewhat\r\nfrightened\" upon the arrival of the police, yet the USSC ultimately found her\r\nstatements to be testimonial. Hammon, 547 U.S. at 819. The State also places\r\nmuch emphasis on the fact that Lt. Jenkins testified Haygood was highly\r\nintoxicated when he arrived on the scene, was hostile toward the officer, and told\r\nthe officer \"this was his house and that he would do anything he wishes.\" It is not\r\nclear at what point these maters occurred in relation to the victim's interview by the\r\nofficer and under what circumstances, thus it is difficult to say whether these\r\nmatters lend support to the State's assertion that they indicated the domestic\r\ndisturbance was ongoing. At any rate, we note the facts in Hammon likewise\r\ndemonstrated some hostile and belligerent behavior by the husband when he\r\nattempted to participate in the victim's conversation with the police and became\r\nangry after he was rebuffed and separated from the victim. Id. at 819-20.\r\n\r\nFurther, we do not believe Bryant requires a finding that the statements in the case\r\nat hand were nontestimonial. First, unlike Bryant, this matter involved a domestic\r\ndispute, which the USSC in Bryant recognized is typically more limited in the\r\nscope of the emergency in terms of the threat to individuals other than the initial\r\nvictim. Bryant, 131 S.Ct. 1158, 1163. The State, however, points to the fact that a\r\ngun was involved in this situation, asserting the scope of the emergency was\r\nheightened because the police found a gun in Haygood's possession. While Bryant\r\nrecognized the involvement of a gun may create a continuing threat even in a\r\ndomestic situation, as separation of the parties in a domestic matter by a single\r\nhousehold wall might not be sufficient to end the emergency, id. at 1158-59, 1164,\r\nthere is nothing in the record before us to indicate Haygood was actually armed\r\nwith a gun at the time the police arrived, much less that he was in possession of\r\nsuch while the victim was giving her statement. Indeed, the record shows only\r\nthat, while Haygood retrieved a shotgun during the dispute with the victim, the\r\nteenage son struggled with him to take the shotgun away, and though the victim\r\n\nknew Haygood kept a small handgun in his pocket \"at times,\" when he reached in\r\nhis pocket the victim grabbed the pocket causing small bullets, not a gun, to fall to\r\nthe floor. At that point, Haygood went outside and then returned to punch a hole in\r\nthe closet. Thus, there is no evidence, as the State suggests, that Haygood was\r\narmed with a gun at the time the police arrived at the residence such that any\r\nemergency had not yet ended. Indeed, under the evidence of record, while\r\nHaygood may have attempted to arm himself with a shotgun, the teenage son\r\nstruggled with him to take the shotgun away during the incident. Simply put, there\r\nis nothing in the narrative to indicate there was any perceived danger from\r\nHaygood at the time the victim's statements were made to Lt. Jenkins. From the\r\nreport of the victim's statements in this case, we cannot say that a person in her\r\nsituation would have had a primary purpose of anything other than \"establish[ing]\r\nor prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\" Id. at\r\n1165.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, though certainly not as formal as the station-house interview in\r\nCrawford, neither did the matter at hand involve a \"harried 911 call\" as in Davis,\r\nor the \"fluid,\" and \"somewhat confused,\" situation with the \"[un]structured\r\ninterrogation\" that occurred in Bryant. Id. at 1166. Rather, based upon the\r\ncircumstances in this case, it appears, like the situation in Hammon, the\r\ninterrogation was \"formal enough.\" Hammon, 547 U.S. 830. Though it is not clear\r\nwhether or not the victim here was actively separated from Haygood as she spoke\r\nto Lt. Jenkins about the matter, there is nothing to indicate she or anyone else was\r\nin any danger. Rather, it appears from the context of the situation that the victim\r\n\"deliberately recounted\" for the officer \"how potentially criminal past events began\r\nand progressed.\" Id.\r\n\r\nFinally, the State correctly notes that the USSC in Bryant likened the underlying\r\nrationale for considering the existence vel non of an ongoing emergency as one of\r\nthe most important factors in determining the primary purpose of an interrogation\r\nas being similar to that justifying the excited utterance exception to the rule against\r\nhearsay. Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1157. From this, the State extrapolates that the\r\nmagistrate's determination that the victim's statements were admissible under the\r\nexcited utterance exception \"illustrates the freshness of the domestic disturbance.\"\r\nFirst, as previously noted, the fact that a statement may qualify as an excited\r\nutterance will not necessarily save it from exclusion under the Confrontation\r\nClause. Further, there is absolutely no indication in the record that the police\r\narrived and took the victim's statement very shortly after the domestic incident\r\noccurred. Thus, while the victim may have still been \"under the stress of\r\n\nexcitement caused by the event or condition,\"9 this does not necessarily indicate\r\nthat the incident occurred immediately prior to the officer's arrival or that an\r\nemergency was ongoing at that point. Finally, even assuming arguendo that its\r\nqualification as an excited utterance is an indication of how \"fresh\" the statement\r\nis, the relationship in time between the domestic incident and the statement is\r\ncertainly but one of the considerations in determining the context in which the\r\nvictim made her statements to the police.\r\n\r\nWe find the case at hand is more similar to that of Hammon, wherein the\r\ninterrogation occurred after police responded to the scene following a domestic\r\ndisturbance. Most tellingly, we note the magistrate's return reflects that Lt. Jenkins\r\n\"testified as to what took place during his initial investigation after he responded to\r\nan alleged CDV call,\" and that \"during his investigation\" the victim made the\r\nstatements relating \"what [Haygood] did on the date [in] question.\" Additionally,\r\nthe return acknowledges it was the State's position that it was the officer's duty,\r\nupon being dispatched to the alleged CDV incident, \"to do an investigation of the\r\nincident and be prepared to testify as to the facts (during his investigation) at trial,\"\r\nand that the magistrate agreed with the State that in some CDV cases, the\r\n\"investigating officer . . . should be allowed to testify as to the finding of facts\r\nduring his investigation.\" Thus the return indicates the statements from the victim\r\nwere elicited as a result of Lt. Jenkins' investigation of the matter. Contrarily, there\r\nis nothing in the return to specifically indicate any of the statements were made in\r\norder to enable Lt. Jenkins to respond to or resolve a present emergency or\r\nthreatening situation. The State cites to notations in the return's summary of\r\ntestimony indicating Haygood was belligerent and intoxicated, and the victim was\r\nhighly upset; however, these matters do not necessarily evince an ongoing\r\nemergency and the summary does not relate any such emergency. Further, though\r\nthe State also maintains the return shows Haygood had been armed with one, and\r\npossibly two, guns, it does not indicate Haygood was still in possession of a\r\nweapon at the time the police arrived or that Lt. Jenkins had to disarm him.\r\nMoreover, the summary of Lt. Jenkins' testimony as to the victim's statements is a\r\nrecitation of how Haygood's potentially past criminal behavior began and\r\nprogressed, thus acting as a substitute for live testimony of the victim. Though the\r\nState asserts the primary purpose of the interrogation was to enable police\r\n\r\n9 See Rule 803(2), SCRE (providing an excited utterance is \"[a] statement relating\r\nto a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of\r\nexcitement caused by the event or condition\").\r\n\nassistance to meet an ongoing emergency, its characterization of it as such simply\r\ndoes not make it so. See id. at 832 n.6 (\"While prosecutors may hope that\r\ninculpatory \"nontestimonial\" evidence is gathered, this is essentially beyond police\r\ncontrol. Their saying that an emergency exists cannot make it be so. The\r\nConfrontation Clause in no way governs police conduct, because it is the trial use\r\nof, not the investigatory collection of, ex parte testimonial statements which\r\noffends that provision. But neither can police conduct govern the Confrontation\r\nClause; testimonial statements are what they are.\"). We find the primary purpose\r\nof the interrogation — resulting in the victim's statements — was to investigate a\r\npossible crime. See id. at 829 (\"It is entirely clear from the circumstances that the\r\ninterrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct — as,\r\nindeed, the testifying officer expressly acknowledged.\").\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after review of the record before us, we conclude an objective\r\nevaluation of the circumstances in which the encounter occurred as well as the\r\nstatements and actions of the parties indicates the primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation was not to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\r\nRather, the primary purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible\r\ncrime, and the victim's statements to Lt. Jenkins are \"an obvious substitute for live\r\ntestimony, because they do precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\"\r\nId. at 830. We therefore hold the victim's statements in this matter were\r\ntestimonial, and because there is nothing to indicate the declarant was not\r\nunavailable to testify at trial and the accused did not have a prior opportunity to\r\ncross-examine the declarant, admission of the statements violated Haygood's Sixth\r\nAmendment right to confrontation. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse Haygood's conviction and remand for a new\r\ntrial consistent with this court's opinion. We recognize the difficulties the State\r\noften encounters in prosecuting CDV cases. As noted by the USSC in Davis and\r\nHammon, domestic abuse crimes are \"notoriously susceptible to intimidation or\r\ncoercion of the victim to ensure that she does not testify at trial,\" and when this\r\noccurs, the offender reaps a windfall from the Confrontation Clause. 547 U.S. at\r\n832-33. Nonetheless, our courts \"may not . . . vitiate constitutional guarantees\"\r\nbecause they may \"have the effect of allowing the guilty to go free.\" Id. at 833.\r\nTherefore, we are constrained to reverse Haygood's conviction based on the\r\nerroneous admission of the inherently testimonial statements of his wife to the\r\nofficer.\r\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., concurs in result only.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: I concur in the result reached in the majority opinion to reverse\r\nHaygood's conviction and remand for a new trial. I would reverse and remand\r\nexclusively on the grounds that the court erred in distinguishing this case from\r\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), and subsequently failing to make a\r\ndetermination as to whether the victim's statements were testimonial or\r\nnontestimonial. While I am aware that an appellate court may engage in a\r\nCrawford analysis10, I do not believe this court can perform such an analysis here\r\ngiven the summary of the testimony11 and the lack of findings by the magistrate\r\nand the circuit court as to this issue. See State v. Ladson, 373 S.C. 320, 327-28,\r\n644 S.E.2d 271, 275 (Ct. App. 2007) (reversing and remanding for a new trial\r\nwhere the record \"lack[ed] the completeness and reliability necessary for this court\r\nto engage in meaningful appellate review\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 See State v. Ladner, 373 S.C. 103, 114-15, 644 S.E.2d 684, 689-90 (2007)\r\n(finding a statement nontestimonial under Crawford).\r\n11 The proceedings in magistrate's court were electronically recorded pursuant to\r\nsection 22-3-790 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013). However, Haygood's\r\ntrial counsel informed the circuit court that upon requesting a copy of the\r\nrecording, she was told the recording was no longer available. Therefore, the only\r\ntestimony from the trial in magistrate's court that we have before us is the\r\nmagistrate's summary of the proceedings.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
