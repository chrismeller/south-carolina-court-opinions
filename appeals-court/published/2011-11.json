Walsh, of Greenville, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.: After the parties' divorce, the family\r\n  court entered an order awarding custody of the parties' minor child, S.R., to David\r\n  R. (Father) but provisionally placing her with Sheila R. (Mother).Â  The family\r\n  court later awarded Father &quot;primary physical placement&quot; as well as legal\r\n  custody.Â  Mother appeals, arguing the family court erred in (1) using its own standard to determine who should receive\r\n  custody of S.R. and failing to conduct a best-interests analysis when it\r\n  subsequently granted Father full custody and (2) failing to appoint a guardian\r\n  ad litem (Guardian) or consider S.R.'s wishes when determining custody. Â On appeal, Mother also argues the family court lacked\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction over the custody issue at the time of the issuance\r\n  of its 2009 order.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father married in 1987 and had two daughters.Â  H.R. was\r\n  born June 5, 1990, and S.R. was born July 20, 1995.Â  In July 2005, Mother filed\r\n  a complaint seeking separate support and maintenance, equitable apportionment\r\n  of the marital estate, and custody of both children.Â  Father answered and\r\n  counterclaimed for the same relief but also petitioned the family court to\r\n  appoint a Guardian for the children and to require Mother to undergo a\r\n  psychological examination.Â  \r\nIn September 2005, the family court entered a temporary order\r\n  appointing Debra L. Walsh as the children's Guardian, ordering the parties and\r\n  children to undergo psychological evaluations by Dr. Craig Horne, temporarily placing\r\n  both children with Mother and allowing Father visitation, and permitting the\r\n  parties to engage in discovery.Â  In a subsequent order, the family court removed\r\n  H.R. from Mother's custody and placed her with Father.Â  \r\nIn September 2006, the Guardian served her report, which cited\r\n  more than one hundred resources and spanned seventy-six pages.Â  The Guardian recorded\r\n  her observations about both parents and both children in great detail.Â  The\r\n  Guardian did not recommend either parent receive custody of the children but\r\n  instead expressed concern that both parents &quot;demonstrate[d] signs of\r\n  unresolved anger[] and an inability to accept full responsibility for their own\r\n  actions.&quot;Â  According to the Guardian, Father regarded himself as superior\r\n  to Mother, and Mother refused to address unresolved issues from her childhood\r\n  that appeared to affect her parenting.Â  Each parent shared with the children inappropriate\r\n  information about the ongoing conflict and tended to make the non-resident\r\n  child feel uncomfortable in his or her home.Â  While Father demonstrated an even\r\n  and patient temperament, he undertook to manipulate those around him by\r\n  controlling the information available to the Guardian and others and may have\r\n  engaged in some physical confrontations with the children.Â  While Mother orally\r\n  expressed a desire to raise both children, she sought custody of only S.R., in\r\n  whom she encouraged infantile behaviors.Â  In addition, Mother expressed\r\n  interest in Father's severing contact with S.R. as Mother had done with H.R.Â \r\n  Despite making extensive recommendations concerning the parties' and children's\r\n  future paths, the Guardian's sole recommendation concerning custody was that\r\n  the children &quot;should be in the custody of the parent most able to provide\r\n  them with an environment that allows them to be physically and emotionally\r\n  safe, and allowed to grow in to fully adult young women.&quot;Â  \r\nThe case was tried over five days in September 2007.Â  The family\r\n  court devoted more than ten pages of its final order to factual findings\r\n  concerning the parties', particularly Mother's, disturbing behavior, with\r\n  subsections devoted to the observations of Dr. Horne and the family court.Â \r\n  This order, dated November 29, 2007, granted Mother a divorce on the ground of\r\n  one year's continuous separation, divided the costs of suit between the\r\n  parties, and equitably apportioned the marital estate.Â  It established a\r\n  detailed visitation schedule, obligated Father to pay Mother both alimony and\r\n  child support, and relieved the Guardian from further responsibilities.Â  Notably\r\n  with regard to the issue of custody, the family court recognized Mother had\r\n  been the children's primary caretaker prior to the separation, was an involved\r\n  parent, exhibited adequate day-to-day parenting skills, and clearly loved the\r\n  children.Â  Nonetheless, the family court found Mother was &quot;not fit to have\r\n  custody of the children&quot; due to numerous demonstrations that she lacked appropriate\r\n  parental judgment in matters involving Father and failed to recognize the\r\n  negative impact her behavior had on the children.Â  \r\nAs a result of these complicated findings, the family court\r\n  awarded Father sole custody of both children but placed S.R. physically with\r\n  Mother.Â  In addition, the family court reserved jurisdiction over the issue of\r\n  S.R.'s custody for a period of eighteen months,[1] adopting a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach.Â  It further required Mother and\r\n  S.R. to complete Parent and Child Transition classes and all parties to undergo\r\n  family counseling.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed and argued motions for reconsideration.Â  On\r\n  July 8, 2008, the family court entered an order amending Father's financial\r\n  obligations to Mother, expanding Father's visitation with S.R., establishing\r\n  sibling visitation between H.R. and S.R., and denying all other relief.Â  Both\r\n  parties appealed from the November 2007 and July 2008 orders.Â  \r\nSubsequently, each party filed a complaint for contempt against\r\n  the other.Â  Six of Father's eight causes of action related to Mother's alleged\r\n  violations of the family court's orders concerning custody and visitation.Â \r\n  Mother's causes of action related to property issues.Â  \r\nOn June 5, 2009, following a trial, the family court entered an\r\n  order finding both parties in contempt of court, awarding Father primary\r\n  physical placement of S.R. effective immediately, and relinquishing its\r\n  reservation of jurisdiction over S.R.'s custody.[2]Â \r\n  The family court found Mother used S.R.'s physical placement with her to\r\n  prevent S.R. from engaging in the team sports in which Father had enrolled her\r\n  and to stop the sibling visitation ordered by the family court.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the family court found Mother's inflexibility and refusal to cooperate\r\n  undermined Father's healthcare decisions as legal custodian.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  order noted Mother refused to ensure S.R. cared for her teeth and pursued a\r\n  costly and questionably beneficial growth hormone treatment for S.R. over\r\n  Father's objection.Â  According to the family court, Mother's behavior\r\n  constituted a &quot;willful and wanton violation of the Final Order and was\r\n  done out of disregard for the Court's order and Father's authority.&quot;Â \r\n  Finally, the family court found Mother failed to comply, albeit not willfully,\r\n  with requirements that she deliver S.R. timely for visitation with Father.Â  The\r\n  family court reasoned giving Father both sole custody and primary physical placement\r\n  was in S.R.'s best interest:Â  \r\n\r\nThis action is made absolutely necessary because of the on-going\r\n  conflict between the Mother and the Father, who has legal custody, about the\r\n  medical necessity for growth hormone treatment for the child; and the lack of\r\n  cooperation of the Mother by not complying with the child's extra-curricular\r\n  activity schedules related to the swimming classes and the cross country\r\n  running team that she was enrolled in by the Father.\r\n\r\nThe family court\r\n  also re-appointed Walsh as Guardian to conduct further investigation into\r\n  &quot;whether the growth hormone treatment sought by Mother on behalf of [S.R.\r\n  was] necessary and in the best interest of the child.&quot; Â Mother appealed\r\n  from this order as well.[3]Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a decision by the family court, the appellate court has the authority\r\n  to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 384, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011).Â \r\n  This broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard\r\n  the findings of the family court.Â  Id. Â Neither is the appellate court\r\n  required to ignore the fact that the family court, which saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign\r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375,\r\n  380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34 (2004).Â  &quot;Because the family court is in a superior\r\n  position to judge the witnesses' demeanor and veracity, its findings should be\r\n  given broad discretion.&quot;Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579\r\n  S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; CUSTODY AND BEST\r\n  INTERESTS OF S.R.\r\nMother\r\n  first asserts the family court erred in using its own standard to determine who\r\n  should receive custody of S.R. and in failing to take S.R.'s best interests\r\n  into consideration when it subsequently granted Father full custody.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the child's\r\n  welfare and best interests. Â Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d\r\n  612, 614 (1978). Â In determining custody, the family court &quot;must consider\r\n  the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent\r\n  as they impact the child.&quot; Â Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471\r\n  S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Thus, when determining which parent shall receive\r\n  custody of a child, the family court &quot;must weigh all the conflicting rules\r\n  and presumptions together with all of the circumstances of each particular\r\n  case, and all relevant factors must be taken into consideration.&quot; Â Ford\r\n    v. Ford, 242 S.C. 344, 351, 130 S.E.2d 916, 921 (1963).Â  In other words, &quot;the\r\n  totality of the circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale\r\n  upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.&quot; Â Parris v. Parris,\r\n  319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1995).\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the family court's award to Father of full physical and legal custody of\r\n  S.R., because we believe it is clear the family court considered the peculiar\r\n  circumstances before it and based its decision upon a carefully conducted\r\n  best-interests analysis.Â  See Cook, 271 S.C. at 140, 245 S.E.2d\r\n  at 614 (recognizing the child's welfare and best interests are paramount in\r\n  deciding custody); Parris, 319 S.C. at 310, 460 S.E.2d at 572 (requiring\r\n  the family court deciding custody to evaluate the totality of the circumstances); Housand v. Housand, 333 S.C. 397, 400, 509 S.E.2d 827, 829 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998) (stating party seeking change in custody must demonstrate\r\n  &quot;sufficient facts &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to warrant the conclusion that the\r\n  best interest of the child will be served by the change&quot;).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  both the June 2009 order and the November 2007 order underlying it, the family\r\n  court painstakingly recorded explicit factual findings related to S.R.'s best\r\n  interests.Â  The June 2009 order cited Mother's refusal to transport S.R. to the\r\n  sporting activities in which Father had enrolled her, refusal to cooperate with\r\n  Father in caring for S.R.'s health, and inability to drop S.R. off timely\r\n  according to the court-ordered visitation schedule.Â  Concluding its factual\r\n  findings, the family court found awarding Father physical placement as well as\r\n  sole legal custody of S.R. was in S.R.'s best interest, was &quot;absolutely\r\n  necessary,&quot; and would provide an immediate remedy to the child-related\r\n  conflicts between Mother and Father.Â  The record fully supports both of these\r\n  findings and the decision to award Father full custody of S.R.Â  \r\nWe recognize\r\n  there is some incongruity in the family court's November 2007 order awarding placement\r\n  of S.R. to Mother in spite of its extensive findings regarding Mother's\r\n  unfitness and inability to foster a relationship between S.R. and Father, as\r\n  well as her otherwise poor judgment. Â Clearly, the family court would have been\r\n  fully justified in not placing S.R. with Mother initially.Â  In its November\r\n  2007 order, the family court described numerous disturbing incidents, including\r\n  Mother's unnecessary calls to law enforcement during Father's visits (such as\r\n  the call during S.R.'s tenth birthday party seeking removal of Father's mother\r\n  and another call during Father's visitation with S.R. seeking to have Father\r\n  and his brother removed from her home), Mother's report to the Guardian that\r\n  Father was &quot;on drugs,&quot;[4] and Mother's employment of celebratory signs and gifts to curry S.R.'s favor.Â \r\n  The family court cited with concern Dr. Horne's opinion that Mother and S.R.\r\n  were in danger of developing an &quot;enmeshed&quot; relationship in which\r\n  neither parent nor child could fully function independently of the other. Â All of\r\n  these findings militate in favor of limiting S.R.'s exposure to Mother.[5] Â Nevertheless, the court in this same order adopted a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach\r\n  to the &quot;custody of [S.R.]&quot; and provided for counseling for all the\r\n  parties for eighteen months. \r\nIn\r\n  view of these facts, the June 2009 order simply announced the family court's well-considered\r\n  conclusion that Mother continued to exhibit a pattern of inflexibility and\r\n  uncooperativeness in spite of the specific instructions and conditions the\r\n  family court had imposed on S.R.'s placement with her.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the family court's June 2009 grant to Father of physical and legal custody of S.R.\r\n  simply confirmed that the original arrangement, which gave Mother physical\r\n  placement of S.R. but Father legal custody of her, was not workable.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the reasons discussed above, we find unpersuasive Mother's argument that the\r\n  family court imposed its own standard on the custody determination, ignoring\r\n  S.R.'s best interests and effectively creating an impermissible local rule.Â \r\n  The family court was required to weigh &quot;all the conflicting rules and\r\n  presumptions . . . together with all of the circumstances of each particular\r\n  case&quot; and to consider &quot;all relevant factors.&quot;Â  Ford, 242\r\n  S.C. at 351, 130 S.E.2d at 921.Â  The facts identified by the family court, as\r\n  well as others set forth in the Guardian's exhaustive report, reveal a\r\n  complicated power struggle between Mother and Father, fueled by their religious\r\n  and social views and occasionally punctuated by acts of personal antagonism.Â \r\n  We find the family court conducted a thorough best-interests analysis,\r\n  considered the totality of the circumstances before it, and properly awarded sole\r\n  custody of S.R. to Father, with liberal visitation to Mother.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; GUARDIAN/CHILD'S\r\n  WISHES\r\nNext,\r\n  Mother asserts the family court erred in failing to appoint a Guardian or\r\n  consider S.R.'s wishes when determining custody. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  issue pertains only to the family court's June 2009 order, which mentions\r\n  neither a Guardian's custody recommendation nor S.R.'s wishes.[6]Â \r\n  Moreover, the record does not contain a transcript of the hearing upon which\r\n  that order was based, and Mother's 2009 complaint for contempt does not raise\r\n  this issue. Â Nevertheless, section 63-15-30 of the South Carolina Code (2010) requires\r\n  the family court to consider &quot;the child's reasonable preference for\r\n  custody . . . based upon the child's age, experience, maturity, judgment, and\r\n  ability to express a preference.&quot; Â &quot;The significance to be attached\r\n  to the wishes of [a child] in a custody dispute depends upon the age of the\r\n  child[] and the attendant circumstances.&quot;Â  Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C.\r\n  85, 93, 606 S.E.2d 785, 789 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in failing to appoint a Guardian or consider\r\n  S.R.'s preference as to custody.Â  With regard to S.R.'s wishes, S.R. was nearly fourteen years old at the time of the\r\n  June 2009 order and, therefore, old enough to form and communicate her own\r\n  desires regarding custody.Â  However, we find her age and circumstances weighed\r\n  heavily against considering her preference.Â  After conducting a thorough and\r\n  detailed investigation prior to the 2007 hearing, the Guardian reported to the\r\n  family court that Mother &quot;[i]ndulged, petted and infantilized&quot; S.R.,\r\n  while simultaneously subjecting S.R. to enormous pressure to view the parties\r\n  as adversaries and protect Mother.Â  The Guardian further noted S.R. responded to\r\n  Mother by becoming inappropriately clingy.Â  Both Dr. Horne and another witness\r\n  who interviewed the parties and their children expressed concern that the\r\n  relationship between Mother and S.R. was becoming enmeshed.Â  Dr. Horne specifically\r\n  recommended that the family court assign S.R.'s custody preference no weight.Â  In view of this evidence, we conclude that under the particular\r\n  circumstances present in this case, the family court did not err in failing to\r\n  consider S.R.'s preference as to custody.\r\nNo\r\n  basis existed for appointing a Guardian.Â  The family court did not make the\r\n  requisite finding that would have enabled it to involve a Guardian.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-810(A) (2010) (permitting appointment of a Guardian only after a\r\n  finding that the family court would\r\n  &quot;likely not be fully informed about the facts of the case and there is a\r\n  substantial dispute which necessitates a [G]uardian&quot;).Â  On appeal, Mother\r\n  argues a &quot;substantial dispute&quot; existed concerning S.R.'s health and\r\n  care.Â  The record reflects a substantial dispute existed between Mother and\r\n  Father concerning whose healthcare decisions should prevail, in spite of the\r\n  family court's order seating legal authority with Father.Â  The record does not\r\n  suggest any reason existed for the family court to believe it would not likely\r\n  be fully informed about the case without the further assistance of a Guardian.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the family court did not err in failing to appoint a Guardian\r\n  before placing S.R. with Father.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; SUBJECT MATTER\r\n  JURISDICTION\r\nAt\r\n  oral argument, Mother contended for the first time that the family court lacked\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to modify custody of S.R. in its June 2009 order.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised\r\n  for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.&quot;Â  Town of Hilton Head Island v. Godwin, 370 S.C. 221, 223, 634 S.E.2d 59,\r\n  60-61 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a\r\n  court to hear cases in the general class to which the proceedings in question\r\n  belong.&quot;Â  Altman v. Griffith, 372 S.C. 388, 396 n.2, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  619, 623 n.2 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C.\r\n  235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994)). Â The family court is a creature of\r\n  statute, and, as such, it is a court of limited jurisdiction.Â  State v.\r\n    Graham, 340 S.C. 352, 355, 532 S.E.2d 262, 263 (2000).Â  The family court\r\n  has jurisdiction over child custody disputes. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 63-3-510(A)(1)(e),\r\n  -530(A)(30) (2010).Â  \r\nMother\r\n  argued that, because the family court improperly placed its reservation of jurisdiction\r\n  in the portion of the November 2007 order devoted to factual findings and not\r\n  in the decree portion, the reservation was inoperative.Â  Even if this argument\r\n  were persuasive, it would not affect the family court's statutory authority to\r\n  hear and decide disputes over child custody.Â  See Â§Â§ 63-3-510(A)(1)(e),\r\n  -530(A)(30) (giving jurisdiction over child custody matters to the family\r\n  court).Â  Accordingly, the family court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  over any child custody determinations in 2009.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court conducted the proper best-interests analysis prior to\r\n  awarding Father both legal and physical custody of S.R.Â  We further find the family court did not err in failing to appoint a\r\n  Guardian or consider S.R.'s wishes when determining custody and placement. Â Finally, we find the family court did not lack\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction over S.R.'s custody.Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The order specified:Â  \r\n\r\nThe Court reserves its\r\n  jurisdiction to fully merge custody and placement with [Father], or take other\r\n  necessary actions in any subsequent enforcement action on this issue within\r\n  eighteen (18) months of the filing date of this order.Â  In any such action the\r\n  burden of proof shall be on [Mother] to show that she has acted properly and\r\n  has shown the high level of respect for the father/daughter relationship\r\n  intended under this provision.\r\n\r\n[2] Although the family court entered its order transferring placement after the\r\n  eighteen-month reservation period expired, the trial of the issues addressed in\r\n  that order occurred on April 21, 2009, which was within the reservation\r\n  period.Â  \r\n[3] The issues on appeal concern only S.R. because any custody issues relating to\r\n  H.R. were mooted when she turned eighteen in June 2008.Â  \r\n[4] In response to this allegation, the Guardian required Father to undergo a hair\r\n  strand drug test, which revealed no use of illegal drugs.Â  \r\n[5] One of the family court's findings states, &quot;[Father]'s custody of [S.R.]\r\n  is subject to placement continuing with [Mother] (for school assignment and\r\n  emergency purposes).&quot; Â We interpret this finding to mean that the family court\r\n  considered the impact on S.R. of removing her from her present school setting.\r\n[6] In its November 2007 order, the family court discharged the Guardian.Â  The\r\n  order on reconsideration did not alter the custody arrangement.Â  In its June\r\n  2009 order, the family court re-appointed the Guardian for the limited purpose\r\n  of investigating whether S.R. might benefit from the growth hormone treatment\r\n  proposed by Mother.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4901","title":"Lee v.

Hudgins, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n          W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Karen Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: In this post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  action, Kareen Donyell Lee contends the PCR court erred in not finding plea\r\n  counsel ineffective for failing to have him evaluated for competency before his\r\n  guilty plea when a competency evaluation conducted approximately six months\r\n  after his plea revealed he had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 61 and\r\n  was not competent to stand trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 2005, Lee pled guilty\r\n  to two counts of breaking into a motor vehicle, unlawful carrying of a pistol,\r\n  two counts of attempted second-degree burglary, and two counts of second-degree\r\n  burglary.Â  He was twenty-two years old at the time of the guilty pleas.Â  Lee\r\n  pled guilty at the same time as two other defendants in unrelated cases.Â  Lee\r\n  answered last of the three in response to the majority of the plea court's\r\n  questions and responded similarly to the other two with &quot;Yes, sir&quot; or\r\n  &quot;No, sir&quot; to most questions.Â  The plea court asked Lee to speak up\r\n  several times throughout the proceeding.Â  When the plea court asked Lee why he\r\n  was not speaking up, he responded that he was a &quot;soft spoken\r\n  person.&quot;Â  Lee received concurrent sentences of five years' imprisonment\r\n  for each charge of breaking into a motor vehicle, one year for unlawful\r\n  carrying of a pistol, fifteen years for each attempted burglary charge, and\r\n  fifteen years for each second-degree burglary charge.Â  He did not appeal his guilty\r\n  pleas and sentences.Â  \r\nAt the time of the pleas, Lee\r\n  was on probation.Â  The guilty pleas were\r\n  a violation of probation, necessitating a probation violation hearing. Â Prior\r\n  to the hearing, a judge ordered a competency evaluation for Lee because his probation\r\n  violation counsel reported difficulty in communicating.Â  In Lee's December 2005\r\n  forensic evaluation conducted by the South Carolina Department of Disabilities\r\n  and Special Needs (DDSN), he was found not competent to stand trial. \r\nOn May 2, 2006, Lee filed a\r\n  PCR application.Â  Lee's December 2005 forensic evaluation was offered at the\r\n  PCR hearing.Â  The evaluation indicated Lee scored 61 on a 1996 IQ test.Â  He had\r\n  completed high school and obtained a driver's permit, but he had no stable\r\n  employment history. Â Records cited in the evaluation revealed Lee had once been\r\n  hospitalized for behavioral problems, received other mental health services for\r\n  about five months, was diagnosed with mild mental retardation and disruptive\r\n  behavior disorder, and had a significant history of setting fires and engaging\r\n  in cruelty to animals.Â  The evaluation stated that Lee was evaluated in 2002 by\r\n  the Department of Mental Health to determine his capacity to stand trial.Â  According\r\n  to the 2005 evaluation, in 2002 the doctor found evidence of mental retardation\r\n  but issued no opinion on competency and referred Lee to DDSN for further\r\n  evaluation.Â  However, the 2005 evaluation noted that the solicitor's\r\n  office notified DDSN in 2004 that it was not going to pursue further evaluation\r\n  through DDSN.\r\nThe 2005 evaluation further\r\n  stated Lee demonstrated a basic understanding of the charges that resulted in\r\n  his probation and those he committed while on probation.Â  He knew crimes vary\r\n  in seriousness and punishment is commensurate.Â  He defined guilty as &quot;you\r\n  did it&quot; but was unsure of defense counsel's role.Â  While Lee understood\r\n  the solicitor was an antagonistic party, he did not seem to understand the\r\n  requirement that the solicitor prove guilt.Â  The evaluation concluded Lee was\r\n  not able to communicate effectively with counsel and &quot;the fact that he\r\n  would not be able to provide adequate assistance in his defense are sufficient\r\n  grounds for issuing an opinion that he is not at this time competent to stand\r\n  trial.&quot;Â  \r\nThe psychologist who\r\n  conducted the evaluation testified at the PCR hearing.Â  He said Lee may have\r\n  been found incompetent in the past, he had received mental health treatment as\r\n  early as 2000, and his records from school and DDSN indicated a history of\r\n  mental retardation.Â  Specifically, the psychologist stated Lee did not\r\n  understand the plea bargain concept.Â  The psychologist believed Lee's\r\n  incompetence was caused by mental retardation which would have been present in\r\n  June 2005, the time of the guilty pleas.Â  However, the psychologist admitted he\r\n  had only met with Lee one time and acknowledged his report stated Lee would not\r\n  be competent for a hearing held sometime after December 2005. \r\nLee's aunt testified he lived\r\n  with her for five years after his mother died.Â  His aunt said Lee began to\r\n  collect social security checks for a disability based on his mental status when\r\n  he turned eighteen years old.Â  His aunt averred she informed plea counsel Lee\r\n  had a disability and was &quot;not supposed to&quot; make decisions without her\r\n  or Lee's brother. Â She said plea counsel agreed to inform her of Lee's court\r\n  date but plea counsel failed to do so.Â  She stated that in the same\r\n  conversation, plea counsel informed her she may be going on maternity leave.Â  His\r\n  aunt testified she visited Lee in jail the week before he pled guilty and he\r\n  never mentioned his upcoming court date. Â She agreed Lee had entered guilty\r\n  pleas in the past following earlier evaluations, but she was present for those\r\n  pleas.Â  Additionally, she testified he underwent a mental evaluation in 2002\r\n  through the court system.Â  Lee's aunt further testified that Lee was a\r\n  follower.Â  She explained: &quot;[I]f it sounds like he should say yes,\r\n  then he would say yes . . . . [I]f it sounds like he should say no, then he\r\n  will say no.&quot; Â \r\nPlea counsel testified she\r\n  met with Lee at least three times and he appeared to understand a discussion\r\n  about pleading guilty. Â Plea counsel said when she has clients facing\r\n  serious charges, she makes them explain their situation so she knows they\r\n  understand.Â  In Lee's case, the explanation he gave did not raise any &quot;red\r\n  flags.&quot;Â  Plea counsel did not recall the discussion with Lee's aunt, and\r\n  she stated no one informed her of Lee's prior mental evaluations or disability\r\n  checks.Â  Plea counsel confirmed she was pregnant around the time of Lee's case\r\n  and did take maternity leave for a few months.Â  Plea counsel said Lee never\r\n  told her of any prior mental health treatment.Â  Plea counsel testified:\r\n\r\n  One of\r\n    my standard questions I ask defendants even before we plea is do you have any\r\n    type of mental disability, have you ever been treated for any type of mental\r\n    disability in the past?Â  His response to that was no.Â  That was before the\r\n    plea.Â  \r\n  He\r\n    never informed me of that during any of the previous meetings. . . . If he\r\n    doesn't tell me that he's got a problem, I don't see a problem in talking with\r\n    him and he understands what I'm speaking with him about and indicates that he\r\n    understands, I'm not a mind reader.Â  I'm not able to find that out. \r\n\r\nShe admitted if Lee had told\r\n  her he was on disability, she would have investigated, but she stated she had\r\n  &quot;no basis to initiate any type of investigation.&quot; \r\nThe PCR court found Lee\r\n  failed to prove he was incompetent on the day of his guilty plea.Â  The PCR\r\n  court noted Lee told the plea court he did not suffer from any mental\r\n  condition.Â  Additionally, the PCR court found persuasive the psychologist's\r\n  admission that the evaluation could not speak to Lee's competency at the time\r\n  of the plea hearing.Â  Further, the PCR court noted Lee had several prior\r\n  convictions in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004, but he presented no evidence that he\r\n  had been evaluated in connection with those plea hearings.Â  The PCR court found\r\n  plea counsel's testimony was &quot;extremely credible&quot; and Lee failed to\r\n  prove her ineffective.Â  The PCR court found plea counsel met several times with\r\n  Lee, was never informed of his mental health history, and was &quot;not\r\n  required to be clairvoyant.&quot;Â  The PCR court denied Lee's application. Â Lee petitioned this court for writ of certiorari, which we granted.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court gives\r\n  great deference to the PCR court's findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law.&nbsp; Shumpert v. State, 378 S.C. 62, 66, 661 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2008).&nbsp;\r\n  If matters of credibility are involved, then this court gives deference to the\r\n  PCR court's findings because this court lacks the opportunity to directly\r\n  observe the witnesses.&nbsp; Solomon v. State, 313 S.C. 526, 529, 443\r\n  S.E.2d 540, 542 (1994).&nbsp; Any evidence of probative value in the record is\r\n  sufficient to uphold the PCR court's ruling.&nbsp; Caprood v. State, 338\r\n  S.C. 103, 109-10, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLee asserts plea counsel was\r\n  ineffective in failing to obtain a competency evaluation of him prior to his\r\n  guilty pleas.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish a claim\r\n  of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove counsel's\r\n  performance was deficient, and the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\n  applicant's case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 692\r\n  (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â \r\n  To show counsel was deficient, the applicant must establish counsel failed to\r\n  render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms.Â  Strickland,\r\n  466 U.S. at 688; Cherry, 300 S.C. at 117, 386 S.E.2d at 625; see also Matthews v. State, 358 S.C. 456, 459, 596 S.E.2d 49, 50-51&nbsp;(2004)\r\n  (&quot;In order to find that petitioner's trial counsel was ineffective for\r\n  refusing to request a Blair[[1]]\r\n  hearing on petitioner's competency to stand trial,\r\n  petitioner must show that counsel was deficient and that the deficiency\r\n  prejudiced the outcome of petitioner's proceedings.&quot;).Â  To show &quot;prejudice\r\n  within the context of counsel's failure to fully investigate the petitioner's\r\n  mental capacity, 'the [petitioner] need only show a reasonable probability that\r\n  he was either insane at the time [the crime was committed] or incompetent at\r\n  the time of the plea.'&quot;Â  Matthews, 358 S.C. at 459, 596 S.E.2d at\r\n  50 (alterations by court) (quoting Jeter v. State, 308 S.C. 230, 233,\r\n  417 S.E.2d 594, 596 (1992)).\r\nDue process prohibits the\r\n  conviction of an incompetent defendant, and this right may not be waived by a\r\n  guilty plea.Â  Jeter, 308 S.C. at 232, 417 S.E.2d at 595.Â  To prevail\r\n  in a PCR action, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence\r\n  he was incompetent when he\r\n  entered his guilty plea.Â  Matthews, 358 S.C. at 458-59, 596 S.E.2d at\r\n  51; see also Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP.Â  Any evidence of probative value to\r\n  support the PCR court's factual findings is sufficient to uphold those findings\r\n  on appeal.Â  Jeter, 308 S.C. at 232, 417 S.E.2d at 596.Â &quot;The test of competency to enter a plea is the same\r\n  as required to stand trial.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The accused must have\r\n  sufficient capability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\r\n  rational understanding and have a rational as well as factual understanding of\r\n  the proceedings against him.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nÂ In Matthews, 358 S.C.\r\n  at 459, 596 S.E.2d at 51, a psychiatrist, in describing petitioner's mental\r\n  condition, referred to petitioner's quick, nonsensical responses to questions.Â \r\n  When the psychiatrist &quot;asked petitioner where he was, he gave the quick, basic response of\r\n  'here.'Â  When asked if he was in a prison, cafeteria, or zoo, petitioner\r\n  responded, 'zoo.'Â  When asked what his name was, petitioner responded,\r\n  'me.'&quot;Â  Id. at 459-60, 596 S.E.2d at 51.The supreme court held &quot;trial counsel's\r\n  failure to request a Blair hearing prejudiced petitioner under the Jeter standard because there\r\n  was, at minimum, a 'reasonable probability' that petitioner was incompetent at\r\n  the time of his guilty plea.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn Jeter, 308 S.C at\r\n  233, 417 S.E.2d at 596, the court found &quot;[t]he evidence addressed at the\r\n  PCR hearing was insufficient to show deficient performance on the part of [plea]\r\n  counsel.&quot;Â  Plea counsel discussed petitioner's case and his options with\r\n  petitioner on several occasions prior to his plea.Â  Id.Â  The supreme\r\n  court found plea counsel reasonably relied on his own perceptions, particularly\r\n  because counsel was familiar with petitioner from previous representation.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The family who testified at the PCR hearing never raised any concerns regarding\r\n  petitioner's competency to plea counsel.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court\r\n  affirmed the PCR's court determination that plea counsel's failure to request\r\n  &quot;a psychiatric evaluation was not outside the range of reasonable\r\n  professional assistance.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn Matthews, the\r\n  supreme court did not specifically address trial counsel's deficiency.Â \r\n  Seemingly, the court found petitioner's mental state so obvious that trial\r\n  counsel would have had to be deficient not to notice.Â  Unlike Matthews,\r\n  in which a psychiatrist testified defendant answered questions with nonsensical\r\n  answers and that his mental capacity had been the same for a number of years, this\r\n  case is more aligned with Jeter, as plea counsel testified that Lee's\r\n  answers did not raise any suspicions.Â  Even the psychiatrist testified Lee had\r\n  a basic understanding of his charges and to some degree the criminal process.Â  \r\nIn this case, under our\r\n  standard of review, we are constrained to affirm the PCR court's decision.[2] Â Some evidence\r\n  in the record supports the PCR court's findings.Â  Although the PCR court found\r\n  Lee did not present evidence of incompetence at the time of plea, the\r\n  psychiatrist's testimony that Lee's mental status dated back to when he was in\r\n  school and he had a documented history of mental retardation was sufficient to\r\n  show a reasonable probability that he was incompetent at the time of the plea.Â \r\n  However, Lee also had to demonstrate plea counsel's performance was deficient.Â \r\n  Plea counsel could not be deficient if she had no indication of Lee's mental\r\n  status.[3]Â \r\n  Although Lee's aunt testified she informed plea counsel of Lee's mental status,\r\n  plea counsel testified she did not recall a conversation with her.Â  Further,\r\n  plea counsel testified Lee indicated he had no prior mental conditions and none\r\n  of his answers led her to suspect otherwise.Â  We are required to defer to the\r\n  PCR court's findings of credibility, and the PCR court found plea counsel\r\n  &quot;extremely credible.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the PCR court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] State v. Blair, 275 S.C. 529, 273 S.E.2d 536\r\n  (1981).\r\n[2] We do not know Lee's adaptive functioning and whether\r\n  plea counsel should have recognized a cognitive issue from her conversations\r\n  with him, as in Matthews. Â We encourage defense counsel to&nbsp;always inquire\r\n  whether a defendant receives a Supplemental Security&nbsp;Income\r\n  (SSI)&nbsp;check or a Social Security Administration (SSA) check as a threshold\r\n  determination. Â While our holding is appropriate under our standard of review,\r\n  a man with a questionable IQ and a history with mental health and mental\r\n  retardation issues pled guilty on several occasions with multiple lawyers\r\n  without the benefit of a Blair hearing.\r\n[3] At oral argument, Lee argued plea counsel should have\r\n  been alerted to his mental status due to a prior evaluation.Â  The record\r\n  contains no documentation of the evaluation.Â  It does contain Lee's aunt's statement\r\n  that an evaluation occurred, the psychologist's reference to it in his report\r\n  and his testimony, and PCR counsel's questioning plea counsel if she was aware\r\n  Lee was evaluated in 2002 regarding his capacity to stand trial in another case.\r\n  Â PCR counsel stated that the recommendation from the examination was to refer\r\n  Lee to DDSN for further evaluation as to his competency.Â  However, PCR counsel\r\n  posited that evaluation did not occur &quot;because [the solicitor's office]\r\n  informed DDSN via letter that they were not going to pursue further evaluation\r\n  through DDSN.&quot;Â  Plea counsel responded that she did not know anything about\r\n  the evaluation and what had occurred afterwards. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4902","title":"Kimmer v.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4902\r\nHeard March 23, 2011 â€“ Filed November 2, 2011Â Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWarren C. Powell, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nThomas H. Pope, III, of Newberry, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Â Philip\r\n  Wright appeals the trial court's order granting partial summary judgment to\r\n  Carol M. Kimmer, as personal representative of the estate of Richard Kimmer,[1] in which the court held the statute of limitations had not run on Kimmer's\r\n  legal malpractice action.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  January 29, 1999, Kimmer was injured in a motor vehicle accident as he was\r\n  driving to work for his employer, Murata.Â  He hired attorney Philip Wright to\r\n  represent him.Â  Without notice to Murata, Wright settled Kimmer's claims with\r\n  the at-fault driver's insurance carrier for his policy limit of $15,000 on June\r\n  16, 1999.Â  Kimmer filed a Form 50 on June 18, 1999, and an Amended Form 50 on\r\n  May 29, 2002, seeking workers' compensation benefits.Â  Murata filed its Form 51\r\n  denying Kimmer's claim and asserting as a defense the third party action had\r\n  been settled without consent.Â  In a meeting at Wright's office, Wright informed\r\n  Kimmer about his mistake in settling the third party claim and advised him to\r\n  get another attorney due to the potential for Kimmer to file a claim against\r\n  him.Â  Wright followed up this conversation with a letter dated February 1,\r\n  2000.Â  On that same date Kimmer signed a waiver of conflict recognizing he might\r\n  have a right to make a claim against Wright due to his representation in the\r\n  workers' compensation action but agreeing to let Wright continue to represent\r\n  him in the personal injury case.Â  Kimmer terminated Wright's representation of\r\n  him on February 24, 2000.Â  \r\nIn an\r\n  order dated July 31, 2003, the single commissioner found Kimmer's injuries\r\n  compensable because Murata provided him with a car allowance and mileage. Â However,\r\n  the single commissioner denied Kimmer's claim, concluding the settlement of the\r\n  third party claim, without notice to Murata, constituted an election of\r\n  remedies and barred the workers' compensation claim.Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n  affirmed and adopted the order of the single commissioner.Â  In its amended\r\n  order, the circuit court reversed the order of the Appellate Panel, finding\r\n  Murata suffered no prejudice as a result of the settlement without notice.Â  It\r\n  held Kimmer was totally and permanently disabled and was entitled to an award\r\n  of total and permanent disability, less an offset for the third party\r\n  settlement.Â  This court reversed the order of the circuit court and reinstated\r\n  the order of the Appellate Panel.Â  Kimmer v. Murata of Am., 372 S.C. 39,\r\n  640 S.E.2d 507 (Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, (Oct. 18, 2007).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the appeal was proceeding in the workers' compensation case, Wright and Kimmer\r\n  entered into a tolling agreement on October 30, 2003, which provided the time\r\n  period between the date of the agreement and its termination at no later than\r\n  November 1, 2004, would not be included in determining a statute of limitations\r\n  or laches defense.Â  However, the agreement provided it would not be deemed to\r\n  revive any claim that was already barred on that date.Â  Kimmer brought this\r\n  action on October 14, 2004.Â  On May 13, 2005, Wright filed an amended answer\r\n  asserting Kimmer's legal malpractice action was barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  \r\nOn June\r\n  20, 2005, the Honorable S. Jackson Kimball denied Wright's motion for summary\r\n  judgment on the statute of limitations defense.Â  The judge explained that the\r\n  adverse ruling of the Workers' Compensation Commission would be the similar\r\n  &quot;trigger&quot; event as the adverse jury verdict that triggered the\r\n  running of the statute of limitations in Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372,\r\n  376, 610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005). Â The court held, &quot;This Court believes\r\n  that there is at least an issue of fact in the present case as to when\r\n  [Kimmer's] awareness of the possibility of an error by [Wright] became\r\n  sufficient to put him on notice that he actually had an existing legal malpractice\r\n  claim against [Wright] as opposed to being told merely that he 'may have' a\r\n  claim.Â  The resolution of that possibility involved legal issues upon which, to\r\n  this point, the Commission and the Circuit Court disagree.&quot;Â  Judge Kimball\r\n  granted a stay of the legal malpractice action until the appeal of the workers'\r\n  compensation case was completed.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the supreme court denied certiorari of this court's decision in the workers'\r\n  compensation case, both parties moved for summary judgment in the legal\r\n  malpractice action.Â  The motions were heard before the Honorable John C.\r\n  Hayes.Â  While Judge Hayes noted the facts suggested Kimmer had notice of a\r\n  potential claim before the Commission's adverse decision, he held he was bound\r\n  by Judge Kimball's determination that the statute of limitations was triggered\r\n  by the Commission's order denying benefits.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â \r\n  Law of the Case\r\nWright\r\n  argues Judge Hayes erred in holding Judge Kimball's order was the law of the\r\n  case.Â  Kimmer conceded this issue in his brief.Â  &quot;A denial of summary\r\n  judgment does not establish the law of the case and is not directly appealable.&quot;Â  In re Rabens, 386 S.C. 469, 473, 688 S.E.2d 602, 604 (Ct. App. 2010).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find Judge Hayes erred in this ruling.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Statute of Limitations\r\nWright\r\n  argues the trial court erred in holding as a matter of law the statute of limitations\r\n  had not run on Kimmer's malpractice claim.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  statute of limitations for a legal malpractice action is three years. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005) (stating the statute of limitations for &quot;an\r\n  action for assault, battery, or any injury to the person or rights of another,\r\n  not arising on contract and not enumerated by law&quot; is three years); see\r\n    also Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 444, 492 S.E.2d 794, 799 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997) (finding section 15-3-530(5) provides a three-year statute of limitations\r\n  for legal malpractice actions). Â The discovery rule applies in this action. Â See Kelly v. Logan, Jolley, &amp; Smith, L.L.P., 383 S.C. 626, 632-33, 682\r\n  S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 2009) (applying discovery rule in legal malpractice\r\n  action). Â Under the discovery rule, &quot;the three-year clock starts ticking\r\n  on the 'date the injured party either knows or should have known by the\r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the\r\n  wrongful conduct.'&quot; Â Martin v. Companion Healthcare Corp., 357 S.C.\r\n  570, 575-76, 593 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Bayle v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't. of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001)); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005) (&quot;[A]ll actions initiated\r\n  under Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three years after the person\r\n  knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a\r\n  cause of action.&quot;).Â  The supreme court explained reasonable diligence\r\n  means\r\n\r\nsimply\r\n  that an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and\r\n  circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and\r\n  experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim\r\n  against another party might exist. Â The statute of limitations begins\r\n    to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown\r\n    theory of recovery developed. Â Under Â§ 15-3-535, the statute of limitations\r\n  is triggered not merely by knowledge of an injury but by knowledge of facts,\r\n  diligently acquired, sufficient to put an injured person on notice of the\r\n  existence of a cause of action against another. \r\n\r\nEpstein v. Brown,\r\n  363 S.C. 372, 376, 610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nKimmer relies\r\n  on Epstein to support her position the statute of limitations in a legal\r\n  malpractice case does not start to run until an adverse judgment in the\r\n  underlying action.Â  We find this reliance is misplaced.Â  In Epstein the\r\n  supreme court refused to adopt the continuous representation rule, which holds\r\n  the statute of limitations is tolled during the period an attorney continues to\r\n  represent the client on the same matter out of which the alleged malpractice\r\n  arose.Â  Id. 363 S.C. at 380, 610 S.E.2d at 820.Â  The supreme court\r\n  similarly rejected Epstein's argument the statute of limitations should not be\r\n  deemed to have run until the conclusion of the appeal of the underlying action\r\n  because it was not until that date upon which he suffered &quot;legal\r\n  damages.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Instead, the court held the statute of limitations\r\n  had begun to run by the conclusion of the trial in the underlying action.Â  Id. at 382, 610 S.E.2d at 821.Â  The court cautioned:Â  \r\n\r\nWe\r\n  do not hold that, in all instances, the date of a jury's adverse verdict is the\r\n  date on which the [statute of limitations] begins to run. To the contrary, we\r\n  hold only that, under the facts of this case, Dr. Epstein knew of a potential\r\n  claim against Brown by this date, at the latest.\r\n\r\nId. at 383 n.8, at\r\n  610 S.E.2d at 821 n.8 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n Thus, the court\r\n  did not establish a bright-line test the statute of limitations cannot begin to\r\n  run until the jury's adverse verdict, but held, in that particular case, the latest it began to run was the conclusion of the trial.Â  See also Kelly,\r\n  383 S.C. at 637, 682 S.E.2d at 6 (holding statute of limitations on Kelly's\r\n  legal malpractice action began to run well before Kelly was dismissed from\r\n  underlying action).\r\nKimmer\r\n  asserts the statute of limitations was not triggered until the Commission's\r\n  adverse ruling because until then he could not have established an injury that\r\n  was proximately caused by Wright's negligence.Â  He asserts until then there was\r\n  a possibility the Commission would hold his claim was not compensable because\r\n  it was not work-related or that the third-party settlement did not bar his\r\n  claim.Â  These issues could have been litigated in the legal malpractice action\r\n  if necessary.Â  See Doe v. Howe, 367 S.C. 432, 442, 626 S.E.2d 25,\r\n  30 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding as to damages, the plaintiff must show he most\r\n  probably would have been successful in the underlying suit if the attorney had\r\n  not committed the alleged malpractice and the question of the success of the\r\n  underlying claim, if suit had been brought, is a question of law).Â  In a case\r\n  cited by Epstein, the Indiana Court of Appeals rejected such a\r\n  contention and held the statute of limitations in a legal malpractice claim\r\n  began to run when the attorney informed the clients that he had failed to\r\n  timely file a medical malpractice claim and not when summary judgment was\r\n  granted on the declaratory judgment action.Â  Basinger v. Sullivan, 540\r\n  N.E.2d 91, 93-94 (Ind. Ct. App. 1989).Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n  legal malpractice is claimed for an attorney's failure to commence an action\r\n  within the period of limitations it is generally held that one of the necessary\r\n  ultimate proofs for a recovery of damages is that a recovery would have been\r\n  had if the suit had been properly brought. Can it then be contended that the\r\n  limitation period does not commence to run on the attorney's negligence until\r\n  plaintiff's right to recovery on the original claim has been judicially\r\n  established? Clearly, the answer is no. To permit such reasoning would for all\r\n  practical purposes preclude the statute from ever commencing to run.\r\n\r\nId. at 93\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we find Kimmer's assertion does not comply with our precedent.Â  This court\r\n  held: &quot;[O]nce a reasonable person has reason to believe that some right of\r\n  his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist, the\r\n  requirement of reasonable diligence to investigate this information further\r\n  takes precedence over the inability to ascertain the amount of damages or even\r\n  the possibility that damages may be forthcoming at all.&quot;Â  Binkley v.\r\n    Burry, 352 S.C. 286, 297-98, 573 S.E.2d 838, 844-45 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  Wright's February 1, 2000 letter, Wright explained that the workers'\r\n  compensation statutes require the claimant to notify the Commission, the\r\n  employer, and the employer's insurance carrier in the event of a settlement\r\n  with a third party.Â  He admitted, &quot;I did not give those parties\r\n  notification, so that may prejudice your right to recover workers' compensation\r\n  benefits, if, in fact, you were entitled based on the facts of the case to\r\n  receive those benefits.&quot;Â  He informed Kimmer the attorney for Murata denied\r\n  Kimmer was entitled to workers' compensation benefits because Wright had\r\n  settled with the third party without providing the required notice.Â  Kimmer\r\n  signed a Waiver of Conflict dated February 1, 2000, which provided: &quot;I\r\n  understand that I may have a right to make a claim against Mr. Wright\r\n  concerning his representation related to my workers' compensation\r\n  action.&quot;Â  \r\nIn his\r\n  deposition, Kimmer stated that during an office conference some time before\r\n  February 1, 2000, Wright told him he had &quot;screwed this up&quot; and Kimmer\r\n  would have to get another attorney to take the workers' compensation case.Â \r\n  Kimmer acknowledged he understood from Wright's February 1, 2000 letter the\r\n  reason he was not receiving workers' compensation benefits was because Wright\r\n  had made a mistake and Kimmer might have a claim against him.Â  Kimmer admitted beginning\r\n  in 1999, the failure to receive workers' compensation payments caused him\r\n  problems.Â  He stated the failure to receive benefits contributed to his having\r\n  post-traumatic stress disorder and depression problems.Â  A medical report dated\r\n  October 17, 2000, refers to Kimmer having severe post-traumatic stress\r\n  syndrome.Â  \r\nThus,\r\n  more than three years before he and Wright entered into the tolling agreement, Kimmer\r\n  was aware Wright had made a significant error in settling the third-party claim\r\n  without notice, that he was not receiving workers' compensation benefits\r\n  because of Wright's error, and he was suffering financial and emotional damages\r\n  due to the error.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in holding the statute of\r\n  limitations did not begin to run until the single commissioner issued her\r\n  order.Â  \r\nC.Â \r\n  Equitable Tolling\r\nAs an\r\n  additional sustaining ground, Kimmer urges this court to apply the doctrine of\r\n  equitable tolling.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court recently adopted this\r\n  doctrine.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Sr. Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., 386 S.C.\r\n  108, 687 S.E.2d 29 (2009).Â  The court explained the doctrine of equitable\r\n  tolling may be applied to toll the running of the statute of limitations &quot;to\r\n  serve the ends of justice where technical forfeitures would unjustifiably\r\n  prevent a trial on the merits.&quot;Â  Id. at 115, 687 S.E.2d at 32.Â  The\r\n  court explained:\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  equitable power of a court is not bound by cast-iron rules but exists to do\r\n  fairness and is flexible and adaptable to particular exigencies so that relief\r\n  will be granted when, in view of all the circumstances, to deny it would permit\r\n  one party to suffer a gross wrong at the hands of the other. Â Equitable tolling\r\n  may be applied where it is justified under all the circumstances. \r\n\r\nId. Â at 116-17,\r\n  687 S.E.2d at 33 (citation and quotation marks omitted).Â  The court noted the\r\n  party claiming the statute of limitations should be tolled bears the burden of\r\n  establishing sufficient facts to justify its use. Â Id. at 115, 687\r\n  S.E.2d at 32.Â  It cautioned equitable tolling was a doctrine that should be\r\n  used sparingly and only when the interests of justice compel its use.Â  Id. at 117, 687 S.E.2d at 33.Â  \r\nKimmer\r\n  argues the court should apply the doctrine because 1) Wright testified for\r\n  Kimmer in the workers' compensation hearing; 2) Wright entered into the tolling\r\n  agreement a year after he contends the statute ran; and 3) Wright did not\r\n  assert the statute of limitations defense until 2005 when his insurance counsel\r\n  moved to amend his answer.Â  He asserts he &quot;should not be penalized for\r\n  pursuing his quasi-judicial rights at the Workers' Compensation Commission.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  tolling agreement specifically provided it would not be deemed to revive any\r\n  claim that was already barred on that date.Â  Kimmer does not direct this\r\n  court's attention to any action by Wright that would establish Wright led\r\n  Kimmer to believe he would not assert the statute of limitations as a defense.Â \r\n  Further, Kimmer could have protected his claim against Wright while pursuing\r\n  his workers' compensation claim.Â  In Epstein, the supreme court rejected\r\n  Epstein's argument that requiring him to pursue an appeal while simultaneously\r\n  filing a malpractice suit against his attorney would have put him in the\r\n  awkward position of arguing inconsistent positions in two different courts. Â Epstein\r\n    v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 381-82, 610 S.E.2d 816, 821 (2005).Â  The court\r\n  noted a plaintiff could take measures to avoid such inconsistent positions such\r\n  as filing the malpractice action and then seeking a stay of the malpractice\r\n  agreement during the appeal or entering into a tolling agreement for the\r\n  malpractice claim for the pendency of the appeal.Â  Id.Â  Kimmer could\r\n  have requested a tolling agreement earlier or brought his malpractice action\r\n  and requested a stay.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  we are sympathetic to Kimmer's situation, we are mindful the supreme court\r\n  cautioned the doctrine of equitable tolling was to be used sparingly.Â  We find\r\n  application of the doctrine is not justified under the circumstances of this\r\n  case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We\r\n  find the trial court erred in holding the statute of limitations did not bar\r\n  Kimmer's legal malpractice action.Â  Accordingly we reverse the order of the\r\n  trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  \r\n REVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER, J., concurs.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., dissenting: Â Attorney Philip Wright concedes that a mistake he made\r\n  in the course of representing Richard Kimmer in a workers' compensation case\r\n  was a breach of the duty he owed to his client.Â  He thus concedes the first two\r\n  elements of a legal malpractice claim existed as of the date of the mistake.Â  However,\r\n  as with many mistakes lawyers make in the course of litigation, no damage\r\n  resulted from the mistake until the workers' compensation commission denied\r\n  benefits to Kimmer. Â At that point, the other two elements which must be\r\n  present before a cause of action for legal malpractice accruesâ€”causation and\r\n  damageâ€”came into existence for the first time.Â  Kimmer filed suit against\r\n  Wright within three years of the date all four elements existed, and thus\r\n  complied with the statute of limitations.Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nThe statute of limitations requires that legal malpractice\r\n  actions &quot;be commenced within three years after the person knew or by the\r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of\r\n  action.&quot; Â Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 444-45, 492 S.E.2d\r\n  794, 799 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A legal malpractice cause of action consists of four elements: &quot;(1) the existence of an\r\n  attorney-client relationship; (2) a breach of duty by the attorney; (3) damage\r\n  to the client; and (4) proximate cause of the client's damages by the\r\n  breach.&quot;Â  Rydde v. Morris, 381 S.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d\r\n  431, 433 (2009).Â  When any one of these elements is\r\n  missing, the client does not have a legal malpractice cause of action against\r\n  the lawyer.Â  Thus, the statute of limitations\r\n  does not begin to run until all four elements, including damage, are present.Â  \r\nA\r\n  lawyer's breach of duty to the client necessarily occurs before the damage\r\n  resulting from the breach.Â  In other words, damage is always the last element\r\n  of a legal malpractice claim to occur.Â  Therefore, our courts have described\r\n  the point at which the statute of limitations begins to run as &quot;where the facts and circumstances of an injury would\r\n  put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of\r\n  his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.&quot;Â  Mitchell v. Holler, 311 S.C. 406, 409, 429 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1993)\r\n  (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  In Mitchell,\r\n  as in every published decision on the statute of limitations in a legal\r\n  malpractice case except for one, the prospective plaintiff discovered the\r\n  injury before learning of the negligent act or omission that caused it.Â  In\r\n  each of those cases, the court held that the occurrence of the injury put the\r\n  client on notice to inquire as to whether the injury was caused by the\r\n  attorney's negligence.[2]Â  \r\nHere, the\r\n  situation is different.Â  Wright made Kimmer aware of the negligence, but Kimmer\r\n  did not suffer an actionable injury for another three years.Â  The majority has\r\n  taken language from these prior cases, inapplicable to the facts of this case,[3] and used it to hold that when the client learns of his lawyer's negligence, the\r\n  statute of limitations begins to run even though he has yet to suffer any\r\n  injury.Â  I respectfully disagree.\r\nMy point\r\n  is illustrated by Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 610 S.E.2d 816 (2005),\r\n  the one decision in which the factual scenario is similar, although not\r\n  identical, to this one. Â Dr. Epstein sued Brown for legal malpractice Brown\r\n  allegedly committed in the course of defending Dr. Epstein in a medical\r\n  malpractice lawsuit.Â  363 S.C. at 374-75, 610 S.E.2d at 817.Â  The medical\r\n  malpractice lawsuit resulted in a $6,028,535.88 verdict against Dr. Epstein.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The trial court granted summary judgment to Brown on the basis that Dr. Epstein\r\n  had not complied with the statute of limitations.Â  363 S.C. at 375, 610 S.E.2d\r\n  at 817.Â  The supreme court affirmed, holding &quot;Dr. Epstein clearly knew, or\r\n  should have known he might have had some claim against Brown at the conclusion\r\n  of his trial.&quot;Â  363 S.C. at 382, 610 S.E.2d at 821.Â  \r\nI will\r\n  discuss below my contention that Epstein is controlling, and that the\r\n  statute therefore began to run &quot;at the conclusion of [Kimmer's]\r\n  trial,&quot; the date of the single commissioner's ruling.Â  However, even if Epstein is not controlling, the supreme court's holding illustrates an important\r\n  reality about litigation that requires us to affirm the circuit court: lawyers\r\n  make mistakes during the course of litigation, and yet if the client wins the case,\r\n  no damage results from those mistakes.Â  Recognizing this reality is essential\r\n  to the analysis of a statute of limitations question in a legal malpractice\r\n  action arising out of litigation because the existence of damage is one of the\r\n  elements.Â  Rydde, 381 S.C. at 646, 675 S.E.2d at 433 (stating the\r\n  elements of a legal malpractice claim include &quot;damage to the\r\n  client&quot;).Â  Like Kimmer in this case, Dr. Epstein made allegations of\r\n  malpractice against Brown arising out of events that occurred long before the\r\n  trial.[4]Â \r\n  However, if the jury found in Dr. Epstein's favor, he would not have suffered\r\n  damages, and no cause of action would ever have accrued against Brown. \r\nThe same\r\n  is true here.Â  The effect of Wright's negligence on Kimmer's right to recover\r\n  workers' compensation benefits was not known until at least July 31, 2003, when\r\n  the single commissioner ruled against Kimmer and denied his claim for\r\n  benefits.Â  Until then, Kimmer and his lawyers were working hard to win the\r\n  case, despite Wright's negligence.Â  The damages element was missing because the\r\n  possibility remained that Kimmer would prevail on the claim.Â  When the single\r\n  commissioner ruled, however, Kimmer knew Wright's negligence caused him to lose\r\n  his workers' compensation case.Â  Because damage existed then for the first\r\n  time, Wright's negligence became actionable malpractice for the first time.Â \r\n  Kimmer commenced this action on October 14, 2004, well within the statute of\r\n  limitations.\r\nThe\r\n  majority's reliance on Binkley and the &quot;reasonable diligence&quot;\r\n  language from Epstein is misplaced.Â  In Binkley, and in all cases\r\n  in which the reasonable diligence language is important, the prospective\r\n  plaintiff was aware of the damage, but was unaware of the attorney's negligent\r\n  conduct that caused the damage.Â  In Binkley, for example, we held the\r\n  statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs knew of the existence\r\n  of an easement allowing a conservation district to cause flooding on the\r\n  plaintiffs' property.Â  352 S.C. at 297, 573 S.E.2d at 844.Â  We held this even\r\n  though no flooding had yet occurred, and the plaintiffs had no idea the defendant\r\n  law firm had negligently failed to disclose the easement.Â  Id.Â  We\r\n  explained that the mere existence of the easement was sufficient damage to put\r\n  the plaintiff on inquiry notice.Â  Id.Â  (&quot;An easement by its very\r\n  nature involves the right to encroach upon another's property.&quot;).Â  Because\r\n  the plaintiffs knew of the easement, we held they &quot;had inquiry notice of a\r\n  possible claim against [the law firm] regarding the easement.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  In Binkley, it was knowledge of the existence of damage that caused the\r\n  statute of limitations to begin to run.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  the majority relies on the following language from Binkley: &quot;the\r\n  requirement of reasonable diligence to investigate this information further\r\n  takes precedence over the inability to ascertain the amount of damages or\r\n    even the possibility that damages may be forthcoming at all.&quot;Â  352\r\n  S.C. at 298, 573 S.E.2d at 845 (emphasis added).Â  The majority interprets the\r\n  emphasized language to support its position that a legal malpractice cause of\r\n  action can accrue, and thus the statute of limitations begins to run, before\r\n  any damage has occurred.Â  I respectfully disagree with the majority's\r\n  interpretation.Â  Rather, the Binkley court's previous statement that the\r\n  mere existence of the easement caused the landowner damage, taken in the\r\n  context of the case, indicates this emphasized language refers to the\r\n  insignificance of the fact that no flooding had yet occurred.Â  My point is\r\n  supported by a footnote at the end of the emphasized language, in which we\r\n  cited Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647\r\n  (1996), for the principle &quot;the fact that the injured party may not\r\n  comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.&quot;Â  352 S.C. at 298\r\n  n.21, 573 S.E.2d at 845 n.21.Â  These circumstances demonstrate that the\r\n  language from Binkley relied on by the majority does not indicate that a\r\n  legal malpractice cause of action can accrue before there is damage.Â  Rather,\r\n  we used the language relied on by the majority to indicate that on those facts,\r\n  the circumstance that the flooding had not yet occurred did not delay the\r\n  commencement of the statute of limitations. \r\nThe\r\n  majority also relies on the following language from Epstein: \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an injured party must act\r\n  with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a\r\n  person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has\r\n  been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.Â  \r\n\r\n363 S.C. at 376, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 818.Â  The majority quotes this language, which emphasizes the word\r\n  &quot;might.&quot;Â  Here, the correct language to emphasize is &quot;injured\r\n  party&quot; and &quot;the facts and circumstances of an injury.&quot;Â  The\r\n  language is used to describe a situation when a known injury &quot;might&quot;\r\n  have resulted from a lawyer's negligence.Â  The language was never intended to\r\n  apply to a situation like we have here, where a lawyer's known negligence\r\n  &quot;might&quot; later result in injury.Â  The same is true in all of our\r\n  published decisions on the statute of limitations in legal malpractice cases,\r\n  except Epstein.Â  In each case, the prospective plaintiff was aware of\r\n  the injury, and that awareness put the plaintiff on notice to inquire into\r\n  whether the injury was caused by the lawyer's negligence.[5]Â Â Â  \r\nWright\r\n  asserts several additional reasons the statute of limitations began to run\r\n  earlier than the date of the single commissioner's ruling.Â  First, he argues\r\n  the &quot;unmistakable&quot; quality of his malpractice caused the statute to\r\n  begin to run immediately.Â  I disagree.Â  As an initial matter, to condition the\r\n  commencement of the statute of limitations in a legal malpractice case on the\r\n  degree of the lawyer's negligence creates an unmanageable standard for courts\r\n  to apply.Â  Even assuming Wright is correct that his malpractice was\r\n  unmistakable, how would the court treat malpractice that was barely mistakable,\r\n  or merely probable?Â  Second, the circuit court's ruling on appeal from the\r\n  commission establishes that Wright's malpractice was not unmistakable.Â  It would\r\n  be patently unfair for this court to say Kimmer should have known he would\r\n  eventually be damaged, and thus had a cause of action against Wright, when a\r\n  circuit judge made precisely the opposite ruling in the same case.Â  The fact\r\n  that this court later reversed the circuit judge is not important.Â  The circuit\r\n  court's ruling established that Kimmer retained a reasonable chance of winning\r\n  his workers' compensation claim even after Wright's &quot;unmistakable&quot;\r\n  negligence.\r\nWright\r\n  also argues the statute of limitations began to run because Kimmer did in fact\r\n  suffer damage before the single commissioner's ruling due to the carrier's denial\r\n  of temporary benefits.Â  I disagree.Â  First, this also creates an unmanageable standard.Â \r\n  The courts cannot condition the commencement of the statute of limitations on\r\n  whether a workers' compensation insurance adjuster agrees or refuses to pay\r\n  temporary benefits.Â  Taken not even to its extreme, Wright's argument provides\r\n  that a cause of action accrues against a workers' compensation claimant's\r\n  lawyer any time some minor mistake in the lawyer's office results in even a\r\n  brief delay in requesting temporary benefits.Â  Second, and more importantly, a\r\n  claimant who is denied temporary benefits but later prevails at the final\r\n  hearing is entitled to receive retroactive benefits.Â  See Langdale v.\r\n    Harris Carpets, Op. No. 4853 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 20, 2011) (Shearouse\r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 24 at 97, 106) (affirming commission's award of temporary benefits\r\n  after employer denied payment).Â  Thus, Kimmer did not suffer any damage resulting\r\n  from his interim loss of temporary benefits.Â  Rather, as with any other type of\r\n  contested workers' compensation benefits, his entitlement to temporary benefits\r\n  depended on the ultimate decision of the commission.Â  See Tiller v.\r\n    Nat'l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 343, 513 S.E.2d 843, 848\r\n  (1999) (affirming commission's award of temporary total benefits).\r\nFinally,\r\n  and most importantly, the supreme court addressed this question in Epstein,\r\n  and held that in an action based on alleged malpractice during the course of\r\n  litigation, the statute of limitations begins to run when a lawyer's negligence\r\n  results in a ruling adverse to the client in a trial.Â  &quot;Dr. Epstein\r\n  clearly knew, or should have known he might have had some claim against Brown at\r\n    the conclusion of his trial.&quot;Â  Epstein, 363 S.C. at 382, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 821 (emphasis added).Â  The comparable point in time in this case,\r\n  when under Epstein the statute of limitations began to run, is the\r\n  single commissioner's ruling.Â  I believe we are bound to apply Epstein to this appeal, and must affirm.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority argues, however, that Epstein is not controlling, emphasizing a\r\n  footnote in which the court stated:\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  do not hold that, in all instances, the date of a jury's adverse verdict is the\r\n  date on which the [statute of limitations] begins to run. Â To the contrary, we\r\n  hold only that, under the facts of this case, Dr. Epstein knew of a potential\r\n  claim against Brown by this date, at the latest.\r\n\r\n363 S.C. at 383 n.8, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 821 n.8 (emphasis added).Â  The majority argues the emphasized\r\n  language &quot;at the latest&quot; means that under some circumstances the\r\n  statute could begin to run before an adverse decision by a trial court or\r\n  administrative agency, but could never begin to run afterwards.Â Â Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  I believe &quot;at the latest&quot; means the opposite of what the majority\r\n  contends.Â  In order to understand this point, consider the dissenting opinion\r\n  filed by the Chief Justice and the unique damages claim made by Dr. Epstein.Â \r\n  In her dissent, the Chief Justice argued that no injury occurred, and thus the\r\n  statute of limitations did not begin to run, until all appeals were exhausted\r\n  and the remittitur had been sent to the lower court.Â  363 S.C. at 383, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 822.Â  As to Dr. Epstein's damages claim, he alleged damages to his\r\n  reputation arising from adverse publicity when the verdict was announced, in\r\n  addition to economic losses arising from the $6 million judgment against him.Â  See 363 S.C. at 376, 382, 610 S.E.2d at 818, 821.Â  \r\nSeveral\r\n  paragraphs before the Epstein majority's &quot;at the conclusion of his\r\n  trial&quot; holding, and the &quot;at the latest&quot; language of footnote 8,\r\n  the majority began discussing the position the Chief Justice took in her\r\n  dissent as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Epstein asserts that, even if we do not adopt the\r\n  continuous representation rule, the statute of limitations should not be deemed\r\n  to have begun to run until the date on which this Court denied certiorari\r\n  (January 11, 2001), because it was not until that date upon which he suffered\r\n  &quot;legal damages.&quot; Â We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n  363 S.C. at 380, 610 S.E.2d at 820.Â  The Epstein majority then gave\r\n  several reasons it disagreed.Â  First, the court cited a number of decisions\r\n  from other jurisdictions which &quot;tend to hold that a plaintiff may\r\n  institute a malpractice action prior to the conclusion of the appeal.&quot;Â  363\r\n  S.C. at 380-81, 610 S.E.2d at 820-21.Â  Second, the court refuted the argument\r\n  &quot;that requiring [a plaintiff] to pursue an appeal while simultaneously\r\n  filing a malpractice suit against his attorney puts him in the awkward position\r\n  of arguing inconsistent positions in two different courts.&quot;Â  363 S.C. at\r\n  381-82, 610 S.E.2d at 821.Â  \r\nThen the Epstein majority cited the &quot;discovery rule,&quot; and noted\r\n  &quot;[t]he fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full extent of\r\n  the damage is immaterial.&quot;Â  363 S.C. at 382, 610 S.E.2d at 821.Â  Applying\r\n  the discovery rule &quot;[u]nder the facts of this case,&quot; the Epstein majority pointed out: &quot;The damages [Dr. Epstein] claims are largely those\r\n  to his reputation.&quot;Â  Id.Â  After discussing what Dr. Epstein knew\r\n  before the trial and during the course of the appeal about his lawyer's\r\n  performance, the court concluded: &quot;It is patent Dr. Epstein knew, or\r\n  should have known, of a possible claim against Brown long before this Court\r\n  denied certiorari in January 2001.&quot;Â  363 S.C. at 383, 610 S.E.2d at 821.Â  Footnote\r\n  8 is found at the end of the next sentence.\r\nI\r\n  believe the purpose of footnote 8 and the &quot;at the latest&quot; statement\r\n  is to demonstrate that the Chief Justice's argument would not change the outcome\r\n  of Epstein because of the allegation of injury to reputation.Â  In other\r\n  words, the purpose of footnote 8 is to explain that even if an appellate court\r\n  had reversed the verdict, thereby eliminating the economic portion of Dr.\r\n  Epstein's damages claim, the alleged injury to his reputation was at least\r\n  partially irreversible and would have remained.Â  In that situation, regardless\r\n  of what the appellate court did to reverse his economic injury, Dr. Epstein\r\n  suffered injury to his reputation as of the date of the jury verdict.Â \r\n  Therefore, the court stated &quot;under the facts of this case, Dr. Epstein\r\n  knew of a potential claim against Brown by [the date of the jury's verdict], at\r\n  the latest.&quot;Â  363 S.C. at 383 n.8, 610 S.E.2d at 821 n.8.Â  \r\nUnder this\r\n  reading, the Epstein majority did not intend the &quot;at the\r\n  latest&quot; statement to indicate that the statute might have started to run\r\n  before the verdict.Â  Rather, the statement is part of the majority's response\r\n  to the argument that the statute begins to run after the appeals have been\r\n  exhausted, and specifically recognizes that the unique allegation of damage to\r\n  Dr. Epstein's reputation makes that argument inapplicable to the facts of that\r\n  case.Â  Thus, the majority's reason for distinguishing Epstein is unfounded,\r\n  and we are left with no basis on which to conclude that the supreme court did\r\n  not mean what it said when it chose these words: &quot;Dr. Epstein clearly\r\n  knew, or should have known he might have had some claim against Brown at the\r\n  conclusion of his trial.&quot;Â  363 S.C. at 382, 610 S.E.2d at 821.Â  Epstein therefore controls the outcome of this case: the statute of limitations did not\r\n  run on Kimmer's claim.\r\nThe\r\n  practice of law is an imperfect art in which lawyers necessarily take risks and\r\n  make mistakes.Â  However, when a litigator makes a mistakeâ€”indeed commits\r\n  malpractice, such as Wright did in this caseâ€”nobody knows whether the mistake will\r\n  cause damage until the damage materializes in the form of an adverse judgment.Â \r\n  For this reason, the statute of limitations did not begin to run on Kimmer's\r\n  claim against Wright until July 31, 2003, when the single commissioner denied\r\n  workers' compensation benefits.Â  Kimmer filed suit on October 14, 2004.Â  Because\r\n  he commenced his action against Wright within the three-year statute of\r\n  limitations, the circuit court correctly granted partial summary judgment to Kimmer. Â \r\nI would\r\n  affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Richard Kimmer passed away March 2, 2008, while this case was pending.Â  For\r\n  ease of reference, the name &quot;Kimmer&quot; will refer interchangeably to\r\n  either Richard Kimmer, the personal representative, or to both parties\r\n  collectively.Â  \r\n[2] See Christensen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 73, 476 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1996) (finding statute ran from point when client knew\r\n  he did not have title insurance); Mitchell,\r\n  311 S.C. at 409, 429 S.E.2d at 795 (holding knowledge of murder conviction,\r\n  coupled with complaint about trial counsel's performance, commenced running of\r\n  statute); Manios v.

Monteith, 327 S.C. 116,\r\n  120-21, 489 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1997) (holding although client knew of injury for\r\n  years, there was a question of fact as to when she should have learned of\r\n  attorney's conflict of interest in transaction causing the injury).\r\n[3] See discussion of Binkley below.\r\n[4] For example, as the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\nIn his complaint, Dr. Epstein\r\n  alleged Brown was negligent in numerous particulars, including: failing to\r\n  conduct an adequate investigation, failing to advise Epstein to settle, failing\r\n  to keep Epstein adequately informed during the pendency of the case, representing\r\n  multiple defendants with conflicts of interest, . . . and adopting a defense\r\n  which was contrary to Dr. Epstein's medical opinion.\r\n\r\nEpstein, 363 S.C.\r\n  at 376, 610 S.E.2d at 818.Â  Several of these allegations arise out of actions\r\n  Brown took before he even filed an answer.Â  Presumably, for example, Brown made\r\n  the decision to represent multiple defendants almost as soon as Dr. Epstein's\r\n  complaint was served.Â  \r\n[5] See footnote 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4903","title":"State v.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nI.&nbsp; Facts and Procedural History\r\nGilmore\r\n  and the victim knew each other for approximately ten years, dated each other\r\n  for about six months, and lived together in Gilmore's house until three weeks\r\n  before the crime. Â The victim testified that on the day of the crime she visited the house to check on furniture\r\n  she left behind.Â  Gilmore was not home when she arrived, so she talked with\r\n  another woman for a short while until Gilmore returned.Â  After the other woman left,\r\n  Gilmore and the victim talked while Gilmore gave her a foot rub.Â  The victim\r\n  gave Gilmore money to go to the liquor store.Â  Gilmore returned with a pint of\r\n  gin, which they drank together.Â  After they finished drinking the gin, Gilmore went\r\n  to the back of the house to speak with a man who had stopped by, and the victim\r\n  stayed in another room talking to a woman who was with the man.Â  The victim\r\n  testified that after the man and woman left, Gilmore came running at her in a\r\n  rage and slapped her two or three times in the face.Â  She later explained that\r\n  Gilmore was angry because he thought she had said something to the woman about\r\n  another man.Â  She testified she attempted to leave after being slapped, but\r\n  Gilmore would not allow it.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  victim then testified to the events of the sexual assault.Â  Gilmore told the\r\n  victim he wanted to have sex and pulled a knife.Â  He forced her to remove her\r\n  clothes and to pull a mattress into another room.Â  He then raped her on the\r\n  mattress.Â  She testified that during the sexual assault he told her: &quot;If I\r\n  was like I was, Bitch, I would have killed you.Â  You would be a dead\r\n  Bitch,&quot; and &quot;I've killed one, and I'll kill again.&quot;Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, Gilmore requested a charge for\r\n  ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of CSC.Â  The trial judge denied the request.Â \r\n  The jury found Gilmore guilty of first-degree CSC, and the trial judge\r\n  sentenced him to life in prison.\r\nII.&nbsp; ABHAN as a Lesser-Included\r\n  Offense\r\nGilmore\r\n  contends on appeal there is evidence in the record from which the jury could\r\n  have concluded he committed ABHAN and not CSC.Â  We disagree.Â  CSC in the first\r\n  degree is defined by statute as follows: &quot;the actor engages in sexual\r\n  battery with the victim and . . . (a) [t]he actor uses aggravated force to\r\n  accomplish sexual battery.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652(a) (Supp. 2010).Â  ABHAN\r\n  is a lesser-included offense of first degree CSC.Â  State v. Primus, 349\r\n  S.C. 576, 581, 564 S.E.2d 103, 106 (2002), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 106, 610 S.E.2d 494, 501 (2005).Â  If there\r\n  is evidence in the record from which the jury could infer the defendant is\r\n  guilty of the lesser-included offense, rather than the crime charged, the trial\r\n  judge must instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense.Â  Dempsey v.\r\n    State, 363 S.C. 365, 371, 610 S.E.2d 812, 815 (2005) (&quot;[A] judge is required to charge a jury on a lesser-included offense 'if there is\r\n  any evidence from which it could be inferred the lesser, rather\r\n    than the greater, offense was committed.'&quot; (quoting State v.\r\n      Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 242 (1996))).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, we review the decisions of the trial court only for errors of\r\n  law.Â  State v. Gibson, 390 S.C. 347, 353, 701 S.E.2d 766, 769 (Ct. App.\r\n  2010).Â  Therefore, in the context of a trial court's decision not to charge a\r\n  requested lesser-included offense, we review the trial court's decision de novo.\r\n  Â We must reverse and remand for a new trial if the evidence in the record is\r\n  such that the jury could have found the defendant guilty of the lesser offense\r\n  instead of the crime charged.\r\nThere\r\n  is evidence in the record Gilmore committed ABHAN.[1]Â \r\n  For example, the victim testified Gilmore slapped her &quot;pretty hard&quot; in\r\n  the face two or three times, and a nurse testified the victim had swelling on\r\n  the side of her face. Â The victim also testified Gilmore grabbed her after the\r\n  rape and after he washed up, and thus prevented her from leaving the house. Â See State v. Whitten, 375 S.C. 43, 46, 649 S.E.2d 505, 507 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (stating &quot;'ABHAN is the\r\n  unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation,'&quot; including &quot;'the\r\n  intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, . . . [and] a\r\n  difference in gender'&quot; (quoting State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266,\r\n  274, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516-17 (2000))).Â  The\r\n  mere existence of evidence of ABHAN, however, is not sufficient to require the jury\r\n  charge.Â  Rather, there must be evidence the defendant committed ABHAN instead\r\n    of CSC. Â Dempsey, 363 S.C. at 371, 610 S.E.2d at 815.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  courts have identified three types of cases in which the evidence can support\r\n  an inference that the defendant is guilty of ABHAN instead of CSC: (1) there is\r\n  evidence the defendant committed ABHAN by an unlawful sexual touching in the\r\n  course of attempting CSC, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether the\r\n  defendant accomplished sexual battery; see, e.g., State v. Pressly,\r\n  292 S.C. 9, 9-10, 354 S.E.2d 777, 777 (1987); State v. Mathis, 287 S.C.\r\n  589, 594, 340 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1986); (2) there is evidence the defendant\r\n  committed a nonsexual ABHAN, such as in a fight, and in addition to evidence to\r\n  support CSC, there is evidence the two never had sex; see, e.g., State\r\n    v. Lambright, 279 S.C. 535, 537, 309 S.E.2d 7, 8 (1983); and (3) there is\r\n  evidence the defendant committed a nonsexual ABHAN contemporaneous with CSC,\r\n  but there is evidence that instead of CSC the two had consensual sex; see,\r\n    e.g., State v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (2004).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this third type of case, which this case involves, the evidence must support\r\n  the existence of two conditions before the trial judge is required to charge\r\n  the jury on the lesser-included offense of ABHAN.Â  First, the nonsexual ABHAN\r\n  must have occurred &quot;contemporaneously&quot; with the alleged CSC.Â  Compare White, 361 S.C. at 412-13, 605 S.E.2d at 542-43 (ABHAN charge required\r\n  because ABHAN occurred &quot;contemporaneously&quot; with alleged CSC) with Dempsey, 363 S.C. at 371, 610 S.E.2d at 815 (evidence of ABHAN on\r\n  occasions not contemporaneous with alleged CSC did not warrant ABHAN charge).Â \r\n  Second, there must be evidence that the victim consented to have sex.Â  This\r\n  requirement is illustrated in our opinion in State v. White, 353 S.C.\r\n  566, 572, 578 S.E.2d 728, 731 (Ct. App. 2003), and in the supreme court's\r\n  opinion affirming.Â  361 S.C. at 413, 605 S.E.2d at 543.Â  In White, it was\r\n  not possible for the defendant to be guilty of ABHAN instead of CSC\r\n  unless there was evidence of consensual sex.Â  361 S.C. at 412, 605 S.E.2d at\r\n  543.[2]Â \r\n  Without evidence of consent, the ABHAN would have been in addition to CSC.Â  See id. \r\nThe\r\n  rationale for both of the required conditions is that if either condition does\r\n  not exist, the evidence will not support the inference the ABHAN occurred instead\r\n    of the CSC.Â  Rather, if either condition does not exist, the ABHAN necessarily\r\n  occurred in addition to the CSC.Â  In this case, the evidence supports\r\n  the existence of the first condition: the ABHAN was contemporaneous.Â  Gilmore\r\n  slapped the victim within minutes before, and &quot;grabbed&quot; her within\r\n  minutes after, the alleged CSC.[3]Â \r\n  The second question is much more difficult. Â However, we find insufficient\r\n  evidence to support a finding of consensual sex.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  all of the cases in which our appellate courts have found evidence of\r\n  consensual sex, the defendant testified directly that the sex was consensual.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., White, 361 S.C. at 412, 605 S.E.2d at 543 (&quot;White's testimony that he and the victim\r\n  engaged in consensual sex, the victim stabbed him, and he hit the victim in the\r\n  eye, is evidence from which the jury could infer White committed ABHAN rather\r\n  than CSC.&quot;).Â  Here, however, Gilmore\r\n  did not testify.Â  The only other eyewitness to the alleged CSC was the victim,\r\n  who testified the sex was not consensual.Â  Therefore there is no direct\r\n  evidence that the victim consented to have sex.[4]Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  there is no direct evidence that the victim consented to sex, we must determine\r\n  whether circumstantial evidence of consensual sex required the charge on ABHAN.Â \r\n  In making this determination, we are mindful that our conclusion must be based\r\n  on the existence of evidence, and not simply on the possibility that the jury\r\n  might not have believed the evidence offered by the State.Â  See State\r\n    v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 232, 522 S.E.2d 845, 854 (Ct. App. 1999) (On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict\r\n  motion, the court stated &quot;[i]t is irrelevant that the jury might have disbelieved any\r\n  portion of the evidence because that involves the weight of the evidence.&quot;); State v. Franks, 376 S.C. 621, 624, 658 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (&quot;'The mere contention that the jury might\r\n  accept the State's evidence in part and reject it in part is insufficient to\r\n  satisfy the requirement that some evidence tend to show the defendant was\r\n  guilty of only the lesser offense.'&quot; (quoting State v. Geiger,\r\n  370 S.C. 600, 608, 635 S.E.2d 669, 674 (Ct. App. 2006))). Â \r\nIn a\r\n  case such as White, where there is direct evidence of consent, the trial\r\n  court, and this court on review, must use the any evidence standard to\r\n  determine whether the requested charge should be given.Â  361 S.C. at 412, 605\r\n  S.E.2d at 542.Â  On the other hand, in a purely circumstantial evidence case\r\n  such as this one,[5] the existence of &quot;any&quot; circumstantial evidence would not necessitate\r\n  the charge on ABHAN.Â  The situation is analogous to determining when purely\r\n  circumstantial evidence requires the denial of a directed verdict.Â  Our courts\r\n  have held that the trial court must deny the directed verdict motion and submit\r\n  the case to the jury &quot;'[i]f\r\n  there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the\r\n    guilt of the accused.'&quot;Â  State v. Brandt, 393 S.C. 526, 542, 713 S.E.2d 591, 599 (2011) (emphasis\r\n  added) (quoting State v. Weston, 362 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641,\r\n  648 (2006)).Â  We find we should use the same standard for circumstantial\r\n  evidence in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence on a lesser-included\r\n  offense.Â  See Geiger, 370 S.C. at\r\n  607, 635 S.E.2d at 673 (&quot;To justify charging the\r\n  lesser crime, the evidence presented must allow a rational inference the\r\n  defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.Â  . . .Â  The\r\n  court looks to the totality of evidence in evaluating whether such an inference\r\n  has been created.&quot; (citing State\r\n    v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 21-22, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;Due process requires that a lesser included offense be\r\n  charged when the evidence warrants it but only if the evidence would permit a\r\n  jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense.&quot;))).Â \r\n  When the evidence supporting a request for a charge on a lesser-included\r\n  offense is purely circumstantial, we examine the record to determine if there\r\n  is sufficient circumstantial evidence to permit a reasonable inference that the\r\n  defendant is guilty only of the lesser crime.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  note initially that Gilmore's counsel conceded the two had sex.Â  However, the\r\n  theme of counsel's opening statement, cross-examination, and closing argument\r\n  was to highlight evidence the sex was consensual.Â  On appeal, Gilmore argues\r\n  the following evidence supported that theme and permitted a reasonable\r\n  inference the victim consented to have sex.Â  First, the events occurred in the\r\n  context of the victim going to Gilmore's house purportedly to check on her\r\n  furniture, but staying for hours alone with him.Â  The victim testified she knew\r\n  Gilmore wanted to get back together with her, and they talked about it that\r\n  afternoon.Â  The victim denied any such interest, but defense counsel elicited\r\n  testimony on cross-examination which indicated she was thinking about getting\r\n  back together with Gilmore as well.[6]Â \r\n  After being at Gilmore's house for some time, the victim gave Gilmore money to\r\n  buy a bottle of gin, which they drank together.Â  At some point during all of\r\n  this, Gilmore gave the victim a foot massage.Â  Finally, a nurse testified the\r\n  medical examination of the victim's genital area by the doctor and the nurse\r\n  indicated no evidence of sexual trauma.[7] Â Â \r\nIssues\r\n  involving circumstantial evidence present unique challenges, &quot;requir[ing] careful reasoning by the trier\r\n  of facts.&quot;Â  State v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 87, 489 S.E.2d 462, 466\r\n  (1997) (Toal, J., concurring) (quoting People v. Ford, 488 N.E.2d 458,\r\n  465 (N.Y. 1985)).Â  &quot;[A]nalysis of circumstantial evidence is a more\r\n  intellectual process, requiring jurors to engage in lawyer-like scrutiny and\r\n  forcing them to see both sides.&quot;Â  327 S.C. at 87-88, 489 S.E.2d at 466\r\n  (Toal, J., concurring) (quoting Irene Rosenberg and Yale Rosenberg, &quot;Perhaps\r\n    What Ye Say Is Based Only On Conjecture&quot;â€”Circumstantial Evidence, Then and\r\n    Now, 31 Hous. L. Rev. 1371, 1412 (1995)).Â  Similarly, we may not base our decision on appeal on the strength\r\n  of the evidence that Gilmore committed CSC.Â  Rather, we must consider both\r\n  sides.Â  We must examine the record to determine whether sufficient circumstantial\r\n  evidence exists to support a reasonable inference that Gilmore and the victim\r\n  had consensual sex, and thus that Gilmore is guilty of ABHAN instead of CSC.Â  Viewing\r\n  all of the evidence in the light most favorable to Gilmore,[8] we find there is not sufficient evidence of consensual sex to permit the jury\r\n  to reasonably conclude that Gilmore was guilty only of ABHAN.Â  The trial judge\r\n  correctly refused to give the ABHAN charge.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Admissibility of Gilmore's\r\n  Statements\r\nThe\r\n  victim testified that Gilmore made two statements to her as he was preparing to\r\n  rape her: &quot;If I was like I was, Bitch, I would have killed you.Â  You would\r\n  be a dead Bitch,&quot; and &quot;I've killed one, and I'll kill again.&quot;Â \r\n  Gilmore objected to the statements under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  We find the trial\r\n  judge acted within her discretion to admit the statements.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the statements were offered to prove what happened in this\r\n  case, not to prove some other crime, wrong, or act.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  Thus,\r\n  the State argues, the statements were admissible as part of the res gestae.[9]Â \r\n  Our courts have recognized that the State may prove the actions of the\r\n  defendant when those actions are part of the crime, not separate.Â  See State v. Owens,\r\n  346 S.C. 637, 652, 552 S.E.2d 745, 753 (2001) (stating &quot;the res gestae theory\r\n  recognizes evidence of other bad acts may be an integral part of the crime with\r\n  which the defendant is charged or may be needed to aid the fact finder in\r\n  understanding the context in which the crime occurred&quot;), overruled on other\r\n    grounds by Gentry, 363 S.C. at 106, 610 S.E.2d at 501.Â  Here, the\r\n  State offered the statements to prove how Gilmore subdued the victim in order\r\n  to commit the rape.Â  The trial judge acted within her discretion to admit the statements\r\n  as part of the crime.Â  \r\nGilmore\r\n  argues, however, that even though the statements may be part of the crime, evidence\r\n  of the previous killing described in one of the statements is evidence of an\r\n  &quot;other crime,&quot; and therefore inadmissible under Rule 404(b).Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  The focus of a court's inquiry in determining admissibility of\r\n  evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts under Rule 404(b) is the purpose for\r\n  which the evidence is offered.Â  See Rule 404(b), SCRE (&quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is\r\n  not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith.&quot;).Â  If the evidence is offered for the prohibited\r\n  purpose of &quot;prov[ing] the character of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith,&quot; Rule 404(b) excludes it.Â  However, if the evidence\r\n  is offered for one of the other purposes listed in the second sentence of Rule\r\n  404(b), the rule does not exclude it.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE (&quot;It may,\r\n  however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common\r\n  scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.&quot;).Â  We\r\n  believe the trial judge acted within her discretion to conclude the statements\r\n  were not offered for the prohibited purpose of proving Gilmore's character\r\n  &quot;in order to show action in conformity therewith,&quot; but rather were\r\n  offered to prove intent.Â  See State v. Fletcher, 379 S.C. 17, 23,\r\n  664 S.E.2d 480, 483 (2008) (&quot;To be admissible, the bad act must logically\r\n  relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.&quot;).Â  The trial\r\n  judge properly concluded the statements were admissible.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Other Issues\r\nGilmore raises two other issues on appeal.Â  We find\r\n  that neither of the issues are preserved, and decline to address them.Â  As to\r\n  whether the judge erred in excluding evidence of Gilmore's prior conviction: State\r\n    v. Elmore, 368 S.C. 230, 238, 628 S.E.2d 271, 275 (Ct. App. 2006) (adhering\r\n  to the rule that when a defendant does not testify he fails to preserve\r\n  pretrial rulings on impeachment); see also State v. Glenn, 285\r\n  S.C. 384, 385, 330 S.E.2d 285, 286 (1985).Â  As to whether the judge erred in\r\n  allowing witness testimony: State v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305, 315-16, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 582, 588 (2007) (holding an issue conceded in the trial court cannot be\r\n  argued on appeal); State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 50-51, 476 S.E.2d 683,\r\n  687 (1996) (finding a defendant was found to have waived his right to complain\r\n  of inadequate time to review discovery after the trial court granted an\r\n  approximately thirty-hour delay when the defendant sought no further time,\r\n  expressly conceded he was ready to proceed with trial, and proceeded without\r\n  further objection).Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\n For the\r\n  reasons stated above, Gilmore's conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The State essentially conceded this at trial, stating\r\n  &quot;the slap is a totally separateâ€”it's a separate charge.Â  I guess we could\r\n  have charged him with either . . . CDV or an ABHAN or hitting her.&quot;\r\n[2] To illustrate this\r\n  requirement, the supreme court compared the facts of White to the facts\r\n  this court addressed in State\r\n    v. Fields, 356 S.C. 517, 589 S.E.2d\r\n  792 (Ct. App. 2003), in which we upheld the trial judge's decision not to\r\n  charge ABHAN where there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of consensual sex.Â  White,\r\n  361 S.C. at 412-13, 605 S.E.2d at 543; see Fields, 356 S.C. at\r\n  523, 589 S.E.2d at 795 (&quot;Although defense counsel suggested in opening\r\n  remarks that the sex was consensual, no evidence was presented at trial to\r\n  support this assertion.&quot;).\r\n[3] The facts of White demonstrate that\r\n  &quot;contemporaneous&quot; includes at least events that occur within minutes\r\n  of the alleged CSC.Â  361 S.C. at 412-13,\r\n  605 S.E.2d at 542-43.\r\n[4] We recognize the victim testified she was raped, and\r\n  thus there is direct evidence that there was no consensual sex.Â  However, a\r\n  jury charge on ABHAN in this type of CSC case is not required unless there is\r\n  evidence that consensual sex did occur.Â  In reviewing a circuit court's ruling\r\n  on whether to charge ABHAN under these circumstances, we do not consider the\r\n  strength, or even the existence, of evidence to the contrary.\r\n[5] By &quot;purely circumstantial evidence case,&quot;\r\n  we mean the evidence that the victim consented to sex is purely\r\n  circumstantial.Â  As stated in footnote 4, there is direct evidence the victim\r\n  did not consent to sex.Â  There is also direct evidence that Gilmore used\r\n  aggravated force to accomplish sexual battery, and thus that he is guilty of\r\n  CSC.\r\n[6] Several\r\n  witnesses testified the victim was jealous of the other women who stopped by\r\n  that day.Â  The victim admitted she asked Gilmore if either of them were his new\r\n  girlfriend.Â  \r\n[7] We are aware of this court's statement in Geiger:\r\n  &quot;It is inconsequential that there was no\r\n  forensic evidence of sexual assault.&quot;Â  370 S.C. at 611, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  at 675.Â  However, we do not believe this statement forecloses our consideration\r\n  of this circumstance.Â  We distinguish Geiger on this point for three\r\n  reasons.Â  First, the defendant was not charged with CSC, but rather with\r\n  assault with intent to commit CSC.Â  Second, we also found in Geiger that\r\n  the victim's &quot;injuries were consistent with the victim's\r\n  narrative of the events.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Third, the issue in Geiger was not whether there was consent, but whether there was evidence the defendant\r\n  did not attempt a CSC.Â  We also acknowledge the State's position that the\r\n  results of the forensic examination should be characterized as &quot;no\r\n  evidence,&quot; and should not be considered the existence of evidence.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  The nurse and a doctor performed a medical examination and the nurse\r\n  testified to the results of the examination.Â  Her testimony that neither she\r\n  nor the doctor found any injuries resulting from sexual trauma is the existence\r\n  of one circumstance relating to the question of whether the sex was\r\n  consensual.Â  However, even when considered along with the other circumstantial\r\n  evidence in this case, this circumstance is not sufficient to permit a\r\n  reasonable inference the sex was consensual.\r\n[8] See State v. Hernandez, 386 S.C. 655,\r\n  660, 690 S.E.2d 582, 585 (Ct. App. 2010) (&quot;In determining whether the evidence requires a [lesser-included] charge . . . , the . . . court views the facts in a light most favorable to the defendant.&quot;).\r\n[9] Before the adoption of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence in 1995, the latin term &quot;res gestae&quot; meant two\r\n  things.Â  First, the term described an exception to the rule against hearsay,\r\n  essentially a combination of the present sense impression and excited utterance\r\n  exceptions now found in Rules 803(1) and (2).Â  See Rule 803, SCRE, Note\r\n  (citing State v. Harrison, 298 S.C. 333, 380 S.E.2d 818 (1989)).Â  The\r\n  term is no longer used to describe a hearsay exception.Â  Second, res gestae meant the evidence was part of the body of the crime.Â  See Black's\r\n    Law Dictionary 1173 (5th ed. 1979) (&quot;'Res gestae' means\r\n  literally things or things happened . . . .&quot;).Â  Under the Rules of\r\n  Evidence, which do not use the term, arguing an event is part of the res\r\n    gestae is equivalent to arguing the evidence is not an &quot;other&quot;\r\n  act under Rule 404(b), but rather is integral to the crime or event.Â  Our\r\n  courts have continued to use the term to describe details of a crime or event\r\n  which are not to be excluded as &quot;other crimes, wrongs, or acts&quot; under\r\n  Rule 404(b).Â  See State v. Wiles, 383 S.C. 151, 158-59, 679\r\n  S.E.2d 172, 176 (2009) (stating &quot;evidence of\r\n  other crimes which supplies the context of the crime, or is intimately\r\n  connected with and explanatory of the crime charged, is admissible as res gestae evidence&quot;) (citing State v.

Â Carrier was allowed to bill or\r\n  refund Employer for the difference between the final premium and the estimated\r\n  premium.Â  On August 8, 2007, Carrier executed a final audit\r\n  resulting in an invoice to Employer for an additional payment of $1,440\r\n  for the policy period of June 2006 through June 2007.Â  \r\nIn the meantime,\r\n  Carrier renewed the policy for the subsequent period of June\r\n  2007 through June 2008, and Employer paid an estimated premium of $24,463\r\n  through Johnson &amp; Johnson Preferred Financing.Â  After Carrier conducted the\r\n  final audit for the 2006-2007\r\n  policy, Carrier used the information from the audit for an endorsement\r\n  to the 2007-08 policy to reflect a more accurate annual premium basis.Â  On\r\n  August 10, 2007, Carrier sent Employer a notice of an additional premium due in\r\n  the amount of $4,862 to supplement the estimated premium Employer had already\r\n  paid for the 2007-08 policy period.Â  \r\nOn September 4,\r\n  2007, Carrier sent a notice cancelling the 2007-08\r\n  policy based on Employer's failure to pay the additional amounts\r\n  billed for the 2006-07 policy and the 2007-08 policy.Â  The notice advised\r\n  Employer that the 2007-08 policy would be cancelled on October 10, 2007 if the\r\n  additional premiums were not paid by then.Â  Employer made partial payments on\r\n  November 8, 2007 and November 15, 2007, but Employer did not pay the remaining\r\n  amount due until November 26, 2007.Â  Carrier then reinstated the 2007-08\r\n  policy, effective November 27, 2007; however, there was a lapse in coverage from October 10, 2007 through November 26, 2007.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nOn January 15,\r\n  2008, Claimant filed a Form 50/Employee's Notice of Claim and/or Request for\r\n  Hearing with the Workers' Compensation Commission, alleging he injured his left\r\n  leg and lower back on November 5, 2007, while working\r\n  for Employer.Â  On February 8, 2008, Carrier filed a Form 51/Employer's Answer\r\n  to Request for Hearing denying it had provided\r\n  coverage for Employer on the date of Claimant's injury.Â  The 2007-08 policy was later cancelled\r\n  in April 2008 due to safety violations and was not reinstated.Â  On\r\n  June 9, 2008, Carrier paid Johnson &amp; Johnson a premium refund in the amount of $15,471\r\n  for the 2007-08 policy.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the single commissioner, Employer argued (1) the 2007-08 policy was not\r\n  properly cancelled on October 10, 2007, because Carrier\r\n  had no right to endorse the 2007-08 policy based on the August 8, 2007 audit;\r\n  and (2) the reasons for cancellation of the policy were not proper\r\n  because the required premiums had been paid, and\r\n  no premiums were refunded for the period of the alleged lapse in coverage.Â  The\r\n  single commissioner concluded Carrier properly cancelled the 2007-08 policy,\r\n  resulting in a lapse in coverage at the time of Claimant's injury.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Appellate\r\n  Panel affirmed the single commissioner's order and held Employer directly\r\n  responsible for paying benefits to Claimant.Â  In its decision, the Appellate\r\n  Panel concluded the Assigned Risk Supplement to the Basic Manual for Workers'\r\n  Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance (NCCI 2006) (&quot;Assigned\r\n  Risk Supplement&quot;) permitted the premium endorsement to the 2007-08\r\n  policy.Â  The Appellate Panel also concluded Carrier properly cancelled\r\n  Employer's coverage for non-payment of premiums and there existed a lapse in\r\n  coverage from October 10, 2007, through November 26, 2007.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n       Did\r\n  the Appellate Panel correctly conclude the Assigned Risk Supplement authorized the\r\n  premium endorsement to the 2007-08 policy?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       Did\r\n  the Appellate Panel err in concluding Carrier properly cancelled Employer's\r\n  coverage?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n       Did\r\n  the Appellate Panel err in concluding a lapse in Employerâ€™s workers'\r\n  compensation coverage occurred from October 10, 2007, through November 26, 2007?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act\r\n  establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions by the Appellate\r\n  Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission. Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276\r\n  S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Â Specifically, section 1-23-380\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) provides this court may not substitute\r\n  its judgment for the Appellate Panel's judgment as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse when the decision is affected by\r\n  an error of law.[2] Â See  Hamilton v.\r\n    Bob Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 76,\r\n  518 S.E.2d 599, 600-01 (Ct. App. 1999), modified on other grounds, 339\r\n  S.C. 68, 528 S.E.2d 667 (2000), overruled on other grounds, Allison\r\n    v. W.L. Gore &amp; Assocs, 714 S.E.2d 547 (2011) (interpreting\r\n  section 1-23-380).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Authority for Premium Endorsement\r\nEmployer maintains the\r\n  Appellate Panel incorrectly concluded that the Assigned Risk Supplement\r\n  authorized Carrierâ€™s premium endorsement to the 2007-08 policy.Â  Employer\r\n  argues the policy did not permit a premium endorsement before the final audit\r\n  at the end of the policy period because: (1) the policy's specific language\r\n  states: &quot;The final premium will be determined after this policy ends&quot;;\r\n  (2) there is no language in the policy informing Employer that the policy's terms\r\n  are subject to the Assigned Risk Supplement; and (3) the language of the\r\n  Assigned Risk Supplement did not require Carrier to issue a premium endorsement.Â \r\n  We address each of these arguments in turn.\r\nA.&nbsp; Policy\r\n  Language\r\nEmployer contends the policy did\r\n  not permit a premium endorsement before the final audit at the end of the\r\n  policy period because the policy required the final premium to be determined after the\r\n  policy had ended. Â Employer also argues the &quot;Information Page&quot; for\r\n  the policy indicated that the audit period was annual; and, therefore, the\r\n  policy prohibited Carrier from issuing an interim premium endorsement.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\nEmployerâ€™s policy\r\n  states the following regarding the premium:\r\n  \r\nAll premium[s] for this policy will be determined by our manuals\r\n  of rules, rates, rating plans and classifications.Â  We may change our manuals\r\n  and apply the changes to this policy if authorized by law or a governmental\r\n  agency regulating this insurance.\r\n. . . .\r\nItem 4 of the Information Page shows the rate and premium basis\r\n  for certain business or work classifications.Â  These classifications were\r\n  assigned based on an estimate of the exposures you would have during the policy\r\n  period.Â  If your actual exposures are not properly described by those\r\n  classifications, we will assign proper classifications, rates and premium basis\r\n  by endorsement to this policy.\r\n  \r\n\r\n2007-08\r\n  Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance Policy, Part Five,\r\n  sections A &amp; B.Â  These policy provisions are consistent with the Assigned\r\n  Risk Supplementâ€™s requirement for a premium endorsement to an assigned risk policy\r\n  when a carrier discovers information indicating the need to more accurately\r\n  reflect the exposure base or classification of the policyholder:\r\n\r\n1)&nbsp; The\r\n  carrier will periodically review the operations of the insured\r\n  throughout the policy period to determine if the correct classification and/or\r\n  payroll information is being used.Â  If subsequent to assignment and/or\r\n  initial policy issuance, the carrier discovers or receives, either\r\n  through interim audit, endorsement request, claim information, loss\r\n  prevention survey, or other means, verifiable:\r\n  \r\na)&nbsp; Payroll information that is not consistent with the annual\r\n  exposure base as assigned or \r\nb)&nbsp; Classification information that raises doubt concerning the\r\n  accuracy of the policyâ€™s classification(s)\r\n  \r\n[t]he carrier must investigate and make a determination within\r\n  thirty (30) days of the carrierâ€™s knowledge whether an endorsement to the\r\n    policy is needed to accurately reflect the exposure base and/or\r\n    classification(s) of the policyholder.\r\n2)&nbsp; The\r\n  carrier must use sound underwriting judgment using the latest available audit\r\n  information to develop [a] current policy premium.\r\n\r\nAssigned Risk\r\n  Supplement to the Basic Manual for Workers' Compensation and Employers'\r\n  Liability Insurance Â§ 2(D)(7)(b)(2)(a) (NCCI 2006) (emphasis added). Â \r\nSignificantly, the\r\n  Assigned Risk Plan, which includes the Assigned Risk Supplement, has the force of\r\n  law:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n  General Assembly has delegated certain authority over assigned-risk insurance\r\n  to the Director of the Department of Insurance. Â South Carolina Code section 38-73-540(A)(1) states that â€œany mechanism designed\r\n  to implementâ€ the assigned-risk agreement executed by the state's insurers\r\n  â€œmust be submitted in writing to the director or his designee for approval\r\n  prior to use, together with such additional information as the director or his\r\n  designee may reasonably require.â€ Â The Code does not require that the\r\n  implementation mechanism be promulgated as a regulation. Â Rather, the\r\n    mechanism attains the force of law when it is approved by the Director of the\r\n    Department of Insurance.\r\nMoreover, the provisions of the Plan prevail over the workers' compensation\r\n  regulations. Â Code\r\n  section 38-73-540 specifically addresses\r\n  assigned-risk insurance and the mechanism for implementing assigned-risk\r\n  agreements, whereas the regulations address workers' compensation generally. Â The\r\n  principle that more specific rules prevail over general ones applies, and the\r\n  Plan is the product of a more specific statute. Â The Plan controls with\r\n    respect to issues it addresses.\r\n\r\nAvant\r\n  v. Willowglen Acad., 367 S.C. 315, 319, 626 S.E.2d 797, 799 (2006) (citations\r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).\r\n The\r\n  policy provision cited by Employer, i.e. Part Five, section E, governs the amount\r\n  of the final premium and when it will be determined, as does the Information Page indicating that the audit period is annual; these provisions are not necessarily inconsistent with the specific provisions in\r\n  the policy and the Assigned Risk Supplement authorizing a premium endorsement when\r\n  necessary to reflect actual exposures.Â  In any event, to the extent the final\r\n  premium provision and the information page are inconsistent with the Assigned\r\n  Risk Supplement, the Assigned Risk Supplement controls.Â  See Avant,\r\n  367 S.C. at 319, 626 S.E.2d at 799 (holding the Assigned Risk Plan attains the\r\n  force of law when approved by the Insurance Director).Â  Therefore, the Â policy\r\n  provisions did not prohibit Carrier from issuing the premium endorsement in\r\n  this case.\r\nB.&nbsp; Assigned\r\n  Risk Supplement\r\nEmployer also contends there\r\n  is no language in the policy informing Employer that the policy's terms are\r\n  subject to the Assigned Risk Supplement, and, therefore, Employer is not\r\n  subject to the Assigned Risk Supplementâ€™s provisions.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nInitially, this specific\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review because Employer did not\r\n  specifically raise this point in its Statement of Issues on Appeal.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the court need not consider it.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no\r\n  point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues\r\n  on appeal.&quot;).\r\nAs to the merits of\r\n  this issue, undisputed evidence in the record indicates Employerâ€™s policy was\r\n  an assigned risk policy provided by Carrier pursuant to the Assigned Risk Plan.[3]Â  The Assigned Risk Plan, which\r\n  includes the Assigned Risk Supplement, is controlling law with respect to the\r\n  issues it addresses.Â  Avant, 367 S.C. at 319, 626 S.E.2d at\r\n  799.Â  Further, the policy specifically states that any of its terms conflicting\r\n  with the workers' compensation law are changed to conform to the law.Â  2007-08\r\n  Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance Policy, Part One,\r\n  section H(6).Â  Therefore, the policy placed Employer on notice that it was\r\n  subject to the Assigned Risk Supplement. \r\nC.&nbsp; Premium\r\n  Endorsement\r\nEmployer also argues the language of\r\n  the Assigned Risk Supplement did not require Carrier to issue a premium\r\n  endorsement because the additional premium generated by the August 8, 2007 audit did\r\n  not reach 25% of the estimated annual premium. Â We disagree.\r\nThe Assigned Risk\r\n  Supplement states that a carrier must issue an additional premium endorsement\r\n  if the additional premium generated by an audit is at least $500 or 25% of the\r\n  estimated annual premium, whichever is greater.Â  Assigned Risk Supplement to the\r\n  Basic Manual for Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance Â§\r\n  2(D)(7)(b)(2)(b) (NCCI 2006). Â The additional premium for\r\n  the 2007-08 policy, $4,862, was\r\n  less than 25% of the estimated annual premium.Â  The estimated annual premium for\r\n  the 2007-08 policy period was $24,463.Â  Twenty-five percent of this annual\r\n  premium is $6,115.75.Â  \r\nHowever, another\r\n  provision of the Assigned Risk Supplement requires Carrier to &quot;investigate\r\n  and make a determination . . . whether an endorsement to the policy is needed\r\n  to accurately reflect the exposure base and/or classification(s) of the\r\n  policyholder.&quot;Â  Assigned\r\n  Risk Supplement to the Basic Manual for Workers' Compensation and Employers'\r\n  Liability Insurance Â§ 2(D)(7)(b)(2)(a) (NCCI 2006). Â This\r\n  language authorizes the carrier to exercise its discretion as to when a premium\r\n  endorsement is necessary.Â  Further, the Assigned Risk Supplement requires the\r\n  carrier to use sound underwriting judgment using the latest available audit\r\n  information to develop a current policy premium.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, at the\r\n  very least, the Assigned Risk Supplement authorized, if not required, Carrier\r\n  to issue a premium endorsement to Employer's 2007-08 policy despite the fact\r\n  that the endorsement did not represent 25% of the estimated premium.Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the Appellate Panel properly concluded the Assigned\r\n  Risk Supplement authorized the premium endorsement to the 2007-08 policy.\r\nII.&nbsp; Cancellation of Coverage\r\nEmployer asserts the Appellate Panel\r\n  erred in concluding Carrier properly cancelled Employer's coverage because: (1)\r\n  the premium endorsement requiring Employer to pay an additional amount of funds\r\n  was invalid for lack of a signature; and (2) Carrier failed to timely return\r\n  the unearned portion of the premium paid by Employer.Â  We address each of these\r\n  arguments in turn.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Unsigned Endorsement\r\n Employer\r\n  contends the\r\n  premium endorsement requiring Employer to pay additional funds was invalid for\r\n  lack of a signature.Â  However, Employer does not cite any authority for this\r\n  proposition or present any further discussion in its brief for this conclusory statement.Â \r\n  Therefore, Employer has abandoned this point.Â  See State v. Garner,\r\n  389 S.C. 61, 67, 697 S.E.2d 615, 618 (Ct. App. 2010) (recognizing an argument is deemed abandoned on appeal when\r\n    it is merely conclusory and made without supporting authority).Â \r\n  Further, this specific point is not listed in the Statement of Issues on\r\n  Appeal.Â  Therefore, the court need not address it.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not\r\n  set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot;). Â Â \r\nB.&nbsp; Unearned\r\n  premium\r\nEmployer argues Carrier did not\r\n  properly cancel the policy because Carrier failed to timely return the unearned\r\n  portion of the premium paid by Employer.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn September 4, 2007, Carrier\r\n  sent a notice of cancellation of the 2007-08 policy based on Employer's failure\r\n  to pay the amounts billed by Carrier for both the 2006-07 policy and the 2007-08\r\n  policy.Â  The notice advised Employer that the 2007-08 policy would be cancelled\r\n  on October 10, 2007, if the additional premiums were not paid by then.Â \r\n  Employer made partial payments on November 8, 2007, and November 15, 2007, but\r\n  Employer did not pay the remaining amount due until November 26, 2007, well\r\n  after the October 10th deadline.Â  Carrier then reinstated the 2007-08\r\n  policy, effective November 27, 2007, with a lapse in coverage from October 10,\r\n  2007, through November 26, 2007.\r\nUnrelated to premiums, the 2007-08\r\n  policy was cancelled a second time in April 2008, due to safety violations, and\r\n  it was never reinstated.Â  On June 9, 2008, Carrier paid Employer's lender a\r\n  premium refund in the amount of $15,471 for the 2007-08 policy.Â  Carrier did\r\n  not charge premiums to Employer for the period of lapse, October 10, 2007,\r\n  through November 26, 2007. Â Rather, Carrier adjusted the premium to account for\r\n  the lapse in coverage in determining Employer's refund following the final\r\n  audit.Â  Further, Employer admits in its brief that Carrier returned any\r\n  unearned premium after the final audit.Â  \r\nAlthough Carrier did not send the\r\n  refund to Employer's lender until June 2008, there are no provisions in the\r\n  policy requiring Carrier to return any unearned premium immediately upon cancellation\r\n  of the policy.Â  The policy's cancellation provision allows the final premium to\r\n  be calculated &quot;pro rata based on the time [the] policy was in force.&quot;Â  2007-08 Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance\r\n  Policy, Part\r\n  V, Section E(1) (&quot;Final Premium&quot;).Â  Therefore, the timing of any\r\n  refund is tied to the calculation of the final premium. Â This calculation is\r\n  not required to be performed until &quot;after the policy ends,&quot; so\r\n  that Carrier may obtain accurate information on &quot;the actual, not the\r\n  estimated, premium basis and the proper classifications and rates that lawfully\r\n  apply to the business and work covered by th[e] policy.&quot;Â  2007-08\r\n  Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance Policy, Part V, Section\r\n  E(1) (&quot;Final Premium&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nMoreover, the calculation of the\r\n  final premium necessarily involves an audit of the employer's records, and\r\n  there is no provision requiring an audit to be conducted immediately upon\r\n  cancellation of the policy.Â  The policy section addressing audits states, in\r\n  pertinent part: &quot;We may conduct the audits during regular business hours\r\n  during the policy period and within three years after the policy period\r\n  ends.&quot;Â  2007-08 Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance\r\n  Policy, Part\r\n  V, Section G (&quot;Audit&quot;); Policy Information Page. Â Based on the\r\n  foregoing, Carrier's issuance of a refund for the lapse in coverage after\r\n  completing the audit of Employer's records in June 2008 did not violate any\r\n  policy provisions and thus did not invalidate cancellation of the policy in\r\n  October 2007.Â  Cf. Bowman v. State Roofing\r\n    Co., 365 S.C. 112, 121-22, 616 S.E.2d 699,\r\n  704 (2005) (&quot;[W]here an insurance policy provides for the return of\r\n    unearned premiums upon cancellation, the tender of a refund is a condition\r\n  precedent to an effective cancellation.&quot;) (emphasis added).[4]Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Lapse in Coverage\r\nEmployer maintains the Appellate\r\n  Panel erred in finding a lapse in Employerâ€™s coverage existed from October 10,\r\n  2007 through November 26, 2007.Â  Employer argues the estimated premium paid through\r\n  Johnson &amp; Johnson in June 2007 should have been pro-rated to provide\r\n  coverage Â for the ensuing nine months, which included the date of Claimant's accidental\r\n  injury.Â  We disagree.\r\nEmployer cites no\r\n  authority for his argument that the estimated premium should have been\r\n  pro-rated to provide coverage for the ensuing nine months.[5]Â  Therefore, Employer has abandoned\r\n  this argument.Â  See State v. Garner, 389 S.C. at 67,\r\n  697 S.E.2d at 618 (recognizing an argument is deemed\r\n  abandoned on appeal when it is merely conclusory and made without supporting\r\n  authority).Â  Nonetheless, the opinion of the Supreme Court of North\r\n  Carolina in Klein v. Avemco Ins. Co., 220 S.E.2d 595, 597 (N.C. 1975) is instructive on\r\n  this point.Â  In Klein, the court stated: &quot;'If\r\n  the premium is not paid in the manner prescribed in the policy, the policy is\r\n  forfeited. Â Partial payment, even when accepted as a partial payment, will not\r\n  keep the policy alive even for such fractional part of the year as the part\r\n  payment bears to the whole payment.'&quot;Â  220\r\n  S.E.2d at 597 (quoting Clifton v. Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., 84 S.E.\r\n  817, 818&nbsp;(1915)).\r\nHere, Employer's\r\n  policy required the initial payment of an estimated premium for coverage\r\n  throughout the 2007-08 policy year and an adjustment to the premium after a\r\n  final audit at the end of the policy period.Â  However, the policy also deferred\r\n  to applicable law, which authorized a premium endorsement to the policy during\r\n  the policy period.Â  See Assigned Risk Supplement to the Basic Manual for\r\n  Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance Â§ 2(D)(7)(b)(2)(a)\r\n  (NCCI 2006) (stating that when a carrier discovers information indicating\r\n  the need to more accurately reflect the exposure base or classification of the\r\n  policyholder, the carrier must investigate and make a determination\r\n  whether an endorsement to the policy is needed to accurately reflect the\r\n  exposure base and/or classification(s) of the policyholder). Â This\r\n  endorsement effectively restated the estimated premium, which was initially due\r\n  at the beginning of the policy period.Â  Therefore, Carrier was justified in\r\n  requiring the additional premium to be paid within approximately sixty days to\r\n  avoid cancellation of the policy.Â  \r\nFurther, because\r\n  Employer did not pay the full amount billed for the additional premium until\r\n  November 26, 2007, Carrier properly reinstated the policy with a resulting lapse\r\n  in coverage from October 10, 2007, through November 26, 2007.Â  After Carrier\r\n  determined it was necessary to issue a premium endorsement to accurately reflect\r\n  the information it obtained from the August 8, 2007 audit, the $24,463 paid by\r\n  Employer up front took on the nature of a partial payment that would not\r\n  &quot;keep the policy alive even for such fractional part of the year as the\r\n  part payment bore to the whole payment.&quot;Â  See Klein, 220\r\n  S.E.2d at 597 (quoting Clifton v. Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., 84 S.E.\r\n  817, 818&nbsp;(1915)) (&quot;'If the premium is not paid in the manner prescribed in the policy,\r\n  the policy is forfeited.

Â She\r\n    worked as a radiation therapist for twenty-four years and began her employment\r\n    with Carolinas Healthcare in July 2002.Â  Landry worked approximately 40 hours a\r\n    week and spent a majority of the work day standing on her feet.Â  Her job involved\r\n    helping patients up onto a table, moving to a control room where she would\r\n    administer radiation, and helping patients off the table. Â Landry worked\r\n    primarily on hard surfaces with the exception of rubber mats in the control\r\n    room.Â  According to Landry, after the rubber mats were removed from the control\r\n    room, she began experiencing significant pain in her feet.[1]\r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn August 2004, Landry sought treatment from Dr.\r\n  Robert van Brederode.Â  Dr. van Brederode noted at Landry's initial visit that\r\n  she suffered from bunions, which had &quot;bothered her&quot; since she was\r\n  thirteen years old. Â Dr. van Brederode diagnosed Landry with hallux\r\n  valgus deformity and hallux abductus interphalangeus deformity and casted her\r\n  for custom foot orthotics.Â  In December 2005, Dr. van Brederode performed a\r\n  bunionectomy with screw fixation on Landry's left foot.Â  Landry was out of work\r\n  from December 5, 2005, until February 6, 2006, following surgery.Â  In January\r\n  2007, Dr. van Brederode performed the same surgery on Landry's right foot. Â Upon\r\n  returning to work, Landry was informed by Carolinas Healthcare that her\r\n  employment had been terminated. Â Landry was unemployed until she found another\r\n  radiation therapist position in July 2007.Â  Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn June 2007, Landry filed a Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission Form 50 reporting an accidental injury to her feet caused by\r\n  repetitive trauma and resulting in stress fractures.Â  Dr. van Brederode noted\r\n  the conditions in Landry's feet were structural deformities which &quot;were\r\n  more likely than not aggravated by her being on her feet for long periods of\r\n  time at work, including standing and walking.&quot; Â He assigned Landry\r\n  a two percent whole person impairment rating with regard to both her left and\r\n  right foot. Â In an amended Form 50 filed in March 2008, Landry reported the\r\n  injury to her feet was a result of the aggravation of a pre-existing condition\r\n  and was the result of spending long periods of time standing on her feet. Â Thereafter,\r\n  in April 2008, Landry was examined by Dr. James Sebold.Â  Dr. Sebold opined that\r\n  Landry's bunions were not caused or aggravated by standing on her feet all day\r\n  at work.Â  He noted that bunions are caused by an anatomical variation and that\r\n  they can cause pain when standing on them or in a shoe, &quot;but that would be\r\n  with virtually any job.&quot; Â Dr. Sebold determined Landry's bunions were\r\n  &quot;in no way related to her job.&quot;\r\n  \r\n  \r\nA hearing was held before the single commissioner on\r\n  July 15, 2008.Â  At the hearing, Landry testified she was diagnosed with bunions\r\n  at age thirteen. Landry further testified that although she had\r\n  pre-existing foot problems, she had never experienced problems with either foot\r\n  that kept her out of work until she began working for Carolinas Healthcare. Â Â According\r\n  to Landry, she never experienced any pain in her feet until she went to\r\n  work for Carolinas Healthcare.Â  On cross-examination, portions of\r\n  Landry's deposition testimony were read into the record. Â In her deposition,\r\n  Landry testified she began having pain in her feet at age thirteen.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, Landry also denied having foot pain when she started working.Â  Again,\r\n  Landry was read her deposition testimony wherein she testified she suffered pain\r\n  when standing on her feet when she worked as an x-ray technician. Â Landry testified\r\n  she thought having pain in her feet was just part of doing her job. Â She\r\n  admitted she was still experiencing pain in her feet when she began working for\r\n  Carolinas Healthcare.Â  Landry also testified at the hearing that she was\r\n  treated by a podiatrist in Florida in 2001 for foot pain. Â According to\r\n  Landry, the podiatrist advised her that her condition would only get worse if\r\n  she continued to stand on her feet for long periods of time. Â Landry further testified\r\n  she knew that if she continued to stand on her feet for prolonged periods of\r\n  time her condition would worsen.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn July 23, 2008, the single commissioner determined\r\n  Landry suffered repetitive injuries to both feet arising out of and in the\r\n  course of her employment. Â The single commissioner noted that although Landry\r\n  had foot problems as a child and had seen a podiatrist in 2001, she never\r\n  missed work or had surgery due to her condition. Â The single commissioner determined\r\n  Landry sustained a five percent permanent partial disability to each foot and\r\n  awarded her $9,043.16.Â  The single commissioner also awarded Landry\r\n  temporary total disability benefits from December 5, 2006, to February 6, 2006,\r\n  and January 8, 2007, to July 19, 2007, for a total of $21,685.13. Â The\r\n  single commissioner ordered Carolinas Healthcare to pay for Landry's past causally-related\r\n  medical expenses as well as for orthotics as needed for the remainder of her\r\n  life.Â   \r\n  \r\n    Carolinas Healthcare appealed the single commissioner's order to the Appellate Panel. The Appellate\r\n    Panel reversed the single commissioner, finding Landry suffered from bunion\r\n    deformities in both feet since the age of thirteen which required treatment\r\n    prior to her employment with Carolinas Healthcare.Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n    determined Landry had knowledge, through her previous doctor, that prolonged\r\n    standing would worsen the condition in her feet, yet she continued to work in a\r\n    job that required her to stand for long periods of time.Â  Relying on Capers\r\n      v. Flautt, 305 S.C. 254, 407 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 1991) and Havird v.\r\n        Columbia YMCA, 308 S.C. 397, 418 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App. 1992), the Appellate Panel\r\n    concluded Landry &quot;did not suffer an injury by accident arising out of and\r\n    in the course of her employment . . . because the worsening of her foot\r\n    condition was not an unlooked for or untoward occurrence.&quot; Â The Appellate\r\n    Panel further found Carolinas Healthcare was not responsible for Landry's past\r\n    and future medical expenses or for any temporary total disability or permanent\r\n  partial disability benefits. Â   \r\n  \r\n    Landry appealed the Appellate Panel's order to the\r\n    circuit court. Â The circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel, holding substantial\r\n    evidence supported the Appellate Panel's findings. Â The circuit court, citing Capers and Havird, found Landry's foot condition was a pre-existing condition\r\n    and its aggravation was a &quot;by-product of the normal requirements of\r\n    performing [her] job.&quot;Â  The circuit court determined the impairment rating\r\n    assigned by Dr. van Brederode &quot;is not an impairment caused by [Landry's]\r\n    work, but rather is based on the nature of her pre-existing condition.&quot;Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â   \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW  \r\n  \r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act governs the standard of review in a workers' compensation\r\n  decision. Â Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612,\r\n  619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;In an appeal from the\r\n  Commission, neither this court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment\r\n  for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of\r\n  fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â &quot;Any review of the\r\n  [C]ommission's factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence\r\n  standard.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla\r\n  of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is\r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify\r\n  its action.&quot;Â  Liberty Mut. Ins., 363 S.C. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at\r\n  300.Â  &quot;The possibility of drawing\r\n  two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\n  administrative agency's findings from being supported by substantial evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at 301.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n\r\n    Landry argues the circuit court erred in affirming the\r\n    Appellate Panel's determination that she was not entitled to workers'\r\n    compensation benefits because she was aware that standing for long periods of\r\n    time could worsen her pre-existing foot condition.Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n    Pursuant to section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina\r\n    Workers' Compensation Act, a claimant is entitled to benefits for an\r\n    &quot;injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.&quot;Â \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;[I]n determining whether\r\n    something constitutes an injury by accident the focus is not on some specific\r\n    event, but rather on the injury itself.&quot; Â Pee v. AVM, Inc., 352\r\n    S.C. 167, 171, 573 S.E.2d 785, 787&nbsp;(2002). Â &quot;[A]n injury is\r\n    unexpected, bringing it within the category of accident, if the worker did not intend it or expect it would result from what he was doing.&quot; Â Id. Â &quot;Therefore, if an injury is unexpected from the worker's point of view,\r\n  it qualifies as an injury by accident.&quot;Â  Id.  \r\n  \r\n    Landry contends the circuit court erred in relying on Capers\r\n      v. Flautt, 305 S.C. 254, 407 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 1991) and Havird v.\r\n        Columbia YMCA, 308 S.C. 397, 418 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App. 1992) in affirming\r\n    the Appellate Panel.Â  In Capers, this court held Capers' outbreak of\r\n    contact dermatitis was not an unlooked for event that he did not expect, and\r\n    therefore, it was not accidental. Â 305 S.C. at 257, 407 S.E.2d at 662. Â The\r\n    court noted Capers, a dishwasher, was aware of his condition and had previously\r\n    left a job due to the same problem caused by exposure to detergents and water. Â Id. at 257, 407 S.E.2d at 661. Â This court found Capers' outbreak of dermatitis was\r\n    an event he could anticipate given his past experience.Â  Id. at 257, 407\r\n  S.E.2d at 662.Â   \r\n  \r\n    The Capers decision was followed by this court\r\n    in Havird.Â  Havird suffered from varicose veins which were exacerbated\r\n    by standing in a stationary position during his job as a masseuse. Â Havird,\r\n    308 S.C. at 398, 418 S.E.2d at 330. Â Havird experienced painful swelling in his\r\n    feet and underwent surgery.Â  Id.Â  Havird's surgeon warned him that\r\n    standing in one place without much movement was bad for people with varicose\r\n    veins and that he needed to stay off his feet as much as possible.Â  Id. Â After\r\n    surgery, Havird returned to work and later filed a workers' compensation claim\r\n    when his varicose veins condition worsened. Â Id. Â This court determined\r\n    Havird did not suffer an injury by accident. Â Id. at 400, 418 S.E.2d at\r\n    331. Â Specifically, this court found Havird's &quot;vascular disease was not\r\n    aggravated by unexpected or excessive exertion in the performance of his duties\r\n    or by unusual and extraordinary conditions in his employment,&quot; but rather\r\n    &quot;the worsening of his varicose veins was the natural and expected result\r\n    of working in a job that was performed while standing.&quot;Â  Id.Â  This court\r\n    noted that it is &quot;well known that prolonged standing is bad for people\r\n    with varicose veins,&quot; and that the aggravation of varicose veins is the\r\n    &quot;natural and expected result&quot; of standing in one place without much\r\n    movement.Â  Id.Â  The court further noted that Havird knew standing would\r\n  worsen his condition over time.Â  Id.  \r\n  \r\n    We disagree with Landry's assertion that the Appellate\r\n    Panel and the circuit court erred in relying on Capers and Havird.Â \r\n    While Landry argues these decisions are &quot;relatively old,&quot; they have\r\n    not been overruled and we believe they are applicable regarding the issue of\r\n    whether Landry suffered an injury by accident.Â  Landry, like Capers and Havird,\r\n    was aware of her physical condition and knew which activities would worsen her\r\n    symptoms. Â Â Â In the course of her treatment, Landry was warned by her doctor\r\n    that standing on her feet for prolonged periods of time would worsen her bunion\r\n    condition.Â  Landry testified she was aware that the amount of standing in her\r\n    occupation was hazardous to the condition of her feet, yet she continued to\r\n    work in a job that required her to stand for long periods of time.Â  Accordingly,\r\n    we find substantial evidence in the record supports the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  that the worsening of Landry's bunion condition was not unexpected.Â   \r\n  \r\n    Citing Pee, Landry also argues the Appellate\r\n    Panel and the circuit court erroneously based their decisions on the cause of\r\n    her injury and not the injury itself. Â In Pee, Employer argued Worker's\r\n    repetitive trauma injury was not compensable as an injury by accident because the\r\n    repetitive event which caused the injury was part of Worker's normal work\r\n    activity and was not unexpected. 352 S.C. at 170, 573 S.E.2d at 787. Â Our\r\n    supreme court disagreed with Employer and determined a repetitive trauma injury\r\n    met the definition of injury by accident.Â  Id. at 170, 573 S.E.2d at\r\n    787-88.Â  The court held that in determining whether something constitutes an\r\n    injury by accident, the focus should not be on the specific event causing the\r\n    injury, but rather on the injury itself.Â  Id. at 170, 573 S.E.2d at 787.Â \r\n    The court found &quot;an injury is unexpected, bringing it within the category\r\n    of accident, if the worker did not intend it or expect it would result\r\n    from what he was doing.&quot; Â Id. Â Therefore, the court determined that\r\n    &quot;[i]f an injury is unexpected from the workers' point of view, it\r\n    qualifies as an injury by accident.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Landry maintains the\r\n    Appellate Panel and the circuit court failed to consider whether she intended\r\n    or expected the injury would result from her actions.Â  She contends that here,\r\n    as in Pee, there is no evidence she reasonably intended or expected to\r\n    be injured as a result of her repetitive work activity.Â  Landry notes her\r\n    doctor only warned her that her condition would get worse if she continued to\r\n    stand on her feet, and he did not specifically advise her to change occupations\r\n  or stay off her feet.Â   \r\n  \r\n    We disagree with Landry's assertion that the Appellate\r\n    Panel and the circuit court erroneously focused on the cause of her injury and\r\n    not the injury itself. Â A review of the orders in the record shows both the\r\n    Appellate Panel and the circuit court looked to whether Landry's injury, the\r\n    worsening of her bunion condition, was an expected result of her work\r\n    activities.Â  Pursuant to Pee, an injury is unexpected, and thus an\r\n    accident, if the worker did not expect the injury would result from her\r\n    actions.Â  Here, the substantial evidence in the record supports the finding\r\n    that Landry's injury was not unexpected. Â Landry testified she had a bunion\r\n    condition before she went to work for Carolinas Healthcare, and that her doctor\r\n    in Florida warned her that her condition would worsen if she continued to stand\r\n    on her feet for long periods of time. Â Landry also testified that she knew prolonged\r\n    standing would worsen her bunion condition. Â Accordingly, we find the circuit\r\n    court did not err in affirming the Appellate Panel on the issue of\r\ncompensability.[2]Â   \r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.HUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Victoria Reich, the Administrative Director of the\r\n  Carolinas Healthcare cancer treatment facility where Landry worked, testified\r\n  the rubber pads in the control room were never removed.Â  \r\n[2] Landry also argues the circuit court's decision to\r\n  affirm the Appellate Panel was punitive.Â  We disagree.Â  This issue was\r\n  addressed in Havird.Â  There, this court stated that due to health\r\n  problems, &quot;many people have little choice but to work in pain and fatigue\r\n  or else bring their working lives to a close.&quot;Â  Havird, 308 S.C. at\r\n  400, 418 S.E.2d at 331.Â  The court noted that while it is\r\n  &quot;unfortunate&quot; that &quot;continuing to work often worsens their\r\n  health,&quot; the &quot;Workers' Compensation Law was not intended to remedy\r\n  this problem.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4906","title":"Roesler v.

Roesler (Husband), proceeding with trial when she was not\r\n  represented by an attorney, failing to make an inquiry or award of alimony, and\r\n  waiving mandatory mediation.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  on March 26, 1994, and one child (Child) was born as a result of the marriage.Â \r\n  At the beginning of the marriage, Husband was employed by the United States\r\n  Army and the couple lived in Fort Knox, Kentucky, with Wife's two children from\r\n  a previous marriage.[1]Â \r\n  In 1996, Husband voluntarily separated from the Army, and the family moved to Dallas,\r\n  Texas, where husband remained employed for the next seven years.Â  In 2003,\r\n  Husband's Texas Army National Guard unit was deployed to Iraq for a year.Â  In\r\n  2004, Husband resumed his previous employment, but left shortly thereafter to\r\n  accept a position with Kellogg, Brown, and Root (KBR), a civilian contractor\r\n  that provided logistical support to the military in Iraq.Â  Husband worked for\r\n  KBR in Iraq for approximately a year-and-a-half earning between $15,000 and $17,000\r\n  per month.Â  After returning from Iraq, Husband remained employed with KBR earning\r\n  approximately one-third of what he earned while in Iraq. \r\nFour months later, Husband's\r\n  employment with KBR was terminated.Â  Husband explained Wife's unhappiness with\r\n  him working in Iraq and Child's struggles with school caused him to miss a\r\n  substantial amount of work.Â  Afterwards, Husband worked for a short time as an\r\n  insurance salesman, but was soon hired by Fluor Corporation in Greenville,\r\n  South Carolina.Â  Fluor Corporation also provides the military with logistical\r\n  support in Iraq.Â  On September 24, 2007, Husband and Child moved into an\r\n  extended stay hotel in Greenville, South Carolina, provided by Fluor.Â  Husband's\r\n  parents, who lived in Bluffton, South Carolina, temporarily relocated to Greenville\r\n  to help Husband homeschool Child.Â  Husband explained that Wife was unhappy with\r\n  this arrangement and moved into the extended stay hotel with Husband and Child\r\n  during the first week of October 2007.\r\nIn October 2007, the family\r\n  returned to Texas to pack up their household goods.Â  According to Husband, Wife\r\n  was upset about leaving &quot;anything behind in the house.&quot;Â  Wife\r\n  insisted the pool slide, pool heater, light fixtures, door handles, two French\r\n  doors, and built-in cabinets be packed.[2]Â \r\n  Husband explained the house was in or about to enter foreclosure and &quot;the\r\n  expectation was . . . we were not going to be able to afford to stay in that\r\n  house anyhow.&quot;Â  As part of a corporate relocation program, Fluor paid a\r\n  moving company to move the family's household goods from Texas to South\r\n  Carolina and store the goods in South Carolina.Â  \r\nIn November, Wife visited her\r\n  foster parents in Pennsylvania for Thanksgiving and returned to Greenville\r\n  after the holiday.Â  During this period, Husband and Wife looked for more\r\n  permanent housing.Â  The couple looked at a house for rent in Cowpens, South\r\n  Carolina, and also looked at a house for sale in Greer, South Carolina. \r\nShortly thereafter, a dispute\r\n  arose between Husband and Wife over money and whether they were able to afford\r\n  the Greer house.Â  Wife began hitting and slapping Husband.Â  Husband left the\r\n  hotel and Wife followed.Â  As Husband attempted to leave the parking lot in his\r\n  car, Wife used her car to push Husband's car approximately six feet onto the\r\n  curb to prevent him from leaving.Â  Wife exited her vehicle and began tossing\r\n  items from Husband's trunk.Â  Afterwards, Husband and Wife talked for\r\n  approximately thirty minutes before Wife began hitting Husband.Â  Husband attempted\r\n  to leave a second time; however, Wife jumped onto the hood of his car and forcibly\r\n  removed a windshield wiper blade which she used to strike Husband several\r\n  times.Â  Thereafter, Husband requested the hotel's front desk staff call the\r\n  police.Â  Wife was arrested, and Husband bailed Wife out of jail the next\r\n  morning.\r\nHusband and Wife attempted to\r\n  reconcile, and the family went bowling on New Year's Eve 2007.Â  Upon returning\r\n  home, Husband and Wife became involved in an argument in front of Child.Â  Wife\r\n  attempted to hit Husband's head against the wall.Â  Husband explained Wife did\r\n  not attempt to &quot;physically damage&quot; his head, but was &quot;very, very\r\n  physical â€“ demonstrative of making a point.&quot;Â  The argument dissipated, and\r\n  although Husband considered leaving Wife, he remained in the home because of\r\n  Child. However, shortly thereafter another argument occurred and Husband left\r\n  the home. Â Â \r\nHusband initiated this action\r\n  for divorce on grounds of physical cruelty on January 17, 2008.Â  Wife was\r\n  served in Greenville on January 28, 2008.Â  However, Wife failed to answer and\r\n  thereafter the family court waived mediation because Wife's whereabouts were\r\n  unknown and she was in default.Â  Wife failed to appear at the preliminary\r\n  hearing held on February 28, 2008.Â  The family court found jurisdiction in\r\n  South Carolina was proper because Husband and Wife resided in South Carolina\r\n  more than three months prior to Husband's filing of this action, which\r\n  satisfied the requirements of section 20-3-30 of the South Carolina CodeÂ  (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  The family court awarded Wife temporary custody of Child with\r\n  visitation, and ordered Husband to pay Wife $1,700 per month in unallocated\r\n  family support.Â  Husband was also ordered to pay rent for Wife on a house in\r\n  Simpsonville, South Carolina, make Wife's car payment, and maintain insurance\r\n  for Wife and Child.\r\nPrior to the final hearing,\r\n  Wife moved to dismiss the action arguing the family court lacked jurisdiction\r\n  to adjudicate the divorce because she was a resident of Texas at the time she\r\n  was served.Â  After hearing evidence on the issue, the family court denied\r\n  Wife's motion to dismiss, finding it had personal jurisdiction and subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the divorce.Â  The family court's final order\r\n  granted Husband a divorce on the grounds of physical cruelty, awarded Wife\r\n  custody of Child, allowed Husband two weeks visitation per year, ordered\r\n  Husband to pay $4,000 per month in child support, and equitably divided the\r\n  parties' marital property.Â  No alimony was awarded.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In appeals from the\r\n  family court, this Court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.&quot; Â Simmons\r\n    v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 391-92,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011).Â  However, we recognize that the family court is in a\r\n  superior position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight\r\n  of the evidence.Â  See id. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655.Â  The\r\n  appellant has the burden to demonstrate the family court's findings are against\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in finding it had personal jurisdiction over her.Â  Wife maintains her appearance\r\n  at the final hearing constituted a limited appearance to contest jurisdiction.Â \r\n  Wife also argues the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\n  adjudicate the divorce because both she and Husband never intended to reside in\r\n  South Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine actions for divorce.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(2) (2010).Â  Before the family court can exercise subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction over a marriage and grant a divorce, the plaintiff or\r\n  defendant must have been a domiciliary of South Carolina.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-30 (Supp. 2010).Â  Section 20-3-30 provides:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    order to institute an action for divorce from the bonds of matrimony the\r\n    plaintiff must have resided in this State at least one year prior to the\r\n    commencement of the action or, if the plaintiff is a nonresident, the defendant\r\n    must have so resided in this State for this period; provided, that when both\r\n    parties are residents of the State when the action is commenced, the plaintiff\r\n    must have resided in this State only three months prior to commencement of the\r\n    action. . . .\r\n\r\nThe term &quot;reside&quot;\r\n  as used in this section is &quot;equivalent in substance to 'domicile.'&quot;Â  Gasque\r\n    v. Gasque, 246 S.C. 423, 426, 143 S.E.2d 811, 812&nbsp;(1965).Â  Domicile\r\n  &quot;means the place where a person has his true, fixed and permanent home and\r\n  principal establishment, to which he has, whenever he is absent, an intention\r\n  of returning.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The true basis and foundation of\r\n  domicile is the intention, the quo animo, of residence.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nInitially, Wife was\r\n  personally served with the summons and complaint in this action in Greenville,\r\n  South Carolina.Â  Accordingly, the family court properly determined it had personal\r\n  jurisdiction over Wife. Â See Whaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362\r\n  S.C. 456, 474, 609 S.E.2d 286, 295&nbsp;(2005) (&quot;Proper service of process\r\n  on a defendant . . . confers personal jurisdiction over the defendant.&quot;).Â \r\n  Therefore, the issue before us is whether Husband and Wife intended to reside\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHere, Husband secured\r\n  employment at Fluor Corporation in Greenville.Â  Husband explained he and Wife agreed\r\n  that he would move to Greenville first and then Wife and Child would move\r\n  shortly thereafter.Â  However, the night before Husband was to leave, Wife\r\n  decided Husband should bring Child and Child's homeschool materials to South\r\n  Carolina with him.Â  Upon arriving in Greenville, Husband and Child moved into\r\n  an extended stay hotel provided by Fluor.Â  Husband's parents came to Greenville\r\n  to help homeschool Child.Â  Wife was unhappy with Husband's parents assisting\r\n  with Child's homeschooling and moved into the extended stay hotel with Husband\r\n  and Child in early October 2007.\r\nLater that month, Wife,\r\n  Husband, and Child returned to Texas to pack the family's household goods and\r\n  move them to South Carolina.Â  Fluor provided a moving company to move the\r\n  family's household goods from Texas to South Carolina.Â  The moving company\r\n  placed the family's household goods into storage in South Carolina until\r\n  Husband and Wife secured more permanent housing.Â  Husband and Wife searched for\r\n  more permanent housing in Cowpens and Greer, South Carolina.\r\nBased on the foregoing, and\r\n  especially considering Wife sent Child with Husband to South Carolina, moved\r\n  all her household goods to South Carolina, and proceeded to look for permanent\r\n  housing in South Carolina, we conclude Husband and Wife moved to South Carolina\r\n  with the intention of making it their home.Â  In making this determination, we\r\n  are mindful that the family court specifically found Husband's testimony on\r\n  this issue was credible.Â  Accordingly, we believe the family court properly\r\n  determined it had subject matter jurisdiction over the parties' marriage.\r\nII.&nbsp; Appointment of Counsel\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in proceeding with trial when she had no attorney, could not afford an\r\n  attorney, and requested an attorney.Â  We disagree. \r\nGenerally, a litigant has a statutory\r\n  right to proceed pro se in South Carolina. See S.C Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-80\r\n  (2011).Â  A separation proceeding in family court does not involve the\r\n  deprivation of a liberty interest that mandates a state or federal due process\r\n  right to an attorney.Â  Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419\r\n  S.E.2d 779, 780&nbsp;(1992).Â  \r\nHere, at the beginning of\r\n  trial, the family court questioned Wife about her self-representation.Â  Wife\r\n  responded, indicating she felt competent to represent herself, understood the\r\n  nature of the proceedings, and could not afford to pay $5,000 for an attorney.Â \r\n  After questioning Wife, the court proceeded with Wife's motion to dismiss for\r\n  lack of jurisdiction.Â  During trial, Wife cross-examined Husband, presented\r\n  evidence, and testified on her own behalf.Â  However, at several points during\r\n  trial Wife requested a court-appointed attorney.Â  Although the court inquired\r\n  whether Wife requested a court-appointed attorney before the day of the final\r\n  hearing, the court did not appoint an attorney.Â  \r\nThe family court had no\r\n  obligation to appoint Wife an attorney in a divorce proceeding where she chose\r\n  to represent herself at the outset.Â  See id. at 551, 419 S.E.2d\r\n  at 780 (&quot;A separation proceeding, where one or both of the parties has\r\n  invoked the State's assistance in determining marital equities, simply does not\r\n  involve a deprivation that mandates a due process right to an attorney.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we see no error in the family court's decision to continue with\r\n  trial after Wife requested a court-appointed attorney.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIII. Alimony\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in summarily refusing to consider the issue of alimony in response to her\r\n  oral request at the final hearing.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 20-3-120 of the South Carolina Code (1985)\r\n  provides &quot;[i]n every divorce action from the bonds of matrimony either\r\n  party may in his or her complaint or answer or by petition pray for the\r\n  allowance to him or her of alimony and suit money and for the allowance of such\r\n  alimony and suit money pendente lite.&quot;Â  Generally, the\r\n  family court cannot award alimony unless a plaintiff or defendant participating\r\n  in a domestic relations action requests it in the complaint or answer.Â  See Bass v. Bass, 272 S.C. 177, 180, 249 S.E.2d 905, 906&nbsp;(1978)\r\n  (&quot;While it is true that pleadings in the family court must be liberally\r\n  construed, this rule cannot\r\n  be stretched so as to permit the judge to award relief not contemplated by the\r\n  pleadings. Due process requires that a litigant be placed on notice of the\r\n  issues which the court is to consider.&quot;) (footnote omitted). \r\nConversely, when a defendant\r\n  fails to answer, the South Carolina Rules of Family Court are unclear.Â  On the\r\n  one hand, Rule 2, SCRFC, specifies that Rule 55 of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure is not applicable in family court.Â  See Rule 2(a), SCRFC\r\n  (&quot;The following SCRCP, however, shall be inapplicable:Â  . . . 55 . . .\r\n  .&quot;).Â  However, Rule 17(b), SCRFC, suggests that at some point, Rule 55,\r\n  SCRCP, is incorporated into the final order.Â  See Rule 17(b), SCRFC\r\n  (&quot;In domestic relations matters, the provisions of Rule 55, SCRCP,\r\n  regarding orders of default shall be made in the final order issued by the\r\n  family court.&quot;).Â  \r\nThis discrepancy has caused\r\n  uncertainty in the bar as to handling the issue of default in family court.Â  If\r\n  Rule 55, SCRCP, is not applicable, then there is no need for our family court\r\n  judges and family court practitioners to deal with unnecessary default\r\n  proceedings and paperwork.Â  If Rule 55, SCRCP, is applicable, then perhaps Rule\r\n  2, SCRFC, should be amended to clarify such application and to eliminate any\r\n  potential conflict.Â  Family court practitioners and judges need guidance on how\r\n  to proceed when default is involved; however, any amendment to the rules must\r\n  come from the supreme court.Â  Â Â \r\nNotwithstanding, Stamey v.\r\n  Stamey is instructive regarding the issue on appeal. Â See 289 S.C.\r\n  507, 347 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  There, although wife was in default prior\r\n  to the final hearing, the family court ruled on the issues of alimony, support,\r\n  and counsel fees.Â  Id. at 511, 347 S.E.2d at 114-15.Â  Husband appealed.Â \r\n  Relying on a prior version of the family court rules which stated &quot;[e]ven\r\n  though the respondent does not file an answer, he may, with permission of the\r\n  court, be heard on issues of custody of children, alimony, support and counsel\r\n  fees,&quot; this court found wife's default was immaterial because the family\r\n  court rules allowed those issues to be raised at the final hearing by a\r\n  defendant who did not answer.Â  Id.\r\nTurning to the instant case,\r\n  Rule 17(a), SCRFC, vests the family court with discretion to determine whether\r\n  to allow a non-answering defendant to raise the issue of alimony.Â  Here, Wife\r\n  requested alimony at the conclusion of the merits hearing; however, the family\r\n  court denied her request based upon her failure to answer: &quot;Alimony is not\r\n  before me. There's been no pleading filed by [Wife] for alimony.Â  That issue is\r\n  not before me.&quot;Â  In the subsequent colloquy with Husband's counsel, the\r\n  court focused on the facts that Wife failed to answer and that Husband's\r\n  counsel filed an affidavit of default.Â  The record lacks any indication the\r\n  family court considered whether Wife should be allowed to raise the issue of alimony\r\n  despite her failure to answer; therefore, we conclude the family court erred in\r\n  failing to exercise its discretion.Â  See Fontaine v. Peitz, 291\r\n  S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566&nbsp;(1987) (&quot;When the trial judge is\r\n  vested with discretion, but his ruling reveals no discretion was, in fact,\r\n  exercised, an error of law has occurred.&quot;).Â  Although we note the\r\n  discrepancy regarding the application of Rule 55, SCRCP, in family court, the\r\n  result herein would not change because of our application of Rule 17(a), SCRFC.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we remand the issue of alimony to the family court with the\r\n  authority to exercise the same discretion it had at the time of the final\r\n  hearing.Â  See Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 627, 620 S.E.2d 59,\r\n  64&nbsp;(2005) (citing Fontaine and finding the family court's failure\r\n  to exercise its discretion to determine whether the testimony of three of\r\n  wife's witnesses should be excluded because she failed to supplement her\r\n  interrogatory answers in a timely fashion required a new hearing).Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Mandatory Mediation\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in exempting this action from mandatory mediation.Â  Specifically, Wife\r\n  maintains the family court was not informed of correspondence between Husband's\r\n  counsel and Wife's Texas counsel &quot;around the same time&quot; he filed the\r\n  request to exempt this case from mediation.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Greenville County, civil\r\n  suits and domestic relations actions are subject to a mandatory alternative\r\n  dispute resolution process.Â  RE: Circuit Court Arbitration &amp; Mediation &amp;\r\n    Family Court Mediation, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated June 21, 2006.Â  South\r\n  Carolina Rule of Alternative Dispute Resolution 3(a) provides:\r\n\r\n  All\r\n    civil actions filed in the circuit court, all cases in which a Notice of Intent\r\n    to File Suit is filed pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code Â§ 15-79-125(A),\r\n    and all contested issues in domestic relations actions filed in family court,\r\n    except for cases set forth in Rule 3(b) or (c), are subject to court-ordered\r\n    mediation under these rules unless the parties agree to conduct an arbitration.\r\n\r\nHowever, a party can request\r\n  a case be exempted from mandatory mediation for &quot;case specific\r\n  reasons.&quot;Â  Rule 5(e), SCRADR.Â  The chief administrative judge is vested\r\n  with the discretion to grant a motion to exempt for good cause.Â  Id.\r\nHere, the chief\r\n  administrative judge for the Greenville County Family Court exempted this case\r\n  from mandatory mediation because Wife was in default and her whereabouts were\r\n  unknown.Â  We find Wife's default and unknown whereabouts constituted good cause\r\n  for exempting this action from mandatory mediation.Â  Furthermore, Wife offers\r\n  no support in the record for her suggestion Husband's counsel knew of her\r\n  whereabouts at the time he requested the case be exempted from mediation.Â  In\r\n  fact, Husband's counsel represented the communication with Wife's Texas counsel\r\n  occurred after he requested the exemption.Â  Accordingly, we find the family\r\n  court properly exempted this case from mediation.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we affirm the family\r\n  court's decision regarding (1) subject matter jurisdiction, (2) appointment of\r\n  counsel, and (3) exemption from mandatory mediation.Â  However, we reverse the\r\n  trial court's decision regarding alimony and remand the alimony issue to the\r\n  family court to exercise all the discretion it had at the time of the final\r\n  hearing.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, J.,\r\n  concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wife did not work outside the home during the parties'\r\n  marriage.\r\n[2] The pool slide, approximately ten feet tall, had to be\r\n  unbolted from its footing.Â  The pool heater is approximately six feet by eight\r\n  feet and four feet tall.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4907","title":"Newton v.

Achurch, III, &nbsp;Jason  Franklin Ward, and Mary Bass Lohr, all of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â After\r\n  the Zoning Board of Appeals for Beaufort County (Board) issued a special use\r\n  permit for additional construction on the site of an existing convenience\r\n  center[1] (the DOC) on Daufuskie Island, Donald Newton and Jean\r\n  Flagg-Newton (collectively the Newtons) appealed the Board's decision to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  The matter was referred to a master-in-equity, who affirmed the\r\n  Board's decision.Â  The Newtons appeal, arguing the master erred in affirming\r\n  the Board's decision not to require a Community Impact Statement (CIS).[2]Â \r\n  They contend the master erred in finding:Â  (1) a CIS was not required; (2) the\r\n  Beaufort County (County) ordinance governing convenience centers (section\r\n  106-1362) does not apply to uses within the Daufuskie Community Preservation District;\r\n  (3) the Board knew the impact of the existing DOC and, therefore, did not need\r\n  to consider a CIS; and (4) section&nbsp;106-552 of the Beaufort County Code of\r\n  Ordinances (Code) controlled the consideration for approval of the special use\r\n  permit in this case.Â  We affirm and modify the master's decision as discussed\r\n  below.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2009, a contractor acting on behalf of Beaufort County applied to the Board for a special use permit\r\n  to perform additional construction on the site of the DOC, which is located\r\n  within the Daufuskie Island Community Preservation District.Â  The County\r\n  proposed to bring the DOC into greater compliance with County requirements by\r\n  installing a fence, a swale for stormwater runoff, and three trash compactors,\r\n  thereby reducing the cost of hauling away the collected trash and making the\r\n  site safer and cleaner.Â  \r\nOn December 10, 2009, the Board held a public hearing at which the Newtons and others spoke.Â  According\r\n  to the County, the improvements required a special use permit because the DOC predated the County's zoning ordinances and did not conform to them.Â  The Newtons opposed the\r\n  issuance of a special use permit, arguing such a permit would constitute\r\n  &quot;spot-zoning,&quot; did not comport with the County's comprehensive plan\r\n  for development, and would conflict with the development of adjacent\r\n  recreational property.Â  Moreover, the Newtons expressed concern that the\r\n  proposed construction would expand the DOC, making it a waste processing site\r\n  for housing developments that had been handling their own waste disposal.Â  In\r\n  response to the Newtons' concerns, David Coleman of the County's Building and\r\n  Engineering Department explained the proposed improvements would not expand the\r\n  DOC but instead would utilize previously cleared land to surround the DOC with\r\n  buffer zones as required by ordinance.Â  In addition, the installation of compactors\r\n  would enable the DOC to process the same amount of trash as before but would\r\n  reduce the need for hauling by fifty to sixty percent.Â  According to Coleman, an\r\n  existing restriction against commercial dumping at the DOC would continue to\r\n  prevent the dumping of waste collected within the island's housing\r\n  developments.Â  \r\nThe Board unanimously\r\n  approved the request for a special use permit.Â  On January 28, 2010, it issued\r\n  the permit, subject to certain conditions, in accordance with &quot;Article\r\n  III, Subdivision IV, Special Uses, Section 106-554, of the Zoning and\r\n  Development Standards Ordinance.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, the Newtons appealed the Board's decision to the circuit\r\n  court.Â Â Â  \r\nOn May 19, 2010, the master heard\r\n  arguments on the issues briefed by the parties.Â  A month later, the master\r\n  issued an order &quot;deny[ing] the appeal,&quot; in which he effectively\r\n  affirmed the Board's decision.Â  Specifically, the master found the ordinance\r\n  governing convenience centers does not apply within Community Preservation\r\n  districts.Â  Rather, he determined the Board &quot;only needed to consider the\r\n  criteria for approval of a special use permit under [section] 106-552&quot; and\r\n  was not required to order a CIS because the impact of the existing DOC was\r\n  already known.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, appeal\r\n  from a final order of the circuit court following its review of the zoning\r\n  board's decision is to the court of appeals.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-850 (2004); Rule 203(d), SCACR.Â  Appellate courts regard\r\n  appeals from zoning decisions in the same manner as appeals from other circuit\r\n  court judgments in law cases.Â  Petersen v. City of Clemson, 312 S.C.\r\n  162, 169-70, 439 S.E.2d 317, 322 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Bishop v. Hightower,\r\n  292 S.C. 358, 360, 356 S.E.2d 420, 421 (Ct. App. 1987)).Â  Even if a court\r\n  disagrees with a zoning board's decision, the court will refrain from\r\n  substituting its judgment for that of the zoning board unless the decision\r\n  &quot;is arbitrary, capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful purpose,\r\n  or if the [zoning] board has abused its discretion.&quot;Â  Rest. Row Assocs.\r\n    v. Horry Cnty., 335 S.C. 209, 216, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446&nbsp;(1999).Â  &quot;An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's decision is unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or controlled by an error of law.&quot; Â Cnty. of Richland v.\r\n    Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Preservation\r\nAs a threshold issue, the\r\n  Board contends the Newtons' arguments on appeal are unpreserved because the\r\n  Newtons failed to raise these arguments to the Board during the administrative\r\n  process.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Board's argument\r\n  overlooks the issue identification requirements of the statute governing\r\n  appeals from decisions by zoning boards, as well as the non-adversarial nature\r\n  of administrative proceedings.Â  Appeal from a decision by a zoning board of appeals is to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-820 (Supp. 2010).Â  Any &quot;person\r\n  who may have a substantial interest in any decision&quot; by the Board may\r\n  initiate an appeal of that decision by filing with the circuit court a &quot;petition\r\n  in writing setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is\r\n  contrary to law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The circuit court may not take additional\r\n  evidence and &quot;must determine only whether the decision of the board is\r\n  correct as a matter of law.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\nThis procedure\r\n  does not allow for issue identification,[4] or even party identification, prior to the filing of a petition with the\r\n  circuit court.Â  The statute does not require the appellant to attend a public\r\n  hearing on the Board's decision or even to communicate his concerns to the\r\n  Board prior to filing his petition with the circuit court.Â  Thus, the sole\r\n  preservation requirement for a first-level appeal of a zoning board's decision\r\n  is that an appellant must set forth his issues on appeal in a written petition and\r\n  file that petition with the circuit court before the thirty-day filing period\r\n  expires.Â  Here, the Board rendered its decision on January 28, 2010.Â  The\r\n  Newtons filed their petition outlining the grounds for their appeal on February\r\n  26, 2010, which was within the thirty-day filing period.Â  The Board does not\r\n  contend that this petition failed to identify the grounds for appeal.Â \r\n  Therefore, the grounds for appeal identified in the Newtons' petition were\r\n  properly before the master.Â  \r\nII. Convenience\r\n  Center Ordinance (Section 106-1362)\r\nThe Newtons assert the master\r\n  erred in finding the requirements of the County ordinance governing convenience\r\n  centers (section 106-1362, Article V, Division 2) do not apply to uses in the\r\n  Daufuskie Community Preservation District.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe standards governing\r\n  limited and special uses in Article V, Division 2, cover uses &quot;designated\r\n  in the general land use table 106-1098. Â These standards are in addition to\r\n  other standards required elsewhere in this chapter, as well as building code\r\n  requirements, and further supersede certain standards in [A]rticle VI of this\r\n  chapter.&quot;Â  Beaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§ 106-1126 (Art. V, Div. 2, Subdiv.\r\n  I) (1999).Â  The ordinance governing convenience centers appears in Article V,\r\n  Division 2.Â  See Beaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§&nbsp;106-1362 (Art. V,\r\n  Div. 2, Subdiv. VIII) (2003) (describing limited and special use standards for\r\n  convenience centers in &quot;all applicable districts,&quot; including types of\r\n  waste accepted, buffer zones, lighting, and CIS requirement).\r\nThe general land use table in\r\n  section 106-1098 (the Table) details standards for eleven distinct types of\r\n  land use districts, each of which the Table classifies as either a Priority\r\n  area or a Rural area.Â  Beaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§ 106-1098 (Art. V, Div. 1) (2009).Â \r\n  The Table does not describe standards for Community Preservation districts, Transitional\r\n  Investment areas, or special districts.Â  Id.Â  A note following the Table\r\n  indicates Community Preservation standards are located in one of the appendices\r\n  to Chapter 106.[5]\r\nWe affirm the master's\r\n  determination that the standards described in the Table, and consequently the\r\n  provisions of section 106-1362, do not govern Community Preservation\r\n  districts.Â  Although the Newtons accurately assert the Code indicates in\r\n  several places the coverage of its provisions is layered, we find no indication\r\n  the coverage of Article V, Division 2, or of section 106-1362 specifically, extends\r\n  to Community Preservation districts.Â  As the master observed, section 106-1126\r\n  states that Article V, Division 2, applies to the land uses designated in the\r\n  Table.Â  However, no mention of Community Preservation standards appears within\r\n  the body of the Table.Â  Instead, a note appearing below the Table offers a\r\n  reference for where a reader may locate those standards.Â  Â§&nbsp;106-1098.Â  Because the Table itself does not include\r\n  the standards for Community Preservation districts, the master correctly\r\n  reasoned that section 106-1362 does not apply to Community Preservation\r\n  districts.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Known Impact\r\nNext, the Newtons assert the\r\n  master erred in finding that because a convenience center already existed on\r\n  the parcel at issue and the reviewing staff did not determine a CIS was\r\n  required, the center's impact was known and the Board did not need to consider\r\n  a CIS.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe division entitled\r\n  &quot;Discretionary Reviews&quot; authorizes the County's staff to determine\r\n  whether an applicant must submit a CIS as part of his application for a special\r\n  use permit.Â  Beaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§ 106-552 (Art. III, Div. 3, Subdiv.\r\n  IV) (2004).Â Â  The procedure for such a review requires that the DRT examine the\r\n  applicant's special use development plan and recommend whether the Board should\r\n  approve the permit.Â  Id.Â  The special use development plan must address\r\n  whether the proposed use is consistent with the &quot;purposes, goals,\r\n  objectives, and policies&quot; of the County's comprehensive development plan,\r\n  is compatible with the character of nearby land, and minimizes any adverse\r\n  effects.Â  Id.Â  The Board may require submission of a CIS or traffic\r\n  impact analysis if its staff determines those reports are needed.Â  Id.\r\nWe affirm the master's\r\n  determination that section 106-552 permitted the Board to use information\r\n  already in its possession to decide whether a CIS was necessary.Â  The Board had\r\n  to consider the impact of the improvements, not merely of the DOC itself.Â  The\r\n  prior existence of the DOC was less crucial to this determination than the\r\n  information about the proposed improvements that the reviewing staff had in\r\n  hand.Â  Section 106-552 required the County to submit with its permit\r\n  application a special use development plan addressing how the improvements to\r\n  the DOC would affect the character of nearby land and how the County intended\r\n  to minimize any adverse effects.Â  We find such a document,[6] as described in section 106-552, would provide the DRT and the Board with\r\n  information useful in determining the proposed improvements' compatibility with\r\n  the County's comprehensive development plan and projected impact on nearby\r\n  property.Â  In addition, the County's application materials suggest any adverse\r\n  effects of the proposed improvements on the area would be minimal.Â  According\r\n  to the application, the improvements would affect the manner of handling solid\r\n  waste at the existing site by providing a &quot;more efficient, cleaner\r\n  facility&quot; and would &quot;enhance the aesthetic quality of the\r\n  island.&quot;Â  Consequently, the DRT and the Board could decide, based upon the\r\n  information already in hand, whether to order a CIS.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the evidence in\r\n  the record does not support the Newtons' contention that the proposed improvements\r\n  would result in a &quot;more intensive use&quot; of the DOC.Â  The Newtons\r\n  appear particularly concerned that the Board lacked information that the DOC's\r\n  compaction capability would invite a greater volume of waste.Â  At the public\r\n  hearing, Coleman indicated the installation of trash compactors was intended to\r\n  reduce hauling costs.Â  Coleman stated the improvements were aimed at making the\r\n  DOC &quot;much safer, much cleaner, much more sanitary, and presentable.&quot;Â \r\n  Neither Coleman nor Bobby Lee of Thomas &amp; Hutton Engineering Company, who\r\n  also spoke, advised the Board that any proposed improvement was intended to\r\n  prepare the DOC to handle an increased volume of waste.Â  Moreover, no evidence\r\n  indicated the improved DOC would begin accepting additional types of waste or\r\n  waste from different sources.[7]Â \r\n  Thus, the Newtons' concerns are speculative.Â  In view of these facts, the\r\n  master did not err in finding section 106-552 did not require the Board to\r\n  order a CIS.Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Discretionary\r\n  Review under Section 106-552\r\nThe Newtons also assert the\r\n  master erred in finding that only section 106-552 controlled the Board's\r\n  consideration of the special use permit in this case because the preceding\r\n  section, which outlines the scope of the entire subdivision, invokes the Table\r\n  from section&nbsp;106-1098.Â  We disagree but modify the language of the master's\r\n  order as discussed below.Â  \r\nArticle III, Division 3,\r\n  Subdivision IV, governs the discretionary review of applications for special\r\n  use permits:Â  \r\n\r\n  Certain\r\n    land uses and developments present unique problems with respect to their\r\n    property location. Such land uses and developments are identified as special\r\n    uses in each particular zoning district (see table 106-1098). Analysis and\r\n    judgment of the consequences of each use and development is necessary to\r\n    preserve and promote the public health, safety, and welfare. \r\n\r\nBeaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§\r\n  106-551 (Art. III, Div. 3, Subdiv. IV) (1999).Â Â  \r\nTo the extent the Newtons\r\n  argue section 106-551 invoked the Table, and therefore section 106-1362, this\r\n  issue is unpreserved.[8]Â \r\n  The Newtons did not identify this argument as a ground for their appeal of the\r\n  Board's decision.Â  See Â§ 6-29-820 (requiring appeal from the\r\n  Board's decision to be in the form of a &quot;petition in writing setting forth\r\n  plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is contrary to law&quot;).Â  In\r\n  addition, the record does not reflect that they sought a ruling on it from the master.Â  See First\r\n    Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 568, 511 S.E.2d 372, 379\r\n  (Ct. App. 1998) (holding an issue is unpreserved for appellate review even if\r\n  it was raised to the master, if he did not rule upon it and appellant failed to\r\n  seek a ruling through a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  any connection between section 106-551 and the Table or section 106-1362 is not\r\n  properly before this court.Â  \r\nTo the extent the Newtons\r\n  challenge the master's finding the Board &quot;only needed to consider the\r\n  criteria for approval of a special use permit under [section] 106-552,&quot; we\r\n  affirm the master's decision but modify the language of the order.Â  In his\r\n  order, the master examined the Newtons' arguments concerning Article V,\r\n  Division 2, and determined they did not apply to the situation at hand.Â \r\n  Specifically, he found both the Table and section 106-1362 were inapplicable.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, the master recognized that Community Preservation districts\r\n  &quot;are governed by specific standards which are outlined in Appendix\r\n  D.&quot;Â  Although he did not examine Appendix D's provisions,[9] the master clearly was aware the standards enunciated in Appendix D applied to\r\n  Community Preservation Districts.Â  The master's statement that the Board &quot;only\r\n  needed to consider the criteria for approval of a special use permit under\r\n  [section] 106-552&quot; is incongruous with his finding concerning Appendix D.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the master's decision to the extent he found the Board\r\n  needed to consider the criteria for approval of a special use permit under Â§106-552,\r\n  and not the provisions of Article V, Division 2.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Failure to Require\r\n  a CIS (Section 106-9(b)(2) and (3))\r\nThe Newtons assert the master\r\n  erred in finding the Board did not abuse its discretion by not requiring a CIS\r\n  before it issued a permit for the construction of a convenience center on\r\n  Daufuskie Island.Â  In support, they argue because the Board did not have the\r\n  studies and assessments required by section\r\n  106-9(b)(2) of the Beaufort County Code of Ordinances, it &quot;lacked the\r\n  legal evidence to support its decision.&quot;Â \r\n  We decline to reach this argument because\r\n  it is unpreserved for this court's review.Â  Although the Newtons raised it to\r\n  the master, he did not rule on it in his final order, and the record does not\r\n  reflect that the Newtons moved the master to alter or amend the judgment.Â  See Soden, 333 S.C. at 568, 511 S.E.2d at 379 (holding an issue is\r\n  unpreserved for appellate review if it was raised to the master but he did not\r\n  rule upon it and the appellant failed to seek a ruling through a motion\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP).[10]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the statute governing appeal from a decision by a\r\n  zoning board of appeals did not require the Newtons\r\n  to raise their issues on appeal to the Board in order to preserve them for\r\n  review by the master.Â  However, we find the Newtons failed to seek a ruling\r\n  from the master on the issue of whether section 106-9(b) required submission of\r\n  a CIS for our review.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  \r\nFor the reasons discussed\r\n  above, we affirm the master's decisions that the standards described in the Table do not govern Community\r\n  Preservation districts and that section 106-552 did not require the Board to\r\n  order a CIS.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find the\r\n  master's statement that the Board &quot;only needed to consider the criteria\r\n  for approval of a special use permit under [section] 106-552&quot; apparently\r\n  conflicts with his recognition that the standards contained in Appendix D to\r\n  the Code applied to Community Preservation districts such as the one on\r\n  Daufuskie Island.Â  Consequently, we affirm the master's finding that the Board\r\n  properly considered the criteria for approval of a special use permit, but we modify\r\n  his order to hold the Board needed to consider the criteria for approval of a\r\n  special use permit under Â§106-552, and not the provisions of Article V,\r\n  Division 2.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A &quot;convenience center&quot; is any location authorized by the County as a\r\n  collection point for residential solid waste.Â  Beaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§&nbsp;62-3\r\n  (Art. I) (1982).Â  \r\n[2] A CIS is a report assessing the proposed change's impact on the area, the\r\n  environment, traffic, and archaeological sites.Â  Beaufort Cnty. Code of Ord. Â§&nbsp;106-367(g)(1)\r\n  (Art. III, Div. 2, Subdiv. II) (2004).Â  &quot;The purpose of the CIS is to (i)\r\n  determine if alternatives would avoid the adverse impacts, (ii) determine that\r\n  the plan selected minimizes the impact, and (iii) identify mitigation measures\r\n  that would offset the impacts.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n[3] Section 106-554 of the Code (1999) allows the Board to amend, extend, vary, or\r\n  alter an existing special use permit &quot;only pursuant to the standards and\r\n  procedures for the approval of the original use.&quot;Â  \r\n[4] See Austin v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 362 S.C. 29, 37-38, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 209, 213-14 (Ct. App. 2004) (describing differences between adversarial\r\n  trial proceedings and administrative proceedings in which circuit court acts in\r\n  appellate capacity and finding statutory scheme does not permit amendment of\r\n  grounds for appeal after thirty-day filing period expires).\r\n[5] The note refers to Appendix E, which appears to be a scrivener's error.Â \r\n  Appendix D contains Community Preservation standards, while Appendix E lists\r\n  trees and plants recommended for use in landscaping.Â  Furthermore, while\r\n  Appendix D applied to the Daufuskie Community Preservation District at the time\r\n  of the Board's and master's decisions, its applicability ceased in February\r\n  2011.Â  Standards for Daufuskie Island now appear in the Daufuskie Island Code\r\n  (Chapter 106, Appendix S, of the Code).Â  \r\n[6] Neither the record nor the parties' arguments on appeal reflect a challenge to\r\n  the completeness of the application as it relates to compliance with section\r\n  106-552.Â  In particular, we note the Newtons never raised the issue of whether\r\n  the County's application included a special use development plan.Â  \r\n[7] We note the DOC predates the implementation of Appendix D, and Coleman informed\r\n  the Board the DOC was restricted from accepting commercially collected waste.Â \r\n  He further stated that restriction would remain in effect.Â  \r\n[8] It is also a less compelling rehash of their similar argument under section\r\n  106-1126, discussed in Section II, above.\r\n[9] The record does not reflect that the Newtons presented any arguments under\r\n  Appendix D to the master, nor did they advance an argument under Appendix D to\r\n  this court prior to submission of their Reply Brief.Â  \r\n[10] At oral argument, the Newtons pointed this court to the decision of the Board,\r\n  which they claim required a CIS to be developed after the Board made its\r\n  decision.Â  We do not read the order in that fashion.Â  Section 106-57 of the\r\n  Code, (Art. II, Div. 1) (2004), sets forth the responsibilities of the Board\r\n  vis-Ã -vis the DRT and states for grants of special use permits, the Board makes\r\n  the final decision and the DRT only makes recommendations to the Board.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4908","title":"Brunson v.

Turner, both of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In this workers' compensation appeal, Sharon Brunson\r\n  (Brunson) appeals the circuit court's order affirming the Appellate Panel of\r\n  the Workers' Compensation Commission's (Appellate Panel) determination that Brunson\r\n  did not suffer a compensable work-related injury.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBrunson began working for her\r\n  employer, American Koyo Bearings (Koyo), in March 1999 and claimed she began\r\n  experiencing skin and respiratory problems in September 2001.Â  Brunson filed a\r\n  workers' compensation claim against Koyo on April 16, 2002. Â Brunson alleged\r\n  she sustained injuries to her lungs, skin, throat, voice box, and nasal\r\n  passages as a result of exposure to certain chemicals and petroleum products\r\n  while working on an assembly line at one of Koyo's manufacturing plants.Â  As a\r\n  result of this exposure, Brunson claimed she suffered from contact dermatitis, asthma,\r\n  and vocal problems.Â  In her Form 50, Brunson requested a finding on\r\n  compensability, additional medical treatment, and payment of permanent and\r\n  total disability benefits. Â In response, Koyo admitted Brunson suffered\r\n  from contact dermatitis but denied she suffered any permanent impairment to\r\n  other body parts and maintained she was not entitled to temporary total\r\n  disability benefits. \r\nAfter reporting her symptoms,\r\n  Koyo referred her to one of its treating physicians, Dr. W. H. Whitley, who\r\n  prescribed Brunson two topical ointments for her contact dermatitis and\r\n  Darvocet for her pain.Â  Dr. Whitley advised Brunson to wear gloves to avoid\r\n  contact with the petroleum products and chemicals used by Koyo in its\r\n  manufacturing process.Â  While Dr. Whitley concluded the contact dermatitis was\r\n  caused by exposure to chemicals, he did not believe Brunson's symptoms of chest\r\n  congestion, hoarseness, and shortness of breath resulted from inhaling\r\n  chemicals at Koyo.Â  Dr. Whitley believed Brunson had &quot;secondary gain\r\n  objectives&quot; and while contact dermatitis was a common problem at Koyo, Brunson\r\n  was the only employee who had been sent to him complaining of chest congestion\r\n  and hoarseness.Â  \r\nSoon thereafter, Brunson\r\n  sought an independent evaluation from Dr. Douglas Markham, an allergy and\r\n  asthma specialist.Â  Dr. Markham diagnosed Brunson as having rhinitis and\r\n  post-nasal drainage.Â  In Dr. Markham's medical report, he concluded Brunson's\r\n  health problems were related to her chemical exposure at Koyo based in part on\r\n  the medical history she gave him, specifically her statement that she improved\r\n  when she was out of work.Â  Dr. Markham referred Brunson to Dr. Richard\r\n  Sterling, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, for an evaluation.Â  Dr. Sterling\r\n  found no congenital basis or physical abnormalities for Brunson's ailments and\r\n  did not treat Brunson for any problems related to her ear, nose, or throat.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing on\r\n  October 8, 2002, the single commissioner issued an order dated January 29,\r\n  2003, finding Brunson had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that she\r\n  sustained compensable injuries to her lungs, nasal passage, vocal cords, and\r\n  skin.Â  The single commissioner awarded Brunson medical benefits and payment of\r\n  temporary total disability benefits.Â  Koyo appealed the single commissioner's\r\n  order but did not challenge the compensability of the contact dermatitis.Â  Upon\r\n  review, the Appellate Panel vacated the single commissioner's order and\r\n  remanded the case for a de novo hearing.Â  Brunson appealed to the circuit\r\n  court, which found her appeal was interlocutory because a substantial right had\r\n  not been violated.Â  The circuit court dismissed Brunson's appeal, whereupon she\r\n  appealed to this court. This court agreed with the circuit court, dismissed\r\n  Brunson's appeal, and remanded her case to the single commissioner.[1]Â  \r\nOn February 7, 2007, the\r\n  single commissioner conducted a de novo hearing on Brunson's claims.Â  In her\r\n  order, the commissioner found Brunson failed to establish she suffered a\r\n  compensable work-related injury or a compensable occupational disease.Â  To\r\n  support her finding, the commissioner stated she did not find Brunson's\r\n  testimony to be credible.Â  Specifically, she found Brunson to be\r\n  &quot;extremely evasive on cross examination as to previous respiratory\r\n  problems, answering most questions with the response that she could not\r\n  'remember' or that she could not 'recall.'&quot;Â  When Brunson was asked\r\n  whether she had been exposed to chemicals in her previous employment at a wood\r\n  laminate plant, Brunson stated that despite working for her prior employer for\r\n  eight years, she could not recall whether she had been exposed to chemicals.Â \r\n  The single commissioner noted Brunson had a family history of asthma and sinus\r\n  problems and that she had been treated for respiratory problems prior to her\r\n  employment with Koyo. Â \r\nIn reaching her decision, the\r\n  single commissioner noted the testimony from several co-workers in her order.Â \r\n  The witnesses testified on Brunson's behalf at the original hearing, and while\r\n  two of the four witnesses did not testify at the de novo hearing, the parties\r\n  stipulated their testimony from the prior hearing would be substantially the\r\n  same.Â  All of Brunson's witnesses testified they noticed Brunson had a rash on\r\n  her skin and had hoarseness and apparent breathing problems while working.Â  After\r\n  reviewing their testimony, the single commissioner found their testimony was\r\n  not persuasive because each admitted they were friends with Brunson outside of\r\n  work. \r\nBased on medical evidence and\r\n  other testimony adduced at the original and de novo hearing, the single\r\n  commissioner concluded any respiratory problems were not causally related to\r\n  her employment with Koyo. Â Furthermore, while Brunson's contact dermatitis was\r\n  compensable through the date of the February 2007 hearing, the single commissioner\r\n  concluded she failed to establish she developed a compensable work-related injury\r\n  or occupational disease as a result of her employment.Â  Brunson appealed to the\r\n  Appellate Panel, which affirmed the single commissioner.Â  The circuit court\r\n  affirmed the Appellate Panel, and this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures\r\n  Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of workers' compensation\r\n  decisions.Â  Pierre v. Seaside Farms, Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 540, 689\r\n  S.E.2d 615, 618 (2010).Â  Under the APA, this court can reverse or modify the\r\n  decision of the Commission when the substantial rights of the appellant have\r\n  been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n  considering the record as a whole.Â  Transp. Ins. Co. &amp; Flagstar Corp. v.\r\n    S.C. Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 427, 699 S.E.2d 687, 689-90 (2010). \r\nWhen\r\n  the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate\r\n  Panel are conclusive.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 290,\r\n  599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In workers' compensation cases, the\r\n  Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact. Â Shealy v. Aiken Cnty.,\r\n  341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  &quot;The final determination\r\n  of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to\r\n  the Appellate Panel.&quot; Â Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 528,\r\n  593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrunson claims the circuit\r\n  court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's finding that Brunson's injuries\r\n  to her lungs, bronchi, and nasal passages were not sustained during the course\r\n  and scope of her employment.Â  Specifically, Brunson asserts substantial\r\n  evidence was presented in the form of expert medical testimony, medical\r\n  evidence, and lay testimony to support the compensability of her claim.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;The South Carolina\r\n  Workers' Compensation Act requires that, to be compensable, an injury by\r\n  accident must be one 'arising out of and in the course of employment.'&quot; Â Osteen\r\n    v. Greenville Cnty. Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 49, 508 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1998); see\r\n      also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;[A]ll occupational\r\n  diseases are treated as 'injuries by accident.'&quot;Â  State Workers' Comp.\r\n    Fund v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 313 S.C. 536, 538, 443 S.E.2d 546, 548\r\n  (1994).Â  An occupational disease is one which develops over a period of time as\r\n  opposed to an injury that is attributable to a one-time event.Â  See State\r\n    Workers' Comp. Fund v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 310 S.C. 187, 189, 426\r\n  S.E.2d 112, 113 (Ct. App. 1992), rev'd on other grounds by State\r\n    Workers' Comp. Fund v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 313 S.C. 536, 443 S.E.2d\r\n  546 (1994).Â  Because Brunson claimed she developed respiratory problems as a\r\n  result of continued exposure to chemicals at Koyo, she was required to\r\n  establish the following six elements to recover benefits:\r\n\r\n   (1) A disease; (2) the disease must arise out of and in the course of the claimant's\r\n    employment; (3) the disease must be due to hazards in excess of those hazards\r\n    that are ordinarily incident to employment; (4) the disease must be peculiar to\r\n    the occupation in which the claimant was engaged; (5) the hazard causing the\r\n    disease must be one recognized as peculiar to a particular trade, process,\r\n    occupation, or employment; and (6) the disease must directly result from\r\n    the claimant's continuous exposure to the normal working conditions of the\r\n    particular trade, process, occupation, or employment.\r\n\r\nMuir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 283, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591-92 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court found\r\n  Brunson did not suffer a work-related injury to her lungs, bronchi, and nasal\r\n  passages.Â  In making this conclusion, the circuit court held that Brunson did\r\n  not establish her asthma or the chemicals causing her asthma were peculiar to\r\n  her occupation. Â Furthermore, the circuit court found Brunson did not prove her\r\n  asthma was a direct result of her exposure to normal working conditions at\r\n  Koyo.Â  \r\nDespite the circuit court's\r\n  conclusion, Brunson contends she presented credible medical testimony to prove\r\n  she suffered a compensable work-related injury.Â  Brunson highlights Dr.\r\n  Markham's medical reports and material data safety sheets that linked her asthma\r\n  to her employment with Koyo; however, other competent evidence and testimony\r\n  was presented to the contrary.Â  See Ballenger v. S. Worsted Corp.,\r\n  209 S.C. 463, 467, 40 S.E.2d 681, 682-83 (1946) (finding that while medical\r\n  testimony is entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if\r\n  there is other competent evidence in the record). Â Dr. Markham explicitly based\r\n  his opinion on Brunson's statements that she improved while out of work and\r\n  that she had no prior history of asthma or breathing problems. Â However, Brunson's\r\n  claim that she never suffered from respiratory issues was directly refuted by\r\n  medical records documenting her respiratory complaints prior to her employment\r\n  with Koyo.Â  Although Dr. Markham reasonably relied on Brunson's statements in\r\n  forming his opinion on the source of her asthma, we find his opinion is not conclusive,\r\n  particularly when the single commissioner found Brunson was not credible and\r\n  evaded questions regarding prior respiratory issues and corresponding treatment\r\n  throughout her testimony.Â  \r\nMoreover, Dr. Whitley stated\r\n  in his medical report that while the contact dermatitis was a common problem at\r\n  Koyo, Brunson is the only patient he treated who complained of chest congestion\r\n  and hoarseness from inhaling chemical fumes at Koyo. Â Unlike Dr.\r\n  Markham, Dr. Whitley believed she had ulterior motives in pursuing her disability\r\n  claim against Koyo and stated her health issues were strictly limited to\r\n  &quot;simple contact dermatitis.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  When conflicting medical evidence is presented, this court must not substitute\r\n  its judgment for that of the fact finder, which in this case is the Appellate\r\n  Panel.Â  See Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431,\r\n  435, 458 S.E.2d 76, 78 (Ct. App. 1995) (&quot;Where the medical evidence\r\n  conflicts, the findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive.&quot;); see\r\n    also Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 518, 544\r\n  S.E.2d 842, 846 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding when one doctor attributed employment\r\n  to injury and another doctor could not testify unequivocally about the source\r\n  of employee's injury, the Appellate Panel had the discretion to weigh the\r\n  testimony and deny the employee's claim). Â Because of the conflicting\r\n  evidence regarding the source of Brunson's respiratory problems and our limited\r\n  standard of review, we decline to find the circuit court abused its discretion\r\n  in affirming the Appellate Panel on this issue.Â  See Ballenger,\r\n  209 S.C. at 466-67, 40 S.E.2d at 682 (finding the Appellate Panel is given\r\n  discretion to weigh and consider all the evidence, both lay and expert, when\r\n  deciding whether causation has been established and while medical testimony is\r\n  entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if there is other\r\n  competent evidence in the record); see also Jones v. Harold Arnold's\r\n    Sentry Buick, Pontiac, 376 S.C. 375, 378, 656 S.E.2d 772, 774 (2008)\r\n  (internal citation omitted) (&quot;The possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's\r\n  finding from being supported by substantial evidence.&quot;).\r\nBrunson also contends she\r\n  presented credible lay testimony to substantiate her claims.Â  At the de novo\r\n  hearing, the single commissioner discredited Brunson's testimony.Â  The\r\n  commissioner stated: \r\n\r\n  Claimant's\r\n    testimony before this Commissioner was not credible. I base this finding on my\r\n    observations of the Claimant and on the delivery of her testimony.Â  Claimant\r\n    was extremely evasive on cross examination as to previous respiratory problems,\r\n    answering most questions with the response that she could not\r\n    &quot;remember&quot; or that she could not &quot;recall.&quot;\r\n\r\nBecause the single commissioner\r\n  had the benefit of observing Brunson before reaching her decision, we cannot\r\n  say the Appellate Panel and the circuit court erred in adopting the single\r\n  commissioner's finding on this issue.Â  See Fishburne v. ATI Sys. Int'l,\r\n  384 S.C. 76, 90, 681 S.E.2d 595, 602 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal citation\r\n  omitted) (&quot;It is logical for the [Appellate Panel], which did not have the\r\n  benefit of observing the witnesses, to give weight to the Hearing\r\n  Commissioner's opinion.&quot;).\r\nMoreover, while Brunson\r\n  claims it was error to disregard the testimony of certain lay witnesses who\r\n  testified on her behalf, it was again within the single commissioner's\r\n  discretion, and ultimately that of the Appellate Panel, to assess the\r\n  witnesses' credibility and weigh their testimony in reaching a decision.[3]Â  See Resort Servs.\r\n    Inc., 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495 (internal citation omitted)\r\n  (&quot;The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be\r\n  accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.&quot;).Â  Although\r\n  Brunson's supervisor and co-workers testified Brunson's respiratory problems\r\n  improved when she did not work in areas where she was exposed to chemicals,\r\n  each admitted they socialized with Brunson outside of work. Â In addition, Brunson's\r\n  supervisor stated he did not know what caused her respiratory problems.Â  After\r\n  hearing their testimony, the single commissioner found their testimony unpersuasive,\r\n  and the Appellate Panel agreed with this conclusion.Â  See Stone v.\r\n    Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (&quot;In an appeal from the [Appellate Panel], neither this court nor the\r\n  circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the [Appellate Panel] as\r\n  to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;). Â While this court may have\r\n  weighed the evidence differently, we are cognizant that this court is not the\r\n  ultimate fact-finder.Â  See Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C.\r\n  154, 160-61, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105-06 (1999) (finding this court erred in\r\n  substituting our judgment for that of the Appellate Panel because it was within\r\n  the Appellate Panel's discretion, as the ultimate fact-finder, to discount\r\n  medical evidence and choose between conflicting lay testimony in denying the\r\n  compensability of an employee's claim).Â  Despite evidence in the record that\r\n  would have permitted the single commissioner to find Brunson suffered a\r\n  compensable work-related injury, there is also evidence which would allow reasonable\r\n  minds to reach the conclusion she reached.Â  Id. at 161, 519 S.E.2d at\r\n  106 (&quot;Although there was evidence from which the Commissioner could have\r\n  gone the other way, there is also clearly evidence which would allow reasonable\r\n  minds to reach the conclusion he reached.&quot;). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit\r\n  court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n[1] Brunson v. Am. Koyo Bearings, 367 S.C. 161, 623 S.E.2d 870 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  \r\n[2] In reviewing Dr. Whitley's testimony, we do not condone his\r\n  unprofessional remarks in Brunson's medical treatment reports.Â  However, we\r\n  find his professionalism goes to the weight of his testimony and to his\r\n  credibility.Â  Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 340,\r\n  513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999) (&quot;Expert medical testimony is designed to aid\r\n  the Commission in coming to the correct conclusion; therefore, the Commission\r\n  determines the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.&quot;).\r\n[3] Brunson also claims the single commissioner lacked the jurisdiction on\r\n  remand to make any credibility findings by virtue of Koyo's failure to\r\n  challenge these witnesses' credibility and testimony in its initial appeal to\r\n  the Appellate Panel.Â  While Brunson is not required to relitigate unchallenged\r\n  findings, the compensability and source of Brunson's respiratory issues were at\r\n  issue in the de novo hearing, which necessarily includes any evidence and\r\n  testimony pertaining to that issue.Â  See Brunson, 367 S.C. at\r\n  165, 623 S.E.2d at 872 (&quot;Brunson, however, is not required to relitigate\r\n  unchallenged findings - which are law of the case - including Employer's\r\n  admission in connection with the contact dermatitis injury.&quot;); see also Green v.

(NARP) argues the circuit court erred in denying its motion for a directed\r\n  verdict because no evidence existed that P.J. Richardson (Richardson) had an\r\n  ownership interest in NARP or had a contractual right to purchase an ownership\r\n  interest in NARP.Â  Richardson cross-appeals, contending the circuit court erred\r\n  in upholding the jury verdict ordering specific performance of the contract\r\n  with a fair market valuation of the stock. Â We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn January 1, 2000, Bob\r\n  Castellani (Castellani), on behalf of NARP, and Richardson, on behalf of Reeves\r\n  Manufacturing, Inc. (Reeves), entered into an agreement (the 2000 Agreement),\r\n  in which the parties agreed to pay each other commissions equal to twenty-five\r\n  percent of the taxable income of their companies for cross-selling each other's\r\n  respective products.Â  Moreover, the parties agreed to issue twenty-five percent\r\n  of their companies' respective capital stock to each other.Â  After several\r\n  years of each company operating under this agreement, it is undisputed the\r\n  parties orally modified the 2000 Agreement by reducing the percentages of stock\r\n  from twenty-five percent to seven and one-half percent at a meeting in\r\n  Charleston, South Carolina (the Charleston Agreement).Â  At trial, the parties\r\n  testified the percentages were reduced, in part, because Richardson began\r\n  negotiating with a third party for the sale of Reeves.Â  Although the parties\r\n  agree that the Charleston Agreement modified the percentages of stock from twenty-five\r\n  percent to seven and one-half percent, the parties dispute the method of\r\n  payment.Â  Richardson contends the parties agreed that Richardson could acquire seven\r\n  and one-half percent ownership interest in NARP in exchange for the monetary\r\n  value of seven and one-half percent of the proceeds from the pending sale of Reeves.Â \r\n  NARP argues there was never an agreement where it would accept a cash payment\r\n  from Richardson in exchange for seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock, but\r\n  insisted instead that the Charleston Agreement was a &quot;like for like&quot;\r\n  exchange in each other's companies.Â  In short, there is conflicting testimony\r\n  as to the method of payment, and the Charleston Agreement is silent on this\r\n  term.\r\nSeveral months after the\r\n  Charleston Agreement, Richardson's attorney drafted an &quot;Agreement of\r\n  Termination, Settlement, and Release&quot; (the Termination Agreement).Â  Richardson\r\n  signed the Termination Agreement on behalf of Reeves on November 4, 2004, and Castellani\r\n  signed the same agreement on behalf of NARP several days later.Â  The\r\n  Termination Agreement provided, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp; Termination of the 2000 Outline.Â  The parties agree that the 2000 Outline and any and\r\n    all agreements, understandings, undertakings, or arrangements that in any way\r\n    arose or may have arisen out of or relate in any manner to the 2000 Outline,\r\n    are terminated.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp; Settlement. All claims and potential claims of any nature\r\n    whatsoever that have been, could have been, or in the future could be asserted\r\n    by the parties arising out of or relating in any manner to the 2000 Outline are\r\n    hereby settled, compromised and released for and in consideration of the\r\n    payment by [Reeves/Richardson] of the sum of $100.00 in lawful money of the\r\n    United States of America to NARP and [Castellani].\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp; [Reeves and Richardson] Release. NARP and [Castellani] hereby remise, release and\r\n    forever discharge each [other], along with their respective directors,\r\n    officers, stockholders, controlling persons, employees, agents, predecessors,\r\n    successors and assigns, and agents, of and from all, and all manner of,\r\n    actions, causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckonings,\r\n    bonds, bills, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, promises,\r\n    variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, executions, claims and demands\r\n    whatsoever, whether in law or equity, which NARP and/or [Castellani] had, now\r\n    have or which any personal representative, heir, predecessor, successor or\r\n    assign of NARP and/or [Castellani] can, shall or may have against [Reeves or\r\n    Richardson] or their respective directors, officers, stockholders, controlling\r\n    persons, employees, agents, predecessors, successors and assigns, arising out\r\n    of or relating to the 2000 Outline from and beginning of time to the date of\r\n    this Settlement Agreement. Â It is specifically agreed and understood by the\r\n    parties that the foregoing release is not intended to, and shall not, release\r\n    any of the parties from that certain, separate Option Agreement dated [15\r\n      Dec], 2004 pursuant to which NARP and [Castellani] have granted\r\n    [Richardson] an option to purchase 7.5% of the capital stock of NARP.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;NARP and [Castellani] Release.Â Â  [Reeves] and [Richardson] hereby remise, release\r\n    and forever discharge each [other], along with their respective directors,\r\n    officers, stockholders, controlling persons, employees, agents, predecessors,\r\n    successors and assigns, and agents, of and from all, and all manner of,\r\n    actions, causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts,\r\n    reckonings, bonds, bills, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements,\r\n    promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, executions, claims and\r\n    demands whatsoever, whether in law or equity, which [Reeves] and/or\r\n    [Richardson] had, now have or which any personal representative, heir,\r\n    predecessor, successor or assign of [Reeves] and/or [Richardson] can, shall or\r\n    may have against [NARP or Castellani] or their respective directors, officers,\r\n    stockholders, controlling persons, employees, agents, predecessors, successors\r\n    and assigns, arising out of or relating to the 2000 Outline from and beginning\r\n    of time to the date of this Settlement Agreement. Â It is specifically agreed and\r\n    understood by the parties that the foregoing release is not intended to, and\r\n    shall not, release any of the parties from that certain, separate Option\r\n      Agreement dated [15 Dec], 2004 pursuant to which NARP and [Castellani] have\r\n    granted [Richardson] an option to purchase 7.5% of the capital stock of NARP.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and\r\n    understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter contained herein,\r\n    and merges all prior discussions and agreements, both oral and written,\r\n      between the parties.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  To\r\n    complicate matters further, the parties concede that no written option\r\n    agreement dated December 15, 2004 existed at the time of the Termination\r\n    Agreement.Â  Moreover, the parties never entered into an option agreement dated\r\nDecember 15, 2004.Â  \r\n  In January 2005, Richardson\r\n    sold one-hundred percent of Reeves to a third party.Â  The parties continued to\r\n    discuss the terms of a potential agreement, including the exchange of several\r\n    proposals, but NARP and Richardson never reached an agreement.Â  On April 17,\r\n    2007, Richardson sent NARP a demand letter, advising NARP that Richardson\r\n    &quot;now desires to exercise his option to purchase&quot; seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock &quot;under the terms of the October\r\n    4, 2004 Option Agreement.&quot;[1]Â \r\n    NARP responded to the demand letter by instituting this suit seeking a\r\n    declaratory judgment on the matter.Â  Richardson filed an answer and counterclaim,\r\n    alleging breach of contract and demanded specific performance.Â  Richardson also\r\n    asserted relief under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.Â  During the course\r\n    of the litigation, Richardson filed multiple amended answers and counterclaims.Â \r\n    In addition, the circuit court granted Richardson's motion to amend the\r\n    pleadings to conform to the evidence presented at trial under Rule 15(b),\r\n    SCRCP. \r\n  As a result of the\r\n    conflicting testimony throughout the trial, the circuit court refused NARP's\r\n    multiple requests for a directed verdict.Â  Without objection, the circuit court\r\n    submitted the case to the jury under a special verdict form to answer the\r\n    fundamental question of whether Richardson had the right to acquire seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock and, if so, at what price.Â  The jury\r\n    returned a verdict finding Richardson was entitled to receive seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock, but Richardson should pay $2,936,300\r\n    for the stock.Â  Following the verdict, the circuit court denied NARP's\r\n    post-trial motions for directed verdict, new trial absolute, judgment\r\n    notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial under the thirteenth juror\r\n    doctrine. Â In addition, Richardson unsuccessfully moved for the circuit court\r\n    to &quot;reform the verdict&quot; on the basis that the &quot;number is\r\n    something that [Richardson] can't see already in evidence.&quot;Â  The circuit\r\n    court confirmed the jury verdict in favor\r\n    of Richardson and granted specific performance as found by the jury.Â  \r\n  NARP appeals, contending the circuit\r\n    court erred in denying its directed verdict motion on all contract claims and\r\n    on promissory estoppel.Â  Richardson cross-appeals, arguing the judgment amount\r\n    for specific performance should be $415,988, not $2,936,300 as provided in the\r\n    jury verdict.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  When considering a directed\r\n    verdict motion, the circuit court should view the evidence and all reasonable\r\n    inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Sabb v.\r\n      S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002) (citing Steinke\r\n        v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520\r\n    S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999)).Â  &quot;If more than one reasonable inference can be\r\n    drawn . . . the case should be submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Chaney v.\r\n      Burgess, 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1965) (citing Mahon v.\r\n        Spartanburg Cnty., 205 S.C. 441, 449, 32 S.E.2d 368, 371 (1944)).Â  The circuit\r\n    court should be &quot;concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n    evidence,&quot; not its credibility or weight.Â  Jones v. Gen. Elec. Co.,\r\n    331 S.C. 351, 356, 503 S.E.2d 173, 176 (1998) (citing Garrett v. Locke,\r\n    309 S.C. 94, 99, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  An appellate court will\r\n    only reverse the circuit court's ruling when no evidence supports the ruling or\r\n    when the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Steinke, 336 S.C. at\r\n    386, 520 S.E.2d at 148. Â Â \r\n  An action for specific performance\r\n    is one in equity. Â Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 262, 603 S.E.2d 625,\r\n    627 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  &quot;In reviewing a proceeding in equity, this court may\r\n    find facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Â Greer\r\n      v. Spartanburg Technical Coll., 338 S.C. 76, 79, 524 S.E.2d 856, 858 (Ct.\r\n    App. 1999).Â  &quot;This broad scope of review does not require this court to\r\n    ignore the findings below when the circuit court was in a better position to\r\n    evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;Moreover,\r\n    the appellant is not relieved of his burden of convincing the appellate court\r\n    the [circuit court] committed error in its findings.&quot;Â  Pinckney v.\r\nWarren, 344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001). Â Â \r\n  Additionally, &quot;[a] legal\r\n    question in an equity case receives review as in law.&quot;Â  Sloan v.\r\n      Greenville Cnty., 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Because\r\n    questions of law may be decided with no particular deference to the circuit\r\n    court, this court may correct errors of law in both legal and equitable\r\n    actions. Â See I'On, LLC v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n    411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp.\r\n    1998)). \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI.&nbsp; NARP's Appeal  \r\n  NARP argues the circuit court\r\n    erred in denying its directed verdict motion on Richardson's contract and\r\n    promissory estoppel claims on the grounds that the Termination Agreement\r\n    unambiguously and unequivocally terminated all rights and promises under the\r\n  2000 agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\n  In ruling on motions for\r\n    directed verdict, &quot;the [circuit] court is\r\n    required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn\r\n    therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to\r\n    deny the motions whe[n] either the evidence yields more than one inference or\r\n    its inference is in doubt.&quot;Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C.\r\n    424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  This court will reverse the circuit\r\n    court's rulings on directed verdict motions only when there is no evidence to\r\n    support the rulings or when the rulings are controlled by an error of law. Â See Hinkle v. Nat'l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618\r\n    (2003) (internal citation omitted).Â  After viewing the evidence in a light most\r\n    favorable to Richardson, as our standard of review requires, we find the\r\n    circuit court properly denied NARP's directed verdict motion.\r\n  \r\n    NARP maintains the merger clause of the Termination\r\n    Agreement between the parties ended any and all rights that Richardson had or\r\n    may have to own or purchase any NARP stock.Â  However, considered in the light\r\n    most favorable to Richardson, there is evidence from which the jury could find\r\n    the document containing the termination provision was only a single portion of\r\n    an overarching, three-step agreement between the parties.Â  At trial, Richardson\r\n    presented evidence that a tripartite agreement was never fully executed and, as\r\n    a result, the parties continued to be bound by the Charleston Agreement.Â \r\n    Richardson and his wife both testified the Termination Agreement was only one part\r\n    of a tripartite agreement, which also included Richardson's right to purchase\r\n    seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock in exchange for a charitable\r\n    donation to Dobson Ministries in the amount equivalent to seven and one-half\r\n    percent of the sale of Reeves.Â  In addition, Richardson's former attorney, Rod\r\n    Manning (Manning), offered similar testimony consistent with the position that\r\n    the Termination Agreement was part of a larger, tripartite agreement. \r\n  In denying NARP's multiple\r\n    motions for directed verdict, the circuit court properly considered the existence\r\n    of this conflicting evidence.Â  See Garrett, 309 S.C. at 99, 419\r\n    S.E.2d at 845 (stating that the circuit court should not be concerned with the\r\n    credibility or weight of evidence, only its existence).Â  The circuit court\r\n    stated,Â  \r\n  \r\n    Y'all\r\n      might be certain that you entered into that November 8, 2004\r\n      termination agreement but I don't think the evidence shows that.Â  I don't know\r\n      if you did or not.Â  Number one.Â  And the terms of the contract are absolutely\r\n      ambigious [sic].Â  Read as a whole, it borders on being completely\r\n      un-understandable.Â  So all these matters barring some change from the evidence\r\n      presented by the defense and all these issues are going to go to the jury.\r\n  \r\nIn denying NARP's motion for\r\n    a directed verdict again at the close of the evidence, the circuit court stated\r\n  &quot;the testimony is conflicting&quot; and NARP's position &quot;certainly is\r\n    a possible conclusion that the jury can come to[, b]ut there is more than\r\n  one.&quot; \r\n  There may be a basis for the\r\n    fact-finder to reject the testimony of Richardson, his wife, and Manning, but\r\n    that credibility determination lies with the jury, not the court, at the\r\n    directed verdict stage.Â  See Sabb, 350 S.C. at 427, 567 S.E.2d at\r\n    236 (noting a circuit court must deny a directed verdict motion when the\r\n    evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt).Â  We hold\r\n    the evidence under the proper standard of review presented a question of fact\r\n    as to whether a contract existed between the parties.Â  Accordingly, we affirm\r\n    the circuit court's denial of NARP's directed verdict motions.Â  Id. (stating an appellate court will reverse the circuit court's decision to deny a\r\n    directed verdict motion only when no evidence supports the ruling below).Â  \r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp;Richardson's Cross-Appeal  \r\n  \r\nA.&nbsp; Standing   \r\n  As an initial matter, NARP\r\n    contends Richardson does not have standing to appeal because Richardson is not\r\n    an aggrieved party and, therefore, does not have the right to appeal.Â  See Rule 201, SCACR; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-1-30 (1976).Â  We find this position\r\n  without merit.\r\n  Rule 201(b) limits the\r\n    ability to appeal to &quot;[o]nly a party aggrieved by an order, judgment . . .\r\n    or decision . . . .&quot;Â  Rule 201(b), SCACR.Â  This court has previously\r\n    explained that under Rule 201(b), &quot;[t]he word 'aggrieved' refers to a\r\n    substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right, or the\r\n    imposition on a party of a burden or obligation.&quot; Â Beaufort Realty Co.\r\n      v. Beaufort Cnty., 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (Ct. App. 2001).Â \r\n    &quot;A party is aggrieved by a judgment or decree when it operates on his or\r\n    her rights of property or bears directly on his or her interest.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n  In the instant case,\r\n    Richardson contends he entered into a contract requiring him to pay seven and one-half percent of the sale of Reeves in\r\n    exchange for seven and one-half percent of stock in NARP.Â  The jury's verdict\r\n    granted specific performance in favor of Richardson, but the judgment required Richardson\r\n    pay $2,936,000, instead of $415,988, which is the equivalent to seven and\r\n    one-half percent of the proceeds from the sale of Reeves.Â  The law recognizes\r\n    that despite having been a &quot;winning&quot; party below, a party can still be\r\n    aggrieved by a judgment of the court.Â  See Cobb v. Benjamin, 325\r\n    S.C. 573, 580, 482 S.E.2d 589, 592-93 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding party was\r\n    aggrieved and appeal was proper despite judgment essentially granting relief\r\n    the party requested); Cisson v. McWhorter, 255 S.C. 174, 178, 177 S.E.2d\r\n    603, 605 (1970) (stating an aggrieved party is defined as a person who is aggrieved\r\n    by a judgment or decree &quot;when it operates on his rights of\r\n    property or bears directly upon his interest, the word aggrieved referring to a\r\n    substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right or the\r\n    imposition on a party of a burden or obligation&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n    Richardson is an aggrieved party in a legal sense and, therefore, has standing\r\n    to appeal. \r\n  \r\nB.&nbsp;Â Preservation  \r\n  NARP also asserts\r\n    Richardson's argument on cross-appeal is not preserved for our review because Richardson\r\n    failed to challenge the circuit court's ruling at trial and does not\r\n  specifically raise the issue on appeal.Â  We disagree. \r\n  It is well settled that an\r\n    issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n    to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved.Â  See generally Holy Loch Distribs.,\r\n      Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000); Staubes\r\n        v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â \r\n    Moreover, our courts have adhered to the rule that when an issue has not been\r\n    ruled upon by the circuit court or raised in a post-trial motion, such issue\r\n    may not be considered on appeal. See SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox,\r\n    301 S.C. 493, 499, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793 (1990) (finding an issue never ruled on\r\n    by the circuit court or raised in an appropriate post-trial motion is not\r\n    preserved for review).\r\n  After the jury granted\r\n    specific performance in favor of Richardson and found that he was entitled to\r\n    receive seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock upon paying $2,936,300,\r\n    Richardson made the following motion:\r\n  \r\n    [W]e'd\r\n      ask for JNOV based on the 13th jury doctrine for the Court to reform the\r\n      verdict in that the basis for the number [i.e. $2,936,300] is something that I\r\n      can't see already in evidence.[2]\r\n  \r\nIt is evident that Richardson\r\n    made a post-trial motion objecting to the amount the jury determined NARP was\r\n    entitled to receive in exchange for seven and one-half percent of its stock.Â \r\n  In response, the circuit court denied Richardson's post-trial motion stating,\r\n  &quot;there is sufficient evidence in the record which would support the jury's\r\n    verdicts in the amount set forth based upon the evidence presented.&quot;Â  As a\r\n    result, this issue was raised and ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  Richardson properly\r\n    appeals this issue, arguing the circuit court's grant of specific performance\r\n    should be for $415,988, the contract amount Richardson alleges was agreed to by\r\n    the parties in the Charleston Agreement.Â  Accordingly, we find Richardson properly\r\n  preserved and raised this issue on appeal. Â \r\n  \r\nC. Â Specific Performance  \r\n  In his cross-appeal,\r\n    Richardson contends the circuit court properly entered a judgment of specific\r\n    performance based upon the jury's answers to the interrogatories on the special\r\n    verdict form, but erred in determining the amount Richardson must pay for seven\r\n  and one-half percent of NARP's stock.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Although an action for\r\n    specific performance is one in equity, the record indicates the parties and the\r\n    court treated this case as one in law, submitting issues of fact to a jury. Â See Horn v. Davis Elec. Constructors, Inc., 302 S.C. 484, 487, 395 S.E.2d 724,\r\n    725-26 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding parties implicitly agreed to trial by consent\r\n    in equity action for retaliatory discharge when parties and court treated case\r\n    as law case with submission of issues of fact to jury and court did not\r\n    consider jury as advisory only).Â  Moreover, the record conclusively\r\n    demonstrates the circuit court intended that the jury would decide all\r\n    questions of fact in this case, including the price for the stock, as evidenced\r\n    by the special verdict form submitted to the jury without objection.[3]Â  Accordingly,\r\n    the circuit court had the responsibility to enter an order consistent with the\r\n    jury's findings if there was any evidence to support such findings.Â Â  See Johnstone v. Matthews, 183 S.C. 360, 366, 191 S.E. 223, 225 (1937)\r\n    (holding when issues of fact in equity cases are tried to a jury and findings\r\n    of fact are made, if there is any evidence to support them, the findings are\r\n    conclusive of the issues submitted).\r\n  Here, the circuit court did\r\n    not err in granting specific performance in the amount the jury determined\r\n    because it is an appropriate remedy under the evidence presented in this case.Â \r\n    At trial, Richardson presented the testimony of Mike Melinger (Melinger), an\r\n    expert witness qualified in the field of business evaluations, to detail the\r\n    fair market value of NARP's stock.Â  Over NARP's objections, the circuit court\r\n    ruled the expert witness could testify and informed the parties that the jury\r\n    would have to decide the amount Richardson would have to pay for the stock if Richardson\r\n    was entitled to it.Â  Melinger testified he applied the industry standard lack\r\n    of control discount and a lack of marketability discount to the two estimated\r\n    values of $150,000,000 and $80,000,000 placed on NARP's company.Â  Melinger\r\n    further testified that &quot;[a]t 150 million dollars, the [seven and one-half percent] interest would be worth\r\n    $5,750,000.Â  At 80 million dollars, [seven and one-half percent] interest would\r\n    be worth $3,000,120.&quot;\r\n  Once\r\n    in deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the court concerning number\r\n    eight on the verdict form.Â  The jury inquired: &quot;If we [find Richardson is entitled\r\n    to NARP's stock], will P.J. Richardson be required to purchase 7.5% of\r\n    NARP common stock at current market value[?]&quot; (emphasis in original).Â  The\r\n    circuit court advised the jury that it &quot;must assign some value for the\r\n    stock if&quot; the jury answered question number eight in the affirmative.Â  Utilizing\r\n    the fair market value of $80,000,000, the jury's determination that Richardson\r\n    must pay $2,936,300 for seven and one-half\r\n    percent of NARP's stock is within the range of the expert witness' testimony. See Buzhardt v. Cromer, 272 S.C. 159, 163, 249 S.E.2d 898, 900 (1978)\r\n    (holding when the amount of the verdict falls within the range of amounts\r\n    testified to, the verdict cannot be disturbed on the ground of excessiveness).Â \r\n    Furthermore, in denying Richardson's post-trial motion, the circuit court\r\n    stated:\r\n  I do\r\n    find that there is sufficient evidence in the record which would support the\r\n    jury's verdict in the amount set forth based upon the evidence presented\r\n    [including] the different dates as far as the evaluation over a period of years\r\n    that the jury could have used in this particular matter to arrive at that\r\n    verdict.Â  And I find it's well within their discretion and the facts and\r\n    evidence in this case.\r\n  As a result, we find ample\r\n    evidence in the record to support the jury's verdict.Â  Moreover, Richardson has\r\n    not presented, and we do not find, any compelling reasons to invade the jury's\r\n    province and alter the amount in the verdict.Â  See Bailey v. Peacock,\r\n    318 S.C. 13, 14, 455 S.E.2d 690, 691 (1995) (stating compelling reasons must be\r\n    given to justify invading the jury's province).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  In granting Richardson seven\r\n    and one-half percent of NARP's stock in exchange for $2,936,300, the jury's\r\n    verdict is supported by the evidence in the record.Â  See Johnstone,\r\n    183 S.C. at 366, 191 S.E. at 225 (holding when issues of fact in equity cases\r\n    are tried to a jury and findings of fact are made, if there is any evidence to\r\n    support them, the findings are conclusive of the issues submitted).Â  Accordingly,\r\n    we affirm the circuit court's entry of specific performance and hold Richardson\r\n    must pay $2,936,300 for seven and one-half percent of NARP's stock. Â \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  Accordingly, the circuit\r\n    court's order is \r\n  AFFIRMED. \r\n  SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n    concur. Â \r\n[1] Â Richardson conceded at trial that the option\r\n  agreement dated October 4, 2004 was never finally agreed to by both parties.\r\n[2] Â Although Richardson's counsel has confused the\r\n  language of the post-trial motion he wished to employ, as we interpret the\r\n  record, it is entirely clear to this court that Richardson's counsel moved for\r\n  a new trial nisi remittitur based upon counsel's desire to &quot;reform the\r\n  verdict&quot; and his statement that the jury's &quot;number is something that\r\n  [he] can't see already in evidence.&quot;Â  Counsel's statements, coupled with\r\n  the circuit court's ruling, support this interpretation.Â  See James\r\n    v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 193, 638 S.E.2d 667, 670 (2006)\r\n  (&quot;A motion for a new trial nisi remittitur asks the [circuit] court to\r\n  reduce the verdict because the [jury's] verdict is merely excessive.&quot;). Â Accordingly,\r\n  we treat Richardson's post-trial motion as a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  \r\n[3] Â The circuit court submitted the case to the\r\n  jury under a special verdict form that asked numerous contract questions, which\r\n  the jury answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.

(Blue Ribbon) appeals in this default negligence action.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGlenda Wilder filed this\r\n  action against Blue Ribbon and Freddie W. Pryor, which alleged negligence\r\n  arising from an automobile accident.[1]Â \r\n  Wilder provided an affidavit of service on Blue Ribbon, alleging service was\r\n  made on May 12, 2006, to Barbara Dotson, Blue Ribbon's president and person\r\n  authorized to accept service.Â  In April 2007, Wilder moved for entry of\r\n  default.Â  The Honorable Alison R. Lee granted the motion.\r\nBlue Ribbon moved to set\r\n  aside the entry of default and provided Dotson's affidavit stating she did\r\n  &quot;not recall ever personally receiving a copy&quot; of the summons and\r\n  complaint.Â  At a hearing before the Honorable James R. Barber, Wilder argued\r\n  Blue Ribbon did not have a meritorious defense because it was a &quot;clear\r\n  liability case&quot; due to the taxi rear-ending Wilder.Â  Judge Barber asked\r\n  Blue Ribbon's counsel: &quot;You all acknowledge that it's a clear\r\n  negligence?&quot; Counsel conceded, stating &quot;I think that's the case, Your\r\n  Honor.&quot;Â  Counsel also stated:Â  &quot;[W]e're fine having a non-jury\r\n  [trial] . . . .&quot;Â  Judge Barber denied the motion to set aside the entry of\r\n  default, finding Blue Ribbon's explanation insufficient and stating that\r\n  &quot;[s]imply because Ms. Dotson does 'not recall' being personally served is\r\n  not 'good cause' as required by Rule 55(c), SCRCP.&quot;Â  Furthermore, he found\r\n  Blue Ribbon failed to show other reasons why it should be relieved from\r\n  default: (1) Blue Ribbon lacked a meritorious defense; (2) the timing of the\r\n  motion to set aside entry of default was late at nearly a year after service;\r\n  and (3) Wilder would be prejudiced if the matter was further delayed while Blue\r\n  Ribbon conducted discovery on issues not truly in dispute, such as liability.Â \r\n  Blue Ribbon requested additional time for discovery, and Judge Barber allowed\r\n  sixty additional days for discovery related to damages.\r\nThe Honorable G. Thomas\r\n  Cooper, Jr., presided over the damages hearing.Â  Wilder testified she was\r\n  rear-ended by the Blue Ribbon taxi on August 27, 2005, injuring her neck,\r\n  shoulder, and lower back.Â  She was treated at Providence Hospital, by her\r\n  family doctor, and in physical therapy.Â  Wilder missed forty hours of work at\r\n  $27.70 per hour.[2]Â \r\n  Wilder testified she suffered &quot;a lot of pain due to the accident.&quot;Â \r\n  At the time of the hearing, nearly three years after the accident, Wilder still\r\n  suffered pain when standing or sitting for long periods of time.Â  Wilder\r\n  introduced total economic damages of $5,682.56, including lost wages of $1,108,\r\n  property damage of $808, and medical expenses of $3,766.56.Â  \r\n\r\nJudge Cooper\r\n  awarded damages of $20,682.56, including the $5,682.56 in economic damages and\r\n  $15,000 for &quot;pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional\r\n  distress, and mental anguish (past, present and future).&quot;Â  Judge Cooper\r\n  denied Blue Ribbon's post-trial motion.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  In an action at law, when a\r\n    case is tried without a jury, the trial court's findings of fact will be\r\n    upheld on appeal when they are reasonably supported by the evidence. Â Townes\r\n      Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n    (1976).Â  The trial court's findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless\r\n    wholly unsupported by the evidence or unless it clearly appears the findings were influenced or\r\n    controlled by an error of law.Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street,\r\n      LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 127-28, 631 S.E.2d 252, 255-56 (2006). Â The trial court's findings\r\nequivalent to a jury's findings in a law action.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion to Set Aside Entry\r\n  of Default\r\nBlue Ribbon first argues\r\n    Judge Barber erred in failing to set aside the entry of default.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The standard for granting\r\n    relief from an entry of default is &quot;good cause&quot; as prescribed by the South\r\n    Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Rule 55(c), SCRCP\r\n    (&quot;For good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default . . . .&quot;); see Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499,\r\n    501 (Ct. App. 1989) (explaining the standard for granting relief under Rule\r\n    55(c) is &quot;good cause&quot;).Â  &quot;This standard requires a party seeking\r\n    relief from an entry of default . . . to provide an explanation for the default\r\n    and give reasons why vacation of the default entry would serve the interests of\r\n    justice.&quot;Â  Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus., Inc., 383 S.C.\r\n    601, 607, 681 S.E.2d 885, 888 (2009).Â  &quot;Once a party has put forth a\r\n    satisfactory explanation . . . the trial court must also consider [the Wham factors]: (1) the timing of the\r\n    motion for relief; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3)\r\n    the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted.&quot; Â Id. at 607-08, 681 S.E.2d at 888 (citing Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d\r\n    at 501-02).Â  A trial court is not required to make specific findings of fact\r\n    for each factor if there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the\r\n    trial court's decision.Â  Sundown, 383 S.C. at 608, 681 S.E.2d\r\n    at 888. Â The decision whether to set aside an entry of default is within the\r\n    sound discretion of the trial court. Â Williams v. Vanvolkenburg, 312\r\n    S.C. 373, 375, 440 S.E.2d 408, 409 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n  Blue Ribbon initially argues the trial court erred in\r\n    finding it was served.Â  We find there was evidence in the record to support the\r\n    trial court's finding of service.Â  Judge Barber considered the affidavits of\r\n    the process server and Dotson.Â  Wilder argued Dotson's affidavit did not state\r\n    Blue Ribbon was not served; rather, just that she did not recall ever\r\n    personally receiving a copy of the summons and complaint.Â  Based on the\r\n    affidavits, Judge Barber concluded, &quot;In a situation like this, when it comes\r\n    down to just he says/she says, I'm going with the process server.&quot;Â  We\r\n    discern no reversible error by Judge Barber in his finding that Blue Ribbon was\r\n    served.Â  See id. (stating a trial court's decision on whether to\r\n    set aside an entry of default will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is\r\n    without evidentiary support or controlled by an error of law).\r\n  Under the Wham factors, we likewise find no abuse of discretion in Judge Barber's finding that\r\n    Blue Ribbon did not show good cause sufficient to relieve it from the entry of\r\n    default.Â  As to the first factor, the timing of the motion for relief, more\r\n    than a year elapsed between the time Blue Ribbon was served with the summons\r\n    and complaint and when it moved\r\n    for relief.Â  Regarding a meritorious defense, the second factor, Judge Barber\r\n    accepted Blue Ribbon's acknowledgment that it had no meritorious defense to\r\n    liability.Â  Finally, as to the degree of prejudice to Wilder, Judge Barber\r\n    recognized Wilder's argument that she\r\n    would be prejudiced if the matter was further delayed while Blue Ribbon\r\n    conducted discovery on an issue such as liability, which was not in dispute.Â \r\n    We find evidence to support Judge Barber's decision and affirm the denial of\r\n    the motion to set aside entry of default.Â  See Stark Truss Co. v. Superior Constr. Corp., 360 S.C. 503,\r\n    512, 602 S.E.2d 99, 104 (Ct. App. 2004) (affirming the trial court's refusal to\r\n    set aside the entry of default where there was evidence to support the trial\r\n    court's decision). \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical Expenses    \r\n  \r\n    Blue Ribbon next\r\n    argues Judge Cooper erred by including medical expenses as an element of\r\n    damages because there was no expert testimony, and the only evidence that\r\n    Wilder's &quot;medical bills were a result of injuries she sustained in the\r\n      accident&quot; was her own testimony.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\n  \r\n    At the damages\r\n    hearing, Wilder testified she was injured as a result of the accident.Â  She\r\n    felt numbness, &quot;like a rush to [her] head, kind of dizziness and throbbing\r\n    pain in [her] lower back.&quot;Â  She went to the Providence Hospital emergency\r\n    room, was x-rayed, and was given pain medication.Â  A couple of days later, she\r\n    was again treated at Providence Hospital for follow-up care and was sent to\r\n    physical therapy for evaluation.Â  Wilder testified the hospital personnel at\r\n    her second visit recommended she consult her family physician.Â  Wilder followed\r\n    up with her family physician, who prescribed medication and physical therapy.Â \r\n    Wilder had three follow-up visits with her physician, and physical therapy at\r\n    Providence Hospital and First Choice Rehabilitation.Â  Wilder missed five days\r\n    of work after the accident.\r\nThe admission of\r\n    evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Gamble\r\n      v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441\r\n    (1996).Â  On appeal, this court will not disturb a trial court's evidentiary\r\n    rulings absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Hofer v. St. Clair, 298\r\n  S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 (1989).\r\n  &quot;An action in tort for\r\n    damages is an action at law.&quot;Â  Judy v. Judy, 383 S.C. 1, 6, 677\r\n    S.E.2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;In a law case, the credibility and\r\n    weight to be accorded evidence is solely for the fact finder to\r\n    determine.&quot;Â  Hanna v. Palmetto Homes, Inc., 300 S.C. 535, 537, 389\r\n    S.E.2d 164, 165 (Ct. App. 1990); see Parsons v. Georgetown Steel,\r\n    318 S.C. 63, 67, 456 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1995) (stating the credibility and weight\r\n    of testimony is for the trier of fact).Â  &quot;Expert testimony is not required\r\n    to prove proximate cause if the common knowledge or experience of a layperson\r\n    is extensive enough.&quot;Â  O'Leary-Payne v. R.R. Hilton Head, II, Inc.,\r\n    371 S.C. 340, 349, 638 S.E.2d 96, 101 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;[W]here physical\r\n    injury is coincident with or immediately follows an accident and is naturally\r\n    and directly connected with it lay testimony may be sufficient to carry to the\r\n    triers of the facts the issue of whether or not the accident proximately caused\r\n    it . . . .&quot; Roscoe v. Grubb, 237 S.C. 590, 596, 118 S.E.2d 337, 340\r\n    (1961); see Armstrong v. Weiland, 267 S.C. 12, 16, 225 S.E.2d\r\n    851, 853 (1976) (&quot;When the testimony of an expert witness is not relied\r\n    upon to establish proximate cause, it is sufficient for plaintiff to put forth\r\n    some evidence which rises above mere speculation or conjecture . . . .&quot;).\r\n  We find Judge Cooper did not\r\n    err in admitting Wilder's own testimony of her injuries and the medical bills.Â  See Pearson v. Bridges, 337 S.C. 524, 530, 524 S.E.2d 108, 111\r\n    (Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;In personal injury\r\n    actions, great latitude is allowed in the introduction of evidence to aid in\r\n    determining the extent of damages; . . . [A]ny evidence which tends to\r\n    establish the nature, character, and extent of injuries which are the natural\r\n    and proximate consequences of defendant's acts is admissible . . . .&quot;).\r\n  \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Damages for Permanent\r\n  Injury and the Future[3]  \r\n  \r\n    Blue Ribbon argues\r\n    the trial court erred in awarding damages for permanent injury and future pain\r\n    and suffering.Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n    Wilder testified\r\n    she continues to suffer pain from the accident and has trouble standing or\r\n    sitting for long periods of time.Â  She described the pain as &quot;dull because\r\n    it just feels like my back is going to give out.&quot;Â  Wilder testified she\r\n    had not suffered any similar symptoms before the accident.Â  Judge Cooper\r\n    concluded in his written order: &quot;[Wilder] is entitled to recover\r\n    $15,000.00 to compensate her for her pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of\r\n  life, emotional distress, and mental anguish (past, present and future).&quot;  \r\n  \r\n    The amount of\r\n    damages suffered in a personal injury action is a question for the\r\n    fact-finder.Â  See Hicks v. Herring, 246 S.C. 429, 436, 144 S.E.2d\r\n    151, 154 (1965) (finding the amount of damages awarded in a personal injury\r\n    action is a question for the jury). Future damages are generally recoverable in\r\n    personal injury actions as long as the damages are reasonably certain to result\r\n    in the future from the injury.Â  Haltiwanger v.

Blair, Manton M. Grier, Jr., and Kirsten Small, all of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        W. Douglas Smith and Shane William Rogers, both of Spartanburg,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:Â \r\n  This appeal arises from a bench trial resulting in an order awarding an\r\n  equitable lien to Respondent The Nutt Corporation d/b/a TNC Engineering (the\r\n  Nutt Corporation).Â  Appellant Howell Road, LLC (Howell Road) argues the trial\r\n  court erred in allowing the Nutt Corporation to proceed on an equitable claim\r\n  because an adequate remedy at law was available.Â  Alternatively, Howell Road\r\n  argues there was insufficient evidence to justify the creation of an equitable\r\n  lien and the trial court erred in denying its request to assert a laches\r\n  defense.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1998, Howell Road purchased a parcel of land in Spartanburg County (the Property)\r\n  and hired the Nutt Corporation to provide engineering services for the\r\n  development of the Property.Â  The parties orally agreed that the Nutt\r\n  Corporation's fee for its services would be six percent of the construction\r\n  costs of developing the land.Â  At the outset of the project, Howell Road had to\r\n  determine what type of development it wanted to build and the Nutt Corporation\r\n  provided Howell Road with multiple options.Â  Howell Road chose to proceed with\r\n  a mobile home rental park layout and instructed the Nutt Corporation to move\r\n  forward with the roads and storm water design.[1]Â \r\n  The design plans were subsequently completed, approved by Spartanburg County,\r\n  submitted to Howell Road, and used to obtain a grading permit.Â  However, Howell\r\n  Road never moved forward with the grading.\r\nOn July 9, 1999, the Nutt Corporation sent Howell Road\r\n  an invoice in the amount of $34,398.00 for its services related to the roads\r\n  and storm water design plans.Â  Howell Road never paid the Nutt\r\n  Corporation, but the parties proceeded as if the entire project would\r\n  eventually be completed.Â  On November 19, 2001, the parties memorialized much\r\n  of their earlier oral agreement regarding the project in a signed written\r\n  agreement.Â  Under the terms of the written agreement, Howell Road agreed to pay\r\n  six percent of the total construction costs of the project to the Nutt\r\n  Corporation in exchange for its engineering services.Â  The agreement provided\r\n  such payment was owed whether or not the project was ever constructed and would\r\n  become due and payable upon each construction invoice received or when the\r\n  property was sold.Â  Howell Road never moved forward with completing the\r\n  project, and the Nutt Corporation never received payment for the services it\r\n  provided.\r\nOn April 25, 2003, the Nutt Corporation filed a\r\n  complaint against Howell Road for breach of contract.Â  Howell Road answered, denying\r\n  the allegations in the complaint.Â  After discovery began, the Nutt\r\n  Corporation filed a motion to amend its complaint, which Howell Road opposed.Â \r\n  Following a hearing on the matter, the trial court granted the Nutt\r\n  Corporation's motion, and the Nutt Corporation subsequently filed an amended\r\n  complaint.Â  The amended complaint sought a declaratory judgment\r\n  establishing the debt and an equitable lien against the Property; it did not\r\n  assert a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  Howell Road filed an amended\r\n  answer and counterclaims for breach of contract and violation of Rule 11,\r\n  SCRCP.[2]Â  The parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  Howell\r\n  Road moved for partial summary judgment, arguing the Nutt Corporation's claims\r\n  were barred by the statute of limitations, lack of consideration, the statute\r\n  of frauds, and failure to establish a meeting of the minds.Â  The Nutt\r\n  Corporation moved for summary judgment in regard to Howell Road's counterclaims.Â \r\n  After a hearing on the matter, the trial court granted the Nutt Corporation's\r\n  motion for summary judgment and denied Howell Road's motion for partial summary\r\n  judgment.\r\nHowell Road filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter\r\n  or amend the order granting summary judgment on its counterclaims.Â  Howell Road\r\n  argued the trial court erred in determining the Nutt Corporation's claims were\r\n  equitable in nature, and therefore, not barred by the statute of limitations.Â \r\n  Howell Road also argued the Nutt Corporation's claims were not ripe.Â  The\r\n  trial court disagreed and issued an order denying Howell Road's motion to alter\r\n  or amend the judgment.Â  Howell Road then appealed to this court.Â \r\n  In an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the trial court's order on the\r\n  following grounds:Â  (1) Howell Road failed to assert its claim for breach of\r\n  contract within the three-year statute of limitations and (2) the denial of\r\n  summary judgment is not directly appealable.Â  The Nutt Corporation, d/b/a TNC Engineering, v. Howell Road, LLC, Op. No. 2008-UP-195 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 20,\r\n  2008).\r\nAfter a bench trial on the Nutt Corporation's cause of\r\n  action for declaratory judgment, the court found the Nutt Corporation was\r\n  entitled to an equitable lien in the amount of $34,398.00 against the Property.Â \r\n  Howell Road then filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment.Â  After a hearing on the matter, the trial court issued an order\r\n  denying Howell Road's motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWe\r\n  review factual findings and legal conclusions in an equitable action de novo.Â  Lewis\r\n    v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).Â  &quot;De novo\r\n  review permits appellate court fact-finding, notwithstanding the presence of\r\n  evidence supporting the trial court's findings.&quot;Â  Id. 392 S.C. at\r\n  390, 709 S.E.2d at 654.Â  However, this broad standard of review does not\r\n  require the appellate court to disregard the factual findings of the trial\r\n  court or ignore the fact that the trial court is in the better position to\r\n  assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C.\r\n  382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nHowell\r\n  Road argues the trial court erred in granting the Nutt Corporation an equitable\r\n  lien because an adequate remedy at law was available.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n&quot;For\r\n  an equitable lien to arise, there must be a debt, specific property to which\r\n  the debt attaches, and an expressed or implied intent that the property serve\r\n  as security for payment of the debt.&quot;Â  Regions Bank v. Wingard Props.,\r\n    Inc., Op. No. 4846 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 22, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\n  No. 21 at 83, 87-88) (quoting First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n of S.C. v.\r\n    Finn, 300 S.C. 228, 231, 387 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1989)).Â  &quot;The function\r\n  of equity is to supplement the law, not to displace it.&quot;Â  Wigfall v.\r\n    Tideland Utilities, Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 117, 580 S.E.2d 100, 108 (2003)\r\n  (internal quotations and citation omitted).Â  The basis for granting equitable\r\n  relief is the impracticability of obtaining full and adequate compensation at\r\n  law.Â  Monteith v. Harby, 190 S.C. 453, __, 3 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1939).Â \r\n  Accordingly, equity is generally only available when a party is without an\r\n  adequate remedy at law.Â  EllisDon Constr., Inc. v. Clemson Univ., 391\r\n  S.C. 552, 555, 707 S.E.2d 399, 401 (2011).Â  &quot;[E]quity will not impose an\r\n  equitable lien where there is an adequate remedy at law.&quot;Â  Carolina\r\n    Attractions, Inc. v. Courtney, 287 S.C. 140, 146, 337 S.E.2d 244, 247 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1985).Â  &quot;An 'adequate' remedy at law is one which is as certain,\r\n  practical, complete and efficient to attain the ends of justice and its\r\n  administration as the remedy in equity.&quot;Â  Milliken &amp; Co. v. Morin,\r\n  386 S.C. 1, 8, 685 S.E.2d 828, 832 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted).[3]\r\nFirst,\r\n  we find a remedy at law was available because there was a contractual agreement\r\n  between the parties.Â  There is evidence to support the trial court's finding\r\n  that there was a meeting of the minds as to the terms and conditions of the\r\n  parties' original agreement.Â  See Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C.\r\n  101, 106, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989) (holding that for there to be a valid and\r\n  enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties\r\n  with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement).Â  The record\r\n  contains evidence that the parties both orally and expressly agreed Howell Road\r\n  would pay the Nutt Corporation six percent of construction costs as\r\n  consideration for the engineering services related to the Property.Â  See Clardy v. Bodolosky, 383 S.C. 418, 425, 679 S.E.2d 527, 530 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) (&quot;The necessary elements for a contract are an offer, acceptance,\r\n  and valuable consideration.&quot;). Â Furthermore, in its amended complaint, the\r\n  Nutt Corporation specifically references the November 19, 2001 letter as a contract\r\n  entered into for good and valuable consideration.Â  See Verenes v.\r\n    Alvanos, 387 S.C. 11, 16, 690 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2010) (&quot;Characterization\r\n  of an action as equitable or legal depends on the appellant's 'main purpose' in\r\n  bringing the action.Â  The main purpose of the action should generally be\r\n  ascertained from the body of the complaint.&quot; (internal quotations\r\n  omitted)).Â  Therefore, an action at law was available from which the Nutt\r\n  Corporation could have sought to recover contractual damages.Â  See Ahrens\r\n    v. State, 392 S.C. 340, 347-48, 709 S.E.2d 54, 58 (2011) (&quot;An action\r\n  seeking damages for breach of contract is an action at law.&quot;).\r\nWe\r\n  also find contractual damages provided the Nutt Corporation an adequate legal\r\n  remedy.Â  The trial court found the invoiced amount of $34,398.00 was a\r\n  reasonable amount of compensation for the engineering services rendered, and we\r\n  see no reason why a judgment for this\r\n  amount would have provided a remedy any less certain, practical, complete, or\r\n  efficient as an equitable lien.Â  We also note that the possibility the statute\r\n  of limitations may have potentially barred the Nutt Corporation from obtaining\r\n  a legal remedy is no ground in itself for allowing the Nutt Corporation to seek\r\n  equitable relief.Â  See Stewart v. Seigle, 274 P.2d 395, 397-98\r\n  (Okl. 1954) (finding no basis existed to exercise the equitable power of the court\r\n  where the plaintiff failed to exercise his statutory remedy within the time\r\n  prescribed by the statute of limitations); U.S. v. Cent. Livestock Corp.,\r\n  616 F. Supp. 629, 633 (D. Kan. 1985) (holding equity will not intervene if it\r\n  appears the absence of a remedy at law is due to the plaintiff's failure to\r\n  pursue that remedy); Witmer v. Exxon Corp., 394 A.2d 1276, 1286 (Pa.\r\n  Super. Ct. 1978) (holding it is not proper to seek equitable relief where no\r\n  pursuit has been made of available contractual remedies because equity aids the\r\n  vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights); McKittrick v. Bates,\r\n  132 A. 610, 612 (R.I. 1926) (&quot;When one who has a clear method of fully\r\n  determining his rights at law voluntarily adopts improper procedure, or pursues\r\n  proper procedure negligently or mistakenly, without any inducement from one\r\n  having adversary interests, it is no function of equity to relieve him from the\r\n  result of his erroneously conducted lawsuit.&quot;).Â  For these reasons, we find an adequate remedy at law\r\n  was available, and therefore, the trial court erred in granting the Nutt\r\n  Corporation an equitable lien on the Property.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is hereby\r\nREVERSED.\r\n HUFF\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to the testimony of the Nutt Corporation's\r\n  sole shareholder Frank Nutt, after an\r\n  owner decides on a preliminary layout, the development of a parcel of land is\r\n  comprised of the following three distinct phases:Â  (1) roads and storm water\r\n  plan; (2) sewer plan; and (3) water plan.\r\n[2] Howell Road later withdrew its counterclaim for\r\n  sanctions under Rule 11.\r\n[3] Similar to a constructive trust, an equitable lien is\r\n  a special restitutionary remedy that may supplement the law.Â  We can envision\r\n  certain situations where these special restitutionary remedies, arguably,\r\n  should not turn solely on the inadequacy of a legal remedy, especially where\r\n  real estate or trust assets are involved.Â  Equity should always act on a case\r\n  by case basis.Â  The Restatement (Third) of Restitution &amp; Unjust Enrichment\r\n  Â§ 4 (2011), provides &quot;[a]lthough some remedies in restitution are indeed\r\n  equitable in origin, there is no requirement that a claimant who seeks any of\r\n  the remedies [in restitution] must first demonstrate the inadequacy of a remedy\r\n  at law.&quot; Â Â However, this proposition has not been adopted by most, if any,\r\n  states based on our research.Â  See In re Light Cigarettes Mktg. Sales\r\n    Practices Litig., 751 F. Supp.2d 183, 190 n.8 (D. Me. 2010) (analyzing the Restatement\r\n  (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment Â§ 4 (Tentative Draft No. 7, 2010)).Â \r\n  Notwithstanding, those potential scenarios are not present in this case and we\r\n  find it appropriate here to decline equitable relief in the face of an adequate\r\n  remedy at law.\r\n[4] In light of our disposition herein, we decline to\r\n  address Howell Road's remaining arguments, as they are not necessary to the\r\n  decision of this appeal.Â  See Rule 220(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4912","title":"State v.

Winkler, 388 S.C. 574, 582, 698 S.E.2d 596,\r\n  600 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nI. Subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d)\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the trial court erred in holding the State failed to comply with\r\n  subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) because the statute does not require the videotape\r\n  to include a twenty-minute waiting period when a suspect refuses to take a\r\n  breath test.[3]Â \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nUnder our principles of statutory\r\n  construction, the court must &quot;look to the plain language of the statute&quot;\r\n  to determine its meaning.Â  State v. Branham, 392 S.C. 225, 231, 708\r\n  S.E.2d 806, 810 (Ct. App. 2011).Â  &quot;A statute as a whole must receive a\r\n  practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose,\r\n  design, and policy of the lawmakers.&quot;Â  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010)\r\n  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).Â  &quot;Courts will reject a statutory interpretation which would\r\n  lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the\r\n  Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.&quot;Â  Id. at 351, 688 S.E.2d at 575.Â  \r\n&quot;Our appellate courts have strictly construed section 56-5-2953 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Town of Mount Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C.\r\n  332, 346, 713 S.E.2d 278, 285 (2011).Â  Pursuant to that statute, a person arrested for DUI &quot;must have his conduct\r\n  at .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the breath test site videotaped.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  &quot;The\r\n  videotaping at the breath site .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must include the person taking\r\n  or refusing the breath test .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  for the provision in issue, subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) says the videotape must include a suspect's conduct &quot;during the required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) (Supp. 2007) (emphases added).Â  The use of these two modifiers, &quot;required&quot;\r\n  and &quot;pre-test,&quot; limits the application of the subsection.Â  First, the\r\n  use of &quot;pre-test&quot; indicates the entire waiting period must precede a\r\n  breath test.Â  Second, the use of &quot;required&quot; indicates the waiting\r\n  period must be videotaped only if the waiting period itself is required.Â \r\n  Whether the waiting period is required can be traced to two implied consent\r\n  cases.\r\nIn State v. Parker, 271 S.C. 159, 245 S.E.2d 904 (1978), our\r\n  supreme court fashioned a four-part test for laying a breath test foundation:\r\n\r\n  Prior to admitting such evidence, the\r\n    State may be required to prove (1) that the machine was in proper working order\r\n    at the time of the test; (2) that the correct chemicals had been used; (3) that\r\n    the accused was not allowed to put anything in his mouth for 20 minutes prior\r\n    to the test[;] and (4) that the test was\r\n    administered by a qualified person in the proper manner.\r\n\r\nId. at 163,\r\n  245 S.E.2d at 906.Â  In State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 408 S.E.2d 235\r\n  (1991), the court held the State need not\r\n  comply with the waiting period requirement in implied consent cases when a\r\n  suspect refuses to take a breath test.Â  Id. at 322, 408 S.E.2d at 237.Â  The court reasoned, &quot;[T]he Parker precautions are intended to ensure that the results of the breathalyzer test if\r\n  given are accurate and reliable as evidence at trial,&quot; and the precautions\r\n  are pointless when the test is not given.Â  Id.\r\nAlthough Parker and Jansen involved the\r\n  implied consent statute, no provisions in subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) other\r\n  than the waiting period provision are modified by the term &quot;required.&quot;\r\n  Â Further, subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) was promulgated in 1998 and written\r\n  with the implied consent statute in mind.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 1997) (&quot;The arresting officer may not administer the\r\n  [breath, blood, or urine] tests.&quot;), amended by S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 1998) (&quot;The arresting officer may administer the [breath]\r\n  test[] if the person's conduct during the twenty-minute pre-test waiting period\r\n  is videotaped pursuant to [subs]ection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d).&quot;).Â  Thus, we\r\n  believe subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d)'s phrase &quot;required twenty-minute\r\n  pre-test waiting period&quot; is a direct reference to Parker and Jansen.[4]Â \r\n  When the breath test is refused, the twenty-minute\r\n  waiting period is not required and, therefore, need not be videotaped.[5]\r\nThis reading of the statute is consistent with the legislature's\r\n  intent.Â  Generally, &quot;[t]he legislature is\r\n  presumed to intend that its statutes accomplish something.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Long, 363 S.C. 360, 364, 610 S.E.2d 809, 811 (2005).Â  Here, the primary\r\n  intention behind section 56-5-2953 was to reduce the number of DUI trials heard\r\n  as swearing contests by mandating the State videotape important events in the\r\n  process of collecting DUI evidence.[6]Â \r\n  As it relates to the waiting period, the statute ensures the attempt to\r\n  establish the breath test's reliability need not endure such swearing\r\n  contests.Â  If a breath test is administered, the waiting period's videotaping\r\n  provides evidence that helps resolve credibility disputes as to the procedure\r\n  used in administering the breath test.Â  Cf. Jansen, 305 S.C. at\r\n  322, 408 S.E.2d at 237 (&quot;[T]he Parker precautions are intended to insure that the results of the breathalyzer\r\n  test if given are accurate and reliable as evidence at trial.&quot;).Â  If the\r\n  breath test is not administered, none of those credibility disputes will arise.\r\nThe statute must be interpreted with realistic\r\n  circumstances and rationales in mind, and this interpretation follows that\r\n  approach.Â  See State v. Baker, 310 S.C. 510, 512, 427 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1993) (&quot;A\r\n  statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair\r\n  interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the\r\n  lawmakers.&quot;).Â  Our interpretation does not require a police officer\r\n  to turn off the video recorder after the person refuses to take the test, nor\r\n  does it frustrate the statute's general requirement\r\n  that a person arrested for DUI &quot;have his conduct at .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the\r\n  breath test site videotaped.&quot;Â  Â§ 56-5-2953(A).Â  In all cases, the videotape must still include the person\r\n  being informed he is being videotaped, being informed he may refuse the test,\r\n  and refusing the breath test if he in fact does so.[7]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(b)-(c)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  Accordingly, if a person\r\n  refuses to take the breath test, dismissal of a DUI charge is not warranted for\r\n  the failure to videotape the person's conduct for twenty minutes so long as the\r\n  other requirements of subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2) are satisfied. The trial court\r\n  erred in dismissing Elwell's DUI charge.\r\nII. Subsection\r\n  56-5-2953(B)\r\nAs\r\n  an alternative to its first argument, the State contends Elwell's refusal to\r\n  consent to the breath test was a &quot;valid reason&quot; to stop videotaping\r\n  the waiting period under subsection 56-5-2953(B). Â However, because we reverse\r\n  on the above issue, we need not address this issue.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues when a\r\n  decision on a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, we reverse the trial\r\n  court's dismissal of the DUI charge against Elwell and remand for trial. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] An amended videotape statute became effective after\r\n  Elwell's arrest.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953 (Supp. 2010) (effective\r\n  February 10, 2009).\r\n[2] Miranda\r\n  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3] During oral argument, the State sought to supplement\r\n  the record with a DVD of the breath test to prove Elwell was videotaped for\r\n  twenty minutes.&nbsp; Defense counsel objected.&nbsp; This court did not rule\r\n  on the motion, and the State did not follow-up with a written motion.Â  In any\r\n  event, both parties agreed during oral argument that the court could access an\r\n  online version of the video using information properly included in the record.Â \r\n  The record included an internet link, username, and password to access the video,\r\n  and the court has reviewed the online video.Â  However, whether the videotape in\r\n  fact depicts the entire waiting period is unpreserved.Â  The State did not\r\n  contest that issue before the trial court, and its oral argument before this\r\n  court was the first time the issue was raised.Â  See State v. Carmack, 388 S.C. 190, 200, 694\r\n  S.E.2d 224, 229 (Ct. App. 2010) (&quot;[F]or\r\n  an issue to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial judge.&quot;).\r\n[4] Our conclusion that the above phrase refers to the\r\n  parameters established by Parker and Jansen is also supported by\r\n  considering the effect of omitting the term &quot;required&quot; from the\r\n  statute.Â  If the statute did not include &quot;required,&quot; it would provide\r\n  as follows: &quot;The videotaping at the breath\r\n  site&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must also include the person's conduct during\r\n  the twenty-minute pre-test waiting period.&quot;Â  Under such a version of the\r\n  statute, the &quot;must also include&quot; language would itself mandate the\r\n  waiting period be videotaped, and the term &quot;required&quot; would be\r\n  unnecessary.Â  We will not interpret the statute to include such a redundancy.Â  See Sweat, 386 S.C. at 351, 688 S.E.2d at 575 (&quot;A statute should be so\r\n  construed that no word, clause, sentence, provision or part shall be rendered\r\n  surplusage, or superfluous.&quot; (citation and internal question marks\r\n  omitted)).\r\n[5] As a whole, subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) provides the following:\r\n\r\n  The videotaping at\r\n    the breath site .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must also include the person's conduct during\r\n    the required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period, unless the officer submits\r\n    a sworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to videotape\r\n    this waiting period.Â  However, if the arresting officer administers the breath\r\n    test, the person's conduct during the twenty-minute pre-test waiting period\r\n    must be videotaped.\r\n\r\nThe subsection establishes when\r\n  the waiting period must be videotaped, and it limits when an affidavit may be\r\n  introduced in lieu of the videotape.Â  If the waiting period's videotaping was required\r\n  but was physically impossible, an affidavit to that effect may be introduced.Â \r\n  However, the affidavit may not be introduced in lieu of a videotape if the\r\n  arresting officer administered the breath test.Â  The current version of\r\n  subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2) does not preclude the arresting officer from using\r\n  the affidavit when the arresting officer administered the breath test.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;The video recording at\r\n  the breath test site must .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;also include the person's conduct during the required twenty-minute\r\n  pre-test waiting period, unless the officer submits a sworn affidavit\r\n  certifying that it was physically impossible to video record this waiting\r\n  period.&quot;).\r\n[6] The introductory sentence of subsection 56-5-2953(A)\r\n  frames the rest of the subsection's provisions, stating &quot;[a] person [arrested for DUI] must have his conduct at the\r\n  incident site and the breath test site videotaped.&quot;Â  Â§\r\n  56-5-2953(A).Â  The statute protects both the State\r\n  and the defendant from sometimes unreliable memories of those testifying during\r\n  trial.Â  \r\n[7] The amended version of subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2) removes\r\n  the requirement that the videotape include the reading of Miranda rights.Â  Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2) (Supp. 2007), with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2) (Supp. 2010).Â  However, that alteration does\r\n  not affect our interpretation of the statute's waiting period videotape\r\n  requirement.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4913","title":"In the Interest of Jamal G.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4913","description":"In this appeal from the family court involving a juvenile criminal matter, Jamal G. contends the family court erred in failing to reduce the charge of murder to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter.

(Jamal), Terrell W.,[1] and\r\n  Jamal's brother (Michael) were outside a neighborhood convenience store.Â \r\n  Around the same time, Trammel (Victim), Victim's younger brother (Telvin), and\r\n  their uncle (Troy), were standing in a yard a few houses away from the store.Â  \r\nKim,\r\n  one of the state's witnesses, testified to an ongoing dispute between Telvin\r\n  and Terrell's brother (Timmy).Â  Jamal called Telvin a derogatory name in front\r\n  of Kim and a few other witnesses, and then asked Brittany Lesston if she would\r\n  call Telvin to the store.Â  Kim stated Jamal and Terrell indicated they were\r\n  going to take care of &quot;Timmy's business.&quot;Â  Kim said she interpreted\r\n  one of Jamal's statements to mean Jamal and Terrell could beat Telvin in a\r\n  fight one on one.Â  Kim then walked over to Victim, Telvin, and Troy and told\r\n  them to ignore Jamal and Terrell.Â  However, Victim stated he was going to\r\n  &quot;squash this right now.&quot;Â  Kim said Victim went to Terrell trying to\r\n  be a peacemaker, but Terrell became agitated, at which point Telvin ran over\r\n  and started fighting with Terrell.Â  Kim heard Jamal tell Terrell to\r\n  &quot;chill,&quot; but Terrell took a gun from Jamal's person and fired it\r\n  once.Â  Subsequently, Kim saw Jamal get the gun back from Terrell, and she watched\r\n  Jamal shoot the gun multiple times.Â  Kim stated she then saw the victim\r\n  collapse, but she did not know who fired the shot that hit Victim.Â  During\r\n  cross-examination Kim testified the victim did not attempt to break up the\r\n  fight between Telvin and Terrell, he was observing.Â  \r\nBrittany\r\n  Lesston confirmed that Jamal asked her to call and ask Telvin to come to the\r\n  corner store, however, she refused Jamal's request.Â  Brittany also testified\r\n  that Telvin and Terrell fought, and she heard Terrell yell, &quot;Give me the\r\n  f-ing gun.&quot;Â  Brittany states there was a &quot;scuffle&quot; between\r\n  Victim, Telvin, Jamal, Terrell, and three other men when she heard one shot,\r\n  then multiple shots after that.Â  \r\n Condenia\r\n  Lesston testified Terrell yelled expletives at Telvin for not coming out of his\r\n  yard to fight.Â  At that point, Victim &quot;calmly&quot; walked out to speak\r\n  with Terrell.Â  She observed Terrell become agitated with Victim, and then\r\n  Telvin came out and began fighting Terrell.Â  Condenia claims Terrell shot\r\n  Victim while Victim was trying to break up the fight between Terrell and\r\n  Telvin.Â  Furthermore, Condenia stated Telvin took a gun out of Victim's holster\r\n  after Victim was shot.Â  On cross-examination, Condenia testified that Jamal\r\n  told Terrell to calm things down, but that is when Terrell took the gun from\r\n  Jamal's back pocket and shot it at Victim.Â  She stated she saw Jamal grab the\r\n  gun back from Terrell and shoot towards Victim as well.Â  \r\nTroy\r\n  observed a fight between Terrell, Jamal, Michael, and Telvin.Â  Troy also testified\r\n  that he saw Terrell with the gun, and Terrell fired the gun once in the\r\n  victim's direction.Â  After that shot, Troy stated the victim slumped over while\r\n  slightly backing up, and Jamal began firing a gun, although he was not sure\r\n  where Jamal got the gun.Â  \r\nCarlos\r\n  Jenkins, Sr. stated he saw Michael pulling Telvin off Terrell and Victim hit\r\n  Michael in the back of the head with a gun.Â  When the gun struck Michael,\r\n  Jenkins testified the gun unloaded.Â  Jenkins began running and could not see\r\n  anything, but he heard more shots fired.Â  Jenkins then said he turned back\r\n  around and saw a man he did not know firing a gun, but did not see anyone get\r\n  shot.Â  Jenkins also stated he never saw Jamal or Terrell with a gun.Â Â Â  \r\nJamal\r\n  B., Jenkins' cousin, testified that while walking with Jenkins, he saw Michael\r\n  try to intervene in a fight between Telvin and Terrell.Â  Jamal B. stated he saw\r\n  Victim pull out his gun and chop Michael in the back of the head with it, at\r\n  which point the gun fired.Â  Jamal B. then indicated he also saw another\r\n  unidentified male firing a gun, but did not see the victim get shot.Â  Jamal B.\r\n  stated he did not see Terrell or Jamal fire a gun.Â  \r\nDetective\r\n  Allen Kramitz arrived at the scene after the shooting and blamed the many\r\n  conflicting accounts on there being &quot;so many people and so much going\r\n  on.&quot;Â  Seven .380 millimeter casings, one .9 millimeter casing, and eight\r\n  projectiles were found at the scene, in addition to one projectile discovered\r\n  during the autopsy of Victim.Â  Kramitz stated it was &quot;highly unlikely that\r\n  the same person discharged both the .9 millimeter and the .380.&quot;Â  The\r\n  projectile recovered from the victim's autopsy was consistent with a .380\r\n  automatic weapon, fired by the same gun as the .380 projectiles recovered from\r\n  the scene.Â  Victim's 9 millimeter handgun, which was given to the police by\r\n  Victim's family, fired one of the projectiles recovered from the scene.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  listening to all the evidence, the family court found the State's witnesses to\r\n  be credible.Â  The family court found the defense witnesses credible, to a\r\n  certain extent, but did not find the testimony regarding the unknown,\r\n  unidentified man believable.Â  Furthermore, the court found as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  What occurred on\r\n    this particular evening was two young men came to this location armed with a\r\n    weapon.Â  They came seeking a confrontation, and they got it.Â  There was no\r\n    testimony that [victim] approached these young men in any sort of aggressive or\r\n    hostile manner, although, he carried a weapon as well.Â  What ensued from that is\r\n    a fight that I [the family court judge] believe was being provoked and promoted\r\n    by these two young men.Â  [The victim's] brother decided that he was going to\r\n    join in, and that was the match that lit the fire.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  family court then ruled as follows about voluntary manslaughter being a\r\n  consideration in this case:\r\n\r\n  The largest\r\n    question with which I've had to grapple is whether the gun discharging - - the\r\n    gun used by [the victim] discharging was sufficient provocation to reduce this\r\n    from murder to manslaughter.Â  After a great deal of deliberation and\r\n    consideration on this issue, I do not find it to be sufficient provocation.Â  I\r\n    believe the discharge was accidental.Â  Although the gun was being used as a\r\n    weapon, it was not being used as a firearm.\r\n  In return these\r\n    two young men used a gun with malice with the intent to inflict serious injury\r\n    or death.Â  And no matter how sufficient the provocation, it cannot overcome\r\n    their intent to inflict this serious injury or death.Â  Therefore, I do find\r\n    these defendants to be delinquent on the charge of murder.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  family court found Jamal delinquent on the charge of murder, unlawful\r\n  possession of a handgun by a minor, unlawful possession of a handgun, and\r\n  discharging or use of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â \r\n  Jamal was sentenced to the Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period\r\n  not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot; Â State\r\n    v. Rios, 388 S.C. 335, 337, 696 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing State\r\n      v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006)).Â  &quot;Thus, this\r\n  court is bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.&quot;Â  Id. (citing Baccus, 367 S.C. at 48, 625 S.E.2d\r\n  at 220).Â  &quot;'On review, this [c]ourt is limited to determining whether the\r\n  circuit court abused its discretion.'&quot;Â  Id. at 338, 696 S.E.2d at\r\n  610 (quoting State v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 158, 682 S.E.2d 19, 26 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009)).Â  &quot;This [c]ourt does not reevaluate the facts based on its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the\r\n  circuit court's ruling is supported by any evidence.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Simmons, 384 S.C. at 158, 682 S.E.2d at 26).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;Voluntary\r\nmanslaughter\r\nJamal\r\n  argues the family court erred in finding &quot;no matter how sufficient the\r\n  provocation&quot; was to reduce the crime from murder to voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, Jamal's intent to inflict serious injury or death made the crime\r\n  murder.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  an issue must be both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C.\r\n  138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003).Â  Arguments raised for the first time\r\n  on appeal are not preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Jones,\r\n  392 S.C. 647, 655, 709 S.E.2d 696, 700 (Ct. App. 2011).Â  &quot;Although this\r\n  court has advocated excepting juvenile criminal matters from the strict rules\r\n  of issue preservation, [our] supreme court has declined to address whether such\r\n  an exception should be recognized.&quot;Â  In re Walter M., 386 S.C. 387,\r\n  392, 688 S.E.2d 133, 136 (Ct.Â  App. 2009); see In\r\n    re Arisha K.S., 331 S.C. 288, 296, 501 S.E.2d 128, 133 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (inviting the supreme court to address the setting aside of the rules of issue\r\n  preservation in the context of juvenile criminal matters).Â  Thus, this court\r\n  remains bound by this state's long-standing rules of issue preservation.Â  See In re Walter M.,&nbsp;386 S.C. at 392-93, 688 S.E.2d at 136.\r\nJamal\r\n  did not raise an objection to the court's consideration and ultimate rejection of\r\n  the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter during the reading of the\r\n  verdict.Â  Furthermore, Jamal did not make a post-trial motion requesting\r\n  reconsideration of the denial to charge voluntary manslaughter.Â  While the\r\n  trial court may have made contradictory remarks and stated an improper standard\r\n  for voluntary manslaughter, Jamal should have objected to those statements.Â \r\n  Without an objection, the trial court had no opportunity to clarify its\r\n  decision, and the issue is not appropriately preserved.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the issue of reconsideration of the denial of a charge of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter not preserved for appellate review; thus, we affirm the family\r\n  court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  upon the foregoing reasons, the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Terrell was charged as a co-defendant in this case.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4914","title":"Stevens & Wilkinson v.

Â When the City gave the project to another team\r\n  approximately one year later, some members of the original development team\r\n  filed suit against the City for breach of the MOU and other causes of action.Â \r\n  The City made a motion for summary judgment contending the MOU is not a\r\n  contract, and the circuit court granted the motion.Â  We find the circuit court\r\n  erred in ruling as a matter of law that the MOU is not a contract.[1]Â \r\n  We reverse and remand for trial.Â  We also reverse summary judgment on a quantum\r\n  meruit claim.Â  We affirm summary judgment on a promissory estoppel claim.\r\nI.  Facts\r\nIn January 2001, the City sought\r\n  requests for qualifications to develop, build, and operate a hotel near the\r\n  Convention Center.Â  In December 2002, City Council selected a team to develop\r\n  the hotel.Â  The team chosen consisted of three developers, Garfield Traub\r\n  Development, Gary Realty Company, and Edens &amp; Avant Real Estate Services; architecture\r\n  firm Stevens &amp; Wilkinson; Turner Construction Company; Hilton Hotels Corporation;\r\n  and bond underwriter Salomon Smith Barney.Â  The team proposed a 300-room,\r\n  full-service Hilton Hotel.Â  It planned to publicly finance the hotel using\r\n  bonds that would be paid with hotel revenue, subsidized by the City if necessary.\r\nAfter choosing the development team,\r\n  the City hired a consulting company to negotiate and draft the MOU.Â  In April\r\n  2003, the City and the team signed the MOU.Â  The MOU begins by reciting the\r\n  following language: &quot;[I]n consideration of the foregoing and the mutual\r\n  promises contained herein, and other valuable consideration the sufficiency and\r\n  receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows.&quot;Â  The\r\n  MOU called on the team members and the City to perform various tasks.Â  It\r\n  provided the City would purchase and prepare land for the hotel site, form a\r\n  non-profit corporation to own the land, and issue &quot;approximately $60\r\n  million&quot; in hotel revenue bonds. Â Meanwhile, the development team was to complete\r\n  certain work, such as plans, drawings, and financial models, that would enable\r\n  Turner Construction to calculate a guaranteed maximum price for the hotel\r\n  construction.Â  \r\nThe MOU also required the parties\r\n  to negotiate numerous agreements over the course of developing the hotel.Â  The\r\n  MOU recited some of the basic elements these future agreements would contain.Â  These\r\n  written agreements were to be executed at the bond closing.Â  The bonds were set\r\n  to close on October 13, 2003.Â  If the bonds failed to close &quot;as a result\r\n  of the City not meeting its obligations outlined in the Development Agreement,\r\n  or as a result of an unforeseen catastrophic event not caused by any of the [] [t]eam,\r\n  the City [would] reimburse the [] [t]eam for actual, documented costs.&quot;Â \r\n  However, the MOU also stated that &quot;[n]otwithstanding anything herein to\r\n  the contrary, if the City determines that it is not feasible to proceed with the\r\n  Hotel project it shall have no liability under this MOU.&quot;\r\nThe City and the development team performed\r\n  in accordance with the MOU for over a year.Â  In June 2003, the City filed\r\n  articles of incorporation for the Columbia Convention Center Hotel Corporation.Â \r\n  By July 2003, Stevens &amp; Wilkinson completed the architectural plans\r\n  necessary for bond closing.Â  At this point, Stevens &amp; Wilkinson had performed\r\n  architectural work valued at approximately $1.2 million.Â  \r\nThe bonds did not close in October\r\n  2003 as planned.Â  By February 2004, the non-profit corporation's board of directors and the development team set April\r\n  1, 2004, as the new date for the bond closing.Â  At the same time, the board\r\n  approved an increased total project cost of over $71 million, and Ambac\r\n  Assurance issued a Commitment for Financial Guaranty Insurance for over $63\r\n  million in bonds to the City.\r\nDuring this time the Windsor/Aughtry\r\n  Company expressed to City Council its desire to build a privately funded hotel\r\n  instead of the development team's publicly funded hotel.Â  In March 2004, City\r\n  Council voted to issue a second request for proposals for the hotel.Â  By that\r\n  time, the cost of the development team's plan had risen to over $72 million.Â  The\r\n  City never determined whether the team's plan was feasible and never directed the\r\n  team to stop its work on the project.Â  \r\nIn response to the City's new request\r\n  for proposals, the development team submitted two proposals for Hilton Hotels.[2]Â \r\n  One was a resubmission of its original publicly financed proposal.Â  The other\r\n  was a new proposal for the hotel to be partially funded by the City and partially\r\n  privately funded.Â  Windsor/Aughtry submitted a proposal for a privately funded\r\n  hotel with an estimated cost of $26 million.Â  Its proposal allowed the City a\r\n  choice of a Hilton Garden Inn or a Marriot Courtyard.Â  Later, at the City's\r\n  request, Windsor/Aughtry offered to build a Hilton Hotel if the City paid an\r\n  additional $3 million.Â  The City chose Windsor/Aughtry's proposal. \r\nII.&nbsp; Procedural History\r\nStevens &amp; Wilkinson, Garfield\r\n  Traub, and Gary Realty brought suit against the City alleging breach of\r\n  contract based on the MOU.Â  Stevens &amp; Wilkinson also brought a cause of\r\n  action for promissory estoppel.Â  Garfield Traub and Gary Realty also sought\r\n  recovery based on quantum meruit.Â  The City filed motions for summary judgment\r\n  as to all three causes of action.Â  In a consolidated order, the circuit court\r\n  granted the City's motions.Â  The court determined there was no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to the existence of a contract, making the issue a matter of\r\n  law for the court to decide.Â  The court found the MOU was not a contract\r\n  because it stated the parties' intention to proceed in good faith toward\r\n  executing definitive agreements that would bind the parties.Â  The court also\r\n  found the parties did not agree on material terms and the MOU did not resolve\r\n  disputed issues, such as executive compensation and whether the hotel would pay\r\n  property taxes.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Whether the Circuit Court Erred in Ruling as a Matter of Law That\r\n  the MOU is Not a Contract\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate\r\n  only if &quot;there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the\r\n  moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  When there is conflicting evidence on some material issue, the court\r\n  may not grant summary judgment.Â  See Shirley's Iron Works, Inc. v.\r\n    City of Union, 387 S.C. 389, 397, 693 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 2010) (&quot;At\r\n  the summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not weigh conflicting\r\n  evidence with respect to a disputed material fact.&quot; (internal quotation\r\n  marks omitted)).Â  &quot;If the evidence as to the existence of a contract is\r\n  conflicting or raises more than one reasonable inference, the issue should be\r\n  submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 223,\r\n  621 S.E.2d 368, 377 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Small v. Springs Indus.,\r\n    Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 483, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454 (1987) (same).Â  Viewing the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we find disputed facts that\r\n  permit more than one inference as to whether the parties intended the MOU to be\r\n  a contract.Â  \r\nTo explain that evidence exists to\r\n  support the plaintiffs' claim that the parties intended the MOU to be a\r\n  contract, we consider the plaintiffs' theory of the case. Â Their theory begins\r\n  with the premise that the City needed significant work done before it could\r\n  determine whether financing, building, and operating the hotel was feasible.Â  The\r\n  plaintiffs argue the MOU contains a mutual exchange of promises between the\r\n  City and the team members to perform the various tasks necessary for the City\r\n  to eventually make this determination of feasibility.Â  Under this theory,\r\n  Stevens &amp; Wilkinson, Garfield Traub, and Gary Realty agreed to perform the\r\n  work allocated to each of them in the MOU in exchange for the promises made by\r\n  the other parties, particularly the City.Â  The plaintiffs argue these promises\r\n  include the City's promise to actually make the determination of feasibility, and\r\n  to do so in good faith.\r\nThe MOU provides evidence supporting\r\n  this theory.Â  For example, the City needed detailed architectural plans from\r\n  Stevens &amp; Wilkinson and a guaranteed maximum price from Turner Construction\r\n  before it could submit the hotel plan to a bond underwriter.Â  The MOU contains Stevens\r\n  &amp; Wilkinson's promise to prepare the architectural plans.Â  Stevens &amp;\r\n  Wilkinson contends it made that promise in exchange for, or in consideration\r\n  of, the City's various promises, including its promise to acquire and prepare the\r\n  land for the hotel site.Â  The MOU also contains promises made by Garfield Traub\r\n  and Gary Realty, supporting the plaintiffs' theory that all the promises were given\r\n  as consideration for each other.Â  See Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth.,\r\n  354 S.C. 397, 405, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003) (&quot;A bilateral contract . . .\r\n  exists when both parties exchange mutual promises.&quot;).\r\nThe MOU contains other promises the\r\n  plaintiffs argue were made in consideration of each other, including the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  The City promised to reimburse the development team's expenses\r\n  out of &quot;Hotel Revenue Bond proceeds&quot; in exchange for the team's\r\n  promise to expend substantial effort to design a feasible hotel.Â \r\n  \r\n  The developers promised to &quot;coordinate design . . . of the\r\n  Hotel&quot; prior to the execution of any other contracts in exchange for the\r\n  right to do the development work on the hotel and the promise of a fee of 4.75%\r\n  of the project budget.\r\n  \r\n  Stevens &amp; Wilkinson promised to prepare hotel plans in\r\n  exchange for the right to complete the architectural work on the hotel and the\r\n  promise of a fee of 7.25% of the &quot;hard construction costs&quot; and Turner Construction's &quot;general expenses and\r\n  fees.&quot;\r\n  \r\n  Hilton promised to &quot;contribute $1.5 million in the form of\r\n  [a] . . . loan&quot; in exchange for the right to operate the hotel for fifteen\r\n  years under a Qualified Management Agreement.Â \r\n\r\nBased on the existence of these promises in the MOU, it is\r\n  reasonable to infer that the plaintiffs would not have agreed to do their work\r\n  unless the City made these promises, and that the City made the promises in\r\n  order to induce the plaintiffs to perform the work.Â  \r\nThere is other evidence to support\r\n  the plaintiffs' claim that the MOU is a contract.Â  First, the parties chose to\r\n  use the classic contract language &quot;in consideration of the foregoing and\r\n  the mutual promises contained herein, and other valuable consideration the\r\n  sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as\r\n  follows.&quot;Â  The MOU also contains provisions excluding liability for\r\n  certain actions.Â  For example, the MOU states, &quot;[I]f the City determines\r\n  that it is not feasible to proceed with the Hotel project it shall have no\r\n  liability under this MOU.&quot;Â  The exclusion of liability under one\r\n  circumstance is some evidence the parties intended there to be liability under\r\n  the MOU in other circumstances.Â  Additionally, Garfield Traub submitted\r\n  affidavits from three of its employees stating they intended the MOU to be a\r\n  contract and &quot;never would have agreed to put in the effort necessary to\r\n  develop the Hotel if [they] did not consider the MOU to form a contract.&quot;Â \r\n  Thus, the evidence permits the reasonable inference that the parties entered\r\n  the MOU with the intent to create a contract.Â  \r\nThere is also evidence to support the\r\n  City's theory that the MOU is not a contract, but instead was merely a nonbinding\r\n  framework for the development stage of the project.Â  This theory is based on\r\n  the premise that the parties would be bound in the future by the written\r\n  agreements contemplated by the MOU, not by the MOU itself.Â  The MOU also\r\n  supports this theory, as it refers to numerous agreements that were to be\r\n  negotiated after the parties signed the MOU.Â  For example, the Qualified\r\n  Management Agreement mentioned in the MOU needed to be executed before the\r\n  bonds could close, and the Design-Build Agreement was to include the agreed-upon\r\n  construction costs, which would ultimately determine the amount each member of\r\n  the development team would be paid.\r\nThe City cites various cases to\r\n  support its claim that the MOU is not a contract because it contemplated future\r\n  agreements.Â  At oral argument, however, the City conceded that a preliminary\r\n  agreement that contemplates a future agreement could be a contract, depending\r\n  on the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.Â  Here, the plaintiffs\r\n  allege a breach of the MOU, not a breach of a future contract committing them\r\n  to build the hotel.Â  As noted above, there is evidence in the facts and\r\n  circumstances surrounding the MOU that supports a reasonable inference that the\r\n  MOU was a contract.Â  \r\nMoreover, each of the cases the\r\n  City cites is distinguishable from this case because none involves facts and\r\n  circumstances supporting a reasonable inference that the preliminary arrangement\r\n  was a contract.Â  In each case cited by the City, the plaintiff sued for a\r\n  breach of the final contract the parties never reached, not for a breach of a\r\n  preliminary agreement.Â  See Electro-Lab of Aiken, Inc. v. Sharp\r\n    Constr. Co. of Sumter, 357 S.C. 363, 369-70, 593 S.E.2d 170, 173-74 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004) (finding general contractor's use of subcontractor's estimate in\r\n  bid, later request for subcontractor's bond rate, and fax stating subcontract\r\n  was forthcoming did not amount to a contract because these communications\r\n  &quot;were merely preliminary negotiations&quot;); Trident Constr. Co. v.\r\n    Austin Co., 272 F. Supp. 2d 566, 575-76 (D.S.C. 2003) (finding no oral contract\r\n  when the plaintiff alleged the defendant told it if the defendant won the bid\r\n  to build an airplane hangar, it would give the plaintiff the supplier subcontract,\r\n  because the parties never agreed on price); Blanton Enters., Inc. v. Burger\r\n    King Corp., 680 F. Supp. 753, 768-70, 773 (D.S.C. 1988) (finding no oral franchise\r\n  agreement because &quot;the parties intended to be bound only after plaintiff\r\n  had received the requisite written approvals and they had reduced their\r\n  agreement to a signed writing&quot;); Savannah Guano Co. v. Fogle, 112\r\n  S.C. 234, 238, 100 S.E. 59, 60 (1919) (finding no contract for the plaintiff to\r\n  sell the defendant fertilizer and carry his indebtedness forward to the next\r\n  year because the parties had not agreed on quantity, price, delivery, or\r\n  payment); Holliday v. Pegram, 89 S.C. 73, 81-82, 71 S.E. 367, 370 (1911)\r\n  (finding the parties' correspondence concerning the lease of a tobacco\r\n  warehouse did not amount to a contract because the language of the letters was\r\n  provisional).\r\nRather than focusing on whether the\r\n  MOU calls for the parties to reach future agreements, the proper inquiry is to\r\n  determine whether the MOU meets the elements of a contract.Â  Because evidence\r\n  exists to support the plaintiffs' theory that it does since it contains\r\n  mutually binding promises the parties intended to be a contract, we find the\r\n  circuit court erred in holding as a matter of law that the MOU is not a\r\n  contract.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's decision to grant\r\n  summary judgment on the question of whether the MOU is a contract.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Garfield Traub and Gary Realty's\r\n  Quantum Meruit Claim\r\nGarfield\r\n  Traub and Gary Realty argue the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\n  judgment for the City on their quantum meruit cause of action.Â  We agree.\r\nTo\r\n  recover on a claim for quantum meruit, a plaintiff must establish three elements:\r\n  &quot;(1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2)\r\n  realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention by the\r\n  defendant of the benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him to retain\r\n  it without paying its value.&quot;Â  Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich,\r\n  390 S.C. 609, 616-17, 703 S.E.2d 221, 225 (2010).Â  Focusing on the first\r\n  element, the circuit court found the team's plans, drawings, financial models,\r\n  construction estimates, and expertise had no intrinsic value and did not\r\n  benefit the City.Â  Based solely on that element, the circuit court granted\r\n  summary judgment for the City.Â  We do not believe it is possible to rule as a\r\n  matter of law that the alleged benefit to the City had no value.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's decision to grant summary judgment on this element\r\n  of the quantum meruit claim.\r\nV.&nbsp; Stevens &amp; Wilkinson's Promissory Estoppel Claim\r\nFinally, Stevens\r\n  &amp; Wilkinson argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on\r\n  its promissory estoppel cause of action.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  recover for promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must prove the following: (1) a\r\n  party made a promise unambiguous in its terms; (2) the party to whom the\r\n  promise is made reasonably relied on the promise; (3) the reliance was expected\r\n  and foreseeable by the party who made the promise; and (4) the party to whom\r\n  the promise is made sustained injury in reliance on the promise.Â  Woods v.\r\n    State, 314 S.C. 501, 505, 431 S.E.2d 260, 263 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n The promise Stevens &amp;\r\n  Wilkinson argues is unambiguous, and therefore meets the first element of\r\n  promissory estoppel, is in the MOU.&nbsp; Consequently, this court must\r\n  interpret the promise as it appears in the MOU.Â  Because the MOU provides that\r\n  the promise is contingent, it cannot be an unambiguous promise to pay.Â  The\r\n  promise is this statement: &quot;The Architect is to be paid a fee of 7.25% . .\r\n  . based on hard construction costs . . . .&quot;Â  The same paragraph in which\r\n  that statement is made contains a contingency which provides that Stevens &amp;\r\n  Wilkinson would receive its fee only if bond financing closed.Â  Therefore, Stevens\r\n  &amp; Wilkinson bore the risk of non-payment.Â  The MOU also provides that if\r\n  bond financing did not close, Stevens &amp; Wilkinson could recover its\r\n  documented out-of-pocket expenses only if financing fell through due to either\r\n  the City's breach of the Development Agreement, which was never executed, or an\r\n  unforeseen catastrophic event not caused by a member of the team.Â  Even if any\r\n  of these scenarios triggering payment occurred, the City would not be required\r\n  to pay Stevens &amp; Wilkinson if the City determined moving forward with the\r\n  project was infeasible. \r\nTo the\r\n  extent Stevens &amp; Wilkinson claims the promise is unambiguous, it cannot\r\n  deny the clarity of the contingency.Â  It is not possible to read the MOU as\r\n  requiring payment of the fee except on the occurrence of a contingency all parties\r\n  agree never occurred.Â  Therefore, the circuit court correctly found that the\r\n  MOU does not contain an unambiguous promise by the City to pay Stevens &amp;\r\n  Wilkinson.Â  Thus, we affirm the circuit court's decision to grant summary\r\n  judgment on the promissory estoppel claim.Â Â Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nWe reverse the circuit court's\r\n  decision to grant summary judgment for the City on the issue of whether the MOU\r\n  is a contract.Â  We remand for a jury to make that determination.Â  We also\r\n  reverse the circuit court's decision to grant summary judgment as to Garfield\r\n  Traub and Gary Realty's quantum meruit claim.Â  We affirm summary judgment as to\r\n  Stevens &amp; Wilkinson's promissory estoppel claim.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN\r\n  PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This issue is raised in two appeals from the same order.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  consolidate the appeals pursuant to Rule 214, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] Edens &amp; Avant did not take part in the second request for proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
