Pleasant, LLC (Landlord).Â  Since we may affirm for any reason\r\n    in the record, we affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2001, Tenant\r\n  entered into a lease (Lease) with MD/CP-Mount Pleasant, LLC (MD/CP).Â  The Lease\r\n  clause titled â€œDelivery of Possessionâ€ provided Landlord would complete\r\n  construction of the building and deliver exclusive possession to Tenant in\r\n  April 2002, or as soon thereafter as possible, but no later than January 2003.Â \r\n  The Lease was for seventy-five years, but Tenant had the option of terminating\r\n  it early at specified times.Â  The leased premises specifically included â€œthe\r\n  [b]uilding, real estate and other improvements to be constructed thereon . . .\r\n  .â€Â  In August 2004, Landlord was assigned MD/CPâ€™s interest under the Lease.Â \r\n  Tenant was in possession of the property before the filing of a condemnation notice\r\non October 29, 2004.\r\nArticle 4 (Condemnation\r\n  Disclosure) in the Lease stated, â€œLandlord, after due inquiry, warrants and\r\n  represents to Tenant that, other than the condemnation of a strip of land\r\n  approximately five (5) feet wide along Hwy. 21, Landlord has no knowledge of\r\n  any pending or threatened condemnation actions which will affect the Leased Premises.â€[1]Â \r\n  The Lease also contained a site plan depicting an area labeled â€œ20â€™ Future R/W\r\n  Per Townâ€ abutting Highway 17.Â  Additionally, the Lease contained a section on\r\n  condemnation (Condemnation Clause), which was divided into two parts, 32(a) and\r\n32(b).Â  Section 32(a) of the Condemnation Clause provided in part: \r\n\r\n\tIf prior\r\n  to Landlordâ€™s delivery of possession of the Leased Premises to Tenant in\r\n  accordance with Article 4, any portion of the Leased Premises or the Driveway\r\n  shall be taken by reason of condemnation or under eminent domain proceedings,\r\n  or if as a result of such a condemnation, eminent domain proceeding or of\r\n  modifications to adjacent public roadways, any curb-cut providing access to the\r\n  Leased Premises will be closed, then Tenant may terminate this Lease at Tenantâ€™s\r\n  option, to be exercised by notice to Landlord within sixty (60) days of such\r\n  event, if in the opinion of Tenant, reasonably exercised, the remainder of the\r\n  Leased Premises and/or access points thereto are or shall no longer be suitable\r\nfor Tenantâ€™s business.\r\n\r\nÂ Section 32(b) provided in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n\tIf subsequent\r\n  to Landlordâ€™s delivery of possession of the Leased Premises to Tenant in\r\n  accordance with Article 4, a portion of the Leased Premises and/or the Driveway\r\n  shall be taken under eminent domain or by reason of condemnation and if in the\r\n  opinion of Tenant, reasonably exercised, the remainder of the Leased Premises\r\n  and/or Driveway is/are no longer suitable for Tenantâ€™s business, this Lease, at\r\n  Tenantâ€™s option, to be exercised by notice to Landlord within sixty (60) days\r\n  of such taking shall terminate; any unearned rents paid or credited in advance shall\r\n  be refunded to Tenant.Â  If this Lease is not so terminated, Landlord forthwith\r\n  and with due diligence, shall restore the Leased Premises and/or Driveway to a\r\n  proper and usable condition.Â  Until so restored, fixed rent shall abate to the\r\n  extent that Tenant shall not be able to conduct business, and thereafter, fixed\r\nrent for the remaining portion of the term shall be proportionately reduced.\r\n\tTenant\r\n  shall be entitled to the award in connection with any condemnation insofar as\r\n  the same represents compensation for or damage to Tenantâ€™s fixtures, equipment,\r\n  non-permanent leasehold improvements and other property of Tenant, moving\r\n  expenses as well as the loss of leasehold estate (i.e. the unexpired balance of\r\n  the lease term immediately prior to such taking); Landlord shall be entitled to\r\n  the award insofar as same represents compensation for or damage to the fee remainder\r\n  (including damage to the Building structure, and other permanent leasehold\r\nimprovements made at the expense of Landlord under Article 5 hereof).\r\n\r\nOn October 29,\r\n  2004, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) filed a\r\n  condemnation notice.Â  The notice involved a strip of land along Highway 17\r\n  varying in width from one to fourteen feet for a length of approximately three\r\n  hundred feet, totaling 4,245 square feet of land. Â Prior to the condemnation,\r\n  the leased premises encompassed 100,493 square feet or 2.31 acres.Â  Tenant did\r\n  not terminate the Lease after the taking and continued paying $31,083.33 in\r\n  monthly rent as provided by the Lease.Â  Tenant, Landlord, and SCDOT agreed to a\r\n  condemnation award of $100,000.Â  Tenant and Landlord did not agree on the\r\ndivision of the award, and their dispute was referred to the master-in-equity.[2]\r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the master-in-equity, Tenantâ€™s expert witness testified that Tenant was\r\n  entitled to a rent reduction of $491.07 per month under the Condemnation Clause.[3]Â  First, the expert used the 2004 report generated by SCDOTâ€™s appraiser as a\r\n  baseline to determine the fair market value of the property itself (not the\r\n  leasehold) before and after the taking; he concurred with both the difference\r\n  in value to the property in fee and the acreage differential caused by the\r\n  taking.Â  Using the income approach, he then appraised Tenantâ€™s interest in the\r\n  award at $81,400, resulting from the reduction in rent over the life of the\r\n  Lease.Â  The expert witness arrived at this figure by determining the land in\r\n  the Lease was 37.4% of the total value of the property.Â  He determined the\r\n  taken land was 4.22% of the total land.Â  Next, because the taking only involved\r\n  land and not the building, the expert determined that it represented 1.58% of\r\n  the total value of the property.Â  Accordingly, 1.58% of the monthly rent Tenant\r\n  paid of $31,083.33 amounted to $491.07 per month.Â  The expert then calculated\r\n  the present value of the monthly reduction over the life of the lease and\r\n  determined the value as either $91,200 or $81,400, depending upon the\r\n  capitalization rate he applied.Â  The expert ultimately selected the $81,400\r\nvalue.\r\nThe\r\n  master-in-equity relied upon the contract between the parties and found that\r\n  Tenant â€œhas offered absolutely no evidence that the leasehold estate today is\r\n  worth less than the leasehold estate that it heldâ€ on the date the Lease was\r\n  either executed or delivered.Â  The master-in-equity further stated that Tenant is\r\n  â€œonly entitled to the difference between what they pay in rent and what the\r\n  property could be leased for.â€Â  As additional sustaining grounds, the master-in-equity\r\n  found: (1) that the leased premises â€œexcluded the first 20-feet of the subject premises\r\n  as a future right of way and within which the condemnation actually occurredâ€;\r\n  and (2) that, for purposes of the Lease, the condemnation action commenced when\r\n  Landlord notified Tenant of the threatened condemnation in Article 4 of the\r\n  Lease, which occurred prior to Tenantâ€™s possession.Â  Thus, the only alternative\r\n  under the terms of the Lease would have been to terminate the Lease.Â  Since the\r\n  master-in-equity determined that Tenant did not prove damages to the leasehold interest,\r\nhe awarded the full $100,000 to Landlord.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\nTenant raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tI. \r\n\t\tWhether the trial court erred in applying the common \r\n\t\tlaw standard to measure a tenantâ€™s portion of a condemnation award \r\n\t\tinstead of applying the condemnation provisions of the lease;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tII. \r\n\t\tWhether the trial court erred in ignoring the terms of \r\n\t\ta rent reduction condemnation clause in a condemnation allocation \r\n\t\tproceeding;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIII.\r\n\t\tWhether a condemnation clause is controlling between a \r\n\t\ttenant and its landlord in an allocation dispute under the South Carolina Eminent \r\n\t\tDomain Procedures Act;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIV. \r\n\t\tWhether the trial court erred in determining that a \r\n\t\tclause giving notice of a possible\r\n  condemnation affected Tenantâ€™s possible right to a proportionate rent\r\nreduction under the leaseâ€™s condemnation clause;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tV.\r\n\t\tWhether the trial court erred in holding, as a matter \r\n\t\tof law, that the lease excluded an area described as a future right of \r\n\t\tway;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tVI.&nbsp; \r\n\t\tWhether the trial court erred in holding, as a matter \r\n\t\tof law, that Tenantâ€™s only remedy in the event of a partial condemnation \r\n\t\twas termination of the lease;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tVII. \r\n\t\tWhether the trial court erred in finding that the \r\n\t\tcondemnation action commenced prior to Tenantâ€™s possession of the \r\n\t\tproperty; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tVIII. \r\n\t\tWhether award of the\r\n  entire amount of the condemnation settlement to landlord M &amp; T is\r\ninequitable?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA proceeding to\r\n  allocate any condemnation funds is by statute a proceeding in equity.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-460 (2007).Â  In an equitable proceeding, we may find facts in\r\n  accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â See Murrells\r\n    Inlet Corp. v. Ward, 378 S.C. 225,\r\n  231, 662 S.E.2d 452, 455&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008); see also Friarsgate,\r\n    Inc. v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n of South Carolina, 317 S.C. 452,\r\n  456, 454 S.E.2d 901, 904 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  However, our broad scope of review\r\n  does not require this court to disregard the findings of the trial judge who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their\r\n  credibility.Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d\r\n338, 346&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).\r\nMoreover, a case\r\n  with both legal and equitable issues presents a divided scope of review.Â  Thus,\r\n  â€œa legal question in an equity case receives review as in law.â€Â  Sloan v.\r\n    Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n  (citing Gunter v. Fallow, 78 S.C. 457, 59 S.E. 70 (1907)).Â  Questions of\r\n  law may be decided with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  Doe ex rel. Legal Guardian v. Barnwell School Dist. 45, 369 S.C. 659, 662, 633 S.E.2d 518, 519&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (citing Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320,\r\n  327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000)).Â  This court may correct errors of law in both\r\n  legal and equity actions.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338\r\n  S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719&nbsp;(2000) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n14-8-200 (Supp.1998)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTenant contends\r\n  that this case is one of contract interpretation and that the contractual\r\n  agreement controls the allocation of the condemnation award.[4]Â \r\n  As such, Tenant claims that the Lease provides two remedies in the event of\r\n  condemnation of the leased premises: (1) to have its rent proportionately\r\n  reduced for the remaining portion of the lease term; and (2) to share in the\r\ncondemnation award to the extent of any loss of its leasehold estate.\r\nLease provisions are\r\n  construed under rules of contract interpretation. Â See United\r\n    Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 105-07,\r\n  413 S.E.2d 866, 868-69 (Ct. App. 1992) (applying the rules of contract\r\n  construction to interpret the lease of a shopping center). Â One cardinal rule\r\n  of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of\r\n  the parties. Â Chan v. Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 289, 395 S.E.2d 731, 734\r\n  (Ct. App. 1990).Â  To determine the intention of the parties, the court â€œmust\r\n  first look at the language of the contract.â€ Â C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. South Carolina Health and Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584,\r\n  586 (1988).Â  The construction of a clear and unambiguous contract presents a\r\n  question of law for the court.Â  Ward v. West Oil Co., Inc., Op. No. 4389\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 12, 2008) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 18); see also Pruitt v. S. C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343\r\nS.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).\r\nIt is also a\r\n  question of law whether the language of a contract is ambiguous. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C 617,\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  When a contract is unambiguous, clear, and\r\n  explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, to\r\n  be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense. Â C.A.N.\r\n    Enters., Inc., 296 S.C at 377, 373 S.E.2d at 586.Â  Where an agreement is\r\n  clear and capable of legal construction, the courtâ€™s only function is to\r\n  interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties as found within\r\n  the agreement and give effect to it. Â Ebert v. Ebert, 320\r\n  S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  We are without authority to alter an unambiguous\r\n  contract by construction or to make new contracts for the parties. Â C.A.N.\r\n    Enters., Inc., 296 S.C. at 378, 373 S.E.2d at 587.Â  A court must enforce an\r\n  unambiguous contract according to its terms regardless of its wisdom or folly,\r\n  apparent unreasonableness, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights\r\n  carefully. Â Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 340, 491 S.E.2d 583, 589\r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Tenant concedes in its reply brief that the Lease is not\r\nambiguous.\r\nI.&nbsp; Rent Abatement\r\nTenant argues in\r\n  several of its issues on appeal that the master-in-equity ignored the terms of\r\n  the Leaseâ€™s Condemnation Clause calling for rent reduction in a condemnation\r\nallocation proceeding (addressing issues I-III).Â  We disagree.\r\nAs noted, the\r\n  Leaseâ€™s Condemnation Clause under Article 32 is divided into two sections,\r\n  32(a) and 32(b).Â  Article 32(a) applies only when all or part of the leased premises\r\n  is taken by condemnation prior to the tenantâ€™s possession.Â  Contrary to the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s findings, this event occurred after Tenant took possession of the\r\n  property.[5]Â \r\nThus, according to its terms, Article 32(a) does not apply here.\r\nArticle 32(b) of\r\n  the Lease addresses the rights and duties of the parties if part or all of the\r\n  leased premises is taken subsequent to Tenantâ€™s possession.Â  Because we view\r\n  the condemnation to have occurred after Tenant took possession of the property,\r\nwe find this article applicable.\r\nArticle 32(b) is\r\n  subdivided into two distinct paragraphs.Â  The first applies in the event of a\r\n  partial or total taking by condemnation: Tenant may either (1) terminate the Lease;\r\n  or (2) if not terminated, may claim restoration of the leased premises by\r\n  Landlord.Â  An entitlement to rent abatement and a proportional reduction in\r\n  rent is separate and distinct from the subject of the second paragraph, which\r\nis the allocation of any portion of the condemnation award under the Lease.\r\nAs our\r\n  supreme court has indicated, â€œ[w]hen a contract is unambiguous, clear and\r\n  explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, to\r\n  be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary and popular sense.â€ Â C.A.N.\r\n    Enters., Inc., 296 S.C at 377, 373 S.E.2d at 586.Â  Moreover, leases are\r\nconstrued in the same manner as contracts:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  terms of a lease, like the terms of any contract, are construed to achieve the\r\n  intent of the parties at the time the lease was entered into.Â  The courts must\r\n  construe and enforce contracts as written, in order to preserve the fundamental\r\n  right of freedom of contract.Â  In general, therefore, parties may bind\r\n  themselves as they see fit by contract, unless the contract would violate the\r\nlaw or is contrary to public policy.\r\n\r\nLexington Ins. Co. v.\r\n  Tires Into Recycled Energy and Supplies, Inc., 552 S.E.2d 798, 800 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999) (internal citations\r\n  omitted). Â As such, it is generally held that parties may agree in the lease to\r\n  a method or formula of valuation or compensation in the event of condemnation.Â  See City and County of Honolulu v. Mkt. Place, Ltd., 517 P.2d 7,\r\n  15 (Haw. 1973) (â€œWhere a landlord and tenant have contractually agreed as to\r\n  the disposition of compensation in the event of condemnation, such an agreement\r\n  is generally held binding.â€); City of Manhattan v. Galbraith, 945 P.2d\r\n  10, 12-13 (Kan. Ct. App. 1997) (â€œ[I]f the lease itself includes a provision in\r\n  respect of the rights of the parties in the event of the condemnation of the\r\n  leased premises, such provision is controlling, if applicable to the particular\r\n  case.â€) (citations omitted); City of Kansas City v. Manfield, 926 S.W.2d\r\n  51, 53-54 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996) (â€œ[S]pecific provisions in a lease spelling out\r\n  the respective rights of the parties to that lease are valid and controlling in\r\n  the event the property is condemned.Â  Such lease provisions have uniformly been\r\nupheld.â€) (citations omitted).\r\nHere,\r\n  according to the Leaseâ€™s clear, explicit and unambiguous language, no right to\r\n  an abatement of rent out of the condemnation award exists.Â  Moreover, under\r\n  these circumstances, whether Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent is an\r\n  issue beyond the limited scope of the matter referred to the master-in-equity;\r\n  his sole duty was to determine the proportional share the landowner (Landlord) and\r\n  Tenant should receive from the condemnation award. Â Bunkum v. Manor Props.,&nbsp;321\r\n  S.C. 95, 98, 467 S.E.2d 758, 760&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (â€œPursuant to Rule 53,\r\n  SCRCP, a master has no power or authority except that which is given to him by\r\n  the order of reference.â€) (citing Smith v. Ocean Lakes Family Campground,\r\n  315 S.C. 379, 381, 433 S.E.2d 909, 910 (Ct. App. 1993)).Â  Any entitlement to\r\n  rent abatement would be the subject of a separate contract action between\r\n  Landlord and Tenant and is beyond the scope of the order of reference.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we agree the award should not be allocated to Tenant on the basis\r\nof contractual rent abatement.[6]\r\nII.&nbsp; Preservation of\r\nGrounds of Appeal Other Than Alternative Findings\r\nHaving\r\n  disposed of the rent abatement argument, we next question whether Tenant has\r\n  preserved any other grounds of appeal relating to the condemnation award beyond\r\n  asserting that the terms of the contract should govern apportionment of the\r\n  award rather than the common law rule, and beyond the challenge to the\r\n  alternative findings.Â  A reading of Tenantâ€™s briefs to this court suggests the\r\n  gravamen of Tenantâ€™s position is that the contractual provisions of the Lease\r\ncontrol and that Tenant is entitled to rent abatement.\r\nIt\r\n  is well settled that an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000). Â Additionally, â€œ[i]f the\r\n  losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to\r\n  rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the judgment in\r\n  order to preserve the issue for appellate review.â€Â  Elam v. South Carolina\r\n    Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24 n.4, 602 S.E.2d 722, 780 n.4 (2004). Â Without an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing\r\n  court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed\r\n  error.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546. Â Furthermore, even if an issue is preserved at the trial\r\n  court level, it must still be properly raised and argued to the appellate\r\n  court.Â  See Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 191, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 684, 689 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating â€œissues not argued in the brief are\r\n  deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal.â€) (citing First Sav.\r\n    Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994)); See also Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating â€œa one sentence paragraph raised in an\r\nappellants brief was insufficient to preserve the argument for review.â€).\r\nTenant\r\n  asserted that Hamilton v. Martin, 270 S.C. 223, 225, 241 S.E.2d 569, 570\r\n  (1978) does not apply where a contract contains a condemnation clause and that Hamilton was a total taking case, but only raised this argument in the context of its\r\n  contract analysis.Â  Notwithstanding, Tenant agreed in its brief that where the\r\n  terms of a lease are silent pertaining to the method of allocation, the common\r\n  law is controlling.Â  Since the master-in-equity did not address whether Hamilton  was the appropriate common law method of valuation governing a partial\r\n  taking instead of a total taking, Tenant had an obligation to preserve the\r\n  issue pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Elam, 361 S.C. at 24 n.4, 602 S.E.2d at 780 n.4.Â  Moreover, although\r\n  Tenant arguably made this assertion before the master-in-equity, it has now\r\n  been abandoned on appeal as it has not been argued outside the applicability of\r\nthe Lease.\r\nTenantâ€™s remaining\r\n  grounds on appeal address either the master-in-equityâ€™s alternative findings or\r\n  the alleged inequity of the allocation decision.Â  Since we have addressed the alternative\r\n  findings, and since we find the equity argument not preserved,[7] we conclude Tenant is not entitled to a portion of the condemnation award based\r\n  upon contractual rent abatement; any entitlement to rent abatement would be the\r\nsubject of a separate contract action as previously indicated.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Leasehold Valuations\r\nfor Total Takings and Partial Takings\r\nWhile our\r\n  preservation concerns are significant, we recognize, at a minimum, Tenant\r\n  argued that the Lease controlled, not Hamilton, and we note that the\r\n  Lease indicates Tenant was entitled to a portion of the condemnation award for\r\n  â€œloss of leasehold.â€Â  We also recognize the statutory mandate in the\r\n  condemnation context to engage in an equitable analysis of the apportionment of\r\n  a condemnation award. Â As such, we analyze, for equitable and fairness\r\n  purposes, Tenantâ€™s colorable assertion that the master-in-equity improperly\r\n  relied upon the Hamilton method; pursuant to our equitable review under\r\n  the statute, we nonetheless would affirm since we may do so for any reason in\r\nthe record, whether or not raised and preserved.Â  \r\nParagraph\r\n  two under Article 32(b) directly addresses allocation of a condemnation award\r\n  between the parties as compensation for expressly defined categories of damages.Â \r\n  Tenant argues on appeal that this paragraph entitles it to compensation for any\r\n  loss of its leasehold estate and that the master-in-equity erred in denying a\r\nportion of the award.\r\nSpecifically,\r\nthe award allocation paragraph states:\r\n\r\n\tTenant shall be entitled to the award in connection\r\n  with any condemnation insofar as the same represents compensation for or damage\r\n  to Tenantâ€™s fixtures, equipment, non-permanent leasehold improvements and other\r\n  property of Tenant, moving expenses as well as the loss of leasehold estate (i.e.\r\n  the unexpired balance of the lease term immediately prior to such taking).Â  Landlord\r\n  shall be entitled to the award insofar as same represents compensation for or damage\r\nto the fee remainder. . . . \r\n\r\nThis section delineates the\r\nmanner in which any condemnation award shall be allocated.\r\nAs\r\n  indicated, the Lease specifically provides the items for which Tenant is to be\r\n  compensated in the event of condemnation.Â  Tenant asserts a â€œloss of leasehold estateâ€\r\n  entitles it to a portion of the condemnation award.Â  Because the manner in which\r\n  â€œloss of leasehold estateâ€ is calculated is not delineated by the Lease, the\r\n  master-in-equity relied upon what he considered to be the common law standard for\r\n  valuing a leasehold estate when considering the allocation of the condemnation\r\n  award. See Farr v. Williams, 232 S.C. 208, 212, 101 S.E.2d 483,\r\n  485 (1957) (finding when a lease contains no provision as to the effect upon it\r\nof condemnation, the court looks to the common law rule).[8]\r\nAs\r\n  previously noted, the master-in-equity here applied the same method of valuing\r\n  a leasehold estate as used in Hamilton.Â  In that case, there was a\r\n  conflict between a landlord and tenant over the allocation of an award from the\r\n  condemnation of leased premises.Â  Hamilton, 270 S.C. at 225, 241 S.E.2d\r\n  at 570. Â The master-in-equity there measured the leasehold estate as â€œthe value\r\n  of the use and occupancy of the leasehold for the remainder of the tenantâ€™s\r\n  term, plus the value of the right to renew the lease, less the agreed rent\r\n  which the tenant would pay for such use and occupancy.â€Â  Id.Â  In short,\r\n  the leasehold value in a total condemnation is the difference between the\r\n  market value rent and the rent paid by the tenant over the full course of the\r\n  lease including renewal options.Â  However, it is important to note that the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court merely relied upon the unappealed Hamilton formula as the law of that case procedurally, not as the law of this state\r\n  governing all leasehold estate valuations.[9] Â Id. Â Moreover, the taking was total in Hamilton, not partial, as\r\nin the case at bar.Â  Id.\r\nThe Hamilton  formula was later cited in Gray v. South Carolina Department of\r\n  Highways and Public Transportation, which was an inverse condemnation\r\n  case.Â  311 S.C. 144, 153, 427 S.E.2d 899, 904 (Ct. App. 1992) (rejecting the\r\n  capitalization of business earnings method as not conforming with the Hamilton formula for valuation of a leasehold estate) overruled by, Hardin v.\r\n    South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 371 S.C. 598, 607-08, 641 S.E.2d 437, 442-44\r\n  (2007).Â  In Gray, this court utilized Hamilton as a valid method\r\n  for measuring the value of a leasehold interest in a case where â€œthere was no\r\n  physical taking of a portion of property in which [sublessee] had a leasehold\r\n  interest,â€ but where the â€œproperty was no longer valuable as a service station\r\n  after the [abutting] intersection was closed.â€Â  Gray, 311 S.C. at\r\n  153-54, 427 S.E.2d at 904.Â  In short, this court applied the Hamilton formula to measure a leasehold interest where the damages (special injuries)\r\n  from the closing of an intersection effectively resulted in a total\r\ntaking of the sublesseeâ€™s leasehold (it closed its business).[10]Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  formula used in Hamilton is widely recognized as the proper method to\r\n  measure a leasehold estate when the leased premises are deemed entirely\r\n  condemned and taken.Â  See, e.g., U.S. v. Petty Motor Co., 327\r\n  U.S. 372, 381 (1946) (â€œThe measure of damages is the\r\n  difference between the value of the use and occupancy of the leasehold for the\r\n  remainder of the tenantâ€™s term, plus the value of the right to renew in the\r\n  lease . . . , less the agreed rent which the tenant would pay for such use and\r\n  occupancy.â€); Pepsi-Cola Metro.

Depâ€™t of Transp., 333\r\n  S.E.2d 6, 7 (Ga.

App. 1992) (holding the\r\n  â€œmeasure ofÂ  value of a leasehold estate is the value of the use and occupancy\r\n  of the leasehold for the remainder of the tenantâ€™s term, less the agreed rent;\r\n  the values are determined by the usual willing buyer, willing seller rule.â€); Exxon\r\nCorp. v. M &amp; Q Holding Corp., 269 S.E.2d 371, 376-77 (Va. 1980).Â  \r\nTherefore, in a total taking, the tenant is usually entitled to\r\n  the lease advantage, or â€œbonus value.â€Â  Simply stated, the â€œbonus valueâ€ is â€œthe\r\n  difference between the economic rental, which is the fair market value of the\r\n  leasehold interest, and the contract rental, which is the actual rent paid\r\n  according to the terms of the lease agreement, discounted to present value.â€Â  City\r\n    of Riverside v. Progressive Inv. Club of Kan. City, Inc., 45 S.W.3d 905,\r\n911 (Mo. Ct.

General Motors Corp.,\r\n  323 U.S. 373, 380 (1945).Â  Additionally, â€œ[t]he right to occupy, for a day, a\r\n  month, a year, or a series of years, in and of itself and without reference to\r\n  the actual use, needs, or collateral arrangements of the occupier, has a\r\n  value.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, a lessee, as temporary holder of these rights upon\r\n  the leased premises, possesses a thing of value which must be compensated if\r\n  taken unless the parties agreed otherwise.Â  Second, if the lessee was paying\r\n  exactly the fair market value of the leasehold prior to the partial\r\n  condemnation, then there is no bonus value; as such, â€œif the condemnation\r\n  reduces the value of the leasehold while the lessee is still required to pay\r\n  the same amount of monthly rent, damages result to the extent that the lessee\r\n  now pays a rent greater than the fair market value of the property.â€Â  Mobile Oil Corp., 675 P.2d at 288.Â  Under such circumstances, it is this value for\r\n  which the lessee is normally compensated in a partial taking situation. Â In its\r\n  simplest form, â€œthe measure of damages of a tenant is the market value of what\r\nis lost.â€Â  Id.\r\nTherefore, even though Tenant did not actually occupy or use the\r\n  strip of condemned property in the case at bar, it still paid rent for the\r\n  total leased premises, which included the condemned area, and had dominion over\r\n  it until taken.Â  Furthermore, Tenant continues to pay the same monthly rent now\r\n  as it did before the taking. Â Consequently, absent an agreement otherwise, Tenant\r\n  normally would be compensated in accordance with the general common law rule\r\n  for a partial taking upon proof of such damage, which is the difference between\r\n  the fair market value of the lease before the taking, and the fair market value\r\n  of the lease after the taking, projected over the remaining term of its lease\r\nand discounted to its present worth.\r\nAs\r\n  to damages, â€œthe burden is on a party pleading a fact to prove it.â€ Landbank\r\n    Fund VII, LLC. v. Dickerson, 369 S.C. 621, 628, 632 S.E.2d 882, 886\r\n  (quoting Jackson v. Frier, 146 S.C. 322, 329, 144 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1928))\r\n  (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  This general principle of litigation has\r\n  been applied to disputes concerning apportionment of condemnation awards in\r\n  other jurisdictions, and we apply it here as well.Â  See, e.g., Mobile\r\n    Oil Corp., 675 P.2d at 286 (â€œThe owner of the\r\n  leasehold estate bears the burden of establishing the damages sustained to its\r\n  leasehold estate as a result of the partial taking of the land.â€); Santa\r\n    Fe Trail Neighborhood Redev.

Naused, 218 N.W.2d 536, 539 (S.D. 1974) (â€œProof\r\n  of tenancy in the condemned premises is not necessarily proof of compensable\r\n  loss.â€); Colley v. Carleton, 571 S.W.2d 572, 574 (Tex.

The balance\r\n  of the damages, if any, would belong to the reversionary interest of the\r\nlandowners.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  imposition of the burden of proof upon the lessee merely reflects the\r\n  significant property interest of the landowner as fee simple owner, and\r\n  recognizes that what is not proven as damages by a tenant belongs, or reverts,\r\n  to the owner.Â  Because of the strong policy of our State in favor of the\r\n  ownership rights of the landowner, a rule allocating the burden of proof to a\r\n  tenant not only is consistent with this policy, but also is fair since the\r\n  landowner has Â permanently lost part of the property and would otherwise be\r\n  entitled to the award.Â  Moreover, the burden imposed upon a tenant to prove\r\ndamages remains the same whether the allocation proceeding is in equity or law.\r\nHere,\r\n  the master-in-equity utilized an improper method of valuation for a partial\r\n  taking.Â  However, the record does not include all of the essential components\r\n  of the appropriate valuation process in a partial taking situation. In estimating\r\n  the economic rent, Tenantâ€™s expert stated the gross potential income was\r\n  $373,000 per year.Â  The expert calculated Tenantâ€™s damages using two\r\n  alternative approaches, one using a 6.4 capitalization rate ($91,200) and the\r\n  other using a 7.2 percent capitalization rate ($81,400).[11] Â On direct examination, he also agreed that $81,400 represented the fair market\r\n  value loss to the value of Tenantâ€™s leasehold estate; however, this figure was solely\r\n  and improperly based upon the original gross potential rental income prior to\r\n  condemnation, not on the difference between the fair market value of the\r\n  leasehold before and after the taking.Â  The expert utilized a percentage based\r\n  upon the land taken and applied it in part to the starting figure of economic\r\n  rent.Â  Thus, the expertâ€™s calculation for the loss to Tenant was individually\r\n  based on the initial economic rent analysis and was not representative of the\r\n  difference in the fair market values, i.e. the difference between what a\r\n  willing and fully informed buyer would pay for the leasehold interest and the sum for which a willing and fully informed seller\r\n  would sell the leasehold interest before and after the taking.Â  The\r\n  determination of this difference in fair market value is critical to a partial\r\n  taking analysis because the damages suffered to a leasehold interest after a\r\n  partial condemnation may not bear a direct correlation to the percent of the\r\n  area condemned.Â  See Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. State, 238\r\n  N.E.2d 705, 711 (N.Y. 1968) (holding the trial courtâ€™s computation and award of\r\n  lesseeâ€™s damages linked directly to the percentage of property taken was in\r\n  error).Â  While there was evidence of the fair market value of the property in\r\n  fee itself before and after the taking, the fair market value of the leasehold after the taking does not appear in the record.Â  In support\r\n  of our conclusion, Tenant even acknowledges in its brief that the expert â€œdid\r\n  not offer an opinion of what the rental value of the entire property was worth\r\nin the after condition.â€\r\nWhile we agree the\r\n  master-in-equity erred in applying a total taking analysis as opposed to a\r\n  partial taking analysis, we find no prejudice since the appellant failed to\r\n  develop the record as to an essential component of the partial taking\r\n  analysis.Â  Similarly, if the supreme court were to adopt a method of valuation\r\n  based on any â€œbonus valueâ€ in the lease akin to that reflected by the Hamilton  method, the record fails to establish the â€œbonus valueâ€ claimed in this\r\n  case.Â  Significantly, the expert admitted on cross examination that as of the\r\n  date of his appraisal, the actual rent was the same as the gross income of the\r\n  Lease.Â  In short, no â€œbonus valueâ€ was shown by Tenant prior to arriving at its\r\n  stated damages to such an interest.[12] Â Thus, Tenant would not prevail even under a â€œbonus valueâ€ theory based upon\r\nthis record.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we need not decide with finality which method the supreme court would adopt\r\n  because under either method, the record supports the determination by the\r\n  master-in-equity that Tenant failed to meet its burden of proof.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find no prejudice and no reversible error. Â See Upchurch v. New\r\n    York Times, 314 S.C. 531, 538, 431 S.E.2d 558, 562 (1993) (â€œWe may affirm\r\n  the trial judge for any reason appearing in the record.â€) (citing Rule 220(c),\r\nSCACR).\r\nThe dissent contends we have reached beyond\r\n  a preserved issue in our discussion of the proper method of valuation, yet also\r\n  contends the statutory mandate of an equitable allocation proceeding need not\r\n  be raised and preserved in light of our scope of review.Â  Tenant clearly and\r\n  consistently asserted to the trial court and in its briefs to this court that\r\n  the contract controlled this dispute.Â  Only on appeal, after arguing at trial\r\n  that only the contract controls the entire dispute, does the Tenant ask this\r\n  court to find the decision inequitable.Â  Thus, our preservation concern is not\r\n  addressed to our standard of review; rather, our preservation concern focuses\r\n  solely on the arguments Tenant presented to the trial court.Â  If Tenant\r\n  contends it had properly asserted to the trial court that the award must be\r\n  equitably allocated, separate and apart from its consistent contractual method\r\n  of allocation argument, then Tenant should have requested the trial court to address\r\n  that argument after issuance of its final order.Â  See Langehans v.\r\n    Smith, 347 S.C. 348, 353, 554 S.E.2d 681, 684 (Ct. App. 2001) (wherein\r\n  issue of equitable subrogation was not preserved for appeal since the only\r\n  issue litigated before the trial court was the effect of contractual\r\nassignment).\r\nNotwithstanding, we respectfully recognize\r\n  and the dissent appropriately notes our broad scope of review in an equity\r\n  proceeding.Â  We further recognize a small portion of the leased premises was\r\n  taken and have considered the appropriateness of a remand.Â  However, even pursuant\r\n  to our scope of review, we normally would not turn our attention away from\r\n  appellate preservation rules. Â Tenant had the burden of proof and failed to\r\n  meet its burden under either a legal or equitable standard of review.Â \r\n  Utilizing our right to make factual findings pursuant to an equitable standard\r\n  of review is of no avail since the record does not present evidence allowing us\r\n  to find missing facts to meet even the erroneous standard of Hamilton, or\r\n  any other standard we propose.Â  Moreover, pursuant to an equitable standard of\r\n  review, we are not bound to accept, and we specifically reject, the testimony\r\nof the expert based upon our previous discussion.\r\nConsequently, we affirm the decision of the\r\n  master-in-equity.Â  While this conclusion may appear harsh, we are again reminded\r\n  by the Lease that Tenant may still seek a separate contractual claim against\r\n  Landlord for rent abatement if necessary, which in part, gives efficacy to\r\n  Tenantâ€™s position that the contract is controlling over this dispute. Â In fact,\r\n  not only does Landlord acknowledge this possibility of contractual rent\r\n  abatement in its brief to the court, but also Tenant admits in its reply brief\r\n  that it is not entitled to recovery for both rent reduction and loss of\r\n  leasehold.Â  Thus, we are not convinced a remand is appropriate, especially in\r\n  light of Tenantâ€™s contractual agreement.Â  Quite simply, equity would not lend\r\n  itself to both an outright award of the condemnation proceeds as well as\r\ncontractual rent reduction.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  conclude Tenant is not entitled to a portion of the condemnation award based\r\n  upon contractual rent abatement; any entitlement to rent abatement would be the\r\n  subject of a separate contract action.Â  Furthermore, even if Tenant properly\r\n  preserved the argument that the master-in-equity utilized an improper method of\r\n  valuation or in the event we were to employ an equitable review, we nonetheless\r\n  conclude the master-in-equity did not err in finding Tenant failed to meet its\r\nburden of proof.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\nthe decision of the master-in-equity is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED\r\nAS MODIFIED.\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\nHEARN,\r\nC.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part:Â  \r\nRespectfully, I concur\r\n  in part, and dissent in part.Â  I\r\n  would reverse and hold that the long-term Tenant is entitled to the portion of\r\n  the condemnation award which is supported by the only evidence adduced at\r\n  trial, or, in the alternative, I would reverse and remand to allow the\r\n  introduction of evidence under the correct method of valuation for a partial\r\ntaking. \r\nI agree with the majority that only Article 32(b) of the Leaseâ€™s Condemnation\r\n  Clause applies here, as Tenant had taken possession of the property prior to\r\n  the institution of the condemnation proceeding.Â  Additionally, the order of\r\n  reference limited the scope of the Masterâ€™s findings to the proper\r\n  apportionment of the condemnation award; therefore, any prayer for rent\r\n  abatement under the Condemnation Clause must be the subject of a separate\r\n  action.Â  I also agree the Master erred in his alternative findings that\r\n  Tenantâ€™s sole remedy was to terminate the lease, and that the Condemnation\r\n  Disclosure operated to exclude the condemned area from analysis under the\r\nCondemnation Clause.Â Â Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  notwithstanding the interpretation of the contractual Condemnation Clause, I\r\n  find that the main purpose of this proceeding was to apportion the condemnation\r\n  award, which sounds in equity, as specifically prescribed by Section 28-2-460\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2007) (â€œThe payment of the [condemnation] funds so\r\n  awarded must be held by the clerk of court pending the final order of the court\r\n  of common pleas in an equity proceeding to which all persons served with the\r\n  Condemnation Notice must be necessary parties.â€).Â  See also Gordon\r\n    v.

Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d\r\n  538 (1990); Townes Assocs., Ltd. V. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221\r\n  S.E.2d 773 (1976).Â  The majority holds any argument that the Master failed to\r\n  equitably apportion the award is not preserved for review; however, I view the\r\n  standard of review not as an argument that must be raised before a trial judge\r\n  in order to be preserved, but rather as the lens through which we are required\r\nto view the arguments on appeal.Â  \r\nGenerally, a\r\n  lessee, as the holder of a constitutional property interest, or as an â€œownerâ€\r\n  under eminent domain statutes, is entitled to just compensation when all or\r\n  part of the leasehold interest is lost by condemnation.Â  South Carolina\r\n    State Highway Dept. v. Hammond, 238 S.C. 317, 120 S.E.2d 21\r\n  (1961).Â  Moreover here, the Condemnation Clause specifically provides Tenant is\r\n  entitled to a portion of any condemnation award for a loss of its leasehold\r\n  estate.Â  At the time the property was partially condemned, Tenant had over\r\n  seventy-three years remaining on its seventy-five year lease and presented\r\n  expert testimony explaining the extent to which the condemnation diminished its\r\n  interest.Â  Conversely, Landlord presented no evidence Tenantâ€™s leasehold\r\n  interest was not adversely affected, nor did it object to the method of\r\n  valuation used by Tenantâ€™s expert.Â  Despite this, the majority finds Tenant is\r\n  not entitled to any portion of the condemnation award, a result the majority\r\n  acknowledges â€œmay appear harsh.â€Â  Based on our standard of review, I believe\r\n  this result is not only harsh, but inequitable.Â  I would reverse and award\r\n  Tenant the sum of $81, 400, the amount testified to by Tenantâ€™s expert and the\r\n  only figure supported in the record.Â  See Hough v. Hough, 312\r\n  S.C. 344, 440 S.E.2d 387 (1994) (finding a party cannot complain about the\r\n  valuation of an asset by a court where the party fails to present any evidence\r\non the issue).\r\nThe\r\n  majority posits, without actually adopting, a new rule in this jurisdiction for\r\n  the valuation of a leasehold in the case of a partial taking.Â  While the\r\n  scholarship inherent in the majorityâ€™s opinion is undeniable, this issue is not\r\n  before us.Â  No argument was advanced to the Master or before us on appeal that\r\n  a different method of valuation should be applied where the take is partial.Â  See Langley v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 181, 325 S.E.2d 550 (Ct. App. 1984) revâ€™d\r\n    on other grounds, 286 S.C. 85, 332 S.E.2d 100 (1985) (â€œ[A]ppellate courts\r\n  in this state, like well-behaved children, do not speak unless spoken to and do\r\n  not answer questions they are not asked.â€).Â  Moreover, while I agree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s conclusion that the Master erred in the method he used to value the\r\n  Tenantâ€™s interest, were I to adopt a new method of valuation, I would reverse\r\n  and remand.Â  I believe it is highly inequitable in this statutorily-mandated\r\n  equity proceeding, not to afford Tenant the benefit of a remand in order to\r\n  develop the record under a method of valuation which has heretofore never been\r\n  recognized in South Carolina.Â  See Mobil Oil Corp. v. Phoenix Cent. Christian Church, 675 P.2d 284 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1983) (reversing and\r\n  remanding under similar circumstances where the appellate court disagreed with\r\n  the valuation method applied by the lower court in a partial condemnation\r\nproceeding).Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, I concur\r\nin part and dissent in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The reference to Highway 21, rather than Highway 17,\r\nwas apparently a clerical error.\r\n[2] The order of reference specifically directed the\r\n  master-in-equity to â€œdetermine the proportional share the Landowner and Tenant\r\n  should receiveâ€ from the condemnation award.Â  No other issues were referred to\r\nthe master-in-equity.\r\n[3] Tenantâ€™s expert was the only witness to give\r\ntestimony.\r\n[4] We recognize the condemnation statute indicates that\r\n  any funds be held pending final order of the court of common pleas in an equity\r\n  proceeding.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 28-2-460 (2007).Â  However, the case was presented to\r\n  the master-in-equity as one of contract interpretation.Â  Although the issues\r\n  raised by Tenant at trial were of a contractual nature, our consideration of\r\n  the legal question presented as to the law governing the valuation of a partial\r\ntaking would be the same under a legal or equitable standard of review.\r\n[5] Tenant contends the master-in-equity erred in his\r\n  alternative finding that the condemnation action commenced prior to its\r\n  possession of the property, thereby leaving Tenant with the sole remedy of\r\n  terminating the Lease (addressing issues VI and VII).Â  We agree.Â  Both articles\r\n  in the Leaseâ€™s Condemnation Clause are triggered by an actual taking by\r\n  condemnation or eminent domain.Â  Thus, by written agreement of the parties to\r\n  the contract, the Landlord and Tenant had already decided that the date upon\r\n  which the land was â€œtaken,â€ in part or whole, would govern.Â  Accordingly, by\r\n  the terms of the Lease, the condemnation action commenced at the time SCDOT\r\nfiled the Condemnation Notice.\r\n[6] Tenant also argues the master-in-equity erred in his\r\n  alternative finding that the Condemnation Disclosure in the Lease acted to\r\n  exclude the area taken by condemnation from the leased premises, and thus from\r\n  the terms of the Condemnation Clause (addressing issues IV and V).Â  We agree.Â  Under\r\n  the terms of the Lease, the leased premises for which Tenant paid rent included\r\n  the twenty foot right-of-way area, within which the taking by condemnation\r\n  occurred.Â  The description of leased premises included all 100,493 square feet\r\n  of real estate on the plot.Â  While a twenty foot future right-of-way was\r\n  indicated in both an exhibit attached to the document, as well as the\r\n  Condemnation Disclosure, the area was still included within the total amount of\r\n  property leased.Â  Additionally, the area actually taken was less than that\r\n  demarcated on the site plan. Â Thus, the unambiguous language of the Lease shows\r\n  that the parties did not intend for the twenty foot right of way area, from\r\n  which a portion was condemned, to be excluded from the leased premises or\r\n  exempt from the Condemnation Clause.Â  Accordingly, the master-in-equity erred\r\n  in determining the Condemnation Clause did not apply to the area of condemned\r\n  property.Â  Since this was an alternative ruling by the master-in-equity, it\r\ndoes not affect our disposition herein.Â  \r\n[7] Tenant asserts the master-in-equity erred in\r\n  allocating the entire condemnation award to Landlord since that award is\r\n  inequitable (addressing issue VIII).Â  We find this issue not preserved for review.Â \r\n  The master-in-equity applied a contract analysis to the case, not an equity\r\n  analysis.Â  However, although arguably raised in its proposed order submitted in\r\n  lieu of a brief to the trial court, Tenant never filed a motion under Rule 59,\r\n  SCRCP, asking the court to address the issue.Â  Elam, 361 S.C. at Â 24\r\n  n.4, 602 S.E.2d at 780 n.4.Â  While we recognize the statutory mandate to\r\n  determine the issue of allocation in an equitable proceeding, the\r\n  master-in-equity was never asked to address that equitable apportionment\r\n  argument after issuance of his order; moreover, it would not change our result\r\n  because the same law of partial taking would apply in both a legal and\r\n  equitable proceeding.Â  Notwithstanding, we note the basis of Tenantâ€™s argument\r\n  at trial was that the provisions of the Lease controlled the disposition of the\r\nproceeds, not the statute.Â  Therefore, we find no prejudice.\r\n[8] The applicable Lease provision and parenthetical\r\n  indicates as follows: â€œthe loss of leasehold estate (i.e. the unexpired balance\r\n  of the lease term immediately prior to such taking).â€Â  Neither of the parties\r\n  at trial or on appeal have argued that this parenthetical language indicates\r\n  the parties clearly intended to limit the meaning of â€œloss of leaseholdâ€ to a\r\n  total taking situation by referencing the unexpired balance of the lease term\r\n  prior to the taking.Â  The term â€œi.e.â€ is a common abbreviation meaning â€œthat\r\n  is.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 762 (8th ed. 2004).Â  Since the parties\r\nfailed to argue this issue, we do not consider it on appeal.Â  \r\n[9] Since no appeal was taken from the formula used by\r\n  the master-in-equity and circuit court, the supreme court did not disturb the\r\n  method applied in Hamilton.Â  Id. 270 S.C. at 225-26, 241 S.E.2d\r\nat 570-71.\r\n[10] The South Carolina Supreme Court overruled the\r\n  â€œspecial injuryâ€ analysis used in Gray and similar cases, holding â€œthat\r\n  our focus in these cases is on how any road re-configuration affects a property\r\n  ownerâ€™s easements.Â  An easement is either taken or it is not.â€ Hardin, 371\r\nS.C. at 609, 641 S.E.2d at 443.\r\n[11] We note the existence of criticism of the\r\n  capitalization method as a basis for apportioning an award between a lessor and\r\n  lessee, since there is not necessarily a relationship between the loss a lessee\r\n  suffered and the amount of any allocation received.Â  â€œThe capitalization\r\n  approach is generally based upon the capitalization of the rental income of the\r\n  property.â€Â  Mobile Oil Corp., 675 P.2d at 287 n.2.Â  â€œThe sum of the\r\n  values of the leasehold and the reversion, as independently determined, is often\r\n  less than the market value of a fee simple estate in the land.Â  Application of\r\n  the capitalization approach in such cases confers a windfall upon the lessee,\r\n  who receives the balance of the award after computation of the value of the\r\n  lessorâ€™s interest.Â  Conversely, where the aggregate value of leasehold and\r\n  reversion exceeds the value of a fee simple estate, one of the condemnees will\r\n  be undercompensated.Â  Id. at 287. Â Thus, â€œ[i]t is neither a measure of\r\n  the damages suffered by the lessee nor an approximation of the market value of\r\n  the lease.â€ Id. at 288 (quoting Boyer and Wilcox, An Economic\r\n    Appraisal of Leasehold Valuation in Condemnation Proceedings, 17 U.Miami\r\nL.Rev. 245, 273 (1963)).\r\n[12] We further note that, while certainly not\r\n  controlling, the master-in-equity as trier of fact was free to accept or reject\r\n  any or all of a witnessâ€™s testimony, including that of an expert witness.Â  See Dixon v. Besco Engâ€™g, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 181, 463 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995) (â€œThe fact finder must determine the weight to be accorded the\r\n  testimony of the witnesses, and accept or reject their valuations.â€); see also Bray v. Head, 311 S.C. 490, 497-98, 429 S.E.2d 842, 846 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1993) (upholding the special masterâ€™s decision to decline defendantâ€™s\r\n  expert testimony, even though opposing party did not offer expert testimony); Miller\r\n    on Behalf of Grand Strand Diversified, Inc. v. Gandee, 285 S.C. 174, 178,\r\n  328 S.E.2d 482, 484 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œThe master correctly disregarded the\r\n  [appraiserâ€™s] testimony on the 1.51 acre tract because it relates to a fee\r\nsimple interest instead of a leasehold interest.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4436","title":"State v.

Â Whitner further argues the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by limiting\r\n  his cross-examination of a witness. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 2, 2003, the\r\n  Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Office executed a search warrant for narcotics at 202 Mack Street in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  Upon entering the house, the officers\r\n  secured all individuals in the residence and advised them of the search warrant.Â \r\n  The lead officer, Officer Torrence White, entered the house and found Teresa\r\n  Smiley standing in the doorway of the back bedroom.Â  He escorted Smiley to the\r\n  front room of the residence, where the officers already had detained Aaron\r\n  Garrison and Whitner, who were in the house when the police arrived.Â  The three\r\n  individuals remained detained together in the front room for over thirty\r\n  minutes.\r\nAfter\r\n  searching the house and finding large quantities of narcotics, Officer White\r\n  approached Whitner and asked him for his address.Â  Whitner responded â€œ202 Mack Street.â€Â  Whitner gave the address again on his booking form later that day.Â  A few\r\n  months later, Whitner gave the same address on his bond form.Â  The bond\r\n  form contained the statement â€œthe Defendant will notify the Court promptly if\r\n  he changes his address from the one contained in this order.â€\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  both Smiley and Whitner were charged with trafficking and PWID illegal drugs.Â  The day before Whitnerâ€™s trial, Smiley pled guilty to (1) trafficking in\r\n  crack cocaine; (2) PWID marijuana; (3) PWID marijuana in the proximity of a\r\n  school or park; and (4) PWID crack cocaine in the proximity of a school or\r\n  park.Â  However, she was not sentenced until after Whitnerâ€™s trial.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  Whitnerâ€™s trial, Whitner objected to and moved to suppress Officer Whiteâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding Whitnerâ€™s providing 202 Mack Street as his address during\r\n  the search.Â  Whitner argued the State did not meet its burden of establishing\r\n  Whitner was informed of his rights as required by Miranda v. Arizona,\r\n  384 U.S. 436 (1966), before eliciting the statement.Â  The trial court overruled\r\n  the objection.Â  Additionally, Officer White testified Smiley informed\r\n  him while they were executing the search warrant she and Whitner lived at the\r\n  residence.Â  \r\nSmiley\r\n  testified for the State, alleging she and Whitner were in a romantic\r\n  relationship and lived together at 202 Mack Street. Â She further\r\n  testified the drugs found in the house belonged to Whitner.Â  During her\r\n  cross-examination, Whitner questioned Smiley about the possibility of receiving\r\n  a diminished sentence for testimony favorable to Whitnerâ€™s conviction.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Whitner asked, â€œDo you know how much time youâ€™re looking at in prison?â€Â  The\r\n  State objected to the question and the trial court sustained the objection.Â  The\r\n  jury convicted Whitner of all of the charges.Â  Whitner moved for a new trial\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, maintaining cross-examination of Smiley to\r\n  determine potential bias was proper.Â  The motion was denied.Â  The trial\r\n  court sentenced Whitner to twenty-five years imprisonment for the trafficking\r\n  crack cocaine offense and three concurrent terms of ten years imprisonment for\r\n  the remaining offenses.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, appellate courts sit to review errors of law only.Â  State v.\r\n    Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  â€œThe admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  A trial court abuses its discretion when its\r\n  conclusions are controlled by an error of law or lack evidentiary support.Â  State v. Sweet, 374 S.C. 1, 5, 647 S.E.2d 202, 204-05 (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Statement During Execution of\r\n  Search Warrant\r\nWhitner\r\n  contends the trial court erred in admitting his statement giving 202 Mack\r\n  Street as his address during the execution of the search warrant because the\r\n  State failed to show the statement was voluntary and made in compliance with Miranda\r\n    v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ â€œIf\r\n  a defendant makes a custodial statement, then the trial court must not only\r\n  make an inquiry into the voluntariness of the statement, but also conduct an\r\n  inquiry to ensure the police complied with the mandates of Miranda and\r\n  its progeny.â€Â  State v. Ledford, 351 S.C. 83, 88, 567 S.E.2d 904, 906-07\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œIn order to secure the admission of a defendantâ€™s statement,\r\n  the State must affirmatively show the statement was voluntary and taken\r\n  in compliance with Miranda.â€Â  State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21,\r\n  25, 339 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1986).Â  \r\nCustodial\r\n  interrogation entails questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a\r\n  person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his or her freedom\r\n  of action in any significant way.Â  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444.Â  Interrogation\r\n  can be either express questioning or its functional\r\n  equivalent and includes words or actions on the part of police (other than\r\n  those normally attendant to arrest and custody) the police should know are\r\n  reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.Â  State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 431, 510 S.E.2d 714, 716 (1998).Â  Whether a suspect was\r\n  in â€œcustody is determined by an objective analysis of â€˜whether a reasonable man\r\n  in the suspectâ€™s position would have understood himself to be in custody.â€™â€Â  Ledford,\r\n  351 S.C. at 88, 567 S.E.2d at 907 (quoting State v. Easler, 327 S.C.\r\n  121, 128, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1997)).Â  â€œTo determine whether a suspect is in\r\n  custody, the trial court must examine the totality of the circumstances, which\r\n  include factors such as the place, purpose, and length of interrogation, as\r\n  well as whether the suspect was free to leave the place of questioning.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 583, 582 S.E.2d 407, 410 (2003).\r\nHowever,\r\n  a ruling to admit or exclude evidence must affect a substantial right to\r\n  constitute error. Â Rule\r\n  103(a), SCRE; State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609 S.E.2d 520, 524\r\n  (2005). Â No definite rule of law governs finding an error harmless; â€œrather,\r\n    the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from\r\n    its relationship to the entire case.â€Â  State\r\n      v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94,\r\n    391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â \r\n    Generally, an appellate court will not set aside a conviction because of an\r\n    insubstantial error not affecting the result. Â State v. Sherard, 303\r\n    S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  In State v. Gillian,\r\n  this court found the trial courtâ€™s error harmless because the testimony was\r\n  â€œlargely cumulativeâ€ to testimony from other witnesses and even omitting the testimony\r\n  at issue, â€œabundant evidence upon which one could\r\n  find Gillian guilty of murderâ€ remained.Â  360 S.C. 433, 456-57, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 62, 74-75 (Ct. App. 2004), affâ€™d as modified on other grounds,\r\n  373 S.C. 601, 646 S.E.2d 872 (2007).\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s admission of the statement is not\r\n  reversible error because the statement is merely cumulative, as (1) Whitner\r\n  gave the address again on both his booking and bond forms; (2) Smiley testified\r\n  he lived there; and (3) Officer White testified Smiley had informed him during\r\n  the execution of the search warrant Whitner lived there.Â  See State\r\n    v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 499-500, 629 S.E.2d 363, 366 (2006); see also State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 197, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448-49 (2003)\r\n  (holding the admission of improper evidence is harmless when the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502,\r\n  507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993) (finding any error in the admission of\r\n  testimony that is merely cumulative is harmless); State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613\r\n  (1983) (â€œIt is well settled that the admission of\r\n  improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€); State v. Evans,&nbsp; 378 S.C. 296, 299, 662 S.E.2d 489, 491&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2008) (holding the admission of testimony that\r\n  was merely cumulative, insubstantial, and not affecting the result of the trial\r\n  was harmless).Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not commit reversible\r\n  error in failing to suppress the statement.\r\nII. Cross-Examination of Smiley\r\nNext,\r\n  Whitner alleges the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  confrontation by prohibiting him from questioning Smiley concerning her\r\n  potential sentence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe scope\r\n  of cross-examination is left to the trial courtâ€™s discretion. Â Sherard,\r\n  303 S.C. at 174, 399 S.E.2d at 596.Â  Under the Confrontation Clause, a\r\n  defendant has the right to cross-examine a witness and elicit any fact showing\r\n  interest, bias, or partiality of that witness.Â  State v. Mizzell, 349\r\n  S.C. 326, 331, 563 S.E.2d 315, 317&nbsp;(2002).Â  â€œConsiderable latitude is\r\n  allowed in the cross-examination of an adverse witness for the purpose of\r\n  testing bias.â€Â  State v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 171, 399 S.E.2d 593, 594\r\n  (1991).Â  The record must clearly show the cross-examination is inappropriate before\r\n  the trial court may limit a criminal defendantâ€™s right to engage in cross-examination\r\n  to show bias on the part of the witness. Â Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 331, 563\r\n  S.E.2d at 317.Â  If the defendant establishes the limitation unfairly prejudiced\r\n  him, the error is reversible.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the trial court did not provide an explanation for sustaining\r\n  the objection or denying Whitnerâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Generally, the jury\r\n  is not entitled to learn the possible sentence of a defendant because the\r\n  sentence is irrelevant to finding guilt or innocence and could prejudice the\r\n  State. Â Id. at 331-32, 563 S.E.2d at 317-18.Â  However, the Confrontation\r\n  Clause limits the applicability of this rule when the defendantâ€™s right to\r\n  effectively cross-examine a co-conspirator witness about possible bias\r\n  outweighs the need to exclude the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  â€œ[a] violation of the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness\r\n  is not per se reversible error,â€ and we must determine if the â€œerror was\r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383,\r\n  386, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994) (quoting Delaware v. Van\r\n    Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)).Â  â€œ[T]he denial of the\r\n  opportunity to cross-examine an adverse witness does not fit within the limited\r\n  category of constitutional errors that are deemed prejudicial in every case.â€Â  Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 682. Â Error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the\r\n  trialâ€™s outcome. Â State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150,\r\n  151 (1985).Â  Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular facts of\r\n  each case and factors including: (1) the importance of the witnessâ€™s testimony\r\n  in the Stateâ€™s case; (2) whether the testimony was cumulative; (3) the presence\r\n  or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the\r\n  witness on material points; (4) the extent of cross-examination otherwise\r\n  permitted; and (5) the overall strength of the Stateâ€™s case. Â Mizzell,&nbsp;349\r\n  S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318; see\r\n    also State v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, 482, 445 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1994).Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s refusal\r\n  to allow Whitner to cross-examine Smiley on her possible sentence was not\r\n  reversible error.&nbsp; At trial, Smileyâ€™s testimony was not the only evidence\r\n  Whitner lived at 202 Mack Street. &nbsp;Whitner gave the address as his address\r\n  on multiple occasions.&nbsp; Smileyâ€™s testimony was merely cumulative to Whitnerâ€™s own statements.&nbsp; Further,\r\n  the trial court only prevented Whitner from asking the question at issue; the\r\n  trial court permitted him to elicit testimony from Smiley she had pled guilty\r\n  to the same charges as those with which Whitner was charged and ask her if she\r\n  was hoping testifying against Whitner would help her when she was sentenced.Â \r\n  Therefore, because the limitation of the\r\n  cross-examination could not have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial,\r\n  the trial court did not commit reversible error.&nbsp; See State v. Curry, 370 S.C. 674, 682, 636 S.E.2d 649,\r\n  653&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause\r\n  Whitner gave 202 Mack Street as his address two additional times after his\r\n  statement to Officer White, the testimony regarding the statement was\r\n  cumulative.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court did not commit reversible error in\r\n  failing to suppress the statement.&nbsp; Further, the trial courtâ€™s failure to\r\n  allow Whitner to cross-examine Smiley regarding her potential sentence was not\r\n  reversible error because Whitnerâ€™s own statements indicated he lived there, and\r\n  he was allowed to ask Smiley if she was hoping for a reduced sentence for her\r\n  testimony.&nbsp; Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Miranda v.

Waldron, Jr., of Bluffton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Deonte Elmore was killed after his car skidded off a wet road and\r\n  flipped in the median.Â  His mother, Angela Youmans, initiated wrongful death\r\n  and survival actions against the South Carolina Department of Transportation\r\n  (DOT) alleging it was negligent in failing to maintain the highway to avoid\r\n  rutting and not properly maintaining the medianâ€™s slope. Â A jury awarded\r\n  Youmans nine million dollars on the wrongful death claim and two million\r\n  dollars for the survival action.Â  The circuit judge reduced the judgment by the\r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act caps.Â  Ten months later, the circuit judge\r\n  granted a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine in an order stating\r\n  justice had not prevailed due to (1) the brief jury deliberations and (2) because\r\n  there was â€œno evidence to support the juryâ€™s determination that Deonte was not\r\n  negligent at all in losing control of his car.â€Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 17,\r\n  2003, Deonte Elmore was the driver and sole occupant in a single-vehicle\r\n  rollover accident on Highway 301, in Allendale County.Â  The sixteen year old\r\n  high-school student did not survive.\r\nAfter\r\n  attending a football game, Deonte dropped off a friend and began to drive home\r\n  in his Honda Accord. Â His mother, Angela Youmans, was returning home after the\r\n  game and saw her sonâ€™s car at a stop sign.Â  She called Deonte on his cell phone\r\n  and discovered he was going the same way.Â Â  Deonte followed behind his mother,\r\n  but Youmans drove faster and lost sight of his lights after going around a\r\n  curve.\r\nBehind\r\n  Deonte on Highway 301 was Willie Elmore (Elmore), a distant relative who knew\r\n  Youmans but did not know Deonte at the time.Â  Elmore testified Deonte was\r\n  traveling without apparent problems in the right, â€œslowâ€ lane at approximately forty-five\r\n  to fifty miles per hour.Â  The posted speed limit in the area is sixty miles per\r\n  hour.Â  After easing past Deonte, Elmore heard a bang and looked in his rear\r\n  view mirror to see lights â€œflashing up.â€Â  The Honda had left the highway, entered\r\n  the median, and flipped a number of times.Â  Elmore turned around, returned to\r\n  the site, and found a moaning Deonte lying in the road.Â  Youmans, meanwhile,\r\n  arrived at her house, heard the loud noise, and became nervous thinking Deonte\r\n  had enough time to arrive.Â  Unable to reach him on his cell phone, Youmans\r\n  backtracked down the road until she came upon the scene.\r\nIn\r\n  May 2004, Youmans filed wrongful death and survival actions against DOT.Â  In\r\n  the complaint, Youmans alleged Highway 301 was severely rutted and Deonte lost\r\n  control due to water pooled from the eveningâ€™s rain. Â Additionally, Youmans\r\n  asserted a dramatic drop-off in the median caused the Honda to roll.Â  She\r\n  claimed DOT was negligent for failing to maintain the roadway and the medianâ€™s\r\n  slope. Â DOT answered with a general denial, asserted immunities under\r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, and pled the defense of comparative\r\n  negligence.\r\nThe\r\n  actions were consolidated for trial.Â  Past and present DOT engineers asseverated\r\n  DOTâ€™s duties to (1) inspect and cure any roads pooling water; (2) maintain\r\n  median slopes to design specifications; and (3) the importance of a medianâ€™s\r\n  slope angle in allowing a stray driver to recover and avoid rollovers; Lorraine\r\n  Williams, the current Resident Maintenance Engineer for Allendale County, admitted\r\n  the median slope where Deonte wrecked deviated from the specifications. Â The\r\n  DOT employees stated they had received no reports or complaints concerning the\r\n  stretch of Highway 301 at issue.Â  Elmore, who lives in the area, testified it\r\n  had been raining the night of the wreck.Â  He knew the road to hold water and,\r\n  at the time of the accident, he said it held â€œenough to make a car sway.â€ Â The\r\n  friend who Deonte had dropped off prior to the wreck told the court Deonte\r\n  always wore a seat belt, wore a seat belt that evening, and did not use drugs\r\n  or alcohol.Â  Youmans called an expert in accident reconstruction whose studies\r\n  indicated the medianâ€™s slope caused the car to bottom out and contributed to the\r\n  rolloverâ€™s severity.Â  He estimated Deonte left the road traveling at\r\n  forty-seven miles per hour. Â Although he could not state conclusively Deonte\r\n  hydroplaned, he reported finding depressions on the road capable of collecting\r\n  enough water to create the hazard.Â  Officer James Oliver Freeman of the\r\n  Allendale County Sheriffâ€™s Office was a responder to the crash site.Â  He\r\n  testified that when he arrived there was water â€œlaying still on top of the\r\n  road.â€Â  \r\nDOT\r\n  called Allendale County Fire Chief Rodney Brett Stanley, Jr., who traveled on\r\n  Highway 301 when responding to the accident. Â He did not remember water on the\r\n  roadway that particular evening, but admitted on cross examination the road\r\n  holds water at times.Â  Donald Roberts, an expert called by DOT, contended the\r\n  slope of the road would not allow standing water.Â Â  Roberts stated â€œI wasnâ€™t\r\n  able to determine why the vehicle lost control.Â  I was able to rule out the\r\n  road as being a cause.â€Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the end of the evidence, Youmansâ€™ motion for a directed verdict on DOTâ€™s\r\n  comparative negligence defense was overruled.Â  The trial court denied DOTâ€™s\r\n  motions for directed verdict on the liability issue.Â  The jury was charged on\r\n  comparative negligence, including Deonteâ€™s duties to keep a proper lookout,\r\n  drive at a reasonable speed, avoid collisions, and use due care.Â  A five\r\n  question verdict form to be filled out by the jury was explained by the judge.\r\nAt\r\n  3:45 PM on June 8, 2006, the jury was sent out to begin deliberations.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, the forelady submitted a request for a copy of descriptions the\r\n  trial judge had read concerning grief and sorrow, loss of companionship, and\r\n  mental shock.Â  The jury returned with a verdict at 4:45 PM.Â  On the\r\n  verdict form, the jury indicated DOT was negligent and this negligence was the\r\n  proximate cause of Deonteâ€™s injuries.Â  In response to the question asking if\r\n  Deonte was negligent and whether the negligence was the proximate cause of his\r\n  injuries, the jury answered â€œNo.â€Â  Damages for the wrongful death action were\r\n  awarded in the amount of nine million dollars and two million dollars on the\r\n  survival claim.Â  \r\nImmediately\r\n  following the juryâ€™s discharge, the circuit judge asked if there would be any motions\r\n  to which the parties responded affirmatively.Â  DOTâ€™s motion for judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict was denied.Â  The judge asked DOT if they were going\r\n  to move for a remittitur and a new trial to which DOT answered â€œYesâ€.Â  When\r\n  court resumed the next morning, arguments on the motions were heard.Â  At the\r\n  conclusion, the motion for a new trial absolute was denied with the judge\r\n  explaining the verdict was not so excessive to shock the conscience of the\r\n  court.Â  He told the parties he would take under advisement the question of a\r\n  new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine and get a ruling out â€œas soon as\r\n  I can.â€Â  Later that day, the judgment was entered on a form that explained:\r\n\r\n  The jury returned verdicts of $2,000,000 on the\r\n    survival claim, and $9,000,000 on the wrongful death claim.Â  Because judgments\r\n    must be entered at the statute cap of $300,000 each, the parties agree it is\r\n    not necessary to rule on the Defendantâ€™s motion for a new trial nisi\r\n    remittitur.Â  I find the amount of the verdict, while very generous, is not so\r\n    grossly excessive that it shocks the conscience of the Court, and so I deny the\r\n    motion for a new trial absolute.Â  I am taking the motion for a new trial under\r\n    the 13th juror doctrine under advisement.Â  In the meantime, judgment\r\n    shall be entered in each case in favor of the plaintiff for $300,000.\r\n\r\nNearly ten months later, in an order dated April 10,\r\n  2007, the circuit judge granted DOTâ€™s motion for a new trial under the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine. The judge reiterated that DOT had moved for a new\r\n  trial absolute, new trial nisi, and a new trial under the thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine.Â  He agreed with DOT that no evidence supported the juryâ€™s\r\n  determination that Deonte was free of negligence.Â  However, the order most\r\n  heavily relied upon the judgeâ€™s conclusion the jury could not have given the\r\n  case full deliberation in forty minutes.Â  Thus, he determined â€œjustice has not\r\n  prevailed.â€ \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    circuit court judge err in granting DOT a new trial under the thirteenth juror\r\n    doctrine due to the length of the juryâ€™s deliberations?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œUpon review, a trial judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new\r\n  trial will be upheld unless the order is â€˜wholly unsupported by the evidence,\r\n  or the conclusion reached was controlled by an error of law.â€™ â€ Â Â Norton v.\r\n    Norfolk S.

THE RAISON D'ÃŠTRE OF THE\r\n  THIRTEENTH JUROR DOCTRINE\r\nYeomans\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting a new trial pursuant to the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  We agree.\r\nThe following\r\n  excerpt from Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996), outlines South Carolina jurisprudential history concerning the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    seminal case stating the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ doctrine is Worrell v. South\r\n      Carolina Power Co., 186 S.C. 306, 195 S.E. 638 (1938).Â  Worrell states:\r\n  \r\n    Nor\r\n      does it follow that because under the law the trial judge is compelled to\r\n      submit the issues to the jury, he cannot grant a new trial absolute. Â As has\r\n      often been said, the trial judge is the thirteenth juror, possessing the veto\r\n      power to the Nth degree, and, it must be presumed, recognizes and appreciates\r\n      his responsibility, and exercises the discretion vested in him with fairness\r\n      and impartiality.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWorrell, 186\r\n  S.C. at 313-14, 195 S.E. at 641.\r\nA review of the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ doctrine was\r\n  undertaken by the appellate entity in Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 387\r\n  S.E.2d 265 (1990):\r\n\r\n  This\r\n    Court has had an opportunity to reconsider the thirteenth juror doctrine on\r\n    several occasions. Â Each time we have refused to abolish the doctrine. Â We have\r\n    also refused to require trial judges to explain the reasons for the ruling. Â The\r\n    thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by which the trial court may grant a new\r\n    trial absolute when he finds that the evidence does not justify the verdict. Â This\r\n    ruling has also been termed granting a new trial upon the facts. Â The effect is\r\n    the same as if the jury failed to reach a verdict. Â The judge as the thirteenth\r\n    juror â€œhangsâ€ the jury. Â When a jury fails to reach a verdict, a new trial is\r\n    ordered. Â Neither judge nor the jury is required to give reasons for this\r\n    outcome. Â Similarly, because the result of the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ vote by the\r\n    judge is a new trial rather than an adjustment to the verdict, no purpose would\r\n    be served by requiring the trial judge to make factual findings.\r\n  A trial\r\n    judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will not be\r\n    disturbed unless his decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the\r\n    conclusion reached was controlled by an error of law. Â When an order granting a\r\n    new trial is before this Court, our review is limited to the consideration of\r\n    whether evidence exists to support the trial courtâ€™s order. \r\n\r\nFolkens, 300 S.C. at 254-55, 387 S.E.2d at 267 (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe trial judge, sitting as the thirteenth juror\r\n    charged with the duty of seeing that justice is done, has the authority to\r\n    grant new trials when he is convinced that a new trial is necessitated on the\r\n    basis of the facts in the case. Â Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321\r\n    S.E.2d 40 (1984). Â Traditionally, in South Carolina, circuit court judges have\r\n    the authority to grant a new trial upon the judgeâ€™s finding that justice has\r\n    not prevailed. Â Todd v. Owen Indus. Prods., Inc., 315 S.C. 34, 431\r\n    S.E.2d 596 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Similarly, the judge may grant a new trial if the\r\n    verdict is inconsistent and reflects the juryâ€™s confusion. Â Johnson v.\r\n      Parker, 279 S.C. 132, 303 S.E.2d 95 (1983). Â See also Johnson v.\r\n        Hoechst Celanese Corp., 317 S.C. 415, 453 S.E.2d 908 (Ct. App. 1995) (under\r\n  â€œthirteenth juror doctrine,â€ trial court may grant new trial if judge believes\r\n    verdict is unsupported by evidence and, similarly, new trial may be granted if\r\n    verdict is inconsistent and reflects juryâ€™s confusion). Â \r\nVinson, 324 S.C. at 402, 477 S.E.2d at 702.\r\nIn Norton\r\n  v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company, 350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854\r\n  (2002), the South Carolina Supreme Court explained, â€œthe thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine is so named because it entitles a trial court to sit, in essence, as\r\n  the thirteenth juror when [it] finds â€˜the evidence does not justify the\r\n  verdict,â€™ and then to grant a new trial based solely â€˜upon the facts.â€™â€ (citing Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 387 S.E.2d 265 (1990)).Â  The supreme\r\n  court further held, â€œ[T]he result of the â€˜thirteenth jurorâ€™ vote by the judge\r\n  is a new trial rather than an adjustment to the verdict . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  In essence, the judge, as the thirteenth juror, can hang the jury and start the\r\n  trial anew.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court recently affirmed a court of appealsâ€™ decision upholding the\r\n  grant of a new trial absolute under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  Trivelas\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 551-52, 593 S.E.2d 504, 508\r\n  (2004).Â  The supreme court reasoned the grant was warranted because justice was\r\n  not served by the juryâ€™s verdict, and the evidence did not justify the result.Â  Id. at 552, 593 S.E.2d at 508.Â  The Trivelas court held\r\n  granting a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine has the same effect as\r\n  if the jury failed to reach a verdict, and the trial court is not required to\r\n  give reasons for granting a new trial.Â  Id. at 553, 593 S.E.2d at 508\r\n  (citing Folkens, 300 S.C. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267).Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  â€˜thirteenth jurorâ€™ doctrine is not used when the trial judge has found the\r\n  verdict was inadequate or unduly liberal and, therefore, is not a vehicle to\r\n  grant a new trial nisi additur.â€Â  Bailey v. Peacock, 318\r\n  S.C. 13, 14-15, 455 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1995); see also Pinckney\r\n    v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 311 S.C. 1, 4-5, 426 S.E.2d 327, 329 (Ct. App.\r\n  1992).Â  \r\nII. Â Â Â Â  THE THIRTEENTH JUROR DOCTRINE/SUA SPONTE BY THE COURT\r\nYoumans contends the circuit court raised the thirteenth juror doctrine\r\n  on its own initiative.Â  Therefore, she complains the circuit court violated the\r\n  ten day time limit provided by Rule 59(d) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure when it granted a new trial ten months after the entry of judgment.Â  Rule\r\n  59(d) states:\r\n\r\n  On\r\n    Initiative of Court. Not later\r\n    than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court of its own initiative may order\r\n    a new trial for any reason for which it might have granted a new trial on\r\n    motion of a party. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be\r\n    heard on the matter, the court may grant a motion for a new trial, timely\r\n    served, for a reason not stated in the motion. In either case, the court shall\r\n    specify in the order the grounds therefor.\r\n\r\nThis Court traffics in a milieu of precedential conundrums, but\r\n  comes to the ineluctable conclusion based on the trial record in the case sub judice that the thirteenth juror doctrine was properly before the\r\n  circuit court.Â  Following the dismissal of the jury, the circuit court and\r\n  counsel for the parties engaged in the following colloquy:\r\n\r\n  Court:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  Are there going to be any motions?\r\n  Youmans:Â \r\n    Yes, your honor.\r\n  DOT:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Certainly, we want a judgment for an outstanding verdict.\r\n  Court:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  I deny the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\n  DOT:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I would like the ten days to re-file on the motions.\r\n  Court:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  I want to hear them now.\r\n  DOT:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Well, for a minute, Iâ€™m beyond what was offered here.\r\n  Court:Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  You are going to move for a\r\n    remittitur?Â  Are you moving for a new trial also?\r\n  DOT:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, I am.\r\n  â€¦\r\n\r\nThe court broke for the night\r\n  and continued the discussion the next morning:\r\n\r\n  DOT:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The defendant respectfully moves for a new trial absolute.Â  \r\n  Court:Â \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.\r\n  DOT:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The grounds I would cite are:Â  one, the\r\n    defendant believes the court should have bifurcated the trial and tried the\r\n    issues of liability and damages separately.Â  Secondly, the defendant urges,\r\n    would say that the court should have granted the negligence per se or, at\r\n    least, allowed evidence on the negligence per se issue.Â  Thirdly, that the\r\n    evidence was insufficient to send the evidence to the jury at least on the\r\n    conscious pain and suffering issue.Â  And fourth, that a new trial absolute is\r\n    required given the verdict.Â  The defendant would support and find that the\r\n    verdict was a result of improper considerations, namely reflect their intent to\r\n    punish which is not part of this trial and should have been on the verdict form\r\n    compensation, only.\r\n  Secondly,\r\n    the defendant would move for a new trial and nisi remittitur and ask the court\r\n    to reduce the verdicts to the statutory caps.\r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  The motions for a new trial\r\n    that relate to my evidentiary rulings and my decisions not to bifurcate the\r\n    trial are denied.Â  Now, then you had one more motion for a new trial absolute\r\n    and Iâ€™m not sure I understood what that motion was.Â  \r\n  DOT:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I asked that you grant a new trial\r\n    because the verdict was a result of improper considerations, namely, that due\r\n    to the short amount of time the jury was out and the note they sent out\r\n    evidence that they consideredâ€”it seemed to me they sailed right past liability\r\n    and went right straight to damages.Â  The tenor of their note indicated to me\r\n    that they were lookingâ€”looked every way possible to add money and punish the\r\n    defendant, the DOT, rather than compensate for the loss.Â  I think thatâ€™s\r\n    improper consideration.Â  \r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  All right. To the extent that your\r\n    motion is based on the speculative hypothesis that the jury might have intended\r\n    to punish the defendant rather than award compensation, I deny that motion.\r\n  DOT:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In addition, the amount of the judgment\r\n    is shocking and has to be based on improper considerations.Â  Itâ€™s way too much.\r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  Well, letâ€™s focus on that\r\n    motion.Â  You have anything to argue?\r\n  . . . \r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Weâ€™re looking at the legal question of\r\n    whether or not this verdict can stand under a motion for a new trial absolute\r\n    based on the amount of the verdict.\r\n  Youmans:Â Â  Yes, Iâ€™m sure they appreciate that.Â  And\r\n    that gets to why Iâ€™m having a hard time grasping procedurally what weâ€™re\r\n    talking about, because we know that, if we look at Smalls, that the\r\n    amount of the damages is not the judgment, itâ€™s not the verdict.Â  The verdict\r\n    is $600,000.00.Â  $300,000.00 for the wrongful death and $300,000.00 for\r\n    survival action and (DOTâ€™s counsel) agrees with that.\r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Well, if we were looking at it from the\r\n    standpoint of a remittitur, you would be correct.Â  And letâ€™s talk about this\r\n    because I think that ifâ€”if, I think what the law tells us, that if the verdict\r\n    is within the range of reasonableness andâ€”or short of the range of shocking the\r\n    [conscience], then the only thing that the court can do, if anything, is to\r\n    reduce it.Â  We canâ€™t eliminate it and start over.Â  However, if the verdict\r\n    rises to the level that it shocks the [conscience] because of its amount, then\r\n    the only thing the court can do is to start over with a new trial.Â  Canâ€™t reduce\r\n    it.Â  And where that line is, of course, is subject to the discretion of the\r\n    individual judge on the one hand and to a review for abuse of discretion by the\r\n    appellate court on the other.Â  So, I donâ€™t think weâ€™re talking aboutâ€”if all\r\n    weâ€™re talking about is whether or not I can or should reduce this verdict to\r\n    $600,000.00 or $300,000.00 or whatever itâ€™s going to be, then thatâ€™s an easy\r\n    question.Â  We can go ahead and do that and move on.Â  But thatâ€™s not what the\r\n    motion is.Â  The motion is that this verdict is so excessiveâ€”and Iâ€™m just\r\n    stating what the motion is, Iâ€™m certainly not indicating any view one way or\r\n    the other when I say that, but the motion is, if the amount of the verdict is\r\n    so grossly excessive that it shocks the [conscience] of the court and clearly\r\n    indicates that the amount was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice,\r\n    partiality, corruption or some other improper motive, then thatâ€™s the motion.Â \r\n    And if thatâ€™s what it is, then I donâ€™t think the cap comes into play because\r\n    the decisions of the supreme court tell us that if that is what it is, Iâ€™ve got\r\n    to grant a new trial.Â  And so, thatâ€™s our focus, I think, is whether or not the\r\n    amount of the verdict is so excessive as to shock the [conscience] of the court\r\n    and clearly indicate that it is the result of some improper motive.Â  Now, I\r\n    will tell you, I will say, that I think the verdict is huge . . . .Â  [M]y\r\n    initial impression is that this is a very large verdict . . . .Â  But thatâ€™s my\r\n    initial impression and I thatâ€™s where I think the focus of my inquiry must be,\r\n    is simply whether or not the amount of the verdict is so grossly excessive that\r\n    it shocks the [conscience] of the court.Â  Now, the question about how long they\r\n    deliberated and other things, I mean, I think that comes up under, I think,\r\n    under theâ€”if thereâ€™s a motion on a new trial based on the thirteenth juror\r\n    doctrine, thatâ€™s where those arguments become relevant, right now I think weâ€™re\r\n    just talking about the amount of the verdict.Â  \r\n  Youmans:Â Â  And judge, this is more a procedural issue,\r\n    but as I understood the courtâ€™s ruling yesterday, I think you wanted the\r\n    defendant to make new trial motions at that time.Â  Well. 59B says, either you\r\n    have to make an amend or at the courtâ€™s discretion.Â  You didnâ€™t exercise your\r\n    discretion or make an amend on anything concerning the issue and so I would say\r\n    that on this basis it is untimely.\r\n  Court:Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Well, I never like anybody to get\r\n    tripped up on a procedural step like what youâ€™re saying.Â  He made motion for a\r\n    new trial and when I hear a motion for a new trial Iâ€™m hearing that the three\r\n    bases that I have for a motion for a new trial:Â  motion for nisi remittitur,\r\n    motion for a new trial absolute and motion for a new trial based on the\r\n    thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  So, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been thinking about as I have\r\n    gone through the lastâ€”well, overnight, last night and today.\r\n  . . . \r\n  Court:Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâ€™ve already ruled when I denied the\r\n    motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict that the evidence is sufficient\r\n    to support the verdict.Â  Thereâ€™s no doubt in my mind about that.Â  That based on\r\n    the testimony and the record, the evidence the jury could have reasonably found\r\n    that this death was 100% the fault of the Highway Department and 0% of the\r\n    fault of Deonte but thereâ€™sâ€”I mean, thereâ€™s several things that trouble me about\r\n    it.Â  First of all I think that getting to that point is a complicated analysis\r\n    and they got there in almost no time.Â  The jury deliberated for a total of\r\n    about 30 minutes, I mean 45 minutes.Â  About 30 minutes after they started\r\n    deliberating, they came out with that question . . . .\r\n  About 5 minutes after I gave them\r\n    that, they came back with the verdict so, it raises a question in my mind of\r\n    whether or not the jury actually spent some quality time deliberating over the\r\n    liability questions in the case, which I think, regardless of everything we\r\n    just talked about, I think everything we just talked about illustrates my\r\n    point, which is not who should or should not win but the liability questions\r\n    were difficult.Â  And Iâ€™m troubled by it and I think the law requires me to\r\n    study whether or not the verdict here is based on a true and legitimate\r\n    deliberation over all issues.Â  If they had come back after two minutes with a\r\n    defense verdict and then it might be the same way.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . \r\n  Court:Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  I just donâ€™t think in light of all that\r\n    that I can say that this verdict is so excessive it shocked the conscience of\r\n    the court.Â  So Iâ€™m going to deny the motion for a new trial absolute based on\r\n    the excessiveness of the amount of the verdict.Â  Which leaves me with the\r\n    motion for a new trial that would have been made under the thirteenth juror\r\n    doctrine.Â  Now, letâ€™s straighten this out.Â  Do you contend that that motion has\r\n    either not been made or is not properly before me or has not been argued in\r\n    such a way that I discussed a few minutes ago or do you have any procedural\r\n    position to take regarding my ruling on that motion?\r\n  Youmans:Â Â  Judge, I think that it was not raised.Â \r\n    That it was not before you within ten days of the verdict.Â  You have the\r\n    discretion to consider any motion that could have been raised.Â  And so,\r\n    certainly, you can consider it.Â  \r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Right.Â  Okay.Â  All right.Â  Well, Iâ€™m\r\n    going to take that question under advisement.Â  Iâ€™m going to think about it.Â \r\n    And mainly, as I said, Iâ€™m going to focus on whether or not I feel the jury\r\n    sufficiently deliberated on what I see as a complicated set of liability issues\r\n    in the amount of time that they took.Â  So Iâ€™m going to take it under advisement\r\n    and Iâ€™ll get a ruling out as soon as I can.Â  \r\n  . . . \r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If either of you want to share with me\r\n    any of your thoughts or you legal research on the questions of what is the role\r\n    of the court in second guessing or in considering the quality of the juryâ€™s\r\n    deliberation on a certain subject, then Iâ€™d be happy to see that.\r\n  . . . \r\n\r\nYoumans:Â Â  And thatâ€™s in the context of the thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine?\r\n\r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes. And I could just grant a new trial\r\n    without even explaining my self if I wanted to under that doctrine.Â  But Iâ€™m\r\n    telling you and I want the record to reflect whyâ€”where Iâ€™m focusing and I think\r\n    that the law requires the jury to deliberate.Â  They canâ€™t just go in and say\r\n    â€œWell, what do you think?â€Â  Now, there are some situations where the evidence\r\n    is so clear one way or the other, that we donâ€™t question a verdict that is very\r\n    quick.Â  In fact, I had a verdict in a DUI case down in Beaufort where the jury\r\n    deliberated for six minutes.Â  And that was literally from the time they left\r\n    the courtroom to the time the bailiff came back to say that the jury had\r\n    reached a verdict.Â  And no body ever called in a vote because the evidence was\r\n    so clear that the defendant was intoxicated while driving.Â  But here, as I\r\n    said, I think there are complicated legal issues . . . .\r\n  . . . \r\n  Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  [T]he law requires the jury to\r\n    deliberate.Â  And in fact, itâ€™s implicit in the instructions.Â  In the\r\n    instructions, itâ€™s implicit in the role of a jury and itâ€™s implicit in the fact\r\n    that there are 12 minds that have to come together as one decision.Â  We also\r\n    know that the inner workings of a jury are for the jury.Â  No body gets in there\r\n    and says you have to do it this way.\r\n\r\nIn granting a new trial based on the thirteenth juror doctrine,\r\n  the circuit judge neither acted on his own initiative for purposes of Rule\r\n  59(d) nor did he rely upon grounds not in DOTâ€™s original motion.Â  DOT expressed\r\n  concern with the length of jury deliberations and sufficiency of evidence when\r\n  asking for a new trial.Â  Though DOT did not expressly request a new trial\r\n  pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine, the circuit judge clarified that he\r\n  considers three bases when presented with a motion for a new trial: new trial\r\n  nisi remittitur, new trial absolute, and new trial pursuant to the thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine. Â The circuit judge categorized DOTâ€™s quality of deliberation\r\n  concern as a matter relevant under the thirteenth juror doctrine. \r\nA colliquefaction of the judicial and/or counsel statements\r\n  persuades this Court that the thirteenth juror doctrine was posited to the\r\n  circuit court for arbitrament.Â  \r\nIII. LENGTH OF JURY DELIBERATIONS AND\r\n  THE THIRTEENTH JUROR DOCTRINE\r\nIn his order granting a new trial, the\r\n  circuit judge stated his agreement with DOT that no evidence supported the\r\n  juryâ€™s decision that Deonte was free of negligence.Â  However, the quiddity and\r\n  hypostasis of the order is the courtâ€™s concernment and advertence to â€œthe\r\n  quality and length of the juryâ€™s deliberations.â€Â  In the order, the judge\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  â€œTraditionally, in South Carolina, circuit\r\n    court judges have the authority to grant a new trial upon the judgeâ€™s finding\r\n    that justice has not prevailed.â€Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 404 (Ct. App. 1996.)Â  Defendant argues there is no evidence to support the juryâ€™s determination\r\n    that Deonte was not negligent at all in losing control of his car.Â  I agree.Â \r\n    More importantly, however, the Courtâ€™s real concern in the quality and length\r\n    of the juryâ€™s deliberations.Â  Observing the jury during the trial, the closing\r\n    arguments, the jury charge, and the several exchanges during the deliberations,\r\n    I was left with the firm belief the jury had not deliberated the case\r\n    adequately.\r\n  This is supported by the length of time of\r\n    the deliberations.Â  In a case of complicated and difficult liability on the\r\n    part of Defendant, in addition to the difficult question of why Deonte left the\r\n    road in the first place, it is inconceivable that the jury could have given the\r\n    case a full deliberation in less than 40 minutes.\r\n  The integrity of the justice system\r\n    demands that all participants in a trial perform their duties faithfully.Â  This\r\n    is particularly true of the jury, which is entrusted with virtually\r\n    unreviewable discretion as finders of the facts.Â  Every jury has a duty to\r\n    deliberate the case before them completely.Â  When the jury fails to carry out\r\n    this duty, then the fact finding process is flawed, and â€œjustice has not prevailed.â€\r\n  I want to make clear that I do not believe\r\n    there is any bright line past which a jury must deliberate the confidence of\r\n    the Court that they have performed their duty.Â  In some cases, even some of\r\n    significant complexity, a deliberation time of less than 40 minutes would not\r\n    raise any concern.Â  In this case, however, I have three major concerns.Â  First,\r\n    the time of the deliberation is inadequate to discuss the complicated issues in\r\n    the case.Â  Second, there is no evidence to support the juryâ€™s finding of no\r\n    comparative fault.Â  Finally, I drew a very strong impression during the last\r\n    few phases of the trial, particularly the deliberation phase and when the\r\n    verdict was announced, that the jury had not in fact deliberated the case.Â  For\r\n    those reasons, I am convinced that â€œjustice has not prevailed.â€\r\n\r\nYoumans\r\n  presented the following testimony for the juryâ€™s consideration: (1) eyewitness\r\n  Elmore stated Deonte was traveling below the speed limit at an estimated forty-five\r\n  to fifty miles per hour; (2) Youmansâ€™ expert opined from his tests that\r\n  Deonteâ€™s car entered the median traveling forty-seven miles per hour; (3) the\r\n  expert found the Hondaâ€™s tires to be in good condition; and (4) the friend who\r\n  rode in Deonteâ€™s car prior to the accident said Deonte wore his seatbelt and\r\n  was sober.Â  Because any negligence on Deonteâ€™s part was\r\n  raised by DOTâ€™s defense, the burden was on DOT to prove that negligence.Â  Comparative\r\n  negligence is an affirmative defense.Â Â Â  Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428,\r\n  437, 532 S.E.2d 612, 617 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The defendant asserting an\r\n  affirmative defense bears the burden of its proof.Â  See, e.g., Cole\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Elec. &amp; Gas, Inc., 362 S.C. 445, 452, 608 S.E.2d 859,\r\n  863 (2005) (â€œIt is well-settled that assumption of the risk is an affirmative\r\n  defense which the defendant bears the burden of proving.â€); Sabb v. S.C.\r\n    State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 428, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002) (governmental\r\n  entity bears burden of establishing discretionary immunity as affirmative\r\n  defense).Â  Our review of the record shows DOT presented no evidence of Deonteâ€™s\r\n  negligence.Â  Indeed, DOTâ€™s expert witness merely concluded, â€œI wasnâ€™t able to\r\n  determine why the vehicle lost control.Â  I was able to rule out the road as\r\n  being a cause of the rollover.â€Â  Insofar as this portion of the circuit judgeâ€™s\r\n  order is upon the facts, we find it is wholly unsupported by the evidence.\r\nA spate of\r\n  juridical writings confirms the strict parameters placed upon courts attempting\r\n  to police jury deliberations based upon a timekeeper mentality. Â Despite the\r\n  discretion given a judge by the thirteenth juror doctrine, it does not allow\r\n  the court to overstep these boundaries in toto.Â  Additionally,\r\n  granting a new trial due to suspicions of deliberation quality is a flagrant\r\n  deviation from premising a new trial upon the facts. Â See Fallon\r\n    v. Rucks, 217 S.C. 180, 189, 60 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1950) (reversing order for\r\n  new trial pursuant to thirteenth juror doctrine when granted not upon the\r\n  facts, but on â€œwholly untenable ground of objection to the verdictâ€™s formâ€\r\n  before amended by jury by consent).\r\n\r\n  As a general rule, the shortness of time taken by a\r\n    jury in reaching its verdict has no effect upon the validity of the verdict.Â \r\n    The brevity of jury deliberations does not indicate by itself, improper\r\n    behavior, or that the verdict was the result of error.Â  In this regard, while\r\n    the verdict should be the result of sound judgment, dispassionate\r\n    consideration, and conscientious reflection, and the jury should, if necessary,\r\n    deliberate patiently and long on the issues which have been submitted to them,\r\n    they may render a valid verdict on very brief deliberation after retiring,\r\n    especially where the facts are clearly drawn.Â  A court cannot infer misconduct\r\n    from the duration of the juryâ€™s deliberation.Â  The length of time that a jury\r\n    deliberates has no bearing on, nor does it directly correlate to, the strength\r\n    or correctness of its conclusions or the validity of its verdict. \r\n\r\n89 C.J.S. Trial Â§ 792 (2001).Â \r\n  â€œThe fact that the jury remained out only a short time before bringing a\r\n  verdict is not itself ground for a new trial.â€Â  66 C.J.S. New Trial Â§ 75\r\n  (1998).\r\nOur\r\n  supreme court heard a challenge to a verdict based on the juryâ€™s short\r\n  deliberation in Thomas v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 221 S.C. 462, 71\r\n  S.E.2d 403 (1952).Â  Thomas brought an action under the Federal Employersâ€™\r\n  Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A., Â§ 51 et seq., for damages for\r\n  personal injuries suffered on the job.Â  The defendant appealed the verdict\r\n  favoring Thomas arguing it should be set aside as the result of passion or\r\n  prejudice due to â€œ(1) its excessiveness in view of the injuries and (2) the\r\n  fact that the jury deliberated only twenty minutes.â€Â  Id. at __, 71\r\n  S.E.2d at 407.Â  Our supreme court first opined the evidence was sufficient to\r\n  support the juryâ€™s verdict and then explained:\r\n\r\n  While it\r\n    was unusual for the jury to arrive at its verdict in so short a time, we would\r\n    not be justified in concluding therefrom that the jury acted capriciously or\r\n    that it was [actuated] by passion or prejudice.Â  \r\n  â€œAppellate\r\n    courts should be slow to impute to juries a disregard of their duties, and to\r\n    trial courts a want of diligence or perspicacity in appraising the juryâ€™s\r\n    conduct.â€Â  Fairmount v. Cub Fork Coal Co., 287 U.S. 474 [1933].â€\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThe\r\n  brevity of a juryâ€™s deliberations did not provide sufficient grounds to warrant\r\n  a new trial following a murder conviction in State v. Holland, 261 S.C.\r\n  488, 201 S.E.2d 118 (1971).Â  In Holland, the appellants alleged their\r\n  motion for a new trial should have been granted because the jury verdict was\r\n  the result of prejudice and passion.Â  The jury was given the case at 5:15 PM,\r\n  returned to the courtroom to ask a question at 6:00 PM, and rendered a verdict\r\n  at 6:55 PM.Â  Id. at 499, 201 S.E.2d at 123.Â  Our supreme court ruled:\r\n\r\n  In State v. Chandler, 126 S.C. 149, 119 S.E.\r\n    774, we held in a murder prosecution that the defendant had a fair and\r\n    impartial trial, though the jury took only nineteen minutes to arrive at a\r\n    verdict.Â  In the recent case of State v. DeWitt, 254 S.C. 527, 176\r\n    S.E.2d 143, we held:\r\n  \r\n    â€œThere\r\n      is no prescribed length of time for a jury to reach a verdict.Â  Such must of\r\n      necessity be left to the judgment of the jury.Â  Something more must appear,\r\n      therefore to warrant interference with a juryâ€™s verdict than the mere brevity\r\n      of their deliberations.Â  23A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1368, at page 976.â€\r\n  \r\n\r\nHolland, 261 S.C. at 499, 201 S.E.2d at 123.\r\nThis\r\n  Court addressed the subject in Parker v. Evening Post Publâ€™g Co., 317\r\n  S.C. 236, 452 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 1994), a libel and invasion of privacy case.Â \r\n  The defendantsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict on the privacy claim was granted,\r\n  and the jury returned a verdict for the defendants on the libel claim.Â  On\r\n  appeal, Parkerâ€™s arguments included the assertion that the trial court\r\n  improperly denied his new trial motion based on the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â \r\n  We affirmed the denial and noted:\r\n\r\n  Parker\r\n    also appears to argue that the jury did not give due and serious consideration\r\n    to the case, because it returned the verdict in one hour, thereby ending their\r\n    deliberations one-half hour before the NCAA basketball tournament was to begin\r\n    on television.Â  This is rank speculation without any evidentiary support, and\r\n    we find it to be manifestly without merit.\r\n\r\nId. at 247 n.7, 452 S.E.2d at 647 n.7.Â  See also State\r\n  v. Cox, 221 S.C. 1, 68 S.E.2d 624 (1951) (affirming capital conviction when\r\n  jury deliberated only twenty-four minutes); Bratton\r\n    v. Lowry, 39 S.C. 383, 17 S.E.2d 832\r\n  (1893) (no new trial when verdict hastened due to fire alarm in town); Becker\r\n    v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 339 S.C. 629, 529 S.E.2d 758 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (finding no abuse of discretion in trial judgeâ€™s denial of motion for new trial\r\n  absolute after jury deliberated approximately twenty minutes).\r\nIV. OTHER JURISDICTIONS\r\nThe jurisprudence of other state courts similarly abides\r\n  by this general rule. Â â€œIt is the evidence and not\r\n  the time that the jury may have taken in reaching its verdict that is\r\n  controlling in the consideration of a motion for a new trial.â€Â  Â Mahoney v.\r\n    Smith, 78 A.2d 798, 800 (R.I. 1951)\r\nArkansas has refused to grant new trials based on the length of jury\r\n  deliberations.Â  D.B. &amp; J. Holden Farms Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Arkansas State Hwy.\r\n    Commâ€™n, 218 S.W.3d 355 (Ark. Ct. App. 2005), was a condemnation case in\r\n  which the jury returned a verdict after five minutes.Â  Holden, the landowner,\r\n  raised in his appeal the issue of juror misconduct.Â Â  The appellate court\r\n  affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of a new trial.Â  After Holden was unable to\r\n  prove jury misconduct or show prejudice, the court annunciated:\r\n\r\n  The length of time of jury deliberation is not, of itself, a\r\n    ground for a new trial.Â  Dovers v. Stephenson Oil Co., 345 Ark. 695, 128 S.W.3d 805 (2003), Wingfield v. Page, 278 Ark. 276, 644 S.W.2d 940\r\n    (1983); Breitenberg v. Parker, 237 Ark. 261, 372 S.W.2d 828 (1963).Â  As\r\n    the supreme court stated in Breitenberg:\r\n  \r\n    The fact that the jury returned a verdict in about eight minutes\r\n      after having the case submitted to them does not indicate to use that Beach did\r\n      not receive a fair trial when the issues of fact were so clearly drawn.Â  It is\r\n      true that a verdict should be the result of dispassionate consideration and the\r\n      jury, if necessary, should deliberate patiently until they reach a proper\r\n      conclusion concerning the issues submitted to them. Yet where the law does not\r\n      positively prescribe the length of time a jury shall spend in deliberation, the\r\n      courts will not apply an arbitrary rule based upon the limits of time.\r\n  \r\n  237 Ark. At 265, 372 S.W.2d at 831 (quoting Beach v.\r\n    Commonwealth, 246 S.W.2d 587 (Ky. 1952)).\r\n\r\nId. at 359.Â  See also Walker v.\r\n  Montana Power Co., 924 P.2d 1339 (Mont. 1996) (where relative complexity of\r\n  issues narrowed by court and counsel, and verdict form contained seven\r\n  questions, not error to refuse to set aside verdict rendered after forty\r\n  minutes of deliberation); Locksley v.\r\n    Anesthesiologists of Cedar Rapids, P.C.,\r\n  333 N.W.2d 451 (Iowa 1983) (three hours spent in deliberations not basis for a\r\n  new trial).\r\nOrders\r\n  for new trials based on hasty deliberations have been reversed.Â  The Florida District Court of Appeals, Third District,\r\n  reversed the grant of a new trial on damages in wrongful death and survival\r\n  actions in Park v. Belford Trucking Co., 165 So.2d 819 (Fla. Dist. Ct.\r\n  App. 3rd Dist. 1964).Â  The plaintiff argued in part that the jury spent only\r\n  twelve minutes deliberating liability thus â€œevidencing an utter lack of regard\r\n  for the performance of their sworn duties . . . .â€Â  Id. at 822.Â  In this\r\n  case of first impression, the appellate court determined the trial judge erred\r\n  and observed:\r\n\r\n  The courts which have considered this problem universally hold\r\n    that the length of time within which a jury confers is not in and of itself sufficient grounds\r\n    to grant a new trial. We agree with those\r\n    courts.\r\n  . . . \r\n  We do not disagree with the\r\n    proposition that a trial judge may grant a new trial where it is evident that\r\n    the jury has not followed the law as instructed or has generally abrogated or\r\n    failed to fulfill their functions according to law, but a jury verdict arrived\r\n    at in a short period of time is not sufficient evidence to establish the\r\n    fact that the jury failed to fulfill its function. The short period of time\r\n    would be some evidence, but without more it would be error for the trial\r\n    judge to grant a new trial. \r\n\r\nId. Â See also Lappe v. Blocker, 220 N.W.2d 570,\r\n  574 (1974) (trial court erred in granting new trial because â€œshortness of time\r\n  taken by a jury arriving at its verdict has no effect upon the validity of the\r\n  verdictâ€¦.â€).\r\nFederal\r\n  courts have considered the topic and are not persuaded to grant new trials due\r\n  to brief jury deliberations alone.Â  The United States Court of Appeals for the\r\n  First Circuit has instructed, â€œ[n]o matter how complicated the case, brevity in\r\n  jury deliberations is not, in itself, a basis for scuttling a verdict.Â  Courts\r\n  cannot hold a stopwatch over a deliberating jury.â€Â  Verdana Beach Club Ltd.\r\n    Pâ€™ship v. W. Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1383 (1st Cir. 1991) (citations\r\n  omitted) (no error denying new trial when jury resolved inconsistency between\r\n  verdict and answer to a special question in fifteen minutes).Â  \r\nThe United States\r\n  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held jury deliberations lasting four\r\n  minutes provided no grounds for a new trial.Â  Segars v. Atl. Coast Line R.R.\r\n    Co., 286 F.2d 767 (4th Cir. 1961).Â  In a case arising from a fatal railroad\r\n  crossing accident, presentation of the evidence required two days.Â  After the\r\n  verdict favoring the defendant was read, the plaintiff moved for a new trial arguing\r\n  the haste of deliberations indicated the jury did not consider the evidence. Â The\r\n  court disagreed:\r\n\r\n  We know\r\n    of no rule of law which prescribes how long a jury should be required to\r\n    deliberate before returning its verdict.Â  Of course, as was observed by the\r\n    District Judge, the verdict should be the result of conscientious deliberation,\r\n    but the fact that the verdict was returned within a few minutes does not\r\n    necessarily show that the jury disregarded this duty, and is not sufficient in\r\n    itself to justify a new trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 770.\r\nIn Will v.\r\n  Richardson-Merrell, Inc., 647 F. Supp. 544 (S.D. Ga. 1986), parents brought\r\n  negligence and strict liability actions against the manufacturer of a drug\r\n  alleged to have caused their childâ€™s birth defect.Â  Following an eight day\r\n  trial involving extensive testimony about drug research, the jury deliberated\r\n  approximately one hour before returning a verdict for the defendant.Â  The\r\n  parentsâ€™ motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial were\r\n  denied.Â  On appeal, numerous arguments were offered by the parents including\r\n  the assertion the brevity of the deliberations meant the jury did not consider\r\n  the entirety of the vast evidence.Â  Id. at 549.Â  The court disagreed\r\n  stating, â€œ[g]enerally, a short period of deliberation by a jury before\r\n  returning a verdict does not establish the proposition that the jury did not\r\n  properly perform its duty.Â  To prevail, plaintiffs must show something more\r\n  than the mere fact that the deliberations were short.â€Â  Id.Â  Cf. Kearns\r\n    v. Keystone Shipping Co., 863 F.2d 177 (1st Cir. 1988) (granting new trial\r\n  when brief jury deliberation was accompanied by verdict contrary to great\r\n  weight of evidence).\r\nIn Wilburn\r\n  v. Eastman Kodak Co., 180 F.3d 475 (2nd Cir. 1999), an employment\r\n  discrimination action, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found no\r\n  abuse of discretion in denying the employeeâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Although\r\n  the jury deliberated twenty minutes, the court explicated, â€œ[a] jury is not\r\n  required to deliberate for any set length of time.Â  Brief deliberation, by\r\n  itself, does not show that the jury failed to give full, conscientious or\r\n  impartial consideration to the evidence.â€Â  Id. at 476.\r\nThe thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine entitles a trial court to act as a thirteenth juror when it\r\n  finds the evidence does not justify the verdict and it may then grant a new\r\n  trial based solely on the facts.Â  Howard v. Roberson, 376 S.C. 143, 153,\r\n  654 S.E.2d 877, 882 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Norton v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.,\r\n  350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854 (2002)).Â  Though the circuit judge in\r\n  the case sub judice concluded no evidence supported the jury\r\n  finding Deonte free of negligence, this determination is contrary to the\r\n  record.Â  The only remaining justification in the circuit courtâ€™s order, the\r\n  brief jury deliberations, fails to provide sufficient grounds for a new trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  decline to place our approbation and imprimatur upon this thirteenth juror\r\n  order based upon length of time of deliberations.Â  The Latin phrase abundans cautela non nocet (abundant or extreme caution does no\r\n  harm) is efficacious.Â  Judicial interference with a jury verdict based upon the\r\n  time of jury deliberations is at best fraught with doctrinal vulnerability.Â  \r\nThe jury verdicts\r\n  as reduced pursuant to the South Carolina Torts Claims Act in the total sum of\r\n  $600,000 are reinstated.\r\nThe\r\n  order granting a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4438","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Mark A.\r\n  Martucci (Martucci) appeals his conviction for homicide by child abuse.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMartucci\r\n  lived with Brandi Holder (Holder) and her two-year old son (Child) in July\r\n  2002.Â  Child died on Wednesday, July 17, 2002.Â  Martucci and Holder were\r\n  indicted for homicide by child abuse under Section 16-3-85 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.Â  Martucci did not appear for trial and was tried in his absence\r\n  February 6-9, 2006.Â  The jury convicted Martucci, and his sentence was sealed.Â \r\n  On March 6, 2006, Martucci appeared in court and was sentenced to life in\r\n  prison.\r\nA\r\n  priori, the Court embarks on a\r\n  juridical journey encapsulating a temporal and spatial analysis of the\r\n  evidentiary record.Â  Nurse Ladye Kelly testified that Martucci and John Parker\r\n  (Parker) brought Child to the emergency room of Allen-Bennett Hospital.Â  Kelly declared Child appeared lifeless.Â  He â€œhad multiple bruises over most of his\r\n  body.â€Â  She described â€œa very odd patternâ€ of marks on his face which appeared\r\n  to be knuckle prints.Â  She stated Child â€œhad multiple bruises on his legs, on\r\n  his arms.Â  His eyes were blackened.Â  He also had a place around his mouth that\r\n  was scratches or abrasions . . . and had a lot of bruising.â€Â  Child had â€œa\r\n  purple black mark that . . . covered most of his back.â€Â  Kelly substantiated\r\n  the bruises â€œwere all in different stages of healing.Â  Some of them were very\r\n  fresh looking dark-purplish blue colors.Â  Others were yellow, barely noticeable\r\n  that had healed and were in between those two things.Â  Some were darker than\r\n  others.Â  Some were lighter than others.â€Â  She recalled that Childâ€™s abdomen was\r\n  â€œvery swollen.â€Â  He was â€œvery pale.Â  He was blue around the mouth,â€ which\r\n  showed he had not been breathing.\r\nKelly\r\n  assisted emergency room doctor Kevin Gregg in trying to revive Child, but they\r\n  were unsuccessful.Â  Dr. Gregg asserted the Child was â€œfreshly dead.Â  He was\r\n  coolerâ€”his temperature was cooler than 98.6, but it was warmer than room\r\n  temperature.â€Â  Dr. Gregg recollected that Martucci and Parker told him about a\r\n  â€œfour-wheeler ATV accidentâ€ earlier in the week.Â  Dr. Gregg declared they told\r\n  him that Child was not wearing a helmet on an ATV and â€œflipped or was ejected\r\n  out of the ATV, so the story went.Â  The story was that he looked okay after the\r\n  injury so the family didnâ€™t feel a need to bring him to the ER to get\r\n  checked.â€Â  Holder and Martucci advised Dr. Gregg that Child appeared weak and\r\n  had vomited several times the day before.Â  Dr. Gregg professed Martucci claimed\r\n  that he performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and Child â€œbit him on the upper\r\n  lip.â€Â  Dr. Gregg annunciated this story was implausible because â€œthat is\r\n  something Iâ€™ve never seen before.Â  Iâ€™ve never head of it before.Â  When you do\r\n  rescue breathing on somebody, they are unconscious.Â  And an unconscious person\r\n  canâ€™t bite. . . . I donâ€™t understand why an unconscious boy would bite somebody\r\n  on the lip. . . . If heâ€™s conscious, he doesnâ€™t need mouth to mouth\r\n  resuscitation.â€Â  Dr. Gregg recalled that Martucci had an open cut on his lip,\r\n  but he did not treat Martucciâ€™s injury.\r\nDr.\r\n  Gregg opined Childâ€™s injuries were inconsistent with the kind of accident\r\n  described.Â  He explained Child â€œhad bruises.Â  He didnâ€™t have cuts.Â  He didnâ€™t\r\n  have abrasions.Â  He didnâ€™t have the usual signs of wear and tear you see on a\r\n  two-and-a-half-year-old boy.Â  He didnâ€™t have skinned knees.Â  He didnâ€™t have\r\n  scraped up palms from playing or rolling or falling off the porch.Â  He had\r\n  bruises.â€Â  \r\nJohn\r\n  Parker (Parker) asseverated that he visited Martucci and Holderâ€™s home â€œ[f]rom\r\n  time to time.â€Â  He saw Martucci interact with Child.Â  He testified without\r\n  objection:\r\n\r\n  Parker: There\r\n    was an incident where we were in his living room and [Child] was crying.Â  And\r\n    Mr. Martucci had told him on numerous occasions to . . . He was askedâ€”Mr.\r\n    Martucci asked himâ€”or told him on numerous occasions to stop crying.Â  And\r\n    [Child] did not do so.Â  He then proceeded to tape his mouth shut with tape.\r\n  . . .\r\n  There\r\n    were episodes where he would be in the bathroom and Mr. Martucci would be\r\n    giving him a bath.Â  I would hear [Child] crying.Â  And I would walk in to see\r\n    what he was crying about and Mark would be pouring water over his head.Â  And\r\n    [Child] would continue to keep crying.Â  He would tell him that crying is for\r\n    pussys.Â  And he would dunk his head under water.Â  He did that on numerous\r\n    occasions.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: When you say â€œdunk his head under water,â€ was it a quick dunk?\r\n  Parker: No,\r\n    maâ€™am.Â  Iâ€™d say, at least, a couple of seconds at a time.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: How was [Child] reacting to that?\r\n  Parker: He\r\n    would swallow water almost like he was choking on the water.Â  And then he would\r\n    pull him up.Â  And then no soonerâ€”he would barely even catch his breath and he\r\n    would do it again.\r\n  . . .\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Did you witness anything else abusive?\r\n  Parker: We\r\n    were in the vanâ€”no, I take that back.Â  We were outside sometimes and then there\r\n    was a couple of occasions in the inside of his house where he would be crying\r\n    and Mr. Martucci would slap him in the face on both sides of his face.Â  \r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Can you sort of demonstrate in some way what youâ€™re talking about?Â \r\n    What kind of slap or force was used?\r\n  Parker: The\r\n    only way I can describe it is the way a person would smack a dog to make them\r\n    mean, back and forth.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Thatâ€™s what he did to [Childâ€™s] head?\r\n  Parker: Yes,\r\n    maâ€™am.Â  Iâ€™ve seen him grab his face like that when he wouldnâ€™t stop crying and\r\n    try to tell him to be quiet.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Did you ever see bruises or marks on [Child]?\r\n  Parker: I\r\n    did notice the bruises on his face from the way he was grabbing him.Â  And I\r\n    believe I did notice the bite on his wrist.Â  Theyâ€”it did seem that they went\r\n    out of their way to make sure he kept clothes on.Â  I very rarely seen him\r\n    without clothes, except for the incidents in the bathroom.\r\n\r\nDr.\r\n    Michael Eugene Ward, Greenville Countyâ€™s chief medical examiner, was called to\r\n    the hospital soon after Child was pronounced dead.Â  He declared:\r\n\r\n  On\r\n    initial examination at Allen Bennett Hospital, there were numerous bruises to\r\n    [Child] about the face, the chest, the back, and the extremities.Â  There were\r\n    injuries that were present around the perineum or the penis, and to one of the\r\n    arms that were especially disconcerting to us.Â  And so we took samples of them\r\n    at that time.\r\n\r\nDr.\r\n  Ward performed an autopsy on Child.Â  Photographs of Child and his internal\r\n  organs were admitted into evidence over Martucciâ€™s objection.Â  Dr. Ward used\r\n  the photographs to explain Childâ€™s injuries:\r\n\r\n  This is\r\n    a photograph of the left back leg of [Child].Â  This is right in the crux of the\r\n    leg.Â  And, as you can see, there are these bruises and superficial abrasions of\r\n    the skin running in a linear fashion across the skin.Â  These indicating that\r\n    this is a result of blunt injury.\r\n  So itâ€™s\r\n    not a sharp injury that you would expect from a knife or from some sort of\r\n    cutting instrument.Â  And itâ€™s not from a penetrating injury like a gunshot\r\n    wound, but itâ€™s a blunt injury where the skin is compressed and thereâ€™s\r\n    disruption of underlying blood vessels resulting in a bruise, as well as a\r\n    superficial abrasion or a scratching of the skin.\r\n  So this\r\n    is linear injuries or line-shaped contusions to the back of [Childâ€™s] leg.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Dr. Ward, in your experience and training, are there any particular\r\n    mechanisms of inflicting such a linear bruise?\r\n  Dr.\r\n    Ward: There are.Â  There are numerous instruments that can be used that will cause\r\n    a linear-type bruise.Â  Generally, they are things that are longer than they are\r\n    wide.Â  Certain things can beâ€”they can be cords.Â  They can be belts or even\r\n    fingers if a slap is applied in a hard enough fashion that create these linear\r\n    and sort of semi-circular type bruises as with this.\r\n  . . .\r\n  This is\r\n    a photograph of the perineal region of the body of [Child].Â  This is the\r\n    abdomen here, the pelvis, the penis, and the scrotum.Â  Here at the base of the\r\n    penis is a bruise, a sort of butterfly-shaped, if you will, bruise\r\n    approximately one and a half inch in greatest dimension.Â  Thereâ€™s a smaller\r\n    bruise in this region here.\r\n  And\r\n    right here at the base of the penis where the skin of the penis attaches to the\r\n    pelvic skin, thereâ€™s a superficial laceration or tear of the skin in this\r\n    region.Â  I took microscopic sectionsâ€”at the time of autopsy, I took microscopic\r\n    sections of the skin through this region here.Â  It demonstrated acute\r\n    hemorrhage or bleeding into the skin.Â  But it indicated that there was no\r\n    evidence of any healing.Â  There was no inflammation.Â  There was no granulation\r\n    tissue.Â  There was no evidence of repair to this region here or here.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: And what did that indicate to you?\r\n  Dr.\r\n    Ward: That is was a recent injury only aâ€”no more than a few hours old.Â  And as\r\n    we will see with other injuries that there were, there wasâ€”which have evidence\r\n    of healing that this act most very likely occurred at a different time than the\r\n    other injuriesâ€”some other injuries.Â  This is the result of blunt trauma. Â I\r\n    believe that this is a blunt injury to this region here with superficial\r\n    tearing of adjacent skin.\r\n  . . .\r\n  This is\r\n    a photograph taken at the time of autopsy showing the intraabdominal cavity of\r\n    [Child].Â  There were bruises on the outer surface of the skin.Â  As we dissected\r\n    beneath, there wasâ€”there were bruising beneath the skin and above the muscles\r\n    of the abdomen.\r\n  When we\r\n    reflected those muscles of the abdomen, we were able to demonstrate that there\r\n    was over 250 milliliters of blood present in the peritoneal cavity or in the\r\n    abdominal cavity.Â  350 milliliters is about the size of a can of Coke.Â  So this\r\n    is almost the amount of blood thatâ€™s in a can of Coke or a little bit less than\r\n    that.\r\n  This is\r\n    the small intestine here.Â  And this is the large intestine.Â  As you can see,\r\n    thereâ€™s a space between here that should not normally be.Â  Thereâ€™s a fatty\r\n    ligament that normally attaches this large intestine to the underlying\r\n    structures of the abdomen.Â  This has been torn.Â  Itâ€™s been torn away from the\r\n    underlying surface of the large intestine.Â  And in this region here, there is\r\n    blood that is hemorrhaged within the outer surface of the large intestine, as\r\n    well asâ€”\r\n  . . .\r\n  Stateâ€™s\r\n    Exhibit No. 13, again, demonstrates the tearing of the ligament that normally\r\n    attaches the large intestine to the stomach demonstrating that it has been torn\r\n    away along this broad surface of the transverse colon, hemorrhage within the\r\n    outer surface of the colon, as well as hemorrhage deep down in the structures\r\n    of the abdomen.Â  Within this region here, itâ€™s the head of the pancreas.Â  There\r\n    have been trauma and hemorrhage to the head of the pancreas with the soft\r\n    tissue surrounding the pancreas with hemorrhage. \r\n  And the\r\n    interesting thing about this injury is that when I took microscopic sections\r\n    from this region, it did show evidence of healing, that there were\r\n    evidenceâ€”there were areas that showed not only acute hemorrhage, but there were\r\n    other areas that showed hemorrhage that had been there for a period of time,\r\n    several hours to a couple of days such that the body had started to react to\r\n    this injury.Â  It had started to try to repair it.Â  And there wasâ€”there were\r\n    fibrous tissues being laid down.Â  There were new blood vessels there.Â  There\r\n    were cells that come in and try to clean up this blood.\r\n  So we\r\n    have two different ages of trauma here in the abdomen.Â  Weâ€™ve got some that\r\n    shows evidence of healing, and some that show no evidence of healing and only\r\n    fresh blood.\r\n  . . .\r\n  The\r\n    blunt injuries to [Childâ€™s] gastrointestinal system would, basically, cause his\r\n    small and large intestine to no longer function in the way that we know it to\r\n    do.Â  The small intestine, basically, takes food, water, and other products from\r\n    the stomach and allows it to pass and begin to digest on its way down to the\r\n    large intestine.Â  When you traumatize the small intestine, as [Child] had with\r\n    tearing of the mucosa, then the musclesâ€”the smooth muscles in the small\r\n    intestine are no longer going to work together to move things down the system.Â \r\n    So theyâ€™re going to back up.Â  \r\n  And the\r\n    most common presentation of someone with trauma to the small intestine like\r\n    that and no longer moving fluids out would be vomiting, in that anything that\r\n    goes in is going to sit on the stomach and not be able to be passed down.Â  The\r\n    pressure is going to be increased.Â  And then the person would have nausea and\r\n    vomiting.Â  Certainly, I would expect it to be, obviously fairly painful in that\r\n    he may even show some guarding and not want you to touch his stomach.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\r\n  Venesky (Venesky) lived next door to Martucci and Holder.Â  Her husband took two\r\n  pictures of her and Child while he visited their house on June 20, 2002.Â  In\r\n  the pictures, Child was not wearing a shirt.Â  Dr. Ward discussed:\r\n\r\n  These\r\n    bruises here [in Veneskyâ€™s pictures] are notâ€”although theyâ€™re in the same\r\n    location, theyâ€™re not the same bruises that we saw at the time of autopsy.Â  So\r\n    he has bruises here at this time.Â  He has separate and distinct bruises in\r\n    virtually the same place at the time of autopsy.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did trial judge err in admitting\r\n  autopsy photographs of Child&rsquo;s internal organs and other injuries?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II. \r\n    Did the

Vang,\r\n  353 S.C. 78, 87, 577 S.E.2d 225, 229 (Ct.

Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480\r\n  S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997).Â  â€œTo constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must\r\n  create a â€˜tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though\r\n  not necessarily, an emotional one.â€™â€Â  Kelley, 319 S.C. at 178, 460\r\n  S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting State v.

App. 2000). \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the photographs were introduced to corroborate the testimony\r\n  of Dr. Ward, who testified regarding the various injuries inflicted on Child,\r\n  including the discoloration of the bruises and the internal trauma which caused\r\n  his death.Â  The photographs were relevant to prove Child was abused, that the\r\n  abuse was the cause of his death, and that the abuse manifested an extreme\r\n  indifference to human life, all of which support the charge of homicide by\r\n  child abuse.Â  See S.C. Code Ann Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2003).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the photographs were necessary to depict the severity of the bruises and the\r\n  resulting trauma, which was inconsistent with accidental injury or play.Â  The\r\n  photographs were relevant and necessary, and they were not introduced with the\r\n  intent to inflame, elicit the sympathy of, or prejudice the jury.Â  The trial\r\n  judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photographs.Â  See Jarrell,\r\n  350 S.C. at 106, 564 S.E.2d at 371 (upholding the admission of graphic autopsy\r\n  photographs in homicide by child abuse case because they corroborated testimony\r\n  and demonstrated the extent of the injuries); see also State v.\r\n    Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 121, 481 S.E.2d 118, 124 (1997) (admitting a\r\n  photograph of the victimâ€™s face because it demonstrated the angle and distance\r\n  from which the victim was shot); State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 508 466\r\n  S.E.2d 349, 353 (1996) (holding trial court did not err in admitting\r\n  photographs during trial which (1) corroborated testimony regarding the various\r\n  places in which the victim was stabbed; (2) corroborated testimony indicating\r\n  the likelihood the victim died of the stab wounds; (3) were used to show\r\n  malice, an element of the crime charged; and (4) were later reviewed by the\r\n  supreme court and found not to be unduly prejudicial to the defendant).\r\nII. Evidence\r\n  of prior incideNTS of alleged abuse of Child\r\nMartucci\r\n  argues the judge committed reversible error in admitting (1) Parkerâ€™s testimony\r\n  alleging prior incidents where Martucci abused Child and (2) photographs taken\r\n  by Elizabeth Venesky showing external bruising to Child several weeks before\r\n  his death.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of\r\n  evidence and his decision should not be disturbed absent prejudicial abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 78, 480 S.E.2d at 72.Â  Evidence is\r\n  relevant if it has â€œany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œAll relevant\r\n  evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the\r\n  United States, the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, statutes, these\r\n  rules, or by other rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.â€Â \r\n  Rule 402, SCRE.Â  Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State\r\n    v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 35, 538 S.E.2d 248, 256 (2000).Â  The determination\r\n  of prejudice must be based on the entire record, and the result will generally\r\n  turn on the facts of each case.Â  State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. 57, 62, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 325, 328 (2000).Â  Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it has an undue\r\n  tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, such as an emotional one.Â  Saltz,\r\n  346 S.C. at 127, 551 S.E.2d at 247.Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina law precludes evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior crimes or other bad acts\r\n  to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime charged, except to establish: (1)\r\n  motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence of mistake or accident, (4) a common scheme\r\n  or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other\r\n  that proof of one tends to establish the other, or (5) the identity of the\r\n  perpetrator.Â  State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999); State\r\n    v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923); State v. Sweat, 362 S.C.\r\n  117, 123, 606 S.E.2d 508, 511 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  If not the subject of a\r\n  conviction, proof of prior bad acts must be clear and convincing.Â  State v.\r\n    Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 468, 523 S.E.2d 787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  When\r\n  considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence, this court is bound\r\n  by the trial judgeâ€™s findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v.\r\n    Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 325, 580 S.E.2d 186, 189 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The record\r\n  must support a logical relevance between the prior bad act and the crime for\r\n  which the defendant is accused.Â  Id. at 329, 580 S.E.2d at 192.Â  Even\r\n  though the evidence is clear and convincing, and falls within a Lyle exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id. at 324, 580 S.E.2d at 189.Â  If there is any evidence to support the admission of\r\n  bad act evidence, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling cannot be disturbed on appeal.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\na.Â \r\n  Intent/Absence of Mistake or Accident\r\nIn a\r\n  prosecution for homicide by child abuse, â€œextreme indifferenceâ€ is in the\r\n  nature of â€œa culpable mental state . . . and therefore is akin to intent.â€Â  Jarrell,\r\n  350 S.C. at 98, 564 S.E.2d at 366; see also State v. McKnight,\r\n  352 S.C. 635, 644, 576 S.E.2d 168, 172-73 (2003).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  prior abuse or neglect at issue was admissible as proof of intent and the\r\n  absence of accident.Â  The State contended Martucci killed Child while\r\n  committing child abuse or neglect under circumstances manifesting an extreme\r\n  indifference to human life.Â  The prior abuse or neglect at issue in the weeks\r\n  before the infliction of the fatal injuries was relevant to the material issue\r\n  of Martucciâ€™s state of mind.Â  Martucciâ€™s hostility, cruelty, and abuse toward\r\n  Child could be established by evidence that, during the weeks before he died,\r\n  Martucci abused Child by slapping his face, taping his mouth shut, and dunking\r\n  his head in the bathtub until he choked to stop him from crying.Â  The presence\r\n  of bite marks and bruises, and the fact that Martucci kept Childâ€™s skin covered\r\n  and rarely let him out of the house in the apparent attempt to conceal the\r\n  abuse, is further evidence of Martucciâ€™s state of mind to inflict the fatal\r\n  injuries.Â  Because Martucci disputed the motive and intent to commit homicide by\r\n  child abuse, evidence of the prior abuse or neglect was highly probative of his\r\n  guilt on the homicide charge.Â  The evidence was necessary to establish a\r\n  material fact or element of the crime charged.Â  See State v. Smith,\r\n  337 S.C. 27, 522 S.E.2d 598 (1999) (defendantâ€™s prior criminal domestic\r\n  violence conviction admissible to establish his intent to kill and the absence\r\n  of mistake or accident); State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 606 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 2004) (evidence of a prior episode of domestic violence was admissible in\r\n  prosecution for first-degree burglary, assault and battery with intent to kill,\r\n  and assault of a high and aggravated nature; to show defendantâ€™s motive, that\r\n  defendant was driven by anger over ex-girlfriend causing him to go to jail and\r\n  terminating their relationship, and that he intended to â€œget his propertyâ€; and\r\n  intent, that defendant maliciously sought to inflict harm upon ex-girlfriend\r\n  and her new boyfriend).Â  \r\nChief\r\n  Justice Toal recently articulated the difficulty the State faces in proving\r\n  child abuse: \r\n\r\n  Child abuse differs from other types of crimes in several respects.Â \r\n    Specifically, the crime of child abuse often occurs in secret, typically in the\r\n    privacy of oneâ€™s home.Â  The abusive conduct is not usually confined to a single\r\n    instance, but rather is a systematic pattern of violence progressively\r\n    escalating and worsening over time.Â  Child victims are often completely\r\n    dependent upon the abuser, unable to defend themselves, and often too young to\r\n    alert anyone to their horrendous plight or ask for help.Â  It is also not\r\n    uncommon for child abuse victims to be so young that they are incapable of\r\n    offering testimony against the abuser.Â  For these reasons, proving the crime of\r\n    child abuse is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nState v. Fletcher, Op. No. 26527 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Aug. 4, 2008)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32 at 26) (Toal, C.J., dissenting).\r\nWhen\r\n  a child is brought to an emergency room with injuries in various stages of\r\n  healing, there is evidence of recurring child abuse.Â  If the multiple, separately\r\n  occurring injuries are not admissible in child abuse prosecutions, the crime\r\n  would be virtually impossible to prove.Â  Martucci and Holder both informed\r\n  hospital personnel and police that Child was injured in a four-wheeler accident\r\n  and that he frequently fell.Â  The prior abuse or neglect at issue was so close\r\n  in time to the infliction of the fatal injuries that the evidence was relevant\r\n  and probative to refute their claims and demonstrate Martucci intended to hurt\r\n  Child.Â  The prior evidence was logically relevant to Martucciâ€™s intent and\r\n  absence of mistake or accident at the time of Childâ€™s death. \r\nb.Â \r\n  Identity\r\nMartucci\r\n  advances he did not abuse Child; instead, he said â€œsheâ€ did it.Â  On the other\r\n  hand, Holder eventually told police that â€œheâ€ abused Child and admitted she did\r\n  nothing to stop it.Â  In order to identify Martucci as the likely perpetrator of\r\n  Childâ€™s injuries, the prior abuse or neglect at issue was relevant to establish\r\n  his identity as the person or one of the persons who fatally abused Child.Â  See State v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996) (finding evidence that\r\n  defendant was the gunman during a robbery was relevant to establish it was the\r\n  defendant who actually killed the victim); State v. Good, 315 S.C. 135,\r\n  432 S.E.2d 463 (1993) (evidence that defendant robbed grandmotherâ€™s home four\r\n  months earlier and the theft of items belonging to her were admissible to\r\n  establish identity of her killer).Â  The fact that Martucci exhibited such\r\n  cruelty and abuse toward Child within a relatively short period of time prior\r\n  to his death circumstantially identified him as Childâ€™s killer.Â  See State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872, 876 (2007).\r\nc.Â \r\n  Common Scheme or Plan\r\nThe\r\n  evidence at issue established a pattern of continuous abuse or neglect\r\n  necessary to prove homicide by child abuse and clearly supported the existence\r\n  of a common scheme or plan, which made it more probable Child was a victim of\r\n  â€œchild abuse or neglect.â€Â  The prior abuse or neglect at issue is highly\r\n  relevant to Martucciâ€™s common scheme or plan rather than his character.Â  The\r\n  evidence showed Martucci followed a pattern of continuous conduct over a period\r\n  of time from June to Childâ€™s death on July 17, making its logical relevance\r\n  apparent and the evidence admissible.Â  See Tutton, 354 S.C. at 329,\r\n  580 S.E.2d at 192.\r\nIn\r\n  the case of the common scheme or plan exception, a close degree of similarity between\r\n  the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant is on trial is\r\n  necessary.Â  State v. Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 95, 480 S.E.2d 77, 80 (1997).Â \r\n  Prior bad act evidence is admissible where the evidence is of such a close\r\n  similarity to the charged offense that the previous act enhances the probative\r\n  value of the evidence so as to outweigh the prejudicial effect.Â  State v.\r\n    Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 114, 456 S.E.2d 390, 392 (1995).Â  The degree of remoteness\r\n  between the other crimes and the one charged is one factor to be considered in\r\n  determining the connection between them.Â  Id.Â  As the similarity becomes\r\n  closer, the more likely the evidence will be admissible.Â  State v. Aiken,\r\n  322 S.C. 177, 180, 470 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œThe acid test of\r\n  admissibility is the logical relevancy of the other crimes.â€Â  State v. Cutro,\r\n  332 S.C. 100, 103, 504 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1998).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  a criminal defendantâ€™s prior bad acts are directed toward the same victim and\r\n  are very similar in nature, those acts are admissible as a common scheme or\r\n  plan.Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. at 471, 523 S.E.2d at 792-93.Â  In Weaverling,\r\n  the defendant repeatedly raped the same child.Â  Id.Â  This Court held the\r\n  defendantâ€™s prior acts were admissible even though the acts were not charged.Â  Id. at 469, 523 S.E.2d at 791.Â  This Court articulated that â€œ[w]here the evidence is\r\n  of such a close similarity to the charged offense that the previous act\r\n  enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule the prejudicial\r\n  effect, it is admissible.â€Â  Id. (citing Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110,\r\n  456 S.E.2d 390).\r\nThe\r\n  present case is distinguishable from State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 485\r\n  S.E.2d 913 (1997).Â  In Pierce, testimony of the defendantâ€™s fellow\r\n  employee about the defendantâ€™s rough treatment of the child one year prior to\r\n  his death was held to be inadmissible under the common scheme or plan exception\r\n  because there was no connection between the prior bad act and the crime of\r\n  homicide by child abuse.Â  However, as with cases of sexual abuse, child abuse\r\n  generally involves the same perpetrator committing abuse against the same\r\n  helpless victim.Â  And where, as here, the perpetrator is the parent or a person\r\n  with exclusive custody and control over the victim, proving the abuse becomes\r\n  extremely difficult.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  result of the difficulties in proving child abuse, â€œevidence which shows a\r\n  pattern of abuse becomes even more probative than it might otherwise be.â€Â  Pierce,\r\n  326 S.C at 182, 485 S.E.2d at 916 (citing State v. McClellan, 283 S.C.\r\n  389, 323 S.E.2d 772 (1984)) (Burnett, J., dissenting).Â  Justice Burnett further\r\n  elaborated: â€œ[c]ontinued illicit intercourse is analogous to a pattern of child\r\n  abuse, and the only difference between [child abuse] and McClellan is\r\n  that this case involved child abuse, not sex abuse.â€Â  Id.\r\nPierce can be reconciled with this case.Â  In Pierce,\r\n  the prior abuse occurred one year before the childâ€™s death.Â  The prior abuse or\r\n  neglect at issue in the case sub judice occurred about a month and a\r\n  half up to a few weeks before Childâ€™s death.Â  The evidence of prior abuse\r\n  against the same victim was not remotely disconnected in time from the conduct\r\n  giving rise to the homicide by child abuse and was part of the same pattern of\r\n  abuse showing extreme indifference to human life.Â  It was logically relevant to\r\n  proving Child died of multiple, non-accidental blunt force injuries and that\r\n  his death was the result of child abuse.Â  There should be no distinction\r\n  between continued illicit intercourse by the same perpetrator against the same\r\n  victim and continued child abuse by the same perpetrator against the same\r\n  victim.Â  The State had the burden of proving that Martucciâ€™s conduct caused Childâ€™s\r\n  death.Â  Because the prior abuse or neglect was probative of a pattern of abuse\r\n  by Martucci against Child, it was admissible under the â€œcommon scheme or planâ€\r\n  exception to Lyle.\r\nd.Â  Clear and Convincing\r\n  Evidence\r\nMartucci\r\n  did not argue at trial that the State failed to show the prior acts by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence.Â  The issue cannot be considered on appeal.Â  See State v. Luckabaugh, 327 S.C. 495, 499, 489 S.E.2d 657, 659 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (issue not preserved when a defendant failed to object to testimony as less\r\n  than clear and convincing); see also Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481\r\n  S.E.2d 118 (an objection must be on a specific ground); State v. Patterson,\r\n  324 S.C. 5, 19, 482 S.E.2d 760, 767 (1997) (an appellant â€œis limited to the grounds\r\n  raised at trialâ€).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  any event, the photographs of Child taken by Veneskyâ€™s husband were\r\n  admissible.Â  The appellate court â€œdoes not conduct a de novo review to\r\n  determine if the evidence is clear and convincing.â€Â  State v. Cheeseboro,\r\n  346 S.C. 526, 546, 552 S.E.2d 300, 310 (2001) (noting that court cannot\r\n  re-revaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence but must simply determine whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is\r\n  supported by any evidence).Â  Here, Parker testified about his direct\r\n  observations of the prior incidents.Â  Further, other witnesses testified about\r\n  the bruises and burns depicted in the photographs.Â  Thus, there was clear and\r\n  convincing evidence of the prior abuse to admit it at trial.Â  The credibility of\r\n  this evidence was for the jury, not this Court, to determine.Â  Id.\r\ne.Â  Res Gestae\r\nEvidence\r\n  of bad acts or other crimes may be admitted under the res gestae theory:\r\n\r\n  One of\r\n    the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes arises\r\n    when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ or is necessary\r\n    to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately connected with and\r\n    explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and is so much a part of\r\n    the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its proof is appropriate in\r\n    order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate\r\n    context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense is â€˜so linked\r\n    together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged that one\r\n    cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] part of\r\n    the res gestae of the crime charged.â€Â  And where evidence is admissible\r\n    to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, â€œ[t]here is no reason to\r\n    fragmentize the event under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (1996)\r\n  (quoting United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980)).Â  The res gestae theory recognizes that evidence of other bad acts may be an\r\n  integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged or may be needed\r\n  to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the crime\r\n  occurred.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001), overruled\r\n    on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494\r\n  (2005); Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435; State v. Adams, 354\r\n  S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Under this theory, it is important\r\n  that the temporal proximity of the prior bad act be closely related to the\r\n  charged crime.Â  Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 480 S.E.2d 77.Â  Even if the evidence\r\n  is relevant under this theory, prior to admission the trial judge should\r\n  determine whether its probative value clearly outweighs any unfair prejudice.\r\n  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Bolden, 303 S.C. 41, 398 S.E.2d 494 (1990).\r\nMartucci\r\n  argues the prior incidents were neither factually nor temporally related to the\r\n  charged crime.Â  In this case, the time period and similarity of the incidents\r\n  involved must be examined overall because of the nature of the crime charged.Â \r\n  The overall view of the facts provides the context in which the crime occurred\r\n  and demonstrates the culminating impact on Child.Â  The incidents were relevant\r\n  to establishing Martucciâ€™s state of mind and whether or not he manifested an\r\n  extreme indifference to human life.Â  The alleged child abuse occurred in the\r\n  month and a half to several weeks before the fatal trauma was inflicted.Â  The\r\n  evidence was necessary to establish the crime charged.Â  Its admission was essential\r\n  and relevant to a full presentation of the evidence in this case.Â  The\r\n  testimony regarding the prior bad acts was relevant to show the complete, whole\r\n  story relating to the charge of homicide by child abuse.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.Â  See Owens,\r\n  346 S.C. at 653, 552 S.E.2d at 753.Â  The trial judge did not err in admitting\r\n  the evidence of alleged prior abuse pursuant to the res gestae doctrine.\r\nIII. Parkerâ€™s\r\n  Â testimony of Martucciâ€™s character\r\nMartucci\r\n  argues the trial judge committed reversible error in allowing Parkerâ€™s\r\n  testimony about his temper and that he had pistols in the house.Â  He contends\r\n  this evidence improperly introduced his bad character to the jury and was\r\n  inadmissible under State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nParker\r\n  witnessed several occasions when Martucci abused Child while he stayed at the\r\n  house.Â  Parker testified that when Martucci abused Child, â€œit would upset me to\r\n  the point to where I would have to walk outside.Â  I couldnâ€™t listen to it\r\n  anymore.â€Â  On direct examination, the Assistant Solicitor asked Parker:\r\n\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Did you ever think about trying to call for help for [Child]?\r\n  Parker: I\r\n    thought about it, yes, maâ€™am.Â  Me and Mr. Martucci hadâ€”we had had conflicts in\r\n    the past.Â  And I knew of his temper from hanging out with him a lotâ€”\r\n  Defense\r\n    Counsel: Your Honor, I would object to any character evidence of Mr. Martucci.\r\n  The\r\n    Court: Iâ€™ll allow this.Â  Go ahead.\r\n  Parker: We\r\n    hadâ€”I knew of his attitude.Â  I knew he had pistols in the house.Â  I knew that\r\n    heâ€”we had had conflicts in the past to the pointâ€”we hadâ€”there was one episode\r\n    in Myrtle Beach to where me and a few friends of mine were down there as well\r\n    asâ€”\r\n  Defense\r\n    Counsel: Your Honor, I hate to objectâ€”\r\n  The\r\n    Court: Yes.Â  This is getting a little bit too far now, Solicitor.\r\n  Assistant\r\n    Solicitor: Your Honor, I will say that this is relevant to his state of mind\r\n    andâ€”\r\n  The\r\n    Court: All right.Â  Iâ€™m going to stop it here.Â  I think itâ€™s gone far enough.Â \r\n    Move on, please.\r\n\r\nParkerâ€™s\r\n  direct examination continued.Â  Parker averred he was afraid of Martucci because\r\n  of prior incidents.Â  Parker noted he was â€œpretty smallâ€ in comparison to\r\n  Martucci.Â  Parker said he did not get help because, â€œI was afraid of him and I\r\n  knew theâ€”what could happen scared me.â€\r\nWhere\r\n  a defendant objects and the objection is sustained but he does not move to\r\n  strike the evidence, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  State\r\n    v. McFadden, 318 S.C. 404, 410, 458 S.E.2d 61, 65 (Ct. App. 1995) (no issue\r\n  is preserved for appeal where the court sustains a partyâ€™s objection to\r\n  improper testimony and the party does not move to strike the testimony); State\r\n    v. Wingo, 304 S.C. 173, 177-78, 403 S.E.2d 322, 325 (Ct. App. 1991) (a\r\n  motion to strike is necessary where a question is answered before an objection\r\n  has been interposed, even though the objection is sustained); see also State\r\n    v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 75, 502 S.E.2d 63, 73, 76 (1998) (any prejudice to\r\n  the defendant could have been removed if the defendant had requested the trial\r\n  judge to strike the objected-to testimony and to give a curative instruction to\r\n  the jury).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, Martucci objected to Parkerâ€™s testimony about the presence of\r\n  guns in the house and a prior incident in Myrtle Beach.Â  The trial judge\r\n  sustained the objection by stating, â€œitâ€™s gone far enough.â€Â  He then instructed\r\n  the Assistant Solicitor to â€œmove on.â€Â  Martucci failed to request the trial\r\n  judge either strike the objectionable testimony or to instruct the jury to\r\n  disregard the reference, and he did not move for a mistrial.Â  His failure to\r\n  request appropriate relief precludes appellate review of this issue.Â  Id.\r\nWhen\r\n  Parker later testified about his fear of Martucci based on prior incidents and\r\n  because he knew â€œwhat could happen to me,â€ there was no objection.Â  Because the\r\n  jury heard this other evidence, the fact they heard the previous testimony was\r\n  not prejudicial to Martucci.Â  See Haselden, 353 S.C. at 196, 577\r\n  S.E.2d at 448 (stating the erroneous admission of prior bad act evidence is\r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if its impact is minimal in the context of\r\n  the entire record); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d\r\n  859, 862 (1993) (finding any error in the admission of evidence cumulative to\r\n  other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).\r\nParkerâ€™s\r\n  testimony was an isolated comment regarding Martucciâ€™s temper and his\r\n  possession of pistols that did not prejudice Martucci.Â  The State did not\r\n  attempt to introduce evidence of any prior convictions or otherwise highlight\r\n  his character in this regard.Â  See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1,\r\n  515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (determining law enforcement agentâ€™s isolated testimony\r\n  that he compared defendantâ€™s fingerprints with a fingerprint card agency had on\r\n  record was not so prejudicial to defendant as to warrant a mistrial because it\r\n  was questionable whether jury drew connection between fingerprint card and\r\n  defendantâ€™s prior criminal activity); State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476\r\n  S.E.2d 903 (1996) (recognizing appellantâ€™s possible drug dealing was merely\r\n  suggested and no testimony was presented concerning such behavior); State v.\r\n    Robinson, 238 S.C. 140, 119 S.E.2d 671 (1961), overruled on other\r\n      grounds by State v.

Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 562, 575 S.E.2d 77, 83 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œNo\r\n  definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and\r\n  prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to\r\n  the entire case.â€Â  Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151.\r\nError\r\n  is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the\r\n  trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897; Mitchell,\r\n  286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 610,\r\n  486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set\r\n  aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  Sherard,\r\n  303 S.C. at 176, 399 S.E.2d at 597; Adams, 354 S.C. at 380-81, 580\r\n  S.E.2d at 795.Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the\r\n  trial is harmless when guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence\r\n  such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey,\r\n  298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).Â  The admission of improper evidence\r\n  is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978); Weaverling,\r\n  337 S.C. at 471, 523 S.E.2d at 793; see also State v. Williams,\r\n  321 S.C. 455, 463, 469 S.E.2d 49, 54 (1996) (instructing that error in\r\n  admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence\r\n  which is properly admitted).\r\nThere\r\n  was overwhelming and independent evidence of Martucciâ€™s guilt.Â  Parker\r\n  testified about Martucciâ€™s prior abuse of Child and that Martucci was the last\r\n  person with Child before he died.Â  Martucci lied to the police and hospital\r\n  personnel about the cause of Childâ€™s injuries.Â  Holder told the police about\r\n  Martucciâ€™s physical abuse of Child just before his death.Â  This evidence,\r\n  together with other physical evidence in this case, clearly demonstrates\r\n  Martucciâ€™s guilt of homicide by child abuse was conclusively proven by\r\n  competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion could be reached.Â \r\n  Given this substantial and overwhelming evidence of Martucciâ€™s guilt, the\r\n  challenged evidence was cumulative and its admission is not a ground for\r\n  reversal.Â  Baccus, 367 S.C. at 55-56, 625 S.E.2d at 224; Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795.\r\nThere\r\n  was other evidence demonstrating Parkerâ€™s fear of Martucci which was admitted\r\n  without objection.Â  Deputy Wesley Smith interviewed Parker at the law\r\n  enforcement center on the day of Childâ€™s death.Â  Smith testified Parker â€œwas\r\n  cooperative.Â  He really acted like he was scared of Mr. Martucci and what his\r\n  involvement in the case would be and what would happen to him.â€Â  Smith vouched\r\n  Parker â€œwas always kind of hesitantâ€ about answering questions.Â  He advanced\r\n  Parker â€œcried someâ€ during the interview because he told him that he was afraid\r\n  of Martucci.Â  See State v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 498, 381 S.E.2d\r\n  732, 733 (1989) (stating admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is\r\n  merely cumulative to other evidence); Broaddus, 361 S.C. at 542, 605\r\n  S.E.2d at 583-84 (holding error in admission of drug evidence was harmless\r\n  where it was cumulative to other unobjected-to testimony at trial regarding\r\n  drug use and drug dealing); State v. Richardson, 358 S.C. 586, 596-97,\r\n  595 S.E.2d 858, 863 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that even if the challenged\r\n  testimony constituted improper â€œcharacter evidence,â€ any error in its admission\r\n  was harmless where the testimony was cumulative to other similar testimony that\r\n  was admitted without objection); see also State v. Brown, 344\r\n  S.C. 70, 75, 543 S.E.2d 552, 555 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding any error in\r\n  admitting evidence of murder defendantâ€™s violent character was harmless as\r\n  properly admitted evidence of the defendantâ€™s use of force during his argument\r\n  with victim the previous day clearly demonstrated defendantâ€™s propensity to\r\n  become violent).\r\nIf\r\n  the admission of Parkerâ€™s testimony was erroneous, it was clearly harmless\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt because its impact was minimal in context of the\r\n  entire record.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the trial court properly admitted autopsy photographs which were relevant\r\n  to prove Child was abused, that the abuse was the cause of his death, and the\r\n  abuse manifested an extreme indifference to human life, all of which support\r\n  the charge for which Martucci was under indictment.Â  The evidence of Martucciâ€™s\r\n  prior abuse of Child was admissible to show intent, the identity of the abuser,\r\n  the absence of mistake or accident, and a common scheme or plan of abuse.Â  We determine\r\n  any error in the admission of Parkerâ€™s testimony about Martucciâ€™s character is\r\n  not preserved.Â  Had the issue been preserved, the testimony would be cumulative\r\n  to unobjected-to testimony and concomitantly harmless.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Martucciâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4439","title":"Bickerstaff v.

Â We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants entered\r\n  into a contract with Prevost for interior remodeling of their home.Â  The home\r\n  experienced significant water damage when a broken water line to the washing\r\n  machine flooded the first floor of the residence.Â  Thereafter, Appellants\r\n  brought an action against Prevost alleging negligence and breach of implied\r\n  warranty of workmanship as a part of the remodeling work.Â  Prevost answered\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ complaint, and counterclaimed for breach of contract, implied\r\n  contract/quantum meruit, and foreclosure of its previously filed mechanicâ€™s\r\n  lien. Â Included in Prevostâ€™s counterclaims was a request for interest on any\r\n  payment due pursuant to the contract, at the agreed-upon â€œdaily rate of 1%.â€ \r\nA jury trial\r\n  resulted in a verdict in favor of Prevost in the amount of $6,437.62. Â After\r\n  the jury had been excused, Prevost made a post-trial motion for attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  and prejudgment interest under the contract.Â  The contractual provision at\r\n  issue stated:Â  â€œPayment due under this Contract but not paid shall incur a\r\n  daily interest rate of 1% from the date the payment is due.â€Â  The circuit court\r\n  took the matter under advisement and then issued an order awarding Prevost\r\n  prejudgment interest as defined under the contract.Â  The award of prejudgment\r\n  interest is the only issue before us on appeal. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Entitlement to\r\n  Prejudgment Interest/Question of Fact for the Jury\r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the issue of prejudgment interest was a question of fact that should have been\r\n  submitted to the jury.Â  Additionally, Appellants contend the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  award of prejudgment interest to Prevost under the contract was in error.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nInitially, we note\r\n  neither party appears to have argued during the presentation of evidence that\r\n  the issue of prejudgment interest should be submitted to the jury.Â  The circuit\r\n  court issued a post-judgment order granting Prevost prejudgment interest as\r\n  specified in the contract, but did not make a finding as to whether the\r\n  prejudgment interest was a question of law or fact.[1]Â \r\n  Appellants made no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment\r\n  requesting the court rule on its finding.Â  However, Appellantsâ€™ argument also\r\n  fails on the merits.Â  It is well settled in this state that the award of\r\n  prejudgment interest is a function of the trial court, and has never been held\r\n  to be an issue of fact requiring its submission in a jury trial.Â  See Smith-Hunter\r\n    Constr. Co. v. Hopson, 365 S.C. 125, 616 S.E.2d 419 (2005); Babb v.\r\n      Rothrock, 310 S.C. 350, 426 S.E.2d 789 (1993).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina law permits\r\n  prejudgment interest on obligations to pay money from the time when, either by\r\n  agreement of the parties or operation of law, the payment is demandable and if\r\n  the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty.Â  Smith-Hunter,\r\n  365 S.C. at 128, 616 S.E.2d at 421 (citing Babb v. Rothrock, 310 S.C.\r\n  350, 426 S.E.2d 789 (1993)). Â As explained in a recent supreme court case, â€œprejudgment interest is allowed on a claim of\r\n  liquidated damages; i.e., the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to\r\n  certainty based on a mathematical calculation previously\r\n  agreed to by the parties . . . [t]he fact that the amount due is disputed by\r\n  the opposing party does not render the claim unliquidated for the purposes of\r\n  an award of prejudgment interest.â€Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 133,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 252, 258-59 (2006). Â Thus, â€œ[t]he proper test for determining\r\n  whether prejudgment interest may be awarded is whether or not the measure of\r\n  recovery, not necessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions\r\n  existing at the time the claim arose.â€ Â Smith-Hunter, 365 S.C. at 128,\r\n  616 S.E.2d at 421.\r\nHere, Appellants\r\n  and Prevost entered into a contract found by the circuit court to be for a\r\n  definite amount of $27,865; therefore, the measure of recovery was fixed by\r\n  conditions existing at the time the claim arose.Â  It is of no consequence that\r\n  each party claimed damages under the contract, or that the jury returned a\r\n  verdict for less than the liquidated damages requested by Prevost.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find the circuit court properly considered the applicable law on prejudgment\r\n  interest, and was correct in its determination that Prevost is entitled to\r\n  interest on the amount of damages awarded by the jury. \r\nII. Consumer Protection\r\n  Code Prohibits the Interest Rate under the Contract; Interest Rate Is Punitive\r\n  In Nature, and Violates the Constitution and the Public Policy of This State\r\nAppellants\r\n  next contend the South Carolina Consumer Protection Code prohibits the imposition\r\n  of interest in excess of twelve percent per annum.Â  Additionally, they maintain\r\n  the award of interest at the rate of one percent per day was grossly\r\n  disproportionate to the amount of the principal, making it punitive in nature,\r\n  and violative of the United States Constitution and the public policy of this\r\n  state.Â  Appellants present these arguments for the very first time on appeal.Â \r\n  As a result, they were not ruled upon by the circuit court, and are not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 5\r\n  S.E.2d 187 (1939) (stating the questions presented for appellate review must\r\n  first have been fairly and properly raised in the circuit court and passed upon\r\n  by that court); see also State v. Powers, 331 S.C. 37, 501\r\n  S.E.2d 116 (1998) (finding constitutional arguments are no exception to the\r\n  rule, and if not raised to the trial court are deemed waived on appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED.[2] \r\nKONDUROS, J.,\r\n  concurs.Â  SHORT, J., concurs in part, dissents in part in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., (concurring in part, dissenting in part):Â  I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part.\r\nI agree with the majority that Appellantsâ€™ Consumer\r\n  Protection Code and constitutional arguments are not preserved for review.Â \r\n  However, I find the issue of whether the prejudgment interest should have been\r\n  presented to the jury is not preserved for review.[3]Â  Furthermore, I would\r\n  remand the action for the trial court to set the amount of prejudgment\r\n  interest.\r\nAs noted by the\r\n  majority in footnote 2, the issue of the amount of interest due is still\r\n  unsettled.Â  As there is something remaining to be done prior to full resolution\r\n  of this case, I would remand to the Honorable Deadra L. Jefferson for a hearing\r\n  to determine the amount of prejudgment interest to award Prevost. Â See TranSouth\r\n    Finâ€™l Corp. v. Cochran, 324 S.C. 290, 297, 478 S.E.2d 63, 66-67 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) (remanding for an additional hearing to determine the amount of the final\r\n  judgment where the parties disputed, inter alia, the prejudgment\r\n  interest due on an undisputed principal amount due).Â  See generally Adams\r\n    v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 303 S.C. 251, 255,\r\n  399 S.E.2d 788, 790 (Ct. App. 1990) (remanding case due to legal error because\r\n  agency failed to make critical findings).\r\nThe\r\n  inequity arising from an award of prejudgment interest calculated by\r\n  multiplying one percent of the judgment by 725, as is the case here as\r\n  calculated by the majority, and the partiesâ€™ confusion as to the amount of the\r\n  judgment including prejudgment interest, requires me to respectfully concur in\r\npart and dissent in part.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It is presumably implicit in its order granting\r\ninterest that the court found this issue to be a question of law.\r\n[2] We note this court is not blind to the inequity that\r\n  results from the imposition of the rate of one percent daily interest on this\r\n  jury award.Â  The circuit court found interest was due under the contract\r\n  beginning on June 1, 2004, a finding that was not appealed, and the jury award\r\n  of $6,437.62 in damages occurred 725 days later, on May 26, 2006.Â  If the\r\n  provision is interpreted to provide prejudgment interest on any payment due\r\n  under the contract as a one percent daily penalty fee, i.e. taking an amount of\r\n  one percent of the award due each day according to the circuit courtâ€™s order,\r\n  then the prejudgment interest due on the award would be $46,672.75 (calculated\r\n  simply by multiplying one percent of the award by 725).Â  However, if the\r\n  provision is interpreted to provide daily one percent compounding interest, then the prejudgment interest due on the award would be $8,744,225.12\r\n  (calculated by multiplying the $6,437.62 award, by 1.01 to the 725th power).Â \r\n  The circuit courtâ€™s order does not set out a method for calculating the\r\n  interest, nor does it quote the actual dollar interest award.Â  Appellants\r\n  estimate the interest at $60,000-plus, failing to explain how they arrived at\r\n  that number, and Prevost does not state a number in its brief.Â  Although the\r\n  contractual interest rate term itself is potentially ambiguous, as opposed to\r\n  the academic argument of entitlement to prejudgment interest, and although a\r\n  court could find alternatively that the term is unconscionable or would lead to\r\n  an absurd result, we are nonetheless confronted with the insurmountable\r\n  obstacle that Appellants neither made these arguments below, nor presented them\r\n  to us on appeal.Â  See Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n  526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (stating an appellate court may affirm for any reason\r\n  appearing in the record, but may reverse only for a reason raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court and argued on appeal); see also Langley\r\n    v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 181, 325 S.E.2d 550, 561 (Ct. App. 1984) revâ€™d\r\n      on other grounds, 286 S.C. 85, 332 S.E.2d 100 (1985) (â€œ[A]ppellate courts\r\n  in this state, like well-behaved children, do not speak unless spoken to and do\r\n  not answer questions they are not asked.â€); contra State v. Forrester,\r\n  343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001) (addressing an issue sua sponte); 15 SC\r\n  Juris Appeal and Error Â§Â§71-73 (1992 and Supp. 2007) (outlining the rules and\r\nexceptions for preserving and presenting error for appellate review).Â  \r\n[3] After the jury returned its verdict, Appellants\r\n  argued the prejudgment interest rate was a matter for the jury.Â  The trial\r\n  judge stated:Â  â€œI am inclined to believe, although Iâ€™m not fixed in that\r\n  opinion, that the one percent that would be due on the debt is a matter of law\r\n  for the Court.â€Â  The judge required the parties to submit orders on the issue\r\n  of, inter alia, prejudgment interest.Â  In the final order, the court\r\n  concluded Prevost was entitled to prejudgment interest at the contract rate\r\n  without ruling on the issue of whether the interest should have been decided by\r\n  the jury.Â  Appellants filed no post-trial motions.Â  See Elam v. South\r\n    Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004)\r\n  (stating a party must file a motion to reconsider when an issue has been\r\n  raised, but not ruled on, to preserve issue for appellate review).\r\n[4] I recognize parties are free to contract for higher\r\n  interest rates within legal limits.Â  See Taylor, Cotton &amp;\r\n    Ridley, Inc. v. Okatie Hotel Group, 372 S.C. 89, 99, 641 S.E.2d 459, 464\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  However, the prejudgment interest rate here is clearly beyond\r\n  any legal rate of interest and is unconscionable.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (setting legal rate of interest on accounts stated at 8.75 percent\r\n  per annum).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
