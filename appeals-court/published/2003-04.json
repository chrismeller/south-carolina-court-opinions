Peeples, Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3621\r\nHeard March 12, 2003 â€“ Filed April \r\n  7, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRobert T. Williams, Sr., of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\nW. Lawrence Brown and Robert M. Bell, both of Langley, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds \r\n  brought an action seeking to enjoin the Aiken County Clerk of Court from assessing \r\n  a $150 fee for each license their bondsmen possessed.Â  After a non-jury proceeding, \r\n  the circuit court refused to enjoin the Clerk of Court from charging the fee.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGeorgia-Carolina Bail Bonds (â€œCarolinaâ€) \r\n  is a corporation organized, incorporated, and doing business in Aiken County \r\n  pursuant to the laws of South Carolina.Â Â  Carolina employs several surety bondsmen \r\n  who operate as agents for multiple insurance companies that guarantee the bonds \r\n  they write.Â  The bondsmen have an independent license for each insurance company \r\n  for which they are an agent.Â  These separate licenses are filed with the Aiken \r\n  County Clerk of Court.Â  The Clerk of Court is required to process, file, and \r\n  record additional documents for each filed license.Â  The Clerk of Court collects \r\n  licensing fees pursuant to South Carolina law.Â  The Clerk of Court collects \r\n  $150 dollars annually for each license held by Carolinaâ€™s bondsmen.\r\nCarolina filed an action seeking to enjoin \r\n  the Clerk of Court from collecting $150 for each individual license held by \r\n  a bondsman, arguing South Carolina law only empowers the Clerk of Court to charge \r\n  $150 a year per individual holding a license, not for each individual license.Â  \r\n  The parties agreed to a non-jury trial on the pleadings and stipulated to the \r\n  facts of the case.Â  The circuit court denied the injunction, ruling that the \r\n  statute enables the Clerk of Court to collect $150 for each license held by \r\n  a bondsman.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes S.C. Code Ann. section 38-53-100(D) \r\n  authorize the Clerk of Court to collect only $150 per year per individual or \r\n  $150 per year per license held by that individual?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCarolina argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it denied its action to enjoin the Aiken County Clerk of Court because \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. section 38-53-100(D) only entitles the Clerk of Court to collect \r\n  $150 dollars for each bondsman who holds a license and not $150 for each license \r\n  a bondsman holds.Â  We agree.\r\nI.Â  Statutory Construction\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation \r\n  is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.Â  State v. Scott, 351 S.C. \r\n  584, 588, 571 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2002); City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 \r\n  S.C. 556, 560, 486 S.E.2d 492, 494 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Olson \r\n  v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 205, 544 S.E.2d 38, 44 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe quintessence of statutory construction is legislative \r\n  intent.â€).Â  A statute should be given a reasonable and practical construction \r\n  consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the statute.Â  Davis v. \r\n  NationsCredit Fin. Servs. Corp., 326 S.C. 83, 484 S.E.2d 471 (1997); Daisy \r\n  Outdoor Adver. Co. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 352 S.C. 113, 120, \r\n  572 S.E.2d 462, 466 (Ct. App. 2002); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 \r\n  S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  All rules of statutory construction \r\n  are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be \r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed \r\n  in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  Ray Bell Constr. Co. \r\n  v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998); \r\n  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002); State \r\n  v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The determination \r\n  of legislative intent is a matter of law.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; \r\n  Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995); Olson, \r\n  344 S.C. at 207, 544 S.E.2d at 45.\r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained \r\n  primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  Morgan, 352 S.C. at \r\n  366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Stephen, 324 S.C. at 339, 478 S.E.2d at 77.Â  \r\n  The language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject \r\n  matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. v. Leatherman, \r\n  309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d \r\n  at 206; Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582.Â  The courtâ€™s primary \r\n  function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General \r\n  Assembly.Â  Smith, 350 S.C. at 87, 564 S.E.2d at 361.Â  A statute must \r\n  receive a practical and reasonable interpretation consistent with the â€œdesignâ€ \r\n  of the legislature.Â  Id.Â  &quot;Once the legislature has made [a] choice, \r\n  there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment based upon their \r\n  own notions of public policy.&quot;Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nWhen faced with an undefined statutory \r\n  term, the court must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary \r\n  meaning.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, \r\n  504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); Adoptive Parents v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. \r\n  535, 446 S.E.2d 404 (1994); Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 581; \r\n  see also Santee Cooper Resort v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, \r\n  298 S.C. 179, 184, 379 S.E.2d 119, 122 (1989) (â€œWords used in a statute should \r\n  be taken in their ordinary and popular significance unless there is something \r\n  in the statute requiring a different interpretation.â€).Â  Dictionaries can be \r\n  helpful tools during the initial stages of legal research for the purpose of \r\n  defining statutory terms.Â  Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for City of Beaufort, \r\n  346 S.C. 401, 552 S.E.2d 42 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The terms must be construed in \r\n  context and their meaning determined by looking at the other terms used in the \r\n  statute.Â  S. Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Windstorm &amp; Hail \r\n  Underwriting Assâ€™n, 306 S.C. 339, 412 S.E.2d 377 (1991); Hudson, \r\n  336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 581.Â  Courts should consider not merely the language \r\n  of the particular clause being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction \r\n  with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  Whitner \r\n  v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997); Morgan, 352 S.C. at \r\n  366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; see also Stephen, 324 S.C. at 340, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d at 77 (Statutory provisions should be given reasonable and practical \r\n  construction consistent with the purpose of the entire act).Â  Statutes must \r\n  be read as a whole and sections which are part of the same general statutory \r\n  scheme must be construed together and given effect, if it can be done by any \r\n  reasonable construction.Â  Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  799 (1992).\r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is unambiguous and clear, \r\n  there is no need to employ the rules of statutory construction and this Court \r\n  has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Paschal v. State Election \r\n  Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); Cowan v. Allstate Ins. Co., \r\n  351 S.C. 626, 631, 571 S.E.2d 715, 717 (Ct. App. 2002); Olson, 344 S.C. \r\n  at 207, 544 S.E.2d at 45; see also Brassell, 326 S.C. at 561, \r\n  486 S.E.2d at 495 (â€œWhere the language of the statute is clear and explicit, \r\n  the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it which are not \r\n  in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€).Â  When the terms of a statute are clear, the \r\n  court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  Cooper \r\n  v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002); Holley v. Mount \r\n  Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994); Carolina Alliance \r\n  for Fair Employment v. S.C.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, \r\n  542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct.

Berkeley County, 348 S.C. \r\n  224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (â€œ[W]here a statute is ambiguous, the Court \r\n  must construe the terms of the statute.â€).Â  An ambiguity in a statute should \r\n  be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial, and equitable operation of the law.Â  \r\n  Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at 582; Brassell, 326 S.C. \r\n  at 561; 486 S.E.2d at 495; City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue \r\n  Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In construing \r\n  a statute, the court looks to the language as a whole in light of its manifest \r\n  purpose.Â  State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162, 573 S.E.2d 783 (2002); Adams \r\n  v.

Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-100(D) (2002).\r\nAlthough not binding or controlling, this \r\n  court gives deference to the opinion of a state agency charged with the duty \r\n  and responsibility of enforcing a state statute.Â  The South Carolina Department \r\n  of Insurance is given general oversight responsibility in regard to the licensing \r\n  of a bondsman.Â  Willie Seawright, the Licensing Coordinator for the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Insurance, who is not an attorney, has offered his interpretation \r\n  that â€œ[t]his charge can only be assessed one time a year, regardless of the \r\n  number of licenses that a bondsman register [sic] in your county.â€Â  Additionally, \r\n  David K. Avant, Assistant Attorney General, opined: â€œIt is also my opinion that \r\n  each person licensed under Chapter 53 of Title 38 is subjected to one fee under \r\n  Section 38-53-100(D), no matter how many licenses that person holds.â€\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized the \r\n  rule that an opinion or construction of a statute by an agency that is in charge \r\n  of enforcing the statute should be given great deference.Â  &quot;[T]he construction \r\n  of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded \r\n  the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling \r\n  reasons.&quot;Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n  348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002) (quoting Dunton v. South Carolina \r\n  Bd. of Examiners in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987)); \r\n  see also Nucor Steel, a Div. of Nucor Corp. v. South Carolina Public \r\n  Serv. Commâ€™n, 310 S.C. 539, 543, 426 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1992) (â€œWhere an agency \r\n  is charged with the execution of a statute, the agency's interpretation should \r\n  not be overruled without cogent reason.â€); Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 337 S.C. \r\n  476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe circuit court established that â€œlicenseeâ€ meant \r\n  â€œone to whom a license is granted.â€Â  The circuit court also noted that the legislature \r\n  did not intend to apply the fee to the individual bondsman or it would have \r\n  used the term â€œbondsmanâ€ exactly as it did in the following sentence of the \r\n  statute.Â  In examining the legislative purpose of the statute, the circuit court \r\n  found the intent of the legislature was to\r\n\r\ncreate a system whereby fees would be generated to offset \r\n  the expense of registering and monitoring the qualifications of bail bondsmen \r\n  and runners in a given county. . . . Additionally, the court finds that the \r\n  increased time and effort required to maintain records and supervise bondsmen \r\n  with multiple licenses warrants a separate charge for each license that the \r\n  bondsman holds in the county.Â  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court felt such a ruling was equitable because \r\n  â€œ[a]llowing the Clerk to collect only one fee for [the] registration of multiple \r\n  licenses for an individual bondsman would not be logical or fair.Â  Bondsmen \r\n  with multiple licenses would pay a proportionately smaller fee for registration \r\n  of each license than would a bondsman with a single license.â€\r\nWe disagree with the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation \r\n  of the statute.Â  The term licensee encapsulates both bondsmen and runners as \r\n  evidenced by the second passage in the statute.Â  The statute directs a bondsman \r\n  operating in another county to pay a $100 fee without regard to the number of \r\n  licenses he or she holds.Â  If the legislature had intended for the fee to be \r\n  $150 for each license, the legislature could have articulated this requisite \r\n  with exactitude.Â  Instead, the statute as written requires a licensee to pay \r\n  $150 to the clerk without specific reference to any number of licenses a bondsman \r\n  or a runner holds.Â  We acknowledge that the legislative purpose of the statute \r\n  is to obtain fees to defray the costs of monitoring and licensing bondsmen.Â  \r\n  However, the legislature, in penning this statute, had sound reasons for circumscription \r\n  of the fee to the licensee.Â  An obvious legislative policy response \r\n  was that an open-ended per license charge would make the process expensive for \r\n  a bondsman to enter and remain in the profession.Â  In any event, it is not necessary \r\n  to bestow the rules of statutory interpretation because it is clear that the \r\n  term licensee encompasses bondsman and the statute only orders \r\n  the licensee to pay $150 to the clerk without any mention of the number of individual \r\n  licenses the licensee holds.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUtilizing the â€œplain meaningâ€ rule of \r\n  statutory construction, we hold that S.C. Code Ann. section 38-53-100(D) requires \r\n  a bondsman to pay the $150 fee as a licensee and does not require \r\n  an additional fee for each license the bondsman owns.Â  The circuit court erred \r\n  when it denied Carolinaâ€™s action to enjoin the Clerk from assessing a $150 fee \r\n  for each license a bondsman has.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court \r\n  is \r\n REVERSED.\r\n HUFF, J., and MOREHEAD, Acting Judge, \r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3622","title":"State v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  3622\r\nHeard February 25, 2003 â€“ Filed April 7, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, \r\n  of the SC Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief \r\n  Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General \r\n  Charles H. Richardson, Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, of Columbia;Â  \r\n  and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Jimmy Dodd was indicted for \r\n  the armed robbery of a convenience store.Â  The trial judge denied his motion \r\n  for directed verdict, and the jury found Dodd guilty of armed robbery.Â  He was \r\n  sentenced to life without parole.Â  Dodd appeals, arguing the state failed to \r\n  prove the corpus delecti [1]  of armed robbery aliunde [2]  his confession.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nAt trial, the State produced evidence that Dodd entered \r\n  a Liâ€™l Cricket store and told the clerk to get down on the floor or he would \r\n  kill her. The clerk testified that she did not know what Dodd was going to kill \r\n  her with and that the only thing she saw in his hand was a rolled up t-shirt. \r\n  The State also presented the following statement from the defendant:\r\n\r\nI just want to see that lady at Liâ€™L Cricket and hug \r\n  her and apologize to her for coming in the store and robbing her on Monday night.Â  \r\n  I did not mean to hurt her and never pointed the gun at her.Â  I just \r\n  threatened her to scare her.Â  I took my shirt off right before I walked in the \r\n  store because I was hot and was on drugs.Â  Iâ€™ve had a drug problem and I feel \r\n  like it controls everything I do. (emphasis added)\r\n\r\nThe defense moved for a directed verdict, and the motion \r\n  was denied. The jury found Dodd guilty of armed robbery. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDodd argues that his motion for \r\n  directed verdict should have been granted because the Stateâ€™s evidence failed \r\n  to provide sufficient evidence aliunde his confession of the corpus \r\n  delicti of armed robbery.\r\nThe â€œcorroboration \r\n  ruleâ€ requires that extra-judicial confessions of a defendant be corroborated \r\n  by proof aliunde of the corpus delicti.Â  State v. Osborne, \r\n  335 S.C. 172, 175, 516 S.E.2d 201, 202 (1999).Â Â Â  â€œThe [rule] is satisfied if \r\n  the State provides sufficient independent evidence which serves to corroborate \r\n  the defendantâ€™s extra-judicial statements and, together with such statements, \r\n  permits a reasonable belief that the crime occurred.â€Â  Id. at 180, 516 \r\n  S.E.2d at 205.Â  \r\nâ€œ[G]enerally speaking, \r\n  the term â€˜corpus delictiâ€™ means, when applied to any particular offense, \r\n  that the specific crime has actually been committed.â€Â  State v. Teal, \r\n  225 S.C. 472, 474, 82 S.E.2d 787, 788 (1954) (citations omitted).Â  The State \r\n  may prove the corpus delicti of armed robbery by establishing that a \r\n  robbery was committed and either one of two additional elements: (1) that the \r\n  robber was armed with a deadly weapon or (2) that the robber alleged he was \r\n  armed with a deadly weapon, either by action or words, while using a representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon or any object.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2001); State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 268-269, 559 S.E.2d 847, \r\n  849 (2002).Â  \r\nConsidering the second prong \r\n  first, we note that although Dodd threatened to kill the store clerk, he never \r\n  alleged that he was armed nor used an item to represent a deadly weapon.Â  Therefore, \r\n  this prong of the statute was not satisfied.\r\nThe question, then, is whether \r\n  Doddâ€™s admission that he had a gun coupled with the clerkâ€™s testimony that he \r\n  threatened to kill her, satisfied the first prong of the statute, which requires \r\n  that the State prove Dodd was armed with a deadly weapon.Â  We believe that it \r\n  does.\r\nOnce Dodd confessed to having \r\n  a gun during the commission of his robbery, the State only needed to present \r\n  sufficient independent evidence to corroborate those statements so that a jury \r\n  could reasonably believe an armed robbery occurred.Â  See Osborne. \r\n  335 S.C. at 180, 516 S.E.2d at 205; see also State v. Trexler, \r\n  342 S.E.2d 878, 880 (N.C. 1986) (finding that the corroboration rule only requires \r\n  the Stateâ€™s independent evidence to â€œtouch or be concerned with the corpus \r\n  delictiâ€ and, standing alone, it need not prove any element of the crime).Â  \r\n\r\nHere, Doddâ€™s confession to having \r\n  a gun was corroborated by his threat to the clerk that he would kill her if \r\n  she did not do as he told her.Â  Although his threat, unaccompanied by any representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon, would not independently be sufficient to establish \r\n  the element of a deadly weapon, the threat is sufficient to corroborate \r\n  Doddâ€™s confession to being armed.Â  See Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264 at \r\n  268, 559 S.E.2d at 849 (holding that the State did not sufficiently prove the \r\n  defendant was armed when the only evidence against him was that he handed a \r\n  clerk a note that read: â€œGive me all your cash or Iâ€™ll shoot you,â€ and there \r\n  was no confession to having a gun).Â  When there is any evidence tending to establish \r\n  the corpus delicti of a crime, it is the trial judgeâ€™s duty to pass that \r\n  question to the jury.Â  See Osborne, 335 S.C. at 180, 516 S.E.2d \r\n  at 205; State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 381, 385, 468 S.E.2d 656, 658 (1996).Â  \r\n  Therefore, the trial judge did not err in denying Doddâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict.\r\nAccordingly, \r\n  Doddâ€™s conviction for armed robbery is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY \r\n  and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] â€œThe body of a crime.â€ Blackâ€™s \r\n    Law Dictionary 344 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] â€œFrom another source.â€ Id. \r\n    at 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3623","title":"Fields v.

McKay, II and Kathleen Devereaux Schultz, \r\n  both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Vergie Fields brought an \r\n  action individually and on behalf of her husbandâ€™s estate against Orangeburg \r\n  Regional Medical Center (â€œhospitalâ€) and Dr. Simons Hane for wrongful death \r\n  and medical malpractice. Fields claimed the hospital and Hane were negligent \r\n  and committed medical malpractice leading to her husbandâ€™s death.Â  During the \r\n  trial, the circuit court excluded the testimony of one of Fieldsâ€™s experts regarding \r\n  his credentials.Â  Additionally, the circuit court refused to allow Fields to \r\n  use a treatise to cross-examine Hane.Â  Fields argues these are reversible errors \r\n  which entitle her to a new trial. Â We reverse and remand for a new trial.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn September 14, 1994, Thomas Fields called \r\n  his wife, Vergie Fields, at her job and asked her to take him to the hospital \r\n  because he was experiencing severe chest pains, which radiated down into both \r\n  arms.Â  Fields was a forty-nine-year-old smoker with a family history of heart \r\n  disease.Â  In 1976, Fields became disabled when he received severe injuries from \r\n  falling at work.Â  From 1976 to 1994, Fields suffered from a variety of physical \r\n  and psychiatric ailments and made numerous trips to the emergency room at the \r\n  hospital.Â  He was hospitalized several times to treat his psychiatric problems \r\n  during this period.\r\nFields had previously experienced bouts \r\n  of chest pain.Â  From 1981 until his death in 1994, the hospital performed fifteen \r\n  EKGs on Fields.Â  In 1993, Fieldsâ€™s doctor arranged a cardiac catheterization \r\n  to evaluate whether Fields had coronary artery disease.Â  The results were negative \r\n  and were in Fieldsâ€™s files at the hospitalâ€™s emergency room.\r\nWhen Fields arrived at the hospitalâ€™s \r\n  emergency room on September 14, 1994, Dr. Fisher saw him.Â  Fisher ran an EKG \r\n  and ordered a chest X-Ray, which read normal.Â  Fisher diagnosed Fields with \r\n  gastrointestinal reflux and chronic back pain.Â  Fisher prescribed Fields a G.I. \r\n  cocktail, which was administered in the emergency room, and advised Fields to \r\n  consult his family doctor.Â  Before Fields left, he informed Fisher the G.I. \r\n  cocktail had provided some relief.Â  Fields saw his psychiatrist the same week \r\n  and made an appointment to see his family physician the following week.\r\nOn September 18, 1994, Fields awoke during \r\n  the early morning hours once again hurting from severe chest pain, which radiated \r\n  down both arms.Â  Fields went to the hospitalâ€™s emergency room in the middle \r\n  of the night where Hane examined him.Â  When Fields arrived, he asked Hane for \r\n  another G.I. cocktail.Â  Fields was in so much pain on this occasion that he \r\n  was sobbing.Â  Hane ran an EKG and reviewed the results from the X-Ray and EKG \r\n  from September 14th as well as the other records contained within \r\n  Fieldsâ€™s file, including the results of the 1993 catheterization.Â  The hospital \r\n  placed Fields on a heart monitor for approximately forty-five minutes to an \r\n  hour.Â  The monitor kept track of Fieldsâ€™s cardiac activity during that time, \r\n  all of which appeared normal.Â  Hane diagnosed Fields with histrionics and gastrointestinal \r\n  pain.Â  Fields received a G.I. cocktail and a shot of Vistaril and Nubain to \r\n  treat the histrionics. Â Hane released Fields at 3:50 a.m. and instructed \r\n  him to return to the emergency room if the condition persisted or worsened and \r\n  to consult his family physician.\r\nWhen Fields and his wife left the \r\n  hospital, his pain intensified one or two miles away from the hospital.Â  They \r\n  stopped for a drink at a gas station and decided to drive to the Palmetto Baptist \r\n  Hospital in downtown Columbia, about forty-five minutes away.Â  When they reached \r\n  Baptist, Vergie Fields informed the emergency room staff that she thought her \r\n  husband was having a heart attack.Â  The Baptist emergency physicians performed \r\n  an EKG which confirmed Fields was having a heart attack.Â  The cardiologist at \r\n  Baptist decided not to treat Fields with clot buster drugs but instead had Fields \r\n  transported by helicopter to Providence Hospital to have an emergency cardiac \r\n  catheterization performed.Â  While undergoing the procedure, one of Fieldsâ€™s \r\n  coronary arteries dissected, a known risk of the procedure.Â  He died shortly \r\n  thereafter.\r\nVergie Fields brought a wrongful death \r\n  suit against the hospital andÂ  Hane, contending they were negligent and committed \r\n  medical malpractice by failing to admit Fields on September 18th.Â  \r\n  The case went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the hospital \r\n  and Hane.Â  Vergie Fields appeals, alleging the circuit court erred by not admitting \r\n  testimony regarding the credentials of one of her expert witnesses and failing \r\n  to allow her to use a treatise during Haneâ€™s cross-examination.Â  After Vergie \r\n  Fields filed this appeal, she reached a settlement with the hospital.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Expert Witness Qualifications\r\nIn order for a plaintiff to recover for \r\n  medical malpractice, he must illustrate the physician failed to exercise the \r\n  degree of care and skill which is ordinarily employed by the profession under \r\n  similar conditions and like circumstances.Â  Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. \r\n  331, 333, 440 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct. App. 1993); Bonaparte v. Floyd, 291 \r\n  S.C. 427, 434, 354 S.E.2d 40, 45 (Ct. App. 1987); Welch v. Whitaker, \r\n  282 S.C. 251, 258, 317 S.E.2d 758, 763 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  This must be established \r\n  by expert testimony unless the subject matter is of common knowledge or experience.Â  \r\n  Bramlette v. Charter-Med.-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 72, 393 S.E.2d 914, \r\n  916 (1990); Pederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 142, 341 S.E.2d 633, 634 \r\n  (1986); Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 192, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1978); \r\n  Bonaparte, 291 S.C. at 434, 354 S.E.2d at 45; 61 Am. Jur. 2d Physicians, \r\n  Surgeons Â§ 318 (2002).Â  \r\nQualification of an expert and the admission or \r\n  exclusion of his testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  court, whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 60-61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211 (1998); Means \r\n  v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 166, 558 S.E.2d 921, 923 (Ct. App. 2001); Small \r\n  v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 469-70, 494 S.E.2d 835, 846 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).Â  To warrant reversal, the appellant must prove both the error of the \r\n  ruling and resulting prejudice.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, \r\n  391, 574 S.E.2d 215, 219 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when \r\n  there is an error of law or factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  \r\n  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987); Burroughs, \r\n  352 S.C. at 391, 574 S.E.2d at 219; Hedgepath v. Amer. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 340, 353, 559 S.E.2d 327, 334 (Ct. App. 2001); Bayle v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 128, 542 S.E.2d 736, 742 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  A courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an \r\n  abuse of discretion where the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, \r\n  or unfair.Â  Gates, 348 S.C. at 166, 558 S.E.2d at 924.Â  The appellant \r\n  must show prejudice for the Court of Appeals to reverse a judgment.Â  Hanahan \r\n  v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997); Commerce Ctr. \r\n  of Greenville v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 559, \r\n  556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nTo be competent as an expert, a witness must have \r\n  acquired, by reason of study or experience, or both, such knowledge and skill \r\n  in a business, profession, or science that he is better qualified than the fact \r\n  finder to form an opinion.Â  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 \r\n  S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997); Ott v. Pittman, 320 S.C. \r\n  72, 76, 463 S.E.2d 101, 104 (Ct. App. 1995); Hall v. Clarendon Outdoor Adver., \r\n  Inc., 311 S.C. 185, 188, 428 S.E.2d 1, 2 (Ct. App. 1993); Rule 702, SCRE \r\n  (â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier \r\n  of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness \r\n  qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, \r\n  may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€).Â  It is incumbent \r\n  that the party offering the expert manifest that the witness possesses the necessary \r\n  learning, skill, or practical experience to enable him to give opinion testimony.Â  \r\n  State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551 (1990); Thomas Sand Co. \r\n  v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 410-11, 563 S.E.2d 109, 113 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  The test is a relative one, depending on the particular witnessâ€™s \r\n  reference to the subject.Â  Gooding, 326 S.C. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598; \r\n  Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 285, 457 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1995).Â  An expert \r\n  is not limited to any class of persons acting professionally.Â  Gooding, \r\n  326 S.C. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598; Botehlo v. Bycura, 282 S.C. 578, \r\n  320 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  There is no exact requirement concerning how \r\n  knowledge or skill must be acquired. Â Honea v. Prior, 295 S.C. 526, 369 \r\n  S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nUsually, if opinion testimony is offered by a physician \r\n  or surgeon, his competency to testify as an expert is sufficiently established \r\n  by the fact that he has been duly licensed to practice medicine or surgery.Â  \r\n  State v. Moorer, 241 S.C. 487, 129 S.E.2d 330 (1963) (overruled on other \r\n  grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)); Hill \r\n  v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 204 S.C. 83, 28 S.E.2d 545 (1943).Â  A \r\n  physician or surgeon is not incompetent to testify as an expert merely because \r\n  he is not a specialist in the particular branch of his profession involved in \r\n  the case.Â  Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 426 S.E.2d 785 (1993).Â  \r\n  The fact that the physician is not a specialist in the particular area affects \r\n  only the weight of the witnessâ€™s testimony and affords no basis for completely \r\n  rejecting it.Â  Hill, 204 S.C. at 109, 28 S.E.2d at 555; Brown v. LaFrance \r\n  Indus., 286 S.C. 319, 333 S.E.2d 348 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nA proper technique for attacking an expertâ€™s testimony \r\n  is to impeach him on his limited experience in the area about which he has testified.Â  \r\n  Any defects in the amount and quality of education or experience go to the weight \r\n  to be accorded the expertâ€™s testimony, but not its admissibility.Â  State \r\n  v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 505, 435 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1993); State v. \r\n  Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551 (1990); Ott, 320 S.C. at 76, \r\n  463 S.E.2d at 104.Â  An expert is not limited to any class of persons acting \r\n  professionally, for the test for qualifying as an expert is a relative one that \r\n  is dependent on the particular witnessâ€™s reference to the subject.Â  See \r\n  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 317 S.C. 320, 324, 454 S.E.2d 328, \r\n  330 (Ct. App. 1995), revâ€™d in part on other grounds, 326 S.C. 248, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d 596 (1997) (an emergency room technician who was licensed to perform \r\n  intubations and had taught the procedure was qualified to testify about the \r\n  proper way to intubate a patient in a medical malpractice suit against a board-certified \r\n  anesthesiologist); McMillan v. Durant, 312 S.C. 200, 439 S.E.2d 829 (1993) \r\n  (a neurosurgeon who was also a teacher in nursing was qualified to testify about \r\n  the appropriate standard for nursing care).\r\nOne of Fieldsâ€™s experts was Dr. George Podgorny. \r\n  Â Podgornyâ€™s testimony was taken by video deposition and was introduced during \r\n  the trial.Â  The deposition showed that Podgorny specialized in emergency medicine \r\n  and had practiced emergency medicine for twenty-five years.Â  Fieldsâ€™s counsel \r\n  asked Podgorny whether he was board-certified in emergency medicine.Â  Podgorny \r\n  answered that he was not and sought to explain his answer.Â  â€œThe reason \r\n  [why Iâ€™m not board-certified] is that I was the first president of the Board \r\n  of Emergency Medicine and was instrumental in development of the examination, \r\n  and then served for many years as the editor of both the written and the oral \r\n  exam.â€Â  Hane objected to the reason coming before the jury on hearsay \r\n  grounds.Â  The circuit court agreed it was hearsay and excluded it.Â  Fields proffered \r\n  Podgornyâ€™s remaining testimony regarding this issue.Â  â€œ[T]he opinion of \r\n  legal counsel was that there may be a conflict of interest if I [had taken] \r\n  the exam [because it would have been perceived] that I knowed [sic] all the \r\n  answers.â€\r\nFields maintains the circuit court erred \r\n  by excluding Podgornyâ€™s testimony regarding his explanation for not being board-certified \r\n  in emergency medicine and is entitled to a new trial.Â  We agree.\r\nHearsay is â€œa statement, other than one \r\n  made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence \r\n  to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Proof of a \r\n  statement introduced to show a party heard and acted upon information is not \r\n  objectionable hearsay.Â  Webb v. Elrod, 308 S.C. 445, 449, 418 S.E.2d \r\n  559, 562 (Ct. App. 1992); 31A C.J.S. Evidence Â§ 259 (1996) (â€œ[T]estimony \r\n  is not hearsay where it relates to what the witness himself did in reliance \r\n  on, or in response to, a statement, facts upon which action was taken, personal \r\n  observations, explanation of conduct, the effect of statements on the listener, \r\n  the fact that something was said, or identifying what was said.â€).\r\nPodgornyâ€™s statement is a classic example \r\n  of showing an action based upon information and is not offered for the truth \r\n  of the matter asserted.Â  The statement was not offered to prove that the counsel \r\n  was correct in showing that there would be a conflict of interest if Podgorny \r\n  took the test, but rather explained why Podgorny did not take the test and therefore, \r\n  was not board-certified.Â  \r\nThis case presented the quintessential \r\n  battle of the experts.Â  Fieldsâ€™s experts, including Podgorny, contended the \r\n  hospital and Hane failed to reach an appropriate level of care. Fields specifically \r\n  avowed they committed malpractice by failing to take an adequate history and \r\n  failing to admit Fields in light of his history.Â  The hospitalâ€™s and Haneâ€™s \r\n  experts professed that because they were so familiar with Fields and had reviewed \r\n  so many of his prior medical records, they met a reasonable level of care by \r\n  not admitting Fields.Â  In this scenario, the credentials of the experts are \r\n  critical when the jury is determining the credibility of the competing expert \r\n  witnesses.\r\nHane protests that even if the statement \r\n  was not hearsay, its exclusion was harmless error.Â  We disagree.Â  Each expert \r\n  was asked whether he was board-certified in emergency medicine when testifying \r\n  during the trial.Â  Even Hane was asked if he was board-certified during his \r\n  testimony.Â  During the closing arguments, Haneâ€™s counsel asserted that his expert, \r\n  Bartlett, was board-certified in emergency medicine and was a true expert as \r\n  opposed to Podgorny, who was not board-certified.Â  â€œRemember Dr. Bartlett \r\n  . . . This man is a true expert. He knows what heâ€™s talking about.Â  Dr. Podgorny, \r\n  what evidence is there that Dr. Podgorny writes the test?Â  Ridiculous!Â  Dr. \r\n  Podgorny never took the test to be board certified.â€\r\nHaneâ€™s closing argument shows that \r\n  Fields was irrefutably prejudiced by the exclusion of this testimony.Â  Since \r\n  the statement was not hearsay, the jury was entitled to hear Podgornyâ€™s response \r\n  to the question of why he had never taken the test for board certification in \r\n  emergency medicine.Â  This case demonstrated the paradigmatic example of â€œclashing \r\n  experts and debatable qualifications.â€Â  It was reversible error to exclude Podgornyâ€™s \r\n  testimony.\r\nII.Â  Admission of Learned Treatise\r\nDuring Haneâ€™s cross-examination, Fieldsâ€™s \r\n  counsel queried Hane whether he thought a single isolated EKG, as opposed to \r\n  continued monitoring with multiple EKGs, was appropriate.Â  Hane stated he thought \r\n  it was appropriate.Â  Fields then asked Hane if he was familiar with a textbook \r\n  of emergency medicine authored by Tintinalli, Krome and Ruiz.Â  Hane responded \r\n  that he was familiar with the treatise since it was used as a reference text \r\n  in the emergency room.Â  Hane admitted the book was an authority in emergency \r\n  medicine.Â  Fieldsâ€™s counsel noticed the text was sitting on Haneâ€™s table and \r\n  asked whether Hane had reviewed the text prior to his testimony.Â  Fields sought \r\n  to question Hane on the contents contained in the text.\r\nHaneâ€™s counsel objected to the question \r\n  referring to the text on the basis of an improper foundation and the text was \r\n  not referred to in the answer to interrogatories, which asked what treatises \r\n  or materials Fields would use during the trial.Â  The circuit court sustained \r\n  Haneâ€™s objection on the grounds that Fields failed to list the treatise in the \r\n  answer to interrogatories.Â  \r\nFields asserts the circuit court committed \r\n  reversible error when it sustained Haneâ€™s objection and prohibited Fields from \r\n  questioning Hane about the text of the treatise.Â  We agree.\r\nParties are allowed to cross-examine an \r\n  expert witness about a treatise used or relied upon by the expert witness to \r\n  support his opinion in direct examination.Â  31A Am. Jur. 2d Expert and Opinion \r\n  Evidence Â§ 104 (2002).\r\n\r\nTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness \r\n  upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert in direct examination, statements \r\n  contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of \r\n  history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority \r\n  by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other testimony or by judicial \r\n  notice [are not excluded by the hearsay rule.]\r\n\r\nRule 803(18), SCRE.\r\nThere is no question in this case that \r\n  the Tintinalli book is a recognized treatise.Â  Hane acknowledged the book is \r\n  a commonly used reference in the emergency room and he admitted reviewing the \r\n  text prior to his testimony.Â  There was certainly a sufficient foundation established \r\n  for its use.\r\nHaneâ€™s interrogatories propounded to Fields \r\n  asked: â€œGive the title, author, date, volume and page, where appropriate, of \r\n  any periodical, journal, text, paper or other publication of any kind, to which \r\n  [Fields] intends to refer, or about which [Fields] intends to ask any questions, \r\n  during the examination o[r] cross-examination of any witness at trial or during \r\n  any deposition.â€Â  Fields responded, â€œPlaintiff has not yet identified any specific \r\n  journals, text of learned treaties. [sic]Â  The Plaintiff reserves the right \r\n  to supplement this interrogatory at a later date once an expert witness has \r\n  been identified or once discovery from the other parties has been completed.â€Â  \r\n  Fields did not supplement her answers and stated she was not aware of the Tintinalli \r\n  treatise until the morning of the trial.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 37(b)(2), SCRCP allows a court to \r\n  impose a variety of sanctions for failure to comply with a discovery order. \r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he court in which the action is pending may make \r\n  such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:\r\n  \r\n(A) An order that the matters regarding \r\n  which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be \r\n  established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the \r\n  party obtaining the order;\r\n(B) An order refusing to allow \r\n  the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or \r\n  prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in evidence;\r\n(C) An order striking out pleadings \r\n  or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, \r\n  or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment \r\n  by default against the disobedient party;\r\n(D) In lieu of any of the foregoing \r\n  orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a contempt of court the \r\n  failure to obey any orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental \r\n  examination;\r\n(E) Where a party has failed to \r\n  comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring him to produce another for examination, \r\n  such orders as are listed in paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this subdivision, \r\n  unless the party failing to comply show that he is unable to produce such person \r\n  for examination.\r\n  \r\nIn lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition \r\n  thereto, the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the \r\n  attorney advising him or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's \r\n  fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially \r\n  justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\r\n\r\nRule 37(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  The circuit court sanctioned \r\n  Fields by disallowing the use of the Tintinalli treatise during Haneâ€™s cross-examination.\r\nThe decision of what kind and whether \r\n  to impose discovery sanctions is left to the sound discretion of the circuit \r\n  court.Â  Griffin Grading &amp; Clearing v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., \r\n  334 S.C. 193, 198, 511 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct. App. 1999); Downey v. Dixon, \r\n  294 S.C. 42, 45, 362 S.E.2d 317, 318 (Ct. App. 1987); McGaha v. Mosley, \r\n  283 S.C. 268, 277, 322 S.E.2d 416, 466 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In deciding what sanction \r\n  to impose, the circuit court should weigh the nature of the interrogatories, \r\n  the discovery posture of the case, willfulness, and the degree of prejudice.Â  \r\n  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 112, 495 S.E.2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997); Moran v. Jones, 281 S.C. 270, 276, 315 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984).Â  A circuit courtâ€™s failure to exercise discretion is itself an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  In re Robert M., 294 S.C. 69, 71, 362 S.E.2d 639, 640 \r\n  (1987); State v.

Dunlap, 266 S.C. 230, 239, 222 S.E.2d 8, 12Â  (1976); Laney v. Hefley, \r\n  262 S.C. 54, 202 S.E.2d 12 (1974). The purpose of interrogatories is to promote \r\n  full and fair disclosure to prevent surprise to either party.Â  South Carolina \r\n  State Hightway Depâ€™t v. Booker, 260 S.C. 245, 252, 195 S.E.2d 615, 619 (1973); \r\n  see also Reed v. Clark, 277 S.C. 310, 316, 286 S.E.2d 384, 388 \r\n  (1982) (â€œDisclosure of information between the parties before trial is designed \r\n  to avoid surprise and to promote decisions on the merits after a full and fair \r\n  hearing.â€).\r\nIn this case, Fields stated she only found \r\n  out about the treatise on the day of the trial.Â  Concomitantly, there was no \r\n  showing of willfulness.Â  Hane had a copy of the treatise with him during the \r\n  trial and admitted using it to prepare for his testimony.Â  Therefore, Hane could \r\n  certainly not be surprised by being asked about this treatise as it was the \r\n  very same one he was using himself.Â  This negates any contention that Hane was \r\n  prejudiced by Fieldsâ€™s failure to supplement her interrogatories.Â  The only \r\n  factor the judge discussed when excluding questions involving the treatise was \r\n  the nature of the interrogatory:Â  â€œThatâ€™s the reason we have interrogatories \r\n  so we wonâ€™t have surprises in trials, right?â€\r\nIn Samples v. Mitchell, the court instructed: \r\n  â€œIn deciding what sanction to impose for failure to disclose evidence during \r\n  the discovery process, the trial court should weigh the nature of the interrogatories, \r\n  the discovery posture of the case, willfulness, and the degree of prejudice.â€Â  \r\n  329 S.C. at 112, 495 S.E.2d at 216 (citing Laney, 262 S.C. at 60, 202 \r\n  S.E.2d at 15 (1974); Moran, 218 S.C. at 276, 315 S.E.2d at 139-40).Â  \r\n  The circuit court failed to exercise discretion.Â  â€œA failure to exercise discretion \r\n  amounts to an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  Samples, 329 S.C. at 112, 495 \r\n  S.E.2d at 216 (citing Fontaine, 291 S.C. at 538, 354 S.E.2d at 566 (â€œWhen \r\n  the trial judge is vested with discretion, but his ruling reveals no discretion \r\n  was, in fact, exercised, an error of law has occurred.â€); Balloon Plantation, \r\n  303 S.C. at 155, 399 S.E.2d at 441 (quoting Smith, 276 S.C. at 498, 280 \r\n  S.E.2d at 202 (â€œIt is an equal abuse of discretion to refuse to exercise discretionary \r\n  authority when it is warranted as it is to exercise the discretion improperly.â€))).Â  \r\n  We find the circuit court erred when it disallowed Fields from using the Tintinalli \r\n  treatise in cross-examining Hane.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n HUFF, J., and MOREHEAD, Acting Judge, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3624","title":"Moody v.

Gagne, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nRobert W. Buffington, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â  Sharon D. \r\n  Moody brought a declaratory judgment action against her automobile insurance \r\n  carrier, Dairyland Insurance Company (â€œDairylandâ€), claiming her insurance policy \r\n  should be reformed to include underinsured motorist (â€œUIMâ€) coverage up to the \r\n  policyâ€™s statutory minimum liability limits (â€œstatutory minimum limitsâ€) because \r\n  Dairyland failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage.Â  The circuit court \r\n  granted Dairylandâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Moody appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn June 14, 2000, Moody purchased an automobile \r\n  insurance policy with the statutory minimum limits from Dairyland. \r\n  [1] Â  Dairyland offered Moody UIM coverage only in an amount equal to the \r\n  statutory minimum limits of her policy.Â  Moody expressly rejected Dairylandâ€™s \r\n  offer of UIM coverage.\r\nSubsequently, Moody was involved in an automobile \r\n  accident in which she alleged the other driver was at fault.Â  She claimed she \r\n  was entitled to proceeds from her policyâ€™s UIM coverage because her damages \r\n  exceeded the limits of the at-fault driverâ€™s liability insurance policy.Â  Dairyland \r\n  denied the claim, stating Moodyâ€™s policy contained no UIM coverage.\r\nMoody filed this declaratory judgment action, seeking \r\n  to have her insurance policy reformed to include UIM coverage.Â  She argued Dairyland \r\n  failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage in amounts less than the statutory \r\n  minimum limits.Â  Dairyland moved for summary judgment.Â  Dairyland argued, pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code Annotated section 38-73-470 (Supp. 2002), it was not \r\n  required to offer UIM coverage in amounts less than the statutory minimum limits.Â  \r\n  The circuit court agreed and granted Dairylandâ€™s motion.Â  Moody appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is granted â€œwhen there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.â€Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 \r\n  (2001).Â  When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, this Court must use â€œthe \r\n  same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.â€Â  Lanham \r\n  v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, \r\n  563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  Moreover, â€œ[o]n appeal from an order granting summary \r\n  judgment, [this Court] will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences \r\n  arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.â€Â  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, \r\n  563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMoody argues the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  Dairylandâ€™s motion for summary judgment, asserting Dairyland did not make a \r\n  meaningful offer of UIM coverage because it failed to offer coverage in amounts \r\n  less than the statutory minimum limits. [2] Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno \r\n  Yacht Sales, Inc., Op. No. 25592 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 3, 2003) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 5 at 11, 19).Â  Moreover, â€œ[w]here the terms of the statute are \r\n  clear, [this Court] must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€Â  \r\n  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. \r\n  507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002); see also Rowe v. Hyatt, \r\n  321 S.C. 366, 369, 468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996) (holding when â€œinterpreting a \r\n  statute, words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting \r\n  to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operationâ€).\r\nIn relevant part, section 38-73-470 provides â€œ[t]here \r\n  is no requirement for an insurer or an agent to offer underinsured motorist \r\n  coverage at limits less than the statutorily required bodily injury or property \r\n  damage limits.â€ [3] Â  Dairyland asserts this amendment \r\n  specifically alleviated the requirement that insurers offer UIM coverage in \r\n  any amount below the statutory minimum limits.\r\nHowever, Moody argues the language of section 38-73-470 \r\n  â€œbasically states a contract principle which states that no one had to make \r\n  any offer [at all].â€Â  Furthermore, Moody asserts South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 38-77-160 (Supp. 2002) (requiring automobile insurance carriers to offer \r\n  UIM coverage â€œup to the limits of the insured liability coverageâ€) and the cases \r\n  interpreting this section, required Dairyland to offer UIM coverage at amounts \r\n  less than the statutory minimum limits.Â  In each of the following cases, Butler \r\n  v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 407, 475 S.E.2d 758, 761 (1996), Norwood \r\n  v. Allstate Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 503, 489 S.E.2d 661 (Ct. App. 1997), and \r\n  Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 488, 462 S.E.2d 291, 296 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995), the central holding was section 38-77-160 mandates an insurer \r\n  to offer UIM coverage in amounts less than the statutory minimum limits.\r\nBoth of Moodyâ€™s arguments fail.Â  First, we decline \r\n  to accept Moodyâ€™s particularly parsed and strained reading of section 38-73-470.Â  \r\n  The relevant statutory language in this section is unambiguous and conveys a \r\n  clear and definite meaning that insurance carriers are under no duty to offer \r\n  UIM coverage at any amount less than the statutory minimum limits.\r\nMoreover, Moodyâ€™s reliance on section 38-77-160 \r\n  and the cases interpreting it is misplaced.Â  Butler, Norwood, \r\n  and Osborne were decided prior to the effective date of the 1997 amendment \r\n  to section 38-73-470.Â  Thus, these cases were correctly decided under the then-existing \r\n  law.Â  However, these cases are no longer controlling because each was decided \r\n  prior to the 1997 amendment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order granting Dairylandâ€™s motion for summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  all of Columbia; Solicitor John R. Justice, of Chester; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n GOOLSBY, J.:Â  Douglas Edward McCloud \r\n  appeals his conviction for criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature (CDVHAN), arguing the indictment did not enumerate the elements of the \r\n  offense and was therefore insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  on the trial court.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe indictment was captioned â€œINDICTMENT \r\n  FOR CRIMINAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE â€“ AGGRAVATED.â€Â  The body of the indictment \r\n  read as follows:Â  â€œThat Douglas Edward McCloud did in Fairfield County on or \r\n  about June 16, 2000 commit an act of violence against Kermisha L. Golden, by \r\n  striking her in [the] face with his closed fist, also hit her in [the] head \r\n  and pulled her hair an[d] scratched her neck.â€Â  The indictment concluded \r\n  with the standard phrase â€œ[a]gainst the peace and dignity of the State and, \r\n  contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.â€Â  \r\nWhen the case was called for trial on October 26, \r\n  2000, McCloud failed to appear and was tried in his absence.Â  The jury \r\n  found him guilty, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.Â  \r\n  On April 19, 2001, McCloud was brought before the trial court, at \r\n  which time the clerk read the sentence imposed on him.\r\n1.Â  McCloud first argues that the indictment was \r\n  deficient because it failed to allege that the victim was a â€œhousehold member.â€Â Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 16-25-20 provides \r\n  that â€œ[i]t is unlawful to: (1) cause physical harm or injury to a personâ€™s own \r\n  household member, (2) offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a \r\n  personâ€™s own household member with apparent present ability under circumstances \r\n  reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.â€ \r\n  [1] Â  Section 16-25-10 defines â€œhousehold memberâ€ as â€œspouses, former spouses, \r\n  parents and children, persons related by consanguinity or affinity within the \r\n  second degree, persons who have a child in common, and a male and female who \r\n  are cohabiting or formerly have cohabited.â€ \r\n  [2] Â  Section 16-25-65(A) provides that â€œ[t]he elements of the common law \r\n  crime of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature are incorporated \r\n  in and made a part of the offense of criminal domestic violence of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature when a person violates the provisions of Section 16-25-20 \r\n  and the elements of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature are \r\n  present.â€ [3]   \r\nAt trial, Golden testified that McCloud \r\n  had been her boyfriend for six years and they had a three-year-old child together.Â  \r\n  Admittedly, however, the indictment does not allege that Golden was McCloudâ€™s \r\n  â€œhousehold memberâ€ or otherwise set forth the criteria that would accord her \r\n  this status.Â  Nevertheless, we believe this deficiency did not deprive \r\n  the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the case.\r\nâ€œAn indictment is adequate if the offense \r\n  is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to \r\n  know what judgment to pronounce, the defendant to know what he is called upon \r\n  to answer, and acquittal or conviction to be placed in bar to any subsequent \r\n  conviction.â€ [4] Â  Moreover, these \r\n  indictment sufficiency criteria â€œmust be viewed with a practical eye; all \r\n  the surrounding circumstances must be weighed before an accurate determination \r\n  of whether a defendant was or was not prejudiced can be reached.â€ [5] Â  â€œ[O]ne is to look at the â€˜surrounding \r\n  circumstancesâ€™ that existed pre-trial, in order to determine whether a given \r\n  defendant has been â€˜prejudiced,â€™ i.e., taken by surprise and hence unable to \r\n  combat the charges against him.â€ [6] \r\nHere, the pretrial surrounding circumstances \r\n  of this case do not warrant dismissing the indictment.Â  Although the indictment \r\n  failed to allege that Golden was McCloudâ€™s household member or specify how she \r\n  would qualify as such, there was no dispute either at trial or on appeal that \r\n  she was the alleged victim in this case and had â€œa child in commonâ€ with McCloud. \r\n  [7] Â  In addition, McCloud had received a preliminary hearing, a \r\n  circumstance that would support the conclusion that, under the â€œpractical eyeâ€ \r\n  test, he â€œobviously knew the crimes for which he was being triedâ€ [8]  and was therefore not unduly prejudiced by the alleged defect \r\n  in the indictment.Â  Moreover, the indictment contained the standard language \r\n  that the offense alleged was â€œ[a]gainst the peace and dignity of the State, \r\n  and contrary to the statute in such case made and providedâ€; therefore, we hold \r\n  it satisfied the statutory requirements to be deemed sufficient to give the \r\n  trial court subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. \r\n  [9] Â  Finally, the caption of the indictment named the offense that McCloud \r\n  was alleged to have committed, and although it was not a part of the indictment, \r\n  it was â€œconsistent with the charging language.â€ \r\n  [10]   \r\n2.Â  We further reject McCloudâ€™s argument that the \r\n  indictment failed to specify circumstances of aggravation necessary to establish \r\n  CDVHAN. Among other things, the indictment alleged that McCloud struck the victim \r\n  in the face with his closed fist, hit her in the head, pulled her hair, and \r\n  scratched her neck.Â  Furthermore, the arrest warrant contained an affidavit \r\n  stating the victim suffered swelling and bruising to her right eye and had to \r\n  seek medical attention at the hospital.Â  Finally, it is apparent from the indictment \r\n  that there was a difference in gender between McCloud and Golden, as evidenced \r\n  by the allegation that McCloud committed an act of violence against Golden â€œby \r\n  striking her in [the] face with his closed fistâ€ [emphasis added].Â  \r\n  These averments in the indictment, when considered with the surrounding \r\n  circumstances that had surfaced before the commencement of the trial, were sufficient \r\n  to notify McCloud that he was charged with causing serious bodily injury to \r\n  the victim. [11] \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.Â  SHULER, J., \r\n  dissents in a separate opinion. \r\n SHULER, J., dissenting:Â  Because \r\n  I believe the language of McCloudâ€™s indictment did not sufficiently state the \r\n  offense of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN), \r\n  I respectfully dissent.\r\nThe majority concludes McCloudâ€™s indictment \r\n  is sufficient because they find, in evaluating the circumstances surrounding \r\n  the indictment, he was apprised of the charge against him.Â  However, as I interpret \r\n  South Carolina precedent regarding indictments and subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  the body of the indictment must sufficiently identify the elements of the charged \r\n  offense.Â  See, e.g., Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 56, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  324, 325 (2000) (holding â€œ[a] circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  if . . . there has been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense. \r\n  . . .â€) (emphasis added); Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 4, 507 S.E.2d \r\n  322, 323 (1998) (finding the true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is \r\n  whether it contains the elements of the offense and sufficiently apprises \r\n  the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet) (emphasis added).Â  As such, \r\n  McCloudâ€™s indictment for CDVHAN is clearly insufficient, as it neither identifies \r\n  the victim as a household member nor specifically alleges an aggravating circumstance.\r\nThe elements of CDVHAN are satisfied \r\n  when an individual causes physical harm to a household member and the elements \r\n  of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) are present.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-25-20, 16-25-65 (2003).Â  â€œA â€˜household memberâ€™ means spouses, \r\n  former spouses, parents and children, persons related by consanguinity or affinity \r\n  within the second degree, persons who have a child in common, and a male and \r\n  female who are cohabiting or formerly have cohabited.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-10 \r\n  (2003).Â  As the majority acknowledges in its opinion, McCloudâ€™s indictment clearly \r\n  fails to allege the victimâ€™s status as a â€œhousehold member,â€ an element necessary \r\n  to sustain an indictment for CDVHAN.Â  While McCloud and the victim have a child \r\n  together, this fact is not stated in the indictment.Â  Thus, the key element \r\n  necessary for a proper CDVHAN indictment is missing. \r\nThere is no mention of the statute or code section \r\n  in either the body of the indictment or the caption.Â  Thus, the elements cannot \r\n  be implied in that manner.Â  See, e.g., State v. Owens, 346 S.C. \r\n  637, 649, 552 S.E.2d 745, 751 (2001) (holding the failure to include an element \r\n  of a statutory offense in the body of an indictment will not invalidate the \r\n  indictment if specific reference to the statute is made in the body of the indictment).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, one cannot infer the elements of an offense from the caption of \r\n  the indictment.Â  See State v. Lark, 64 S.C. 350, 353, 42 S.E. \r\n  175, 176-77 (1902) (finding the caption of the indictment cannot be used to \r\n  expand or contract the allegations, because it is not a part of the findings \r\n  by the grand jury); cf. State v. Tabory, 262 S.C. 136, 141, 202 \r\n  S.E.2d 852, 854 (1974) (holding the State may not support a conviction for an \r\n  offense intended to be charged by relying upon a caption to the exclusion of \r\n  the language contained in the body of the indictment).Â  As such, the fact that \r\n  McCloudâ€™s indictment was captioned as â€œcriminal domestic violence â€“ aggravatedâ€ \r\n  is not enough to render the indictment sufficient.Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore, all that should be \r\n  examined in this particular situation is the actual body of the indictment itself.Â  \r\n  See Tate v. State, 345 S.C. 577, 581, 549 S.E.2d 601, 603 (2001) \r\n  (finding it is the body of the indictment that is controlling).Â  In the instant \r\n  case, the body of the indictment alone does not sufficiently describe the elements \r\n  needed for a CDVHAN offense.Â  In fact, the description of the offense in the \r\n  body of McCloudâ€™s indictment is sufficiently vague that it could satisfy the \r\n  elements of either ABHAN [12]  \r\n  or simple assault and battery. [13] Â  Without mention of the crucial element of \r\n  CDVHAN â€“ the victimâ€™s status as a household member â€“ it is impossible to determine \r\n  from the body of the indictment the crime with which McCloud was charged.Â  As \r\n  such, I believe McCloudâ€™s indictment for CDVHAN was deficient.Â  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003) (an indictment is sufficient if it â€œcharges the \r\n  crime substantially in the language . . . of the statute prohibiting the crime \r\n  or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood.â€); \r\n  see also State v. Bullard, 348 S.C. 611, 614, 560 S.E.2d 436, \r\n  437 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nFurthermore, common sense dictates \r\n  that adopting the majorityâ€™s reasoning undermines the purpose of the grand jury \r\n  system.Â  The 18 members of the grand jury are convened as an impartial panel \r\n  for the purpose of reviewing the Stateâ€™s evidence against a criminal defendant.Â  \r\n  The grand jury must pass on the elements alleged in the indictment before the \r\n  indictment can be true-billed.Â  If the majorityâ€™s analysis is adopted, the actual \r\n  body of the indictment will become inconsequential because â€“ long after the \r\n  grand jury has deliberated â€“ a court will be able to supplement the language \r\n  of the indictment by examination of pre-trial circumstances.Â  In my view, this \r\n  type of analysis after the fact serves to weaken the role and function of the \r\n  grand jury system.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would vacate McCloudâ€™s \r\n  conviction for CDVHAN.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  S.C.

Nelsonâ€™s guardian \r\n  ad litem brought suit against Thomas W. Phillips, M.D., Drs. Coker, Phillips, \r\n  and Haswell, P.A., QHG of South Carolina, Inc., d/b/a Carolina Hospital System, \r\n  and Quorum Health Group, Inc. seeking recovery for damages caused by alleged \r\n  medical malpractice during Nelsonâ€™s delivery.Â  The circuit court granted the \r\n  motion to dismiss on behalf of Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. and Thomas \r\n  W. Phillips, M.D.Â  Nelson appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTyâ€™Quain S. Nelson was born on March 5, \r\n  1993.Â  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. was the attending obstetrician during Nelsonâ€™s \r\n  delivery.Â  During delivery, a complication occurred where Nelsonâ€™s shoulder \r\n  became lodged behind the motherâ€™s pubic bone. Â This is known as shoulder dystocia.Â  \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s upper and lower portions of his right-side brachial plexus nerves were \r\n  injured during the delivery.Â  The damage to the upper portion, called â€œErbâ€™s \r\n  palsy,â€ involves primarily the shoulder, elbow, and their related muscles.Â  \r\n  The damage to the lower portion, known as â€œKlumpkeâ€™s palsy,â€ causes paralysis \r\n  to the hand and results in fingers which are grossly deformed, misshapen, twisted, \r\n  and contorted.\r\nOn February 26, 2001, Nelson sued Thomas \r\n  W. Phillips, M.D., his medical group, Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A., \r\n  QHG of South Carolina, Inc., d/b/a Carolina Hospital System, and Quorum Health \r\n  Group, Inc., alleging that Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. was negligent in managing \r\n  and resolving the shoulder dystocia and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. \r\n  was liable under vicarious liability.Â  This suit was brought by Nelsonâ€™s maternal \r\n  grandfather and current guardian ad litem, James Nelson, Jr.Â  Shortly after \r\n  filing the summons and complaint, Nelsonâ€™s current counsel discovered that Nelsonâ€™s \r\n  mother, Latonia Nelson, who had previously been Nelsonâ€™s guardian ad litem, \r\n  had filed an earlier suit involving the same injuries.\r\nThe first lawsuit, filed in 1996, was \r\n  styled â€œTyqun [sic] Nelson, a minor under the age of fourteen (14) years, by \r\n  his duly appointed Guardian Ad Litem Latonia Nelson, vs. Carolina Womenâ€™s Center \r\n  [sic] and Thomas W. Phillips, M.D.â€Â  During the litigation of the 1996 suit, \r\n  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. made a motion to compel Nelson to answer interrogatories \r\n  and requests for production.Â  The circuit court issued an order compelling \r\n  the discovery responses within fifteen days.Â  Nelson failed to comply, and Thomas \r\n  W. Phillips, M.D. filed a motion to dismiss based upon Nelsonâ€™s failure to respond.Â  \r\n  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. also moved for summary judgment on the grounds that \r\n  Nelson had failed to offer any evidence of a breach of the reasonable standard \r\n  of care through an expert witness.\r\nThe circuit court held the motion to dismiss \r\n  in abeyance and gave Nelson forty-five additional days â€œin which to identify \r\n  an expert witness and to provide a summary of the witnesses [sic] anticipated \r\n  trial testimony.â€Â  Nelsonâ€™s attorney failed to comply, and the circuit court \r\n  granted Thomas W. Phillips, M.D.â€™s summary judgment motion because there was \r\n  no expert testimony establishing Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. had breached the standard \r\n  of care.Â  The order dismissed Nelsonâ€™s 1996 complaint with prejudice.Â  However, \r\n  the circuit court granted Nelson an additional thirty days to file a motion \r\n  to reconsider with an expert affidavit to establish a prima facie case.Â  Nelson \r\n  did not file a motion to reconsider.\r\nNelsonâ€™s attorney in the current case \r\n  filed a notice of dismissal voluntarily dismissing Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. \r\n  pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A), SCRCP.Â  Nelsonâ€™s notice of dismissal expressed \r\n  his intent to proceed against all the other named defendants.Â  After dismissal \r\n  of the lawsuit against Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A), \r\n  a motion to dismiss was filed on behalf of Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, \r\n  P.A. and Thomas W. Phillips, M.D.Â  The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss \r\n  with prejudice for both Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and \r\n  Haswell, P.A.Â  The circuit court ruled: (1) res judicata barred this action \r\n  because the 1996 order granting Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. summary judgment was \r\n  an adjudication of Nelsonâ€™s case on the merits; (2) Nelson was collaterally \r\n  estopped from asserting the same argument in this case because the summary judgment \r\n  motion was an adjudication on the merits; and (3) under the theory of respondeat \r\n  superior, a master is not liable if the servant is not liable.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may make \r\n  a motion to dismiss based upon the plaintiffâ€™s failure to state a claim constituting \r\n  a cause of action.Â  Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 352 S.C. 221, \r\n  573 S.E.2d 805 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The trial judge may dismiss the claim if the \r\n  defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed â€œto state facts sufficient to \r\n  constitute a cause of actionâ€ in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Williams \r\n  v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 232-33, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP).Â  When considering the motion to dismiss for failure to \r\n  state a claim, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon the allegations \r\n  made on the face of the complaint.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. \r\n  519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999); Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d \r\n  601 (1995).Â  If the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged on the \r\n  complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant \r\n  of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.Â  Brown v. \r\n  Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 353 S.E.2d 697 (1987); McCormick v. England, \r\n  328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The facts and inferences alleged \r\n  on the complaint are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.Â  Toussaint \r\n  v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987); Cowart v. Poore, 337 S.C. \r\n  359, 523 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1999); Mr. G. v. Mrs. G., 320 S.C. 305, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nDismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n  is appealable.Â  Williams, 347 S.C. at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 500.Â  The court \r\n  of appeals applies the same standard of review that was implemented by the trial \r\n  court.Â  Id.Â  In determining whether the trial court properly granted \r\n  the motion to dismiss, we must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the \r\n  light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.Â  Bergstrom, \r\n  352 S.C. at 233, 573 S.E.2d at 811.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Effect of Voluntary Dismissal\r\nNelson argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it granted the motion to dismiss of Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, \r\n  Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. because Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. had been voluntarily \r\n  dismissed from the case and lacked standing to bring the motion on his behalf.Â  \r\n  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. argue that \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s notice of voluntary dismissal was ineffective because it was conditioned \r\n  upon allowing for continued viability against Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, \r\n  P.A., while only dismissing Thomas W. Phillips, M.D.Â  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. \r\n  and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. also assert the notice of voluntary \r\n  dismissal was ineffective because Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. and \r\n  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. were prejudiced when the notice on the voluntary dismissal \r\n  did not provide the dismissal was without prejudice.Â  We agree with Nelson.\r\nRule 41 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure \r\n  allows a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss a defendant from a lawsuit:\r\n\r\nSubject to the provisions of Rule 23(c), of Rule 66(a), and \r\n  of any statute, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of \r\n  court (A) by filing and serving a notice of dismissal at any time before service \r\n  by the adverse party of an answer or motion for summary judgment . . . .Â  Unless \r\n  otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is \r\n  without prejudice . . . .\r\n\r\nRule 41(a)(1), SCRCP.\r\nUnder Rule 41(a)(1)(A), SCRCP, a plaintiff may \r\n  dismiss an action without leave of court before the defendant files an answer \r\n  or motion for summary judgment.Â  Burry &amp; Son Homebuilders, Inc. v. Ford, \r\n  310 S.C. 529, 426 S.E.2d 313 (1992); In re Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 373, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 651, 652-53 (1996) (â€œ[U]nder the plain language of paragraph (a)(1), \r\n  a plaintiff has an unconditional right to voluntarily dismiss an action anytime \r\n  before an answer or motion for summary judgment has been served.â€).Â  Unless \r\n  otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the voluntary dismissal \r\n  of an action by a plaintiff with the consent of the opposing party is without \r\n  prejudice.Â  Gamble v. State, 298 S.C. 176, 379 S.E.2d 118 (1989).Â  Generally, \r\n  a plaintiff is entitled to a voluntary non-suit without prejudice as a matter \r\n  of right unless the defendant shows legal prejudice or important issues of public \r\n  policy are present.Â  Burry &amp; Son Homebuilders, 310 S.C. at 531, 426 \r\n  S.E.2d at 314; Bowen &amp; Smoot v. Plumlee, 301 S.C. 262, 391 S.E.2d \r\n  558 (1990); Prime Med. Corp. v. First Med. Corp., 291 S.C. 296, 353 S.E.2d \r\n  294 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nIn J.J. Lawter Plumbing v. Wen Chow Intâ€™l Trade \r\n  &amp; Inv., Inc., 286 S.C. 49, 331 S.E.2d 789 (Ct. App. 1988), Wen Chow \r\n  hired a general contractor, Padgett, to convert a health spa into a restaurant.Â  \r\n  Padgett hired Lawter as a subcontractor to work on the project.Â  Lawter sued \r\n  Padgett and Wen Chow for nonpayment of fees.Â  Before Padgett filed a pleading \r\n  or a summary judgment motion, Lawter filed a notice of dismissal voluntarily \r\n  dismissing Padgett from the suit.Â  Wen Chow argued the notice of voluntary dismissal \r\n  as to Padgett was improperly granted because Wen Chow had answered and therefore \r\n  the action could not be dismissed.Â  This court rejected Wen Chowâ€™s argument \r\n  by adopting federal case law interpreting the federal version of Rule 41, which \r\n  is identical to Rule 41, SCRCP.Â  â€œThe word â€˜actionâ€™ in the federal rule has \r\n  been interpreted to mean all of the claims against any one defendant, not necessarily \r\n  all of the claims against all the defendants.Â  Thus, a voluntary dismissal [under \r\n  Rule 41] is effective against a defendant who has not answered, even though \r\n  another defendant has.â€Â  Id. at 52-53, 331 S.E.2d at 791.Â  Citing Wen \r\n  Chow, James Flanagan in South Carolina Civil Procedure 2d ed. states, \r\n  â€œOnly the defendants who answered or moved for summary judgment are unaffected \r\n  by the notice of dismissal.â€Â  James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure \r\n  343 (2d ed. 1996).Â  â€œA plaintiffâ€™s motive for dismissal is generally irrelevant \r\n  where the dismissal is effected by notice in the early stages of the litigation.â€Â  \r\n  8 James Wm. Moore et al., Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â¶ 41.11 41-24 (3d \r\n  ed. 2002).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The arguments of Drs. Coker, Phillips, \r\n  and Haswell, P.A. and Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. are unavailing.Â  According to \r\n  Wen Chow, a plaintiff may dismiss only one party to a suit because â€œactionâ€ \r\n  only applies to the plaintiffâ€™s claims against one defendant and not all the \r\n  defendants in a lawsuit.Â  A plaintiff may make a voluntary dismissal by complying \r\n  with the mandate of Rule 41(a)(1)(A), SCRCP, provided the defendant has not \r\n  yet filed a pleading or summary judgment motion.Â  Nelsonâ€™s notice of dismissal \r\n  was not improperly conditioned and was effective.Â  The circuit court erred when \r\n  it dismissed Nelsonâ€™s lawsuit against Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. \r\n  and Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. because Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. was no longer \r\n  a party to the lawsuit and his motion was ineffective.\r\nII.Â  Standing of Thomas W. Phillips, \r\n  M.D.\r\nâ€œA Court of law can know no other persons as parties, \r\n  than those whose rights are made to appear by the record . . . .â€Â  Mâ€™Elwee \r\n  v. House, 17 S.C.L. (1 Bail.) 108, 109 (1828).Â  A person without interest \r\n  in the subject matter of the lawsuit has no legal standing to be heard.Â  Duke \r\n  Power Co. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 284 S.C. 81, 326 S.E.2d 395 (1985); \r\n  Furman Univ. v. Livingston, 244 S.C. 200, 136 S.E.2d 254 (1964).Â  \r\nThis court has concluded that Thomas W. \r\n  Phillips, M.D. does not have standing because Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. \r\n  was voluntarily dismissed under Rule 41(a)(1)(A), SCRCP.Â  Assuming arguendo \r\n  that Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. has standing, we address other issues seriatim.Â  \r\n  Indubitably, Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. has standing to address \r\n  all issues.\r\nÂ  \r\nIII.Â  Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel\r\nâ€œThe doctrine of res adjudicata (or res \r\n  judicata) in the strict sense of that time-honored Latin phrase had its origin \r\n  in the principle that it is in the public interest that there should be an end \r\n  of litigation and that no one should be twice sued for the same cause of action.â€Â  \r\n  First Natâ€™l Bank v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, \r\n  24, 35 S.E.2d 47, 56 (1945).Â  Under this doctrine, a final judgment on the merits \r\n  in a prior action will conclude the parties and their privies in a second action \r\n  based on the same claim as to the issues actually litigated and as to issues \r\n  that might have been litigated in the first action.Â  Sub-Zero Freezer Co. \r\n  v. R.J. Clarkson Co., 308 S.C. 188, 417 S.E.2d 569 (1992); Treadaway \r\n  v. Smith, 325 S.C. 367, 479 S.E.2d 849 (Ct. App. 1996); Foran v. USAA \r\n  Cas. Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 189, 427 S.E.2d 918 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nRes judicata bars subsequent actions by the same \r\n  parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that \r\n  was the subject of a prior action between these parties.Â  Plum Creek Dev. \r\n  Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 512 S.E.2d 106 (1999); Rogers v. \r\n  Kunja Knitting Mills, U.S.A., 336 S.C. 533, 520 S.E.2d 815 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  Res judicata prevents a litigant â€œfrom raising any issues which were adjudicated \r\n  in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former \r\n  suit.â€Â  Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of \r\n  South Carolina, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987); accord \r\n  Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 512 S.E.2d 106 (1999).Â  \r\n  â€œRes judicata is the branch of the law that defines the effect a valid judgment \r\n  may have on subsequent litigation between the same parties and their privies.Â  \r\n  Res judicata ends litigation, promotes judicial economy and avoids the harassment \r\n  of relitigation of the same issues.â€Â  James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil \r\n  Procedure 642 (2d ed. 1996).\r\nTo establish res judicata, the defendant must prove \r\n  three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; \r\n  and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.Â  Sealy v. Dodge, \r\n  289 S.C. 543, 347 S.E.2d 504 (1986); Rogers, 336 S.C. at 537, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  at 817; Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 313 S.C. 181, 437 S.E.2d 130 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Even when the defendant meets all of the required elements, \r\n  res judicata will not be applied â€œwhere it will contravene other important public \r\n  policies; the courts must weigh the competing public policies.â€Â  Johns v. \r\n  Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 203, 420 S.E.2d 856, 859 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nCollateral estoppel differs from res judicata.Â  \r\n  This distinction is explained in Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 315 S.E.2d \r\n  186 (Ct. App. 1984):\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of res judicata and collateral \r\n  estoppel are . . . two different concepts.Â  A final judgment on the merits in \r\n  a prior action will conclude the parties and their privies under the doctrine \r\n  of res judicata in a second action based on the same claim as to issues \r\n  actually litigated and as to issues which might have been litigated in the first \r\n  action.Â  Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, . . . the second action \r\n  is based upon a different claim and the judgment in the first action precludes \r\n  relitigation of only those issues â€œactually and necessarily litigated and determined \r\n  in the first suit.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 369 n.1, 315 S.E.2d at 190 n.1.\r\nâ€œUnder the doctrine of collateral estoppel, \r\n  once a final judgment on the merits has been reached in a prior claim, the relitigation \r\n  of those issues actually and necessarily litigated and determined in the first \r\n  suit are precluded as to the parties and their privies in any subsequent action \r\n  based upon a different claim.â€Â  Richburg v. Baughman, 290 S.C. 431, 434, \r\n  351 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1986); see also State v. Bacote, 331 S.C. \r\n  328, 330, 503 S.E.2d 161, 162 (1998) (â€œâ€˜When an issue of fact or law is actually \r\n  litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination \r\n  is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent \r\n  action between the parties, whether on the same or different claim.â€™â€); McNaughton-McKay \r\n  Elec. Co. of N.C. v. Andrich, 324 S.C. 275, 482 S.E.2d 564 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (noting that collateral estoppel will bar relitigation of an issue that was \r\n  actually litigated and necessary to the outcome of the prior lawsuit).Â  A party \r\n  may assert nonmutual collateral estoppel to thwart relitigation of a previously \r\n  litigated issue unless the party sought to be precluded did not have a full \r\n  and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding, or unless \r\n  other circumstances justify providing the party an opportunity to relitigate \r\n  the issue.Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, 498 S.E.2d 684 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).\r\nThe factors to consider in determining whether \r\n  the defense of collateral estoppel exists and whether the issues were actually \r\n  litigated in the first suit include: whether privity exists, whether the doctrine \r\n  is used offensively or defensively, and whether the party adversely affected \r\n  had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the relevant issue effectively in \r\n  the prior action.Â  Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).Â  The party asserting collateral estoppel must prove that the issue was \r\n  actually litigated and directly determined in the prior action and that the \r\n  matter or fact directly in issue was necessary to support the first judgment.Â  \r\n  Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 552 S.E.2d 767 (Ct. App. 2001); Beall \r\n  v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 315 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Only a party to a \r\n  prior action or one in privity with the party can be precluded from relitigating \r\n  an issue on the basis of offensive collateral estoppel.Â  Carrigg, 347 \r\n  S.C. at 80, 552 S.E.2d at 770.\r\nThere are numerous exceptions to the application \r\n  of res judicata and collateral estoppel.Â  In Pye, this court adopted \r\n  the Restatement (Second) of Judgments section 28, which states:\r\n\r\nAlthough an issue is actually litigated and determined by \r\n  a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, \r\n  relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the parties is not \r\n  precluded in the following circumstances:\r\n(1) The party against whom preclusion is sought could not, \r\n  as a matter of law, have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action; \r\n  or\r\n(2) The issue is one of law and (a) the two actions involve \r\n  claims that are substantially unrelated, or (b) a new determination is warranted \r\n  in order to take account of an intervening change in the applicable legal context \r\n  or otherwise to avoid inequitable administration of the laws; or\r\n(3) A new determination of the issue is warranted by differences \r\n  in the quality or extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts \r\n  or by factors relating to the allocation of jurisdiction between them; or\r\n(4) The party against whom preclusion is sought had a significantly \r\n  heavier burden of persuasion with respect to the issue in the initial action \r\n  than in the subsequent action; the burden has shifted to his adversary; or the \r\n  adversary has a significantly heavier burden than he had in the first action; \r\n  or\r\n(5) There is a clear and convincing need for a new determination \r\n  of the issue (a) because of the potential adverse impact of the determination \r\n  on the public interest or the interests of persons not themselves parties in \r\n  the initial action, (b) because it was not sufficiently foreseeable at the time \r\n  of the initial action that the issue would arise in the context of a subsequent \r\n  action, or (c) because the party sought to be precluded, as a result of the \r\n  conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances, did not have an adequate \r\n  opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial \r\n  action.\r\n\r\nPye, 325 S.C. at 437-38, 480 S.E.2d at 460-61.\r\nIn Beall v. Doe, this court adopted \r\n  section 29 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments:\r\n\r\nA party precluded from relitigating an issue with an opposing \r\n  party, in accordance with Â§Â§ 27 and 28, is also precluded from doing so with \r\n  another person unless the fact that he lacked full and fair opportunity to litigate \r\n  the issue in the first action or other circumstances justify affording him an \r\n  opportunity to relitigate the issue.Â  The circumstances to which considerations \r\n  should be given include those enumerated in Â§ 28 and also whether:\r\n(1) Treating the issues as conclusively determined would be \r\n  incompatible with an applicable scheme of administering the remedies in the \r\n  actions involved;\r\n(2) The forum in the second action affords the party against \r\n  whom preclusion is asserted procedural opportunities in the presentation and \r\n  determination of the issue that were not available in the first action and could \r\n  likely result in the issue being differently determined;\r\n(3) The person seeking to invoke favorable preclusion, or \r\n  to avoid unfavorable preclusion, could have effected joinder in the first action \r\n  between himself and his present adversary;\r\n(4) The determination relied on as preclusive was itself inconsistent \r\n  with another determination of the same issue;\r\n(5) The prior determination may have been affected by relationships \r\n  among the parties to the first action that are not present in the subsequent \r\n  action, or apparently was based on a compromise verdict or finding;\r\n(6) Treating the issue as conclusively determined may complicate \r\n  determination of issues in the subsequent action or prejudice the interests \r\n  of another party thereto;\r\n(7) The issue is one of law and treating it as conclusively \r\n  determined would inappropriately foreclose opportunity for obtaining reconsideration \r\n  of the legal rule upon which it was based;\r\n(8) Other compelling circumstances make it appropriate that \r\n  the party be permitted to relitigate the issue.\r\n\r\nBeall, 281 S.C. at 371, 315 S.E.2d at 190-91.\r\nNelson contends the circuit court erred when it \r\n  granted the motion to dismiss on res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds \r\n  because the parties in the two actions were not the same, the summary judgment \r\n  order in the first case was not an adjudication on the merits, an order entered \r\n  into by consent does not trigger res judicata or collateral estoppel, public \r\n  policy considerations preclude the use of res judicata and collateral estoppel, \r\n  and Nelson did not get the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the issues \r\n  in the first action.\r\nA.Â  Identity of the Parties\r\nNelson asserts the parties are not the \r\n  same in the two lawsuits because Nelson is represented by a different guardian \r\n  ad litem in the respective suits and the 1996 complaint named the Carolina Womenâ€™s \r\n  Center and Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. as defendants.Â  \r\nFor determining whether res judicata applies, \r\n  the identity of the parties in the first lawsuit also includes persons in privity \r\n  with the named parties.Â  Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  One not a party to a prior action can be precluded from relitigating \r\n  the issue only if he is in privity with a party to the prior action against \r\n  whom an adverse finding is made.Â  Roberts v. Recovery Bureau, Inc., 316 \r\n  S.C. 492, 450 S.E.2d 616 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In regard to res judicata or collateral \r\n  estoppel, privity â€œdoes not embrace relationships between persons or entities, \r\n  but rather it deals with a personâ€™s relationship to the subject matter of the \r\n  litigation.â€Â  Wyndam v. Lewis, 292 S.C. 6, 8, 354 S.E.2d 578, 579 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1987).Â  â€œPrivityâ€ means one so identified in interest with another that \r\n  he represents the same legal right.Â  Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 767 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. \r\n  311, 498 S.E.2d 684 (Ct. App. 1998), this court discussed privity by stating:\r\n\r\nPrivity deals with a personâ€™s relationship to the subject \r\n  matter of the previous litigation, not to the relationships between entities.Â  \r\n  To be in privity, a partyâ€™s legal interests must have been litigated in the \r\n  prior proceeding.Â  Having an interest in the same question or in proving or \r\n  disproving the same set of facts does not establish privity.Â  Nor is privity \r\n  found when the litigated question might affect a personâ€™s liability as a judicial \r\n  precedent in a subsequent action.\r\n\r\nId. at 317, 498 S.E.2d at 687 (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nThe viability and efficacy of one guardian ad litem \r\n  as juxtapose to a later appointed guardian ad litem in two different suits is \r\n  novel.Â  In Stevens v. Kelley, 134 P.2d 56 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1943), \r\n  a minor child brought an action through her guardian ad litem against her alleged \r\n  natural father to establish paternity and obtain child support.Â  The childâ€™s \r\n  mother had previously brought a suit to establish paternity against the same \r\n  man when the minor child was a three-month-old baby.Â  The mother entered into \r\n  an agreement to settle the suit for a cash payment.Â  The court found that according \r\n  to California statute, the mother was the childâ€™s guardian when the mother brought \r\n  the first suit.Â  The child argued that she was not bound by the judgment in \r\n  the first case because she was not a party in the first action and the first \r\n  case was compromised without the consent of the court in which it was tried.Â  \r\n  The court found the childâ€™s arguments to be meritless:Â  \r\n\r\nPlaintiffâ€™s rights, having been determined in an action in \r\n  her behalf brought by her mother, cannot be again litigated in an action brought \r\n  by her guardian ad litem. . . . \r\nIf the present judgment were allowed to stand, we would have \r\n  two judgments of the same court, adjudicating identical rights between the same \r\n  parties in interest, the second the exact opposite of the first.Â  Both cannot \r\n  be valid.Â  Where the defense of former adjudication was pleaded and the earlier \r\n  of the judgments was established by sufficient proof, it had to prevail over \r\n  the later judgment unless it was . . . vulnerable to attack upon equitable grounds.\r\n\r\nId. at 59.Â  The court additionally found \r\n  the motherâ€™s actions in the first suit did not improperly compromise the childâ€™s \r\n  interests.Â  Id. at 61.\r\nHere, the minor child was the injured \r\n  party in interest in both lawsuits.Â  The identity of the guardian changed, but \r\n  the basic facts underlying the cause of action remained identical and required \r\n  the presence of the child.Â  There is no question that a minor ward and her guardian \r\n  are in privity with each other.Â  First Natâ€™l Bank of Greenville v. United \r\n  States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, 26, 35 S.E.2d 47, 57 (1945) (â€œ[W]e \r\n  do not think there could be a much clearer case of mutual relationship \r\n  than that existing between a ward and her guardian.â€).\r\nRes judicata applies to bar the action \r\n  against Thomas W. Phillips, M.D., who was the named person in the first lawsuit.\r\nB.Â  Adjudication on the Merits\r\nNelson asserts that the circuit court \r\n  dismissed his first complaint on procedural grounds because his attorney failed \r\n  to comply with discovery orders; therefore, the order dismissing the first case \r\n  was not an adjudication on the merits and res judicata and collateral estoppel \r\n  do not apply to bar this case.\r\nMedical malpractice is the failure of \r\n  a physician to exercise that degree of care and skill which is ordinarily employed \r\n  by the profession generally, under similar conditions and in like surrounding \r\n  circumstances.Â  Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 440 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. \r\n  1993); Welch v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 251, 317 S.E.2d 758 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\n  A plaintiff must show the physician failed to exercise the degree of care and \r\n  skill which is ordinarily employed by the profession under similar conditions \r\n  and in like circumstances.Â  Keaton v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. \r\n  488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999).Â  In South Carolina, to sustain a cause of action \r\n  in a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff is required to establish the relevant \r\n  standard of care and a breach of the standard of care by expert witness testimony.Â  \r\n  Pederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 341 S.E.2d 633 (1986); Botehlo v. \r\n  Bycura, 282 S.C. 578, 320 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Gooding v. St. \r\n  Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 487 S.E.2d 596 (1997), articulates the \r\n  quintessential mandate thrust upon a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case.Â  \r\n  Gooding inculcates:\r\n\r\n[T]he plaintiff must present (1) evidence of the generally \r\n  recognized practice and procedures that would be exercised by competent practitioners \r\n  in a defendant doctorâ€™s field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances \r\n  and (2) evidence that the defendant doctor departed from the recognized and \r\n  generally accepted standards, practices, and procedures in the manner alleged \r\n  by the plaintiff.Â  Further, unless the subject is a matter of common knowledge, \r\n  the plaintiff must use expert testimony to establish both the standard of care \r\n  and the defendantâ€™s failure to conform to that standard.\r\n\r\nId. at 254, 487 S.E.2d at 599.\r\nA case that is dismissed â€œwith prejudiceâ€ indicates \r\n  an adjudication on the merits and, pursuant to res judicata, prohibits subsequent \r\n  litigation to the same extent as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.Â  \r\n  Lawlor v. Natâ€™l Screen Serv. Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. \r\n  1122 (1955); Nunnery v. Brantley Constr. Co., 289 S.C. 205, 345 S.E.2d \r\n  740 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  When an action has been dismissed with prejudice, the \r\n  judgment operates in subsequent litigation to the same extent as if the action \r\n  had been tried to a final adjudication.Â  Jones v. City of Folly Beach, \r\n  326 S.C. 360, 483 S.E.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  If the first case is dismissed \r\n  with prejudice on purely procedural grounds without a consideration of the underlying \r\n  merits of the action, then the party is barred from asserting collateral estoppel \r\n  or res judicata.Â  Id.; see also Sealy v. Dodge, 289 S.C. \r\n  543, 347 S.E.2d 504 (1986) (holding that a medical malpractice action was not \r\n  barred by res judicata where the initial action did not involve an adjudication \r\n  on the merits but instead involved the childâ€™s capacity to sue and whether there \r\n  was an improper joinder of the causes of action).\r\nNelson contends that the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  dismissal was for failure to comply with the courtâ€™s extensions of time to present \r\n  expert witness testimony and was procedural rather than substantive.Â  The circuit \r\n  court, however, did not dismiss the case for failure to comply with its extensions \r\n  in a timely fashion, but ultimately dismissed the case because of Nelsonâ€™s failure \r\n  to present an expert.Â  South Carolina law requires an expert witness in medical \r\n  malpractice cases.Â  When the circuit court dismissed the case for lack of expert \r\n  testimony, it was a dismissal on the merits because Nelson failed to sustain \r\n  his burden of proof.Â  The circuit court did not err when it dismissed Thomas \r\n  W. Phillips, M.D. because the identity of the parties in the two suits was the \r\n  same and the first lawsuit was disposed of by an adjudication on the merits.\r\nWe conclude granting summary judgment \r\n  in favor of a physician in a medical malpractice case because of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  failure to produce an expert witness as to the applicable standard of care and \r\n  departure from the standard of care by the physician is an adjudication of the \r\n  case on the merits.Â  We reject the contention of Nelson that this factual scenario \r\n  is only a discovery delinquency and does not rise to the level of a disposition \r\n  on the merits.Â  \r\nOur decision on this issue is efficacious \r\n  as to Thomas W. Phillips, M.D., but not as to Drs. Coker, Phillips, and \r\n  Haswell, P.A.\r\nC.Â  Consent Order\r\nNelson argues that when his counsel consented \r\n  to the summary judgment order in the first action, the consent barred the use \r\n  of collateral estoppel or res judicata in this action.\r\nBecause a consent judgment has substantially \r\n  the same effect as any other judgment rendered in the ordinary course, it is \r\n  generally entitled to the defense of res judicata.Â  46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments \r\n  Â§ 222 (1994).Â  However, even in consent orders, the public policy underlying \r\n  res judicata may have to yield to other public policies.Â  Johns v. Johns, \r\n  309 S.C. 199, 420 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 1992); James F. Flanagan, South Carolina \r\n  Civil Procedure 654 (2d ed. 1996).Â  In Johns, a husband and wife \r\n  signed a consent order where the family court found they were married at common \r\n  law and ordered their legal separation.Â  At the time the parties entered into \r\n  the consent order, the husband was married to another person.Â  The wife brought \r\n  suit against the husband seeking a divorce, custody of the coupleâ€™s child, an \r\n  increase in alimony and child support, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The husband contested \r\n  the divorce, arguing the parties were not married.Â  The wife sought to use the \r\n  consent order declaring they were married at common law to bar the husbandâ€™s \r\n  defense under res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds.Â  This court did \r\n  not allow the wife to assert res judicata or collateral estoppel to bar the \r\n  husbandâ€™s defense because public policy declaring bigamous marriages void overrode \r\n  the policy concerns for res judicata.&nbsp; \r\n Johns is inapposite to this case, \r\n  however.Â  Nelson misconstrues the nature of his consent in the first case.Â  \r\n  The circuit court imposed monetary sanctions against Nelsonâ€™s counsel for discovery \r\n  abuse.Â  Nelsonâ€™s counsel consented to the imposition of monetary sanctions.Â  \r\n  He did not consent to the grant of the summary judgment motion.Â  In Johns, \r\n  the consent order was directly on point as to what was in dispute in the second \r\n  case.Â  There was no effective consent given allowing the entry of summary judgment \r\n  and the general rule disallowing the use of res judicata or collateral estoppel \r\n  for consent orders does not apply.\r\nFor the sake of clarity, this conclusion \r\n  applies only to Thomas W. Phillips, M.D., but not to Drs. Coker, Phillips, \r\n  and Haswell, P.A.\r\nD.Â  Inadequate Representation in the First Suit\r\nNelson contends that his counselâ€™s representation \r\n  in the first suit was inadequate so the doctrines of res judicata and collateral \r\n  estoppel should not apply.\r\nIn Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, \r\n  480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997), the appellant raised the issue that collateral \r\n  estoppel should not apply because of an inadequate defense and failing to identify \r\n  witnesses in the first action.Â  This court rejected that argument stating:\r\n\r\n[Appellant] presented no affidavits or depositions to the \r\n  trial court regarding the purported testimony of the alleged additional witnesses.Â  \r\n  Further, prior to the federal action, both parties had a substantial amount \r\n  of time to prepare for trial and conduct extensive discovery.Â  Both cases had \r\n  been on the docket for well over a year prior to the [first action].\r\n\r\nId. at 439, 480 S.E.2d at 461.Â  Inadequate \r\n  representation is not a basis for attacking res judicata.Â  In re Fuhrman, \r\n  118 B.R. 72 (E.D. Mich. 1990).Â  In Dennis v. First State Bank of Texas, \r\n  989 S.W.2d 22 (Tex. App. 1998), the Texas Court of Appeals stated:\r\n\r\nTo allow appellants another chance to relitigate the issues \r\n  that should have been brought in the [first suit] would circumvent the purpose \r\n  behind the doctrine of res judicata and would allow a losing party to relitigate \r\n  a cause of action based solely on an assertion of inadequate representation.Â  \r\n  The doctrine of res judicata does not allow for such a result.\r\n\r\nId. at 28.\r\nNelsonâ€™s attorney had ample time to develop \r\n  witnesses. Â The circuit court even granted additional days after the entry of \r\n  summary judgment to present an expert witness with a motion for reconsideration.\r\nWhile we sympathize with Nelson and agree \r\n  that the first attorneyâ€™s conduct in handling the case was reprehensible, the \r\n  proper course of action to rectify the attorneyâ€™s behavior is legal malpractice \r\n  and not punishing the opposing party by suspending the operation of res judicata \r\n  or collateral estoppel.\r\nFor the sake of clarity, this conclusion applies \r\n  only to Thomas W. Phillips, M.D., but not to Drs. Coker, Phillips, and \r\n  Haswell, P.A.\r\nE.Â  Policy Considerations\r\nNelson asserts public policy considerations \r\n  should bar Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. \r\n  from invoking the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata.\r\nThe doctrines of collateral estoppel and \r\n  res judicata exist to â€œreduce litigation and conserve the resources of the court \r\n  and litigants and it is based upon the notion that it is unfair to permit a \r\n  party to relitigate an issue that has already been decided.â€Â  State v. Bacote, \r\n  331 S.C. 328, 331, 503 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1998).Â  Even when the elements of res \r\n  judicata and collateral estoppel have been met, they will not be rigidly or \r\n  mechanically applied, and the application of the doctrines may be precluded \r\n  where unfairness or injustice results, or public policy requires it.Â  Id.; \r\n  Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 552 S.E.2d 767 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThus \r\n  application of res judicata will not be applied where it will contravene other \r\n  important public policies; the courts must weigh the competing public policies.â€Â  \r\n  Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 203, 420 S.E.2d 856, 859 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\n  We recognize that there have been instances when collateral estoppel or res \r\n  judicata have not been invoked for countervailing public policy concerns.Â  See \r\n  Bacote, 331 S.C. at 331, 503 S.E.2d at 163 (declining to give collateral \r\n  estoppel effect to proceedings which occur during an administrative hearing \r\n  for a driverâ€™s license revocation); Shelton v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., \r\n  325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d 706 (1997) (finding that giving administrative hearings \r\n  held in front of the Employment Security Commission collateral estoppel effect \r\n  would frustrate the purposes of the Employment Security Commission); Johns, \r\n  309 S.C. at 203, 420 S.E.2d at 859 (refusing to apply a consent order entered \r\n  by the family court finding husband and wife married at common law because giving \r\n  the order collateral estoppel effect would violate the Stateâ€™s policy finding \r\n  bigamous marriages void as mandated by statute).Â  However, in these cases, collateral \r\n  estoppel was in conflict with existing public policy concerns. \r\nIn Bacote and Shelton, the public \r\n  policy weighed against res judicata was the efficiency and speed of administrative \r\n  procedures.Â  In Johns, the policy of res judicata was in direct contravention \r\n  with a statutorily expressed policy prohibiting bigamous marriages.Â  In this \r\n  case, Nelson merely states it would be unfair to impose collateral estoppel \r\n  or res judicata without expressing what public policy considerations are violated.Â  \r\n  Since we can see no existing public policy concerns in preventing litigation \r\n  for failure to provide sufficient proof in the first action, we find the summary \r\n  judgment order in the first action has collateral estoppel and res judicata \r\n  effect which does not run contrary to any public policy.Â  Consequently, the \r\n  circuit court was correct in finding the second suit against Thomas W. Phillips, \r\n  M.D. was barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.\r\nFor the sake of clarity, this conclusion applies \r\n  only to Thomas W. Phillips, M.D., but not to Drs. Coker, Phillips, and \r\n  Haswell, P.A.\r\nIV.Â  Master-Servant Liability\r\nNelson argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it found that Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, \r\n  P.A. were in a master-servant relationship and the master could not be found \r\n  liable when the servant was not liable.Â  We agree.\r\nNormally, a master cannot be held liable \r\n  for the actions of the servant if its liability is based solely upon the actions \r\n  of its servant.Â  Hundley v. Rite Aid of South Carolina, Inc., 339 S.C. \r\n  285, 529 S.E.2d 45 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  However, when a masterâ€™s liability is based \r\n  on its own conduct or the conduct of a non-defendant servant, an exoneration \r\n  of its defendant servant does not absolve it from liability.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Rite Aid, the plaintiff sued \r\n  the pharmacy and the pharmacist for damages that occurred from an improperly \r\n  filled prescription.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, \r\n  awarding the plaintiff punitive damages against the pharmacy, but not against \r\n  the pharmacist.Â  Rite Aid argued it could not be held liable for punitive damages \r\n  when the jury failed to find the pharmacistâ€™s action was willful because its \r\n  liability was predicated on the actions of its servant.Â  This court disagreed, \r\n  finding that the allegations in the complaint that Rite Aid negligently supervised \r\n  the pharmacist were a separate basis of liability independent of the pharmacistâ€™s \r\n  liability.Â  \r\nWe have reviewed the complaint in this \r\n  case and, giving Nelson the benefit of all reasonable inferences, as we must \r\n  when considering a motion to dismiss, we find that the claims against Drs. Coker, \r\n  Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. regarding the sufficiency of its medical record \r\n  keeping is an independent basis of liability separate from Thomas W. Phillips, \r\n  M.D.â€™s liability.Â  Therefore, Nelson may maintain the suit against Drs. Coker, \r\n  Phillips, and Haswell, P.A., even though Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. is not liable, \r\n  due to the entry of the summary judgment motion and Nelson voluntarily dismissing \r\n  Thomas W. Phillips, M.D.\r\nThis holding does not run afoul of either \r\n  of the cases cited by Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, Phillips, and \r\n  Haswell, P.A.Â  In Rookard v. Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line R.R., 84 \r\n  S.C. 190, 65 S.E. 1047 (1909), the plaintiff sued Atlanta for damages which \r\n  occurred in a railroad crossing accident.Â  Southern Railroad Company, a lessee \r\n  of Atlanta, was operating the rail line at the time of the accident.Â  The court \r\n  set forth the principle that â€œ[a] judgment on the merits in favor of the agent \r\n  is a bar to an action against the principal for the same cause, because the \r\n  principalâ€™s liability is predicated upon that of the agent.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  192, 65 S.E. at 1047.Â  The same principle is espoused in Logan v. Atlanta \r\n  &amp; Charlotte Air Line R.R., 82 S.C. 518, 64 S.E. 515 (1909): â€œWhere an \r\n  agent is sued, and, after trial on the merits, the issue is determined against \r\n  the plaintiff, the principal, though not a party to the suit, can avail himself \r\n  of the judgment as a bar, when sued by the same plaintiff on the same cause \r\n  of action.â€Â  Id. at 523, 64 S.E. at 516.Â  However, both of these cases \r\n  refer to barring liability for the master when the servant is found not liable \r\n  for the same cause of action brought against the master.Â  In this case, negligence \r\n  in keeping medical records and medical record procedures are separate from Thomas \r\n  W. Phillips, M.D.â€™s potential liability.Â  Rookard and Logan are \r\n  not germane.\r\nV.Â  Additional Sustaining Grounds\r\nThomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, \r\n  Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. assert as an additional sustaining ground that Nelsonâ€™s \r\n  suit is barred because it violates the statute of repose.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe complaint alleges the negligent medical \r\n  treatment arising from Nelsonâ€™s delivery occurred on March 5, 1993.Â  The complaint \r\n  was filed almost eight years later on February 26, 2001.Â  \r\nThe time limit to bring a cause of action \r\n  by a minor in a medical malpractice action is:\r\n\r\n(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15-3-40, if \r\n  a person entitled to bring an action against a licensed health care provider \r\n  acting within the scope of his profession is under the age of majority at the \r\n  date of the treatment, omission, or operation giving rise to the cause of action, \r\n  the time period or periods limiting filing the action are not tolled for a period \r\n  of more than seven years on account of minority, and in any case more than one \r\n  year after the disability ceases.Â  Such time limitation is tolled for minors \r\n  for any period during which parent or guardian and defendantâ€™s insurer or health \r\n  care provider have committed fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action \r\n  on behalf of the injured minor.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-545 (Supp. 2002).\r\nThomas W. Phillips, M.D. and Drs. Coker, \r\n  Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. contend that there is no allegation of fraud or \r\n  collusion by the parent or guardian with the defendants or their insurance companies \r\n  and therefore the statute clearly bars the suit.\r\nThis court has discretion on whether to address \r\n  additional sustaining grounds.Â  â€œ[A] respondent - - â€˜the winnerâ€™ in the lower \r\n  court - - may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should \r\n  affirm the lower courtâ€™s ruling, regardless of whether those reasons have been \r\n  presented to or ruled on by the lower court.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. \r\n  Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).Â Â  â€œAn appellate \r\n  court may not rely on Rule 220(c) SCACR, when the reason [supporting the additional \r\n  sustaining ground] does not appear in the record, or when the court believes \r\n  it would be unwise or unjust to do so in a particular case.Â  It is within the \r\n  appellate courtâ€™s discretion whether to address any additional sustaining grounds.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 420, 526 S.E.2d at 723.Â  â€œWhile the current rules do not require \r\n  the respondent to present an issue to the lower court in order to raise it as \r\n  an additional sustaining ground, an appellate court is less likely to rely on \r\n  such a ground when the respondent has failed to present it to the lower court.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 421, 526 S.E.2d at 724.\r\nWe decline to address this issue in the present \r\n  case because the issue was presented by Thomas W. Phillips, M.D.â€™s motion to \r\n  dismiss, and therefore Drs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A. lacked standing \r\n  to argue this issue in front of the circuit court and it would be inequitable \r\n  for us to address this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A), SCRCP, \r\n  a plaintiff may dismiss an action without order of court by filing and serving \r\n  a notice of dismissal before service by the adverse party of an answer or notice \r\n  of appearance.Â  A voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A) is efficacious \r\n  against a defendant who has not answered or made an appearance, even though \r\n  another defendant has answered and made an appearance.Â  Once a voluntary dismissal \r\n  under Rule 41(a)(1)(A) has been filed and served before service by the adverse \r\n  party of an answer or notice of appearance, the circuit court lacks jurisdiction \r\n  over the dismissed party and the dismissed party has no standing to subsequently \r\n  file a motion to dismiss.\r\nWe rule that a minor is the plaintiff in an action \r\n  and the fact that there are two different guardians ad litem is irrelevant to \r\n  the privity element in a res judicata/collateral estoppel analysis.\r\nWe reverse the order of the circuit judge \r\n  dismissing â€œDrs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, P.A.â€ with prejudice \r\n  and   remand the case against â€œDrs. Coker, Phillips, and Haswell, \r\n  P.A.â€ for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nFinally, we reverse the order of the circuit \r\n  judge dismissing Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. with prejudice because the plaintiff \r\n  had previously filed a voluntary dismissal of Thomas W.

Shull, III, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  James Pendergast (Father) \r\n  appeals the family court order which failed to reduce his unallocated support \r\n  obligation following the graduation from college of the partiesâ€™ child, and \r\n  also required him to contribute $6,000 toward Charlene Pendergastâ€™s (Mother) \r\n  attorney fees.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\n FACTS\r\nThe parties were married in 1970, had \r\n  a child in 1979, and were divorced in 1980 in New York.Â  The original decree \r\n  specified alimony and child support, which was later recast as unallocated support \r\n  pursuant to a 1984 consent order in New York.Â  Father relocated to South Carolina, \r\n  but Mother and child remained in New York. Â In 1997, a South Carolina family \r\n  court continued this characterization of Fatherâ€™s support obligations in a subsequent \r\n  consent order.Â  \r\nIn the present action, the family court \r\n  terminated Fatherâ€™s child support obligation. Â However, it refused to \r\n  reduce Fatherâ€™s unallocated support because he had shown no change in circumstances \r\n  warranting a reduction in the support paid to Mother, and further held that \r\n  the unallocated support was now clearly alimony.Â  The court found Motherâ€™s recurring \r\n  monthly expenses were reasonable and found the fact that the partiesâ€™ child \r\n  was emancipated did not provide a basis for reducing or terminating alimony \r\n  and that Mother had received no increase in support since 1980 while Fatherâ€™s \r\n  income had substantially increased.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this \r\n  court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are we required to ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 \r\n  (1981).Â  Furthermore, our broad scope of review does not â€œrelieve the appellant \r\n  of the burden of convincing this Court that the family court committed error.â€Â  \r\n  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Apportionment of Unallocated Support\r\nFather argues that the family court erred \r\n  by not reducing his unallocated support obligation by the portion attributable \r\n  to child support, which the family court terminated.Â  Father further argues \r\n  that the court is required to allocate the support between child support and \r\n  alimony under section 20-3-150.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-150 (1976 &amp; Supp. \r\n  2001).Â  We disagree with this application of the law based on the facts of this \r\n  case.Â  \r\n  In the absence of South Carolina authority on \r\n  point, we find it helpful to look to other jurisdictions for guidance.Â  â€œ[A]n \r\n  alimony award given for the support of a wife and her children is an award to \r\n  the group as a family unit and cannot automatically be prorated among the wife \r\n  and children upon the happening of some contingent event regarding the children, \r\n  . . . except as specifically provided in the decree.â€Â  Van Dyck v. \r\n  Van Dyck, 429 S.E.2d 914, 916 (Ga. 1993).Â  Such an award is subject to modification \r\n  based on the changes in financial circumstances of the parties because of events \r\n  involving the children.Â  Id. at 916-17.Â  However, the reduced support \r\n  obligation presented by a childâ€™s emancipation may be offset by changes in circumstances \r\n  affecting the remaining support obligations.Â  See Graffeo v. Graffeo, \r\n  180 N.Y.S.2d 844 (N.Y. App. Div. 1958) (denying modification where the fact \r\n  that one child had become self-supporting was offset by a change in circumstances \r\n  due to the increased cost of maintaining the other child); Barker v. Barker, \r\n  45 N.Y.S.2d 809 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1943) (continuing the original allowance for \r\n  the benefit of the wife, who was afflicted with a chronic ailment which rendered \r\n  her unable to work, even though one of the daughters had married and the other \r\n  was employed, the original award in a separation being for the support of the \r\n  wife and the two daughters).\r\nHere, a New York consent order subsequent \r\n  to the divorce decree changed the support from child support and alimony to \r\n  unallocated support, and the 1997 South Carolina enforcement order continued \r\n  that characterization.Â  Fatherâ€™s time to appeal these underlying orders is long \r\n  past.Â  The award was both fully child support and fully alimony with no distinction \r\n  or proration.Â  Neither provided for automatic proration based upon the contingent \r\n  event of the partiesâ€™ childâ€™s emancipation.Â  \r\nThe family court in the order under appeal \r\n  held that the support is clearly alimony and should now be characterized as \r\n  such.Â  The amount of alimony is within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and \r\n  â€œwill not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.â€Â  Smith \r\n  v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 627-28, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975).Â  Father deducted \r\n  amounts paid on his income taxes as alimony.Â  The family court was therefore \r\n  correct in holding that the entire amount is alimony.Â  \r\nII.Â  Reduction of Alimony\r\nFather asserted a material and substantial \r\n  change of circumstances had occurred because the partiesâ€™ child was now emancipated \r\n  and Motherâ€™s living and housing expenses had reduced substantially while she \r\n  was earning more money than at the time of the divorce hearing and no longer \r\n  required support.Â  Thus, Father argues he is entitled to termination or modification \r\n  of alimony.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina law authorizes a spouse \r\n  to request modification of alimony based upon a change of circumstances.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2001).Â  After a hearing in which the \r\n  parties are given the opportunity to be heard and present evidence, the family \r\n  court may â€œmake such order and judgment as justice and equity shall require, \r\n  with due regard to the changed circumstances and the financial ability of the \r\n  supporting spouse, decreasing or increasing or confirming the amount of alimony \r\n  provided for in such original judgment or terminating such payments.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1976).\r\nThe determination â€œâ€˜of whether to increase \r\n  or decrease support based on a finding of changed circumstances is a matter \r\n  committed to the sound discretion of the family court.â€™â€ Â Thornton v. Thornton, \r\n  328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997) (quoting Brunner v. Brunner, \r\n  296 S.C. 60, 64, 370 S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Thus, â€œthe family courtâ€™s \r\n  determination whether to modify support will not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\n  the family court abused its discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  To justify modification, \r\n  the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  Id.Â  We \r\n  find the family court did not abuse its discretion in determining there has \r\n  been no substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of alimony.Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court found that the childâ€™s \r\n  completing college would do relatively little to decrease Motherâ€™s expenses \r\n  or cost of living.Â  In spite of childâ€™s graduation from college, we find no \r\n  evidence in the record that Motherâ€™s monthly expenses would decrease.Â  Moreover, \r\n  in the twenty years since the divorce, Mother never sought a cost-of-living \r\n  increase.Â  Her income and standard of living has remained relatively unchanged, \r\n  whereas Fatherâ€™s income and concomitant ability to pay alimony has substantially \r\n  increased.Â  Father argued that Motherâ€™s living circumstances had changed and \r\n  asserted that she was living with a man.Â  The family court found, and we agree, \r\n  that Fatherâ€™s own investigatorâ€™s findings support Motherâ€™s testimony that she \r\n  is living in the basement of a single family home and moved out of her apartment \r\n  and sublet it because gangs had moved into the neighborhood.Â  We agree this \r\n  evidence does not support a decrease in Fatherâ€™s monthly alimony obligation. \r\n\r\nIII.Â  Attorney Fees\r\nFather argues that because much of Motherâ€™s \r\n  attorneyâ€™s time was devoted to her motions which were denied, she has not prevailed \r\n  and should not be awarded partial attorney fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe award of attorney fees is within \r\n  the discretion of the court.â€Â  Hardwick v. Hardwick, 303 S.C. 256, 261, \r\n  399 S.E.2d 791, 794 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In determining whether to award attorney \r\n  fees, the Court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective financial \r\n  conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. \r\n  v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1992).Â  In determining \r\n  the amount of attorney fees to award, the court should consider the nature, \r\n  extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted \r\n  to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  \r\n  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\n\r\nFather sued Mother in South Carolina \r\n  to reduce the support.Â  She was required to take time from work and defend the \r\n  action in South Carolina.Â  Her defense of the alimony reduction action was successful.Â  \r\n  Moreover, the court found Father chose to bring this action in South Carolina \r\n  and had the income to afford attorney fees, whereas Mother did not without substantially \r\n  impacting her standard of living.Â  The family court ordered Father to pay part \r\n  but not all of Motherâ€™s attorney fees.Â  It is apparent from the record that \r\n  the judge appropriately considered the Glasscock factors in determining \r\n  the amount of attorney fees to award.Â  The court did not err in requiring Father \r\n  to contribute $6,000 toward Motherâ€™s attorney fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the courtâ€™s findings are supported \r\n  by the evidence and the record and are not affected by any error of law, the \r\n  order of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3628","title":"State v.

Giese, all of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  Wayne Wright was convicted \r\n  of attempted second-degree burglary.Â  Wright appeals, arguing the indictment \r\n  was insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction, and the State violated \r\n  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), by improperly striking a juror \r\n  based on racial considerations. We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDRUAL BACKGROUND\r\nA grand jury indicted Wright for attempted first-degree \r\n  burglary.Â  The caption of the indictment stated, â€œAttempted Burglary (Dwelling) \r\n  FIRST DEGREE Common Law â€“ No Classification,â€ and the text of the indictment \r\n  alleged:\r\n\r\nThat Tony Wayne Wright AKA Wayne Bruce Wright did in Richland \r\n  County on or about June 7, 2000 attempted [sic] to enter the dwelling of Marion \r\n  Summers without consent and with the intent to commit a crime therein and the \r\n  defendant has two or more prior convictions for burglary and/or housebreaking \r\n  or a combination thereof . . . .\r\n\r\nWhen the case was called for trial, the State exercised peremptory \r\n  challenges to strike three black jurors.Â  Wright objected and requested a Batson \r\n  hearing.Â  The State averred Juror 22 and Juror 163 were dismissed because they \r\n  had criminal records.Â  Neither strike is in contention here.Â  As to the dismissal \r\n  of Juror 29, the assistant solicitor gave the following explanation:\r\n\r\nHer employment is listed as a bilingual translator.Â  We didnâ€™t \r\n  seat any other translators for sure.Â  And just based on her accent, I donâ€™t \r\n  know, I just am not sure of her command of the English language.Â  My first -- \r\n  my gut instinct was that, even though she is a translator, she might not have, \r\n  you know, just based on her accent, I donâ€™t know where she is from, if she is \r\n  from the United States, and that just gave me some cause of concern.Â  \r\n\r\nResponding to the Stateâ€™s explanation, \r\n  Wrightâ€™s counsel noted the State did not strike Juror 123 who was German and \r\n  had a â€œhuge accent.â€Â  The State responded:\r\n\r\n[Juror 29] was just more soft-spoken than [Juror 123], but \r\n  -- And maybe Iâ€™m just misreading her employment.Â  I got the sense that [Juror \r\n  123] was sort of -- she indicated that she worked for the fire department.Â  \r\n  She is some sort of computer operator.Â  I got the sense from that that she was \r\n  some sort of -- I wonâ€™t say 911 operator, but something to do with communications \r\n  between the fire department and the public.Â  I could be misreading her employment, \r\n  but I felt because that that was her line of work she was probably more in tune \r\n  with, you know, the English language than the [Juror 29].\r\n\r\nThe State further explained:\r\n\r\nI didnâ€™t have any information that [Juror 123] was from Germany, \r\n  and in fact at the jury qualification she indicated that she worked at the fire \r\n  department, that is why I made that connection because she works on computers \r\n  and she works at the fire department that she must do some sort of communications \r\n  there akin to 911 operations.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court ultimately ruled the Stateâ€™s \r\n  peremptory strikes did not violate Batson, and the jury was seated and \r\n  sworn.Â  Wright was convicted of attempted second-degree burglary and sentenced \r\n  to fifteen years imprisonment.Â  Wright appeals.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Indictment\r\nWright argues the indictment does not \r\n  confer subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court because common law burglary \r\n  requires that the entry occur during the nighttime. State v. Washington, \r\n  338 S.C. 392, 397, 526 S.E.2d 709, 711 (2000). Wright argues the indictment \r\n  contains no allegation that the entry was attempted at night, and since the \r\n  caption and body of the indictment label the offense as attempted burglary â€“ \r\n  common law, it fails to sufficiently allege the elements of the offense.Â  We \r\n  disagree with this reading of the indictment.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction may be raised \r\n  at any time by the parties or sua sponte by the court.Â  See State \r\n  v. Castleman, 219 S.C. 136, 139, 64 S.E.2d 250, 252 (1951).Â  The circuit \r\n  court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant of an \r\n  offense unless there is an indictment that sufficiently states the offense, \r\n  the defendant waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser-included offense \r\n  of the crime charged in the indictment.Â Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, \r\n  648, 552 S.E.2d 745, 751 (2001).Â  â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment \r\n  is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains \r\n  the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently \r\n  apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  Browning v. \r\n  State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe caption of the indictment reads, â€œAttempted \r\n  Burglary (Dwelling) FIRST DEGREE Common Law â€“ No Classification.â€Â  \r\nUntil 1985, burglary was a common-law offense. See \r\n  Patricia Seets Watson &amp; William Shepard McAninch, Guide to South Carolina \r\n  Criminal Law and Procedure, 270-71 (4th ed. 1994).Â  Common law \r\n  burglary did not have separate degrees.Â  See Washington, 338 S.C. \r\n  at 397, 526 S.E.2d at 711.\r\nIn 1985, the South Carolina legislature enacted South Carolina \r\n  Code Annotated section 16-11-311 (2003), which divided the offense into three \r\n  degrees of burglary, including first-degree burglary.Â  See Guide to \r\n  South Carolina Criminal Law and Procedure, supra, at 270-71.Â  First \r\n  degree burglary is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n(A) A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if \r\n  the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime \r\n  in the dwelling, and either:\r\n  \r\n  (1) when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or \r\n  in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n  (a) is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive;Â  or\r\n  (b) causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant \r\n  in the crime;Â  or\r\n  (c) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument;Â  \r\n  or\r\n  (d) displays what is or appears to be a knife, pistol, revolver, \r\n  rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm;Â  or\r\n  (2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record \r\n  of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of \r\n  both;Â  or\r\n  (3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (2003).\r\nThe indictment accused Wright of attempting to commit first-degree \r\n  burglary.Â  Although first-degree burglary is a statutory offense, an attempt \r\n  to commit the crime is a common-law offense.Â  See William S. McAninch \r\n  &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina, 354 (3d ed. \r\n  1996); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-80 (2003) (â€œA person who commits \r\n  the common law offense of attempt, upon conviction, must be punished as for \r\n  the principal offense.â€).Â  Thus, the State accused Wright of the common-law \r\n  offense of attempting to commit the statutorily defined crime of burglary in \r\n  the first degree.Â  Therefore, for the indictment to be sufficient to confer \r\n  jurisdiction, the State was required to allege the elements of both attempt \r\n  and first-degree burglary, not attempt and common-law burglary.\r\nThe indictment alleges Wright attempted to enter \r\n  the dwelling of another, without consent, and with the intent to commit a crime.Â  \r\n  The indictment also alleges Wright has two or more prior convictions for burglary \r\n  and/or housebreaking, or a combination of the two.Â  These allegations are sufficient \r\n  to allege attempted first-degree burglary, [1]  and the circuit court had subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction. [2] \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Batson \r\n  Violation\r\nWright argues the circuit court erred by allowing \r\n  the State to exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner \r\n  in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â  \r\nIt is well settled â€œ[t]he Equal Protection Clause \r\n  of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the \r\n  striking of a venire person on the basis of race.â€Â  State v. Shuler, \r\n  344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 811 (2001).Â  When one party strikes a member \r\n  of a cognizable racial group, the circuit court must, upon request by the opposing \r\n  party, hold a Batson hearing.Â  See State v. Haigler, 334 \r\n  S.C. 623, 629, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90-91 (1999).Â  The proponent of the strike, to \r\n  successfully rebut the presumption of a Batson violation, must then offer \r\n  a race-neutral explanation. Id. The opponent must then show the race-neutral \r\n  explanation was mere pretext, which can be established by showing the proponent \r\n  did not strike a similarly situated member of another race.Â  Id.\r\n Whether a Batson violation has \r\n  occurred must be determined by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances \r\n  in the record.Â Â  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810.Â  The opponent \r\n  of the strike carries the ultimate burden of persuading the circuit court the \r\n  challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner.Â  State v. \r\n  Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 124, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996).Â Â  \r\nThe record indicates Wright timely objected to \r\n  the Stateâ€™s peremptory strikes.Â  Thereafter, the State averred a race-neutral \r\n  reason for each of the peremptory strikes.Â  Specifically, as to Juror 29, the \r\n  State explained that although she was a bilingual translator, she had a heavy \r\n  accent, and the State was unsure as to her command of the English language.Â  \r\n  Wright then responded the State did not strike Juror 123, a white German woman \r\n  who also had a â€œhuge accent.â€Â  The State countered that it was under the impression \r\n  Juror 123 worked in communications at the fire department and would thus have \r\n  a better grasp of the English language.Â  Based on this dialogue, the circuit \r\n  court found the Stateâ€™s peremptory strike did not violate Batson.Â  \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s findings regarding purposeful \r\n  discrimination rest largely on its evaluation of demeanor and credibility, matters \r\n  within the peculiar province of the circuit court.Â  Sumpter v. State, \r\n  312 S.C. 221, 224, 439 S.E.2d 842, 844 (1994); Hernandez v. New York, \r\n  500 U.S. 325, 364 (1991) (holding often the demeanor of the challenged attorney \r\n  will be the best and only evidence of discrimination, and â€œevaluation of the \r\n  prosecutorâ€™s mind lies peculiarly within a circuit courtâ€™s provinceâ€).Â  Even \r\n  though we are skeptical of the reasons advanced by the striking party, we will \r\n  not disturb the decision of the circuit court unless its ruling is clearly erroneous.Â  \r\n  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810; see also Hernandez, \r\n  500 U.S. at 365 (holding the United States Supreme Court, when reviewing a state \r\n  courtâ€™s decision on a Batson claim, will use the clearly erroneous standard). \r\n\r\nViewing the record in light of our standard of review, \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion was not clearly erroneous.Â  Although we recognize \r\n  Juror 29 and Juror 123 are similarly situated in that they both have foreign \r\n  accents, the State distinguished them by their observable command of the English \r\n  language, as well as what the State perceived their occupations to be.Â  These \r\n  were proper race-neutral considerations.Â  See Matthews v. Evatt, \r\n  105 F.3d 907, 918 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding the State is allowed to consider \r\n  tone, demeanor, facial expression, and any other race-neutral factors when striking \r\n  jurors).Â  Thus, the circuit court did not err. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, Wrightâ€™s conviction for attempted \r\n  second-degree burglary is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n CURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nÂ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Furthermore, even assuming the \r\n    caption was defective, there is no jurisdictional flaw.Â  See Tate \r\n    v. State, 345 S.C. 577, 581, 549 S.E.2d 601, 603 (2001) (â€œIt is the body \r\n    of the indictment rather than its caption that is important.Â  If the body \r\n    specifically states the essential elements of the crime and is otherwise free \r\n    from defect, defect in the caption will not cause it to be invalid.â€ (quoting \r\n    State v.

Edwards, and Long Point Farms, LLC, (collectively \r\n  referred to as â€œEdwardsâ€) alleging breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, breach of \r\n  contract, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, constructive trust, \r\n  unjust enrichment, tortious interference with contractual relations, breach \r\n  of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, violations of the South Carolina \r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act, civil conspiracy, and rescission or reformation \r\n  of the contract.Â  The causes of action arise from the withdrawal of Edwards \r\n  from the Partnership and his subsequent purchase of property believed by McDaniel \r\n  to be a partnership opportunity.Â  McDaniel appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of \r\n  summary judgment to Edwards.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Partnership was formed on December 16, 1996, by filing a Certificate \r\n  of Limited Partnership in the Office of the Secretary of State.Â  The formal \r\n  agreement of Redwend Limited Partnership is dated February 6, 1997.Â  The Partnership \r\n  planned to acquire and develop land for resale.\r\nEdwards and McDaniel were both active in the Partnership.Â  At the outset, McDaniel \r\n  and another partner, Wendswept, [1]  contributed property to the Partnership for \r\n  development.Â  According to McDaniel, Edwards agreed, as his contribution, to \r\n  acquire for the Partnership two specific tracts of land, the Boone Tract and \r\n  the Eddy Farm, which could be developed by the Partnership.Â  The purpose of \r\n  the Partnership is delineated in paragraph 3.1 of the Partnership Agreement:\r\n\r\n3.1 Purpose. The character of the business and the purposes of \r\n  the Partnership are:\r\n  \r\na) To acquire, own, develop and sell the Rhettâ€™s Crossing Tract, the Stono Tract \r\n  and the Boone Tract . . . and in connection therewith to lease and/or acquire \r\n  or deal with such real and personal property as necessary for the conduct of \r\n  its business and to engage in all other lawful activity in support of its business; \r\n  and\r\nb) To reinvest the proceeds of sales and proceeds of capital contributions and/or \r\n  loans in additional tracts of land or real estate of any nature or other property \r\n  of any nature or kind, real or personal, tangible or intangible as is deemed \r\n  to be in the best interest of the Partners as determined in good faith by the \r\n  General Partner; and\r\nc) To conduct any business and engage in any other activity whatsoever deemed \r\n  to be lawful and desirable by the General Partner.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Partnership purchased the Boone tract and developed it as planned.Â  \r\n  During the Partnership, McDaniel and Edwards traveled together to the Eddy Farm \r\n  on numerous occasions.Â  Edwards, using John W. Patrick [2]  as a straw man buyer, made an \r\n  offer for the Eddy Farm property.Â  The contract to buy the Eddy Farm was dated \r\n  July 21, 1997.Â  Patrick was listed as the buyer.Â  Drayton Hastie, the attorney \r\n  for the Partnership, was listed on the contract as the closing attorney.Â  The \r\n  contract was executed during the course of the Partnership.Â  However, the property \r\n  was not purchased for the Partnership.Â  McDaniel declared Edwards told McDaniel \r\n  that he submitted a contract to procure the Eddy Farm property on behalf of \r\n  the Partnership in 1997.Â  McDaniel professed: â€œWe were trying to purchase the \r\n  [Eddy Farm] property as a partnership.Â  Thatâ€™s what I thought we were doing.â€Â  \r\n  Edwards disagreed with this assertion, claiming there was no effort by the Partnership \r\n  to buy the Eddy Farm.\r\nOn August 4, 1997, Edwards and his father created Long Point Farms, \r\n  LLC, which was in the business of acquiring property for development.Â  In June \r\n  1998, Long Point Farms, along with John W. Patrick, entered into an agreement \r\n  to purchase the Eddy Farm property.Â  Edwards stated the â€œactual buyerâ€ was â€œ[p]robably \r\n  Long Point Farms.â€\r\nÂ In July 1998, Edwards approached McDaniel about \r\n  withdrawing from the Partnership.Â  These discussions resulted in a handwritten \r\n  agreement of withdrawal.Â  The agreement included a provision that the Eddy Farm \r\n  property would remain a partnership opportunity and asset after Edwardsâ€™ withdrawal.Â  \r\n  Yet, according to McDanielâ€™s deposition testimony, at the August 5, 1998, meeting \r\n  where Edwards signed the withdrawal agreement, Edwards told McDaniel the Eddy \r\n  Farm property was lost to other purchasers and should be omitted from the August \r\n  5 withdrawal agreement.Â  McDaniel stated that Edwards told him â€œthe lawyers \r\n  from the estate got it.â€Â  McDaniel averred he relied on what Edwards \r\n  told him and agreed to strike through the provision establishing the Eddy Farm \r\n  property as a partnership opportunity and prohibiting Edwards from competing \r\n  for the property.Â  The scratched-through provision in the agreement then referenced \r\n  â€œonly [the] Folly Beach Tractâ€ as a Partnership opportunity.Â  The August 5 withdrawal \r\n  agreement contained no merger clause.\r\nOn August 6, 1998, the day after Edwards withdrew from the Partnership, \r\n  Long Point Farms became the sole purchaser of the Eddy Farm.Â  The day after \r\n  informing McDaniel the Eddy Farm had been â€œlost,â€ Edwards finalized the purchase \r\n  of the property.Â  McDaniel was not aware that Edwards and his father had purchased \r\n  the Eddy Farm property until around April of 1999.\r\nMcDaniel and Edwards sent the August 5 agreement \r\n  to Hastie, the Partnership attorney, who telephoned McDaniel and asked him about \r\n  the scratched-out portion of the agreement.Â  McDaniel responded: â€œ[D]onâ€™t worry \r\n  about it, thatâ€™s a piece of property the partnership was trying to get and it \r\n  was sold to somebody else . . . so if itâ€™s been sold to somebody else thereâ€™s \r\n  no point in dealing with it.â€Â  Hastie declared â€œ[t]he contention was that the \r\n  only reason [the Eddy Farm] was marked out was that [Edwards] said that the \r\n  partnership opportunity had been lost because it had been sold to somebody else.â€\r\nA more formalized agreement was drafted by Hastie and presented to \r\n  the partners on October 6, 1998, in connection with the distribution of some \r\n  Partnership assets to Edwards.Â  This agreement, which was signed by the partners, \r\n  left out any provision regarding the Eddy Farm property.Â  The contract included \r\n  a non-competition clause which read:\r\n\r\n3.Â  No Competition. Edwards agrees that for a period of three (3) years \r\n  from the date hereof that he shall not, directly or indirectly, on his own behalf, \r\n  or as a partner, officer, executive, manager, employee, director, consultant, \r\n  shareholder or otherwise, engage in any activity which is in competition with \r\n  the Partnershipâ€™s attempt to acquire the Folly Beach Tract, develop the Folly \r\n  Beach Tract and sell property from the Folly Beach Tract.Â  It is agreed that \r\n  Edwards may compete with the Partnership with respect to the acquisition and \r\n  development of any other tract wherever located.\r\n\r\nThe October 6 withdrawal agreement included a merger clause.\r\n On October 7, 1998, Edwards and Long Point Farms closed on the purchase \r\n  of the Eddy Farm property.Â  The owners of the Eddy Farm tract executed deeds \r\n  to Long Point Farms prior to the October 6 withdrawal agreement being signed.Â  \r\n  Edwards had two lots in the Eddy Farm property â€œalready under contract to sellâ€ \r\n  prior to withdrawing from the Partnership.\r\nMcDaniel brought this suit alleging Edwards misappropriated a partnership \r\n  opportunity.Â  He asserted Edwards fraudulently concealed the truth regarding \r\n  the Eddy Farm property in order to have any provision related to it excluded \r\n  from the withdrawal agreement.Â  Finally, McDaniel maintained he relied on Edwardsâ€™ \r\n  misrepresentations in agreeing to remove the Eddy Farm property from the terms \r\n  of the withdrawal agreement.Â  After filing an answer and counterclaim, Edwards \r\n  moved for summary judgment.\r\nThe trial court found the October 6, 1998 withdrawal \r\n  agreement contained both a merger clause and a non-reliance clause.Â  The judge \r\n  concluded McDaniel contracted away the right to rely on the representation from \r\n  Edwards regarding the status of the Eddy Farm property.Â  The court ruled McDaniel \r\n  did not have the right to rely on the representation.Â  The court granted summary \r\n  judgment to Edwards based on the merger clause in the October 6 withdrawal agreement.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming \r\n  v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002); Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. \r\n  Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment is \r\n  appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and \r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is \r\n  no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., Op. \r\n  No. 25599 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 24, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 \r\n  at 28); Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 564 S.E.2d 358 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment \r\n  purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that can be reasonably drawn from \r\n  the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  \r\n  Cunningham v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003); \r\n  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 566 \r\n  S.E.2d 536 (2002); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  \r\n  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of \r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence \r\n  must be construed most strongly against the moving party. Bayle v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001); \r\n  see also Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, \r\n  563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002) (â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, \r\n  the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences \r\n  arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non&#8209;moving \r\n  party below.â€).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but \r\n  only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment \r\n  should be denied.Â  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 561 S.E.2d 654 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  Moreover, summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously \r\n  invoked so no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed \r\n  factual issues.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, \r\n  563 S.E.2d 331 (2002); Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 \r\n  S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcDaniel contends the trial court erred in finding the October 6, \r\n  1998 withdrawal agreement contained a non-reliance clause.Â  He maintains the \r\n  trial court erred in finding that, by signing the agreement with or without \r\n  a non-reliance clause, he was not justified in relying upon the representations \r\n  by Edwards regarding the loss of the Eddy Farm property.\r\nI.Â  â€œEntire Agreementâ€ Clause\r\nThe October 6 withdrawal agreement contained the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n9. Entire Agreement.Â  This Agreement contains the \r\n  entire agreement and understanding by and between Edwards and the Partnership \r\n  with respect to the subject matter hereof.Â  All prior agreements and negotiations \r\n  are merged herein, and if not set forth herein are duly waived.Â  Each party \r\n  agrees that representations, promises, agreements or understandings, written \r\n  or oral, not contained herein shall be of no force or effect.Â  No change \r\n  or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless the same \r\n  is in writing or signed by the party intended to be bound. . . .Â  (Emphasis \r\n  added.)\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the emphasized language above was a non-reliance \r\n  clause.Â  The court determined the clause was intended to waive the right of \r\n  either party to complain regarding the representations of the other party which \r\n  were not specifically set forth in the agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court relied on One-O-One Enters., Inc. v. Caruso, \r\n  848 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1988), for the proposition that one may not reasonably \r\n  rely on prior representations where the agreement â€œâ€˜supersede[s] any and all \r\n  previous understandings and agreements.â€™â€Â  Id. at 1286.Â  The District \r\n  of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals stated that because 1) the provision in \r\n  question was excluded in the final agreement and 2) the final agreement had \r\n  a merger clause, the parties could not reasonably rely upon alleged promises, \r\n  which were directly contradicted by the terms of the subsequent agreement.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nIn One-O-One, the parties, in a preliminary agreement, included \r\n  a provision â€œincorporating defendantsâ€™ prior representations regarding their \r\n  long-term commitment to the Rustler business.â€Â  Id. at 1284.Â  In the \r\n  final agreement, after vigorous negotiations regarding the provision and others, \r\n  the parties agreed to exclude the provision.Â  Id.Â  In the instant case, \r\n  however, the provision was not a negotiated position eliminated from the contract.Â  \r\n  Any reference to the Eddy Farm property was eliminated due to the representations \r\n  by Edwards.\r\nAdditionally, the court in One-O-One did not hold the clause \r\n  was a non-reliance clause, but that it was an integration or merger clause, \r\n  which barred resort to prior agreements.Â  In this case, the trial court found \r\n  the clause to be a non-reliance clause.Â  We hold the provision is not a non-reliance \r\n  clause, but merely an extension of the merger clause.\r\nIn the cases cited by Edwards regarding non-reliance clauses, the \r\n  language is much different from the clause in the instant case.Â  The typical \r\n  language of a non-reliance clause can be found in Rissman v. Rissman, \r\n  213 F.3d 381 (7th Cir. 2000).Â  The language used in that agreement stated: â€œThe \r\n  parties further declare that they have not relied upon any representation \r\n  of any party hereby released . . . or of their attorneys . . ., agents, or other \r\n  representatives concerning the nature or extent of their respective injuries \r\n  or damages.â€Â  Id. at 383 (emphasis added).Â  In Rissman, the parties \r\n  expressly agreed they did not rely.Â  The contract provided:Â  \r\n\r\n(a) no promise or inducement for this Agreement has been \r\n  made to him except as set forth herein; (b) this Agreement is executed . . . \r\n  freely and voluntarily, and without reliance upon any statement or representation \r\n  by Purchaser, the Company, any of the Affiliates or O.R. Rissman or any of their \r\n  attorneys or agents except as set forth herein; (c) he has read and fully understands \r\n  this Agreement and the meaning of its provisions; (d) he is legally competent \r\n  to enter into this Agreement and to accept full responsibility therefor; and \r\n  (e) he has been advised to consult with counsel before entering into this Agreement \r\n  and has had the opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).Â  The parties in Rissman wrote the above \r\n  language into the contract to insure it was perspicuous to all involved that \r\n  no representations were relied upon by either party.\r\nThe language used in the case sub judice neither includes \r\n  the words â€œrelyâ€ or â€œreliance,â€ nor does it set forth any statement that the \r\n  parties did not, or could not, rely on the representations of the other party.Â  \r\n  The clause merely provides that the prior â€œrepresentations, promises, agreements \r\n  or understandings, written or oral, not contained herein shall be of no force \r\n  or effectâ€ within the contract, thereby accomplishing the same purpose as a \r\n  merger clause.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 989 (6th ed. 1990) \r\n  (defining a merger clause as â€œ[a] provision in a contract to the effect that \r\n  the written terms may not be varied by prior or oral agreements because all \r\n  such agreements have been merged into the written document.â€).Â  We conclude \r\n  the provision is not a non-reliance clause, but is merely a portion of the merger \r\n  clause.\r\nB.Â  Parol Evidence Rule/Merger Clause\r\nWe now turn to South Carolina law to determine whether the parol evidence rule \r\n  or the merger clause bars the admission of extrinsic evidence regarding fraud \r\n  and negligent misrepresentation.Â  We find extrinsic evidence is not barred by \r\n  the parol evidence rule or the merger clause.\r\nThe parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of \r\n  agreements or understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a \r\n  written instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, \r\n  vary, or explain the written instrument.Â  See Estate of Holden v. \r\n  Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 539 S.E.2d 703 (2000); Crafton v. Brown, 346 \r\n  S.C. 347, 550 S.E.2d 904 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIt is axiomatic that there exists a well established exception to \r\n  the parol evidence rule which allows extrinsic evidence by the party attacking \r\n  an instrument on the ground of fraud.Â  Bradley v. Hullander, 272 S.C. \r\n  6, 249 S.E.2d 486 (1978); Allen-Parker Co. v. Lollis, 257 S.C. 266, 185 \r\n  S.E.2d 739 (1971); see also Restatement (Second) of Agency Â§ 257 cmt. \r\n  c (1958) (â€œAlthough parol evidence cannot be introduced to vary or contradict \r\n  the terms of a written contract, it can be introduced for the purpose of proving \r\n  that the contract was obtained by means of untrue statements.â€); Pinken v. \r\n  Frank, 704 F.2d 1019, 1023 (8th Cir. 1983) (finding â€œthe fraudulent inducement \r\n  exception to the parol evidence rule is not rendered inapplicable by a contract \r\n  merger provision that all agreements between the parties are contained therein \r\n  or a provision that no verbal agreement affecting the validity of the written \r\n  contract will be recognized.â€).\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court examined whether the parol evidence \r\n  rule is applicable to a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation in Gilliland \r\n  v. Elmwood Properties, 301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990):\r\n\r\nGilliland argues that either the parol evidence rule or \r\n  the merger clause in the partiesâ€™ contract precludes Elmwoodâ€™s negligent misrepresentation \r\n  claim.Â  We do not agree.Â  We have previously held that parol evidence is generally \r\n  admissible to show fraud in the inducement of a writing.Â  See Bradley \r\n  v. Hullander, 272 S.C. 6, 249 S.E.2d 486 (1978), appeal after remand, \r\n  277 S.C. 327, 287 S.E.2d 140 (1982).Â  In Bradley we did not decide whether \r\n  this is true for negligent misrepresentation as such was not alleged or proved \r\n  in that case.Â  The applicability of the parol evidence rule to a cause of action \r\n  for negligent misrepresentation is apparently a novel issue in this state.\r\n  â€œIn a majority of jurisdictions the parol evidence rule \r\n  bars oral testimony in certain contract cases, but is not applicable in misrepresentation \r\n  cases.â€Â  Rempel v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., 471 Pa. 404, 370 A.2d 366, \r\n  370 (1977).Â  The parol evidence rule has been held inapplicable to tort causes \r\n  of action (including negligent misrepresentation) since the rule is one of substantive \r\n  contract law.Â  Formento v. Encanto Business Park, 154 Ariz. 495, 744 \r\n  P.2d 22 (App. 1987).Â  Furthermore, it has been held that â€œa seller should not \r\n  be allowed to hide behind an integration clause to avoid the consequences of \r\n  a misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or negligent.â€Â  Id., 744 P.2d \r\n  at 26.Â Â  We follow the reasoning of the Formento court and hold that \r\n  neither the parol evidence rule nor the merger or integration clause in the \r\n  partiesâ€™ contract prevents Elmwood from proceeding on its negligent misrepresentation \r\n  theory.\r\n\r\nId. at 301-02, 391 S.E.2d at 580-81; see also Koontz v. Thomas, \r\n  333 S.C. 702, 511 S.E.2d 407 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting that in South Carolina, \r\n  as in the majority of jurisdictions, parol evidence rule bars oral testimony \r\n  in certain contract cases; however Supreme Court has held parol evidence rule \r\n  is not applicable in cases involving tort of negligent misrepresentation).\r\nWe find Edwards should not be allowed to hide behind the merger clause \r\n  in the withdrawal agreement.Â  â€œ[T]he parol evidence rule was designed to prevent \r\n  frauds, not to promote frauds by immunizing a party from claims arising out \r\n  of his fraudulent misrepresentations.â€Â  Pinken, 704 F.2d at 1023.Â  Accepting \r\n  as true the facts as presented by McDaniel, Edwards knew he was misrepresenting \r\n  the status of the Eddy Farm property.Â  He had already submitted an agreement \r\n  to purchase the property and was able to close on the property on October 7, \r\n  one day after signing the October 6 withdrawal agreement.Â  We find the trial \r\n  court erred in ruling the merger clause barred the admission of parol evidence \r\n  regarding the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.\r\nC.Â  Reliance as Question of Fact\r\nMcDanielâ€™s claims are based on fraud and negligent misrepresentation. \r\n  The elements of an action for fraud based on a representation include: (1) a \r\n  representation; (2) falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) knowledge of the falsity \r\n  or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation \r\n  be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance \r\n  upon the truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s \r\n  consequent and proximate injury.Â  First State Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps, \r\n  299 S.C. 441, 385 S.E.2d 821 (1989); Moorhead v. First Piedmont Bank &amp; \r\n  Trust Co., 273 S.C. 356, 256 S.E.2d 414 (1979).\r\nIn a claim for the tort of negligent misrepresentation where the damage alleged \r\n  is a pecuniary loss, the essential elements include: (1) the defendant made \r\n  a false representation to the plaintiff;Â  (2) the defendant had a pecuniary \r\n  interest in making the statement;Â  (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to \r\n  see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff;Â  (4) the defendant \r\n  breached that duty by failing to exercise due care;Â  (5) the plaintiff justifiably \r\n  relied on the representation;Â  and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss \r\n  as the proximate result of his reliance upon the representation.Â  Rickborn \r\n  v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468 S.E.2d 292 (1996); Koontz \r\n  v. Thomas, 333 S.C. 702, 511 S.E.2d 407 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe Supreme Court, in Gilliland v. Elmwood Props., 301 S.C. 295, 391 \r\n  S.E.2d 577 (1990), discussed the tort of negligent misrepresentation:\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, one may bring an action sounding in tort \r\n  for negligent misrepresentation.Â  â€œA duty to exercise reasonable care in giving \r\n  information exists when the defendant has a pecuniary interest in the transaction.â€Â  \r\n  Winburn v. Insurance Co., 287 S.C. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 142, 146 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985).Â  â€œThe recovery of damages may be predicated upon a negligently made \r\n  false statement where a party suffers either injury or loss as a consequence \r\n  of relying upon the misrepresentation.â€Â  Id.Â  These general rules have \r\n  been applied, in every case this Court has located, to support the recognition \r\n  of a negligent misrepresentation claim where the misrepresented fact(s) induced \r\n  the plaintiff to enter a contract or business transaction.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Winburn, supra (recognizing that under appropriate facts, negligent \r\n  representations inducing the signing of an endorsement could be actionable); \r\n  Pittman v. Galloway, 281 S.C. 70, 313 S.E.2d 632 (Ct. App. 1984) (negligent \r\n  representation inducing the plaintiffâ€™s purchase of land is actionable); and \r\n  First Federal Sav. Bank v. Knauss, 296 S.C. 136, 370 S.E.2d 906 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1988) (recognizing that under appropriate facts, negligent representations \r\n  inducing property purchase could be actionable).\r\n\r\nId. at 301, 391 S.E.2d at 580. \r\nEdwards contends McDaniel had no right to rely, nor could he have \r\n  justifiably relied, on the representation regarding the Eddy Farm tract because \r\n  McDaniel agreed in the withdrawal agreement not to rely.Â  Even if the clause \r\n  in the withdrawal agreement is considered a non-reliance clause, then the precedent \r\n  in South Carolina is to look to the totality of circumstances to determine whether \r\n  reliance was justified.Â  See West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œWhether reliance is justified in a given situation \r\n  requires an evaluation of the circumstances involved, including the positions \r\n  and relations of the parties.â€Â  Elders v. Parker, 286 S.C. 228, 233, \r\n  332 S.E.2d 563, 567 (Ct. App. 1985); see also Parks v. Morris Homes \r\n  Corp., 245 S.C. 461, 467, 141 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1965) (â€œWhat constitutes \r\n  reasonable prudence and diligence with respect to reliance upon a representation \r\n  in a particular case and the degree of fault attributable to such reliance will \r\n  depend upon the various circumstances involved, such as the form and materiality \r\n  of the representation, the respective intelligence, experience, age, and mental \r\n  and physical condition of the parties, the relation and respective knowledge \r\n  and means of knowledge of the parties, etc.â€).Â  â€œThe general rule is that questions \r\n  concerning reliance and its reasonableness are factual questions for the jury.â€Â  \r\n  Unlimited Servs., Inc. v. Macklen Enters., Inc., 303 S.C. 384, 387, 401 \r\n  S.E.2d 153, 155 (1991); see also Starkey v. Bell, 281 S.C. 308, \r\n  313, 315 S.E.2d 153, 156 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œIssues of reliance and its reasonableness, \r\n  going as they do to subjective states of mind and applications of objective \r\n  standards of reasonableness, are preeminently factual issues for the triers \r\n  of the facts.â€).\r\nHere, the circumstances involved a person who had a fiduciary duty to disclose \r\n  all relevant facts and refrain from taking advantage of the other partners by \r\n  the slightest misrepresentation or concealment.Â  See Lawson v. Rogers, \r\n  312 S.C. 492, 435 S.E.2d 853 (1993); Few v. Few, 239 S.C. 321, 122 S.E.2d \r\n  829 (1961).\r\nMcDaniel claims Edwards violated his duties as \r\n  a partner.Â  McDaniel argues that, as a partner, Edwards owed McDaniel the highest \r\n  degree of good faith in his dealings with reference to any matter concerning \r\n  the business.\r\nPartners are fiduciaries each to the other and \r\n  their relationship is one of mutual trust and confidence, imposing upon them \r\n  requirements of loyalty, good faith and fair dealing.Â  Few, 239 S.C. \r\n  at 336, 122 S.E.2d at 836; see also Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., \r\n  342 S.C. 579, 538 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that one of the paramount \r\n  duties of partners among themselves, if not the primary duty, is their fiduciary \r\n  duty, universally recognized as including a duty to exercise good faith and \r\n  maintain the highest integrity in dealing with other partners).\r\nThe duty owed by partners to each other is further detailed in S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 33-41-540(1) (1990):\r\n\r\nEvery partner must account to the partnership for any benefit and hold as trustee \r\n  for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners \r\n  from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of \r\n  the partnership or from any use by him of its property.\r\n\r\nâ€œA â€˜fiduciary relationshipâ€™ is founded on trust and confidence reposed \r\n  by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.â€Â  Steele v. Victory \r\n  Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, 293, 368 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  It exists \r\n  when one imposes a special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity \r\n  and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the \r\n  interests of the one imposing the confidence.Â  Id.; see also Landvest \r\n  Assocs. v. Owens, 276 S.C. 22, 274 S.E.2d 433 (1981) (observing that partners \r\n  were fiduciaries to each other).Â  The fiduciary relationship of partners is \r\n  discussed in 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 420 (1987):\r\n\r\nThe courts universally recognize the fiduciary relationship \r\n  of partners and impose on them obligations of the utmost good faith and integrity \r\n  in their dealings with one another in partnership affairs.Â  It is a fundamental \r\n  characteristic of partnership that the partnersâ€™ relationship is one of trust \r\n  and confidence when dealing with each other in partnership matters.\r\nPartners are held to a standard stricter than the morals \r\n  of the marketplace, and their fiduciary duties should be broadly construed, \r\n  connoting not mere honesty but the punctilio of honor most sensitive.Â  In all \r\n  matters connected with the partnership every partner is bound to act in a manner \r\n  not to obtain any advantage over his copartner in the partnership affairs by \r\n  the slightest misrepresentation, concealment, threat, or adverse pressure of \r\n  any kind.Â  A partner cannot act too quickly to protect his own financial position \r\n  at the expense of his partners, even in the absence of malice.\r\n\r\n59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 420 (1987) (footnotes omitted).\r\nSouth Carolina case law recognizes the fiduciary duty owed between partners:\r\n\r\nThe law holds each member of a partnership to the highest degree of good \r\n  faith in his dealings with reference to any matter which concerns the business \r\n  of the common engagement, and each partner, being the agent of the firm, must \r\n  be held to the same accountability as other trustees, in all matters which affect \r\n  the common interest.Â  The relationship of a partnership is fiduciary in character \r\n  and imposes on the members the obligation of refraining from taking any advantage \r\n  of one another by the slightest misrepresentation or concealment.\r\n\r\nLawson, 312 S.C. at 498-99, 435 S.E.2d at 857 (emphasis added) (citations \r\n  omitted); see also Edwards v. Johnson, 90 S.C. 90, 72 S.E. 638 \r\n  (1911) (stating that each member of a partnership is held to the highest degree \r\n  of good faith in his dealings with reference to any matter concerning the business \r\n  of the common engagement, and each partner, being an agent of the firm, must \r\n  be held, during the existence of the relation, to the same accountability as \r\n  other trustees in all matters affecting the common interest).Â  \r\nApodictically, Edwards was in a fiduciary relationship with McDaniel and owed \r\n  McDaniel the highest loyalty.Â  The nature of the partnership relationship imposed \r\n  a fiduciary duty upon Edwards to refrain from taking any advantage of McDaniel \r\n  by even the slightest misrepresentation or concealment.Â  Such a relationship \r\n  imposes â€œthe duty of the finest loyalty[,] . . . [n]ot honesty alone, but the \r\n  punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.â€Â  Kuznik, 342 S.C. at 597, \r\n  538 S.E.2d at 24 (quoting Meinhard v. Salmon, 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928)).Â  \r\n  Edwards cannot act to protect his own financial interests at the expense of \r\n  the interests of the other partners and the Partnership.Â  See 59A Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 420.\r\nWhen asked why the provision was struck through, McDaniel responded:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nBecause when I brought this up, Mr. Edwards told me that we had lost the Eddy \r\n  tract, the lawyers from the estate got it and we could no longer get it.Â  I \r\n  go, shoot, if itâ€™s gone, itâ€™s gone.Â  I thought thatâ€™s the way we were doing \r\n  it.Â  And I scratched through it.\r\n\r\nMcDaniel was then asked: â€œWhy not put it in there just in case that particular \r\n  deal that you claim Mr. Edwards told you about fell through?â€Â  He answered:Â  \r\n  â€œHindsight is 40/40.Â  I had no reason to doubt my partner.Â  He told me.Â  \r\n  I did it.Â  And thatâ€™s the way it is.Â  I have no reasons to â€“ any other motive.â€Â  \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nIn the instant case, the misrepresentation was allegedly made for \r\n  the distinct purpose of taking a partnership opportunity for Edwardsâ€™ own financial \r\n  benefit.Â  The representation was made in response to the inclusion of the Eddy \r\n  Farm tract in the August 5 handwritten withdrawal agreement as a property on \r\n  which Edwards could not compete with the Partnership.Â  McDaniel averred that \r\n  if Edwards had not represented that the Eddy Farm was â€œlost,â€ the property would \r\n  have remained in the agreement as a Partnership opportunity.Â  It was a question \r\n  for the jury to determine whether McDaniel had the right to rely on Edwardsâ€™ \r\n  representation after considering the relationship of the parties, the nature \r\n  and materiality of the representation, and the clause in the contract.Â  See \r\n  Epstein v. Howell, 308 S.C. 528, 419 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court erred in concluding the October 6, 1998 withdrawal \r\n  agreement contained a non-reliance clause.Â  We rule the October 6 agreement \r\n  is subject to parol evidence on the issues of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\n  South Carolina precedent allows parol evidence to show fraud.Â  The parol evidence \r\n  rule is not applicable to a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the court erred in finding the merger clause barred the admission \r\n  of parol evidence to show the agreement was entered into only after Edwardsâ€™ \r\n  allegedly fraudulent representations and/or negligent misrepresentation.Â  Finally, \r\n  we conclude that because the clause is not a non-reliance clause, \r\n  the question of whether McDanielâ€™s reliance was reasonable was a question of \r\n  fact for the jury after consideration of the totality of the circumstances.Â  \r\n  The trial court erred in granting summary judgment, as there were genuine issues \r\n  of material fact remaining.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\n\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n HUFF, J., and MOREHEAD, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Wendswept is a company solely owned by McDanielâ€™s wife.Â  Wendswept owned property \r\n    for development prior to the formation of Redwend.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    According to J. Drayton Hastie, the Partnershipâ€™s attorney, Edwards used Patrick \r\n    as the agent for the Partnership to acquire property so people would not know \r\n    the property was being sold to a developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3630","title":"State v.

Coombs, of Columbia; Solicitor William Townes Jones, of Greenwood; \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n HEARN, C.J.:Â  Danny Ray Tutton was indicted for second-degree \r\n  criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor, and two counts of lewd act on a \r\n  minor.Â  A jury found him guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to twenty years \r\n  confinement on the CSC charge, a consecutive term of fifteen years for the first \r\n  lewd act, and an additional consecutive term of fifteen years for the second \r\n  lewd act, which was suspended upon the service of five years probation.Â  Tutton \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial judge erred by admitting evidence of uncharged criminal \r\n  conduct under the common scheme or plan exception to State v. Lyle, 125 \r\n  S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), and Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\nI. \r\n  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn July of 2000, Tuttonâ€™s live-in girlfriend, Tammy, invited thirteen-year \r\n  old Mary and her younger sisters, Jane[1]\r\n  and Tanya,[2]   to Tuttonâ€™s \r\n  home for several days to play with Tammyâ€™s daughter, Sarah. Â During the \r\n  stay, the girls, Tammy, and Tutton spent the days picnicking, washing Tuttonâ€™s \r\n  truck, and swimming in the river and in Tuttonâ€™s pool.Â  The charges facing Tutton \r\n  arose out of the following contested facts.Â  \r\nThe first \r\n  night, all four girls slept on the floor by Tuttonâ€™s bed.Â  Jane testified that \r\n  while she was sleeping, Tutton began rubbing her â€œbutt.â€Â  She alleged \r\n  that after she rolled over, Tutton was able to reach under the covers and put \r\n  his hands inside her shorts to rub her private parts.Â  Jane further stated â€œHe \r\n  stuck his fingers inside of me.â€Â  After Tutton fell asleep, Jane left the room. \r\n  \r\nOn the second night, Tutton was sleeping on the couch while the girls \r\n  were sleeping on a pallet of blankets placed on the floor nearby.Â  Mary testified \r\n  that while Tutton was lying on the couch, he began to touch her â€œbuttâ€ outside \r\n  the covers.Â  When she turned over, he touched her â€œprivate part.â€Â Â  Mary stated \r\n  she kept the blankets tightly around her, and therefore, Tutton was unable to \r\n  reach underneath them. Â After Mary pinched her sister to move over, she \r\n  moved out of Tuttonâ€™s reach and the touching stopped.Â  \r\nThe allegations surfaced after the girlsâ€™ father, Chris, became suspicious \r\n  that something might have happened during their stay at Tuttonâ€™s home.Â  He became \r\n  concerned because the girls were acting quiet and withdrawn upon returning home \r\n  and did not kiss him goodnight as they always had done.Â  Chris testified that \r\n  the next day, he asked the girls if â€œanybody bothered [them] or did anything \r\n  they shouldnâ€™t have?â€Â  The girls both indicated that Tutton had â€œput his handsâ€ \r\n  on them.Â  Thereafter, the authorities were notified.\r\nBecause of the alleged penetration, Jane saw a pediatrician trained \r\n  in sexual abuse cases.Â  The doctor performed a genital examination with the \r\n  aid of a colposcope.Â  The exam revealed no evidence of trauma.Â  However, the \r\n  doctor testified that while the results of the exam could not prove penetration \r\n  had occurred, it was possible that digital penetration could have occurred without \r\n  Janeâ€™s hymen showing any evidence of trauma. \r\nThe issue in this case arose during Janeâ€™s testimony before the court.Â  \r\n  During its direct examination, the State sought to elicit testimony that Tutton \r\n  had sexually assaulted Jane on another occasion several years prior to the events \r\n  in question.Â  Counsel for Tutton objected, arguing the testimony amounted to \r\n  inadmissible character evidence.Â  Outside the presence of the jury, the State \r\n  proffered Janeâ€™s testimony as to the prior occurrence.Â  \r\nJane testified that four or five years prior to the time of trial, \r\n  Tutton sexually assaulted her.Â  The assault allegedly occurred when she and \r\n  Mary were staying with Tutton and Tammy while their parents were on vacation.Â  \r\n  Jane testified that Tutton forced her to lie on her back and take off her panties.Â  \r\n  She stated Tutton then performed oral sex on her and forced her to perform oral \r\n  sex on him.Â  She alleged that Tutton threatened to tell her parents she was \r\n  misbehaving if she spoke of the incident.Â  Jane never told anyone about this \r\n  incident prior to the investigation into the current charges facing Tutton. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court ruled this evidence was admissible under the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception to Lyle.Â  Specifically, the trial court found \r\n  that Janeâ€™s testimony regarding the past misconduct was clear and convincing, \r\n  and that the prior acts bore a close similarity to the crimes charged; thus \r\n  the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.Â  \r\n  The testimony was thereafter presented to the jurors, who ultimately convicted \r\n  Tutton.Â  \r\nII.Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEvidence of prior crimes or misconduct is inadmissible to prove the \r\n  specific crime charged unless the evidence tends to establish (1) motive; (2) \r\n  intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan \r\n  embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that \r\n  proof of one tends to establish the proof of the other; or (5) the identity \r\n  of the person charged with the present crime.Â  See Lyle, 125 S.C. \r\n  at 416, 118 S.E. at 807; Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  To be admissible, a prior bad act \r\n  must first be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  State v. Beck, \r\n  342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, \r\n  468, 523 S.E.2d 787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating if a prior bad act is not \r\n  the subject of a conviction, proof thereof must be by clear and convincing evidence).Â  \r\n  \r\nIf the \r\n  trial judge finds there is clear and convincing evidence that the defendant \r\n  committed the uncharged acts, it must next be determined whether the prior acts \r\n  fall within the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle.Â  â€œA close degree \r\n  of similarity or connection between the prior bad act and the crime for which \r\n  the defendant is on trial is required to support admissibility under the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception.â€ State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 546, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001).Â  The connection must be more than just a general similarity.Â  \r\n  State v. Timmons, 327 S.C. 48, 52, 488 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1997).Â  â€œA common \r\n  scheme or plan involves more than the commission of two similar crimes; some \r\n  connection between the two is necessary.â€Â  Id.Â  Where the evidence of \r\n  the bad acts is so similar to the charged offense that the previous act enhances \r\n  the probative value of the evidence so as to outweigh its prejudicial effect, \r\n  it is admissible.Â  Weaverling, 337 S.C. at 468, 523 S.E.2d at 791.Â  However, \r\n  even if the evidence is clear and convincing and falls within a Lyle \r\n  exception, the trial judge must exclude it if its probative value is substantially \r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id.\r\nA.Â  Clear and Convincing Evidence\r\nWhen \r\n  considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence of other bad acts, \r\n  this court is bound by the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly \r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) \r\n  (finding the appellate court committed error by basing its ruling on its own \r\n  view of the witnessâ€™s credibility).Â  In this case, there is evidence in the \r\n  record in the form of Janeâ€™s proffered testimony that the prior assault occurred.Â  \r\n  The determination of a witnessâ€™s credibility must be left to the trial judge \r\n  who saw and heard the witness and is therefore in a better position to evaluate \r\n  his or her veracity.Â  State v. Rosier, 312 S.C. 145, 149, 439 S.E.2d \r\n  307, 310 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Accordingly, the determination as to whether Janeâ€™s \r\n  testimony clearly and convincingly established that the prior assault occurred \r\n  is a matter well within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  We find no abuse of that \r\n  discretion in light of Janeâ€™s proffered testimony.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. \r\n  at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829. \r\nB.Â  \r\n  Common Scheme or Plan Exception\r\nHaving found that the record supports the trial judgeâ€™s ruling that \r\n  Tutton committed the prior bad act, we must next determine whether the evidence \r\n  falls within the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle.Â  Initially, \r\n  we note that no South Carolina cases expressly state the standard of review \r\n  for determining whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to establish \r\n  the existence of a common scheme or plan.Â  Ordinarily, questions concerning \r\n  the admissibility of evidence are treated as questions of fact.Â  Wilson, \r\n  345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  However, there are several cases in which \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s admission of evidence under the common scheme or plan exception \r\n  was reversed after the appellate courts in South Carolina found that the similarities \r\n  between the charged and uncharged acts were insufficient to establish the existence \r\n  of such a plan or design.Â  See State v. Timmons, 327 S.C. 48, \r\n  53, 488 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1997) (â€œReviewing this list of similarities, we disagree \r\n  with the trial judge.Â  The only point of similarity with any merit is the alleged \r\n  similar clothing worn by the robbers.â€);Â  State v. Berry, 332 S.C. 214, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1998) (cert. denied, June 24, 1999)Â  (reversing \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s admission of the evidence under the common scheme or plan \r\n  exception after finding insufficient similarities between the separate attacks); \r\n  State v. Davenport, 321 S.C. 134, 467 S.E.2d 258 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œWe \r\n  cannot clearly perceive the connection between the [separate] acts based on \r\n  these criteria, and we therefore conclude [the witnessâ€™s] testimony should have \r\n  been excluded.â€).Â  Certainly, the factual determination as to whether the prior \r\n  assault occurred in this case is left to the discretion of the trial judge.Â  \r\n  However, in light of these authorities, we believe the determination of whether \r\n  the facts surrounding that assault sufficiently evidence a common scheme or \r\n  plan is a question of law.Â  In Lyle, our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\nWhether evidence \r\n  of other distinct crimes properly falls within any of the recognized exceptions \r\n  noted is often a difficult matter to determine.Â  The acid test is its logical \r\n  relevancy to the particular excepted purpose or purposes for which it is sought \r\n  to be introduced. . . . Whether the requisite degree of relevancy exists is \r\n  a judicial question to be resolved in the light of the consideration that the \r\n  inevitable tendency of such evidence is to raise a legally spurious presumption \r\n  of guilt in the minds of the jurors.Â  Hence, if the court does not clearly perceive \r\n  the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the crime charged, \r\n  that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be given the benefit of the \r\n  doubt and the evidence should be rejected.\r\n\r\nLyle, 125 \r\n  S.C. at 416-17, 118 S.E. at 807.\r\nThe trial \r\n  judge ruled the prior sexual assault on Jane was sufficiently similar to the \r\n  charged crimes to justify admitting evidence of the prior assault under the \r\n  common scheme or plan exception.Â  We hold this was error.Â  \r\n1.Â  \r\n  Common scheme or plan in sex crime cases\r\nWhen \r\n  he ruled on the admissibility of the uncharged conduct, the trial judge expressly \r\n  relied on the reasoning in State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 323 S.E.2d \r\n  772 (1984), and State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  These cases support the contention that the common scheme or plan \r\n  exception to Lyle is often satisfied in criminal sexual conduct cases \r\n  because the evidence tends to prove the defendants engaged in patterns of continuous \r\n  illicit conduct.Â  \r\nIn Weaverling, \r\n  the court stated, â€œ[t]he common scheme or plan exception â€˜is generally applied \r\n  in cases involving sexual crimes, where evidence of acts prior and subsequent \r\n  to the act charged in the indictment is held admissible as tending to show continued \r\n  illicit intercourse between the same parties.â€™â€Â  337 S.C. at 469, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  at 791 (quoting State v. Whitener, 28 S.C. 244, 265, 89 S.E.2d 701, 711 \r\n  (1955)) (emphasis added).Â  In Weaverling, the defendant allegedly performed \r\n  fellatio on the same victim almost every time the two were together for a period \r\n  of five or six years.Â  The victim testified that he had been assaulted by the \r\n  defendant in excess of one hundred times.Â  This court found the defendantâ€™s \r\n  pattern of continuous sexual abuse satisfied the common scheme or plan exception.Â  \r\n  Id. at 469, 523 S.E.2d at 791.Â  \r\nLikewise, \r\n  in McClellan, the defendant repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct with \r\n  each of his three daughters.Â  All of the assaults began around the girlsâ€™ twelfth \r\n  birthdays, the defendant always quoted Bible verses to the girls, and he always \r\n  gave the same excuses for his actions.Â  The trial judge found the evidence in \r\n  the case established a pattern of continuous illicit conduct, and admitted the \r\n  evidence under the common scheme or plan exception.Â  McClellan, 283 S.C. \r\n  at 392, 323 S.E.2d at 774.\r\nWe interpret \r\n  these cases to suggest that common scheme or plan evidence in criminal sexual \r\n  conduct cases will be admitted on a generalized basis only where there is a \r\n  pattern of continuous illicit conduct.Â  Sex crimes may be unique in this respect \r\n  because they commonly involve the same victims engaged in repeated incidents \r\n  occurring under very similar circumstances.Â  The reason for the general admissibility \r\n  of such evidence under these circumstances is self evident â€“ where there is \r\n  a pattern of continuous conduct shown, that pattern clearly supports the inference \r\n  of the existence of a common scheme or plan, thus bolstering the probability \r\n  that the charged act occurred in a similar fashion.Â  \r\nHowever, \r\n  Weaverling and McClellan do not lower the bar for admissibility \r\n  under Lyle simply because sexual crimes are involved.Â  Regardless of \r\n  the nature of the charges facing the defendant, there must be evidence that \r\n  the defendant employed a common scheme or plan in the commission of the crimes.Â  \r\n  Where there is a pattern of continuous misconduct, as commonly found in sex \r\n  crimes, that pattern supplies the necessary connection to support the existence \r\n  of a plan.Â  Presumably, this is so because the same evidence that establishes \r\n  the continuous nature of the assaults will generally suffice to prove the existence \r\n  of the common scheme or plan as well.Â  In Weaverling and McClellan, \r\n  the sheer volume of repeated occurrences, together with the close similarities \r\n  in the assaults, evidenced a pattern of continuous illicit conduct.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  these cases fall squarely within the plain meaning of common scheme or plan \r\n  evidence.Â  McClellan, 283 S.C. at 392, 323 S.E.2d at 774 (stating it \r\n  would be difficult to conceive of evidence more within the common scheme or \r\n  plan exception);Â  Weaverling, 337 at 469, 523 S.E.2d at 791 (stating \r\n  the pattern of sexual abuse represented â€œquintessential common scheme or plan \r\n  evidenceâ€).Â  \r\nWeaverling \r\n  and McClellan involved longstanding histories of continuous abuse between \r\n  the same parties.Â  However, such is not necessary to find common scheme or plan \r\n  evidence.Â  For example, in Whitener, the defendant had nonconsensual \r\n  intercourse with the victim at a hotel room, left the scene with the victim, \r\n  and returned with the victim shortly thereafter to perform oral sex on her in \r\n  the same room.Â  In the Stateâ€™s prosecution for rape, the court allowed testimony \r\n  regarding the subsequent oral sex act on the basis that this uncharged act was \r\n  part of the same â€œcontinued illicit intercourse between the same parties.â€Â  \r\n  Whitener, 228 S.C. at 265, 89 S.E.2d at 711.Â  The continuous nature of \r\n  the illicit conduct in Whitener is established by the fact that the separate \r\n  assaults occurred during the same series of continuous events on the day in \r\n  question.Â  The court found the evidence tended to â€œestablish a common scheme \r\n  or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other \r\n  that proof of one tend[ed] to establish the other[].â€Â  Id. (finding that \r\n  the oral sex act performed shortly after the rape was relevant to the proof \r\n  of the rape charge because it tended to explain the absence of spermatozoa on \r\n  the victim).\r\nHowever, \r\n  the suggestion that common scheme or plan evidence will generally be admitted \r\n  in cases involving patterns of continuous misconduct is misleading.Â  The court \r\n  must still clearly perceive the same logical relevance of the extraneous acts \r\n  to the charged offense.Â  Where the evidence discloses a pattern of continuous \r\n  illicit conduct, as in Weaverling, for example, the logical relevance \r\n  is apparent and the evidence will generally be admitted.Â  In Whitener, \r\n  the uncharged act was logically relevant to the charged offense because both \r\n  acts arose from a single, continuous series of events, and proof of one act \r\n  tended to establish that the other had occurred.Â  \r\nHere, \r\n  we are compelled to find there is no pattern of continuous illicit conduct similar \r\n  to that found in Weaverling and McClellan.Â  Therefore, we believe \r\n  the trial judge erred to the extent he based his ruling on the reasoning of \r\n  these cases.Â  Furthermore, Whitener does not reconcile the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  reasoning because there is no continuous series of events tying the uncharged \r\n  act to the charged offenses in the present case.Â  To the extent we find there \r\n  is no continuous illicit conduct in this case, we do so only to distinguish \r\n  the present case from the authorities relied on by the trial judge.Â  It goes \r\n  without saying that the conduct need not be continuous to fall within the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception.Â  In this case, there is no continuous conduct, but \r\n  that fact, standing alone, does not preclude the existence of a scheme or plan.Â  \r\n  Instead, the determination of the admissibility of the uncharged act rests solely \r\n  on whether the requisite degree of similarity between the separate acts is present \r\n  in this case.Â  Lyle, 125 S.C. at 416-17, 118 S.E. at 807; see also \r\n  State v. Rogers, 293 S.C. 505, 362 S.E.2d 7 (1987) (revâ€™d on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993)) (refusing \r\n  to allow testimony regarding uncharged sexual intercourse under the common scheme \r\n  or plan exception where the charged assault involved only â€œtouchingâ€). \r\n2.Â  \r\n  The logical relevance of Tuttonâ€™s uncharged acts\r\nIn this \r\n  case, as with many criminal sexual conduct cases, the question before the jury \r\n  is not whether the State has charged the correct person with the crime; instead, \r\n  the question is whether the charged crime actually occurred.Â  The purpose of \r\n  admitting evidence of other instances of sexual misconduct under the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception is to bolster the probability that the charged acts \r\n  occurred.Â  See 2 Wigmore on Evidence Â§ 304 (Chadborne rev. ed. 1979) \r\n  (stating that where the evidence is introduced to prove the existence of a plan, \r\n  the purpose â€œis to show (by probability) a precedent design which in turn is \r\n  to evidence (by probability) the doing of the act designed.â€).Â  Here, if the \r\n  evidence suggests Tuttonâ€™s prior abuse of Jane was part of an overall plan or \r\n  scheme devised by him to perpetuate the type of misconduct that occurred, it \r\n  is relevant to prove the charged assaults on Jane and Mary occurred.Â  Id.\r\nWhere \r\n  such a plan exists, the charged and uncharged acts represent individual achievements \r\n  of the purposes for which the plan was established. See 2 Wigmore, Â§ \r\n  304 (stating that where separate offenses are sufficiently similar, there is \r\n  an inference that they are manifestations of a common scheme or plan).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the evidence in such cases speaks to the existence of the defendantâ€™s plan, \r\n  not to the defendantâ€™s character.Â  This is so because the jury is not asked \r\n  to draw an inference that the prior bad acts would evince the defendantâ€™s propensity \r\n  to commit the charged offenses; instead, the jury is asked to infer that the \r\n  defendant developed a criminal scheme and employed that scheme as probative \r\n  evidence that the charged acts occurred.Â  People v. Sabin, 614 N.W.2d \r\n  888, 900, n. 10 (Mich. 2000).Â  â€œThe logical relevance of the evidence is based \r\n  on the system, as shown through the similarities between the charged and uncharged \r\n  acts, rather than on [the] defendantâ€™s character, as shown by the uncharged \r\n  act.â€Â  Id.\r\nFor purposes \r\n  of analyzing evidence of prior misconduct under the common scheme or plan exception, \r\n  we believe it is crucial to distinguish similarities that merely link the two \r\n  crimes from those similarities that tend to paint the broader, more relevant \r\n  picture.Â  Where, for example, the similarities are used to prove only the defendantâ€™s \r\n  intent, very little is required because the charged act in such cases is assumed \r\n  done.Â  2 Wigmore, Â§ 304.Â  However, â€œwhere the very act is the object of proof, \r\n  and is desired to be inferred from a plan or system, the combination of common \r\n  features that will suggest a common plan as their explanation involves so much \r\n  higher a grade of similarity as to constitute a substantially new and distinct \r\n  test.â€ Id. Â â€œThe added element, then, must be, not merely a similarity \r\n  in the results, but such a concurrence of common features that the various \r\n  acts are normally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they \r\n  are the individual manifestations.â€Â  Id. (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n  \r\nIn this \r\n  case, there are similarities between the charged offenses and the prior alleged \r\n  assault.Â  First and foremost, the incidents involve the same parties.Â  Also, \r\n  both the prior uncharged assault on Jane and the charged offenses took place \r\n  while she and her sisters were staying at Tuttonâ€™s residence. [3]  \r\nImportantly, \r\n  however, the separate offenses are dissimilar in several significant ways.Â  \r\n  First, the uncharged assault on Jane is dissimilar in that it was more egregious \r\n  than the assaults for which Tutton was charged. In Rogers, the victim \r\n  and her sister both testified that the defendant had â€œtouchedâ€ them.Â  In addition, \r\n  the sister testified that the accused had sexual intercourse with her.Â  Our \r\n  supreme court held the testimony regarding the alleged intercourse was inadmissible.Â  \r\n  The court stated, â€œEven if the common scheme exception would have permitted \r\n  the evidence of the prior touching, \r\n  [4]  the evidence of sexual intercourse would not have been within the scope \r\n  of the common scheme.Â  Its introduction was highly prejudicial.â€Â  Rogers, \r\n  293 S.C. at 507, 362 S.E.2d 8.Â  Likewise, we hold Janeâ€™s testimony regarding \r\n  the alleged incidents of oral sex is highly prejudicial in light of the nature \r\n  of the charged offenses.Â  See Weaverling, 337 S.C. at 468, 523 \r\n  S.E.2d at 791 (stating that even if the evidence falls within a Lyle \r\n  exception, it must be excluded it if its probative value is substantially outweighed \r\n  by its prejudicial effect).\r\nThe dissimilarities \r\n  also include the fact that after the uncharged incident, Tutton allegedly threatened \r\n  Jane that she would be in trouble if she told anyone.Â  Neither girl received \r\n  a similar warning after the charged assaults.Â  In addition, unlike in the present \r\n  case, Tutton apparently attempted no other assaults against the others at the \r\n  time of the uncharged act.Â  Moreover, there was a substantial period of time \r\n  between the prior uncharged assault and the charged offenses. \r\n  [5] Â  The girls stayed with Tutton on several occasions during this interim, \r\n  apparently without incident.\r\nWhen ruling on \r\n  the evidence, the trial judge expressed his initial concern about the substantial \r\n  gap in time between the incidents, but apparently put his concerns to rest in \r\n  light of his understanding that Tutton had moved away during the interim.Â  However, \r\n  the trial judge apparently based this ruling on incomplete facts â€“ it was more \r\n  than two years after the first incident occurred when Tutton moved away from \r\n  the neighborhood.Â  Significantly, the victims stayed with Tutton several times \r\n  during the period between the alleged assaults.Â  The fact that no other incidents \r\n  occurred during these interim visits weakens the Stateâ€™s contention that Tutton \r\n  acted pursuant to a plan of sexually assaulting the victims when they spent \r\n  the night at his house.Â  Certainly, it is not necessary that Tutton assaulted \r\n  the victims on every occasion to establish a common scheme or plan, but there \r\n  must be sufficient evidence connecting the overnight stays to the alleged assaults \r\n  to clearly indicate that a scheme or plan is in use.Â  \r\nThe balancing \r\n  of the similarities in cases concerning the admission of common scheme or plan \r\n  evidence is a difficult task.Â  While inferential leaps are at the heart of such \r\n  decisions, we are compelled to find that the similarities in this case are insufficient \r\n  to support the inference that Tutton employed a common scheme or plan to commit \r\n  the assaults alleged in this case.Â  As stated in Lyle, â€œif the court \r\n  does not clearly perceive the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction \r\n  and the crime charged, that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be \r\n  given the benefit of the doubt and the evidence should be rejected.â€ Lyle, \r\n  125 S.C. at 417, 118 S.E. at 807; see also State v. Henry, 313 \r\n  S.C. 106, 432 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 1993) (cert. dismissed as improvidently \r\n  granted) (stating the defendant must be given the benefit of the doubt regarding \r\n  the introduction of common scheme testimony where the admissibility was a close \r\n  question). [6] Â  Because we do not clearly perceive \r\n  the required connection, we hold the trial judge erred by admitting Janeâ€™s testimony \r\n  about the uncharged assault under the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle. \r\n  \r\nMoreover, we believe \r\n  the error in admitting this evidence was not harmless.Â  Whether the improper \r\n  introduction of evidence is harmless requires us to look at the other evidence \r\n  admitted at trial in order to determine whether the defendantâ€™s guilt is conclusively \r\n  established by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion could \r\n  be reached by the jury.Â  Berry, 332 S.C. at 220, 503 S.E.2d at 773.Â  \r\n  Here, the evidence at trial consisted entirely of the victimsâ€™ accusations against \r\n  the defendant.Â  The defendant vehemently denied the accusations and the medical \r\n  evidence was inconclusive.Â  Considering this contested evidence and the fact \r\n  that the prior uncharged assault on Jane was more egregious than the charged \r\n  offenses, we cannot say that without this testimony, the evidence before the \r\n  jury was so overwhelming that a guilty verdict was the only rational conclusion.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  at 221, 503 S.E.2d at 774.Â  Accordingly, we reverse Tuttonâ€™s conviction \r\n  and remand for a new trial.\r\n \r\n  REVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Jane is approximately one year younger than Mary.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The names of these three children have been changed in this opinion \r\n    to protect their identities.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  Regarding the charged offenses, there was detailed testimony as \r\n    to where the victims and Tutton were lying and as to how Tutton commenced \r\n    the assaults.Â  This evidence was completely lacking as to the prior uncharged \r\n    assault.Â  Accordingly, there is little to aid this court in finding that similar \r\n    tactics were employed by Tutton as to that incident. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â Â  We note the court also found insufficient similarities between \r\n    the charged and uncharged offenses.Â  Rogers, 293 S.C. at 507, 362 S.E.2d \r\n    at 8.Â  The only connection between the assaults, which were ten years apart, \r\n    is that the accused touched both of his daughters.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CONNOR, J.:Â  Michael \r\n  Dunbar was indicted for trafficking in cocaine 100 to 200 grams, trafficking \r\n  in cocaine 200 to 400 grams, and trafficking in crack cocaine 200 to 400 grams.Â  \r\n  A jury convicted Dunbar of all three charges. The trial court sentenced him \r\n  to concurrent twenty-five-year sentences for the trafficking in cocaine offenses, \r\n  and a consecutive fifteen-year sentence for trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  Dunbar \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence obtained \r\n  as a result of two allegedly impermissible searches.Â  We affirm in part and \r\n  reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nActing on information from a confidential \r\n  informant, investigators from the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department initiated \r\n  an undercover drug bust.Â  In Officer Rainwaterâ€™s presence, the informant contacted \r\n  Dunbar and another individual to set up a drug transaction.Â  The informant arranged \r\n  to purchase five ounces of cocaine.Â  The two men arrived in their car to meet \r\n  the informant and deliver the drugs at the pre-designated time and place.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nPolice officers approached the car upon \r\n  receiving the informantâ€™s signal that drugs were present in the vehicle.Â  The \r\n  driver of the vehicle, Jonathan Small, fled on foot.Â  The defendant, Dunbar, \r\n  remained seated in the vehicle until the officers asked him to step out. Â The \r\n  officers searched the car and found a paper bag containing approximately five \r\n  ounces of cocaine.Â  The officers also noticed a hotel room key on the key chain \r\n  left in the carâ€™s ignition.Â  Dunbar informed Rainwater that he and Small were \r\n  staying at the Ramada Inn in West Columbia.Â  \r\nRainwater sought a warrant to search the \r\n  hotel room.Â  The search of the room turned up $3,795.00 in cash, digital scales, \r\n  a 9-millimeter pistol, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine.\r\nPrior to trial, Dunbar moved to suppress \r\n  the evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless search of the car and the \r\n  search of the hotel room pursuant to the execution of the search warrant.Â  The \r\n  trial court denied Dunbarâ€™s motion to suppress the evidence.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â \r\nWarrantless \r\n  Search of Vehicle\r\nDunbar argues the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to suppress the cocaine found in the vehicle because it was obtained \r\n  as a result of an unreasonable warrantless search.\r\nGenerally, warrantless searches are per \r\n  se unreasonable unless an exception to the warrant requirement is present.Â  State v. Peters, 271 S.C. 498, 248 S.E.2d 475 (1978).Â  Recognized exceptions \r\n  to the warrant requirement include: (1) a search incident to a lawful arrest; \r\n  (2) â€œhot pursuitâ€; (3) stop and frisk; (4) automobile exceptions; (5) the â€œplain \r\n  viewâ€ doctrine; and (6) consent.Â  State v. Bailey, 276 S.C. 32, 274 S.E.2d \r\n  913 (1981).Â  Dunbar argues the warrantless search of the vehicle was not pursuant \r\n  to any of the possible exceptions.Â  \r\nAs noted, one possible exception to the \r\n  warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest.Â  Once probable \r\n  cause exists for an arrest,Â  â€œ[p]olice officers may make a search of an arresteeâ€™s \r\n  person and the area within his immediate control for weapons and destructible \r\n  evidence.â€Â  State v. Ferrell, 274 S.C. 401, 405, 266 S.E.2d 869, 871 \r\n  (1980).Â  Dunbarâ€™s motion to suppress the evidence stated his â€œarrest was made \r\n  absent probable cause.â€ Thus, we focus on whether probable cause existed to \r\n  arrest Dunbar.\r\nâ€œThe fundamental question in determining \r\n  whether an arrest is lawful is whether there was â€˜probable causeâ€™ to make the \r\n  arrest.â€Â  Wortman v. City of Spartanburg, 310 S.C. 1, 4, 425 S.E.2d 18, \r\n  20 (1992).Â  Probable cause for an arrest â€œgenerally exists â€˜where the facts \r\n  and circumstances within the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge are sufficient for \r\n  a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been or is being committed by \r\n  the person to be arrested.â€™â€Â  State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 552, 451 \r\n  S.E.2d 34, 37 (Ct. App. 1994) (quoting United States v. Miller, 925 F.2d \r\n  695, 698 (4th Cir. 1991)).Â  Stated otherwise, â€œ[a] police officer has probable \r\n  cause to arrest without a warrant where he, â€˜in good faith, believes that a \r\n  person is guilty of a felony, and his belief rests on such grounds as would \r\n  induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the circumstances, to believe \r\n  likewise . . . .â€™â€Â  State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 17, 260 S.E.2d 705, \r\n  706 (1979) (quoting State v. Swilling, 249 S.C. 541, 558, 155 S.E.2d \r\n  607, 617 (1967)). \r\nIn determining whether probable cause \r\n  exists, â€œall the evidence within the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge may be considered, \r\n  including the details observed while responding to information received.â€Â  Roper, \r\n  274 S.C. at 17, 260 S.E.2d at 706; see Moultrie, 316 S.C. at 552, \r\n  451 S.E.2d at 37 (â€œIn assessing whether an officer has probable cause, the totality \r\n  of the circumstances surrounding the information at the officerâ€™s disposal must \r\n  be considered.â€). \r\nHere, the confidential informant told \r\n  Officer Rainwater he had previously purchased cocaine from two men who traveled \r\n  to Columbia from Florida.Â  The informant told Rainwater that he had dealt with \r\n  the two men on several occasions when they had been in the Columbia area.Â  The \r\n  informant agreed to set up a â€œstingâ€ operation in which these persons would \r\n  deliver cocaine to him at a gas station.Â  Rainwater met with the informant and \r\n  listened as the informant telephoned his drug sources \r\n  [1]  and requested that they deliver the drugs to him.Â  The informant told \r\n  Rainwater the men would be driving a blue Cadillac with wire rims.Â  Acting on \r\n  this information, the police set up surveillance and waited for the men to arrive \r\n  at the gas station.Â  The officers observed a blue Cadillac with wire rims drive \r\n  into the gas station.Â  They watched as the informant approached the car and \r\n  sat down in the back seat.Â  The informant then immediately exited the vehicle.Â  \r\n  The informantâ€™s act of getting out of the car was the cue for the officers to \r\n  move in based on the presence of drugs in the car.Â  Based on these facts and \r\n  observations, Rainwater and the other surveilling officers then moved in to \r\n  arrest the carâ€™s occupants.Â  After removing Dunbar from the passenger seat, \r\n  Rainwater retrieved a bag of cocaine from the passenger-side floorboard.Â  \r\nThe informantâ€™s description of the vehicle \r\n  was corroborated when the informant approached the car immediately upon its \r\n  arrival at the gas station.Â  Moreover, Rainwater listened while the informant \r\n  called to arrange the drug transaction.Â  When viewed under the totality of the \r\n  circumstances, the information provided by the informant, together with Rainwaterâ€™s \r\n  observations and verification of the information, was sufficient to give rise \r\n  to probable cause that the occupants of the car were conducting a drug transaction, \r\n  and that drugs could be found in the car.Â  See Moultrie, 316 S.C. \r\n  at 552, 451 S.E.2d at 37-38 (recognizing the validity of warrantless arrests \r\n  based on an informantâ€™s tip where arresting officers conduct no independent \r\n  investigation and corroboration consists of nothing more than observing predictions \r\n  supplied by the tip); cf. Roper, 274 S.C. at 16-19, 260 S.E.2d \r\n  at 706-707 (finding probable cause existed to stop an automobile matching a \r\n  witnessâ€™s description of two black males driving a late model, green Thunderbird \r\n  with a red and white license tag bearing the letters â€œMVBâ€ or â€œMVFâ€); Peters, \r\n  271 S.C. at 504, 248 S.E.2d at 478 (finding an informantâ€™s tip that a yellow \r\n  Grand Prix with a white top and South Carolina tags bearing the digits â€œ308â€ \r\n  would be leaving Folly Beach shortly and transporting marijuana was sufficient \r\n  to constitute probable cause to stop the vehicle).Â  \r\nTherefore, the warrantless arrest of Dunbar, \r\n  as well as the search incident to Dunbarâ€™s arrest, was proper.Â  The trial court \r\n  did not err in refusing to suppress the cocaine found inside the car.Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Validity of \r\n  Search Warrant\r\nDunbar argues the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search of the hotel \r\n  room.Â  Dunbar contends the affidavit is deficient and cannot form the basis \r\n  for a search warrant because the affiant admittedly had no direct knowledge \r\n  of numerous facts recited in the affidavit. \r\nAfter retrieving the cocaine from the \r\n  vehicle, Officer Rainwater noticed a hotel room key on the key chain left in \r\n  the carâ€™s ignition.Â  The key was inscribed with a room number.Â  Based on the \r\n  confidential informantâ€™s previous dealings with Dunbar, he knew Dunbar stayed \r\n  at a hotel while in Columbia.Â  The informant had alerted Rainwater to this fact \r\n  and told Rainwater to look for a hotel key.Â  Upon being asked, Dunbar informed \r\n  Rainwater that he and Small were staying at the Ramada Inn in West Columbia. \r\n\r\nBased on the seizure of the cocaine and the information \r\n  concerning the hotel room, Rainwater sought a warrant to search the room. Rainwater \r\n  telephoned the magistrate and discussed the probable cause to issue the search \r\n  warrant.Â  Rainwater did not, however, proceed to the magistrateâ€™s office to \r\n  obtain the warrant, but instead sent Officer Oâ€™Quinn. \r\nWhen Oâ€™Quinn arrived at the magistrateâ€™s office \r\n  the magistrate was on the telephone with Rainwater.Â  Oâ€™Quinn testified the magistrate \r\n  drafted the affidavit based on information received over the telephone from \r\n  Rainwater. [2] Â  Oâ€™Quinn stated \r\n  he â€œmerely signedâ€ the affidavit after reviewing it and did not offer any information \r\n  to the magistrate involving the probable cause for the search.Â  Oâ€™Quinn admitted \r\n  he had no â€œpersonal knowledgeâ€ of the facts contained in the affidavit other \r\n  than an awareness that five ounces of cocaine had been delivered to undercover \r\n  agents.Â  Oâ€™Quinn was stationed in a marked patrol car during the surveillance \r\n  of the gas station and testified that â€œit would not have been conducive for \r\n  me to be within a line of sight of the suspects or where the deal was taking \r\n  place.â€ Â Oâ€™Quinn did not speak with the confidential informant nor with Dunbar, \r\n  and was not present and did not observe Rainwater retrieve the cocaine from \r\n  the car.Â  There is no evidence the magistrate even inquired concerning Oâ€™Quinnâ€™s \r\n  knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavit.Â  Oâ€™Quinn stated the facts in \r\n  the affidavit came from â€œno place elseâ€ but Rainwater.Â  After signing the affidavit \r\n  and obtaining the search warrant, Oâ€™Quinn delivered the warrant to the officers \r\n  waiting at the hotel.Â  \r\nIn State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  675 (2000), our Supreme Court stated the constitutional and statutory requirements \r\n  for issuing a search warrant:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly has imposed stricter requirements than \r\n  federal law for issuing a search warrant.Â  Both the Fourth Amendment of the \r\n  United States Constitution and Article I, Â§ 10 of the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  require an oath or affirmation before probable cause can be found by an officer \r\n  of the court, and a search warrant issued.Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. \r\n  art. I, Â§ 10.Â  Additionally, the South Carolina Code mandates that a search \r\n  warrant â€œshall be issued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate, \r\n  municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985).\r\n\r\nId. at 128, 536 S.E.2d at 678.Â  \r\nâ€œAn affidavit is a voluntary ex parte statement \r\n  reduced to writing and sworn to or affirmed before some person legally authorized \r\n  to administer an oath or affirmation.â€Â  State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, \r\n  113, 352 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1987); see also Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n  58 (7th ed. 1999) (defining an affidavit as a â€œvoluntary declaration of facts \r\n  written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer \r\n  oathsâ€).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn McKnight, our Supreme Court found a warrant \r\n  defective where a sworn officer orally recited facts upon which the warrant \r\n  was based but never executed an affidavit. \r\n  [3] Â  The Supreme Court found that such a sworn, oral statement may be sufficient \r\n  to satisfy constitutional requirements, but the statement would not satisfy \r\n  the statutory requirement of an affidavit.Â  McKnight, 291 S.C. at 113, \r\n  352 S.E.2d at 472.Â  McKnight required an affiant to execute a written \r\n  affidavit.Â  Similarly, in this case Officer Rainwater orally recited facts relating \r\n  to the probable cause for the warrant but did not execute an affidavit.Â  Instead, \r\n  Rainwater sent Oâ€™Quinn to sign an affidavit drafted by the magistrate.Â  \r\nUnder these facts, the statutory mandate requiring \r\n  that a search warrant be based on an affidavit was not met because the affiant \r\n  did not recite any of the facts stated in the affidavit and his direct personal \r\n  knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavit was limited to the delivery of \r\n  cocaine.Â  The affiant, Oâ€™Quinn, did not prepare an affidavit and the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  recitation of the facts in the affidavit was not verified by anyone known by \r\n  the magistrate to possess knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavit.Â  Because \r\n  Oâ€™Quinn had no direct personal knowledge of numerous facts, he could not have \r\n  sworn to the truth of the statements in the affidavit.Â  At oral argument, the \r\n  State explained Oâ€™Quinn was swearing that he believed the statements \r\n  in the affidavit were truthful.Â  The statutory affidavit requirement is not \r\n  met where one officer recites facts over the phone to a magistrate, the magistrate \r\n  drafts an affidavit, and subsequently an affiant who offers no facts establishing \r\n  probable cause signs the affidavit.Â  In essence, like McKnight, the magistrate \r\n  was never presented with an affidavit executed by the affiant.\r\nThis opinion in no way affects the validity of \r\n  search warrants issued through the use of hearsay.Â  See, e.g., State \r\n  v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976) (recognizing the validity \r\n  of an affiant attesting to information supplied him by a fellow officer).Â  Here, \r\n  there is no evidence Oâ€™Quinn repeated to the magistrate any facts he may have \r\n  obtained from other officers.Â  The dissent characterizes this as a hearsay case \r\n  and upholds the validity of the warrant based in part on Oâ€™Quinnâ€™s hearsay knowledge.Â  \r\n  Even assuming in this case Oâ€™Quinn obtained knowledge as a result of hearsay, \r\n  it is of no consequence given Oâ€™Quinn did not relate any of this information \r\n  to the magistrate and did not present an affidavit.Â  \r\nAs the dissent correctly notes, an affidavit can \r\n  show probable cause even when based on hearsay.Â  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at \r\n  614, 230 S.E.2d at 623.Â  However, any probable cause established in the affidavit \r\n  here is not based on hearsay, it is based on oral statements by an officer who \r\n  did not present an affidavit. \r\nA search warrant affidavit insufficient in itself \r\n  to establish probable cause may be supplemented by sworn oral testimony.Â  Jones, \r\n  342 S.C. at 128, 536 S.E.2d at 678-679; McKnight, 291 S.C. at 113, 352 \r\n  S.E.2d at 472.Â  â€œHowever, sworn oral testimony, standing alone, does not satisfy \r\n  the statute.â€Â  Id. at 113, 352 S.E.2d at 473.Â  Even if Rainwaterâ€™s telephone \r\n  conversation with the magistrate was under oath, Rainwater presented only sworn \r\n  oral testimony, not an affidavit.Â  The rule allowing supplementation presupposes \r\n  an affiant presented the magistrate with a written affidavit.Â  If not presented \r\n  with an affidavit, the magistrate is left to depend totally on oral information.Â  \r\n  A magistrate cannot depend solely on oral testimony in issuing a search warrant.Â  \r\n  Here, Rainwaterâ€™s oral statements to the magistrate did not supplement \r\n  an affidavit.Â  Rather, the magistrate used the statements to draft the affidavit \r\n  subsequently signed by an affiant who did not supply the magistrate with any \r\n  facts.Â  This procedure did not satisfy section 17-13-140.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court erred in refusing to \r\n  suppress the evidence obtained during the search of the hotel room.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court properly admitted \r\n  the cocaine found in the car into evidence and we thus affirm Dunbarâ€™s conviction \r\n  for trafficking in cocaine of more than one hundred but less than two hundred \r\n  grams of cocaine.Â  The trial court erred in refusing to suppress the powder \r\n  and crack cocaine found in the hotel room and we therefore reverse Dunbarâ€™s \r\n  convictions for trafficking in cocaine of more than 200 grams and less than \r\n  400 grams, and trafficking in crack cocaine.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART. \r\nSTILWELL, J. concurs and ANDERSON, J. dissents in \r\n  a separate opinion.\r\n ANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  \r\n  The majority concludes the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence \r\n  obtained as a result of the search of the motel room because the search warrant \r\n  was based on an affidavit signed by a law enforcement officer who had no direct \r\n  knowledge of the information contained in the affidavit.Â  I disagree.Â  I vote \r\n  to affirm.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  \r\n  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  We are bound by \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State \r\n  v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).Â  This same standard \r\n  of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility \r\n  of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  at 829.Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused \r\n  his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State \r\n  v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 391 S.E.2d 244 (1990).Â  This Court does not \r\n  re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence \r\n  but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â \r\nWilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; see also State v. \r\n  Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000) (an abuse of discretion is \r\n  a conclusion with no reasonable factual support).\r\nAn appellate court reviewing the decision to issue a search warrant \r\n  should decide whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding \r\n  probable cause existed.Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 \r\n  (Ct. App 2002).Â  This review, like the determination by the magistrate, is governed \r\n  by the â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ test.Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. \r\n  121, 536 S.E.2d 675 (2000); King, 349 S.C. at 148, 561 S.E.2d at 643.Â  \r\n  The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense \r\n  decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before \r\n  him, including the â€œveracityâ€ and â€œbasis of knowledgeâ€ of persons supplying \r\n  hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence \r\n  of a crime will be found in a particular place.Â  Illinois v. Gates, 462 \r\n  U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).Â  The appellate court should \r\n  give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable cause.Â  State \r\n  v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997); see also State \r\n  v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976) (magistrateâ€™s determination \r\n  of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing court).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Requirement of Sworn Affidavit\r\nâ€œBoth the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, \r\n  Â§ 10 of the South Carolina Constitution require an oath or affirmation before \r\n  probable cause can be found by an officer of the court, and a search warrant \r\n  issued.â€Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2000).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the South Carolina Code mandates that a search warrant shall be \r\n  issued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate, municipal judicial \r\n  officer, or judge of a court of record establishing the grounds for the warrant. \r\n  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985).Â  The purpose of the statute requiring \r\n  that a warrant be issued only upon affidavit is to provide for timely recording \r\n  of facts presented to a judicial officer.Â  State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541, \r\n  216 S.E.2d 501 (1975).\r\n  II.&nbsp; Sufficiency of Affidavit Supporting\r\nSearch Warrant\r\nAn affidavit in support of a search warrant may be based on hearsay information \r\n  and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant.Â  State \r\n  v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976); see alsoÂ Â  Jones \r\n  v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. \r\n  2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980) (affidavit for search warrant which sets out personal \r\n  observations relating to existence of cause to search is not to be deemed insufficient \r\n  by virtue of fact that it sets out not the affiantâ€™s observations but those \r\n  of another, so long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented).Â  \r\n  An affidavit can show probable cause even when based on hearsay statements.Â  \r\n  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at 614, 230 S.E.2d at 623;Â  see also Morris \r\n  v. State, 62 S.W.3d 817 (Tex. App. 2001) (information with which magistrate \r\n  is supplied, in affidavit for search warrant, may be hearsay).\r\nHearsay, even second hearsay, may provide a legal basis for a search warrant.Â  \r\n  United States v. Welebir, 498 F.2d 346 (4th Cir. 1974); see also \r\n  State v. York, 250 S.C. 30, 156 S.E.2d 326 (1967) (affidavit for search \r\n  warrant may be based on hearsay information); State v. Elkhill, 715 So. \r\n  2d 327 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (finding affidavit established probable cause \r\n  to search defendantâ€™s residence for drugs, even though affiant did not continuously \r\n  observe confidential informant during controlled buy; informant was under almost \r\n  constant supervision of one of two officers during buy, and what affiant did \r\n  not see, the other officer did; as long as specific facts are set forth to justify \r\n  finding of probable cause to issue search warrant, those facts may be based \r\n  on hearsay information).\r\nThe fact that the information provided is double hearsay is relevant to its \r\n  value in determining probable cause, but hearsay testimony will not per se invalidate \r\n  a judgeâ€™s determination of probable cause.Â  State v. Taylor, 612 N.E.2d \r\n  728 (Ohio Ct. App. 1992).Â  The fact that the affiantâ€™s knowledge may be the \r\n  result of double or multiple levels of hearsay does not, per se, invalidate \r\n  the resulting search warrant.Â  United States v. Jenkins, 525 F.2d 819 \r\n  (6th Cir. 1975); see also United States v. One Hundred Forty-Nine \r\n  Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Two and 43/100 Dollars ($149,442.43) in U.S. Currency, \r\n  965 F.2d 868 (10th Cir. 1992) (hearsay, even multiple hearsay, may be used to \r\n  establish probable cause for a search warrant); United States v. McCoy, \r\n  478 F.2d 176 (10th Cir. 1973) (fact that affidavit in support of search warrant \r\n  contains some double hearsay and perhaps even a bit of triple hearsay does not \r\n  in and of itself render the affidavit insufficient).\r\nThe fact that there is hearsay upon hearsay involved in a case, as far as the \r\n  information upon which the affidavit is based, does not preclude a finding of \r\n  probable cause.Â  Lewis v. State, 508 S.E.2d 218 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998); \r\n  see also Hennessy v. State, 660 S.W.2d 87 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983) \r\n  (when viewing the affidavit, hearsay upon hearsay will support issuance of warrant \r\n  as long as underlying circumstances indicate there is a substantial basis for \r\n  crediting hearsay at each level).\r\nIII.Â  Direct Knowledge of Affiant Officer Not Required\r\nThe propriety of an affiant attesting to information supplied him by a fellow \r\n  officer has been judicially endorsed.Â  State v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, \r\n  230 S.E.2d 621 (1976).Â  It is well settled that an affiant seeking a search \r\n  warrant can base his information on information in turn supplied him by fellow \r\n  officers.Â  United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 684 (1965); United States v. Welebir, 498 F.2d 346 (4th Cir. \r\n  1974).Â  Observations by fellow law enforcement officers engaged in a common \r\n  investigation with the search warrant affiant are a reliable basis for a warrant \r\n  applied for by one of their number.Â  Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 111, 85 S.Ct. \r\n  at 747, 13 L.Ed.2d at 690; State v. Hage, 568 N.W.2d 741 (N.D. 1997).Â  \r\n  See also United States v. Morales, 238 F.3d 952 (8th Cir. 2001) \r\n  (probable cause may be based on collective knowledge of all law enforcement \r\n  officers involved in an investigation and need not be based solely on information \r\n  within knowledge of officer on scene if there is some degree of communication).Â  \r\n\r\nProbable cause is to be evaluated by the collective information of the police \r\n  as reflected in the affidavit and is not limited to the firsthand knowledge \r\n  of the officer who executes the affidavit.Â  State v. Stickelman, 299 \r\n  N.W.2d 520 (Neb. 1980); see also Iddings v. State, 772 N.E.2d \r\n  1006 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (probable cause for a search warrant may be based \r\n  upon information known to the law enforcement organization as a whole).Â  A police \r\n  officer making the affidavit for issuance of a warrant may do so in reliance \r\n  upon information reported to him by other officers in the performance of their \r\n  duties.Â  State v. Pearson, 566 S.E.2d 50 (N.C. 2002).\r\nIt is not unusual for an affidavit of a law enforcement officer to contain \r\n  hearsay information from another, which, in turn, is based on other information \r\n  gathered by that person.Â  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at 615, 230 S.E.2d at 623.Â  \r\n  Hence, when a magistrate receives an affidavit which contains hearsay upon hearsay, \r\n  he need not categorically reject this double hearsay information.Â  Sullivan, \r\n  267 S.C. at 615, 230 S.E.2d at 623.Â  Rather, he is called upon to evaluate this \r\n  information as well as all other information in the affidavit in order to determine \r\n  whether it can be reasonably inferred that the information was gained in a reliable \r\n  way.Â  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at 615, 230 S.E.2d at 623-24.\r\nIV.Â  Efficacy of Affidavit in Present Case\r\nThe affidavit in the present case clearly justified the issuance of the warrant.Â  \r\n  Officer Keith Oâ€™Quinn was â€œpart of the initial responding units for the take-down \r\n  of the operationâ€ and was at the scene of the arrest.Â  Oâ€™Quinn testified that \r\n  he had â€œpersonal knowledge . . . that a narcotics deal had been performed at \r\n  the Exxon station on Bush River Roadâ€ and that two subjects had been arrested.Â  \r\n  Officer Oâ€™Quinn had knowledge there was cocaine in the car.Â  He declared that, \r\n  â€œ[b]ased on [his] conversation in dealing with Investigator Rainwater,â€ he obtained \r\n  a search warrant.Â  Oâ€™Quinn signed an affidavit based on information which was \r\n  obtained through a joint investigation.Â  When asked â€œ[w]as there a reason for \r\n  the belief contained in the affidavit that there was cocaine in Sheraton (sic) \r\n  room 158,â€ Officer Oâ€™Quinn responded: â€œFrom the information that I gathered \r\n  that was told to Investigator Rainwater by the C.I., yes, sir, there was.â€Â  \r\n  Moreover, although Officer Rainwater actually communicated the information to \r\n  the magistrate, Officer Oâ€™Quinn read over and reviewed the affidavit for accuracy \r\n  before he signed it.\r\nI find the affidavit was properly executed.Â  The affidavit included \r\n  information Officer Oâ€™Quinn learned through his participation in the investigation, \r\n  as well as hearsay information.Â  Thus, the affidavit justified the issuance \r\n  of the search warrant.Â  Under the totality of the circumstances, the magistrate \r\n  had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed.Â  I would affirm \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow the evidence obtained as a result of the \r\n  search of the motel room.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe opinion of the majority acknowledges the viability of the rule \r\n  that hearsay is admissible to show probable cause.Â  This declaration rings hollow \r\n  because the majority opinion neglects to give any efficacy to the rule.\r\nWith etymological precision, the majority in cathartic verbiage concludes \r\n  the rule should not be applied.Â  The statement is made that the magistrate never \r\n  heard the â€œhearsay.â€Â  The record belies this averment.\r\nThe judicial embargo countenanced by the majority flies in the face \r\n  of the universal rule of evidence allowing â€œhearsay, even second hearsayâ€ to \r\n  determine probable cause in the magisterial warrant scenario.\r\nWithout question, the appellate entity will â€œrue the dayâ€ of the \r\n  â€œstatutory affidavit deficiencyâ€ rule adopted in this case.Â  This court-created \r\n  albatross in search warrant proceedings is anathema to the law extant in the \r\n  field of criminal law.\r\n I VOTE TO AFFIRM.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Rainwater testified he was unaware at the time of the telephone conversation \r\n    whether the informant was speaking with the defendant, Dunbar, or with Jonathan \r\n    Small. Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The affidavit stated:\r\n  \r\n  That a confidential informant \r\n    stated that the subject stays at motel while in the area, that Co Def stated \r\n    that the subject left Ramada Inn at I-26 [at] 378 after Co-Def called subject \r\n    in that room, that Co Def saw subject leave location to pick him up at location \r\n    across from Ramada, that subject had on his possession a key to said room, \r\n    that subject delivered approx. 5oz. of cocaine to undercover agents. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  The record does not indicate Rainwater was sworn.Â  The magistrate \r\n    placed Oâ€™Quinn under oath before he signed the affidavit.Â  However, Oâ€™Quinn \r\n    was unaware whether Rainwater was under oath during the telephone conversation \r\n    with the magistrate.Â  See State v. York, 250 S.C. 30, 156 S.E.2d \r\n    326 (1967) (finding a sheriffâ€™s testimony that he had a â€œconversationâ€ with \r\n    a magistrate was insufficient to establish that the sheriff furnished information \r\n    under oath or affirmation).Â  Assuming, as we must, given the lack of evidence \r\n    on this point in the record, the magistrate did not place Rainwater under \r\n    oath, the search warrant issued in this case offends even the less stringent \r\n    constitutional standard requiring a search warrant be â€œsupported by oath or \r\n    affirmation.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10; see also \r\n    State v. Wimbush, 9 S.C. 309 (1877) (finding a warrant illegal where \r\n    the information on which the warrant was founded was not given upon oath).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3632","title":"State v.

Aragon appeals his \r\n  convictions for 1) simple assault and battery and 2) assault and battery of \r\n  a high and aggravated nature.Â  His appeal focuses entirely upon the admission \r\n  by the trial court of a taped conversation between him and one of the victims.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nAragon assaulted two women one evening.Â  \r\n  He admitted he slapped one of them.Â  That victim, however, complained of a more \r\n  extensive assault upon her.Â  She stated that Aragon, among other things, smashed \r\n  her head against a door jamb, rammed a chair into her stomach, dragged her from \r\n  her bedroom into the kitchen, and made her plead for her life while threatening \r\n  to stab her.Â  \r\nFollowing the assault and at the request of the \r\n  investigating officer, the victim called Aragon from the sheriffâ€™s office and \r\n  engaged him in a taped conversation.Â  The solicitorâ€™s office took custody of \r\n  the tape after the victim reviewed it.Â  The State introduced the tape into evidence.Â  \r\n  Aragon argues the State failed to properly authenticate the tape because the \r\n  State did not establish a chain of custody.Â  \r\nWe think the State, consistent with the \r\n  requirements of Rule 901, SCRE, [2] \r\n   regarding authentication, sufficiently established that the tape in question \r\n  is what it claimed.Â  The victim who made the call to Aragon testified that she \r\n  had known him for over ten years and once had a relationship with him, that \r\n  she telephoned Aragon from the sheriffâ€™s office and knew the conversation was \r\n  taped, that she listened to the tape, that she recognized the tape from her \r\n  initials on it, that the tape fairly and accurately represented the phone conversation, \r\n  and that the tape had not been edited or altered in any way. [3] Â  \r\nAs for establishing a chain of custody, \r\n  that was not necessary since the tape was otherwise authenticated. [4] \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n&nbsp;HEARN, C.J., and SHULER, J., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  \r\n    Rule 901, SCRE, provides as follows:\r\n  \r\n  (a)Â  General Provision.Â  The requirement of authentication \r\n    or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by \r\n    evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what \r\n    its proponent claims.\r\n  (b)Â  Illustrations.Â  By way of illustration only, and \r\n    not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or \r\n    identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:\r\n    \r\n  (1)Â  Testimony of Witness With Knowledge.Â  Testimony \r\n    that a matter is what it is claimed to be.\r\n  . . .\r\n  (5)Â  Voice Identification.Â  Identification of a voice, \r\n    whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or \r\n    recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances \r\n    connecting it with the alleged speaker.Â  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  After the tape was admitted and published, the \r\n    victim further testified she knew her conversation was held with Aragon because \r\n    she dialed his number and she recognized his voice.Â  See Rule 901(b)(6), \r\n    SCRE (stating that an example of authentication regarding telephone conversations \r\n    may include â€œevidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time \r\n    by the telephone company to a particular person or business. . . .â€).Â  At \r\n    no point in his testimony did Aragon challenge the genuineness of the tape \r\n    or in any way suggest the tape had been tampered with.Â  Indeed, he seemed \r\n    to embrace the correctness of the tape, saying when questioned about its contents, \r\n    â€œWhat I said on the tape you heard it.Â  Itâ€™s all on the tape.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  See United States v.

Raman, of Spartanburg; for Appellant.\r\nDonald E. Rothwell and Scott L. Hood, both of Irmo; for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Loren John Murphy appeals from a \r\n  circuit court order denying his request for a witness fee and mileage for attending \r\n  a deposition in an action in which Murphy was the plaintiff.Â  Murphy contends \r\n  the circuit court erred because a party who testifies at a deposition is a witness \r\n  entitled to the witness fee and mileage pursuant to Rule 30(a)(2), SCRCP.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1984, Murphy executed a Money Line Agreement \r\n  with NationsBank in order to obtain a $25,000.00 revolving line of credit. \r\n  Murphy defaulted on his repayment obligation to NationsBank, and in 1993, \r\n  the bank agreed to accept a lump sum payment from him in full satisfaction of \r\n  the account. NationsBank continued to report the account as charged off to consumer \r\n  credit reporting agencies.Â  Murphy commenced this action against NationsBank \r\n  in 1999, seeking actual and punitive damages because of the bankâ€™s action in \r\n  allegedly filing a false credit report about Murphy.Â  NationsBank answered, \r\n  denying liability and asserting numerous defenses, among them that the credit \r\n  information provided by it concerning Murphy was true.Â  \r\nDuring the course of the lawsuit, NationsBank noticed \r\n  the deposition of Murphy.Â  Counsel for Murphy then notified NationsBank that \r\n  Murphy expected to receive a witness fee of $25.00 and mileage, for a total \r\n  of $29.14.Â  NationsBank then filed a notice of motion and motion to enforce \r\n  discovery.Â  On June 28, 2001, a hearing on NationsBankâ€™s motion was heard before \r\n  the Honorable John C. Hayes, III.Â Â  Judge Hayes ruled that a party such as Murphy \r\n  was not entitled to the witness fee and mileage under Rule 30(a)(2), and compelled \r\n  Murphy to appear for his deposition. Thereafter, by order dated February 1, \r\n  2002, the Honorable Donald W. Beatty granted summary judgment to NationsBank \r\n  based on the statute of limitations. Murphy appeals Judge Hayesâ€™ decision \r\n  to deny him the witness fee and mileage.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRule 30(a)(2), SCRCP, sets forth certain limitations \r\n  on depositions.Â  The first paragraph of the subsection provides: â€œA witness \r\n  (excluding a party) may be compelled to attend only in the county in which \r\n  he resides or is employed or transacts his business in person, or at such other \r\n  convenient place as is fixed by an order of the court.â€ (Emphasis added.)Â  The \r\n  second paragraph states:Â  â€œThe deposition of any party or witness may \r\n  only be taken one time in any case except by agreement of the parties through \r\n  their counsel or by order of the court for good cause shown.â€ (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\n  The third paragraph of the subsection, which is the one at issue here, provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nA witness attending any deposition held pursuant \r\n  to these rules shall receive for each dayâ€™s attendance and for the time necessarily \r\n  occupied in going to and returning from the same, $25.00 per day, and mileage \r\n  for going from and returning to his place of residence, in the same amounts \r\n  as provided by law for official travel of state officers and employees. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nÂ Judge Hayes, in ruling that Murphy, as a party, \r\n  was not entitled to the witness fee and mileage, noted that Rule 30(a)(2) accorded \r\n  different status to witnesses and parties.Â  Murphy, however, relied upon the \r\n  case of Perry v. Minit Saver Food Stores of South Carolina, Inc., 255 \r\n  S.C. 42, 177 S.E.2d 4 (1970), for the proposition that a party who testifies \r\n  at a deposition is a witness and is entitled to the witness fee and mileage.Â  \r\n  This 1970 decision is the basis for the truncated argument in Murphyâ€™s brief.Â  \r\n\r\nWe agree with Judge Hayes that Rule 30(a)(2), SCRCP, \r\n  clearly treats witnesses and parties differently.Â  The first paragraph of the \r\n  subsection deals with witnesses and specifically excludes parties.Â  The second \r\n  subsection, by its language, applies to both parties and witnesses, and \r\n  the third paragraph, which is applicable here, is limited to â€œa witness \r\n  attending any deposition.â€Â  (emphasis added)Â  By its plain language, the paragraph \r\n  of the subsection concerning witness fees and mileage applies only to witnesses.Â  \r\n  The Perry case relied on by Murphy is inapposite because it pre-dates \r\n  the adoption of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  See Sunamerica \r\n  Finâ€™l Corp. v. Equi-Data, Inc., 299 S.C. 175, 177, 383 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1989) \r\n  (holding that cases decided prior to the adoption of the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Civil Procedure are inapplicable when deciding an issue involving construction \r\n  of a rule).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3634","title":"Murray v.

Knie, of Spartanburg; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Margaret Murray sued Bank of \r\n  America, formerly known as NationsBank, (Bank) alleging it was negligent when \r\n  it allowed an imposter to open an account in her name.Â  The jury awarded Murray \r\n  $300,000 in actual damages.Â  The Bank appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMargaret Murray lost her driverâ€™s license \r\n  in May 1997.Â  On May 14, 1997, a woman opened an account with the Bank in Murrayâ€™s \r\n  name.Â  The imposter presented Murrayâ€™s driverâ€™s license and a social security \r\n  card to the Bank employee and deposited $100.00 in the account.Â  The employee \r\n  contacted Check Systems, which is a company that verifies credit, to determine \r\n  if Murray had any prior check writing problems.Â  Check Systems did not reveal \r\n  any detrimental information about Murray.Â  The imposter wrote sixty fraudulent \r\n  checks from the account totaling approximately $7,500.Â  \r\nMurray had never had a checking account \r\n  with the Bank or any other bank.Â  Murray did not become aware of the account \r\n  opened in her name until employees of Thermax Carpet Cleaning came to her apartment \r\n  and asked for her to return a rented carpet cleaner.Â  When Murray went to Thermax, \r\n  the manager established that she was not the one who rented the cleaner.Â  The \r\n  manager told Murray that the cleaner had been rented by someone writing a check \r\n  in her name with the account at the Bank.Â  \r\nOn June 2, 1997, Murray went to the Bank and discovered \r\n  an imposter had opened the account in her name using her driverâ€™s license.Â  \r\n  Murray demanded the Bank close the account.Â  She also requested the Bank inform \r\n  the merchants who submitted the checks that were returned for insufficient funds \r\n  that she was innocent and that this was a fraudulent account.Â  She testified \r\n  that she trusted the Bank to take the requested actions.Â  The Bank, however, \r\n  failed to close the account until June 30, 1997.Â  Murray also reported the fraudulent \r\n  account to the police.Â  \r\nIn November 1997, Murray was arrested \r\n  in front of her son, and served with warrants for fifteen fraudulent checks.Â  \r\n  Murray spent twelve hours in jail.Â  After Murray was arrested, she obtained \r\n  a letter from the Bank stating she was not the one who opened the account.Â  \r\n  Murray went to the post office box the imposter provided the bank and found \r\n  forty-four letters merchants had written her about the bad checks.Â  \r\nMurray was required to appear at three \r\n  criminal court hearings.Â  Although she was exonerated of the criminal charges \r\n  she faced, Murray continued to worry about the existence of other unresolved \r\n  checks.Â  She suffered from stress and anxiety from the incident and had difficulty \r\n  sleeping.Â  Her face tightened and became numb.Â  She sought medical treatment \r\n  from the local hospital.Â  Murray was embarrassed by being arrested in front \r\n  of her son and her neighbors and felt she had to move into another apartment, \r\n  which was more expensive than the one she had lived in before.Â  \r\nMurray sued the Bank in negligence.Â  The \r\n  Bank moved for directed verdict at the close of Murrayâ€™s case asserting the \r\n  Bank did not owe any duty of care to Murray.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  \r\n  The jury found for Murray and awarded her $300,000 in damages.Â  The trial court \r\n  denied the Bankâ€™s post trial motions.Â  The Bank appealed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Existence of a Duty of CareÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Bank asserts the trial court erred when it \r\n  denied the Bankâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the \r\n  trial court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be \r\n  drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  \r\n  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. \r\n  373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).Â  The trial court must deny the motions \r\n  when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The appellate courts will reverse the trial court only when there \r\n  is no evidence to support the ruling below or the ruling is controlled by an \r\n  error of law.Â  Id. \r\nIn order to establish a claim for negligence \r\n  the plaintiff must prove the following elements:Â  1) a duty of care owed by \r\n  the defendant to the plaintiff; 2) a breach of that duty by the defendantâ€™s \r\n  negligent act or omission; 3) the plaintiff was damaged; and 4) the damages \r\n  proximately resulted from the breach of the duty.Â  Thomasko v. Poole, \r\n  349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002).Â  â€œAn essential element in a cause \r\n  of action for negligence is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the \r\n  defendant to the plaintiff.â€Â  Bishop v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, \r\n  331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 76, 81 (1998).Â  The issue of whether the law recognizes \r\n  a particular duty is an issue of law to be decided by the court.Â  Ellis by \r\n  Ellis v. Niles, 324 S.C. 223, 479 S.E.2d 47 (1996).\r\nDuty is generally defined as â€œthe obligation to \r\n  conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.â€Â  Shipes v. Piggly \r\n  Wiggly St. Andrews 269 S.C. 479, 483, 238 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1977).Â  Ordinarily, \r\n  the common law imposes no duty on a person to act.Â  Carson v. Adgar, \r\n  326 S.C. 212, 486 S.E.2d 3 (1997).Â  An affirmative legal duty to act exists \r\n  if created by statute, contract, relationship, status, property interest, or \r\n  some other special circumstance.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn June 2, Murray went to the Bank and spoke with \r\n  Thomas Wright, a former vice-president and banking center manager with the Bank.Â  \r\n  She testified that she requested the Bank close the fraudulent account and notify \r\n  the merchants who submitted checks written on the account that the account was \r\n  fraudulent.Â  When she left, she felt assured that the Bank would handle the \r\n  matter.Â  Wright testified he notified the Bankâ€™s headquarters in Charlotte on \r\n  May 21, 1997 that the account was overdrawn and requested its closure.Â  The \r\n  Bank did not close the account until June 30, 1997, which was almost a month \r\n  after Murray requested it close the account and notify the merchants.Â  Wright \r\n  stated the Bank failed to follow its own procedures.Â  \r\nWe find a relationship between the Bank and Murray \r\n  arose sufficient to impose upon the Bank a duty of care when Murray went to \r\n  the Bank seeking closure of the account.Â  The Bank failed to follow its own \r\n  procedures, did not timely close the account, and did not notify any merchants \r\n  that the account was fraudulent.Â  We find sufficient evidence in the record \r\n  from which the jury could determine the Bank breached its duty to Murray after \r\n  this duty arose.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in denying \r\n  the Bankâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nII.Â  New trial absolute\r\nThe Bank argues the trial court erred \r\n  in denying its motion for a new trial absolute as the jury verdict was so large \r\n  it must have been the result of caprice, prejudice, or passion.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s decision to deny a \r\n  motion for new trial absolute is within its discretion and will not be reversed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali \r\n  Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996).Â  When deciding a motion to \r\n  grant a new trial, the court must look at the testimony and inferences raised \r\n  in favor of the nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The court should only grant a motion for a \r\n  new trial absolute when the verdict is so grossly excessive that it shocks the \r\n  conscience of the court and clearly indicates the verdict was the result of \r\n  caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or other improper motive.Â  \r\n  Knoke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, 324 \r\n  S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996).Â  A juryâ€™s determination of damages \r\n  is entitled to substantial deference by this court.Â  Id.Â  Mere undue \r\n  liberality on the part of the jury does not warrant an inference that the verdict \r\n  resulted from caprice, passion, prejudice, or other improper motives.Â  Hutson \r\n  v. Cummins Carolinas, Inc. 280 S.C. 552, 559, 314 S.E.2d 19, 24 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984). \r\nMurray was arrested in front of her son \r\n  and taken to the police car in front of her neighbors, causing her great humiliation.Â  \r\n  She spent twelve hours in jail.Â  Although Murray suffers from a kidney ailment, \r\n  the jail attendant refused to allow her to use the bathroom, increasing her \r\n  embarrassment and discomfort.Â  Due to her stress over the situation, Murray \r\n  suffered from sleeplessness.Â  In addition, her face tightened up and became \r\n  numb, prompting a visit to the doctor.Â  She had to hire a lawyer and attend \r\n  three hearings on the warrants.Â  She stated that after her arrest, she was terrified \r\n  that the police would come back and arrest her again on more charges.Â  Due to \r\n  her acute embarrassment of being arrested in front of her neighbors, she moved \r\n  to a more expensive apartment, which strained her finances and caused more stress.Â  \r\n\r\nMost of the damages Murray suffered were \r\n  intangible.Â  â€œOne cannot easily or with any mathematical certainty place a value \r\n  on the amount of a personâ€™s pain and suffering.â€Â  Smalls v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Educ., 339 S.C. 208, 218, 528 S.E.2d 682, 687 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  We find the juryâ€™s verdict of $300,000 is not so shocking to the conscience \r\n  of the court that it clearly indicates the verdict was the result of improper \r\n  motive.Â  Thus, we hold the trial court did not err in denying the Bankâ€™s motion \r\n  for a new trial absolute.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Supplemental jury instructionÂ Â  \r\nThe Bank argues the trial court committed \r\n  reversible error by giving supplemental jury instructions.\r\nAfter it began deliberations, the jury \r\n  requested additional instructions from the trial court on actual damages.Â  The \r\n  court repeated its earlier charge on actual damages.Â  After the jury left the \r\n  courtroom, Murrayâ€™s attorney suggested the jury may have been wondering what \r\n  can be considered as elements of actual damages.Â  The court agreed.Â  The Bank \r\n  objected to the court giving an additional charge, asserting the courtâ€™s original \r\n  charge was a fair statement of the law and Murray had waived any objection by \r\n  failing to object after the original charge.Â  Over the Bankâ€™s objection, the \r\n  court charged the jury:\r\n\r\nOkay let me talk to you a little bit about [actual damages].Â  \r\n  Mental anguish, pain and suffering, loss of [t]he enjoyment of life, meaning \r\n  not being able to do the kinds of things you normally did or you did prior to \r\n  the incident, embarrassment.Â  Those kinds are things that can be considered \r\n  as actual damages.Â  Youâ€™re not limited to medical bills, that kind of thing, \r\n  in determining actual damages.Â  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Bank first argues Murray \r\n  waived the right to complain about the courtâ€™s charge on actual damages.Â  It \r\n  relies on Lundy v. Lititz Mutual Insurance Company, 232 S.C. 1, 100 S.E.2d \r\n  544 (1957), in which the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the main charge, the trial Judge . . \r\n  . excused the jury and asked counsel if any further instructions were desired \r\n  or if there were any objections to the charge.Â  No objection was offered by \r\n  either party but appellantâ€™s counsel requested an additional instruction relating \r\n  to a certain phase of the case.Â  The jury was then recalled and the requested \r\n  instruction given.Â  After doing so, the Court gave certain other instructions \r\n  which appellant now contends constituted a charge on the facts.Â  However, in \r\n  the main charge, . . . the Court gave substantially the same instructions as \r\n  those now complained of.Â  If appellant thought these instructions violated Article \r\n  5, Section 26 of the Constitution, which we are inclined to think they did, \r\n  counsel should have made timely objection when the jury was excused at the conclusion \r\n  of the main charge.Â  They waived the objection by failing to do so.Â  Appellant \r\n  cannot now complain of the Court's repeating substantially the same instructions \r\n  to which counsel failed to object when given an opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nId. at 10, 100 S.E.2d at 548.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is certainly true that an appellant \r\n  who failed to object to a jury charge at the first opportunity cannot complain \r\n  about the charge on appeal.Â  However, that appellate rule of error preservation \r\n  does not prevent the trial court from supplementing its charge if it decides \r\n  to do so.Â  \r\nThe Bank also argues the trial court \r\n  erred in giving the supplemental charge because it emphasized the recoverability \r\n  of damages for mental distress.Â  The Bank, however, did not raise this objection \r\n  to the trial court when it gave the supplemental charge.Â  Accordingly, we find \r\n  this argument is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Benton, 338 \r\n  S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000) (stating issue not preserved if party argues \r\n  one ground for objection at trial and a different ground on appeal).\r\nIV.Â  Statements in closing argument.Â  \r\nThe Bank argues Murrayâ€™s counsel made \r\n  improper remarks to the jury during his closing.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Bank first contends Murrayâ€™s counsel attempted to appeal \r\n  to the sympathy of the jury by asking them to put themselves in Murrayâ€™s place.Â  \r\n  During the closing, Murrayâ€™s counsel stated, â€œAnd on November 25th, \r\n  1997, some four or five months later, thereâ€™s an officer at her door, and just \r\n  put yourself in your home, in your home---.â€Â  The Bankâ€™s attorney objected.\r\nThe following colloquy then occurred:\r\n\r\nThe Court:Â  Mr. Knie (Murrayâ€™s attorney).\r\nMr. Knie: Okay.\r\nMr. Brown (the Bankâ€™s attorney):Â  Thatâ€™s improper.\r\nThe Court:Â  Rephrase that, sir.\r\nMr. Knie:Â  Just try to imagine the---\r\nMr. Brown:Â  Again, Your Honor, heâ€™s asking them to imagine being \r\n  in that same position.Â  Itâ€™s improper.\r\nThe Court:Â  Mr. Knie.\r\nMr. Knie:Â  All right.Â  Iâ€™ll do my best, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the trial court did not use \r\n  the word â€œsustain,â€ it is obvious that the court sustained the Bankâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  objection.Â  The Bankâ€™s attorney failed to ask the trial court to strike the \r\n  statement or give the jury a curative instruction.Â  We find the Bankâ€™s argument \r\n  complaining about Murrayâ€™s attorneyâ€™s comments is not properly before this court.Â  \r\n  See State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 18, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997) \r\n  (holding the alleged impropriety of closing argument was not preserved for review \r\n  where the trial court sustained an objection by opposing counsel, but counsel \r\n  did not move to strike or request a curative instruction).Â  \r\nThe Bank also argues that during his \r\n  closing argument Murrayâ€™s counsel improperly sought the jury to make a judgment \r\n  regarding questions of law.Â  During the closing, the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\nMR. KNIE:Â  I asked for permission to publish what [the Bankâ€™s] \r\n  net worth was, and obviously it was met with objection as you could well imagine.\r\nMR. BROWN:Â  Iâ€™m gonna object to that.Â  Itâ€™s for the Court \r\n  to decide objections.Â  Itâ€™s not for counsel to make comments about objections.Â  \r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Iâ€™m going to overrule the objection.Â  But Mr. \r\n  Knie, youâ€™re treading on thin ice.\r\n\r\nWe find any error in the trial court \r\n  overruling the Bankâ€™s objection to this testimony harmless.Â  See GTE \r\n  Sprint Communications Corp. v.

Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.: LaQuinces Delvecchio \r\n  Davis appeals his convictions for trafficking in crack cocaine and possession \r\n  of marijuana, arguing the search warrant which led to the discovery of the illegal \r\n  drugs was not based on probable cause and arguing the underlying search warrant \r\n  affidavit was defective because it contained false information and did not include \r\n  allegedly exculpatory information.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn July 13, 2000, Officer Brian Evans of the York \r\n  County Multijurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit received two calls from an \r\n  anonymous informant stating a person known as â€œQâ€ was driving an older model \r\n  Chevrolet, ice-blue or black in color with a broken front grill, and was selling \r\n  crack cocaine in the Green Street area of Rock Hill.Â  The informant provided \r\n  a license plate number for the vehicle. \r\nOfficer Evans recognized the nickname â€œQâ€ as Davisâ€™ \r\n  street name and knew Davis had a prior conviction involving crack cocaine.Â  \r\n  A check of South Carolina motor vehicle records revealed that the vehicle described \r\n  by the informant was registered to Davisâ€™ mother and that the license plate \r\n  was suspended for failure to pay insurance.Â  Officer Evans went to the area \r\n  where the informant indicated Davis was selling drugs, but was unable to locate \r\n  Davis or the vehicle. \r\nThe same informant called again the next day, reporting \r\n  that â€œQâ€ had left the Ramada Inn motel in Rock Hill and was headed to Green \r\n  Street with crack cocaine to sell.Â  In response, police surveilled Green Street \r\n  looking for Davis.Â  They spotted the vehicle described by the informant being \r\n  driven near Green Street, at which time one of the officers turned on his blue \r\n  lights to initiate a traffic stop.Â  The vehicle accelerated, ran a stop sign, \r\n  and attempted to evade the police for several blocks.Â  Davis, the lone occupant, \r\n  jumped from the moving vehicle and ran.Â  The unguided vehicle crashed into two \r\n  parked cars.Â  Shortly thereafter, Davis was apprehended and arrested for failure \r\n  to stop for a blue light.Â  He told police he had run because he had smoked marijuana \r\n  shortly before his arrest. \r\nIn a search of Davis incident to his arrest, the \r\n  police found $156.00 in cash, a pager, and a motel key card.Â  Davis stated the \r\n  motel key card belonged to a motel room in Orangeburg in which he had stayed \r\n  the night before.Â  Davis repeatedly denied the key card belonged to a motel \r\n  room in Rock Hill.Â  Notwithstanding his denials, police confirmed that a â€œQuincy \r\n  Davisâ€ was registered as a guest at the Rock Hill Ramada Inn motel and that \r\n  the key card fit the door of the motel room. \r\nPolice obtained a search warrant for the room from \r\n  the local magistrate based upon the following affidavit, supplemented with oral \r\n  sworn testimony:\r\n\r\nAffidavit for Search Warrant\r\nAttachment #1 Ramada Inn 911 Riverview Rd. Room 227 Rock Hill, \r\n  S.C.\r\nThe affiant, a sworn police officer with the York County Multijurisdictional \r\n  Drug Enforcement Unit, with over 20 years of narcotic experience, states the \r\n  following facts to support probable cause to search the premises listed within.\r\nOn July 13, 2000, Officer Brian Evans of the York County Multijurisdictional \r\n  Drug Enforcement Unit received information that â€œQâ€ was selling crack in the \r\n  Green St. area of Rock Hill.Â  The source stated that â€œQâ€ was in an old ice blue \r\n  or ice black Chevrolet and gave Officer Evans the vehicleâ€™s license number.Â  \r\n  The source stated that â€œQâ€ does not have a driverâ€™s license.Â  The tag came back \r\n  to Rosa Hinton, which is the mother of Quincy Davis.Â  Also the printout indicated \r\n  the tag was suspended.Â  Officers have personal knowledge that Quincy Davis is \r\n  known as â€œQâ€ and has convictions for selling crack.Â  Officer Evans was unable \r\n  to locate the vehicle.\r\nOn July 13, 2000, Officer Evans received a second call that \r\n  â€œQâ€ was back on Green St. in a yard and selling crack.Â  Officer Evans responded \r\n  and was unable to locate Davis.\r\nOn July 14, 2000, Officer Evans received a call from the same \r\n  source that â€œQâ€ was leaving the Ramada Inn in Rock Hill going to Green St. and \r\n  that â€œQâ€ had crack to sell.Â  Officer Evans went to the area and observed the \r\n  vehicle on Lucky Ln. traveling towards Whitgreen St. towards Green St.Â  Officer \r\n  Evans attempted a traffic stop and the vehicle accelerated failing to stop for \r\n  the police blue light.Â  The vehicle drove in a reckless manner speeding and \r\n  failed to stop for stop signs.Â  The driver then jumped from the vehicle while \r\n  moving and the vehicle struck two parked vehicles.Â  The driver fled on foot \r\n  and was caught a short distance away and identified as Quincy Davis.Â  Search \r\n  incident to arrest revealed a Ramada Inn Motel Key Card in Davisâ€™ pants pocket.Â  \r\n  Davis stated that he spent the night in the Ramada Inn in Orangeburg and kept \r\n  the motel key.Â  Officers of the DEU went to the Ramada Inn on Riverview Rd. \r\n  in Rock Hill and the key matched a room registered to Davis.Â  Davis was asked \r\n  to sign a consent form to search the room and Davis denied completely and fully \r\n  that he has a motel room in Rock Hill.Â  Davis was asked 3 times and each time \r\n  he denied having a room.Â  Davis refused to sign the consent stating that it \r\n  is not his room.Â  Davis stated that he ran because he had smoked marijuana.Â  \r\n  Record check revealed in fact that Davis has been convicted of selling crack \r\n  in the past and narcotic officers of the DEU have received information from \r\n  sources recently that Quincy Davis is selling crack in the Rock Hill area.\r\nBased on past narcotic investigations it is common that drug \r\n  dealers secrete contraband and proceeds of drug sales in motel rooms. \r\n\r\nIn a subsequent search of the room, police found \r\n  32.44 grams of crack cocaine, 23.54 grams of marijuana, and drug paraphernalia.Â  \r\n\r\nIn a pretrial suppression hearing, Davis argued \r\n  the evidence found in the motel room should be excluded.Â  Davis asserted the \r\n  only corroborated information was his identity, and under the authority of Florida \r\n  v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), the search was not based upon probable cause. \r\n\r\nThe court denied the motion to suppress, concluding \r\n  the affidavit, as orally supplemented, provided probable cause for the issuance \r\n  of the search warrant.Â  At trial, Davis was convicted of trafficking in crack \r\n  cocaine, failure to stop for a blue light, and possession of marijuana.Â  Davis \r\n  was sentenced to thirty years for trafficking crack cocaine, five years for \r\n  failure to stop for a blue light, and one year for possession of marijuana, \r\n  with the sentences to run concurrently.Â  \r\nDavis appeals his convictions for trafficking in \r\n  crack cocaine and possession of marijuana.Â  In his appeal, Davis makes the same \r\n  argument as he made at the suppression hearing.Â  He also contends the drugs \r\n  should have been suppressed because the affidavit stated the attesting officer \r\n  had personal knowledge of Davisâ€™ prior conviction for selling crack cocaine, \r\n  when in fact, his prior conviction was only for possession of crack cocaine.Â  \r\n  Davis contends the affiantâ€™s personal verification of information later determined \r\n  to be incorrect provides evidence that this false information was intentionally \r\n  or recklessly conveyed to the magistrate, rendering the warrant defective under \r\n  a Franks v. Delaware [1]  analysis.Â  In addition, Davis \r\n  argues the affidavit was defective because it did not inform the magistrate \r\n  of the exculpatory fact that Davis had no drugs in his possession when he was \r\n  arrested, contrary to the assertions of the informant.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.)\r\n       Did the magistrate err \r\n  in issuing the search warrant because it was not based on probable cause to \r\n  believe contraband would be found in the motel room?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.)&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n  Was the incorrect information concerning Davisâ€™ prior criminal record intentionally \r\n  or recklessly presented to the magistrate, rendering the search warrant defective?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       3.)&nbsp;\r\n       Did the omission of the fact that no drugs were found in Davisâ€™ possession \r\n  at the time of arrest constitute exculpatory information that was intentionally \r\n  or recklessly withheld from the magistrate, rendering the search warrant defective?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe duty of a reviewing court is to \r\n  decide whether â€œthe magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable \r\n  cause existed.â€ Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983) (internal \r\n  quotations omitted); State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 144, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  347, 349 (1999) (adopting the Gates standard of review).Â  â€œA reviewing \r\n  court should give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable \r\n  cause.â€ State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 290, 494 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1997); \r\n  see Gates, 462 U.S. at 236 (holding the Fourth Amendment evidences \r\n  a â€œstrong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrantâ€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Totality of \r\n  the Circumstances\r\nDavis argues the magistrate should not have issued the search \r\n  warrant because it was not based on probable cause.Â  We disagree.\r\nA magistrate may issue a warrant only upon a finding of probable \r\n  cause. Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 143, 519 S.E.2d at 348.Â  A probable cause \r\n  determination requires the magistrate to analyze the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  meaning he should â€œmake a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all \r\n  the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, . . . there is a fair \r\n  probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular \r\n  place.â€Â  Gates, 462 U.S. at 238; see State v. Johnson, \r\n  302 S.C. 243, 247-48, 395 S.E.2d 167, 169 (1990) (adopting the Gates \r\n  totality-of-circumstances test); State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 338-39, \r\n  372 S.E.2d 587, 588-89 (1988) (holding the magistrate should determine probable \r\n  cause based on all the information available to him at the time the warrant \r\n  is issued, including sworn oral testimony); State v. Adams, 291 S.C. \r\n  132, 133-34, 352 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1987) (â€œA determination of probable cause \r\n  depends upon the totality of the circumstances.â€).\r\nIn this case, a police officer received three phone calls \r\n  over a two-day period from an anonymous informant stating that Davis was selling \r\n  illegal drugs.Â  In each of the phone calls, the informant referred to the suspect \r\n  as â€œQ.â€Â  The officer knew from personal knowledge that Davis was known by the \r\n  street name â€œQâ€ and that Davis had a drug-related conviction.Â  Thus, the informantâ€™s \r\n  information was corroborated by the knowledge and prior experience of the police \r\n  officer. See United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 583 (1971) \r\n  (holding â€œa policemanâ€™s knowledge of a suspectâ€™s reputation . . . is . . . a \r\n  â€˜practical consideration of everyday lifeâ€™ upon which an officer (or a magistrate) \r\n  may properly relyâ€ (single quotation marks and parentheses as in original)); \r\n  cf. State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 459, 462 S.E.2d 279, 282 (1995) \r\n  (â€œThe â€˜experience of a police officer is a factor to be considered in the determination \r\n  of probable cause.â€™â€ (quoting United States v. Fisher, 702 F.2d 372, \r\n  378 (2d Cir. 1983))).Â  \r\nThe informant also stated Davis was driving a late model \r\n  Chevrolet, ice blue or black in color, with a broken front grill.Â  The description \r\n  included the license plate number.Â  By checking the license plate number provided, \r\n  the police independently verified that Davisâ€™ mother owned a vehicle fitting \r\n  the description given by the informant, further corroborating the informantâ€™s \r\n  information. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 244 (â€œBecause an informant \r\n  is right about some things, he is more probably right about other facts, including \r\n  the claim regarding . . . illegal activity.â€ (internal quotation marks and internal \r\n  citation omitted)).Â  \r\nIt is true that this corroboration only verified the identity \r\n  of â€œQâ€ and his otherwise legal activity of driving an ice blue or black Chevrolet.Â  \r\n  Absent further information, we agree the analysis in Florida v. J.L., \r\n  529 U.S. 266 (2000), would be implicated.Â  In J.L., the police received \r\n  an anonymous tip that a suspect fitting a certain description would be standing \r\n  at a certain location and would be in possession of a firearm. Id. at \r\n  271.Â  After verifying the suspectâ€™s description and location, the police approached \r\n  the suspect and frisked him. Id. at 268.Â  The frisk was held to have \r\n  violated the suspectâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights because the tip was not â€œreliable \r\n  in its assertion of illegality,â€ and the police had no basis for the frisk other \r\n  than the tip.Â  Id. at 271-72.Â  However, in contrast to J.L., the \r\n  independent investigation by police in this case revealed the vehicleâ€™s license \r\n  plate was suspended for failure to pay insurance.Â  This provided a basis for \r\n  a traffic stop once the police observed Davis driving the vehicle.Â  Thus, J.L. \r\n  is not controlling.\r\nShortly before police stopped Davis for driving with a suspended \r\n  license plate, the informant made his last phone call to police in which he \r\n  stated that Davis had left a Rock Hill Ramada Inn motel room and was headed \r\n  to Green Street with drugs to sell.Â  According to the affidavit, the attesting \r\n  officer was a twenty-year veteran of the narcotics unit who knew from his experience \r\n  that drugs and proceeds of drug sales are often kept in motel rooms.Â  Notwithstanding \r\n  Davisâ€™ argument to the contrary, the law is well settled that the officerâ€™s \r\n  knowledge of general trends in criminal behavior is a relevant consideration \r\n  in determining probable cause. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 243 (holding \r\n  defendantâ€™s trip to Florida provided part of the basis for probable cause to \r\n  issue a warrant to search defendantâ€™s vehicle and house for drugs because police \r\n  work has shown that â€œFlorida is well-known as a source of narcotics and other \r\n  illegal drugsâ€).\r\nWhen a police officer observed Davis driving the vehicle \r\n  with the suspended license plate towards the area where the informant stated \r\n  Davis intended to sell drugs, the officer initiated a traffic stop.Â  Based upon \r\n  the status of the vehicleâ€™s suspended license plate this stop was proper, a \r\n  point not contested by Davis in this appeal.Â  After the officer turned on his \r\n  blue lights, Davis tried to evade police by accelerating, running through a \r\n  stop sign, jumping and running from the moving vehicle.Â  After being arrested \r\n  for failure to stop for a blue light, Davis admitted he ran from police because \r\n  he had smoked marijuana earlier in the day.Â  This information was imparted to \r\n  the magistrate, and under well-settled law allows a reasonable inference of \r\n  guilty conduct. See State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 200, 470 \r\n  S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (holding defendantâ€™s flight from police was â€œat least \r\n  some evidence of guiltâ€).Â  \r\nIn the search of Davis incident to his arrest, police found \r\n  a Ramada Inn motel key card in Davisâ€™ pocket which he denied opened a room in \r\n  the Rock Hill Ramada Inn.Â  Davis repeatedly denied the key card belonged to \r\n  the Rock Hill motel room, even after he was told the key card fit the door of \r\n  the Rock Hill motel room.Â  The independent verification of the identity of the \r\n  key card further corroborated the informantâ€™s information, and Davisâ€™ subterfuge \r\n  provided a reasonable inference that something was located in the room which \r\n  he did not want police to discover. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 241 \r\n  (â€œOur decisions applying the totality of the circumstances analysis . . . have \r\n  consistently recognized the value of corroboration of details of an informantâ€™s \r\n  tip by independent police work.â€); cf. State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. \r\n  323, 333, 457 S.E.2d 616, 622 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding defendantâ€™s suspicious \r\n  activity was part of the basis for finding that probable cause existed for a \r\n  search).Â  \r\nThe magistrate based his decision to issue the warrant to \r\n  search the motel room on the affidavit and oral sworn testimony of the officer \r\n  which detailed the information provided by the informant, the police work conducted \r\n  as a result of the informantâ€™s tips, the personal knowledge of the police officer, \r\n  the fact that Davis engaged in the independent illegal act of driving a vehicle \r\n  with a suspended license plate, and the suspicious conduct engaged in by Davis.Â  \r\n  Thus, the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed. \r\n  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 241-46 (upholding the issuance of a warrant \r\n  to search for drugs based on an anonymous letter that outlined detailed travel \r\n  plans of husband and wife, police corroboration of the coupleâ€™s activities, \r\n  and informantâ€™s allegation that couple was engaged in drug trafficking); cf. \r\n  State v. McLaughlin, 307 S.C. 19, 22, 413 S.E.2d 819, 821 (1992) (holding \r\n  probable cause to search a toolbox was established by defendantâ€™s suspicious \r\n  behavior, his possession of large amounts of cash, the presence of a marijuana \r\n  cigarette, and his repeated denials of ownership of the toolbox).\r\nII. Veracity of \r\n  the Warrant Affidavit\r\nDavis next argues the magistrate should not have issued the \r\n  search warrant because the warrant affidavit included false information and \r\n  omitted exculpatory information.Â  We conclude these arguments are not preserved \r\n  for review.\r\nâ€œIn Franks v. Delaware, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court held that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments gave a defendant \r\n  the right in certain circumstances to challenge the veracity of a warrant affidavit \r\n  after the warrant had been issued and executed.â€ State v. Missouri, 337 \r\n  S.C. 548, 553, 524 S.E.2d 394, 396 (1999).\r\nFranks outlined a two-part test for challenging \r\n  the warrant affidavitâ€™s veracity. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 \r\n  (1978).Â  First, to mandate an evidentiary hearing, there must be â€œallegations \r\n  of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth [as to statements \r\n  included in the warrant affidavit], and those allegations must be accompanied \r\n  by an offer of proof.â€ Id. at 171.Â  At the hearing, the defendant has \r\n  the burden of proving the allegations of perjury or reckless disregard for the \r\n  truth by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at 155-56; see State \r\n  v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 126-27, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2000) (holding a defendant \r\n  is entitled to challenge misstatements in a warrant affidavit if the following \r\n  criteria are met: â€œ(1) the defendantâ€™s attack is more than conclusory and is \r\n  supported by more than a mere desire to cross-examine; (2) the defendant makes \r\n  allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth which \r\n  are accompanied by an offer of proof; and, (3) the affiant has made the allegedly \r\n  false or reckless statementâ€).Â  \r\nSecond, if the deliberate falsehood or reckless \r\n  disregard for the truth has been established, the court must consider the affidavitâ€™s \r\n  remaining content, with the affidavitâ€™s false material set to one side, to determine \r\n  if it is sufficient to establish probable cause.Â  If the court determines probable \r\n  cause does not exist after the false material is omitted from the analysis, \r\n  â€œthe search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to \r\n  the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.â€ \r\n  Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56; see Missouri, 337 S.C. at 553-54, \r\n  524 S.E.2d at 396-97 (adopting the two-prong Franks test).\r\nAlthough Franks addressed an instance in \r\n  which false information had been included in the warrant affidavit, the Franks \r\n  test also applies in an instance in which exculpatory material is left out of \r\n  the warrant. Missouri, 337 S.C. at 554, 524 S.E.2d at 397.\r\nTo be entitled to a Franks hearing for an alleged \r\n  omission, the challenger must make a preliminary showing that the information \r\n  in question was omitted with the intent to make, or in reckless disregard of \r\n  whether it made, the affidavit misleading to the issuing judge.Â  There will \r\n  be no Franks violation if the affidavit, including the omitted data, \r\n  still contains sufficient information to establish probable cause. \r\nId.\r\nIn this case, Davis filed a written memorandum \r\n  prior to trial arguing for suppression solely on the grounds that the information \r\n  concerning illegal conduct provided by the anonymous informant was not corroborated \r\n  and, thus, probable cause for the search was not established.Â  The written memorandum \r\n  did not assert that false information was intentionally or recklessly included \r\n  in the affidavit, nor did it argue that exculpatory information was intentionally \r\n  or recklessly omitted.Â  At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, Davis \r\n  relied upon his written memorandum, without elaboration, to support his motion.Â  \r\n  Consequently, the trial court was not presented with either issue. Â Furthermore, \r\n  the trial court made no ruling with respect thereto.Â  Therefore, we decline \r\n  to rule upon these issues. See State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, \r\n  393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (holding â€œ[a] contemporaneous objection is required \r\n  to properly preserve an error for appellate reviewâ€ and an â€œissue which is not \r\n  properly preserved cannot be raised for the first time on appealâ€); Dickman, \r\n  341 S.C. at 295, 534 S.E.2d at 269 (holding a party cannot argue one ground \r\n  below and then argue another ground on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  Davisâ€™ convictions for trafficking in crack cocaine and possession of marijuana \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  438 U.S. 154 (1978).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
