Â The land in\r\n  question is a peninsula-like tract formed by the confluence of two tidal\r\n  creeks.Â  The land is divided into six parcels whose zoning is governed by the\r\n  ZLDR.Â  Under the ZLDR, five of the parcels were zoned Agricultural Residential\r\n  (AGR).Â  The ZLDR provides that base zoning district AGR parcels have a maximum\r\n  recommended density for residential use of one dwelling unit per acre.Â  The\r\n  last parcel was zoned Agricultural Preservation (AG-10), which provides for a\r\n  recommended density of one dwelling unit per ten acres.Â  In order to achieve\r\n  the highest allowed density of one dwelling unit per five acres, an application\r\n  must be processed through the planned development process. Â Without\r\n  application for maximum density, the original zoning plan allowed for the\r\n  development of approximately sixty-four units.  \r\nOn December 17, 2003, Appellants filed a Zoning Change Application\r\n  requesting the land in question be rezoned as a planned development that would\r\n  include single family homes. Â The permitted uses of the planned\r\n  development would include detached single family homes on lots having at least\r\n  one acre; agriculture; horse or other animal production; commercial timber\r\n  operations; and stables.Â  The application stated that the new planned\r\n  development would shift the number of units within the tracts of Peterâ€™s Point\r\n  and would allow more units in the previously zoned AG-10 tract.Â  The application\r\n  proposed to reduce the total number of dwelling units from sixty-four to\r\n  fifty-five and reduce the total number of waterfront lots to fifty-one.Â  \r\n \r\nOn June 22, 2004, the Charleston County Council (County Council) adopted\r\n  Ordinance No. 1300, which rezoned the land in question pursuant to Article 3.5\r\n  of the ZLDR from AGR/AG-10 districts to a planned development district.Â  This\r\n  change reduced the overall number of units allowed, but reallocated them,\r\n  increasing the number of dwelling units in the AG-10 area from ten to\r\n  thirty-nine units.Â  On July 1, 2004, adjoining property owners and distant\r\n  cousins of Appellants (hereinafter â€œRespondentsâ€) filed a Complaint against Appellants\r\n  stating that the rezoning violated the ZLDR by increasing the density ratio of\r\n  the previously zoned AG-10 area from a density ratio of one dwelling per ten\r\n  acres to one dwelling per 2.73 acres.Â  Both parties filed motions for summary\r\n  judgment.  \r\nAlthough the parties raised several issues during the summary\r\n  judgment hearing, the master limited his analysis by stating, â€œ[t]he issue in\r\n  this case turns on the construction of various provisions of the ZLDR,\r\n  particularly those of Article 4.5.3, the AG-10 regulations, and those of\r\n  Article 3.5, the planned development regulations, in a manner that effectuates\r\n  the intent of County Council.â€Â  After analyzing this issue, the master\r\n  ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents.Â   \r\nIn reaching this decision, the master found Ordinance No. 1300\r\n  conflicted with Article 4.5.3B of the ZLDR which limits the density in an AG-10\r\n  district to no higher than one residential dwelling unit per five acres.Â  The\r\n  master rejected Appellantsâ€™ contention that Article 3.5 of the ZLDR, which\r\n  states that planned developments may provide for variations from other\r\n  ordinances concerning the density of a parcel, was controlling.Â  The master\r\n  reasoned that Article 4.5.3.B, the more specific ZLDR provision, took\r\n  precedence over the more general provisions of Article 3.5.Â  In support of this\r\n  reasoning, the master relied on what he believed was the intent of County Council\r\n  in adopting the ZLDR.Â  Specifically, the master found that by enacting the\r\n  AG-10 and AG-8 regulations, â€œCouncil evinced an intent to limit itself in\r\n  increasing density in these districts, by requiring a planned development and\r\n  then capping the number of units that could be achieved by way thereof.â€\r\nBased on this analysis, the master held that because the planned\r\n  development was adopted contrary to the ZLDR, it was arbitrary, capricious and\r\n  exceeded the authority of the County Council.Â  The master also concluded there was\r\n  insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether or not the planned\r\n  development met the criteria for creating a planned development contained in\r\n  the ZLDR.Â  As a result, the master remanded the matter to County Council to\r\n  make specific findings and for the identification and designation of the open\r\n  space and other criteria necessary for the establishment of a planned\r\n  development.Â  The master subsequently denied Appellantsâ€™ motion for reconsideration.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which states\r\n  that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334,\r\n  340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005); Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities,\r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party below. Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146,\r\n  151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004); see Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C.\r\n  310, 317, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be\r\n  construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment\r\n  is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Gadson v. Hembree, 364\r\n  S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005). Â â€œEven when there is no dispute as\r\n  to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn\r\n  from them, summary judgment should be denied.â€ Nelson\r\n    v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605\r\n  S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œHowever, when plain, palpable, and\r\n  indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.â€Â  Ellis v. Davidson,\r\n  358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the master erred in voiding the planned development by finding a conflict\r\n  between Ordinance No. 1300 and the ZLDR.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nâ€œIt\r\n  is well settled that when interpreting an ordinance, legislative intent must\r\n  prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used.â€Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C.\r\n  65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).Â  â€œIn construing ordinances, the terms must\r\n  be taken in their ordinary and popular meaning.â€Â  Id. at 68, 459 S.E.2d\r\n  at 843.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intent of the legislature.â€Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v.\r\n    Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  â€œThe first question\r\n  of statutory interpretation is whether the statuteâ€™s meaning is clear on its\r\n  face.â€Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588\r\n  (2002).Â  Â If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear\r\n  meaning, then â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court\r\n  has no right to impose another meaning.â€ Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79,\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their\r\n  plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction\r\n  to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation. Hitachi Data Sys. Corp.\r\n    v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  A statute should be given a reasonable and practical construction\r\n  consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the statute.Â  Daisy\r\n    Outdoor Adver. Co. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 352 S.C. 113, 120, 572 S.E.2d\r\n  462, 466 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\nâ€œRezoning is a\r\n  legislative matter, and the court has no power to zone property.â€Â  Bear\r\n    Enters. v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C. 137, 140, 459 S.E.2d 883, 885 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995). â€œThe decision of the legislative body is presumptively valid, and\r\n  the property owner has the burden of proving otherwise.â€ Â Id.Â  Our\r\n  supreme court has explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe authority of a municipality to enact zoning ordinances,\r\n  restricting the use of privately owned\r\n  property is founded in the police power. The governing bodies of municipalities\r\n  clothed with authority to determine residential and industrial districts are\r\n  better qualified by their knowledge of the situation to act upon such matters than\r\n  are the Courts, and they will not be interfered with in the exercise of their\r\n  police power to accomplish desired end unless there is plain violation of the\r\n  constitutional rights of citizens. Â There is a strong presumption in favor of\r\n  the validity of municipal zoning ordinances, and in favor of the validity of\r\n  their application, and where the Planning and Zoning Commission and the city\r\n  council of a municipality have acted after considering all of the facts, the\r\n  Court should not disturb the finding unless such action is arbitrary,\r\n  unreasonable, or in obvious abuse of its discretion, or unless it has acted\r\n  illegally and in excess of its lawfully delegated authority. Â Likewise, the\r\n  power to declare an ordinance invalid because it is so unreasonable as to impair\r\n  or destroy constitutional rights is one which will be exercised carefully and\r\n  cautiously, as it is not the function of the Court to pass upon the wisdom or\r\n  expediency of municipal ordinances or regulations. The burden of proving the\r\n  invalidity of a zoning ordinance is on the party attacking it to establish that\r\n  the acts of the city council were arbitrary, unreasonable and unjust. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nRush v. City of Greenville, 246 S.C. 268, 276, 143\r\n  S.E.2d 527, 530-31 (1965).Â  Accordingly, â€œ[t]he Court will not overturn the\r\n  action of [county council] if the decision is fairly debateable because the\r\n  [countyâ€™s] action is presumed to have been a valid exercise of power and it is\r\n  not the prerogative of the Court to pass upon the wisdom of the decision.â€Â  Rushing\r\n    v. City of Greenville, 265 S.C. 285, 288, 217 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1975); Lenardis\r\n      v. City of Greenville, 316 S.C. 471, 472, 450 S.E.2d 597, 598 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994).  \r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of this case, we believe County Councilâ€™s decision to adopt Ordinance\r\n  No. 1300 was â€œfairly debatableâ€ and did not constitute an action that was\r\n  arbitrary, unreasonable, or unjust.Â  First, without question, County Council\r\n  was authorized to adopt the planned development ordinance.Â  Section 6-29-740 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code permits â€œthe local governing authority [to] provide for\r\n  the establishment of planned development districts as amendments to a locally\r\n  adopted zoning ordinance and official zoning map.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-740 (2004).Â \r\n  Moreover, Article 2.1.2 of the ZLDR states that County Council shall have final\r\n  decision-making authority on matters concerning planned developments, including\r\n  zoning map amendments.Â  Thus, these provisions provide County Council with final\r\n  decision-making authority in rezoning actions pursuant to a planned development\r\n  application such as in the instant case. Â Accordingly, we find the\r\n  master erred in ruling that â€œ[i]n approving Ordinance 1300, the Council\r\n  exceeded the authority devolved upon it by its own laws.â€Â   \r\nCounty\r\n  Councilâ€™s decision to adopt Ordinance No. 1300 was not only authorized, it was\r\n  supported by the portion of the ZLDR pertaining to planned developments.Â  Planned\r\n  developments are governed by Article 3.5 of the ZLDR, and Article 3.5.1 defines\r\n  a planned development as a â€œtype of zoning district (PD) and a type of\r\n  development plan.â€Â  As stated in Article 3.5.2A, the planned development\r\n  regulations are â€œintended to encourage innovative land planning and site\r\n  designâ€ by â€œ[r]educing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results\r\n  from strict application of zoning standards that were designated primarily for\r\n  development on individual lots.â€Â  More importantly, Article 3.5.7 specifically\r\n  provides for deviations from other zoning designations:Â   \r\n\r\n\tPlanned\r\n  Developments may provide for variations from other ordinances and the\r\n  regulations of other established zoning districts concerning use, setbacks, lot\r\n  area, density, bulk and other requirements to accommodate flexibility in\r\n  the arrangement of uses for the general purpose of promoting and protecting the\r\n  public health, safety, and general welfare.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-740 (2004) (outlining planned development districts).[3] Â Article 3.5.7 goes on to outline criteria that must be met for a proposed\r\n  development that is applying for a higher density than allowed by the base\r\n  zoning district.Â  As evidenced by the outlined ZLDR provisions and section\r\n  6-29-740, planned developments are intended to provide flexibility for County\r\n  Council to exercise its discretion in addressing requirements in base zoning\r\n  districts, in this case a density requirement.Â   \r\nAlthough\r\n  Article 4.5.3B, the ZLDR section pertaining to AG-10 properties, states that\r\n  â€œIn order to achieve the highest allowed density of 1 dwelling unit per 5\r\n  acres, a request must be processed through the Planned Development process as\r\n  designated in Art. 3.5 of this Ordinance,â€ the planned development section of\r\n  the ZLDR, i.e., Article 3.5, allows for a greater maximum density than\r\n  one dwelling unit per five acres by specifically providing for variations in\r\n  density from other ordinances and the regulations of other established base zoning\r\n  districts.Â  Accordingly, we do not agree with the master that a conflict exists\r\n  between the two ZLDR provisions.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  there is nothing to suggest that County Council cannot change an ordinance that\r\n  it created. Â To the contrary, section 6-29-760 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  allows for the enactment or amendment of any zoning regulation or map.Â  This\r\n  section authorizes municipalities to amend such regulations, restrictions, and\r\n  boundaries.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-760 (2004) (outlining procedure\r\n  for enactment or amendment of zoning regulation or map).Â  Hence, a municipality\r\n  has the legislative power to amend its general zoning ordinance and rezone small\r\n  areas, so long as its action is not arbitrary or unreasonable.Â  See Bob\r\n    Jones Univ., Inc. v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351, 360, 133 S.E.2d 843,\r\n  847 (1963) (â€œA municipal zoning ordinance is presumably valid.Â  Hence, the\r\n  burden of proof is upon the party attacking the amendment to establish that the\r\n  acts of the city council were arbitrary, unreasonable and unjust.â€)(citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Because County Councilâ€™s actions were authorized and its decision to\r\n  adopt Ordinance No. 1300, which rezoned the six-parcel, multiple zoning\r\n  districts of Peterâ€™s Point Plantation, was at least â€œfairly debateable,â€ we\r\n  hold the master erred in voiding the ordinance.Â  Â Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  masterâ€™s decision and reinstate Ordinance No. 1300.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the\r\n  masterâ€™s decision is  \r\nREVERSED.[4]\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Â Â Although Charleston County and the members of its\r\n  council are listed in the caption on appeal, we note they were dismissed as\r\n  parties by order of this court pursuant to their motion to withdraw their\r\n  appeal.\r\n[2] Â This case was originally scheduled for oral\r\n  argument.Â  The parties, however, consented to a request by this court to have\r\n  the case submitted on the record.\r\n[3]Â Â  Section 6-29-740 provides:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  order to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive plan of the locality and\r\n  to allow flexibility in development that will result in improved design,\r\n  character, and quality of new mixed use developments and preserve natural and\r\n  scenic features of open spaces, the local governing authority may provide for\r\n  the establishment of planned development districts as amendments to a locally\r\n  adopted zoning ordinance and official zoning map. Â The adopted planned\r\n  development map is the zoning district map for the property. Â The planned\r\n  development provisions must encourage innovative site planning for residential,\r\n  commercial, institutional, and industrial developments within planned\r\n  development districts. Â Planned development districts may provide for variations from other ordinances and the regulations of other\r\n  established zoning districts concerning use, setbacks, lot size, density, bulk,\r\n  and other requirements to accommodate flexibility in the arrangement of uses\r\n  for the general purpose of promoting and protecting the public health, safety,\r\n  and general welfare. Â Amendments to a planned development district may be\r\n  authorized by ordinance of the governing authority after recommendation from\r\n  the planning commission. Â These amendments constitute zoning ordinance\r\n  amendments and must follow prescribed procedures for the amendments. Â The\r\n  adopted plan may include a method for minor modifications to the site plan or\r\n  development provisions.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann.

Ct. filed Dec. 12, 1996).Â  Brown then filed for post-conviction relief in December 1996 and\r\n  amended the application in June 2003.Â  An evidentiary hearing was held in\r\n  September 2003 in Darlington County.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Brown argued his counsel was ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s questions about and references to his failure\r\n  to provide a statement to police.Â  Specifically, Brown averred the solicitor\r\n  made numerous comments that constituted Doyle violations.Â  During cross-examination,\r\n  the solicitor stated:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œEverybody else gave the police a statement the next morning at\r\n  nine oâ€™clock.â€\r\n\tâ€œAnd during all that time, some ten months, you havenâ€™t given [the\r\n  police] a statement, have you?â€\r\n\tâ€œAnd when you came in at 3:00 in the morning you didnâ€™t call the\r\n  police and tell them Eric David had shot somebody, did you?â€\r\n\tâ€œYou didnâ€™t call the police and tell them Eric David had a gun,\r\n  did you?â€\r\n\r\nBrown contended the solicitor committed a Doyle violation\r\n  with the following comment made during closing argument:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œHe hasnâ€™t given a statement.Â  He hasnâ€™t given a statement because\r\n  he is guilty.â€\r\n\r\nIn response to Brown alleging ineffective assistance, trial\r\n  counsel testified that it is fairly typical for solicitors to ask on\r\n  cross-examination why the defendant didnâ€™t take particular actions if\r\n  innocent.Â  Counsel opined Brownâ€™s failure to make a statement did not affect\r\n  the outcome of the trial.Â  In light of the numerous eyewitnesses who gave\r\n  statements to police and testified at trial, counsel explained his strategy was\r\n  to draw the jurorsâ€™ attention to the discrepancies amongst the witnessesâ€™\r\n  stories.Â  Counsel stated that he typically does not object during closing\r\n  argument for fear of creating a negative impression with the jury.\r\nIn denying post-conviction relief, the PCR judge found there was\r\n  â€œoverwhelming evidence in the case for conviction of [Brown].â€Â  Further, the\r\n  judge held â€œthat even if there were a failure to object to certain testimony,\r\n  that [Brown] has failed to establish prejudice in this matter.â€Â  The PCR judge\r\n  found that trial counsel â€œarticulated valid strategic reasons for deciding not\r\n  to object to portions of the solicitor[â€™]s examination and of his closing\r\n  argument.Â  [Brown] has not shown that counsel was deficient in that choice of\r\n  tactics.â€\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR judge err in not finding trial counsel ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to a Doyle violation at trial?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Edwards v. State, 372 S.C. 493, 494, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  738, 739 (2007); Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000).Â \r\n  â€œ[P]etitioner must meet the standard established in Strickland v. Washington,\r\n  466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).â€Â  State v. Edmond, 341 S.C. 340, 346, 534 S.E.2d 682, 685 (2006).Â  To establish a claim\r\n  of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove: (1) that counsel\r\n  failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms;\r\n  and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the applicant's case. Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\r\nâ€œCounsel\r\n  is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all\r\n  significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.â€Â  Strickland,\r\n  466 U.S. at 690; Morris v. State, 371 S.C. 278, 639 S.E.2d 53 (2006); Cherry\r\n    v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Â The burden is on the\r\n  applicant in a post-conviction proceeding to prove the allegations in his\r\n  application.Â  Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP; Van Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598,\r\n  603, 602 S.E.2d 738, 741 (2004); Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441,\r\n  334 S.E.2d 813 (1985). Â â€œTo\r\n  establish a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, a PCR applicant\r\n  has the burden of proving counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective\r\n  standard of reasonableness and, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that the result at trial would have been differentâ€¦.â€ Johnson v.\r\n    State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997); Underwood v. State,\r\n  309 S.C. 560, 425 S.E.2d 20 (1992); Simmons v. State, 308 S.C. 481, 419\r\n  S.E.2d 225 (1992).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\r\n  undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).Â  â€œFurthermore,\r\n  when a defendantâ€™s conviction is challenged, â€˜the question is whether there is\r\n  a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the fact finder would have\r\n  had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.â€™â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318,\r\n  331, 642 S.E2d 590, 596 (2007) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€ Marlar v. State, 373 S.C. 275,\r\n  279, 644 S.E.2d 769, 771 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Dempsey v. State, 363\r\n  S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005)); McCray v. State, 317 S.C.\r\n  557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995).Â  An appellate court must affirm the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  decision when its findings are supported by any evidence of probative value.Â  Custodio\r\n    v. State, 373 S.C. 4, 9, 644 S.E.2d 36, 38 (2007); Cherry v. State,\r\n  300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  However, an appellate court will not\r\n  affirm the decision when it is not supported by any probative evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Edmond, 341 S.C. 340, 347, 534 S.E.2d 682, 686 (2006); Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrown argues the PCR judge erred in not finding trial counsel ineffective\r\n  for failing to object to comments made by the solicitor that Brown never gave\r\n  the police a statement.Â  Specifically, Brown contends the solicitorâ€™s line of\r\n  questioning and comments on his silence violated his constitutional rights\r\n  under Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976).\r\nI.&nbsp; DOYLE v. OHIO\r\nIn Doyle, the Supreme Court held â€œthe use for impeachment\r\n  purposes of [a defendantâ€™s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, violate[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.â€ Doyle,\r\n  426 U.S. at 619.Â  In that case, the defendants received Miranda warnings\r\n  when they were arrested for selling marijuana.Â  They made no statements to the\r\n  police.Â  At their separate trials, the defendants testified, for the first time,\r\n  about their innocence explaining they had been framed by a government informant.Â \r\n  The State then attempted to impeach the defendantsâ€™ credibility on cross-examination\r\n  by questioning them about their post-arrest silence.Â  The State did not suggest\r\n  that the evidence was admissible as evidence of guilt, but asserted the jury\r\n  needed all relevant evidence surrounding the truthfulness of the defendantsâ€™\r\n  exculpatory statements.Â  Doyle, 426 U.S. at 617.Â   \r\nThe Court held â€œthe Miranda decision compels rejection of\r\n  the Stateâ€™s position.â€Â  Id. at 617. Â The Court elucidated:  \r\n\r\n\tâ€˜[W]hen a person is informed, as Miranda requires, that he\r\n  may remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him, â€¦ it does not\r\n  comport with due process to permit the prosecution during the trial to call\r\n  attention to his silence at the time of arrest and to insist that because he\r\n  did not speak about the facts of the case at that time, as he was told he need\r\n  not do, an unfavorable inference might be drawn as to the truth of his trial\r\n  testimony.â€™Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 619 (quoting United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171, 182-183 (1975)).Â  The Court explained that Miranda warnings convey an\r\n  implicit assurance to an arrested person that he will not be penalized for\r\n  remaining silent, thus, â€œit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of\r\n  due process to allow the arrested personâ€™s silence to be used to impeach an\r\n  explanation subsequently offered at trial.â€Â  Â Id. at 618.Â   \r\nIn Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231 (1980), the Supreme\r\n  Court addressed impeachment using pre-arrest silence.Â  The Court distinguished\r\n  the case from Doyle noting this defendant had not yet received the Miranda warnings. â€œIn this case, no governmental action induced the petitioner to\r\n  remain silent before arrest.â€Â  Id. at 240.Â  The defendant stabbed and\r\n  killed a man, but he was not taken into custody until he turned himself in two\r\n  weeks later.Â  After testifying at his murder trial that the stabbing was in\r\n  self-defense, the prosecutor sought to impeach the defendant by asking whether\r\n  he reported the incident to the police prior to his arrest.Â  In his closing\r\n  argument, the prosecutor again made reference to the pre-arrest silence.Â  The defendant\r\n  was found guilty of manslaughter.\r\nThe Court held the use of pre-arrest silence did not deny due\r\n  process and explained:\r\n\r\n\tIn this case, no governmental action induced petitioner to remain\r\n  silent before arrest.Â  The failure to speak occurred before the petitioner was\r\n  taken into custody and given Miranda warnings.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  fundamental unfairness present in Doyle is not present in this case.Â  We\r\n  hold that prearrest silence does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nId. at 240.Â  Additionally, the Court noted:\r\n\r\n\tCommon law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by\r\n  their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact\r\n  naturally would have been asserted.Â  3A J. Wigmore, Evidence Â§ 1042, p. 1056\r\n  (Chadbourn rev. 1970).Â  Each jurisdiction may formulate its own rules of\r\n  evidence to determine when prior silence is so inconsistent with present\r\n  statements that impeachment by reference to such silence is probative. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 239.Â   \r\nDoyle and its progeny have thus made clear that it is the breach of the implied\r\n  assurance contained in the Miranda warnings that violates the\r\n  fundamental fairness required by the Due Process Clause.Â  Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284, 291 (1986).Â  \r\n \r\nIn Wainwright, the defendant appealed a conviction for\r\n  sexual battery.Â  He was arrested two hours after the crime, and he was read the Miranda warnings three times.Â  He repeatedly stated that he understood\r\n  his rights and that he wanted to speak with an attorney before making any\r\n  statement.Â  In his closing argument, the prosecutor suggested these repeated\r\n  refusals were inconsistent with his insanity defense.Â   \r\nThe Court held use of the respondentâ€™s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence was a violation of due process under Doyle.Â  â€œThe point of the Doyle holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that\r\n  his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise\r\n  by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.â€Â  Wainwright, 474 U.S. at 292. Cf. Roberts v. United States, 445 U.S. 552, 561 (1980) (holding\r\n  that postconviction, presentencing silence does not resemble postarrest silence\r\n  induced by assurances in Miranda warnings); Greer v. Miller, 483\r\n  U.S. 756, 763 (1987) (cross-examination concerning\r\n  inconsistent postarrest, post-Miranda statements â€œmakes no unfair use of\r\n  silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving Miranda warnings has not been induced to remain silentâ€) (quoting Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404, 407-408 (1980)). \r\n \r\nThe courts of South Carolina have consistently recognized the\r\n  significance of Doyle on post-arrest silence.Â  Moreover, our supreme court and appellate court have warned\r\n  solicitors against violation of the Doyle prohibition.Â  State v.\r\n    Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 258-259, 391 S.E.2d 551, 555 (1990); State v.\r\n      Arther, 290 S.C. 291, 350 S.E.2d 187 (1990); State v. Holliday, 333\r\n  S.C. 332, 509 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1998); State v. Gray, 304 S.C. 482,\r\n  405 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\nIn State v. Smith, 290 S.C. 393, 350 S.E.2d 923 (1986), our\r\n  supreme court granted certiorari to determine if a defendant convicted\r\n  of murder and assault and battery with intent to kill was denied due process.Â  The\r\n  defendant relied on an insanity defense and provided psychiatric testimony that\r\n  he was insane at the time of the crime.Â  Upon cross-examination, the prosecutor\r\n  asked the psychiatrist if he was aware of the defendantâ€™s refusal to make a\r\n  statement to police.Â  Defense counsel objected before the psychiatrist\r\n  answered, but the trial court did not give a curative instruction.Â  Our supreme\r\n  court reversed the defendantâ€™s conviction and enunciated:\r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  accused has the right to remain silent and the exercise of that right cannot be\r\n  used against him. The State cannot, through evidence or the solicitor's\r\n  argument, comment on the accused's exercise of his right to\r\n\tremain\r\n  silent.Â  State v. Woods, 282 S.C. 18, 316 S.E.2d 673 (1984). See also,\r\n\tDoyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).

Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 339 S.E.2d 692\r\n  (1986).Â  State v. Sloan, 278 S.C. 435, 298 S.E.2d 92 (1982). \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 394-95, 350\r\n  S.E.2d at 924.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Gray, 304 S.C. 482, 405 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991), this court found a\r\n  defendant had been denied due process by the prosecutorâ€™s efforts to impeach\r\n  with post-arrest, post-Miranda silence.Â  In this assault with intent to\r\n  commit criminal sexual conduct trial, Gray did not give any statement to the\r\n  police but took the stand at trial and asserted his innocence.Â  The prosecutor\r\n  on cross-examination asked if he was read his rights after being arrested and\r\n  whether he understood them.Â  Gray responded affirmatively and the prosecutor\r\n  next asked if he then gave the story he was now presenting to the jury.Â  Gray replied\r\n  he only told the police he would not give a statement.Â  The prosecutor then\r\n  asked whether he expected the jury to believe him, at which point defense\r\n  counsel objected.Â  The objection was overruled and the prosecutor repeated his\r\n  last question.  \r\nIn\r\n  reversing Gray, this court asseverated, â€œ[c]ross examination by the\r\n  state of the defendant for impeachment purposes on the defendantâ€™s silence\r\n  after receiving the Miranda warnings is a violation of the Due Process\r\n  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.â€Â  Id. at 484, 405 S.E.2d at 421 (citing Doyle v.

Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 763 (1987) (the Miranda warningsâ€™ implicit\r\n  assurance provides â€œthe prerequisite of a Doyle violationâ€).\r\nIn a case setting the precedent for Brecht, the United\r\n  States Supreme Court in Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U.S. 603 (1982), guarded\r\n  against the expansion of Doyle. The Supreme Court held that, in the\r\n  absence of Miranda warnings, the state does not violate a defendantâ€™s\r\n  due process by permitting cross-examination on post-arrest silence when a\r\n  defendant takes the stand.Â  Fletcher, 455 U.S. at 607.\r\nThe defendant in Fletcher fatally stabbed a man during a\r\n  fight in a nightclub parking lot. He left the scene immediately and did not\r\n  report the incident to the police.Â  At trial he took the stand and, for the\r\n  first time, offered the exculpatory statement that the stabbing was in\r\n  self-defense and accidental. Nothing in the record indicated that the police\r\n  had read Fletcher his Miranda warnings immediately after arrest.Â  The\r\n  prosecutor cross-examined him as to why he failed to offer his self-defense\r\n  explanation to police.Â   \r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found an\r\n  arrest in itself was sufficient governmental action to trigger a defendantâ€™s\r\n  right to remain silent. Weir v. Fletcher, 658 F.2d 1126, 1131 (1981).Â \r\n  They opined â€œimpeachment of a defendant with post-arrest silence is forbidden\r\n  by the Constitution, regardless whether Miranda warnings are given.â€Â  Id. at 1130.Â  The Supreme Court reacted to this specific assertion stating,\r\n  â€œ[b]ecause we think the Court of Appeals gave an overly broad reading to our\r\n  decision in Doyle v. Ohioâ€¦we reverse its judgment.â€Â  Fletcher,\r\n  455 U.S. at 604.Â  The Court explicated:\r\n\r\n\tIn the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in\r\n  the Miranda warnings, we do not believe that it violates due process of\r\n  law for a State to permit cross-examination as to postarrest silence when a\r\n  defendant chooses to take the stand.Â  A State is entitled, in such situations,\r\n  to leave to the judge and jury under its own rules of evidence the resolution\r\n  of the extent to which postarrest silence may be deemed to impeach a criminal\r\n  defendantâ€™s own testimony.\r\n\r\nId. at 607.  \r\nIn Brecht\r\n  v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993), Brecht shot and killed his\r\n  brother-in-law in Wisconsin and immediately left the scene in his sisterâ€™s\r\n  car.Â  He crashed the car in a nearby town and told an officer who stopped to\r\n  help that his sister had already arranged for a tow truck.Â  Brecht then\r\n  hitchhiked to Minnesota where he was apprehended.Â  He was returned to Wisconsin and given the Miranda warnings.Â  \r\n \r\nBrecht\r\n  took the stand at his first-degree murder trial and testified the shooting was accidental.Â \r\n  The State disputed the defense on the basis that he did not seek help for his\r\n  brother-in-law, fled the scene, and lied to the officer who stopped to help\r\n  with the wrecked car.Â  The State highlighted Brechtâ€™s failure to tell this\r\n  account to the first officer, the man who gave him a ride, and the arresting\r\n  officers.Â  Over defense counselâ€™s objections, the State asked Brecht if he had\r\n  told anyone at any time prior to trial that the shooting was an accident.Â \r\n  Brecht answered that he had not.Â  The State made several references to Brechtâ€™s\r\n  silence in the closing argument.Â  Brecht was convicted and sentenced to life\r\n  imprisonment.\r\nOn appeal,\r\n  the Wisconsin Court of Appeals found the Stateâ€™s references to Brechtâ€™s post-Miranda silence violated Doyle and were so prejudicial as to warrant reversal.Â \r\n  The Wisconsin Supreme Court found the Doyle violation harmless and\r\n  reinstated the conviction.Â  Brecht then sought habeas corpus.Â  The\r\n  District Court set aside the conviction on the basis the Doyle violation\r\n  was not harmless error.Â  Next, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\r\n  reversed having taken issue with the appropriate harmless error standard for\r\n  federal habeas review.Â  The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to establish the proper harmless-error standard but first analyzed whether the\r\n  Stateâ€™s cross-examination of Brecht was improper.Â  The Court agreed the State\r\n  violated Doyle.Â  Brecht, 507 U.S. at 628-29.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Court noted that Brecht did not claim the shooting was accidental until he\r\n  testified at trial.Â  The Court stated â€œ[i]t was entirely proper-and\r\n  probative-for the State to impeach his testimony by pointing out that petitioner\r\n  had failed to tell anyone before the time he received his Miranda warnings at his arraignment about the shooting being an accident.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis added).Â Â  In contrariety, the Court expounded: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe Stateâ€™s references to [Brechtâ€™s] silence after that point in\r\n  time, or more generally to [Brechtâ€™s] failure to come forward with his version\r\n  of events at any time before trial â€¦ crossed the Doyle line.Â  For it is\r\n  conceivable that, once petitioner had been given his Miranda warnings,\r\n  he decided to stand on his right to remain silent because he believed his\r\n  silence would not be used against him at trial.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have recognized â€œDoyle holds that the Due Process Clause\r\n  prohibits the government from commenting on an accusedâ€™s post-Miranda silence.â€Â  State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 39, 599 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2004).\r\nRelying\r\n  on Brecht, this court in State v. Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 509\r\n  S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1998), found the State committed a Doyle violation\r\n  for referring to a defendantâ€™s silence both before and after receiving the Miranda warnings.Â  Brothers Jeremy and Aaron Holliday were convicted of carjacking and\r\n  resisting arrest among other charges after unsuccessfully attempting to steal a\r\n  car.Â  The morning after their arrest, the magistrate read the Miranda warnings at a bond hearing and asked both if they had anything to say.Â  Jeremy\r\n  confessed he was trying to steal the car. Â Aaron made no statement.Â  At trial,\r\n  he offered, for the first time, an exculpatory explanation.\r\nDuring an in camera Jackson v. Denno hearing, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), the trial court held that Aaronâ€™s silence was\r\n  inadmissible.Â  Nonetheless, over defense counselâ€™s objections, the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  cross-examination repeatedly referred to Aaronâ€™s failure to tell anyone this version\r\n  of events.Â  On appeal, this court noted â€œsome of the solicitorâ€™s questions\r\n  dealt with Aaronâ€™s failure to tell his story to anyone before he received his Miranda warnings, [but] other questions â€¦ clearly implicate the time period following\r\n  the Miranda warningsâ€¦.Â  Therefore, the solicitorâ€™s questions referencing\r\n  Aaronâ€™s silence violated the Doyle rule.â€Â  Holliday, 333 S.C. at\r\n  341, 509 S.E.2d at 284.Â  â€œIn light of the Supreme Courtâ€™s application of Doyle in Brecht, we find the solicitorâ€™s questions in this case improper.â€Â  Id. at 343, 509 S.E.2d at 285.\r\nIn State v. McIntosh, 358 S.C. 432, 443, 595 S.E.2d 484,\r\n  490 (2004), our supreme court analyzed Doyle to find a prosecutor had\r\n  improperly commented on a defendantâ€™s silence, but clarified:\r\n\r\n\tThe State may point out a defendantâ€™s silence prior to arrest, or\r\n  his silence after arrest but prior to the giving of Miranda warnings, in\r\n  order to impeach the defendantâ€™s testimony at trial.Â  Due process is not\r\n  violated because â€˜[s]uch silence is probative and does not rest on any implied\r\n  assurance by law enforcement authorities that it will carry no penalty.â€™Â  Brecht\r\n    v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 628, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 1716, 123 L. Ed. 2d 353,\r\n  366 (1993); Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 56 L. Ed.\r\n  2d 86 (1980).\r\n\r\nThis\r\n  court affirmed convictions in State v. Bell, 347 S.C. 267, 554 S.E.2d\r\n  435 (2001), despite the prosecutorâ€™s comments on the defendantâ€™s post-arrest\r\n  silence.Â  As with the case at bar, the record in Bell did not indicate\r\n  the defendant ever received the Miranda warnings, and we refused to\r\n  presume they had been given at the time of arrest.Â   \r\nBell was charged with possession of crack cocaine and possession with\r\n  intent to distribute crack cocaine, but she was not arrested for one week after\r\n  the drugs were found in her home.Â  At trial, Bell took the stand and alleged\r\n  the drugs belonged to her boyfriend.Â  During cross-examination, the prosecutor\r\n  asked how the police responded to the story.Â  She answered that the police had\r\n  never asked and she had never told.Â  Defense counselâ€™s subsequent objection was\r\n  sustained, and the trial judge issued a curative order.Â  The prosecutor then\r\n  suggested she had never told her family this story.Â  Again, defense counsel\r\n  objected and the judge overruled.Â  Bell moved for a mistrial arguing the trial\r\n  court erred in permitting the State to comment on her post-arrest silence.Â  The\r\n  motion was denied.\r\nOn appeal, we\r\n  found no evidence the Miranda warnings were given; thus, we found no\r\n  violation of Bellâ€™s right to due process.Â  In arriving at this decision, we\r\n  recognized that Doyle is only applicable after Miranda warnings\r\n  have been given. Bell, 347 S.C. at 269-70, 554 S.E.2d at 436.Â  Â Next, we\r\n  acknowledged that the United States Supreme Court distinguished Fletcher from Doyle because no Miranda warnings were given to Fletcher.Â  Id. at 270, 554 S.E.2d at 436-37. Â Â Lastly, we revisited Brecht for the\r\n  Supreme Courtâ€™s reiteration that the Doyle rule is based on the\r\n  fundamental unfairness of implicitly assuring a suspect that his silence will\r\n  not be used against him and then using the silence to impeach him at trial.Â  Id. at 270-71, 554 S.E.2d at 437.Â Â  Applying Doyle and its progeny, we ruled:\r\n\r\n\t[T]here\r\n  is no evidence in the record that Bell ever received Miranda warnings,\r\n  and we will not presume the warnings were given at the time of arrest.Â  See\r\n\tUnited States v. Cummiskey, 728 F.2d 200, 205 (3rd Cir. 1984)\r\n  (â€œAlthough nothing in the [Fletcher] record indicated the time Miranda warnings were given, the Supreme Court did not presume that the warnings were\r\n  given at the time of arrest.Â  Accordingly, we do not believe that we are \r\nauthorized\r\n  to engage in such a presumption.â€ (citation omitted)).Â  Although there was\r\n  testimony that Bell was arrested approximately one week after the search of her\r\n  apartment, her arrest alone is insufficient to implicitly induce Bell to remain silent.Â  See Fletcher, 455 U.S. at 603, 102 S. Ct. at 1309.Â  Therefore, we find no due process violation occurred as a result of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s cross-examination of Bell.\r\n\r\nId. at 271, 554 S.E.2d\r\n  at 437. Â Cf. State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 625 S.E.2d 641\r\n  (2006)Â  (holding Doyle inapplicable to defendantâ€™s statement made to a\r\n  friend prior to arrest and prior to Miranda warnings); State v. Hill,\r\n  360 S.C. 13, 16, 598 S.E.2d 732, 733 (Ct. App. 2004) (cross-examining defendant\r\n  on post-arrest, post-Miranda silence permissible where defendant gives\r\n  exculpatory testimony and alleges to have told police same version on arrest); State\r\n    v. Kimsey, 320 S.C. 344, 346, 465 S.E.2d 128, 130 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding\r\n  where defendant confesses one story to the police then â€œgives a different\r\n  version of his involvement in the offense at trial, Doyle does not\r\n  applyâ€).\r\nIn the case at\r\n  bar, there is no evidence in the record that Brown ever\r\n  received the Miranda warnings.Â  The investigating officer testified\r\n  about his investigation of the crime and his activities in speaking with\r\n  eyewitnesses.Â  However, there was no testimony recounting conversations with Brown nor\r\n  did the officer indicate whether Brown received Miranda warnings upon\r\n  his arrest.Â  A signed waiver of rights form was not introduced by the\r\n  solicitor, nor did Brown introduce evidence of such a form at the PCR hearing.Â \r\n  Therefore, Brown did not meet his burden of proving the solicitor committed a Doyle violation and that trial counsel erred in failing to object.Â  See, e.g., State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 194, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645\r\n  (1998) (appellant has burden to provide a sufficient record for review).Â  \r\n \r\nIncontrovertibly,\r\n  the evidentiary record extant in the case sub judice demonstrates\r\n  that no Doyle violation occurred because Petitioner was NOT advised on his Miranda warnings.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\r\n  OF COUNSEL\r\nTo\r\n  establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this proceeding, Brown\r\n  must prove (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance\r\n  under prevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance\r\n  prejudiced his case. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); State v. Edmond, 341 S.C. 340, 534 S.E.2d 682 (2000).\r\nBrown\r\n  claimed that his counsel was deficient in failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  comments on his silence during cross-examination and in closing argument.Â  He\r\n  asserted that, because the trial came down to his word versus the testimony of\r\n  the eight eyewitnesses, the outcome relied on his credibility.\r\na.&nbsp;TRIAL STRATEGY\r\nÂ â€œ[W]here\r\n  counsel articulates a valid reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.â€Â  Watson v. State,\r\n  370 S.C. 68, 72, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006). Â Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 610 S.E.2d 812 (2005); Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 419 S.E.2d\r\n  778 (1992). Counselâ€™s strategy will be reviewed under â€œan objective standard of\r\n  reasonableness.â€ Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 470, 560 S.E.2d 401, 402\r\n  (2002).\r\nIn Stokes v.\r\n  State, 308 S.C. 546, 419 S.E.2d 778 (1992), the petitioner, who was\r\n  convicted of murdering her husband, alleged she had received ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel because witnesses were not called who could possibly have\r\n  supported her suicide defense. Our supreme court affirmed her conviction and\r\n  stated â€œ[i]f there is any probative evidence in the record to support the PCR\r\n  judgeâ€™s decision, his ruling must be affirmed.Â  Where, as here, counsel articulates\r\n  a valid reason for employing certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.â€Â  Id. at 548, 419 S.E.2d at 779\r\n  (citations omitted). Counsel reported he only called those witnesses who were\r\n  believable.Â  He interviewed other witnesses but found they lacked credibility.Â  \r\n \r\nThe petitioner in Drayton v. Evatt, 312 S.C. 4, 430 S.E.2d 517 (1993), had been sentenced\r\n  to death for murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping.Â  In his PCR petition he\r\n  alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, but our supreme court found the trial\r\n  strategies reasonable.Â  Defense counsel did not present evidence of the\r\n  petitionerâ€™s future adaptability to prison.Â  Counsel testified to do so would\r\n  have required introduction of unfavorable psychiatric and disciplinary reports\r\n  from the petitionerâ€™s detention as a juvenile and incarceration as an adult.Â \r\n  Counsel did not develop testimony that the petitioner knew the victim believing\r\n  this would impact negatively with the jury.Â  Lastly, defense counselâ€™s statementâ€™s\r\n  during the sentencing phase admitting the petitioner was, inter alia,\r\n  â€œfar down the rung of societyâ€ was an appeal to the juryâ€™s sense of mercy.Â  Id. at 13, 430 S.E.2d at 522.\r\nIn Caprood v. State,\r\n  338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000), a petitioner seeking PCR after an armed\r\n  robbery conviction alleged trial counselâ€™s numerous errors amounted to ineffective\r\n  assistance.Â  Our supreme court affirmed that counsel had articulated valid\r\n  trial strategies. Â Counsel believed requesting curative instructions brings\r\n  into focus the item kept out.Â  Id. at 110, 525 S.E.2d at 517.Â  Defense\r\n  counsel introduced a detectiveâ€™s report with a description of the robber, but\r\n  he articulated he did so to show the differences between the report and witness\r\n  testimony.Â  Id.\r\nIn Rhodes v. State, 349\r\n  S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002), an assault victimâ€™s friend testified that he\r\n  gave the victim a school yearbook with the defendantâ€™s picture in it because he\r\n  heard a rumor the petitioner was involved in the crime.Â  The victim\r\n  subsequently identified the petitioner from the yearbook.Â  On appeal to the PCR\r\n  judge, the petitioner alleged his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to\r\n  this hearsay testimony.Â  Although our supreme court disagreed that the\r\n  testimony was hearsay, they concluded counsel offered a valid strategy in that\r\n  he used the testimony to reinforce the notion that the identification was\r\n  founded in rumor and innuendo.Â  Id. at 33, 561 S.E.2d at 610.\r\nCounsel was found deficient in Gilchrist v. State, 350 S.C. 221, 565 S.E.2d 281 (2002), for the failure\r\n  to object to the stateâ€™s vouching for the credibility of a key witness.Â  At the\r\n  PCR hearing, counsel explained he â€œthought seriously about making a mistrial\r\n  motion and objection to all of that at the time.Â  However, based upon the strategy\r\n  of the case, [he] decided not to.â€Â  Id. at 226, 565 S.E.2d at 284.Â  No\r\n  further explanation was given. Our supreme court noted â€œcounsel never\r\n  articulated any strategy at all.Â  A blanket statement by counsel at a PCR\r\n  hearing that he employed â€˜strategyâ€™ does not automatically insulate the lawyer\r\n  from being found ineffective.â€Â  Id. at 228, 565 S.E.2d at 284 n.2.\r\nIn Sanchez v.\r\n  State, 351 S.C. 270, 569 S.E.2d 363 (2002), the defendant appealed his\r\n  criminal sexual conduct conviction.Â  Our supreme court held representation was\r\n  ineffective because of counselâ€™s failure to object to a police officerâ€™s\r\n  hearsay testimony about the six year old victimâ€™s demonstration of the assault\r\n  using an anatomically correct doll.Â  Trial counsel felt the testimony would be useful\r\n  to show the accusations were vague.Â  Id. at 274, 569 S.E.2d at 365.Â \r\n  However, this strategy was deemed unreasonable as the hearsay corroborated the\r\n  victimâ€™s testimony at trial.Â  Id. at 276, 569 S.E.2dÂ  at 366.\r\nOur supreme\r\n  court affirmed a petitionerâ€™s convictions for trafficking cocaine and\r\n  possession of cocaine in McLaughlin v. State, 352 S.C. 476, 575 S.E.2d\r\n  841 (2003).Â  Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to preserve for\r\n  appeal the trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow cross-examination of the stateâ€™s\r\n  chemist regarding his own drug arrest.Â  The trial judge decided defense counsel\r\n  could inquire whether the chemist was under the influence of drugs while\r\n  testing the cocaine evidence in this case, but he could not inquire into the\r\n  chemistâ€™s arrest.Â  Defense counsel chose not to ask the permitted questions at\r\n  all.Â  Counsel explained that, without being able to inquire about the chemistâ€™s\r\n  arrest, asking only the permitted questions would not have advanced the\r\n  petitionerâ€™s case.Â  In addition to finding defense counsel had proffered the\r\n  questions, our supreme court held â€œcounsel gave a valid reason for consciously\r\n  deciding not to ask those questions.â€Â  Id. at 483, 575 S.E.2d at 845.\r\nIn Ellenburg\r\n  v. State, 367 S.C. 66, 625 S.E.2d 224 (2006), Ellenburg alleged his defense\r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s comments made\r\n  during closing argument.Â  At his trial for safecracking and second degree\r\n  burglary, an accomplice testified to his version of events.Â  Defense counsel\r\n  argued in closing that the story was a half truth told to avoid being subjected\r\n  to a polygraph machine by the police.Â  The solicitor responded by asking why\r\n  the accomplice would lie when faced with the prospect of taking a lie detector\r\n  test.Â  Our supreme court held defense counselâ€™s mention of the polygraph test\r\n  was â€œa reasonable way to cast doubt on [the accompliceâ€™s] testimony implicating\r\n  [Ellenburg].â€Â  Id. at 69, 625 S.E.2d at 226.Â  Additionally, because the\r\n  defense opened the door to the polygraph issue, the solicitorâ€™s statement in\r\n  closing was not improper.Â  Id.\r\nIn Watson v.\r\n  State, 370 S.C. 68, 634 S.E.2d 642 (2006), our supreme court disagreed with\r\n  the PCR court that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to certain\r\n  hearsay testimony introduced in a criminal sexual conduct trial.Â  Counsel had\r\n  reasonable strategy because she felt an objection would likely lead to the more\r\n  damaging introduction of a videotape of the child victim talking about the\r\n  abuse. Id. at 73, 634 S.E.2d at 644.\r\nOur supreme court\r\n  in Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 642 S.E.2d 590 (2007), found defense\r\n  counsel ineffective for not more fully investigating and challenging gunshot\r\n  residue when such evidence was crucial to the outcome of the case.Â \r\n  Specifically, defense counselâ€™s decision to not cross-examine the Stateâ€™s\r\n  gunshot residue expert and instead focusing on the manner in which evidence was\r\n  collected was not an objectively reasonable strategy.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Brownâ€™s counsel\r\n  did not render ineffective assistance was based on counselâ€™s articulation of\r\n  valid trial strategies.Â  Testimony\r\n  from Brownâ€™s counsel at the post-conviction relief hearing revealed it was not\r\n  his strategy to object to all issues generated in a trial because he felt doing\r\n  so creates a negative impression with the jury.Â  Additionally, counsel\r\n  testified the Stateâ€™s evidence made this as strong a case as he had seen.Â Â Â  He\r\n  believed the best strategy was to highlight for the jury the discrepancies\r\n  between the eyewitnessesâ€™ testimony and hope they would find it dubious.\r\nIt is manifest and irrefutable that trial counsel was NOT ineffective.Â  Apodictically, there was no legal or factual basis for an\r\n  objection bottomed and premised on Doyle.Â  Trial counsel conducted a\r\n  salutary and salubrious representation of Brown.Â   \r\nb.&nbsp;PREJUDICE\r\nThe\r\n  PCR court found that even if there were a failure to object, Brown failed to\r\n  establish prejudice.Â  We decline to address this issue because of our\r\n  disposition of Issues I and II.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to make certain\r\n  objections because the record does not show a Doyle violation occurred.Â \r\n  Furthermore, we do NOT address the issue of prejudice because of\r\n  our ruling on the Doyle issue.Â  Accordingly, Brownâ€™s conviction and\r\n  sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKittredge,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nHearn,\r\n  C.J., concurs in result only in a separate opinion. \r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., concurring in a separate opinion: I\r\n  concur in the result reached by the majority, but would simply dismiss the writ\r\n  of certiorari as improvidently granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4298","title":"Stalk v.

Â We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nStalk was indicted on one count of\r\n  first-degree burglary and six counts of second degree burglary, four counts of\r\n  grand larceny, and one count of aggravated resisting arrest.Â  The first-degree\r\n  burglary was reduced to second-degree.Â  Stalk pled guilty to all charges.Â  He\r\n  was sentenced to (1) fifteen years imprisonment for the seven burglary charges,\r\n  with one count served consecutively to the other six; (2) ten years for the\r\n  grand larceny indictments, served consecutively to the burglary sentences; and\r\n  (3) ten years for aggravated resisting arrest, served consecutively to the\r\n  larceny sentences.Â  In the aggregate, Stalk was sentenced to fifty years\r\n  imprisonment.  \r\nStalk\r\n  agreed with and affirmed the Stateâ€™s recitation of the facts at the guilty plea\r\n  proceeding. Â The State reported that officers investigating the burglary and\r\n  larceny crimes identified Stalk as a suspect and visited his residence to\r\n  question him.Â  While there, the officers observed a number of items in Stalkâ€™s\r\n  apartment that had been reported stolen.Â  When they attempted to arrest Stalk he\r\n  resisted and injured the officers in the struggle that ensued.Â  Â Â \r\nAt the\r\n  plea proceeding Stalk testified that he was thirty-two years old and had an\r\n  eleventh grade education.Â  He worked in construction and was not married.Â  He\r\n  admitted to treatment for drug abuse that he did not complete.Â  Stalk denied any\r\n  physical or emotional problems that might prevent him from understanding why he\r\n  was in court.Â  The plea court asked Stalk:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Do you understand that each of these seven indictments\r\n  allege that you did in Lancaster County on the dates specified in the\r\n  indictments willfully and unlawfully entered [sic] the dwellings of the persons\r\n  specified in the indictments without consent and with the intent to commit a\r\n  crime therein?Â  Do you understand that? \r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir. \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Do you understand that the court could sentence you up to\r\n  fifteen years in regard to each indictment for burglary in the second degree? \r\n\t\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  In the four indictments charging you with grand larceny it\r\n  is alleged that you did in Lancaster County on the dates specified in each of\r\n  the four different indictments feloniously take and carry away the personal\r\n  property of the said individuals named in the indictments with the intent to deprive\r\n  the owners permanently of the possession of said property and that the property\r\n  was valued at more than five thousand dollars in each of the four indictments.Â \r\n  Do you fully understand the charge of grand larceny?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Do you understand the court could have sentenced you up to\r\n  ten years in regard to each of the four different indictments on each offense?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  The last indictment alleges that you did in Lancaster County on or about August 11, 1998, knowingly and willfully beat, injure or wound\r\n  Captain Rollings and Lt. Bailey, law enforcement officers of this State, while\r\n  resisting the efforts of said officers to place you under lawful arrest.Â  Do\r\n  you understand this charge of resisting arrest . . . ?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Do you understand the court could sentence you to up to\r\n  ten years in prison for a violation of that law?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Do you fully understand that adding all of the maximum\r\n  sentences that could be imposed you could receive a sentence of up to one\r\n  hundred and fifty-five years in prison on all of these charges?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir. \r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Understanding the\r\n  charges contained in all of the separate indictments against you, understanding\r\n  the maximum sentences you could receive, how do you wish to plead, guilty or\r\n  not guilty?\r\n\tA. Â Â Â Â  Guilty.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  plea court advised Stalk that by entering a guilty plea he waived or gave up his\r\n  constitutional rights to (1) remain silent and not be compelled to testify against\r\n  himself; (2) be tried by a jury of peers or equals to which the State would be\r\n  required to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) confront and\r\n  cross-examine any witnesses the State called to testify against him at a trial\r\n  of his case.Â  The court asked Stalk:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Do\r\n  you wish to give up these rights and plead guilty today?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\r\nStalk\r\n  professed he was not threatened or forced to plead guilty or promised anything in\r\n  exchange for pleading guilty.Â  He confirmed he entered the plea of his own free\r\n  will and accord. Â Stalk then stated he was guilty and he did commit the seven\r\n  burglaries, four grand larcenies, and one resisting arrest as indicated in the\r\n  factual record and in the indictments.Â  The plea court questioned Stalkâ€™s\r\n  counsel as follows:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Have you had a full opportunity to explain to [Stalk] the\r\n  charges contained in each of these bills of indictment, advise him of all of\r\n  his constitutional rights as well as the maximum sentences he could receive?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Does\r\n  Mr. Stalk fully understand these matters?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  I\r\n  believe he does, your honor. \r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Does\r\n  he indicate how he wishes to plead?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Guilty. \r\n\tQ:Â Â Â  From your investigation of his cases do you agree with his Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  decision?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  I\r\n  do, your honor. \r\n\r\nStalk\r\n  declared he was satisfied with his counselâ€™s representation in the following\r\n  colloquy:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Are\r\n  you satisfied with the services of your lawyer, Mr. [Â  ]?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Has\r\n  he done everything you have asked him to do for you in regards\r\n  to your cases?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Has\r\n  he refused to do anything you have asked him to do?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  No,\r\n  sir.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The\r\n  court accepted Stalkâ€™s plea of guilty, finding it was voluntarily, knowingly\r\n  and intelligently made, with the advice and counsel of a competent lawyer with\r\n  whom Stalk said he was satisfied.Â  Prior to sentencing, Stalkâ€™s counsel\r\n  addressed the court:\r\n[I]t is rare that anybody with near this number of pending charges\r\n  would sit down with me and then later sit down with me and the solicitor and\r\n  this is what I did.Â  While Mr. Stalk certainly is a burglar, he is an honest burglar,\r\n  he told them exactly what happened and has not tried to hide from the\r\n  consequences of his actions.Â  He had done some time in jail, got out, he was\r\n  engaged, she was pregnant, he was unable to find work, and he resorted back to\r\n  bad habits.Â  He has been in jail a while now, he understands that he could have\r\n  been facing as you indicated a hundred and fifty-five years, he could have been\r\n  facing a potential life sentence on the original charges, and I indicated to\r\n  him that any sort of negotiations less than that would certainly be to his\r\n  advantage.Â  He left it in my and the solicitorâ€™s hands to come up with this\r\n  negotiation and he has cooperated in basically leaving it up to us and the\r\n  State to come up with something less than the worse case scenario.Â  We ask for\r\n  mercy.Â  \r\nStalk filed an application for post-conviction relief, which the\r\n  PCR court granted.[1]Â \r\n  The State appealed and filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.Â \r\n  The matter was transferred to this court and the Stateâ€™s petition granted.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\t Did the PCR court err in finding Stalkâ€™s guilty plea was\r\n  \t\t\trendered involuntary by the ineffective assistance of his counsel?Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.  \r\n\t\t\t Did the PCR court err in granting relief when Stalk presented\r\n  no evidence of prejudice?Â   \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis court\r\n  gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law. Â Porter v. State, 368 S.C. 378, 383, 629 S.E.2d 353, 356 (2006). Â On\r\n  review, a PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of\r\n  probative value sufficient to support them. Â Id. (citing Cherry v.\r\n    State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989)). Â However, where\r\n  there is no evidence of probative value to support the findings of the PCR\r\n  court, the appellate court will reverse. Â Bright v. State, 365 S.C. 355,\r\n  358, 618 S.E.2d 296, 298 (2005); Magazine v. State, 361 S.C. 610, 615,\r\n  606 S.E.2d 761, 763 (2004) (citing Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144,\r\n  526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000)).Â Â Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe essential allegation raised by Stalk\r\n  involves the involuntary nature of his guilty plea due to the alleged lack of\r\n  preparation and unreasonable conduct of his appointed counsel.Â   \r\nIn the\r\n  order granting Stalkâ€™s application for relief, the PCR court reasoned:\r\n\r\n\t[Stalk] testified that he was coerced by his counsel who seemingly\r\n  was unprepared.Â  The applicant testified that his first meeting with his\r\n  counsel, [ ], was in the presence of the prosecuting attorney, [ ]. Â The applicant\r\n  further testified that his counsel never met with him to discuss his case,\r\n  never discussed the pending charges, and never discussed possible defenses.Â \r\n  Despite having pleaded guilty and answering the Court in the affirmative at\r\n  this guilty plea, the applicant testified that he understood that the sentences\r\n  would all run concurrently.Â  The applicant further testified that he was\r\n  coerced into pleading guilty because he had no confidence in his lawyer.Â  He\r\n  stated that he would probably not have pled guilty had his lawyer been\r\n  prepared.Â Â  \r\n\tUpon cross-examination, Mr. Stalk insisted that [his attorney]\r\n  failed to call the co-defendant.Â  He also confirmed previous testimony that [his\r\n  attorney] had only met with him once prior to entering the plea and that the\r\n  meeting took place in the presence of the prosecuting attorney.Â  As such [Stalk]\r\n  was unduly coerced into the plea agreement and would have otherwise insisted on\r\n  going to trial. \r\n\r\nThe PCR court\r\n  concluded:\r\n\r\n\t[Stalk] has established that he did not receive effective\r\n  assistance from his court appointed attorney.Â  This Court further finds that\r\n  the State has offered no evidence to refute the allegations of [Stalk].Â \r\n  Furthermore, this Court finds that due to the conduct of [Stalk]â€™s attorney,\r\n  [Stalk] was prejudiced in not having the opportunity to go forward with trial.Â \r\n  Based on [Stalk]â€™s unrefuted testimony, this Court finds that there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that [Stalk] would have insisted on going to trial.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe State\r\n  contends that the PCR court erred in granting Stalk relief. Â We agree.Â   \r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief. Â Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d 884,\r\n  886 (2007) (citing Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514,\r\n  517 (2000)); Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 302, 509 S.E.2d 807, 809\r\n  (1998).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate\r\n  assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\n  significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Morris v. State, 371 S.C. 278, 282,\r\n  639 S.E.2d 53, 55 (2006); Magazine v. State, 361 S.C. 610, 617, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 761, 764 (2004).  \r\nStrickland\r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), established a two-prong test for\r\n  evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Â The first prong of the\r\n  test requires that a defendant prove his counselâ€™s deficiency by demonstrating\r\n  counselâ€™s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Bennett\r\n    v. State, 371 S.C. 198, 203, 638 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2006) (citing Strickland).\r\n  Â The second part of the test requires a defendant to show there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\n  proceeding would have been different.Â  Id.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  applicant may attack the voluntary, knowing, and intelligent character of a\r\n  guilty plea entered on the advice of counsel by demonstrating that counselâ€™s\r\n  representation was below an objective standard of reasonableness. Â Porter v.\r\n    State, 368 S.C. 378, 383-84, 629 S.E.2d 353, 356 (2006); Roscoe v. State,\r\n  345 S.C. 16, 20, 546 S.E.2d 417, 419 (2001).Â  The â€œprejudice,â€ requirement\r\n  focuses on whether counselâ€™s constitutionally ineffective performance affected\r\n  the outcome of the plea process.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985).Â  In other words, the applicant must prove prejudice by showing that,\r\n  but for counselâ€™s inadequacy, there is a reasonable probability he would not\r\n  have pleaded guilty and, instead, would have insisted on going to trial.Â  Suber,\r\n  371 S.C. at 558, 640 S.E.2d at 886.Â   \r\nTo find\r\n  a guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly entered into, the record must establish\r\n  the defendant had a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and the\r\n  charges against him. Â Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969); Roddy\r\n    v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 33-34, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421 (2000).Â  â€œA defendantâ€™s\r\n  knowing and voluntary waiver of the constitutional rights which accompany a\r\n  guilty plea may be accomplished by colloquy between the Court and the\r\n  defendant, between the Court and defendantâ€™s counsel, or both.â€Â  Pittman v.\r\n    State, 337 S.C. 597, 625, 524 S.E.2d 623, 659 (1999).Â   \r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  voluntariness of a guilty plea is not determined by an examination of the\r\n  specific inquiry made by the sentencing judge alone, but is determined from\r\n  both the record made at the time of the entry of the guilty plea and the record\r\n  of the post-conviction hearing.â€Â  Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 133,\r\n  318 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1984).Â  â€œWhen determining issues relating to guilty pleas,\r\n  this Court will consider the entire record, including the transcript of the\r\n  guilty pleas and the evidence presented at the PCR hearing.â€Â  Roddy, 339\r\n  S.C. at 33, 528 S.E.2d at 420. Â In considering an allegation on PCR that a\r\n  guilty plea was based on inaccurate advice of counsel, the transcript of the\r\n  guilty plea hearing will be considered to determine whether any possible error by\r\n  counsel was cured by the information conveyed at the plea hearing. Â Wolfe v.\r\n    State, 326 S.C. 158, 165, 485 S.E.2d 367, 370 (1997).Â   \r\n1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r\nStalk claimed\r\n  his attorney met with him only one time prior to the plea hearing and was\r\n  inadequately prepared.Â  He asserted counsel did not go over the warrants, did\r\n  not ask him about potential defenses or witnesses, did not inform him of his\r\n  right to a jury trial, and did not ask about Stalkâ€™s sentencing expectations.Â  Stalk\r\n  admitted his attorney told him that he faced a potential one hundred fifty-five\r\n  year aggregate sentence if convicted at trial.Â  Additionally, Stalk averred he\r\n  only had ten or fifteen minutes to make up his mind about whether to plead\r\n  guilty.Â  He stated he felt coerced to plead guilty because he lacked confidence\r\n  in his attorney.  \r\nTestimony\r\n  from Stalkâ€™s counsel at the plea hearing indicated he first sat down with Stalk\r\n  alone and then â€œlaterâ€ sat down with Stalk and the Solicitor.Â  Counsel believed\r\n  Stalk understood he could face one hundred fifty-five yearsâ€”a potential life\r\n  sentenceâ€”if found guilty at trial.Â  Consequently, he advised Stalk that any\r\n  negotiation resulting in less time would be to his advantage.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination at the PCR hearing, Stalk initially stated he met with his\r\n  attorney one time, in the presence of the Solicitor.Â  However, on redirect,\r\n  Stalkâ€™s testimony suggests he met with counsel earlier in the day before\r\n  meeting with counsel and the Solicitor:Â   \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t[Your attorney] indicates in his \r\n\t\t\tstatement to the court that he had met with you prior toâ€”how soon \r\n\t\t\tprior to that guilty plea did he meet with you?&nbsp; He said he met \r\n\t\t\twith you before meeting with you and [the Solicitor].&nbsp; How much \r\n\t\t\ttime elapsed from that first meeting and your meeting withâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStalk: \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;On the same day.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tWas it the same day?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStalk:  \r\n\t\t\tThe same day it was a bond \r\n\t\t\thearing and I met with him about a bond hearing.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tPrior to meeting with him and \r\n\t\t\t[the Solicitor] did you met with [your attorney] also that same day \r\n\t\t\tbefore meeting with [the Solicitor]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStalk:&nbsp;  \r\n\t\t\tI met with him here, back here.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn our\r\n  view, Stalkâ€™s conflicting testimony provides little reliable evidence that he\r\n  met only once with his attorney.\r\nWe do\r\n  not agree with the PCR court that Stalk established ineffective assistance of\r\n  his court appointed attorney.Â  In basing his finding on Stalkâ€™s â€œunrefuted\r\n  testimony,â€ the PCR court apparently disregarded Stalkâ€™s testimony at the plea\r\n  hearing.Â  Stalkâ€™s PCR testimony blatantly and completely contradicted his\r\n  earlier attestations at the plea hearing concerning the voluntariness of his guilty\r\n  plea.Â  At the PCR proceeding Stalk averred:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStalk:\r\n\t\t\tWhen I went up there, mostly I \r\n\t\t\twas talking to the Judge.&nbsp; He asked me did I understand what \r\n\t\t\twas going on and I said, â€œYes.â€&nbsp; He asked me did I know what I \r\n\t\t\twas pleading to and I said, â€œYes.â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tWhy did you say that?&nbsp; When \r\n\t\t\the was asking you these questions, did you really understand what he \r\n\t\t\twas asking?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStalk: \r\n\t\t\tNo, I was still mixed up.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tWhy didnâ€™t you stop him and tell \r\n\t\t\thim you didnâ€™t understand?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStalk:\r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  transcript of the guilty plea clearly refutes Stalkâ€™s assertion that he did not\r\n  understand the terms of the guilty plea.Â  See Rayford v.

State, 329 S.C. 345, 495 S.E.2d 768\r\n  (1998).Â  Mere speculation of what a witnessâ€™ testimony may be is insufficient\r\n  to satisfy the burden of showing prejudice in a petition for PCR. Â Porter v.\r\n    State, 368 S.C. 378, 386-87, 629 S.E.2d 353, 358 (2006) (holding no\r\n  evidence showedÂ  counselâ€™s failure to interview a potential witness would have\r\n  yielded a result different from that which defendantâ€™s counsel believed at the\r\n  time of the plea; defendant pled guilty in light of the complete information\r\n  that was available at that time).  \r\nIn addition, Stalk testified he believed his sentences would run\r\n  concurrently rather than consecutively, suggesting he would not have pled\r\n  guilty had he known otherwise.Â  There is no evidence, whatsoever, in the\r\n  record, prior to Stalkâ€™s PCR testimony, that he was induced to plead guilty\r\n  based his understanding the sentences would run concurrently.Â  â€œWishful thinking\r\n  regarding sentencing does not equal a misapprehension concerning the possible\r\n  range of sentences, especially where one acknowledges on the record that one\r\n  knows the range of sentences and that no promises have been made.â€Â  Wolfe,\r\n  326 S.C. at 165, 485 S.E.2d at 371.Â  Moreover, counselâ€™s plea negotiations for Stalk\r\n  proved advantageous.Â  The first degree burglary count was reduced to second\r\n  degree, and Stalk received a sentence considerably less than the one hundred\r\n  fifty-five years he might have received if convicted by a jury.Â  See Bright\r\n    v.

Miller, Jr. (Husband) contends the family court erred\r\n  by: (1) holding him in contempt for barring Respondentâ€™s (Wifeâ€™s) entry into\r\n  the marital home to retrieve property, removing property from the marital home,\r\n  and secreting the property in another location; (2) requiring the return of certain\r\n  property to Wife; (3) failing to find Wife in contempt; and (4) ordering him to\r\n  pay a portion of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm as modified.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWife initiated an action\r\n  for separate support and maintenance, equitable division of marital property,\r\n  and other related relief in August of 2004.Â  Husband and Wife reached an\r\n  agreement resolving all issues on a temporary basis.Â  The family court approved\r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreement as the Temporary Order of the Court, finding â€œ[b]oth\r\n  parties expressed their opinion that they believed the [temporary] agreement to\r\n  be in their best interests . . . .Â  The parties further affirmed their\r\n  understanding that their agreement will be set forth in a Temporary Order of\r\n  this Court, and as such, that the agreement is enforceable by the contempt\r\n  powers of this Court.â€Â   \r\nThe Temporary Order provided,\r\n  in pertinent part, that:\r\n\r\n\t1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  former marital home will be placed on the market for sale, with the [Husband]\r\n  making necessary repairs to the master bathroom, the kitchen ceiling, and the\r\n  fountain in the front yard.Â  [Husband] will replace the original locks on the\r\n  doors and replace the doorknobs.\r\n\t2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  [Husband]\r\n  will make the monthly mortgage payment on the home, in the approximate amount\r\n  of $2,200.00 and [Wife] will pay for the lawn maintenance.Â  The parties will\r\n  split the utility bills for the home while it is on the market . . . .\r\n\t3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Each\r\n  party will keep the vehicle in his or her respective possession and pay the\r\n  expenses of said vehicles. Â The parties will each obtain insurance on the\r\n  vehicles in his or her possession, and neither will list the other as a driver\r\n  on the othersâ€™ automobile insurance policy.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\t8.Â Â Â Â Â Â  [Wife]\r\n  will remove all remaining property from the former residence, to prepare it for\r\n  sale, and she will store such property at her residence. \r\n\t9. Â Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  parties will be mutually restrained from liquidating or transferring any\r\n  marital assets or property of any type to other parties, hiding or secreting\r\n  said property and/or assets and/or removing money from any bank accounts other\r\n  than those necessary to pay the monthly household bills and expenses.Â  Â \r\n\r\nWife vacated the marital\r\n  home shortly after the parties separated in order to prepare the home for sale.Â \r\n  Husband lived with his parents when the parties separated but moved back into\r\n  the home in October, 2004, and remained there until the end of November, 2004.\r\nOn several occasions\r\n  Wife attempted to gain access to the marital home to retrieve remaining property\r\n  as directed by the Temporary Order.Â  Wife testified Husband prevented her from\r\n  entering the marital home.Â  Witnesses Sandy Weaver and Genie Shealy generally corroborated\r\n  Wifeâ€™s testimony that Husband had not allowed her entry into the home after\r\n  several attempts.Â  Wife averred Husband changed the locks on the doors without\r\n  her knowledge or consent, making entry impossible.Â   \r\nOn one occasion Wife pre-arranged\r\n  a time with Husband to remove the remaining items from the home.Â  She rented a\r\n  U-Haul truck and enlisted the help of several family members.Â  Wife claimed\r\n  Husband had one weekâ€™s notice of this scheduled removal.Â  However, on the day\r\n  Wife and her family planned to secure the property, Husbandâ€™s friend,\r\n  apparently acting on Husbandâ€™s behalf, barred them from entering the home.Â  When\r\n  wife eventually entered the home on a later date, she found the remaining property\r\n  she was to retrieve pursuant to the Temporary Order, including a vintage Ford\r\n  Mustang, had been removed.Â   \r\nOn cross-examination\r\n  Wife admitted she had alternative access to the home through the garage door.Â \r\n  However, Wifeâ€™s attorney had advised her not to enter the home on her own while\r\n  Husband was living there.Â   \r\nHusband denied he\r\n  hindered Wifeâ€™s entry into the home, maintaining he prevented her entry at the\r\n  originally appointed time only because he had to go out of town and needed to\r\n  reschedule.Â  He claimed she could have arranged to enter at a later time.Â \r\n  Husband acknowledged, however, that he had removed items, including the Ford\r\n  Mustang, from the marital home and was currently storing property in a another\r\n  location.\r\nWife filed an initial\r\n  Rule to Show Cause motion on or about December 7, 2004, charging, inter alia,\r\n  that Husband had refused to allow Wife access to the marital home to retrieve\r\n  remaining property as ordered by the Court.Â  Wife filed an Amended Contempt\r\n  Complaint on January 27, 2005, for additional violations of the Temporary\r\n  Order, alleging Husband (1) refused to cooperate in the preparation and sale of\r\n  the marital home, (2) changed the locks on the doors of the marital home, (3) prevented\r\n  her from retrieving her personal belongings, and (4) moved the majority of her\r\n  belongings to another state without Wifeâ€™s knowledge or consent.  \r\nHusband filed a Rule to\r\n  Show Cause, Answer and Counterclaim against Wife on February 9, 2005,\r\n  complaining that Wife violated the Temporary Order by failing to (1) return\r\n  business records and computer accessories, (2) pay for lawn maintenance, and (3)\r\n  remove and store at her residence the remaining property in the marital home.Â \r\n \r\nThe family court found Husband\r\n  in contempt for barring Wife from entering the marital home to retrieve\r\n  remaining property and ordered him to return the Ford Mustang and all its parts\r\n  to Wife within thirty (30) days of the hearing.[2] Â Wife was ordered to return business records and computer accessories to\r\n  Husband within thirty (30) days.  \r\nHusband filed a Motion\r\n  for Reconsideration.Â  In an Amended Order dated March 31, 2005, noting that neither\r\n  party proved all the allegations set forth in his or her Contempt Complaint, the\r\n  family court held:\r\n\r\n\t6.Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is explicit and unequivocal\r\n  that [Husband] is in willful contempt of this Court for refusing to allow [Wife]\r\n  to retrieve her personal belongings from the marital home, for removing the\r\n  belongings from the marital home, and from South Carolina, and for secreting\r\n  the belongings in or near Savannah, Georgia, without [Wife]â€™s knowledge or\r\n  consent which he no right to do.Â  This has been proven to a clear and\r\n  convincing standard of proof.Â  The [temporary] order clearly allows and\r\n  required the [Wife] to remove all marital property from the marital home. Â [Husband]\r\n  should, and hereby shall, return [Wife]â€™s property to her, at his own expense,\r\n  within thirty (30) days of this Order.Â  This includes the Ford Mustang\r\n  automobile and all parts, at an agreed upon location and time and in the\r\n  condition as when removed.Â  Should [Husband] not return the property within\r\n  that time, he shall immediately begin serving a sentence of twelve (12) months\r\n  incarceration in the Greenville County Detention Center. Â [Husband] to be\r\n  released by the return of such property.Â  The act of removal and the act of\r\n  barring the wife is criminal contempt.Â  These acts have been proven beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . .  \r\n\r\n\t8.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The [Husband] did change the\r\n  locks on the doors and occupy the marital home, thereby making it impossible\r\n  for the wife to enter the home.Â  He or his friend actually barred the [Wife].Â \r\n  The Court further finds that [Wife] did not enter the marital home to retrieve\r\n  her personal belongings, as set forth in the Temporary Order, due to the [Husband]â€™s\r\n  preventing [Wife] from doing so.Â  Therefore, the Court finds that [Wife] is not\r\n  in contempt on such charges. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI. Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err and abuse its discretion in\r\n  finding Â Husband in contempt for refusing to allow Wife to retrieve remaining\r\n  property from the marital home, removing the property from the marital home,\r\n  and secreting the property in or near Savannah, Georgia? \r\n\tII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err in finding Husband in\r\n  criminal contempt?\r\n\tIII.Â Â Â  Did the family court err in ordering Husband to return\r\n  the Ford Mustang and all parts to Wife?\r\n\tIV.Â Â Â  Did the family court err in finding Wife was not in\r\n  contempt for failure to remove and store remaining property from the marital\r\n  home because Husband prevented her from entering the home to retrieve the\r\n  property? \r\n\tV.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err and abuse its discretion in\r\n  ordering Husband to pay two-thirds (2/3) of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in\r\n  the amount of $5,321.63?\r\n\r\nHusband contends\r\n  the family court erred in not finding Wife in contempt for failure to pay for\r\n  lawn maintenance.Â  The family court did not rule on this issue at the hearing\r\n  or in the Amended Order, and Husband neglected to raise it in his Motion for\r\n  Reconsideration.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved and we decline to\r\n  address it on review.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court should reverse a decision regarding contempt â€œonly if it is\r\n  without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.â€ Â Durlach\r\n    v.

Â â€œSouth Carolina courts have always taken a liberal and\r\n  expansive view of the â€˜presenceâ€™ and â€˜courtâ€™ requirements.Â  This Stateâ€™s courts\r\n  have held the â€˜presence of the courtâ€™ extends beyond the mere physical presence\r\n  of the judge or the courtroom to encompass all elements of the system.â€ Â Kennerly,\r\n  337 S.C. at 620, 524 S.E.2d at 838.Â  â€œ[T]he court consists not of the judge,\r\n  the jury, or the jury room individually, but all of these combined. Â The court\r\n  is present wherever any of its constituent parts is engaged in the prosecution\r\n  of the business of the court according to the law.â€Â  Id. at 620-21, 524\r\n  S.E.2d at 838 (citing Goff, 228 S.C. at 23, 88 S.E.2d at 791).Â  Â \r\nâ€œConstructive contempt is contemptuous conduct\r\n  occurring outside the presence of the court.â€ Â Kennerly, 331 S.C. at\r\n  451, 503 S.E.2d at 219 (citing Toyota of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch, 314\r\n  S.C. 257, 442 S.E.2d 611 (1994)).  \r\nâ€œThe distinction between direct and constructive\r\n  contempt is important because it determines how the contempt proceedings must\r\n  be brought.â€Â  Id. â€œA rule to show cause for direct contempt may be\r\n  issued without a supporting affidavit or verified petition.â€Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, a charge of constructive contempt brought by a rule to show cause must\r\n  be based on an affidavit or verified petition.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe failure to\r\n  support the rule to show cause by an affidavit or verified petition is a fatal\r\n  defect.â€Â  Lynch, 314 S.C. at 267, 442 S.E.2d at 617.Â   \r\nIn Kennerly, the pivotal question was\r\n  whether the contemnorâ€™s conduct constituted direct or constructive contempt. Â Kennerly\r\n  was a juror in a capital murder trial in which the defendant was found guilty\r\n  and received a sentence of life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.Â  Kennerly,\r\n  331 S.C. at 446-49, 503 S.E.2d at 216-18. Â The solicitor filed a petition\r\n  alleging Kennerly was in contempt of court for failing to disclose her\r\n  relationship with the defendant during voir dire and for\r\n  initiating premature discussions with other jurors in violation of the judgeâ€™s\r\n  instructions.Â  Id.Â  The trial court found Kennerly guilty of contempt\r\n  and she appealed, arguing the solicitorâ€™s rule to show cause was not based upon\r\n  a sworn affidavit or a verified pleading. Â Id. at 449-50, 503 S.E.2d at\r\n  18.Â  She maintained the contemptuous conduct was not direct contempt because it\r\n  occurred outside the presence of the court.Â  Likewise, she averred the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s unverified petition was fatal to a charge of constructive contempt.\r\n  Â Id. Â \r\nThe court found Kennerlyâ€™s conduct occurred where\r\n  the jury was required to be, in the jury room and hotel where sequestered, and\r\n  while the jurors were performing their legal duties.Â  â€œBecause Kennerlyâ€™s\r\n  conduct occurred within the sight and hearing of an integral and constituent\r\n  part of the court, her conduct was â€˜in the presence of the courtâ€™ and\r\n  constituted direct contempt.â€Â  Kennerly, 337 S.C. at 622, 524 S.E.2d at\r\n  839.Â  Kennerlyâ€™s behavior was not constructive contempt, and, therefore, the\r\n  absence of an affidavit or verified petition was not fatal to the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  action.\r\nB. Â Civil v. Criminal Contempt\r\nThe determination of whether\r\n  contempt is civil or criminal depends on the underlying purpose of the contempt\r\n  ruling.Â  In Floyd v. Floyd, we provided\r\n  a comprehensive review of the differences between civil and criminal contempt:\r\n\r\n\tThe major factor in determining whether\r\n  a contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is\r\n  exercised, including the nature of the relief and the purpose for which the\r\n  sentence is imposed. Â The purpose of civil contempt is to coerce the defendant\r\n  to do the thing required by the order for the benefit of the complainant.\r\n\tThe primary purposes of criminal contempt\r\n  are to preserve the courtâ€™s authority and to punish for disobedience of its\r\n  orders. Â If it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the\r\n  benefit of the complainant. Â But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is\r\n  punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.\r\n\tAn unconditional penalty is criminal in\r\n  nature because it is solely and exclusively punitive in nature.Â  The relief cannot\r\n  undo or remedy what has been done nor afford any compensation and the contemnor\r\n  cannot shorten the term by promising not to repeat his offense. Â If the relief\r\n  provided is a sentence of imprisonment,Â  . . . it is punitive if the sentence\r\n  is limited to imprisonment for a definite period. Â If the sanction is a fine,\r\n  it is punitive when it is paid to the court. Â However, a fine that is payable\r\n  to the court may be remedial when the contemnor can avoid paying the fine\r\n  simply by performing the affirmative act required by the courtâ€™s order.\r\n\tIn civil contempt cases, the sanctions\r\n  are conditioned on compliance with the courtâ€™s order. Â The conditional nature\r\n  of the punishment renders the relief civil in nature because the contemnor can\r\n  end the sentence and discharge himself at any moment by doing what he had\r\n  previously refused to do. Â If the relief provided is a sentence of\r\n  imprisonment, it is remedial if the defendant stands committed unless and until\r\n  he performs the affirmative act required by the courtâ€™s order . . . . Â Those\r\n  who are imprisoned until they obey the order, carry the keys of their prison in\r\n  their own pockets.Â  If the sanction is a fine, it is remedial and civil if paid\r\n  to the complainant even though the contemnor has no opportunity to purge\r\n  himself of the fine or if the contemnor can avoid the fine by complying with\r\n  the courtâ€™s order.\r\n\r\n365 S.C. 56, 75-76, 615 S.E.2d 465,\r\n  475-76 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Â Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 111-12,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 86, 88-89 (1998)).\r\nThe distinction between civil and criminal\r\n  contempt is critical, because criminal contempt triggers additional constitutional\r\n  safeguards.Â  Civil contempt must be proved by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence.Â  Durlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 71, 596\r\n  S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004).Â  In a criminal contempt proceeding, the burden\r\n  of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Floyd, 365 S.C. at 76, 615 S.E.2d at 76. Â Intent for purposes of criminal contempt is subjective, not\r\n  objective, and must necessarily be ascertained from all the acts, words, and\r\n  circumstances surrounding the occurrence.Â  State v. Passmore, 363 S.C.\r\n  568, 572, 611 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v.\r\n    Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994)).\r\nIn Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968)\r\n  the Supreme Court held prosecutions for serious criminal contempts are subject\r\n  to the jury trial protections of the Sixth Amendment.Â  Subsequently, in Codispoti\r\n    v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506, (1974), the Supreme Court held criminal\r\n  defendants sentence to imprisonment of more than six (6) months are entitled to\r\n  a jury trial. Â See Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 383, 287 S.E.2d\r\n  915, 918 (1982); Passmore, 363 S.C. at 572,\r\n  611 S.E.2d at 275.  \r\nâ€œIncarceration\r\n  under certain factual circumstances may be included as a component of civil\r\n  contempt.â€Â  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 609, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 514, 521 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, unlike the constitutional protection\r\n  afforded a criminal contemnor, the United States Supreme Court has held that a\r\n  civil contempt proceeding resulting in incarceration does not require a jury\r\n  trial. Â Shillitani v. U.S., 384 U.S. 364 (1966). Â In Shillitani,\r\n  two witnesses refused to testify before a grand jury after being given\r\n  immunity. Â 384 U.S. at 365.Â  They were sentenced to two years imprisonment for\r\n  contempt of court with the provision for release if they answered the grand\r\n  juryâ€™s questions.Â  Id.Â  The court reasoned the character and purpose of\r\n  the contempt rendered it civil rather than criminal.Â  Id. at 368. Â The\r\n  sentence of imprisonment was conditional, imposed for the obvious purpose of\r\n  compelling the two grand jury witnesses to obey the courtâ€™s orders to testify.Â  Id. at 370.Â  â€œWhile any imprisonment has punitive and deterrent\r\n  effects, it must be viewed as remedial if the court conditions the release upon\r\n  the contemnorâ€™s willingness to [obey a courtâ€™s order].â€Â  Id. â€œThe\r\n  conditional nature of the imprisonment, based entirely upon the contemnorâ€™s\r\n  continued defiance, justified holding civil contempt proceedings absent the\r\n  safeguards of indictment and a jury.â€Â  Id. at 370-71.\r\nIn Curlee v. Howle our supreme court followed\r\n  the Shillitani test to determine whether a jury trial was warranted in a\r\n  contempt proceeding.Â  277 S.C. at 382, 287 S.E.2d at 917.Â  A father who willfully\r\n  disregarded a family court order was sentenced to one year of confinement,\r\n  suspended upon paying the mother $14,960.43. Â Id. Â The court first asked\r\n  whether the contempt was civil or criminal.Â  Looking to the purpose of the\r\n  contempt finding, it was obviously to compel the contemnor to pay the expenses,\r\n  not punishment.Â  The court concluded â€œthe conditional nature of the\r\n  imprisonment, based entirely upon [the father]â€™s refusal to pay [the mother]â€™s\r\n  expenses, justified holding the civil contempt proceeding without a jury\r\n  trial.â€Â Â  Â \r\nC.Â Â The Case Sub Judice\r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s findings are\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  Specifically, Husband contends there is no\r\n  evidence that he willfully violated the terms of the Temporary Order by barring\r\n  Wife from entering the marital home, preventing her from retrieving her\r\n  belongings, and secreting her belongings in another location.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Husband alleges the family court erred in ordering Husband to return the Ford\r\n  Mustang and all its parts to Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\t1.Â Â Marital Property\r\n\r\nThe record clearly reflects Husbandâ€™s contemptuous\r\n  conduct.Â  The Temporary Order allowed and required Wife to remove all marital property from the marital home.Â  The Order unequivocally stated: â€œ[Wife] will remove all remaining property from the former\r\n  residence, to prepare it for sale, and she will store such property at her\r\n  residence.â€ Â \r\nWife and two witnesses attested to the fact\r\n  Husband willfully interfered with Wifeâ€™s attempts to effectuate the Temporary\r\n  Order.Â  Evidence showed the Husband had moved back into the marital home,\r\n  changed locks, and thwarted Wifeâ€™s scheduled entry to remove remaining property\r\n  as ordered.Â  When Wife eventually gained access to the marital home, she\r\n  discovered the remaining property, including the vintage Ford Mustang, had been\r\n  removed.Â   \r\nHusband does not dispute the existence of a valid\r\n  court order requiring Wife to remove remaining property.Â  He claims, instead,\r\n  that the Temporary Order is unclear, ambiguous, and did not specifically\r\n  prohibit him from removing property from the marital home.Â  Referring to the\r\n  relevant provisions of the Temporary Order, the family court reasoned â€œitâ€™s\r\n  obvious that property was to be there and all other property other than whatâ€™s\r\n  set forth here was to be at that house and sheâ€™s to take possession of it.â€Â \r\n  â€œAs to the personal property, it is explicit and unequivocal that the wife was\r\n  to be allowed to retrieve it, she was to get it all.â€Â   \r\nHusband denied he took any of Wifeâ€™s property to Savannah, Georgia.Â  He attributed the removal of Wifeâ€™s property to people helping him move\r\n  out of the marital home at the end of November.Â  However, Husband did\r\n  intentionally relocate the Ford Mustang to another location.Â  He insisted the\r\n  provision in the Temporary Order requiring that â€œ[e]ach\r\n  party will keep the vehicle in his or her respective possession and pay the\r\n  expenses of said vehiclesâ€ permitted his moving the automobile.  \r\nThe 1970 Mach I Ford\r\n  Mustang was basically a chassis, without the engine parts, in the process of\r\n  being restored.Â  Though at the time of the Temporary Order Husband was not\r\n  living in the marital home where the automobile was stored, he, nevertheless,\r\n  claimed possession of all body and interior parts.Â  Wife, on the other hand,\r\n  maintained the vehicle was part of the â€œremaining propertyâ€ that she was\r\n  ordered to retrieve and store.Â   \r\nHusband\r\n  urges the language of the Temporary Order does not accurately reflect the\r\n  record of the temporary hearing.Â  He claims the agreement at the hearing was\r\n  that Wife would remove remaining â€œfurnishings,â€ not â€œremaining property.â€Â \r\n  Husband relies on this discrepancy to argue the Ford Mustang was not part of\r\n  the property Wife was required to retrieve.Â  However, this argument is not\r\n  preserved.Â  Husband failed to address the discrepancy between the language at\r\n  the temporary hearing and in the Order in a post-trial motion.Â  A party must\r\n  make a post-trial motion where there are inaccuracies in the order or\r\n  inconsistencies between an oral ruling and a written order.Â  Grant v. South\r\n    Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 355, 461 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1995); Pelican\r\n      Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, Inc. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 60, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 673, 675 (1993) (appellant waived issue of nonconformity between oral\r\n  order and subsequent written order by failing to raise issue below, which could\r\n  have been raised through motion to alter or amend judgment after receipt of\r\n  allegedly nonconforming written order).\r\nThe\r\n  family court ruled the Ford Mustang was included in the remaining property Wife\r\n  was to remove and ordered Husband to return the Ford Mustang and all its parts\r\n  to Wife.Â  It is without dispute that the Ford Mustang was stored in the garage\r\n  of the marital home at the time of the Temporary Order and neither party was in\r\n  possession of it.Â  Nor was the Ford Mustang the type of operating vehicle\r\n  described in the Temporary Order that was to be maintained and insured by each\r\n  party.Â   \r\nOur sole purpose in reviewing the\r\n  family courtâ€™s contempt finding here is to ascertain whether evidentiary\r\n  support existed for the ruling.Â  Accordingly, after a thorough study of the\r\n  record, we determine evidentiary support existed for finding Husband in\r\n  contempt and for ordering him to return the Ford Mustang to Wife. The family\r\n  court was entirely within its discretion in determining the creditability of\r\n  the witnesses and in assigning weight to their testimony. Â \r\nMoreover, because the family court\r\n  determined Husband prevented Wife from retrieving the remaining property, the\r\n  family court did not err in failing to find Wife in contempt for her\r\n  non-compliance with the Temporary Order.Â  When a party is unable through no\r\n  fault of her own to obey an order of the court, she is not to be held in\r\n  contempt.\r\n\r\n\t2.Â Criminal Contempt\r\n  Finding\r\n\r\nHusband next complains the family\r\n  court erred in finding him in criminal contempt.Â  In the Amended Order the\r\n  family court ruled Husbandâ€™s â€œact of removalâ€ and â€œact of barringâ€ Wife\r\n  constituted criminal contempt that was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  The\r\n  family court ordered Husband to return Wifeâ€™s property.Â  His failure to do so\r\n  would result in a sentence of twelve (12) months incarceration, with the\r\n  provision that he would be â€œreleased by the return of such property.â€Â   \r\nThe family court committed an error\r\n  in nomenclature by designating the contempt criminal rather than civil. The precedent\r\n  emanating from the South Carolina and United States Supreme Courts\r\n  differentiating civil and criminal contempt is controlling.Â  See Curlee v. Howle, 277\r\n  S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 (1982); Shillitani v. U.S., 384 U.S. 364 (1966). \r\n \r\nWithout doubt, this is a civil\r\n  contempt proceeding.Â  The family courtâ€™s Amended Order does not subject Husband\r\n  to an unconditional, fixed term of imprisonment.[3]Â \r\n  Husband, if imprisoned, could obtain his release by complying with the courtâ€™s\r\n  directive; he held the keys to his prison.Â  The contempt ruling was obviously\r\n  intended to compel Husbandâ€™s compliance with the requirements of the Temporary\r\n  Order.Â  Although mistakenly referred to as criminal contempt, substantively,\r\n  the family courtâ€™s finding of contempt was civil in nature.Â   \r\nII.Â ATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in ordering him to\r\n  pay two-thirds (2/3) of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees because Wife did not prevail in\r\n  the majority of issues.Â  Additionally, Husband contends the family court erred\r\n  in failing to consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective financial\r\n  conditions, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of\r\n  living.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn advancing his\r\n  argument, Husband incorrectly applies the standard for award of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  in a domestic action.Â  In this contempt action, however, a different standard\r\n  controls the courtâ€™s analysis.Â   \r\nCourts, by exercising\r\n  their contempt power, can award attorneyâ€™s fees under a compensatory contempt\r\n  theory. Â Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 178-79,\r\n  557 S.E.2d 708, 711-12 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Compensatory contempt seeks to\r\n  reimburse the party for the costs it incurs in forcing the non-complying party\r\n  to obey the courtâ€™s orders. Â â€œIn a civil contempt proceeding, a contemnor may\r\n  be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred in enforcing\r\n  the courtâ€™s prior order, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees is not a punishment but an indemnification to the party who\r\n  instituted the contempt proceeding.â€Â  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106,\r\n  114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1998); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 345,\r\n  491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œA compensatory contempt award may include\r\n  attorney fees.â€); Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 386-87, 287 S.E.2d 915,\r\n  919-20 (1982) (â€œCompensatory contempt is a money award for the [Wife] when the\r\n  [Husband]Â  has injured the [Wife] by violating a previous court order . . . . Â Included\r\n  in the actual loss are the costs of defending and enforcing the courtâ€™s order,\r\n  including litigation costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.â€). Â The court is not required\r\n  to provide the contemnor with an opportunity to purge himself of these\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees in order to hold him in civil contempt.Â  Floyd v. Floyd,\r\n  365 S.C. 56, 76, 615 S.E.2d 465, 476 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Poston, 331\r\n  S.C. at 111-15, 502 S.E.2d at 88-91).Â  â€œ[T]he award of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  is not part of the punishment; instead, this award is made to indemnify the\r\n  party for expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of the court's order.â€Â  Id. at 77, 615 S.E. 2d at 476 (quoting Poston, 33 S.C. at 111-15, 502 S.E.2d\r\n  at 88-91).\r\nThe family court found\r\n  Wife necessarily incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in securing Husbandâ€™s\r\n  compliance with the Temporary Order.Â  We discern no abuse of discretion in\r\n  ordering Husband to pay a portion of those fees and costs. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION  \r\nWe hold the evidentiary\r\n  record supported the family courtâ€™s finding Husband in civil contempt.Â  The\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion by ordering Husband to return the\r\n  Ford Mustang and all parts to Wife.Â  Nor did the family court err in failing to\r\n  find Wife in civil contempt when she, through no fault of her own, failed to\r\n  comply with the Temporary Order. Â The family court considered the proper\r\n  standard for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees in a contempt action and was within its\r\n  discretion in awarding fees and costs to Wife.\r\nAccordingly, the Amended\r\n  Order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTHOMAS, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The family court addressed other issues not\r\n  relevant to this appeal, including the Temporary Orderâ€™s requirement that\r\n  Husband and Wife split the utility bills while the home was on the market. \r\n \r\n[3] Although the family court issued several\r\n  contempt rulings and imposed somewhat confusing sentences at the conclusion of\r\n  the contempt hearing, the final ruling in the Amended Order controls.Â  â€œIt is\r\n  well settled that a judge is not bound by a prior oral ruling and may issue a\r\n  written order which is in conflict with the oral ruling.â€ Â Corbin v.

Rice\r\n  (Rice) was convicted of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to life plus\r\n  thirty years, concurrent.Â  Rice challenges her conviction, claiming the trial\r\n  court erred by (1) ruling the portion of a prior inconsistent statement\r\n  concerning third-party guilt inadmissible; (2) admitting alleged hearsay\r\n  testimony; (3) permitting an in-court identification; (4) admitting business\r\n  records under Rule 803(6), SCRE; and (5) failing to issue a curative\r\n  instruction following the Stateâ€™s closing argument.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the\r\n  evening of October 25, 2001, Carmen Rice and Iris Bryant (Bryant) joined Bernard\r\n  Brennan (Brennan) at the Varsity in Columbia, where Brennan was playing pool\r\n  with his friend, Alton Page.Â  Brennan told Page one of the women was his cousin\r\n  from New York and the other was her friend from Beaufort.Â  Eventually, Brennan,\r\n  Rice, and Bryant went to Callowayâ€™s to eat.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  their meal, Brennan and the two women left Callowayâ€™s together.Â  They drove in\r\n  his Mercedes to an isolated section of Richland County, near the intersection\r\n  of Fairfield Road and Interstate 20.Â   \r\nLater\r\n  that night, Deputy Tom Lyons found Brennanâ€™s Mercedes in a ditch on Crawford Road.Â  Brennan was still buckled in his seatbelt, the engine was running, and the\r\n  vehicle was in gear.Â  Brennan had been shot five times in the back and died as\r\n  a result of the shooting.Â  His wallet was missing.\r\nThe\r\n  police learned Bryant was involved in the murder and robbery after receiving\r\n  information from one of Bryantâ€™s friends. Â Bryant subsequently implicated\r\n  Rice in the murder and robbery.Â   \r\nIn her\r\n  testimony at Riceâ€™s trial, Bryant confirmed she and Rice had planned to rob\r\n  Brennan but denied any complicity in a plan to murder him.Â  Bryant claimed Rice\r\n  unexpectedly shot Brennan from the backseat with the weapon Rice was issued by\r\n  her employer. Â After the shooting, Rice removed Brennanâ€™s wallet and wiped down\r\n  the car.Â  Then the two women fled.\r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, Bryant had given investigators multiple statements implicating other\r\n  individuals in the robbery and murder. Â At Riceâ€™s trial, she confessed she lied\r\n  in those previous interviews because she was afraid she would be charged with\r\n  murder if she admitted being at the crime scene.Â  Rice attempted to impeach\r\n  Bryantâ€™s testimony with a prior inconsistent statement Bryant made to Alana Quattlebaum, a fellow prisoner.Â  The import of Bryantâ€™s statement to Quattlebaum\r\n  was that a woman named Nikki, rather than Rice, actually killed Brennan. [1]Â Â  \r\n \r\nBrennanâ€™s friend, Alton Page, testified he could not identify\r\n  either of the individuals he saw with Brennan on the night of the murder, but\r\n  he recalled that one of them wore a â€œbright orange top.â€Â   \r\nHeidi Feagin was a waitress at Callowayâ€™s in October of 2001.Â \r\n  Feagin served Brennan and the two women on October 25, and recognized Brennan\r\n  as a â€œregular customer.â€Â  She described one of the women as having a stocky or\r\n  medium build and wearing a bright orange top.Â  The other woman was thinner and\r\n  younger.Â  Before trial, Feagin was shown a photographic lineup of six women.Â \r\n  The array included only Bryantâ€™s photograph.Â  Feagin did not identify Bryant,\r\n  but instead selected two other women as Brennanâ€™s companions.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  investigation ultimately led to Riceâ€™s indictment and trial for the armed\r\n  robbery and murder of Bernard Brennan.Â  The jury returned a verdict of guilty\r\n  and Rice was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and thirty years,\r\n  concurrent, for armed robbery.Â  At the time of Riceâ€™s trial, Bryant had been\r\n  charged with murder and armed robbery.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err by ruling a prior inconsistent Â  statement\r\n  concerning third-party guilt inadmissible?\r\n\t2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err by\r\n  admitting hearsay testimony?\r\n\t3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err by permitting an\r\n  in-court identification that was\r\n  allegedly unreliable?\r\n\t4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err by admitting business\r\n  records under Rule 803(6), SCRE, that were untrustworthy?\r\n\t5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err by failing to give the\r\n  jury an instruction curing the prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  improper comment in closing? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525,\r\n  608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004). Â We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual\r\n  findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Â State v. Quattlebaum, 338\r\n  S.C. 441, 454, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000); State v. Williams, 326 S.C.\r\n  130, 135, 485 S.E.2d 99, 102&nbsp;(1997); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 224, 625 S.E.2d 239, 241 (Ct. App. 2006) cert.\r\n    pending; State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004). Â This court does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Â Wilson, 345 S.C. at 1, 545\r\n  S.E.2d at 827; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 583, 575 S.E.2d 852, 855\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nI.Â  Admission of Evidence\r\nThe\r\n  admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Â State\r\n    v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000); State\r\n      v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 228, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999). Â Evidentiary\r\n  rulings of the trial court will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the\r\n  defendant. Â Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 77, 538 S.E.2d at 263.\r\nOn appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial court\r\n  abused its discretion. Â State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 506, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  59, 63 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Walker, 366 S.C.\r\n  643, 653, 623 S.E.2d 122, 127 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is\r\n  without evidentiary support. Â Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg,\r\n  363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005); see also Simon v.\r\n    Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 550, 99 S.E.2d 391, 393-94 (1957) (â€œ â€˜[E]rror at\r\n  lawâ€™ exists: (1) when the circuit judge, in issuing [the order], was controlled\r\n  by some error of lawÂ  . . . or (2) where the order, based upon factual, as\r\n  distinguished from legal, considerations, is without adequate evidentiary\r\n  support.â€); McSween v. Windham, 77 S.C. 223, 226, 57 S.E. 847, 848\r\n  (1907) (â€œ[T]he determination of the [trial] court will not be interfered with,\r\n  unless there is an abuse of discretion, or unless the exercise of discretion\r\n  was controlled by some error of law.â€).Â   \r\nII. Closing Arguments\r\nA trial court is\r\n  vested with broad discretion in dealing with the range of propriety of closing\r\n  argument, and ordinarily its rulings on such matters will not be disturbed.Â  State\r\n    v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 195-96, 562 S.E.2d 320, 325-26&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  This court will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling regarding closing argument unless the trial court commits an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624\r\n  (1996); State v. Jernigan, 156 S.C. 509, 524, 153 S.E. 480, 486 (1930). Â An\r\n  appellate court must review the argument in the context of the entire record.Â  State\r\n    v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766&nbsp;(1997).Â   \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The relevant\r\n  question is whether the prosecutorâ€™s comments so infected the trial with\r\n  unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  Id. Â Once the trial court has allowed the argument to\r\n  stand, the defendant has the burden of proving the argument denied him a fair\r\n  determination of guilt or innocence. Â State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 580,\r\n  300 S.E.2d 63, 68 (1982).Â  Improper comments on closing do not require reversal if the\r\n  appellant fails to prove he did not receive a fair trial because of the alleged\r\n  improper argument.Â  Randall v. State, 356 S.C. 639, 642, 591 S.E.2d 608,\r\n  610 (2004).Â  To\r\n  warrant reversal, the appellant must prove both abuse of discretion and\r\n  resulting prejudice.Â  State v.\r\n    Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 231, 589 S.E.2d\r\n  1, 3 (2003); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 232, 625 S.E.2d 245, 239\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006) cert pending; State v. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165,\r\n  172, 539 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Hughey, 339 S.C.\r\n  439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000)); State v. Sierra, 337 S.C. 368, 373, 523\r\n  S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Harmless\r\n  Error\r\nThe\r\n  commission of legal error is harmless if it does not result in prejudice to the\r\n  defendant.Â  For the error to be harmless,\r\n  we must determine â€œbeyond a reasonable doubt the error complained of did not\r\n  contribute to the verdict obtained.â€Â  Taylor v State, 312 S.C. 179, 181,\r\n  439 S.E.2d 820, 821 (1993) (citing Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992)); State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 247, 534\r\n  S.E.2d 15, 18 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Andrews, 324 S.C. 516,\r\n  479 S.E.2d 808, 812 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  â€œ[A]n insubstantial error not affecting\r\n  the result of the trial is harmless where â€˜guilt has been conclusively proven\r\n  by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€™ â€ State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 212, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006) (quoting State\r\n    v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989)); State v. Adams,\r\n  354 S.C. 361, 381, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 179, 460 S.E.2d 368, 371\r\n  (1995) (noting this court will not set aside a conviction for insubstantial\r\n  errors not affecting the result when guilt is conclusively proven by competent\r\n  evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached).  \r\nâ€œError is harmless\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained.â€Â  Pagan, 369 S.C. at 212, 631 S.E.2d at 267 (citing Arnold, 309 S.C. at 172, 420\r\n  S.E.2d at 842); State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318-19\r\n  (2002); State v. Sherard, 303 S.C.\r\n  172, 175, 399 S.E.2d 595, 596 (1991) (â€œError in a criminal prosecution is\r\n  harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€).Â \r\n  â€œAn error is not reversible unless it is material and prejudicial to the\r\n  substantial rights of the appellant.â€Â  Visual Graphics Leasing Corp., Inc. v\r\n    Lucia, 311 S.C. 484, 489, 429 S.E.2d 839, 841 (Ct. App. 1993).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Third-Party\r\n  Guilt Under Holmes v. South Carolina\r\nRice\r\n  contends the trial court erred in ruling inadmissible portions of the prior\r\n  inconsistent statement Bryant made to Quattlebaum suggesting evidence of third-party\r\n  guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tA.Â Â Â Â Â  Issue\r\n  Preservation\r\n\r\nAt the outset, we question whether the issue regarding\r\n  third-party guilt is preserved for our review.Â  When initially raised, trial\r\n  counsel specifically stated, â€œIâ€™m not going to argue third-party guilt that\r\n  this other person did itâ€ and â€œI donâ€™t plan to argue third-party guilt.â€Â  Trial\r\n  counsel stated he was offering the evidence solely to impeach Bryantâ€™s\r\n  testimony.Â  The trial court opined the statement suggested third-party\r\n  guilt and asked trial counsel, â€œI assume no other evidence related toâ€ the\r\n  third party other than this statement is going to be presented.Â  Trial counsel offered\r\n  nothing further.Â  Consequently, the trial court did not analyze third-party\r\n  guilt in depth or rule on the issue.Â   \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B.Â Â Â Â Â  Impeachment\r\n  by Prior Inconsistent Statement Containing Evidence\r\n  of Third-Party Guilt \r\nRule\r\n  801(d)(1), SCRE provides that a prior statement by a witness is not hearsay and\r\n  is admissible ifÂ  â€œ[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is\r\n  subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is inconsistent\r\n  with the declarantâ€™s testimony . . . .â€Â  â€œA prior inconsistent statement is\r\n  admissible as substantive evidence when the declarant testifies at trial and is\r\n  subject to cross-examination.â€ Â State v. Caulder, 287 S.C. 507, 513, 339\r\n  S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1986) (citing State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572,\r\n  581, 300 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1982)).\r\nHowever,\r\n  in this case the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement containing substantive\r\n  evidence of third-party guilt requires further scrutiny.Â  Our state supreme court\r\n  has imposed strict limitations on the admissibility of testimony indicating\r\n  third-party guilt.Â  See State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66,\r\n  81, 538 S.E.2d 257, 265 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Evidence offered by a defendant as to\r\n  the commission of the crime by another person is limited to facts which are\r\n  inconsistent with the defendantâ€™s guilt. Id.Â  The evidence must raise a\r\n  reasonable inference as to the accusedâ€™s innocence.Â  Id.Â   \r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s law concerning the admissibility of third-party guilt evidence was articulated\r\n  in State v. Gregory:\r\n\r\n\t[E]vidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare\r\n  suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the\r\n  commission of the crime by another, is not admissible. . . .Â  But before such\r\n  testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such\r\n  a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other\r\n  person as the guilty party. Â Remote acts, disconnected and outside the crime\r\n  itself, cannot be separately proved for such a purpose. Â An orderly and\r\n  unbiased judicial inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant on trial\r\n  does not contemplate that such defendant be permitted, by way of defense, to\r\n  indulge in conjectural inferences that some other person might have committed\r\n  the offense for which he is on trial, or by fanciful analogy to say to the jury\r\n  that someone other than he is more probably guilty.\r\n\r\n198 S.C. 98,\r\n  104-05, 16 S.E.2d 532, 534-35 (1941); accord State v. Cooper, 334\r\n  S.C. 540, 549-50, 514 S.E.2d 584, 588 (1999); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C.\r\n  405, 427-29, 578 S.E.2d 32, 44-45 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the testimony is\r\n  inadmissible as substantive evidence of third-party guilt, it may,\r\n  nevertheless, still be admissible for impeachment purposes. Â See Cooper,\r\n  334 S.C. at 549-50, 514 S.E.2d at 588 (citing State v. Fossick, 333 S.C.\r\n  66, 69, 508 S.E.2d 32, 33 n.1 (1998)).  \r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court examined and clarified the rule announced in Gregory in its review of State v. Holmes, 361 S.C. 333, 605 S.E.2d 19 (2004).Â  Holmes\r\n    v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 126 S. Ct. 1727 (2006).Â  Holmes was\r\n  convicted in state circuit court of murder, first degree burglary, first degree\r\n  criminal sexual conduct, and robbery.Â  He received a death sentence.Â  State\r\n    v. Holmes, 361 S.C. at 335, 605 S.E.2d at 20.Â  Holmes appealed, contending the\r\n  trial court erred in excluding evidence of third-party guilt.Â  Id. at 339, 605 S.E.2d at 22.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court, referencing the Gregory rule, found no error in the exclusion.Â  Id. at 343, 605 S.E.2d at 24.Â \r\n  In addition, the Court cited State v. Gay, 343 S.C. 543, 545, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  541, 550 (2001), and announced that â€œwhere there is strong evidence of an\r\n  appellantâ€™s guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the\r\n  proffered evidence about a third partyâ€™s alleged guilt does not raise a\r\n  reasonable inference as to the appellantâ€™s own innocence.â€ Â Id. Â Applying\r\n  the Gay standard, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the circuit\r\n  court and held Holmes could not â€œovercome the forensic evidence against him to\r\n  raise a reasonable inference of his own innocence.â€ Â Id.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court vacated and remanded the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Courtâ€™s decision.Â  Holmes, 547 U.S. 319, ___, 126 S. Ct. 1727, 1735.Â  In\r\n  doing so, Justice Alito explained the South Carolina Supreme Court radically\r\n  changed and extended the State v. Gregory rule by applying the\r\n  additional rule from State v. Gay:\r\n\r\n\tIn Gay, after recognizing the standard applied in \r\n\tGregory,\r\n  the [South Carolina] court stated that â€œ[i]n view of the strong evidence of\r\n  appellantâ€™s guilt-especially the forensic evidence . . . Â the proffered\r\n  evidence . . . did not raise â€˜a reasonable inferenceâ€™ as to appellantâ€™s own\r\n  innocence.â€Â  Similarly, in the present case, as noted, the State Supreme Court\r\n  applied the rule that where there is strong evidence of [a defendantâ€™s] guilt,\r\n  especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about\r\n  a third partyâ€™s alleged guilt may (or perhaps must) be excluded. \r\n\tUnder this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative\r\n  value or the potential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of\r\n  third-party guilt. Â Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s case: If the prosecutionâ€™s case is strong enough, the evidence of\r\n  third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed independently,\r\n  would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of\r\n  harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.\r\n\tFurthermore, as applied in this case, the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Courtâ€™s rule seems to call for little, if any, examination of the credibility\r\n  of the prosecutionâ€™s witnesses or the reliability of its evidence. Â Here, for\r\n  example, the defense strenuously claimed that the prosecutionâ€™s forensic\r\n  evidence was so unreliable (due to mishandling and a deliberate plot to frame\r\n  petitioner) that the evidence should not have even been admitted. Â The South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court responded that these challenges did not entirely\r\n  â€œeviscerateâ€ the forensic evidence and that the defense challenges went to the\r\n  weight and not to the admissibility of that evidence. Â Yet, in evaluating the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s forensic evidence and deeming it to be â€œstrongâ€-and thereby justifying\r\n  exclusion of petitionerâ€™s third-party guilt evidence-the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court made no mention of the defense challenges to the prosecutionâ€™s evidence.\r\n\tInterpreted in this way, the rule applied by the State Supreme\r\n  Court does not rationally serve the end that the Gregory rule and its\r\n  analogues in other jurisdictions were designed to promote, i.e., to focus the\r\n  trial on the central issues by excluding evidence that has only a very weak\r\n  logical connection to the central issues. Â The rule applied in this case appears\r\n  to be based on the following logic: Where (1) it is clear that only one person\r\n  was involved in the commission of a particular crime and (2) there is strong\r\n  evidence that the defendant was the perpetrator, it follows that evidence of\r\n  third-party guilt must be weak. Â But this logic depends on an accurate\r\n  evaluation of the prosecutionâ€™s proof, and the true strength of the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s proof cannot be assessed without considering challenges to the\r\n  reliability of the prosecutionâ€™s evidence.Â  Just because the prosecutionâ€™s\r\n  evidence, if credited, would provide strong support for a guilty verdict, it\r\n  does not follow that evidence of third-party guilt has only a weak logical\r\n  connection to the central issues in the case. Â And where the credibility of the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s witnesses or the reliability of its evidence is not conceded, the\r\n  strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case cannot be assessed without making the sort\r\n  of factual findings that have traditionally been reserved for the trier of fact\r\n  and that the South Carolina courts did not purport to make in this case.\r\n\tÂ . . . \r\n\tThe point is that, by evaluating the strength of only one partyâ€™s\r\n  evidence, no logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of\r\n  contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt. Â Because\r\n  the rule applied by the State Supreme Court in this case did not heed this\r\n  point, the rule is â€œarbitraryâ€ in the sense that it does not rationally serve\r\n  the end that the Gregory rule and other similar third-party guilt rules\r\n  were designed to further. Â Nor has the State identified any other legitimate\r\n  end that the rule serves. \r\n\r\nHolmes, 547 U.S. at ___, 126 S. Ct. at 1733-35 (internal quotations and citations omitted) abrogating State v.\r\n  Gay, 343 S.C. 543, 541 S.E.2d 541 (2001).Â  The Holmes court concluded\r\n  the rule applied in State v. Holmes violated a criminal defendantâ€™s\r\n  right to â€œ â€˜ a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.â€™ â€ Id. (citing Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986)).\r\nDespite previously professing intentions not to argue third-party\r\n  guilt, Rice raised the issue again after Quattlebaum\r\n  testified, citing State v. Holmes, 605 S.E.2d 19, 361 S.C. 333 (2004).[2]Â  Rice attempted to introduce evidence implicating Tiki by showing that a\r\n  composite sketch of the suspect identified as Rice looked remarkably like\r\n  Tiki.Â  In addition, Rice maintained Bryant previously named Nikki as the\r\n  murderer.\r\nThe trial\r\n  court found the evidence failed to meet the standard in State v. Holmes or the â€œlong line of casesâ€ addressing third-party guilt. Â Accordingly, Quattlebaum could relate only\r\n  that Bryant told her it was not Rice who had committed the crime.Â  Quattlebaum was\r\n  specifically prohibited from testifying that Bryant said Nikki (or Tiki) killed\r\n  Brennan.Â  The trial court concluded:  \r\n\r\n\t[A]s part of a defendantâ€™s defense, it is not proper to just raise\r\n  this, well somebody else could have done it . . . unless you have a specific\r\n  chain of facts and circumstances to satisfy the standards for third-party\r\n  evidence . . . .\r\n\t[T]hese inferences in front of the jury about some third person\r\n  and vague references like that are specifically whatâ€™s prohibited and itâ€™s been\r\n  ruled not to be a part of a defendantâ€™s constitutional rights to maintain their\r\n  innocence on something as to point vaguely to some third person. . . .\r\n\tYou can impeach a witness and thatâ€™s not the issue.Â  The issue is,\r\n  [sic] is whether you can bring up this third person who is not in front of the\r\n  jury other than in this vague way.Â  And there is, as I understand from defense\r\n  counsel, no other evidence creating a chain of circumstances in facts that\r\n  would indicate third-party guilt. . . .\r\n\tIâ€™ll let you ask her if she ever made the statement that it wasnâ€™t\r\n  her [Rice], but without getting into this issue that it was somebody else who\r\n  did it. \r\n\r\nThe trial\r\n  court adhered to the Gregory rule and applied the proper standard for\r\n  admission of third-party guilt evidenceâ€”there must be such proof of connection\r\n  with the crime, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to\r\n  point out such other person as the guilty party.Â  The evidence Rice asserted in\r\n  support of introducing the third-party guilt testimony implicated Nikki at\r\n  times, and Tiki at times, with no clarification as to whether they were the\r\n  same individual.Â  The\r\n  record is void of facts or circumstances, other than Bryantâ€™s inconsistent\r\n  statements, linking anyone other than Rice to Brennanâ€™s murder.Â  The proffered\r\n  evidence casts a mere â€œbare suspicionâ€ on Nikki or Tiki and fails to connect\r\n  either to the murder by way of the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\n  crime.\r\nMoreover, any error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling was harmless.Â  Quattlebaum\r\n  confirmed that Bryantâ€™s prior statement: (1) indicated Rice had nothing to do\r\n  with Brennanâ€™s murder; and (2) was inconsistent with Bryantâ€™s trial testimony, thus\r\n  impeaching her truthfulness, as defense counsel had originally intended.Â \r\n  Additionally, the jury heard multiple times from Bryant on direct and\r\n  cross-examination that she, at one point, told police Nikki had been involved\r\n  in the murder.Â  The trial court appropriately permitted Quattlebaumâ€™s testimony\r\n  about Bryantâ€™s prior statement, tailored for impeachment purposes only, and excluded\r\n  the portion of the statement that substantively pointed to the guilt of a third\r\n  party.Â   \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Hearsay \r\nRice\r\n  argues that an investigating officerâ€™s testimony about Riceâ€™s objection to being\r\n  fingerprinted was inadmissible hearsay.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nInitially, we note this issue is likely not preserved.Â \r\n  Trial counsel did not object when Officer Smith made the alleged hearsay\r\n  statement.Â  Instead, counsel made a motion to strike stating, â€œHeâ€™s talking\r\n  about what someone else did.â€Â  Unless an objection is made at the time the\r\n  evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved for\r\n  review. Â State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 42, 479\r\n  S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996).Â  Furthermore, an\r\n  objection must be on a specific ground.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111,\r\n  120, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997); State v. New, 338 S.C. 313, 318, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 237, 239 (Ct. App. 1999). Â A general objection which does not specify\r\n  the particular ground on which the objection is based is insufficient to\r\n  preserve a question for review. Â State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482\r\n  S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997). Â In order to preserve for review an alleged error, the\r\n  objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise\r\n  nature of the alleged error so it can be reasonably understood by the trial\r\n  court.Â  New, 338 S.C. at 318, 526 S.E.2d at 239; see also Campbell\r\n    v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 301 S.C. 448, 454, 392 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding\r\n  where the ground for objection is not stated in the record, there is no basis\r\n  for appellate review). Â \r\nRule 103(a)(1), SCRE, requires specificity where the\r\n  ground for objection is not apparent from the context of the discussion\r\n  contained in the record. Â New, 338 S.C. at 318, 526 S.E.2d at 239.Â \r\n  Here, trial counsel never actually made an objection, only a motion to strike.Â  The trial transcript reflects very little discussion\r\n  and does not make the ground for any objection apparent.Â  Trial counsel never raised\r\n  hearsay, and it appears more likely his concern was whether Officer Smithâ€™s\r\n  testimony was based on personal knowledge.Â  Because trial\r\n  counsel never objected and specified his concern with the testimony on the\r\n  record, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nRiceâ€™s argument fails on the merits as well.Â  Rule\r\n  801(c), SCRE, defines hearsay as â€œa statement, other than one made by the\r\n  declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to\r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  A statement is â€œ1) an oral or written\r\n  assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person\r\n  as an assertion.â€Â  Rule 801(a), SCRE.Â  â€œAn out of court statement by someone\r\n  other than the person testifying which is used to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted constitutes hearsay and is inadmissible unless it falls within an\r\n  exception.â€Â  Watson v. State, 370 S.C. 68, 71, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006)\r\n  (citing Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151, 156, 551 S.E.2d 260, 262 (2001)).Â \r\n  Conversely, a statement that is not offered to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted should not be excluded as hearsay.Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C.\r\n  56, 82, 615 S.E.2d 465, 479 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nThe leading case in South Carolina in regard to the\r\n  principle that general testimony in regard to a law enforcement investigation\r\n  is NOT hearsay is State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888 (1994).Â  Brown edifies:\r\n\r\n\tEvidence is not hearsay unless it is an\r\n  out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State\r\n    v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1103, 112 S. Ct. 1193, 117 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1992).Â  Additionally, an out of court statement is\r\n  not hearsay if it is offered for the limited purpose of explaining why a\r\n  government investigation was undertaken.Â  United States v. Love,\r\n  767 F.2d 1052 (1995), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1081, 106 S. Ct. 848, 849,\r\n  88 L. Ed. 2d 890 (1986).Â  Here, these statements were not entered for their\r\n  truth but rather to explain why the officers began their surveillance.Â  These\r\n  statements are not hearsay and, therefore, the trial judge committed no error\r\n  in allowing these statements into evidence.â€\r\n\r\nId. at 63, 451 S.E.2d at 894.\r\nAdditionally, the rule is elucidated in State v.\r\n  Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003), that testimony\r\n  concerning a statement from a bystander to the police was not hearsay because\r\n  it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to explain\r\n  and outline the investigation and the officerâ€™s reason for going to the\r\n  defendantâ€™s home.\r\nEvidence explaining why law enforcement is in a\r\n  particular area has been held to be relevant information for the jury to\r\n  consider.Â  State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 456 S.E.2d 442 (Ct. App. 1995); State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 56, 419 S.E.2d 820 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Weaver, we held the testimony of a police officer about conclusions he\r\n  made based on his investigation was not hearsay. Â 361 S.C. 73, 86, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  786, 792 (Ct. App. 2004) cert. granted, March 23, 2006.Â  Although the\r\n  officerâ€™s investigation included interviews with witnesses, the officer never\r\n  repeated any statements made to him by individuals at the crime scene.Â  Id.\r\nAs in Weaver,\r\n  the testimony of Officer Smith in this case is not hearsay. Â Officer Smith did\r\n  not testify as to what someone told him.Â  He simply related what he learned as\r\n  a result of his investigation:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAre you familiar with the efforts \r\n\t\t\tto take her fingerprints out at the jail prior to this for \r\n\t\t\tcomparison against the car&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tfingerprints?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid she voluntarily submit to \r\n\t\t\tthat?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tShe actually didnâ€™t, I believe, \r\n\t\t\tdidnâ€™t want to do it at first when one of our detectives went there \r\n\t\t\tto my understanding. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tWas he not present?&nbsp; If not, \r\n\t\t\tI move to strike his answer. Heâ€™s talking about what somebody else did.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt:\r\n\t\t\tYâ€™all have been asking him all \r\n\t\t\tday about other stuff everybody\r\n  else was doing.Â  Iâ€™m going to allow it. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tBased on your investigation as \r\n\t\t\tthe chief investigating&nbsp; officer\r\n  who is responsible, as [defense counsel] pointed out, for the actions of\r\n  those who investigated under you, did you learn as part of your\r\n  investigation, that she fought the fingerprinting?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tShe didnâ€™t want to do it and \r\n\t\t\tbasically was informed, you know, fingerprinting is something thatâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tâ€“they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comply \r\n\t\t\tto in custody, so she had to take it.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  hearsay rule does not require exclusion of testimony about what an\r\n  investigating officer learns from his investigation.Â  Because this testimony\r\n  did not constitute hearsay, its admission was not an abuse of discretion.Â  Even\r\n  if Officer Smith had repeated an out of court statement in court, the purpose\r\n  of the repetition, as the State noted, was not to prove the matter asserted, but\r\n  to suggest Riceâ€™s state of mind about surrendering her fingerprints.Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  event testimony is improperly admitted, the error is reversible only when the\r\n  admission causes prejudice.Â  State v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 499, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 363, 366 (2006).Â  If Smithâ€™s testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay,\r\n  the admission was harmless.Â  The information he provided only served to show Rice\r\n  did not want her fingerprints taken.Â  Nothing in the record indicates the prints\r\n  matched evidence found at the scene of the murder.Â  The challenged evidence was\r\n  non-prejudicial in light of its limited purpose of demonstrating that Rice did\r\n  not want to cooperate with the investigationâ€”not to prove that she committed\r\n  the crime.Â   \r\nIII.Â Â Â  In-Court\r\n  Identification\r\nRice alleges the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting Heidi Feaginâ€™s in-court identification, maintaining it was unreliable\r\n  and posed a substantial risk of misidentification.Â  Additionally, Rice\r\n  complained the trial court erred in finding defense counsel, through\r\n  cross-examination, opened the door allowing the State to elicit Feaginâ€™s\r\n  identification.Â  Both of Riceâ€™s contentions are without merit.  \r\nThe admission of eyewitness identification\r\n  is in the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of that discretion or the commission of prejudicial legal error.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 288, 540 S.E.2d\r\n  445, 448 (2000); State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 502, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nReliability\r\n  is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.Â  Id. at 504, 589 S.E.2d at 785 (citing Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977); State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 251, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe admissibility of an in-court identification is frequently\r\n  challenged by a criminal defendant on the grounds that a pre-trial\r\n  identification procedure was unduly suggestive.Â  See e.g., Moore, 343 S.C. at 286, 540 S.E.2d at 447 (â€œAn in-court identification of an\r\n  accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure\r\n  created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€).Â  In\r\n  those cases, the standard for determining the admissibility of both out-of-court\r\n  and in-court identifications is whether the identification procedure â€œwas so\r\n  impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of\r\n  irreparable misidentification.â€Â  State v. Gambrell, 274 S.C. 587, 590,\r\n  266 S.E.2d 78, 80 (1980).Â  A criminal defendant may be deprived of due process\r\n  of law by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive and\r\n  conducive to irreparable mistaken identification. Â State v. Mansfield, 343\r\n  S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nA court must consider the totality of circumstances to determine\r\n  whether an identification may be reliable even when the procedure has been\r\n  suggestive. Â See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199 (1972).Â  The\r\n  factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification\r\n  include: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the accused; (2) the\r\n  witnessâ€™ degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™ prior\r\n  description; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the\r\n  confrontation; and (5) the length of time between the crime and the\r\n  confrontation. Â Id.\r\nHowever,\r\n  the requirement that a court review the totality of circumstances to determine\r\n  whether an identification is reliable does not apply in the absence of a pre-trial\r\n  identification procedure.Â  State v. Lewis, 363 S.C. 37, 42, 609 S.E.2d\r\n  515, 518 (2005). Â In Lewis, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed\r\n  this courtâ€™s holding that â€œthe Neil v. Biggers analysis should not be\r\n  extended to protect criminal defendants against identifications that occur for\r\n  the first time in court without a pre-trial identification.â€Â  Lewis, 363\r\n  S.C. at 42, 609 S.E.2d at 518.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  discussing its reasoning, the Court explained, â€œthese extra safeguards\r\n  [afforded by a Neil v. Biggers analysis] are not applicable to an in-court\r\n  identification because the witnessâ€™ testimony is subject to the same rules of\r\n  evidence, witness credibility, and cross-examination as all testimony in a\r\n  criminal trial.â€Â  Lewis, 363 S.C. at 43, 609 S.E.2d at 518 (citing Ralston\r\n    v. State, 309 S.E.2d 135, 136 (1983)).\r\n\r\n\tAccordingly, we conclude Neil\r\n  v. Biggers does not apply to a first-time in-court\r\n  identification because the judge is present and can adequately address relevant\r\n  problems; the jury is physically present to witness the identification, rather\r\n  than merely hearing testimony about it; and cross-examination offers defendants\r\n  an adequate safeguard or remedy against suggestive examinations.\r\n\r\nLewis, 363\r\n  S.C. at 43, 609 S.E.2d at 518.\r\nA\r\n  diligent search of the evidentiary record reveals no evidence whatsoever of a\r\n  witness identification involving Rice prior to Feaginâ€™s in-court\r\n  identification.Â  The extant record convinces the court of the vivacity and\r\n  applicability of the Lewis rule to the case sub judice.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nHere,\r\n  the witness only identified Rice at trial, not at any time prior to trial.Â \r\n  Therefore, the factors provided by Neil do not apply.Â  The protections\r\n  needed from suggestive pretrial identifications are not necessary in an\r\n  in-court identification because of cross-examination and argument.Â  Rice had\r\n  the opportunity to cross-examine Feagin regarding her in-court identification.Â \r\n  This was the proper remedy.Â  The trial court did not err when it allowed the\r\n  witness to make an in-court identification of Rice.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the record fully supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the question of whether\r\n  defense counsel â€œopened the doorâ€ to allow Feaginâ€™s identification.  \r\nSouth Carolina precedent has firmly established that otherwise inadmissible evidence may be\r\n  properly admitted when opposing counsel â€œopens the doorâ€ to that evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Young, 364 S.C. 476, 485, 613 S.E.2d 386, 391 (Ct. App. 2005) cert.\r\n      granted, Jan. 2007; see also State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622,\r\n  632, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004) (â€œGiven that [defendants] maintained that PPS did\r\n  not allow pornographic materials or links on the website, it is patent that\r\n  they opened the door to this line of inquiry.â€); State v. White, 361\r\n  S.C. 407, 415, 605 S.E.2d 540, 544 (2004) (ruling expert could testify that she\r\n  believed the victim in this case because defendant opened the door by\r\n  cross-examining expert about other cases in which she did not believe victim); State\r\n    v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 541, 579 S.E.2d 318, 319 (2003) (holding defense\r\n  counselâ€™s opening statement â€œopenedÂ  the door to the introduction of evidence\r\n  rebutting the contention that [defendant] was merely an addictâ€); State v.\r\n    Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 175, 508 S.E.2d 870, 878 (1998) (â€œ[B]ecause appellant\r\n  â€œopened the doorâ€ about his relationship with his wife, the solicitor was\r\n  entitled to cross-examine him about the relationship, even if the responses\r\n  brought out appellantâ€™s prior criminal domestic violence conviction.â€). Â Â \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  an appellant cannot complain of prejudice resulting from admission of evidence\r\n  to which she opened the door.Â  See State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614,\r\n  623, 582 S.E.2d 426, 431 (2003) (noting one who opens the door to evidence\r\n  cannot complain of its admission); State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 474,\r\n  409 S.E.2d 404, 408 (1991) (â€œSince appellant opened the door to this evidence,\r\n  he cannot complain of prejudice from its admission.â€); State v. Beam,\r\n  336 S.C. 45, 53, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct.App.1999) (â€œBeam cannot complain about\r\n  the admission of evidence where he opened the door to the evidence.â€).\r\nIn the\r\n  present case, during recross, defense counsel asked Feagin why she was able to\r\n  assist in preparing composite sketches, â€œbut now say you canâ€™t identify them\r\n  because you didnâ€™t get a good look at them.Â  How could you say all of those\r\n  things if you didnâ€™t get a good look at them?â€Â  Feagin responded, â€œI didnâ€™t say\r\n  I couldnâ€™t identify them because I couldnâ€™t get a good look at them.Â  Itâ€™s been\r\n  a long time, Iâ€™m sure I can still identify them, itâ€™s just been a long time\r\n  since I had a look at them.â€Â   \r\nIn an in camera hearing, the State asked the court to allow Feaginâ€™s in-court identification\r\n  of Rice on redirect in â€œresponse to new matter brought up by the defense\r\n  attorney during his recross.â€Â  The prosecutor emphasized â€œ[I] never asked her\r\n  if she could identify them.Â  [Defense counsel] asked her about that.Â  And she\r\n  responded that she could.Â  The jury heard it. . . .â€Â Â   \r\nRice countered\r\n  that the State laid the foundation for Feaginâ€™s in-court identification on\r\n  direct examination, but stopped short of extracting it.Â  The trial court\r\n  reviewed direct, cross, redirect and recross testimony and ultimately determined:\r\n\r\n\tThere was no discussion at all that Iâ€™m seeing that touched on the\r\n  issue of whether or not she [Feagin] could make an identification here and\r\n  now.Â  Iâ€™m not seeing that at all in direct or redirect. . . . \r\n\tI thought that was where they [the State] were going, they never\r\n  did. . . . Â Nobody ever brought up, an any point, until your [defense\r\n  counselâ€™s] last question to her, whether or not she could make an\r\n  identification of the person if she saw them.Â  It just never got brought up. .\r\n  . . Â Â Â \r\n\r\nBased\r\n  on the review of the transcript, the trial court concluded defense counsel opened\r\n  the door allowing the State to elicit Feaginâ€™s in-court identification.Â  Rice\r\n  cannot complain about the admission of identification evidence when she opened\r\n  the door to that evidence.Â   \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Business\r\n  Records\r\nRice\r\n  asserts the trial court admitted her former employerâ€™s business records in\r\n  error.Â  Specifically, Rice claims the records constituted inadmissible hearsay\r\n  because they lacked the level of trustworthiness required under Rule 803(6), SCRE. Â We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina adopted section 19-5-510 of the South Carolina Code, the Uniform Business\r\n  Record as Evidence Act, prior to the promulgation of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Evidence.Â  The statute provides:  \r\n\r\n\tA record of an act, condition or event shall, insofar as relevant,\r\n  be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to\r\n  its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular\r\n  course of business, at or near the time of the act, condition or event and if,\r\n  in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of\r\n  preparation were such as to justify its admission.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-5-510 (1985).\r\nThis section\r\n  gives the trial court control to exclude or require additional proof if the\r\n  authenticity or trustworthiness of the business record is suspect.Â  SeeÂ  Kershaw County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. McCaskill, 276\r\n  S.C. 360, 362, 278 S.E.2d 771, 773 (1981).Â   \r\nPatterned\r\n  after the South Carolina Act and the Federal Rules, Rule 803(6), SCRE, excepts\r\n  records of regularly conducted activity from the hearsay exclusion.[3]Â  Excepted records include:\r\n\r\n\tA memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of\r\n  acts, events, conditions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from\r\n  information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a\r\n  regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of\r\n  that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data\r\n  compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified\r\n  witness, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of\r\n  preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness; provided, however, that subjective\r\n  opinions and judgments found in business records are not admissible. The term\r\n  â€œbusinessâ€ as used in this subsection includes business, institution,\r\n  association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not\r\n  conducted for profit.\r\n\r\nRule 803(6), SCRE.\r\nA\r\n  business record without evidence about the manner in which it is prepared or\r\n  the source of its information does not meet the requirements in either section\r\n  19-5-510 or Rule 803(6), SCRE. Â See State v. Sarvis, 317\r\n  S.C. 102, 107, 450 S.E.2d 606, 609 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Connelly\r\n    v. Wometco Enterprises, Inc., 314 S.C. 188, 191, 442 S.E.2d 204, 206 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1994) (holding employment file, although relevant and otherwise\r\n  admissible, was properly excluded from evidence where the employer failed to\r\n  offer the file through its custodian or another qualified witness); State v.\r\n    McFarlane 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1983) (finding trial\r\n  court properly refused to admit medical report when no one could testify to the\r\n  identity, mode of preparation, or whether report was made in the regular course\r\n  of business at or near the time of the accident). Â Â Business record entries\r\n  must have been made at or near the time of the act to which they relate; the\r\n  purpose of this mandate is to aid in establishing that the record was honestly\r\n  and fairly kept.Â  South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank v. Jones, 302 S.C.\r\n  154, 155, 394 S.E.2d 323, 324 (1990).Â   \r\nAmericaâ€™s Best Security (ABS) business records tracked weapons and other equipment issued\r\n  to employees.Â  The records custodian for the company identified the admitted documents.Â \r\n  She confirmed the records were kept in the normal course of the companyâ€™s\r\n  business and prepared according to the requirements of the law.Â  The record indicating\r\n  Riceâ€™s assigned equipment had not been returned was submitted on November 29,\r\n  2001, approximately one month after Brennanâ€™s murder and Riceâ€™s termination\r\n  from ABS.  \r\nThe\r\n  admitted documents contained the following information: Â Rice was issued a\r\n  weapon and qualified by SLED to shoot a .357 Magnum-type gun; her last working\r\n  day was October 30, 2001; SLED was notified of Riceâ€™s termination from ABS;\r\n  Rice was listed among employees terminated in the last ninety days on November\r\n  29, 2001; and Rice had not returned equipment assigned to her, including her\r\n  weapon, as of November 29, 2001.Â  Two ABS employees with supervisory authority over\r\n  Rice corroborated this evidence.Â  Furthermore, the testimony of the records\r\n  custodian and corroborating witnesses underwent vigorous cross-examination.Â \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  essence of Riceâ€™s challenge is that ABS is now bankrupt and some records were stored\r\n  and possibly misplaced, rendering the entire record keeping process\r\n  untrustworthy.Â  However, Rule 803(6), SCRE, focuses on the source of the\r\n  information or the method and circumstances of preparation as indicia of\r\n  trustworthiness.Â  No probative evidence suggests the sources of the information\r\n  recorded in the ABS documents were not credible or the methods and\r\n  circumstances of preparation were unreliable.Â  The evidence Rice relies on simply\r\n  identified problems in accessing the business records after the company stored them\r\n  and does not cast suspicion on the recordsâ€™ trustworthiness.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  any error in admitting the ABS business records was harmless.Â  The records were\r\n  merely cumulative to the testimony of Riceâ€™s supervisors, who confirmed that\r\n  Rice had not returned her weapon as of November 29, 2001.Â  State v. Douglas,\r\n  367 S.C. 498, 520, 626 S.E.2d 59, 71 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œThe admission of\r\n  improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other\r\n  evidence.â€) cert. granted June, 2007.  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Curative\r\n  Instruction \r\nIn closing\r\n  argument, the prosecutor asked the jury to give the victimâ€™s wife peace and the\r\n  victim justice.Â  Rice contends the trial court erred by failing to give the\r\n  jury an instruction curing the prosecutorâ€™s comment.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  State urges that Rice failed to preserve this issue for appellate review by\r\n  raising the issue in an off-the-record conference.Â  An objection made during an\r\n  off-the-record conference which is not made part of the record does not\r\n  preserve the question for review.Â  York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325\r\n  S.C. 170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997).Â  However, in State v. Hamilton,\r\n  we held York was inapplicable when the initial off-the-record bench\r\n  conference was later made a part of the record.Â  344 S.C. 344, 361, 543 S.E.2d\r\n  586, 595 (Ct. App. 2001) overruled on other grounds by State v.\r\n    Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â   \r\nIn Hamilton , defense counsel requested a jury instruction on the prosecutorâ€™s comments\r\n  during an off-the-record bench conference.Â  Id. at 360, 543 S.E.2d at\r\n  595.Â  The trial court denied the request and defense counsel moved for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  Id. at 361, 543 S.E.2d at 595.Â  The State alleged any errors\r\n  raised by Hamilton in the bench conference were off-the-record and not\r\n  preserved.Â  Id. at 360, 543 S.E.2d at 595. Â We held the initial off-the-record\r\n  conference had subsequently been made part of the record by the acquiescence of\r\n  the judge, prosecution, and defense counsel.Â  The issue appellant raised\r\n  concerning the prosecutorâ€™s comment was preserved for review.Â  Id.\r\nAs in Hamilton , defense counsel in the case at bar put his objection to the prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  comment on the record when the jury began its deliberation.Â  Counsel\r\n  specifically stated his requested reliefâ€”a curative instructionâ€”and the basis\r\n  for his objectionâ€”that the comment improperly injected passion or sympathy into\r\n  the trial.Â  Neither the trial court nor the State objected to defense counsel\r\n  putting his exception on the record.Â  Therefore, Riceâ€™s objection to the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s failure to give a curative instruction is preserved.\r\nIt is\r\n  well settled that the prosecutionâ€™s closing argument must not appeal to the personal\r\n  biases of the jurors or be calculated to arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or\r\n  prejudices.Â  Humphries\r\n    v. State, 351 S.C. 362, 373, 570\r\n  S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002); Simmons v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998) (citing State\r\n    v.Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996)).Â  The\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s closing argument should be confined to evidence in the record and\r\n  the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence.Â  Vaughn v.\r\n    State, 362 S.C. 163, 169, 607 S.E.2d 72, 75 (2004).Â   \r\nAn argument\r\n  asking the jurors to place themselves in the victimâ€™s shoes tends to destroy completely\r\n  all sense of impartiality of the jurors, and its effect is to arouse passion\r\n  and prejudice.Â  State v. Reese, 370 S.C. 31, 38, 633 S.E.2d 898, 901 (2006).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe â€˜Golden Ruleâ€™ argument, suggesting to jurors as it does that they\r\n  put themselves in the shoes of one of the parties, is generally impermissible\r\n  because it encourages the jurors to depart from neutrality and to decide the\r\n  case on the basis of personal interest and bias rather than on the evidence. Â Regardless\r\n  of the nomenclature used, any argument that importunes the jurors to places\r\n  themselves in the victimâ€™s shoes is disallowed Golden Rule Argument. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Reese, 359\r\n  S.C. 260, 271, 597 S.E.2d 169, 175 (Ct. App. 2004), revâ€™d on other grounds\r\n    by 370 S.C. at 38, 633 S.E.2d at 901.Â   \r\nProsecutors\r\n  are bound to rules of fairness in their closing arguments. Â State v. Linder,\r\n  276 S.C. 304, 312, 278 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981).Â  â€œWhile the solicitor should\r\n  prosecute vigorously, his duty is not to convict a defendant but to see justice\r\n  done.Â  The solicitorâ€™s closing argument must, of course, be based upon this\r\n  principle.â€Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 222, 641 S.E.2d 873, 880\r\n  (2007).\r\nWhen\r\n  objection is timely made to improper remarks of counsel, the judge should rule\r\n  on the objection, give a curative charge to the jury, and instruct offending\r\n  counsel to desist from improper remarks. Â Mishoe v. QHG of Lake City, Inc.,\r\n  366 S.C. 195, 202, 621 S.E.2d 363, 367 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing McElveen v.\r\n    Ferre, 299 S.C. 377, 381, 385 S.E.2d 39, 41 (Ct. App. 1989)).Â  Failure to give a requested jury instruction is not\r\n  prejudicial error when the instructions given afford the proper test for\r\n  determining the issues.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565\r\n  S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002) (citation omitted).Â  â€œAn error not shown to be\r\n  prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.â€Â  Brown v. Pearson,\r\n  326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997); see also State\r\n    v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195-96, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\n \r\nHere, the prosecutor, while explaining\r\n  demeanor evidence to the jury, made the following comment concerning witness Bryant:\r\n\r\n\tAs an example of demeanor how you can tell when somebodyâ€™s telling\r\n  the truth, you saw her when she was telling you, begging for forgiveness for\r\n  being too much of a coward to do something or to come forward and how she\r\n  begged forgiveness and said she wanted Hilda to have peace.Â  You saw that.Â  You\r\n  know that was raw truth.Â  She want Hildaâ€”she wanted to give Hilda peace.Â \r\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to give Hilda and Bernard justice as\r\n  well.[4] \r\n\r\nDefense\r\n  counsel approached the bench and the trial court held an off-the-record\r\n  conference.Â  Defense counsel proceeded with closing argument.Â  When the jury\r\n  moved into deliberation, defense counsel reiterated the objection to the\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s comment he had previously made off-the record:Â   \r\n\r\n\tI objected to him making statements that the jury owed Hilda\r\n  Brennan justice.Â  I would ask that the jury be given a curative instruction on\r\n  that.Â  I believe that that comment improperly injected passion or sympathy into\r\n  the trial of this case.Â  And it was improper statement or comment during the\r\n  opening on the law by the prosecution in this case.\r\n\r\nThe trial court responded:\r\n\r\n\tI told you I think his actual words\r\n  wereâ€”you asked him to bringâ€”he didnâ€™t say that they owed them justice, but I\r\n  did not think it was an improper comment at the time and certainly nothing\r\n  thatâ€™s not cured by the overall instruction to them.\r\n\r\nA\r\n  priori, we observe the trial court properly clarified that the prosecutor asked\r\n  the jury to give the victimâ€™s wife peace and the victim justice.Â  The court\r\n  emphasized the prosecutor did not say â€œthey owed them justice.â€Â  Arguably, the prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  comment was consistent with his duty, not to convict a defendant, but to see justice done.Â  Viewed from\r\n  that perspective, the prosecutor merely asked the jury to do the duty that was\r\n  already required of them.Â  The prosecutorâ€™s comment did not call for the jurors\r\n  to put themselves in the victimâ€™s place and did not rise to the level of a\r\n  Golden Rule argument. Â \r\nIf the prosecutorâ€™s request had reached that level of\r\n  impropriety, the trial courtâ€™s overall instructions to the jury effectively cured\r\n  any potential prejudice.Â  The judge stressed the State had the burden of\r\n  proving Rice guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  He instructed the jury to\r\n  consider only the competent evidence before them, based on the witnesses, exhibits\r\n  made part of the record, and stipulations between counsel.Â  The judge explained\r\n  that, as jurors, they were sworn to accept and apply the law exactly as he\r\n  stated it to them.Â  It was their duty to decide the effect, the value, weight,\r\n  and truth of the evidence presented during the course of the trial.Â  He charged\r\n  them to assess the credibility of witnesses who testified during trial and to evaluate\r\n  the evidence to determine its truthfulness.Â Â  Â \r\nWe conclude the trial court adequately set forth the proper test for determining the issues.Â  Any error in\r\n  failing to give a specific curative instruction was harmless.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;the\r\n  alleged prior inconsistent statement concerning third-party guilt\r\n  was inadmissible under a State v. Gregory and Holmes v. South Carolina analysis;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2)\r\n\t\t\tthe\r\n  investigating officerâ€™s testimony was NOT hearsay under Rule\r\n  801(c), SCRE, and was admissible as a conclusion based on the\r\n  officerâ€™s investigation;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\tthe\r\n  in-court identification of Rice by Heidi Feagin was admissible\r\n  based on State v. Lewis because there was no pre-trial identification\r\n  procedure;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)\r\n\t\t\tthe\r\n  evidence of the former employerâ€™s business records met the test\r\n  of section 19-5-510 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, Uniform Business \r\n\t\t\tRecords as Evidence Act, and Rule 803(6), SCRE;\r\n  and \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5)\r\n\t\t\tthe\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s statement to give the victimâ€™s wife peace and the victim\r\n  justice did NOT violateÂ  State v. Reese, or the Golden Rule\r\n  argument.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, J. and GOOLSBY, A.J. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Rice sought to introduce testimony that Bryantâ€™s\r\n  cousin, Tiki, committed the crimes.Â  However, Bryantâ€™s initial statements to\r\n  police did not mention Tiki, but instead named Nikki as the person involved. Â Trial\r\n  counsel referred to her as â€œsome other girlâ€ and â€œsome other personâ€ in\r\n  questioning Bryant about her prior statements to police. Â Whether Tiki and\r\n  Nikki were the same person remains unresolved.Â   \r\n[2] Rice was tried and convicted prior to the United\r\n  States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S.\r\n  319, 126 S. Ct. 1727 (2006).Â   \r\n[3] Section 19-5-510 has been construed to preclude\r\n  admission of subjective opinions or judgments within a business record.Â  SeeÂ  McCaskill, 276 S.C. at 362,Â  278 S.E.2d at 773; State v. Key, 277\r\n  S.C. 214, 215, 284 S.E.2d 781, 783 (1981); State v. Patterson, 290 S.C.\r\n  523, 527-28, 351 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1986).Â  The Federal Rules of Evidence do not\r\n  contain this restriction.Â  Consequently, Rule 803(6), SCRE, differs from the\r\n  federal rule in that the word â€œopinionsâ€ in the first sentence is deleted and\r\n  the phrase, â€œprovided, however, that subjective opinions and judgments found in\r\n  business records are not admissibleâ€ is added to the federal rule to make it\r\n  consistent with state law.  \r\n[4] Â Â Hilda is Bernard Brennanâ€™s widow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4301","title":"Blackwell v.

Porter, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  Anita\r\n  Blackwell appeals the family courtâ€™s decision to award Kasper Fulgum, Jr. $9,411.00\r\n  in past due child support and $3,368.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.[1]Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nAnita Blackwell\r\n  (Mother) and Kasper Fulgum, Jr. (Father) were formerly husband and wife, and\r\n  during their marriage, they had two children.Â  The two children (Daughter and\r\n  Son) were born on April 8, 1985 and November 14, 1986, respectively.Â  In a\r\n  February 28, 2001 order (the Original Support Order), the family court awarded,\r\n  by agreement of the parties, custody to Father and ordered Mother to pay Father\r\n  $760.00 per month for child support.Â   \r\nMother paid the\r\n  required child support until June 15, 2003, whereupon she then reduced her\r\n  child support payment to $386.00 per month.Â  Mother believed she was justified\r\n  in reducing her child support by one-half because Daughter had reached eighteen\r\n  years of age and graduated from high school at the end of May.[2]Â \r\n  Father immediately responded by sending a letter to Mother indicating that she\r\n  was in default of the child support order, and informing her that she needed to\r\n  submit current financial information to either his attorney, her attorney, or\r\n  the Greenville County Family Court to seek a reduction in child support.Â  After\r\n  receiving no response from Mother, Father had his attorney send Mother a second\r\n  letter.Â  This letter again informed Mother that it was not proper for her to\r\n  reduce the child support without a court order and offered to work with Mother\r\n  on establishing a proper reduction in child support.Â  Motherâ€™s current husband\r\n  responded with a letter informing Father any order amending the Original\r\n  Support Order must reflect a $386.00 per month child support obligation on the\r\n  part of Mother or else Father would have to send his financial information to\r\n  Mother.Â Â   \r\nMother continued paying $386.00 (or the corrected\r\n  $380.00) per month to Father until March 15, 2005.Â  However, beginning in\r\n  September 2004 and continuing through January 2005, Mother ceased making\r\n  support payments to Father and paid directly to Son because she believed Son\r\n  was no longer living with Father.Â  Mother ceased payments to Father again in\r\n  April 2005 because she again believed Son was living elsewhere.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  January 2005, Father filed a rule to show cause motion, and the family court,\r\n  on January 24, 2005, issued an order for Mother to appear on February 11, 2005\r\n  to show cause why she should not be held in contempt.Â  This order specifically\r\n  and separate from the issue of contempt additionally ordered Mother to show\r\n  cause why she should not pay a reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â \r\n  Mother failed to appear at the rule to show cause hearing, and Father was\r\n  awarded $14,668.00 in child support and $865.00 for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â \r\n  Mother was held in contempt and sentenced to one year incarceration which could\r\n  be purged upon payment of the child support and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On April 18,\r\n  2005, the family court vacated this contempt order in response to Motherâ€™s\r\n  motions to alter and amend and for relief from the judgment.Â  The family court\r\n  found Motherâ€™s notice of the proceedings was defective and ordered a new trial de novo on the rule to show cause action.Â  \r\n \r\nAs a\r\n  result of the second proceeding concerning Fatherâ€™s rule to show cause motion,\r\n  the family court did not find Mother in contempt, but did order her to pay\r\n  $9,411.00 in child support and $3,368.60 for Fatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The\r\n  family court found that Mother was not entitled to unilaterally reduce her\r\n  child support payments by one-half and was responsible for the full amount of\r\n  support until March 11, 2005, which was the date she filed her motion for\r\n  temporary relief seeking a reduction in her support obligation due to a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\n  has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Abercrombie v. Abercrombie, 372\r\n  S.C. 643, 646, 643 S.E.2d 697, 698 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Despite this broad scope\r\n  of review, we remain mindful that the family court saw and heard the witnesses\r\n  and generally is in a better position to determine credibility.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Child Support\r\n  Arrearage\r\nIt appears Mother\r\n  contends because the family court failed to find her in contempt, it was error to\r\n  enforce the Original Support Order against her.Â  Because Mother failed to\r\n  separate her arguments into individual issues on appeal, it is somewhat unclear\r\n  exactly which arguments she has put forth.Â  However, we will endeavor to\r\n  address each issue raised.Â   \r\nWe first note section\r\n  20-7-420 (17) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides the family court\r\n  with jurisdiction to continue orders for support until the eighteenth birthday\r\n  of the supported child.Â  At which point, under South Carolina law, a parentâ€™s\r\n  obligation to pay child support generally ends by operation of law.Â  Purdy v. Purdy,\r\n  353 S.C. 400, 403, 578 S.E.2d 30, 31 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, the above\r\n  statute further provides a means for the family court to extend support beyond\r\n  the childâ€™s eighteenth birthday if the child is still in high school â€œand is\r\n  making satisfactory progress toward completion of high school, not to exceed\r\n  the nineteenth birthday unless exceptional circumstances are found to exist or\r\n  unless there is a preexisting agreement or order to provide for child support\r\n  past the age of eighteen years . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-420 (17) (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  The statute continues on to provide the court with authority to extend\r\n  support beyond the childâ€™s eighteenth birthday if there are physical or mental\r\n  disabilities of the child or upon a showing of other exceptional circumstances.\r\nIn light of the\r\n  above statute, it would appear at first blush that the now appealed from family\r\n  court order erred in requiring Mother to pay the full amount of support as\r\n  noted in the Original Support Order until Daughter was almost twenty years of\r\n  age.[3]Â \r\n  However, where one of multiple children reaches majority, a parentâ€™s child\r\n  support obligation will not be affected absent a family court order modifying\r\n  the amount of support owed.Â  Bull v. Smith, 299 S.C. 123, 126, 382\r\n  S.E.2d 905, 907 (1989).Â  See also Stroman v. Williams, 291\r\n  S.C. 376, 380, 353 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding that â€œ[w]here a\r\n  support order â€˜provides for payments for the benefit of two or more children,\r\n  the marriage or emancipation of one minor child does not automatically affect\r\n  the liability of the father for the full sum prescribed in the order.â€™â€).Â \r\n  Where one of multiple children becomes emancipated, the family court does not\r\n  extend the parentâ€™s support obligation on behalf of the emancipated child. Â The\r\n  court simply continues the existing support agreement for the benefit of the\r\n  other minor child[ren] until such time as the court, upon request of the\r\n  supporting parent, can calculate a proper reduction in the support obligation\r\n  based on a showing of changed circumstances.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen a party is\r\n  found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose\r\n  sanctions remains a matter for the\r\n  courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 263, 621 S.E.2d\r\n  389, 392-93 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Perhaps in its discretion, the family court found\r\n  that mother had a good faith belief that she was entitled to a reduction based\r\n  upon the emancipation of Daughter, and therefore, decided against finding her\r\n  in contempt.Â  Regardless of the contempt, Mother owed Father support under the\r\n  unmodified terms of the Original Support Order.Â  We find no error by the family\r\n  court in failing to find Mother in contempt and ordering her to pay the child\r\n  support arrearage.Â   \r\nMother next appears\r\n  to raise an estoppel argument.Â  Mother claims Father should not be permitted to\r\n  collect the child support arrearage because she was prejudiced by Fatherâ€™s\r\n  eighteen month delay in filing his rule to show cause action.Â  Mother claims\r\n  she was prevented from seeking a modification because it was not until Father\r\n  filed his motion to show cause that she was put on notice that he was refusing\r\n  to accept her one-half child support payments.Â  We find this argument unpersuasive\r\n  and untenable.Â  We first note that Mother was free to petition the court for a\r\n  change in her support obligation at any time, but she instead opted to\r\n  unilaterally reduce her support payments in violation of the family court\r\n  order.Â  Further, in both a letter from Father and a letter from Fatherâ€™s\r\n  attorney, Mother was informed that her actions were in violation of the family\r\n  court order and the means by which she could remedy this problem.Â  In light of\r\n  these facts, we find any argument made by Mother based on estoppel or unconscionability to be without merit.\r\n \r\nMother next argues\r\n  the family court erred in its award of child support arrearage because it\r\n  failed to credit her for the support she paid directly to Son.Â  The Original\r\n  Support Order stated: â€œThe Mother shall make semi-monthly child support\r\n  payments to the Father in the amount of $380.00.â€Â  The general rule is that it\r\n  is the obligation of the divorced spouse to pay the specified amounts according\r\n  to the terms of the decree and said spouse should not be permitted to vary\r\n  these terms as a matter of convenience.Â  Foster v. Foster, 294 S.C. 373,\r\n  375, 364 S.E.2d 753, 754 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The family court correctly noted\r\n  â€œ[t]he Mother was required to send the support to the custodian parent regardless\r\n  of where the child was residing unless an order was entered, either by consent\r\n  or otherwise.â€Â  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s failure to credit Mother\r\n  for payments made directly to Son.\r\nLastly,\r\n  Mother contends equity and fairness dictates we hold the child support\r\n  arrearage in abeyance pursuant to section 20-7-933 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  She goes on to suggest the legislative intent of this abeyance\r\n  provision is for conditions such as those encountered in this case.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  Mother requests that this court hold her support arrearage in abeyance\r\n  permanently; however, the very definition of â€œabeyanceâ€ is that of â€œtemporary\r\n  inactivityâ€ or â€œsuspension.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 4 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Further,\r\n  we are not persuaded by Motherâ€™s assertion that the legislatureâ€™s intent in\r\n  enacting the abeyance provision of the statute was to protect parents who\r\n  unilaterally reduce their support payments in violation of a family court\r\n  order.Â  We deduce no support for holding the arrearage in abeyance.\r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nMother contends the\r\n  family court erred in awarding Father attorneyâ€™s fees and in failing to award\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to her.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nâ€œSuit money,\r\n  including attorneyâ€™s fees, may be\r\n  assessed for or against a party to an action brought in or subject to the\r\n  jurisdiction of the family court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(38) (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  An attorneyâ€™s fees award is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C.\r\n  64, 88, 641 S.E.2d 446, 458 (Ct. App. 2006).Â   \r\nGenerally,\r\n  we would be inclined to determine an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in accordance\r\n  with the factors outlined in the case of E.D.M. v. T.A.M..[4]Â \r\n  However, if the case before us presents an added dimension of an uncooperative\r\n  spouse who hampers a final resolution of the issues in dispute, we will not\r\n  reward an adversary spouse for such conduct.Â  Anderson v. Tolbert,\r\n  322 S.C. 543, 549, 473 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Of particular concern\r\n  are those occasions which force one parent to seek sanctions against the other\r\n  parent for violating court orders.Â  Id. at 550, 473 S.E.2d at 459.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, it was Motherâ€™s conduct in unilaterally reducing her child support\r\n  obligation which violated the court order and precipitated Fatherâ€™s rule to\r\n  show cause motion.Â  Motherâ€™s refusal to cooperate with Fatherâ€™s offer to\r\n  negotiate a proper reduction in child support necessitated the filing of his\r\n  motion and ultimately, Motherâ€™s need to hire an attorney.Â  Further, the initial\r\n  ruling on the rule to show cause motion was vacated because the family court found Motherâ€™s notice of\r\n  the proceedings was defective, not because of any misstatements by Father.Â  Therefore,\r\n  contrary to Motherâ€™s assertions that Fatherâ€™s misstatements prolonged the case,\r\n  even had Father not misspoken during the initial hearing, a second hearing\r\n  would have been required.Â  Because the family court vacated the initial order\r\n  and ordered a new trial de novo, the misstatements by Father had\r\n  no bearing upon the second hearing.Â  The court would have been required to\r\n  address any discrepancies between Father and Motherâ€™s accounts of the support\r\n  arrearage to determine the amount owed regardless of any misstatements made by\r\n  Father in the first hearing.Â   \r\nLastly, we note that since the initial order regarding the rule to\r\n  show cause was vacated, Mother did not, as she contends, receive a reduction in\r\n  child support arrears from $14,668.00 to $9,411.00.Â  This second hearing, which\r\n  was a new trial de novo, resulted in her having to pay $9,411.00\r\n  in child support arrearage.Â  We fail to discern a manner in which she could\r\n  entitle this a beneficial result.Â  We find no error with the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that â€œMother required the bringing of this action and her actions\r\n  weighed heavily in the attorneyâ€™s fees award.â€Â   \r\nIII.Â  Time\r\n  Allotted to Pay Support Arrearage and Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nMother contends the\r\n  family court erred in requiring her to pay the child support arrearage on or\r\n  before March 1, 2006 and the attorneyâ€™s fees on or before January 15, 2006.Â \r\n  She contends this amount of time was improper and constituted an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œQuestions\r\n  concerning child support are ordinarily committed to the discretion\r\n  of the family court, whose\r\n  conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  South Carolina Dept. of Social Services, County of Siskiyou v. Martin, 371 S.C. 21, 24, 637 S.E.2d 310, 312 (2006).Â  With the\r\n  record before us, we cannot find an abuse of discretion on the part of the\r\n  family court.Â  The family court was in a position superior to this court from\r\n  which to evaluate the appropriate time frame allotted for payment and was free\r\n  to impute income to Mother who was voluntarily unemployed.Â  See Patel\r\n    v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 532, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (â€œIt is proper to\r\n  impute income to a party who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court\r\n  did not err in its award of child support arrearage and attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  that the time allotted for payment was not an abuse of discretion.Â  Based on the foregoing, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] It appears Mother was mistakenly paying $772.00 per\r\n  month in support and not the required $760.00 per month.Â  Therefore, $386.00\r\n  per month represents a one-half reduction in support.Â  This is likely due to\r\n  the fact that the Original Support Order dictated that Mother pay $772.00 per\r\n  month from August of 2001 through November of 2001 and then pay $760.00 per\r\n  month thereafter.Â  The parties agree Mother overpaid father in the amount of\r\n  $180.00.Â   \r\n[3] The appealed from order requires Mother to pay the\r\n  full $760.00 per month in child support until March 11, 2005 and then one-half\r\n  of that through Sonâ€™s June 2005 graduation.Â  On March 11, 2005, Daughter would\r\n  have attained the age of nineteen years and eleven months.Â Â   \r\n[4] In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider each partyâ€™s\r\n  ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the\r\n  partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™\r\n  standards of living.

State, 338 S.C. 139, 144-45, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).Â Â  A PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision will be reversed if it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  If the case raises a novel question of law, this Court is free to decide the\r\n  question without deference to the lower court.Â  State v. McClinton, 369\r\n  S.C. 167, 169, 631 S.E.2d 895, 896 (2006).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  issue of whether a PCR court has authority to sanction a PCR applicant under\r\n  Rule 11 is one of first impression.Â  Thus, we are free to make our\r\n  determination without deference to the PCR court.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act[4] (the Act) contemplates the applicability of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure in PCR actions.Â  Section 17-27-80 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2006) states, â€œAll rules and statutes applicable in civil\r\n  proceedings are available to the parties.â€ (emphasis added).Â   \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to determine and\r\n  give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist.\r\n    v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993).Â \r\n  The best evidence of legislative intent is the text of the statute.Â  Wade\r\n    v. State, 348 S.C. 255, 259, 559 S.E.2d\r\n  843, 844 (2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  If\r\n  the\r\n  terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to\r\n  their literal meaning.Â  City of Columbia v. Am. Civil\r\n    Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 2d 747, 749\r\n  (1996).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  plain language of section 17-27-10 requires all rules that apply in a civil\r\n  case apply to PCR actions.Â  A PCR action is a civil action.Â  Council v.\r\n    Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 125, 597 S.E.2d 782, 784 (2004).Â Â  Consequently, Rule\r\n  11 would apply to PCR proceedings because PCR actions are civil.Â   \r\nMoreover,\r\n  section 17-27-150(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) states, â€œA party\r\n  in a noncapital [PCR] proceeding shall be entitled to invoke the processes of\r\n  discovery available under the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure if, and\r\n  to the extent that, the judge . . . grants leave to do so . . . .â€Â  Section\r\n  17-27-150(B) states, â€œA party in a capital [PCR] proceeding shall be entitled\r\n  to invoke the processes of discovery available under the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure.â€Â   \r\nSection\r\n  17-27-150 indicates the legislatureâ€™s express intent to afford PCR applicants\r\n  limited use of the discovery process as stated in the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure.Â  If the legislature sought to limit the applicability of Rule\r\n  11 to PCR proceedings as it sought to limit the discovery process, the legislature\r\n  would have inserted constricting language to that effect in the Act.Â \r\n  Additionally, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure support the\r\n  conclusion that Rule 11 is applicable to PCR actions.Â   \r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure â€œgovern the procedure in all South Carolina courts in all suits of a civil nature . . . .â€ Rule 1, SCRCP\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Furthermore, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  apply to PCR actions â€œto the extent that they are not inconsistent with the\r\n  Act.â€Â  Rule 71.1(a), SCRCP.  \r\nWhen\r\n  interpreting language of a court rule, the same rules of construction employed\r\n  in interpreting statutes apply.Â  State v. Brown, 344 S.C. 302, 307, 543 S.E.2d\r\n  568, 571 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œTherefore, the words of [the\r\n  rule] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle\r\n  or forced construction to limit or expand the rule.â€Â  Id. (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).Â  Given the plain language of\r\n  Rules 1 and 71.1 and that Rule 11 is consistent with the Act, ample\r\n  justification exists to conclude Rule 11 applies to PCR actions.[5]Â  See Leamon\r\n    v. State, 363 S.C. 432, 434, 611 S.E.2d 494, 495 (2005) (holding\r\n  PCR actions are governed by the usual rules of civil procedure); Sutton v.\r\n    State, 361 S.C. 644, 647, 606 S.E.2d 779, 780 (2004) (â€œA PCR action is a\r\n  civil action generally subject to rules and statutes that apply in civil\r\n  proceedings.â€) overruled on other grounds by Â Bray v.

Bartlett (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding her former husband,\r\n  James P. Rachels (Husband), was not in contempt of court for allegedly violating\r\n  a provision of the partiesâ€™ 1996 divorce decree and denying her request for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married on June 28, 1986, and were\r\n  divorced on January 30, 1996.Â  In 2006, Wife sought to hold Husband in contempt\r\n  for his â€œdeliberate and willful failure to pay a percentage of his military\r\n  pension to [Wife],â€ as ordered in the divorce decree.Â   \r\n\r\n\tThe provisions of the decree at issue provide: \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\ta.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t[Wife] . . . shall be \r\n\t\t\t\tentitled to receive military retired pay upon the retirement \r\n\t\t\t\tfrom the United States Navy of [Husband] . . . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tb. \r\n\t\t\t\t[Wife] is entitled to \r\n\t\t\t\tTwenty-two and one-half percent (22Â½%) of the military retired \r\n\t\t\t\tpay of an E-7 rank as a distribution of marital property and \r\n\t\t\t\tdirects the Defense Finance and Accounting Center [DFAC] . . . to pay Twenty-two and one-half percent (22Â½%) of\r\n  an E-7 retired pay directly to [Wife] upon [Husbandâ€™s] retirement from the\r\n  Navy.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tc.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tThis Order may be served on \r\n\t\t\t\tthe Secretary of the Defense, Secretary of the Navy, or designee \r\n\t\t\t\tas authorized under 10 U.S.C. Section 1408[.]\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, Wife testified regarding her understanding of the\r\n  retirement provision: â€œMy lawyer at the time told me that all I would have to\r\n  do is write into [DFAC].â€Â  However, she also acknowledged that Husband had\r\n  written a letter to her lawyer a few months after the divorce, stating he would\r\n  receive a pension only if he completed twenty years of active duty, and\r\n  notifying her DFAC â€œwill not garnish my pension [as stated in the decree] due\r\n  to the amount of time of our marriage.Â  However, I can request an allotment be\r\n  sent directly to [Wife] at the time of my retirement.â€Â   \r\nFollowing the partiesâ€™ divorce, Husband remained on active duty until\r\n  retiring in 2005 with twenty years of service. Â On October 2, 2005, one month\r\n  before his retirement, Husband again sent Wife a letter concerning the\r\n  retirement provision: â€œOur divorce decree has a section dealing with my\r\n  retirement pension that is very ambiguous.Â  I think it is important that we\r\n  clear up this ambiguity before I retire. . . .Â  Please call me ASAP so we can\r\n  discuss this issue.â€Â  Husband stated that Wifeâ€™s counsel responded: â€œNeither\r\n  Mrs. Bartlett nor I see any reason to compromise.â€Â   \r\nWife nonetheless applied to DFAC for garnishment.Â  But on December\r\n  15, 2005, DFAC denied Wifeâ€™s application, stating: â€œUnder the USFSPA [Uniformed\r\n  Services Former Spousesâ€™ Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. Â§ 1408] we can honor a\r\n  request for payments from retired/retainer pay as property only in those cases\r\n  where the parties were married for at least 10 years during which the member\r\n  performed at least 10 years of creditable military service.â€Â   \r\nIn regard to Husbandâ€™s failure to pay Wife her portion of the\r\n  pension, the family court held that the divorce decree â€œappears ambiguous and\r\n  imprecise and this court cannot hold [Husband] in deliberate willful contempt\r\n  for that reason.â€Â Â  Wife now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from the\r\n  family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364\r\n  S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  However, this broad scope of review\r\n  does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings or to ignore the\r\n  fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Contempt\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  adult who willfully violates, neglects, or refuses to obey or perform a lawful\r\n  order of the court . . . may be proceeded against for contempt of court.â€ S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2006).Â  For\r\n  purposes of contempt, an act is willful if â€œdone voluntarily and intentionally\r\n  with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific\r\n  intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say,\r\n  with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  Spartanburg County Dept. of Social Services v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83,\r\n  370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988).Â   \r\nâ€œBefore\r\n  a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically\r\n  reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Â Henderson v. Henderson, 298\r\n  S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989).Â  â€œThe moving party must show the\r\n  existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance\r\n  with the order.â€Â  Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 42, 545 S.E.2d 830, 832\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if no evidence\r\n  supports it or the trial court has abused its discretion.Â  Brandt v. Gooding,\r\n  368 S.C. 618, 627, 630 S.E.2d 259, 263 (2006). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either\r\n  when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based\r\n  upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€Â  Browning v. Browning,\r\n  366 S.C. 255, 263, 621 S.E.2d 389, 393 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nWife\r\n  contends the family court abused its discretion because the record lacks evidence\r\n  supporting the courtâ€™s conclusion.Â  However, there is no language in the agreement requiring Husband to specifically request a voluntary allotment\r\n  on behalf of Wife.Â  The agreement clearly instructed DFAC, not Husband, to\r\n  submit a portion of Husbandâ€™s pension\r\n  to Wife.Â  In addition, Husband made\r\n  attempts to contact Wife, to address DFACâ€™s refusal to garnish his pension on\r\n  behalf of Wife, and to resolve ambiguities in the order.Â  Because Husbandâ€™s failure to request a voluntary\r\n  allotment or submit a portion of his pension to Wife was not in direct\r\n  contravention to any specific requirement in the order, the family court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in failing to\r\n  hold Husband in contempt.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\n  and Costs\r\nWife also argues\r\n  the family court erred by failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  However,\r\n  â€œ[a]n award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned\r\n  absent abuse by the trial court.â€Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353,\r\n  365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  In awarding attorneyâ€™s fees the family court\r\n  should consider the following factors: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or\r\n  her own attorneyâ€™s fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney;\r\n  (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living. Â E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471,\r\n  476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â   \r\nConsidering the\r\n  aforementioned factors, the family court did not abuse its discretion by\r\n  refusing to award attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  First, Wifeâ€™s attorney did not\r\n  obtain a beneficial result.Â  Second, Wife fails to present any compelling\r\n  evidence in regard to the other factors indicating that she should have been\r\n  awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order\r\n  of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, J. and\r\n  THOMAS, J. concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4304","title":"State v.

Â He\r\n    pulled into a drive off highway â€“ just drive off highway just across I-26. Â Curtis\r\n    pulled up to the side of the house and we got out and got a big red toolbox off\r\n    the back porch and we put it in Curtisâ€™ truck and left. Â Curtis took me back\r\n    home.Â  Curtis left the toolbox at my house on Sandy Clay Road. Â Curtis came\r\n    back and later got the toolbox.Â  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Arrowood read\r\n  and signed the following statement:\r\n\r\n  I have\r\n    read this statement consisting of one page and I swear or affirm the statement\r\n    that I [have] just given is the truth and nothing but the truth, so help me\r\n    God.Â  I also swear this statement was given freely and voluntarily, and I have\r\n    received a copy of this statement. \r\n\r\nA grand jury\r\n  indicted Arrowood for burglary in the\r\n  first degree and larceny.Â  \r\nDespite attesting\r\n  that his first statement â€œwas given freely and voluntarily,â€ Arrowood contends\r\n  his statements were induced by promises of leniency made by Officer Tucker.Â  The\r\n  trial judge conducted a hearing pursuant to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), to determine the voluntariness of Arrowoodâ€™s statements.Â  Arrowood\r\n  testified that in Rutherford County, Tucker â€œsaid I got you for the Corvette\r\n  but if youâ€™ll give me the Corvette up, I will get these charges up here dropped\r\n  and have you brought back to South Carolina.â€Â  Arrowood alleged that in Spartanburg County, â€œ[Officer Tucker] told\r\n  [Arrowood] if [Arrowood] would help him, he would help [Arrowood]â€ by getting\r\n  â€œall of [Arrowoodâ€™s] charges [to] run concurrentâ€ and having â€œthe charges in North Carolina [dropped].â€Â  Arrowood claimed Oglesby told him the officers would â€œput all\r\n  of [Arrowoodâ€™s] bonds together and put it in one capâ€ if Arrowood â€œhelpedâ€ in\r\n  the investigation.Â  Purportedly, Oglesby related this same information to\r\n  Arrowoodâ€™s sister a day or two later. \r\nContrary\r\n  to Arrowoodâ€™s contentions, Tucker and Oglesby professed neither officer\r\n  promised Arrowood anything for his statements. Â Indeed, in the Denno hearing Tucker indicated:\r\n\r\n  Q: Now, during this time at jail, did yâ€™all make promises\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â to [Arrowood]?\r\n  A:\r\n    Â No, sir.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Â Did you threaten [Arrowood] in any way?\r\n  A: Â No, sir. \r\n\r\nOn direct examination Oglesby\r\n  averred: \r\n\r\n  Q:\r\n    Â Were any promises made to [Arrowood]?\r\n  A:\r\n    Â No, sir.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Either about Spartanburg charges or Cherokee charges?\r\n  A:\r\n    No, sir. Â I can assure you not from Cherokee County.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Okay.Â  Did you hear Detective Tucker make any promises?\r\n  A:\r\n    Â No, Sir.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Tucker declared\r\n  neither he nor Oglesby coerced Arrowood into giving a statement.Â  Oglesbyâ€™s testimony corroborated Tuckerâ€™s:\r\n\r\n  Q:\r\n    Did either one of you coerce [Arrowood] in any way?\r\n  A:\r\n    No, Sir.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Did [Arrowood] ultimately give a written statement?\r\n  A:\r\n    Yes, sir, [Arrowood] did. \r\n\r\nTucker explained he\r\n  may have made the following statement to Arrowood during a portion of the\r\n  interrogation and prior to the challenged statements: Â \r\n\r\n  If I\r\n    told him I could help him that would mean that I told him it would be in the\r\n    courtroom if he cooperated. Â That would be the only thing, that if I ever told\r\n    him anything that that would be what I would tell him that I would say Timothy\r\n    Wayne Arrowood cooperated with police in his cases.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Oglesby maintained he\r\n  did not discuss bonds with Arrowood: \r\n\r\n  Q:\r\n    Do you remember any discussion with Mr. Arrowood about a bond?\r\n  A:\r\n    I donâ€™t discuss bonds.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Never?\r\n  A:\r\n    Thatâ€™s up to the magistrateâ€™s office and the solicitorâ€™s office.\r\n\r\nUnder\r\n  cross-examination before the jury, both Tucker and Oglesby avowed they did not\r\n  promise Arrowood leniency.Â  The officers acknowledged they only offered to\r\n  speak on Arrowoodâ€™s behalf to confirm that Arrowood cooperated with their\r\n  investigation.Â  \r\nArrowood moved to have his statements to police suppressed,\r\n  alleging they were induced by promises of leniency. Â The trial judge denied\r\n  Arrowoodâ€™s motion, leaving the determination of the statementsâ€™ voluntariness\r\n  to the jury. Â Specifically, the trial judge ruled: \r\n\r\n  Based on\r\n    everything that I heard, the totality of the manner in which the statements\r\n    were made and they were given, Iâ€™m going to find that the statements were\r\n    freely and voluntarily made. Â Iâ€™m going to allow the statements to be admitted.\r\n    Now, whether or not, you know, the jury can still consider the statements and\r\n    find that they do not - - and give them very little weight, but I will allow it\r\n    to be admitted.Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial judge\r\n  sentenced Arrowood to life imprisonment for burglary and five years of\r\n  imprisonment for larceny.[2] Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge determines the admissibility of a statement upon proof of its\r\n  voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. Â State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 55, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988); State v. Smith,\r\n  268 S.C. 349, 354, 234 S.E.2d 19, 21 (1977).Â  If admitted, the jury determines\r\n  whether the statement was freely and voluntarily given beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  Washington, 296 S.C. at 55-56, 370 S.E.2d at 612.Â  \r\nFactual\r\n  conclusions as to the voluntariness of a statement will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 242, 471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996); Reed\r\n      v. Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 685, 511\r\n  S.E.2d 396, 401 (Ct. App. 1999). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  Id.; State v.\r\n    Douglas,367 S.C. 498, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. granted June 7, 2007; State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472, 613 S.E.2d\r\n  381, 384 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Accordingly, the appellate courts are â€œbound by fact\r\n  findings in response to motions preliminary to trial when the findings are\r\n  supported by the evidence and not clearly wrong or controlled by error of\r\n  law.â€Â  Reed, 333 S.C. at 685, 511 S.E.2d at 401 (citing State v.\r\n    Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 320, 428 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1993)).Â  When reviewing a\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s ruling concerning voluntariness, the appellate court does not re-evaluate\r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but\r\n  simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551 S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nArrowood\r\n  argues the trial judge erred in refusing to\r\n  suppress his statements to police because the statements were induced by promises\r\n  of leniency, rendering them involuntary and inadmissible. Â We disagree.\r\n The\r\n  process for determining whether a statement is voluntary, and thus admissible,\r\n  is bifurcated; it involves determinations by both the judge and the jury.Â \r\n  First, the trial judge must conduct an evidentiary hearing, outside the\r\n  presence of the jury, where the State must show the statement was made\r\n  voluntarily by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376 (1964).Â  If the statement is found to have been given\r\n  voluntarily, it is then submitted to the jury, where its voluntariness must be\r\n  established beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Washington, 296 S.C.\r\n  54, 56, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988).\r\nA\r\n  statement obtained as a result of custodial interrogation is inadmissible\r\n  unless the suspect was advised of and voluntarily waived his or her rights\r\n  under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 498-99 (1966). Â See also State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551 S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001).Â  If a\r\n  suspect is advised of his Miranda rights, but chooses to make a\r\n  statement, the burden is on the State to prove by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that his rights were voluntarily waived. Â Saltz, 346 S.C. at\r\n  136, 551 S.E.2d at 252; State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990); Washington, 296 S.C. at 54, 370 S.E.2d at 611.Â  \r\nWhere\r\n  â€œthe evidence conflicts as to whether a defendantâ€™s statement is voluntary, it\r\n  is, in the first instance, the province of the trial court to determine this\r\n  factual issue by the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  State v. Howard,\r\n  296 S.C. 481, 492-93, 374 S.E.2d 284, 290 (1988); Washington, 296 S.C. at 54, 370\r\n  S.E.2d at 611; State v. Adams, 279 S.C. 228, 235, 306 S.E.2d 208, 212 (1983).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s determination of the voluntariness\r\n  of the statement must be made on the totality of the circumstances, including\r\n  the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.Â  Saltz, 346 S.C. at 136, 551 S.E.2d at\r\n  252; Rochester, 301 S.C. at 200, 391 S.E.2d at 247; Howard, 296\r\n  S.C. at 488, 374 S.E.2d at 288; State v. Linnen, 278 S.C. 175, 179, 293\r\n  S.E.2d 851, 853-54 (1982); State\r\n    v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, 462, 272 S.E.2d\r\n  634, 636 (1980). Â â€œIn order to secure the admission of a\r\n  defendantâ€™s statement, the State must affirmatively show the statement was\r\n  voluntary and taken in compliance with Miranda.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Middleton,\r\n  288 S.C. 21, 25, 339 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1986).\r\nOnce the trial\r\n  judge determines the statement is admissible, it is up to the jury to\r\n  ultimately find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statement was voluntarily\r\n  made.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243, 471 S.E.2d 689, 695\r\n  (1996); State v. Callahan, 263 S.C. 35, 41, 208 S.E.2d 284, 286 (1974).Â  \r\nA\r\n  statement â€œmay not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, [or]\r\n  obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, [or] by the\r\n  exertion of improper influence.â€Â  Rochester, 301 S.C. at 200, 391 S.E.2d at 247 (citing Hutto v. Ross, 429 U.S. 28, 30 (1976) (brackets in original)).Â  Moreover, â€œa statement induced\r\n  by a promise of leniency is involuntary only if so connected with the\r\n  inducement as to be a consequence of the promise.â€Â  Saltz, 346 S.C. at\r\n  136, 551 S.E.2d at 252.Â  See also State v. Peake, 291 S.C.\r\n  138, 139, 352 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1987); State v. Broome, 268 S.C. 99, 232\r\n  S.E.2d 324 (1977). Â The pertinent inquiry is, as always, whether the defendantâ€™s\r\n  will was â€œoverborne.â€Â  Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 244, 471 S.E.2d at 695.\r\nIn State v. Peake, the defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to\r\n  life imprisonment.Â  291 S.C. at 138, 352 S.E.2d at 488.Â  Peake appealed,\r\n  arguing the trial judge erred in admitting a statement Peake made while in\r\n  police custody.Â  The Court found an investigating officer induced Peakeâ€™s\r\n  statement by promising the State would not seek the death penalty.Â  Id.Â  At the suppression hearing, the investigating officer admitted that he did, in\r\n  fact, guarantee the State would not seek the death penalty if Peake surrendered\r\n  his statement.Â  Id.Â  The Court ruled the promise of leniency, tendered\r\n  by an officer in a position of apparent authority, rendered Peakeâ€™s statement\r\n  involuntary and inadmissible.Â  Id.Â  \r\nContrastively,\r\n  in Rochester, the defendant argued his confession was improperly induced\r\n  by a polygraph examinerâ€™s comment that it would be in Rochesterâ€™s best interest\r\n  to tell the truth. Â 301 S.C. at 199, 391 S.E.2d at 246.Â  The Court found the\r\n  examinerâ€™s statement â€œ[s]tanding alone . . . did not constitute the kind of\r\n  hope of reward or benefit condemned by this Court in Peake.â€ 301 S.C. at\r\n  200-01, 391 S.E.2d at 247.â€).Â  Â Â \r\nArrowood asserts his statements\r\n  were not freely and voluntarily given because they were induced by the officersâ€™\r\n  promises to â€œhelpâ€ as long as he cooperated with the investigation. Â Arrowood\r\n  claims the â€œhelpâ€ promised was to have the North Carolina charges dropped,\r\n  secure a low bond, and have other charges run concurrently.Â  Tucker and Oglesby\r\n  categorically denied making those promises.Â  Instead, the officers insist the\r\n  only â€œhelpâ€ they offered Arrowood\r\n  was to testify in court that he cooperated with the investigation.Â  Under precedent emanating from South Carolina\r\n  jurisprudence, the officersâ€™ offer to attest to Arrowoodâ€™s cooperation did not\r\n  constitute promises of leniency. Â See Saltz, 346 S.C. at 136, 551\r\n  S.E.2d at 252; Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 244, 471 S.E.2d at 695; Rochester, 301 S.C. at 200-01, 391 S.E.2d at\r\n  247; Howard, 296 S.C. at 492-93, 374 S.E.2d at 290; Peake, 291\r\n  S.C. at 139, 352 S.E.2d at 488; Broome, 268 S.C. at 99, 232 S.E.2d at 325.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Arrowood produced his statements in the mere â€œhopeâ€ of leniency based on his\r\n  cooperation, rather than as the consequence of promises.Â  \r\nUnlike\r\n  the uncontroverted evidence in Peake, at the Denno hearing Arrowoodâ€™s\r\n  testimony challenged the officersâ€™ denial that they promised him leniency.Â  The\r\n  Court encountered similarly conflicting testimony in State v. Howard.Â \r\n  296 S.C. at 492, 374 S.E.2d at 289. Â Howard asserted his statement was involuntary\r\n  because it was induced by a promise to consolidate all his offenses into one\r\n  life sentence.Â  296 S.C. at 492, 374 S.E.2d at 289.Â  At the suppression\r\n  hearing, the agent allegedly promising consolidation testified he discussed\r\n  with Howard the possibility of â€œwrapping up all the charges, but never made any\r\n  promises.â€ Â Id. at 492, 374 S.E.2d at 290.Â  The agent insisted he told\r\n  Howard he would explore the possibility of consolidation, â€œbut [could] not\r\n  promise one thing.â€Â  Id.Â  In holding Howardâ€™s statement was properly\r\n  admitted, the Court emphasized that when evidence of voluntariness is\r\n  conflicting, the trial judge determines the factual issue by the preponderance\r\n  of evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  although Arrowoodâ€™s testimony completely contradicted the officerâ€™s testimony,\r\n  it was within the trial judgeâ€™s province to determine the admissibility of the statements\r\n  by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s determination is not in\r\n  error if there is any evidence in the record to support it.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the record\r\n  contains evidence sufficient to support the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion that\r\n  Arrowoodâ€™s statements were freely and voluntarily given under the totality of\r\n  the circumstances.Â  Accordingly, the admission of Arrowoodâ€™s statements was not\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Arrowoodâ€™s conviction and sentence are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, J., and\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The record on appeal does not fully explain the\r\n  circumstances of Arrowoodâ€™s transfer from Rutherford County, North Carolina to Spartanburg County or the disposition of the charges in North Carolina.Â  \r\n[2] Prior to trial, the State served a notice of a life\r\n  sentence pursuant to section 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code (1976) because\r\n  of Arrowoodâ€™s prior burglary convictions.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4305","title":"State v.

Phillips\r\n  of the Cherokee County Metro Narcotics Unit observed a car swerving repeatedly.Â \r\n  Officer Phillips was prepared that day to work undercover, wearing a Fila\r\n  tee-shirt, a black jacket, and a skull cap. Â After observing the swerving car,\r\n  Officer Phillips initiated a traffic stop in his undercover vehicle, a black\r\n  Pontiac Trans Am with tinted windows. Â He placed a flashing blue light on the\r\n  front dash of his undercover vehicle to initiate the stop. Â The driver, Gault, an\r\n  owner of an automotive repair store, drove several hundred yards and pulled\r\n  over at his place of business. Â While Phillips remained in the car to call in\r\n  the stop to the dispatcher, Gault exited his vehicle and approached the\r\n  officer.Â  Gaultâ€™s demeanor was loud and belligerent according to Phillips, and\r\n  he insisted that Phillips was not an officer even after seeing a badge. Â A\r\n  uniformed officer arrived twelve minutes after Phillips made the initial stop.Â \r\n  He testified to Gaultâ€™s continued belligerence and yelling. Â \r\nGault was charged with reckless driving and public disorderly\r\n  conduct. Â The jury found Gault not guilty of reckless driving and guilty of\r\n  public disorderly conduct. Â He appealed to the circuit court arguing the same\r\n  issues that he presents today. The circuit court affirmed the magistrate court.\r\n  Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  Thus, an appellate\r\n  court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGault\r\n  first argues the circuit court erred in affirming the magistrate courtâ€™s\r\n  decision to deny his motion for directed verdict. Â We disagree. \r\nWhen ruling on a\r\n  motion for directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or\r\n  nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279,\r\n  292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  In reviewing a motion for directed verdict,\r\n  the appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the\r\n  light most favorable to the State. Â Id.\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, evidence exists to support a verdict of public disorderly conduct. Â The\r\n  pertinent part of the public disorderly conduct statute provides that it is a\r\n  misdemeanor for a person to â€œbe found on any highway or at any public place or\r\n  public gathering . . . Â otherwise conducting himself in a disorderly or\r\n  boisterous manner,â€ or to, â€œuse obscene or profane language on any highway or\r\n  at any public place or gathering . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530 (2003). Â Officer Phillips testified that after Gault pulled into his place of\r\n  business, Gault jumped out of his car and screamed, â€œI donâ€™t know you.Â \r\n  Somebody is going to kill you for this.â€Â  He testified that Gault was loudly using\r\n  profanity and repeatedly saying that he looked like a hoodlum.Â  Phillips further\r\n  testified that upon identifying himself as an officer and showing Gault his\r\n  badge, Gault grabbed his badge and pulled Phillips close, saying â€œI donâ€™t know\r\n  you.â€Â  An officer who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter also testified to\r\n  Gaultâ€™s continued belligerent, threatening, and disorderly behavior. Â Because evidence\r\n  exists to support a charge against Gault for public disorderly conduct, the\r\n  magistrate court judge did not err in refusing to direct a verdict. Â \r\nOn appeal to the\r\n  circuit court, Gault also argued that his speech when confronting the officers could\r\n  not constitute public disorderly conduct because it did not rise to the level\r\n  of â€œfighting words,â€ and was therefore protected by the First Amendment\r\n  pursuant to State v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 355, 412 S.E.2d 385, 386\r\n  (1991) (â€œ[A]ppellants cannot be punished under Â§ 16-17-530(a) for voicing their\r\n  objections to sheriffâ€™s officers where the record indicates no use of fighting\r\n  words.â€). Â Gault also advances this argument in his appeal, however, because the\r\n  issue was not raised before the magistrate, it is not preserved for our review.\r\n  Â \r\nIn Gaultâ€™s motion\r\n  for a directed verdict, he made no mention of the First Amendment, Perkins,\r\n  or the â€œfighting wordsâ€ exception. Â Rather, he argued there was no\r\n  evidence that Gault â€œthreatenedâ€ Officer Phillips, and that Gault was rightfully\r\n  agitated because he initially thought Phillips was not a policeman. Â See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005)\r\n  (holding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court\r\n  and another ground is raised on appeal); See In re Care and Treatment\r\n    of Corley, 365 S.C. 252, 258, 616 S.E.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App. 2005) (explaining\r\n  that constitutional issues, like most others, must be raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court to be preserved for appeal). Â \r\nGault next argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in affirming the magistrate courtâ€™s denial of the admission\r\n  of photographs illustrating the dark tint on Officer Phillipsâ€™ windows.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Â State\r\n    v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack\r\n  evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. Â Id.Â  Furthermore, for an error of law to warrant reversal\r\n  based on admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the\r\n  error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a\r\n  reasonable probability the verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or\r\n  the lack thereof. Â Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26,\r\n  609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).\r\nFirst, it is\r\n  unclear to this court how the tint on the officerâ€™s window is relevant.Â  Gault elicited\r\n  testimony regarding Officer Phillipsâ€™ vehicle and attire to show that Gault was\r\n  reasonable in not believing Phillips was a law enforcement officer. Â However, a\r\n  belief that a person is or is not a police officer is not an element of the\r\n  charge of public disorderly conduct. Â Therefore, we find the window-tint\r\n  evidence was properly excluded.\r\nFurther, Gault had\r\n  already testified that the windows were tinted, so the photographs would have\r\n  only served as cumulative evidence.Â  Because the jury was already informed of\r\n  the tinted windows, the exclusion of the photographs showing the tint was not\r\n  prejudicial to Gault.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court was correct in affirming\r\n  the magistrate courtâ€™s exclusion of the evidence. Â See Rule 403, SCRE (allowing\r\n  evidence to be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by considerations\r\n  of needless presentation of cumulative evidence); State v. Hess, 279\r\n  S.C. 14, 18-19, 301 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1983) (finding no abuse of discretion\r\n  where the excluded testimony is merely cumulative of other evidence proffered\r\n  to the jury).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the circuit court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4306","title":"Walton v.

Faile Enterprises, Inc. Â On December 19, 2002, Faile Enterprises entered\r\n  into an asset purchase agreement with McManus and Sigmon.Â  In January 2003,\r\n  Walton brought the vehicle to the dealership for repairs.Â  At that time, Walton\r\n  was informed of the sale, and McManus and Sigmon refused to honor Waltonâ€™s\r\n  contract or warranty.Â  Walton contacted C.A.R.S. expecting it to honor the\r\n  warranty contract.Â  C.A.R.S. notified Walton it never received the paperwork or\r\n  payment from Mazda of Rock Hill.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  sale and transfer of the dealership assets closed on March 27, 2003.Â  On March\r\n  28, 2003, McManus and Sigmon assigned the asset purchase agreement to\r\n  McManus-Sigmon, Inc., a.k.a. Team Mazda.Â   \r\nBy complaint dated\r\n  April 2, 2003, Walton sued Mazda of Rock Hill, Mazda USA, Lee Faile, McManus,\r\n  Sigmon, and C.A.R.S., alleging breach of contract, unfair trade practices, and\r\n  willful and malicious conduct.Â  The magistrate granted McManusâ€™ and Sigmonâ€™s\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis courtâ€™s\r\n  standard of review of a circuit courtâ€™s decision on an appeal from magistrateâ€™s\r\n  court is limited to the correction of errors of law and this court will affirm\r\n  the circuit court if there are any facts supporting its decision.Â  See Bowers\r\n    v. Thomas, 373 S.C. 240, 244-45, 644 S.E.2d 751, 753 (Ct. App. 2007).[2] Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\nWalton\r\n  first argues a magistrate does not have the authority to rule on a motion for\r\n  summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 81, SCRCP,\r\n  provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThese\r\n  rules [SCRCP], or any of them, shall apply to every trial court of civil\r\n  jurisdiction within this state, within the limits of the jurisdiction and\r\n  powers of the court provided by law, and the procedure therein shall conform to\r\n  these rules insofar as practicable. Â They shall apply insofar as practicable in\r\n  magistrateâ€™s courts, probate courts, and family courts to the extent they are\r\n  not inconsistent with the statutes and rules governing those courts.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSee Rule 1, SCRCP (defining the scope of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure) and Rule 56, SCRCP\r\n  (providing the authority to grant summary judgment).  \r\n\r\n\tAdditionally,\r\n  Rule 2, SCRMC, provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) If no\r\n  procedure is provided by these rules, the court shall proceed in a manner\r\n  consistent with the statutory law applicable to magistrates and with circuit\r\n  court practice in like situations but not inconsistent with these rules.\r\n\t\t(b) Each\r\n  magistrate may promulgate rules for the conduct of proceedings in his court\r\n  which are not inconsistent with these rules and the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Laws.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no law within the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Magistrate Court specifically addressing summary judgment, the South\r\n    Carolina Bench Book for Magistrates and Municipal Court Judges discusses\r\n  summary judgment, explaining:\r\n\r\n\tAfter\r\n  the filing of a civil case and prior to the actual trial, you may occasionally\r\n  receive a motion for summary judgment . . . . Â Rule 56, SCRCP, which is made\r\n  applicable to magistrateâ€™s court by Rule 81, SCRCP, allows the plaintiff or defendant . . . [to] move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary\r\n  judgment . . . . Â Summary judgment is proper when, after reviewing the motion,\r\n  supporting affidavits, and the pleadings, there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\r\n  . . . Â If, after a hearing, the court determines the summary judgment is\r\n  appropriate, an order to that effect ending the case should be issued. Â \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Bench Book for Magistrates and Municipal Court\r\n  Judges, II-19 to II-20 (2d\r\n  ed. 1984), available at http://www.sccourts.org/trial/magistrate/benchbook/HTML/CivilC.htm#C15 (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n \r\nTherefore, we find\r\n  Rule 56, SCRCP, applies to magistrates as members of the South Carolina court\r\n  system.Â  The circuit court did not err in affirming the magistrateâ€™s grant of\r\n  summary judgment because the grant of summary judgment does not exceed the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s authority.\r\nII.&nbsp; Successor Liability\r\nWalton\r\n  next contends genuine issues of material fact exist as to successor liability\r\n  and therefore the magistrate erred in granting summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  the absence of a statute, a successor company is not ordinarily liable for the\r\n  debts of a predecessor company under a theory of successor liability unless: (a)\r\n  there was an agreement to assume such debts; (b) the circumstances surrounding\r\n  the transaction indicate a consolidation of the two corporations; (c) the successor\r\n  company was a mere continuation of the predecessor company; or (d) the transaction\r\n  was fraudulently entered into for the purpose of wrongfully denying creditor\r\n  claims.Â  Simmons v. Mark Lift Indus., 366 S.C. 308, 312, 622 S.E.2d 213,\r\n  215 (2005) (citing Brown v. American Ry. Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123\r\n  S.E. 97&nbsp;(1924)).\r\n(a)&nbsp; Agreement to\r\n  Assume Obligations Exception\r\nWalton\r\n  alleges an issue of material fact is present regarding whether McManus and\r\n  Sigmon agreed to assume Mazda of Rock Hillâ€™s debts or obligations.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen\r\n  a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions according to the\r\n  terms the parties used, understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Oates, 356 S.C. 378, 381, 588 S.E.2d\r\n  643, 645&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Asset Purchase Agreement states that McManus and Sigmon purchased the assets\r\n  â€œfree and clear of any liens, encumbrances, restrictions, charges, and equities\r\n  of any kind whatsoever.â€Â  Further, the Asset Purchase Agreement states: Â â€œPurchaser\r\n  is not assuming any liabilities of Seller.â€Â  Walton focuses on language in the\r\n  Asset Purchase Agreement that obliges McManus and Sigmon to purchase, at cost, all\r\n  repair work in progress.Â  Under this provision, McManus and Sigmon were to\r\n  finish customer repair work, and the proceeds were to be divided equally between\r\n  the parties. Â We agree with the magistrate and circuit court that this\r\n  provision, in light of the other provisions in the contract, does not convert\r\n  the agreement from solely an asset sale to a sale of assets and liabilities.Â \r\n  Therefore, Waltonâ€™s reliance on this provision is misplaced and the magistrate\r\n  did not err in finding no genuine issues of material fact exist regarding this\r\n  exception.\r\n(b)&nbsp; Consolidation\r\n  Exception\r\nWalton\r\n  argues there is a material issue of fact whether the sale between Mazda of Rock\r\n  Hill and McManus and Sigmon was simply a consolidation.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  the circuit court properly determined, there is no evidence in the record\r\n  indicating the transaction between Mazda of Rock Hill and McManus and Sigmon amounted\r\n  to a consolidation. Â Both McManus and Sigmon signed affidavits swearing they\r\n  have never had any interest in Mazda of Rock Hill.Â  The asset purchase agreement\r\n  clearly establishes a sale between Faile Enterprises and McManus and Sigmon.Â \r\n  The agreement was also subject to a consultant and non-compete agreement, in\r\n  which Faile promised not to associate with any Mazda dealership within twenty\r\n  miles of the sold dealership and to work as a consultant for McManus and Sigmon\r\n  for almost two years.Â  Accordingly, no factual issue prevents summary judgment based\r\n  on this exception.  \r\n(c)&nbsp; Mere Continuation Exception\r\nWalton\r\n  asserts a material issue of fact exists as to whether McManus and Sigmon merely\r\n  continued Mazda of Rock Hill.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Simmons\r\n  v. Mark Lift Industries, Inc., the South Carolina Supreme Court declined to\r\n  extend the mere continuation exception to situations where there is no\r\n  commonality between officers, directors, and shareholders of the seller and\r\n  purchaser.Â  366 S.C. 308, 312 n.1, 622 S.E.2d 213, 215 n.1 (2005). Â As\r\n  discussed, McManus and Sigmon did not have any relationship with Mazda of Rock\r\n  Hill except for the purchase of the assets of the dealership.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Faile only served McManusâ€™ and Sigmonâ€™s new organization, Team Mazda, as a\r\n  consultant for a limited time period.Â  Therefore, we find evidence to support\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding that there was no material issue of fact supporting\r\n  Waltonâ€™s claim of a mere continuation.Â   \r\n(d)&nbsp; Fraud\r\n  Exception\r\nFinally, Walton\r\n  contends there is an issue of material fact regarding whether the asset sale\r\n  was fraudulent.Â  To meet the fraud exception to successor liability, the\r\n  general rule is that a successor must knowingly participate in a fraudulent\r\n  asset transfer.Â  Richard L. Cupp, Jr., Redesigning Successor Liability,\r\n  1999 U.Ill.L.Rev. 845, 875-76 (1999).Â  Proving such knowledge is difficult, and\r\n  a few courts have advocated expanding the fraud section to include reviewing\r\n  the successorâ€™s actual or constructive knowledge.Â  Id. at 888-89\r\n  (generally discussing the fraud exception in product liability actions alleging\r\n  successor liability).Â  Under either interpretation of the fraud exception to\r\n  successor liability, we find no genuine issue of material fact.Â  Walton\r\n  provides no theory supporting a claim of fraud.Â  For instance, there is no\r\n  evidence of inadequate consideration and no indication that McManus and Sigmon\r\n  were not bona fide purchasers for value.Â  A party opposing summary judgment\r\n  must do more than rely on mere allegations.Â  Dyer v. Moss, 284 S.C. 208,\r\n  211, 325 S.E.2d 69, 70 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  We find no error by the trial court in\r\n  affirming the magistrateâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the fraud exception.Â  \r\n \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the masterâ€™s\r\n  grant of summary judgment in favor of McManus and Sigmon.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; The circuit courtâ€™s standard of review of a magistrateâ€™s order is not at\r\n  issue in this case.Â  See S.C.

Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), to determine the voluntariness and\r\n  admissibility of Millerâ€™s oral and written statements.Â  The following colloquy\r\n  occurred during the cross-examination of agent Oâ€™Neil at the Denno hearing:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  When you initially sat down with Mr. Miller, not saying there\r\n  was an agreement or anything, but was there a general discussion with Mr.\r\n  Miller that if he would admit his involvement and fully cooperate that it was a\r\n  possibility, not an agreement, that he could get a sentence of approximately\r\n  fifteen years?\r\n\tA:Â  No.\r\n\tQ: Okay.Â  Was there any discussion of fifteen years at that point\r\n  in time? Iâ€™m not saying an agreement, but a general discussion?\r\n\tA:Â  I told Mr. Miller that all he could do by cooperating was help\r\n  himself, it was not going to hurt him.Â  I did not refer to a particular time or\r\n  to a sentence that he could possibly receive.Â  I repeated several times, as I\r\n  always do, that itâ€™s up to the judge that handles the case. \r\n\r\nVarner testified on Millerâ€™s behalf during the Denno hearing\r\n  and claimed Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Evans orally promised a plea\r\n  deal of eight to twelve years in exchange for Millerâ€™s guilty plea and full\r\n  cooperation with the investigation.Â  However, Varner admitted he never memorialized\r\n  the promise in writing.Â  Varner contended Miller gave statements to authorities\r\n  in reliance on the alleged eight-to-twelve-year deal.Â  Although Varner averred he\r\n  communicated the details of the agreement to Miller in front of Bragg and\r\n  Sonnefeld, neither agent recalled the number of years being mentioned.Â  The\r\n  following colloquy occurred during the cross-examination of Bragg at the Denno hearing:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  And whether I misunderstood it or whether it was correct or\r\n  not, do you recall me telling Marshall Miller, â€œMarshall, I just got off the\r\n  phone with Jennifer [Evans].Â  If you testify or you give your cooperation,â€\r\n  that, â€œyou are in the eight to twelve range and expect twelve . . . you donâ€™t\r\n  have to do this, this is your choice, youâ€™re freely and voluntarily entering\r\n  into this, this is going to be your decision if you will take that range,â€\r\n  whether I misunderstood my statement with [Evans] or whether that was correct\r\n  or even if that was a lie, do you recall me making the statement to [Miller] to\r\n  that effect?\r\n\tA:Â  I do not recall any numbers being mentioned at all.\r\n\r\nTo the same line\r\n  of questioning, Sonnefeld responded, â€œI donâ€™t remember numbers.Â  I remember\r\n  that if he cooperated it would be taken into consideration.â€Â   \r\nEvans explained the only offer she extended was a formal, written\r\n  plea agreement with a fifteen-year sentence.Â  She denied offering a plea with a\r\n  sentence in the range of eight to twelve years.Â  In contrariety, Varner asserted\r\n  Miller would not have provided information for a fifteen-year deal. Â â€œ[Miller] has been in jail a couple of times, this\r\n  gentleman is very jailhouse smart, he does know how to handle himself in that\r\n  respect, heâ€™s very familiar with the system, so to speak . . . .â€Â  The following colloquy occurred during the\r\n  direct examination of Evans:\r\n\r\n\tA:Â  The only time we ever make plea offers is when we send out\r\n  formal written plea offers.Â  What we do, we explain to them what we expect with\r\n  cooperation, which is full cooperation, full debriefing, cooperation throughout\r\n  the investigation, and at that point there is nothing promised except for the\r\n  fact that we will take that cooperation into account.Â  Mr. Miller was indicted\r\n  for a 25 year offense . . . we do explain to them there is really no way you\r\n  can hurt yourself at this point, that we take the cooperation into account in\r\n  determining a sentence, but I donâ€™t discuss sentencing and I donâ€™t discuss what\r\n  they would be, because I donâ€™t know at that point what they know and if they\r\n  are going to be fully honest with us.\r\n\tQ:Â  So, it would be safe to say, then, you have to get all the information\r\n  from the defendant before you can even determine what offer you want to make\r\n  them?\r\n\tA:Â  That is certainly the course of action that we do in all of\r\n  our Grand Jury cases. \r\n\tQ:Â  And is this particular instance did you make a written plea\r\n  offer?\r\n\tA: Â Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  written plea offer was sent to Miller on April 29, 2003, in which the State\r\n  offered a recommendation of fifteen years for him to plead guilty and fully\r\n  cooperate.Â  Miller had two opportunities to plead guilty but declined to do\r\n  so.Â   \r\nMiller moved to enforce the purported eight-to-twelve-year plea\r\n  agreement.Â  The trial judge found Millerâ€™s statements were voluntary and denied\r\n  his motion to enforce the plea agreement.Â  Miller failed to appear for trial\r\n  and was tried in his absence.Â  The jury found him guilty and the trial\r\n  judge imposed a twenty-five-year sentence.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  Thus, an appellate court is bound\r\n  by the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.; State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472, 613 S.E.2d 381, 384 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The appellate courts are â€œbound by fact findings in response to motions\r\n  preliminary to trial when the findings are supported by the evidence and not\r\n  clearly wrong or controlled by error of law.â€Â  Reed v. Becka, 333 S.C.\r\n  676, 685, 511 S.E.2d 396, 401 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing State v. Amerson,\r\n  311 S.C. 316, 320, 428 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1993)).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge determines the admissibility of a statement upon proof of its\r\n  voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. Â State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 55, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988); State v. Smith, 268 S.C. 349, 354, 234 S.E.2d 19, 21\r\n  (1977).Â  The jury must determine whether the statement was freely and\r\n  voluntarily given beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Washington, 296 S.C. at 55-56, 370 S.E.2d at 612.Â  On appeal, the conclusion of the trial judge as to the\r\n  voluntariness of a statement will not be reversed unless so erroneous as to\r\n  show an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 242,\r\n  471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996).Â  When\r\n  reviewing a trial judgeâ€™s ruling concerning voluntariness, the appellate court\r\n  does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is\r\n  supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551\r\n  S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMiller argues his\r\n  statements made to law enforcement were given in reliance upon the promise of\r\n  leniency, and therefore, were involuntary and inadmissible.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nI.&nbsp; Voluntariness of\r\n  Statements to SLED Agents\r\nThe process for determining whether a\r\n  statement is voluntary, and thus admissible, is bifurcated; it involves\r\n  determinations by both the judge and the jury.Â  First, the trial judge must\r\n  conduct an evidentiary hearing, outside the presence of the jury, where the\r\n  State must show the statement was voluntarily made by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Jackson\r\n    v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376 (1964).Â  If the\r\n  statement is found to have been given voluntarily, it is then submitted to the\r\n  jury, where its voluntariness must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State\r\n    v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 56, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988).\r\na.&nbsp; Admissibility of\r\n  Statements\r\nA statement\r\n  obtained as a result of custodial interrogation is inadmissible unless the\r\n  suspect was advised of and voluntarily waived his rights.Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 498-500 (1966); State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551\r\n  S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001). Â If a suspect was advised of his Miranda rights\r\n  but made a statement, the â€œburden is on the State to prove by a preponderance\r\n  of the evidence that his rights were voluntarily waived.â€Â  Saltz, 346 at\r\n  135, 551 S.E.2d at 252; State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990); State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 55, 370 S.E.2d\r\n  611, 612 (1988). Â A statement is not admissible unless it was voluntarily\r\n  made.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243, 471 S.E.2d 689, 694\r\n  (1996); State v. Compton, 366 S.C. 671, 680, 623 S.E.2d 661, 666 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005); see also State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 475, 385\r\n  S.E.2d 839, 842 (1989) (â€œThe test of admissibility of a statement is voluntariness.â€).Â  This voluntariness requirement is in addition to the\r\n  intelligent waiver mandate of Miranda.Â  See State v. Middleton,\r\n  288 S.C. 21, 25, 339 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1986) (â€œIn order to secure the admission\r\n  of a defendantâ€™s statement, the State must affirmatively show the statement was\r\n  voluntary and taken in compliance with Miranda.â€) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  â€œIt is now axiomatic . . . that a defendant in a criminal case is\r\n  deprived of due process of law if his conviction is founded, in whole or in\r\n  part, upon an involuntary [statement], without regard for the truth or falsity\r\n  of the [statement] . . . even though there is ample evidence aside from the\r\n  [statement] to support the conviction.â€Â  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376 (1964).\r\nThe requirement\r\n  that only voluntary statements be admitted is based on the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s\r\n  right against self-incrimination, and was incorporated and made applicable to\r\n  the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  See Malloy v. Hogan,\r\n  378 U.S. 1, 6 (1964) (â€œWe hold today that the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s exception from\r\n  compulsory self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n  against abridgment by the States.â€).Â  In State v. Hook, this Court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in\r\n  relevant part, that no person â€œshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\r\n  witness against himself.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. V. This provision governs state\r\n  as well as federal criminal proceedings.Â  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964).Â  Article 1, Section 12, of the South Carolina Constitution contains a\r\n  similar provision.Â  S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 12 (â€œ. . . nor shall any person be\r\n  compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.â€).\r\n\tThe Fifth Amendment does not, of course, operate as a blanket\r\n  prohibition against the taking of any and all statements made by criminal\r\n  defendants to law enforcement officials.Â  Volunteered statements, whether\r\n  exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation or\r\n  spontaneously offered up, are not barred by the Fifth Amendment.Â  State v.\r\n    Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 307, 479 S.E.2d 838, 844 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing \r\n\tMiranda\r\n      v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)).\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Hook, 348 S.C. 401, 409-10, 559 S.E.2d 856,\r\n  860 (Ct. App. 2001), affâ€™d as modified, 356 S.C. 421, 590 S.E.2d 25\r\n  (2003).Â  We\r\n  observed that the â€œconcept that the privilege against self-incrimination\r\n  encompasses the right to be free from being penalized for its exercise is well\r\n  established.â€Â  Id. at 411, 559 S.E.2d at 861 (quoting Lefkowitz v.\r\n    Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801 (1977) (â€œ[W]hen a State compels testimony by\r\n  threatening to inflict potent\r\n  sanctions unless the constitutional privilege is surrendered, that testimony is\r\n  obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment and cannot be used against the\r\n  declarant in a subsequent criminal prosecution. . . . Â Similarly, our cases\r\n  have established that a State may not impose substantial penalties because a\r\n  witness elects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating\r\n  testimony against himself.â€)). Â The United States Supreme Court, in Jackson\r\n    v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), elucidated the rationales behind the\r\n  prohibition against involuntary statements:\r\n\r\n\tIt\r\n  is now inescapably clear that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the use of\r\n  involuntary [statements] not only because of the probable unreliability of [statements]\r\n  that are obtained in a manner deemed coercive, but also because of the\r\n  â€˜strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are\r\n  sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a\r\n  conviction, wrings a [statement] out of an accused against his will,â€™ and\r\n  because of â€˜the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while\r\n  enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from\r\n  illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the\r\n  actual criminals themselves.â€™ \r\n\r\n378\r\n  U.S. at 385-86 (citations omitted).\r\nb. Voluntariness\r\n  Determination\r\nUnder Jackson v. Denno, a defendant is entitled to a â€œreliable determination\r\n  as to the voluntariness of his [statement] by a tribunal other than the jury\r\n  charged with deciding his guilt or innocence.â€Â  State v. Fortner, 266\r\n  S.C. 223, 226, 222 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1976).Â  â€œIn South Carolina, the judge makes\r\n  this initial determination of voluntariness required by Jackson v. Denno[.]â€Â  Id. Â \r\nâ€œA\r\n  defendant in a criminal case is entitled to an independent evidentiary hearing\r\n  to determine the voluntariness of statements made by the defendant prior to the\r\n  submission of such statements to the jury.â€ Â State v.

Peake, 291 S.C. 138, 139, 352 S.E.2d 487, 488\r\n  (1987).Â   \r\nIn Peake,\r\n  our state supreme court held a defendantâ€™s statements made to an investigating\r\n  officer were induced by a promise of leniency because the officer told the\r\n  defendant the State would not seek the death penalty if he made a statement.Â \r\n  291 S.C. at 139, 352 S.E.2d at 488.Â  However, in Rochester, the supreme\r\n  court found a statement made by a polygraph examiner was not an inducement by\r\n  the promise of leniency.Â  The examinerâ€™s statement simply conveyed that it\r\n  would be in the defendantâ€™s best interest to tell the truth.Â  301 S.C. at 201,\r\n  391 S.E.2d at 247.Â  The Rochester court further noted, â€œ[S]tanding\r\n  alone, the polygraph examinerâ€™s comment did not constitute the kind of hope or\r\n  reward or benefit condemned by this Court in Peake.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the case sub judice, Miller maintains his statements were not freely and voluntarily given\r\n  because they were induced by a promise of an eight to twelve year sentence.Â \r\n  However, Miller was not present to testify, and the only person who testified\r\n  at the Denno hearing that the promise existed was Varner, Millerâ€™s\r\n  attorney.Â  Unlike the circumstances in Peake, in this instance three\r\n  officers and Assistant Attorney General Evans denied any promise of leniency in\r\n  exchange for Millerâ€™s statements.Â  Although the officers and Evans told Miller\r\n  it was in his best interest to cooperate, no one made any direct or implied\r\n  promise of leniency.Â  As a result, Millerâ€™s statements were made in the â€œhopeâ€\r\n  of leniency rather than as a consequence of a â€œpromise.â€Â  Â \r\nIn ruling on the\r\n  admissibility of Millerâ€™s statements, the trial judge had the opportunity in\r\n  the Denno hearing to listen to the testimony, assess the demeanor and\r\n  credibility of all witnesses, and weigh the evidence accordingly.Â  In\r\n  determining Miller knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made the statements\r\n  the trial judge ruled:Â   \r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  [c]ourt cannot conclude that the statements to Agents Bragg and Sonnefeld were\r\n  not freely voluntarily given after Mr. Miller was afforded all of his rights,\r\n  warning and safeguards pursuant to the case law in such cases made and\r\n  provided, or that the handwritten statement was not freely and voluntarily\r\n  given.\r\n\tFurthermore, the\r\n  court instructed the jury to\r\n\tcarefully\r\n  scrutinize all the surrounding circumstances about and concerning such\r\n  statement or statements before you give any weight to any alleged statement of\r\n  statements.Â  You must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement\r\n  was made by the accused person uninfluenced by promise of reward, threats of\r\n  injury or diminution of his rights. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge analyzed\r\n  the voluntariness of Millerâ€™s statements in compliance with the due process\r\n  requirements. Â Luculently, the admission of Millerâ€™s statements at trial was\r\n  not an abuse of discretion.  \r\nII.&nbsp; Enforceability of\r\n  Plea Offer\r\nMiller next contends\r\n  the promise of an eight-to-twelve-year sentence should have been enforced.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Miller claims the Stateâ€™s oral promise of eight-to-twelve years was binding\r\n  because he detrimentally relied on it by disclosing the information the State\r\n  wanted.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nâ€œ[I]t is the\r\n  prerogative of any person to waive his rights, confess, and plead guilty, under\r\n  judicially defined safeguards, which are adequately enforced.â€Â  Reed v.\r\n    Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 685, 511 S.E.2d 396, 401 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Armstrong, 263 S.C. 594, 597, 211 S.E.2d 889, 890 (1975).Â \r\n  However, a defendant has no constitutional right to plea bargain.Â  Reed,\r\n  333 S.C. at 685, 511 S.E.2d at 401.Â  Furthermore, the trial judge is not\r\n  required to accept a plea.Â  Id.; see also Santabello v.\r\n    New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971) (stating defendant has no absolute\r\n  right to have a guilty plea accepted).Â  However, once a defendant enters a\r\n  guilty plea and the plea is accepted by the court, due process requires the\r\n  plea bargain be honored.Â  Reed, 333 S.C. at 686, 511 S.E.2d at 401.Â  \r\n \r\nWhile\r\n  plea agreements are a matter of criminal jurisprudence, most courts have held\r\n  they are subject to contract principles.Â  See, eg, Â Reed v.\r\n    Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 686, 511 S.E.2d 396, 401 (Ct. App. 1999); United\r\n      States v. Ringling, 988 F.2d 504, 505 (4th Cir. 1993); United States v.\r\n        Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 300 (4th Cir. 1986) (â€œ[I]n the process of determining\r\n  whether disputed plea agreements have been formed or performed, courts have\r\n  necessarily drawn on the most relevant body of developed rules and principles\r\n  of private law, those pertaining to the formation and interpretation of\r\n  commercial contracts.â€).Â  Unless intended by both parties, terms or conditions\r\n  should not be read into a plea agreement.Â  State v. Compton, 366 S.C.\r\n  671, 678, 623 S.E.2d 661, 665 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Until performance occurs,\r\n  parties are free to withdraw their offers.Â  Reed, 333 S.C. at 687, 511\r\n  S.E.2d at 402.Â   \r\nA\r\n  plea agreement is only an â€œofferâ€ until the defendant enters a court-approved guilty\r\n  plea.Â  Id. at 688, 511 S.E.2d at 403.Â  A defendant accepts the â€œofferâ€\r\n  by pleading guilty.Â  Id.Â  Until formal acceptance has occurred, the plea\r\n  is not binding on the defendant, the State, or the court.Â  Id.Â  This\r\n  general rule is subject to a detrimental reliance exception.Â  Custodio v.\r\n    State, 373 S.C. 4, 11, 644 S.E.2d 36, 39 (2007); Reed, 333 S.C. at\r\n  688, 511 S.E.2d at 403.Â  The fact that an agreement was oral does not prevent\r\n  possible enforcement.Â  Id.Â  Absent a plea of guilt, a defendant may\r\n  enforce an oral plea agreement upon a showing of detrimental reliance.Â  Id.Â  Even if the agreement has not been finalized by the court, a defendantâ€™s\r\n  detrimental reliance on a promise in plea-bargaining may make a plea binding.Â  Id.Â  A defendant who provides beneficial information to law enforcement can be said\r\n  to have relied to his detriment.Â  Id.\r\nState prosecutors\r\n  are obligated to fulfill the promises they make to defendants when those\r\n  promises serve as inducements to defendants to plead guilty.Â  Santabello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971).Â  South Carolina has recognized the principles set\r\n  forth in Santabello; when an accused pleads guilty upon the promise of a\r\n  prosecutor, the agreement must be fulfilled.Â  See Sprouse v. State, 355\r\n  S.C. 335, 338, 585 S.E.2d 278, 280 (2003); State v. Thrift, 312 S.C.\r\n  282, 292, 440 S.E.2d 341, 347 (1994); see also State v. Mathis,\r\n  287 S.C. 589, 592, 340 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1986) (â€œThe public interest of\r\n  encouraging settlement of criminal cases without necessity of trial favors\r\n  permitting an accused to plead guilty to the offense charged without\r\n  prejudicing his position if it is later withdrawn.â€) (quoting State v.\r\n    Wright, 436 P.2d 601, 604-05 (1968)).\r\nHowever, a\r\n  defendant may not attempt to create a firm commitment out of plea\r\n  negotiations.Â  State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 49, 476 S.E.2d 683, 687\r\n  (2007).Â  The State is not bound to accept a defendantâ€™s terms simply because a\r\n  defendant reveals otherwise undiscoverable facts in the hope of securing a\r\n  favorable plea agreement.Â  Id.; State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1,\r\n  292 S.E.2d 581 (1982), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 938 (1982) (holding\r\n  solicitorâ€™s plea negotiations to consider life sentence did not prevent State\r\n  from seeking death penalty) overruled in part on other grounds by State\r\n    v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â   \r\nIn Whipple,\r\n  the court concluded no plea agreement was reached when a solicitor told Whipple\r\n  he would consider, not promise, a life sentence if substantial mitigating\r\n  evidence was demonstrated.Â  324 S.C. at 48, 476 S.E.2d at 686.Â  Contrastively,\r\n  in Custodio, all of the evidence presented conclusively showed that an\r\n  agreement between the defendant and solicitor existed.Â  373 S.C. at 10, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 38.Â  The court ruled Custodio fully cooperated by providing helpful\r\n  information in reliance on the solicitorâ€™s assurances of a fifteen-year\r\n  sentence cap and was therefore entitled to have the agreement enforced.Â  Id. at 12, 644 S.E.2d at 39.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the evidence indicates the communications between Evans and\r\n  Varner about an eight-to-twelve-year sentence never reached the level of a\r\n  promise or agreement. Â Evans testified the protocol in grand jury cases was to formally,\r\n  in writing, extend a plea offer after the defendant was debriefed and the\r\n  desired information obtained. Â In accordance with that practice, the only offer\r\n  Evans ever made Miller was a written plea agreement for fifteen years.Â   \r\nDiscussions\r\n  between Evans and Varner about a range of potential sentences prior to Millerâ€™s\r\n  debriefing were plea negotiations and cannot be construed as an â€œoffer.â€Â  Nothing\r\n  in the testimony indicates Evans ever intended to agree to an eight-to-twelve-year\r\n  plea. Â Miller was not present at trial and never expressed his understanding of\r\n  the terms of the alleged â€œdeal.â€Â  Furthermore, Miller never accepted a plea offer\r\n  by entering a guilty plea.Â  Admittedly, Miller revealed information in the hope\r\n  of securing a favorable plea.Â  Nevertheless, without an affirmative promise or\r\n  plea offer from the State of eight to twelve years, Millerâ€™s cooperation did\r\n  not bind the State to accept his terms. Â \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  find the trial judge did not err in declining to enforce the alleged\r\n  eight-to-twelve-year agreement.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the trial court did not err in admitting Millerâ€™s oral and written\r\n  statements at trial, because they were knowingly, intelligently, and\r\n  voluntarily made.Â  We rule the evidentiary record does NOT contain an\r\n  enforceable plea agreement.Â  The conviction and sentence of Miller are  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4308","title":"Hutto v.

Carter, of Columbia, for\r\n  Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Lance S. Boozer, Assistant Attorney General Paula Magargle,\r\n  and John Benjamin Aplin, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.: Â Tommy Hutto was convicted of first-degree burglary, first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, and armed robbery. The trial court sentenced Hutto to 30 years\r\n  each for the first-degree criminal sexual conduct and armed robbery charges and\r\n  life imprisonment for the burglary charge. The post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  court denied Huttoâ€™s request for relief and we granted certiorari.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  the early morning hours of July 16, 1998, Victim, a 90-year-old woman, awoke to\r\n  the sound of someone breaking the glass in her door.Â Â  Victim saw a man enter\r\n  her home. The intruder accidentally cut himself while attempting to gain entry\r\n  into Victimâ€™s home. Victim grabbed a loaded rifle in order to confront the\r\n  intruder, but the intruder wrestled it away from her. Victimâ€™s assailant robbed,\r\n  sexually assaulted her, and burglarized her home before leaving.  \r\nOn August 1, 1998, Huttoâ€™s\r\n  probation agent, accompanied by probation agent James Harris, visited Hutto on\r\n  a routine visit to verify Huttoâ€™s address.Â During the home visit, Harris\r\n  noticed lacerations on Huttoâ€™s arms and hands.Â   \r\nHubert\r\n  Nimau, the police investigator handling Victimâ€™s case, issued a â€œbe on the\r\n  lookoutâ€ notice requesting information regarding suspects fitting the following\r\n  profile: Caucasian male, approximately 24 to 25 years old, 5â€™8â€ tall, weighing 130\r\n  pounds, short dark hair, and has fresh cuts or lacerations to his arms and\r\n  hands. Believing Hutto could fit the description, Harris disclosed his\r\n  observations of Huttoâ€™s lacerations to Nimau.Â  Â Nimau, utilizing information\r\n  from Harris as well as other information independently received in response to a\r\n  crime watchers news article, prepared a lineup which included Huttoâ€™s picture. Victim\r\n  identified Hutto as her assailant by selecting his picture out of the lineup.\r\n \r\nBased\r\n  on this identification, Nimau obtained a search warrant for Huttoâ€™s blood.\r\n  Nimau executed the search warrant and a nurse obtained Huttoâ€™s blood for\r\n  testing pursuant to the warrant.Â  A forensic DNA analyst at the South Carolina\r\n  Law Enforcement Division, compared Huttoâ€™s DNA with DNA samples taken from the crime\r\n  scene at Victimâ€™s house. The DNA samples taken from the crime scene, including\r\n  cuttings taken from Victimâ€™s pajama bottoms, matched Huttoâ€™s DNA.[1]Â   \r\nHutto\r\n  was indicted for armed robbery, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree,\r\n  and burglary in the first degree.Â  On November 3, 1999, a jury found Hutto\r\n  guilty of all three charges. The trial judge sentenced Hutto to thirty years\r\n  imprisonment for the armed robbery charge, thirty years imprisonment for\r\n  criminal sexual conduct, and life imprisonment for the burglary charge, with\r\n  the sentences set to run concurrently. Hutto appealed his convictions to our\r\n  court and we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.Â  See State v. Hutto, Op. No. 2002-UP-395 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 4, 2002).Â  \r\n \r\nHutto\r\n  applied for PCR and, after a hearing, the PCR judge denied Huttoâ€™s request for\r\n  relief. Â Hutto appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œTo\r\n  establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must\r\n  prove: (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under\r\n  prevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance\r\n  prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.â€Â  Custodio v. State, 373 S.C. 4, 9, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 36, 38 (2007).Â  â€œJudicial scrutiny of counselâ€™s performance is highly\r\n  deferential and the court must â€˜indulge a strong presumption that counselâ€™s\r\n  conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . .\r\n  .â€™ â€ Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 598, 627 S.E.2d 701, 707 (2006)\r\n  (quoting Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 445, 334 S.E.2d 813, 816\r\n  (1985)).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court will sustain the PCR judgeâ€™s factual findings and conclusions regarding\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel if there is any probative evidence to support\r\n  those findings.â€Â  Jackson v. State, 329 S.C. 345, 348, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  768, 769 (1998).Â  â€œHowever, if there is no probative evidence to support the\r\n  PCR judgeâ€™s findings, the findings will not be upheld.â€Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  addition, our court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision if it is controlled\r\n  by an error of law.Â  Suber\r\n    v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWe\r\n  granted certiorari to address whether Huttoâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for\r\n  not moving to suppress the evidence presented against Hutto on the basis of an improper\r\n  disclosure by a probation agent.\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  24-21-290 of the South Carolina Code provides as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tInformation received by probation agents privileged.\r\n\t\tAll\r\n  information and data obtained in the discharge of his official duty by a\r\n  probation agent is privileged information, is not receivable as evidence in a\r\n  court, and may not be disclosed directly or indirectly to anyone other than the\r\n  judge or others entitled under this chapter to receive reports unless ordered\r\n  by the court or the director.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-21-290 (2007).\r\nOn appeal, Hutto argues Harris disclosed privileged observations\r\n  made in the discharge of his official duties as a probation agent without\r\n  having obtained proper authorization pursuant to section 24-21-290 to disclose\r\n  that information. In addition, Hutto complains that Harris improperly testified\r\n  about his observations in violation of the statute.Â  Furthermore, Hutto reasons\r\n  that the evidence gained as a result of the unauthorized disclosure,\r\n  specifically Victimâ€™s identification of Hutto from the line-up and the DNA\r\n  evidence obtained as a result of the identification, should be excluded as\r\n  fruits of the poisonous tree.\r\n  Based on all of the above, Hutto contends his trial counsel was ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to the admission of this evidence pursuant to section\r\n  24-21-290.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  main purpose of the exclusionary rule is the deterrence of police misconduct.Â  State\r\n    v. Harvin, 345 S.C. 190, 194, 547 S.E.2d 497, 500 (2001).Â  â€œIn the context\r\n  of the application of the exclusionary rule, our supreme court held the\r\n  â€˜exclusion of evidence should be limited to violations of constitutional rights\r\n  and not to statutory violations, at least where the appellant cannot\r\n  demonstrate prejudice at trial resulting from the failure to follow statutory\r\n  procedures.â€™ â€Â  State v. Sheldon, 344 S.C. 340, 343, 543 S.E.2d 585, 586\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting State v. Chandler, 267 S.C. 138, 226 S.E.2d 553\r\n  (1976)).\r\nâ€œThe â€˜fruit of the poisonous\r\n  treeâ€™ doctrine provides that evidence must be excluded if it would not have\r\n  come to light but for the illegal actions of the police, and the evidence has\r\n  been obtained by the exploitation of that illegality.â€Â  State v. Copeland,\r\n  321 S.C. 318, 323, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996).Â  The challenged evidence is\r\n  admissible, however, if it was obtained from a lawful source independent of the\r\n  illegal conduct.Â  Id.\r\nAddressing\r\n  Huttoâ€™s argument concerning the probation officerâ€™s disclosure, the PCR judge found\r\n  Huttoâ€™s counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue to the trial\r\n  court.Â  The court held that, even if counsel was deficient, Hutto could not\r\n  demonstrate that his counselâ€™s failure prejudiced the outcome of the case. The\r\n  court reasoned that â€œ24-21-290 [does not] require the exclusion of any\r\n  subsequent evidence obtained as a result of an improper disclosure.â€Â  The PCR\r\n  judge explained in his order that â€œeven if trial counsel did move to exclude\r\n  evidence pursuant to statute 24-21-290, the trial court would only have been\r\n  obliged to exclude any testimony about the cuts on the Applicantâ€™s hands.â€\r\n \r\nThe\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  Catawba\r\n    Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751,\r\n  753 (2007).Â  We hold that\r\n  Harrisâ€™s observations of Huttoâ€™s scratches do not constitute the kind of information\r\n  or data considered privileged under section 24-21-290.Â  The statuteâ€™s title\r\n  indicates that for information or data to be privileged under section 24-21-290,\r\n  it must be â€œreceivedâ€ by a probation agent.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines the\r\n  word â€œreceiveâ€ as to â€œtake into possession and control; accept custody of.â€Â  1433 (4th ed. 1968).Â  This definition infers a transfer or transmission.Â  We find\r\n  that Hutto has failed to show how Harris â€œreceivedâ€ information or data by\r\n  merely observing the wounds on Huttoâ€™s hands and arms.Â  We believe this\r\n  interpretation is in keeping with the legislative intent and would not\r\n  undermine the statuteâ€™s purpose.Â  See 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 366, at 339-40 (2002) (â€œ[I]n some\r\n  jurisdictions, a statutory\r\n  privilege [attaches] to information and data obtained in the discharge of\r\n  official duties by probation and parole agents, the purpose of which is to\r\n  permit interviewees to express themselves fully without fear of disclosure or\r\n  reprisal.â€).\r\nMoreover, Nimau explained during his in camera testimony that he included Huttoâ€™s picture in the lineup after receiving\r\n  information from two sources: Harris and a tip made in response to a crime\r\n  watchersâ€™ newspaper article. Regardless of whether or not Harrisâ€™s observations\r\n  constitute â€œinformation and dataâ€ under section 24-21-290, the record indicates\r\n  Nimau had sufficient justification to include Huttoâ€™s picture in the lineup\r\n  independently of Harrisâ€™s information.Â  As such, Harrisâ€™s disclosure to Nimau\r\n  was not the only reason Hutto appeared in the lineup, and therefore we find no\r\n  reason to exclude Victimâ€™s identification of Hutto or the DNA evidence obtained\r\n  through a search warrant based on that identification.[2]Â  To exclude the evidence would place\r\n  the police in a worse position than they otherwise would have been.Â  See Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 443 (1984) (â€œThe independent source\r\n  doctrine teaches us that the interest of society in deterring unlawful police\r\n  conduct and the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence\r\n  of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the same, not a\r\n  worse, position that they would have been in if no police error or misconduct\r\n  had occurred.â€).[3]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., and CURETON and GOOLSBY, AJJ, concur\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Dr. Taylor testified â€œthat the probability of\r\n  selecting an unrelated person from the general population at random having a\r\n  DNA profile matching the items that I analyzed, the swabs from the house and\r\n  the cutting from the pajama bottom, is approximately 1 in 12 trillion blacks and\r\n  1 in 500 billion Caucasians.â€  \r\n[2]Â  We are authorized to consider any sustaining ground\r\n  found within the record.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court\r\n  may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the\r\n  Record on Appeal.â€).Â  See also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.\r\n    Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (â€œThe appellate court may review\r\n  respondentâ€™s additional reasons and, if convinced it is proper and fair to do\r\n  so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm the\r\n  lower courtâ€™s judgment.â€).\r\n[3]Â  We note the alleged violations of section 24-21-290 stemmed\r\n  from the actions of a probation agent rather than a police officer.Â  â€œA probation\r\n  agent has, in the execution of his duties, the . . . powers of arrest, and, to\r\n  the extent necessary, the same right to execute process given by law to sheriffs.\r\n  A probation agent has the power and authority to enforce the criminal laws of\r\n  the State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-280(b) (2007). Â However, â€œ[t]he United\r\n  States Supreme Court has yet to consider whether the exclusionary rule applies\r\n  if a constitutional violation stems from erroneous information provided to\r\n  police by the officers or employees of a probation department.â€Â  People v. Ferguson, 109 Cal. App. 4th 367, 373 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003).Â  This appears to be a novel\r\n  issue for South Carolina as well.Â  Having determined that section 24-21-290\r\ndoes not apply in this case, we need not address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
