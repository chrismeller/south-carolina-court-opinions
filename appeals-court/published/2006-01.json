Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Retrice Lamont Funderburk appeals following a conviction for trafficking in cocaine.Â  Specifically, Funderburk argues the trial court improperly admitted evidence.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 16, 2000, Officers David Robinson and John McIntyre were patrolling Interstate I-85 in Greenville County when they observed a vehicle traveling too closely to an eighteen-wheeler truck.Â  After activating his blue lights and stopping the vehicle, Robinson approached the passenger side of the car.Â  Arriving at the passenger window, he noticed a female in the driverâ€™s seat, a male in the passengerâ€™s seat, and smelled what he believed to be burnt marijuana.Â  \r\nAfter a brief conversation with the occupants, Robinson asked the driver, Debbie Lipscomb, to step out of the car so he could issue her a warning for following too close.Â  While Robinson was writing the warning, he asked Lipscomb about her travels and learned the car belonged to the passengerâ€™s mother.Â  As he was talking to Lipscomb, Robinson saw the passenger, Retrice Funderburk, make several hand gestures out of the window.Â  Robinson walked back to the vehicle and asked Funderburk if he needed anything.Â  Approaching the car, Robinson again smelled the odor of burnt marijuana.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRobinson briefly talked with Funderburk and then asked for consent to search the vehicle.Â  Funderburk initially agreed to â€œopen up thingsâ€ for Robinson, but was told, for safety reasons, â€œhe couldnâ€™t do that.â€Â  Robinson then asked Funderburk to exit the car and leave the keys on the seat.Â  After Funderburk exited the vehicle, Robinson again asked for consent to search.Â  Funderburk responded by pointing toward the vehicle and saying â€œgo ahead.â€Â  Robinson conducted a brief visual search of the interior and then proceeded to the rear of the vehicle.Â  Robinson opened the trunk and searched through its contents. Â Soon thereafter, Funderburk questioned why the search was necessary.Â  Robinson then asked, once again, if he could search and Funderburk responded, â€œyes, you can.â€Â  After searching a few bags, Robinson put his hand on a black bag and felt two hard brick-shaped items that, from experience, he identified as either cocaine or marijuana.Â  Funderburk claimed ownership of the bag and then asked Robinson to stop the search.Â  Robinson stopped the search and instructed McIntyre to arrest Funderburk.Â  A struggle ensued, but Funderburk was eventually apprehended.Â  A more thorough search of the bag yielded 3.27 pounds of cocaine.Â  After Funderburk was restrained, Robinson found two blunts, or cigars filled with marijuana, in the vehicle.Â Â  \r\nA Greenville County grand jury indicted Funderburk for trafficking in cocaine and resisting arrest.Â  At trial, Funderburk moved to suppress the cocaine, arguing the search exceeded the scope of consent and the officers lacked probable cause to search the trunk.Â  Over his objection, the court allowed evidence and testimony regarding the cocaine.Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition, Funderburk objected to testimony which referred to the â€œbluntsâ€ as marijuana.Â  Funderburk argued that the substance was not tested, but the trial court allowed the testimony, ruling that Robinson may â€œtestify as to what his state of mind was.â€Â  Funderburk also objected to the introduction of the blunts into evidence, again arguing the State never definitively determined the substance to be marijuana and that introduction of the evidence was prejudicial.Â  Again, the court allowed the evidence over objection.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the close of trial, the jury found Funderburk guilty of trafficking in cocaine.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The appellate court â€œis bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.â€Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  The appellate court â€œdoes not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\nâ€œThe admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (citations omitted).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000) (quoting Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nScope of Consent \r\nFunderburk argues the trial court erred in denying counselâ€™s motion to suppress the cocaine found in the trunk because the officerâ€™s search exceeded the scope of consent.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œUnder our state constitution, suspects are free to limit the scope of the searches to which they consent.â€Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 648, 541 S.E.2d 837, 843 (2001).Â  â€œWhen relying on the consent of a suspect, a police officerâ€™s search must not exceed the scope of the consent granted or the search becomes unreasonable.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe scope of the consent is measured by a test of â€˜objectiveâ€™ reasonableness--what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?â€Â  State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 585-86, 575 S.E.2d 852, 856 (Ct. App. 2003) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nWe hold the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress because evidence exists to support the finding that Funderburkâ€™s consent included a search of the trunk.Â  First, the record indicates Funderburk imposed no limits on the scope of his consent to a search. Funderburk consented to the search of the vehicle three times: (1) before he exited the vehicle he agreed to â€œopen things upâ€; (2) as he walked away from the vehicle he pointed at the car and stated â€œgo aheadâ€; and (3) when Robinson asked about searching the trunk, Funderburk told him â€œyes, you can.â€ \r\nSecond, Funderburk failed to object to Robinsonâ€™s search.Â  â€œ[A] suspectâ€™s failure to object (or withdraw his consent) when an officer exceeds limits allegedly set by the suspect is a strong indicator that the search was within the proper bounds of the consent search.â€Â  United States v. Jones, 356 F.3d 529, 534 (4th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).Â  Here, Funderburk failed to withdraw his consent when Robinson searched through the vehicleâ€™s trunk. Therefore, the record demonstrates the scope of consent was not exceeded. Because Funderburk gave a general consent to a search of the vehicle and failed to object to Robinsonâ€™s search, we find the trial courtâ€™s ruling was supported by the evidence, and, therefore, we find no error.Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEvidence/Testimony Regarding Marijuana \r\nFunderburk argues on appeal, that the trial court erred in allowing the testimony and evidence regarding marijuana found during the search because it constituted improper propensity evidence pursuant to State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  We disagree. \r\nAt trial, Funderburk objected to the admission of the marijuana evidence based on an improper foundation.Â  Specifically, he argued the substance was never tested and/or analyzed and because of this, the substanceâ€™s admission, or testimony regarding it, would be improper.Â  At no time did Funderburk raise an objection based on Lyle.Â  Because Funderburkâ€™s arguments concerning propensity evidence were not presented to the trial court, we find they are not preserved for our review.Â Â  See, e.g., Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 102, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€). \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.

Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â \r\n        â€œWhen determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Id. at 494-495, 567 S.E.2d at 860.Â  â€œIf triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.â€Â \r\n        Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n        LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n              Underwood argues the trial court erred by granting Webbâ€™s motion for summary judgment because Taylor owed a duty of care to Underwood as a matter of law.Â  We disagree.\r\n                â€œTo prevail on a theory of negligence, the plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) that defendant owed a plaintiff a duty of care; (2) that by some act or omission, defendant breached that duty; and (3) that as a proximate result of the breach, the plaintiff suffered damage.â€Â  Staples v. Duell, 329 S.C. 503, 506, 494 S.E.2d 639, 641 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œThe court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.Â  If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â \r\n                Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 39, 533 S.E.2d 312, 316 (2000).\r\n                In South Carolina, urban landowners have a duty of reasonable care to inspect trees on their property and to make certain they are safe.Â  Staples, 329 S.C. at 508, 494 S.E.2d at 641-42 (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, Â§ 57 at 391 (5th ed. 1984)); Israel v. Carolina Bar-B-Que, Inc., 292 S.C. 282, 288, 356 S.E.2d 123, 127 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Also, landowners have a duty of reasonable care to make certain their trees are safe for travelers of streets adjoining their land.Â  Staples, 329 S.C. at 508, 494 S.E.2d at 642.Â  In Israel v. Carolina Bar-B-Que, 292 S.C. 282, 288-90, 356 S.E.2d 123, 127-28 (Ct. App. 1987), we held that a landowner has a duty to protect others from â€œdefective or unsound trees on his premisesâ€ and found the landowner was liable for the damage caused by the fallen tree limb because there was evidence that the owner either saw or could have seen upon reasonable inspection that the tree that caused the damage was partially decayed. \r\n                In this case, Taylorâ€™s tree was not unsafe or defective.Â  The tree limb did not fall and injure Coponen.Â  The only effect the tree limb had was that it partially obscured the stop sign, which Coponen testified that she was not looking for because she thought that she was driving on another street, which does not have stop signs.Â  Therefore, the rule set forth in Israel does not apply to the facts in this case.[2]Â  \r\n                Underwood also claims that because Taylor periodically trimmed the tree on his property, he undertook the duty to keep his tree from blocking the stop sign.Â  However, the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides:\r\n\r\n                One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the otherâ€™s person or things, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) the harm is suffered because of the otherâ€™s reliance upon the undertaking.Â  \r\n\r\n                Staples, 329 S.C. at 510, 494 S.E.2d at 643 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 323(a) (1965)). Â While Taylor did trim the tree occasionally for the purpose of clearing the stop sign and his failure to trim the tree might have increased the risk that the sign would be obstructed, neither Underwood nor Coponen knew that Taylor trimmed the tree, and thus they did not rely on his doing so.Â  Therefore, Taylorâ€™s occasional trimming of his tree did not create a duty for which he can be held liable.[3]Â  Additionally, even if Taylor had assumed a duty to trim the trees, he could have abandoned the duty at any time so long as his actions did not increase any risk that might have existed.Â  See Id. at 506, 494 S.E.2d at 641 (affirming the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the defendantâ€™s policy of searching for dead trees did not create a duty because he could have abandoned the policy at any time as long as doing so would not increase the risk of harm). \r\n                AFFIRMED.\r\n                GOOLSBY, and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n            \r\n            [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n            [2] In making their decision, the Israel court adopted Illinoisâ€™ ruling in Mahurin v. Lockhart, 390 N.E.2d 523 (Ill. 1979).Â  Therefore, it is worth noting that subsequent to publishing the Mahurin decision, Illinois issued several opinions on visual obstructions.Â  In Nichols v. Sitko, 510 N.E.2d 971, 974 (App. Ct. Ill. 1987), the court refused to extend the Mahurin rule, which involved an injury caused by a fallen dead branch, to an alleged visual obstruction from overgrown weeds.Â  The court reasoned that the alleged obstruction was â€œno different from obstructions which are caused by houses and buildings encountered routinely in daily life.â€Â  Id.Â  Also, in Adame v. Munoz, 678 N.E.2d 26, 29 (App. Ct. Ill. 1997), the court held that there is no duty â€œon the part of landowners to maintain their property in such a way that it does not obstruct the view of travelers on an adjacent highway, and this refusal to find such a duty applies even where the obstruction is an artificial condition.â€\r\n            [3]  We further note that not imposing a duty on Taylor promotes good public policy.Â  If we extended the duty to require private landowners to ensure that their trees do not hinder traffic control devises, we would be discouraging private landowners from voluntarily maintaining vegetation on their property which adjoins a public roadway or highway in an effort to shield themselves from unwarranted liability.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4068","title":"McDill v.

McDill filed this action on behalf of herself and her minor son, Garrett,[1] alleging Garrett suffered severe injuries in an automobile collision caused by Christopher Lawhon, a minor over the age of fourteen.Â  In her lawsuit McDill asserted claims against Christopher as well as his father, Dr. Mark Lawhon; his grandfather, James M. Lawhon; and the grandfatherâ€™s business, Markâ€™s Auto Sales, Inc.Â  McDill appeals from a jury verdict in favor of the defendants, arguing the trial court abused its discretion in failing to qualify a trooper as an expert in accident reconstruction and to allow his opinion testimony regarding the cause of the accident.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nShortly after 6:00 p.m. on July 23, 2001, Garrett McDill, then 15, was seriously injured while driving a 1992 Honda Accord that collided with a 1997 Camaro driven by Christopher Lawhon, also 15.Â  The accident occurred as the two cars traveled in the same direction in adjacent lanes of West Palmetto Street, a four-lane road in Florence.Â  \r\nJust before the accident, Christopher had recognized Garrett and madeÂ  a U-turn and then accelerated to catch up with him.Â  Garrett likewise recognized Christopher and several passengers in his car.Â  As they traveled next to each other on the four-lane road, Garrett was on the left and Christopher was on the right.Â  It had been raining most of the day and water had collected in the right-hand lane.Â  According to Garrett and one of his passengers, Christopher hit a puddle and then struck Garrettâ€™s car, causing it to slide sideways and then wrap around a utility pole.Â  In contrast, Christopher denied causing the accident, asserting Garrett was the one who apparently hit a puddle and then struck his vehicle.Â  \r\nGerri McDill brought this action on behalf of herself and Garrett against Christopher, his father, his grandfather, and his grandfatherâ€™s car dealership, Markâ€™s Auto Sales, Inc., which held title to the Camaro Christopher was driving at the time of the accident.Â  A jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.[2]Â  The trial court thereafter denied McDillâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, McDill argues the trial court committed reversible error in failing to qualify Trooper Bernard Williams of the South Carolina Highway Patrol as an expert in accident reconstruction and in excluding his opinion testimony that Christopher caused the automobile accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the start of the trial, McDill asked that Trooper Williamsâ€™s opinion regarding the cause of the accident be admitted as expert testimony.Â  The testimony was from Trooper Williamsâ€™s deposition â€“ he was not present at trial.Â  The defendants objected, arguing Trooper Williams was never listed as an expert witness in the area of accident reconstruction and he had never been qualified as such; therefore, although factual testimony as to his investigation was allowable, any testimony specifically regarding his opinion as to causation should be excluded.Â Â Â  \r\nIn his deposition, Trooper Williams testified that he was called to the scene of the accident and while there he spoke to Christopher, whom he identified as the driver of one of the vehicles in the accident.Â  Trooper Williams stated Christopher told him that he had hit a puddle of water on the roadway and that it caused him to hydroplane and slide into the left lane where Garrett was traveling.Â  Trooper Williams additionally stated that after his visit to the scene, based on his experience, it was his opinion that Christopher most probably caused the accident by striking a puddle and then hydroplaning into the left lane where Garrett was traveling.Â  \r\nAfter reviewing the deposition testimony, the trial court sustained the defendantsâ€™ objection, ruling McDill had not established a sufficient basis to qualify Trooper Williams as an expert and to permit him to give an opinion.Â  The court stated, however, that Trooper Williamsâ€™s testimony regarding adverse statements allegedly made to him by Christopher at the scene, i.e., that he was traveling in the right lane, hit water, and then hydroplaned, striking the rear of Garrettâ€™s vehicle, would be admissible as fact evidence for which it was not necessary that Trooper Williams be qualified as an expert or give expert opinion testimony.Â  During the trial, portions of Trooper Williamsâ€™s recorded deposition were subsequently played for the jury.Â  Christopher denied at trial ever having made the alleged statements to Trooper Williams.Â  \r\nAfter the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, McDill filed a motion for a new trial alleging, among other things, that the trial court erred in excluding the opinion testimony of Trooper Williams as to the cause of the automobile accident.Â  The trial court denied McDillâ€™s motion, finding it had properly excluded any opinion testimony from Trooper Williams because â€œneither Trooper Williamsâ€™[s] training nor testimony supported a ruling that he qualified as an expert in accident reconstructionâ€ and â€œ[b]y Trooper Williamsâ€™[s] own admission, he was not qualified to testify regarding accident reconstruction.â€Â  \r\nâ€œTo qualify as an expert, a person must have acquired by study or practical experience a special knowledge of a subject matter about which the juryâ€™s good judgment and average knowledge is inadequate.â€Â  Manning v.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp.,&nbsp;307 S.C. 161, 163, 414 S.E.2d 138, 139&nbsp;(1992).\r\nâ€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg,&nbsp;363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509&nbsp;(2005).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair.â€Â  Id.\r\nTo the extent McDill contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to qualify Trooper Williams as an expert in accident reconstruction, we find no error in this regard.Â  Aside from the fact that Trooper Williams was, admittedly, never listed as an expert witness by McDill,[3] there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s concerns as to his qualifications as an expert in accident reconstruction.Â  It was undisputed that Trooper Williams had experience in investigating accidents as a highway patrolman and that he did take a six-week accident reconstruction course in 1995 or 1996, as well as a few updating courses, but he was not a member of the Highway Patrolâ€™s official accident reconstruction team.Â  We note that when Trooper Williams was asked how he determined the approximate speeds of the two drivers in this accident, he stated he based it on what the drivers told him, as he did not have any evidence to the contrary.Â  Thus, he did not use any particular reconstructive techniques in making this determination.Â  He also apparently was allowed to give his opinion in a federal court proceeding, but that was because none of the attorneys objected to his testimony.Â  Thus, the court was not specifically asked to make a determination regarding his qualifications.[4]Â Â Â  \r\nJust as a trial court has broad discretion in qualifying a witness as an expert, which this court may not overturn on appeal, a trial court also has broad discretion in deciding not to qualify a witness as an expert.Â  As noted by Lawhon in his brief, if investigating an accident qualified an officer as an expert in accident causation, then every highway patrolman would qualify as an expert.Â  At most, the testimony presented by McDill established that Trooper Williams had investigated automobile accidents and possibly gave an opinion in a federal court proceeding regarding accident investigation.Â  Upon reviewing the record, we hold McDill has not clearly demonstrated the trial court abused its discretion in failing to qualify Trooper Williams as an expert in accident reconstruction.\r\nIn any event, even assuming it was error to fail to qualify Trooper Williams as an expert, McDill has not established prejudice warranting reversal.Â  See Owners Ins. Co. v. Clayton, 364 S.C. 555, 563, 614 S.E.2d 611, 615 (2005) (â€œError without prejudice does not warrant reversal.â€); Fields,&nbsp;363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509&nbsp;(â€œTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.â€). \r\nAs noted above, Trooper Williams was listed as a fact witness and the trial court allowed portions of his deposition testimony, with his opinion redacted, to be presented to the jury.Â  The jury was given Trooper Williamsâ€™s testimony that Christopher allegedly told him at the scene of the accident that he had hit a puddle, hydroplaned, and then moved over into the left lane, striking Garrettâ€™s vehicle.Â  This information is basically the same as the trooperâ€™s opinion that Christopher had hit a puddle and then hydroplaned into Garrettâ€™s vehicle.Â  It was up to the jury, as the finder of fact, to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to resolve any conflicts in their testimony.Â  See, e.g., Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc.,&nbsp;355 S.C. 316, 320, 585 S.E.2d 272, 274&nbsp;(2003) (holding it is up to a jury to decide credibility issues and to resolve any conflicts in the testimony or the evidence); Getsinger v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter III; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Frank Robert Patterson appeals his conviction for murder.Â  He argues the trial court erred (1) in admitting a witnessâ€™s statement to police; (2) by requiring Pattersonâ€™s presence during the videotaping of a witnessâ€™s testimony; and (3) by refusing to charge the jury on proximate cause.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPatterson was accused of murdering his girlfriend, Sharon Clark, by beating her to death.Â  Clark and her friend, Mary Richardson, walked to Pattersonâ€™s home where the three of them drank for several hours.Â  Later that night, Clark and Richardson decided to leave despite Pattersonâ€™s insistence Clark should stay.Â  As Richardson and Clark walked away, Patterson began striking Clark repeatedly with a blunt instrument.Â  \r\nRichardson screamed at Patterson to stop hitting Clark.Â  She ran to a neighborâ€™s house for assistance.Â  When Richardson returned to the scene, she saw Clark lying on the ground motionless.Â  Richardson ran down the street and flagged down a police car in the neighborhood.Â  Richardson led the officer to Clarkâ€™s location.Â  Patterson, with his clothes bloody, returned to the scene while the officer was there.Â  He admitted he had beaten Clark and was arrested.\r\nClark was taken to Richland Memorial Hospital where she was placed on a respirator and immediately rushed into the first of her two surgeries.Â  Clarkâ€™s skull was cracked in multiple places, and she had skull fragments in her brain.Â  She lost a significant amount of blood due to the severity of her head injury.Â  Clarkâ€™s prognosis was poor; she was taken off life support nine days later.Â  Her feeding tube was removed on March 25, and she died on March 27.Â  \r\nThe grand jury indicted Patterson for murder.Â  Due to medical reasons, Richardsonâ€™s testimony was videotaped. Â At the hearing, Patterson requested that he be allowed to waive his presence.Â  The trial court refused his request.Â  At trial, the jury found Patterson guilty of murder, and the trial court sentenced Patterson to life without parole. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 613 S.E.2d 381 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThe appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€Â  State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 15, 610 S.E.2d 823, 827 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003)); see also State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIn criminal cases, the court of appeals sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.â€).Â  This Court should examine the record to determine whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â Â  \r\nOn review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 613 S.E.2d 381.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant. See State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); see also State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995) (holding error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Rule 106, SCRE\r\nPatterson claims the trial court erred in admitting Richardsonâ€™s entire statement to police on redirect examination.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe State and defense counsel agreed to take Richardsonâ€™s testimony by video before trial.Â  Richardson testified that while she was talking to police on the night of Clarkâ€™s murder, Patterson returned to the scene, walked up to Clark, pointed to her and said, â€œYou see that right there? I did that.â€Â  On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited from Richardson that she believed the accuracy of her account of the murder to police was very important.Â  Richardson indicated she carefully read her statement to police before she affixed her signature.Â  Defense counsel then handed Richardson her statement and asked if Pattersonâ€™s admission was included in the statement.Â  Richardson conceded her statement to police did not include Pattersonâ€™s admission.Â  On redirect examination, the State argued defense counsel had, by cross-examining Richardson on her statement, opened the door to admit Richardsonâ€™s entire statement to police.Â  Despite objections from defense counsel that Richardson had merely been asked about an omission in the report, the trial court allowed Richardson to publish the statement in its entirety.Â  \r\nSignificantly, Richardsonâ€™s testimony on redirect examination was not played for the jury.Â  At trial, the defense stated:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Ms.\r\n          Pringle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Your Honor, Iâ€™ll go ahead and put on the record with respect to the next witness who is a Mary Richardson,\r\n          we have stipulated with the Solicitorâ€™s Office previously that Ms. Richardsonâ€™s testimony may be admitted by videotape, previously taped testimony 2002.Â  Your Honor, we of course obviously have no problem with the admission of the videotape in lieu of her testimony even though it is our understanding that she may be available to testify; with one caveat, Your Honor, that\r\n          we have agreed to cut the tape off at the end of cross-examination.Â \r\n          Mr. Cathcart indicates that he is going to just walk right up there and turn it off as soon as the end of cross.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Mr. Cathcart:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         I believe the area she is talking about is the redirect by the State.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  The record indicates that the videotape was played for the jury.Â  No objection was made at the conclusion of the taped testimony.Â  \r\nInitially, we note the issue of whether Richardsonâ€™s statement to police was properly admitted into evidence is not properly before this Court.Â  Pursuant to the partiesâ€™ stipulation, the jury never heard Richardson publish her statement.Â  Although counsel timely objected to publication of the statement at the time Richardsonâ€™s testimony was being taped, at trial, the videotape was played without objection by the defense. Objecting to admission of a statement during pretrial video testimony does not preserve an issue for review.Â  Cf. State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 250, 609 S.E.2d 572, 587 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 647, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001); State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002)).Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, a contemporaneous objection must be made when the evidence is offered. See State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 193 n. 3, 498 S.E.2d 642, 644 n. 3 (1998) (citing State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 42, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996) (â€œUnless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved for review.â€)); State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (â€œ[A]ppellant made no contemporaneous objection at trial and did not raise this issue at any point during trial. Consequently, this issue is not preserved for review.â€); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993). \r\nAdverting to the merits, we find the trial court properly ruled Richardsonâ€™s statement to police was admissible.Â  Rule 106, SCRE provides:\r\n\r\nWhen a writing, or recorded statement, or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it. \r\n\r\nRule 106 was promulgated by Order of the Supreme Court and became effective September 3, 1995.Â  See Editorâ€™s Note, Rule 106, SCRE.Â  The Rule restates the common law rule of completeness with one significant change.Â  Prior to the enactment of Rule 106, when part of a document, writing, or conversation was introduced into evidence, the opposing party could introduce the remainder of the communication.Â  See Dukes v. Smoak, 181 S.C. 182, 186 S.E. 780 (1936).Â  However, whereas under common law the opposing party was required to wait until cross-examination to complete the communication, under Rule 106, the party can now require introduction of the remainder of the statement contemporaneous with the original proffer.Â  See Rule 106, SCRE.Â  \r\nAs the South Carolina Supreme Court explained in State v. Taylor, â€œThe text of Rule 106, SCRE, is substantially similar to Rule 106 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.Â  Rule 106, Fed.R.Evid., is based on the rule of completeness and seeks to avoid the unfairness inherent in the misleading impression created by taking matters out of context.â€Â  333 S.C. 159, 170, 508 S.E.2d 870, 876 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Rainey v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 784 F.2d 1523, 1529 (11th Cir. 1986)).Â  The rule applies to oral communications as well as written statements.Â  State v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 379, 605 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2004); State v. Jackson, 265 S.C. 278, 284, 217 S.E.2d 794, 797 (1975).Â  \r\nIn Cabrera-Pena, the State elected to use a witness to elicit portions of the defendantâ€™s conversation.Â  361 S.C. at 380, 605 S.E.2d at 526.Â  Our supreme court found the rule of completeness required the defendant to be permitted to inquire into the full substance of the conversation.Â  Id.Â  Similarly, defense counsel, by asking Richardson whether her statement to police included Pattersonâ€™s admission, opened the door for the State to inquire into the full substance of her statement.Â  \r\nPatterson argues that because the inquiry referred to an alleged omission by Richardson as opposed to an affirmative declaration in the statement, Rule 106 does not apply.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nAfter eliciting testimony from Richardson regarding how careful she was in giving police a correct depiction of the events that led to Clarkâ€™s murder, defense counsel in essence insinuated Richardsonâ€™s statement to police was incomplete.Â  The defense put Richardsonâ€™s statement to police at issue, and fundamental fairness required the entire statement be admitted into evidence.Â  Patterson would have us construe Rule 106 in such a way that inquiries that probed at alleged omissions from a statement would not open the door to the admission of the statement. The purpose behind Rule 106 would be frustrated if the ruleâ€™s application in a given case depended upon whether an alleged oral assertion was or was not in a written statement. We find the rule of completeness applies to insinuations, innuendos, and omissions.Â  Thus, the trial judge properly admitted Richardsonâ€™s statement. \r\nFinally, even if the trial judge had erred in admitting the entire statement, Patterson has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice because the jury never heard the statement.Â  An error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal. See State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472-73, 613 S.E.2d 381, 384 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the defendant.â€) (citations omitted); Rule 103, SCRE (â€œError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected[.]â€).Â  The jury never heard the disputed portion of the videotape, and therefore, we cannot discern any prejudice to Patterson.Â  State v. Gathers, 295 S.C. 476, 482, 369 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1988), affâ€™d, 490 U.S. 805 (1989).\r\nII.Â  Presence During Videotaping of Witness Testimony\r\nPatterson argues the trial court erred by requiring his presence during the videotaping of Richardsonâ€™s testimony.Â  Patterson maintains he was severely prejudiced by Richardsonâ€™s claim that he was smiling during the commission of the murder.Â  We disagree.\r\nPatterson made no objection after Richardsonâ€™s video testimony was played for the jury, and, therefore, this issue is not preserved for review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, a contemporaneous objection must be made when the evidence is offered. See State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 193 n. 3, 498 S.E.2d 642, 644 n. 3 (1998) (citing State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 42, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996) (â€œ[U]nless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling is procured, the issue is not preserved for review.â€)); State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (â€œ[A]ppellant made no contemporaneous objection at trial and did not raise this issue at any point during trial. Consequently, this issue is not preserved for review.â€); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993). \r\nEven if the issue were properly preserved, we find the trial court did not err by requiring Pattersonâ€™s presence during the videotaping of Richardsonâ€™s testimony.Â  Pattersonâ€™s reliance on Rule 16, SCRCrimP is misplaced.\r\nRule 16, SCRCrimP provides:\r\n\r\nExcept in cases wherein capital punishment is a permissible sentence, a person indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried in his absence upon a finding by the court that such person has received notice of his right to be present and that a warning was given that the trial would proceed in his absence upon a failure to attend court.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nApodictically, a criminal defendant has a constitutional right guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to be present at trial.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. VI; Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 338 (1970) (â€œOne of the most basic of the rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause is the accusedâ€™s right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his trial.â€).Â  While Rule 16 permits a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to be present, such a waiver is permitted only in limited circumstances.Â  â€œA trial judge must determine a defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial in order to try the case in abstentia.â€Â  State v. Truesdale, 345 S.C. 542, 549, n. 5, 548 S.E.2d 896, 899, n. 5 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing State v. Rich, 292 S.C. 75, 76, 354 S.E.2d 909, 909 (1987); State v. Jackson, 288 S.C. 94, 95, 341 S.E.2d 375, 375 (1986); State v. Castineira, 341 S.C. 619, 622, 535 S.E.2d 449, 451 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  Additionally, the trial judge must make findings of fact that the defendant (1) received notice of the right to be present and (2) was warned the trial would proceed in his absence.Â  Jackson, 288 S.C. at 95, 341 S.E.2d at 375; Castineira, 341 S.C. at 622, 535 S.E.2d at 451.Â Â  \r\nThe right to be present at trial is not the right to be absent from trial.Â  A criminal defendant has no absolute right to be absent during trial proceedings.Â  In State v. Moore, the South Carolina Supreme Court held a defendant had no constitutional right to be absent from trial to prevent in-court identification.Â  308 S.C. 349, 351, 417 S.E.2d 869, 870 (1992).Â  The court found the State has a corresponding right to have the defendant present, elucidating: â€œâ€˜[I]t is the right of the prosecution to have [the defendant] in the view of the presiding judge and jury, and the counsel engaged in the trial.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting State v. Oâ€™Neal, 210 S.C. 305, 310-311, 42 S.E.2d 523, 525 (1947)).Â  In some circumstances, a defendant may be presumed to waive or forfeit the right to be present by misbehaving in the courtroom or by voluntarily remaining away from trial.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 625, 545 S.E.2d 805, 815 (2001); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 401, 360 S.E.2d 706, 711 (1987); Ellis v. State, 267 S.C. 257, 260-61, 227 S.E.2d 304, 305-06 (1976).Â  However, even though a criminal defendant may waive or forfeit his right to participate in the proceedings, â€œa defendant has no contrasting right to be absent from trial, even when his absence might assist the defense.â€Â  5 Wayne R. LaFave, Jerold H. Isreal, Nancy J. King, Criminal Procedure Â§ 24.2(b) (1999) (citations omitted).\r\nThe conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who will not be reversed in the absence of a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  â€œThe general rule in this State is that the conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the presiding judge and this Court will not interfere unless it clearly appears that the rights of the complaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way.â€Â  State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982) (citing State v. Sinclair, 275 S.C. 608, 274 S.E.2d 411 (1981)); Cf. State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295, 185 S.E.2d 607 (1971).Â  Pattersonâ€™s sole reason for desiring to be absent was his belief that he had a right to waive his presence.Â  Although a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present during court proceedings, the defendant has no absolute corresponding right to be absent.Â  The precedent extant edifies that a defendant may waive his right to be present in very limited scenarios.Â  The trial court did not err by refusing to allow Patterson to waive his presence at Richardsonâ€™s video hearing.Â  \r\nFurther, the alleged prejudicial statement was made during recross-examination and was not played for the jury.Â  Patterson could not have been prejudiced by testimony the jury never heard.Â  An error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.Â  See State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472-73, 613 S.E.2d 381, 384 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the defendant.â€) (citations omitted); Rule 103, SCRE (â€œError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected[.]â€).Â  Therefore, we find Patterson cannot show he was prejudiced.Â  See Gathers at 482, 369 S.E.2d at 143 (finding the duty is upon the defendant to prove prejudice.).Â  \r\nIII.Â  Jury Charge\r\nPatterson contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on proximate cause because there was evidence Clarkâ€™s death was due to her removal from life support.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001); State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 512 (2000); State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380 S.E.2d 834, 835 (1989); State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 40, 610 S.E.2d 823, 840 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000) (citing Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998)); see also State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 106, 610 S.E.2d 859, 865 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€) (citing Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 594 S.E.2d 462 (2004); State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002); State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 534 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  â€œIn reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Zeigler, 364 S.C. at 106, 610 S.E.2d at 865; accord State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  A jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  Adkins at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 463-64.Â  \r\nTo warrant reversal, a trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Reese, 359 S.C. 260, 273, 597 S.E.2d 169, 176 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œFailure to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial error where the instructions given afford the proper test for determining issues.â€ Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at 304.Â  â€œIf, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Zeigler, 364 S.C. at 106, 610 S.E.2d at 865 (citing State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991); State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 377 S.E.2d 570 (1989)).Â  A jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994).\r\nPatterson relies on State v. Matthews, 291 S.C. 339, 353 S.E.2d 444 (1986), and State v. Jenkins, 276 S.C. 209, 277 S.E.2d 147 (1981), for the proposition that, at the very minimum, he was entitled to a jury charge on proximate cause.Â  \r\nThe sixteen-year-old decedent in Matthews was shot in the head and pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital.Â  Her kidneys were harvested and donated for transplantation.Â  The appellant, Earl Matthews, argued the doctors prematurely declared the victim dead.Â  Matthews maintained the removal of her kidneys was a superseding cause of death which relieved him of liability for her murder.Â  291 S.C. at 346, 353 S.E.2d at 448.Â  The appellant conceded negligent medical treatment would not relieve him of liability; however, he argued declaring the victim brain dead and removing her kidneys did not constitute medical treatment.Â  Id. at 346, 353 S.E.2d at 448-49.Â  Matthews objected to the trial courtâ€™s jury charge on the applicable law of proximate cause regarding medical treatment because he believed harvesting organs for transplanting did not constitute medical care.Â  Our supreme court disagreed: â€œThe decision to declare a patient dead and to harvest organs for transplantation is clearly part of the care or duty that a doctor is responsible for providing.Â  We hold that the actions of the doctor did constitute medical care.â€Â  Matthews, 291 S.C. at 347, 353 S.E.2d at 449.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Jenkins, the victim had a rare, fatal reaction to the dye used in performing an arteriogramâ€”a common procedure administered to determine the extent of injuries to the major blood vessels.Â  276 S.C. at 210-11, 277 S.E.2d at 148. Â Evidence at trial showed the victim would have â€œsurvived absent the reaction, but that she would not have survived without medical treatment.â€Â  Id.Â  On appeal, Jenkins argued the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury on assault and battery with intent to kill and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  The court noted the appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the murder conviction, and therefore the trial court committed â€œno prejudicial error in refusing to submit to the jury the two degrees of assault and battery.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnlike the present case, both Jenkins and Matthews involved a medical procedure between the appellantâ€™s crime and the victimâ€™s death.Â  In Mathews, the appellant claimed the removal of the victimâ€™s kidneys was a superseding cause of death.Â  In Jenkins, despite appellantâ€™s contention that the victimâ€™s reaction to the dye was the cause of death, the South Carolina Supreme Court found no prejudice in the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge the jury as requested.Â  The court found â€œone who inflicts an injury on another is deemed by law to be guilty of homicide where the injury contributes mediately or immediately to the cause of the death of the other.â€Â  Jenkins, 276 S.C. at 211, 277 S.E.2d at 148 (emphasis added).Â  In neither case did appellant argue, as Patterson here argues, that removal from life support was the intervening cause of death.Â  \r\nBecause Clark showed signs of improvement, Patterson avers the doctors prematurely removed Clarkâ€™s ventilator and feeding tube.Â  The evidence shows Clark was operated on within thirty minutes of her arrival at the hospital due to the severity of her injuries.Â  Dr. Raymond Bynoe testified when Clark was brought to the hospital, â€œshe [had] lost at least a third of her blood volumeâ€ and â€œhad no spontaneous respiratory effort.â€Â  Additionally, Clarkâ€™s skull had an â€œeggshell type of appearance . . . which meant that it was cracked in multiple places[.]â€Â  Dr. Clay Nichols, a forensic pathologist corroborated the severity of Clarkâ€™s injuries, stating she sustained â€œsuch massive brain death and swelling that the dead brain tissue was . . . actually oozing out of the open skull fracture.â€ Â Clarkâ€™s cause of death, in Dr. Nicholsâ€™s opinion, was â€œ[m]assive blunt head trauma due to beating with a pipe.â€Â  The fact that she lived for a period of time after the beating had no effect as to the cause of her death and was in fact a â€œcompliment to the medical treatment she received at Richland Memorial.â€Â  Further, Dr. Nichols opined Clark would have â€œdied within minutes of . . . the injuryâ€ without medical attention.Â  \r\nâ€œCourts have confronted whether a victimâ€™s removal from life support renders a homicide verdict against the weight of the evidence and have rejected the contention that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction[.]â€Â  State v. Pelham, 824 A.2d 1082, 1091 (N.J. 2003) (citing State v. Fierro, 603 P.2d 74 (Ariz. 1979); Porter v. State, 823 S.W.2d 846 (Ark. 1992); People v. Saldana, 121 Cal. Rptr. 243 (Ct. App. 1975); State v.

App. 1992), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 829 (1993)).\r\nThe trial court refused Pattersonâ€™s jury charge on proximate causation, finding the mere fact Clark was withdrawn from life support was not the cause of death.Â  In State v. Pelham, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted â€œthe widely recognized principle that removal of life support, as a matter of law, may not constitute an independent intervening cause for purposes of lessening a criminal defendantâ€™s liability.â€Â  Pelham, 824 A.2d at 1092; see also State v. Velarde, 734 P.2d 449, 455-56 (Utah 1986) (â€œ[R]emoval of the respirator was not the cause of death . . . . the neurological surgeon who performed the surgery on [the victim] after the assault, testified that blunt-instrument injuries were the cause of death.â€); State v. Yates, 824 P.2d 519, 523 (Wis. Ct. App. 1992) (â€œWhen life support is removed, the cause of death is not the removal, but whatever agency generated the need for life support in the first instance.â€). Â Other courts have denied requests by defendants for jury instructions charging that a victimâ€™s removal from life support constitutes an independent intervening cause sufficient to relieve the defendant of criminal liability.Â  See, e.g., People v. Funes, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 758 (Ct. App. 1994); In re J.N., 406 A.2d 1275 (D.C. 1979); State v. Yates, 824 P.2d 519 (Wis. Ct. App. 1992) rehâ€™g denied, 833 P.2d 1390 (1992).Â Â  \r\nThe trial court has a duty to instruct the jury only on an issue that is supported by the evidence.Â  Knoten, 347 S.C. at 302, 555 S.E.2d at 394.Â  We find the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on proximate cause.Â  The Stateâ€™s evidence clearly established Clark died from severe traumatic blows to the head.Â  Under these facts, the removal of life support cannot be considered an independent intervening cause capable of breaking the chain of causation triggered by the defendantâ€™s wrongful actions.

Richter, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This case involves claims for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract.Â  The appellant, All American Homes of NC, LLC, a manufacturer of modular houses, contends the trial court erred in not requiring the respondents, Elwood and Frances Tomlinson, to elect their remedy after the jury returned a verdict in their favor on each claim.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nThe Tomlinsons decided to build a home on Lake Wateree and contacted defendant Kenneth B. Mixon, doing business as Pavillion Custom Homes.Â  Mixon held himself out as an All American authorized dealer.Â  An All American business card also identified him as such. Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Tomlinsons later visited the All American factory in North Carolina where they met with David Bridges, a regional sales manager and corporate representative of All American, and reviewed building plans.Â  Before the Tomlinsons left, they asked Bridges whether Mixon was an authorized dealer.Â  Bridges assured them he was.Â  Bridges also told the Tomlinsons All American had checked Mixon out and All American would â€œstand behind him.â€Â  The Tomlinsons then contracted to purchase the All American home through Mixon.Â  \r\nAfter Mixon started construction, All American terminated its relationship with Mixon and never delivered the home to the building site.Â  Calls by the Tomlinsons to All American went unanswered.Â  All the while, the Tomlinsons, in reliance upon the contract, incurred various costs and expenses.Â  They were also threatened with liens against their property.Â Â Â  \r\nWhen the Tomlinsons finally reached Bridges, he told them All American had dismissed Mixon as a builder and it would not build the home that the Tomlinsons had contracted to purchase.Â Â Â  \r\nThis suit followed with the Tomlinsons alleging, among other things, that they had entered into a contract with All American for the construction of the house in question.Â  \r\nThe trial judge advised in her charge to the jury that it was â€œto consider each [cause of action] as if the others donâ€™t exist,â€ that â€œthere is only one recovery for the wrong,â€ and that â€œat some particular point there will be a mechanism by which to make the appropriate award to the plaintiff[s].â€Â  She expressly instructed the jury that it was not to add any damages awarded on multiple claims â€œin order to provide recovery to the plaintiff[s].â€Â  \r\nIn a special interrogatory, the jury found Mixon to be All Americanâ€™s agent.Â  The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $46,149.00 on the Tomlinsonsâ€™ breach of contract claim and $73,416.67 on their negligent misrepresentation claim.[1]Â  The trial judge later denied a motion by All American to require the Tomlinsons to elect the remedy upon which they wanted to recover.Â  She then entered judgment on both claims, allowing the Tomlinsons to recover total damages in the amount of $119,565.67.Â  \r\nWe hold the trial judge erred in not requiring the election that All American sought.\r\nÂ In Save Charleston Foundation v. Murray,[2] this court said the following about the doctrine of election of remedies:\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of election of remedies involves a choice between two or more different and coexisting modes of procedure and relief afforded by law for the same injury.Â  Tzouvelekas v. Tzouvelekas, 206 S.C. 90, 33 S.E.2d 73 (1945); Walker v. McDonald, 136 S.C. 231, 134 S.E. 222 (1926); Boardman v. Lovett Enterprises, Inc., 283 S.C. 425, 323 S.E.2d 784 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Its purpose is to prevent double redress for a single wrong.Â  25 Am. Jur. 2d Election of Remedies Section 1 at 646 (1966).Â  Application of the doctrine should be confined to cases where double compensation of the plaintiff is threatened.Â  Id.Â  Section 3 at 650.Â  When an identical set of facts entitle the plaintiff to alternative remedies, he may plead and prove his entitlement to either or both; however, the plaintiff may not recover both.Â  Baeza v. Robert E. Lee Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, Inc., 279 S.C. 468, 309 S.E.2d 763 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  â€œThis rule rests on the principle that the plaintiff should have a full opportunity to prove his claim to some form of relief, but he should not receive a double recovery.â€Â  Id. at 473, 309 S.E.2d at 766.[3]  \r\n\r\nFor the doctrine of election of remedies to apply, therefore, two or more remedies must be available to the complaining party at the time of the election and these remedies must be inconsistent.[4]Â  An inconsistency exists where, if an election is not made, a party will receive a double recovery.[5]Â  \r\nHere, the Tomlinsons recovered damages on claims of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.Â  These recoveries rest on the same set of facts, viz., that All American represented its dealer Mixon to be its agent;[6] that the Tomlinsons contracted with All American through its dealer and agent Mixon to manufacture a modular house and have it delivered to and constructed upon the Tomlinsonsâ€™ property on Lake Wateree; that All American failed to perform when it refused to deliver the house to the building site and complete the construction started by its agent, notwithstanding All American represented it would stand behind him; and that the Tomlinsons suffered damages as a consequence.Â  \r\nTo avoid a double recovery, the Tomlinsons, therefore, should elect on remand which one of the two claims they wish to recover their damages upon.[7]\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.Â  ANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.Â  \r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  The holding of the majority misconstrues and misapplies the law extant in regard to the doctrine of election of remedies.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM the jury verdicts.\r\nThe jury rendered verdicts for Elwood Porter Tomlinson and Frances Goins Tomlinson (the Tomlinsons) against All American Homes of NC, LLC (All American) on a breach of contract claim in the amount of $46,146.00 and a negligent misrepresentation claim in the amount of $73,416.67.Â  All American contends the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to require an election of remedies.Â  I disagree.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Tomlinsons, who reside in Charlotte, North Carolina, planned to build their retirement home on a lot near Lake Wateree, South Carolina.Â  In early 2001, the Tomlinsons contacted Kenneth Mixon, who worked as a manufactured home dealer, about a Cape Cod style home.Â  Mixon told the Tomlinsons about All American Homes, a manufacturer of pre-built, modular homes which are sold to authorized builders/dealers, who in turn sell them to the end customer.Â  The houses are made of wood, in sections, delivered to the sites and placed on foundations.Â  The customer must purchase a home through a dealer.\r\nMixon suggested the Tomlinsons go to the companyâ€™s factory.Â  A meeting was scheduled.Â  The Tomlinsons met with David Bridges, the regional sales manager for All American.Â  Mixon promised to meet them there, but he did not attend due to car trouble. Â At the meeting, All American approved proposed changes for the home and gave the Tomlinsons assurances concerning Mixon.Â  All American assured the Tomlinsons that Mixon had been checked out, he was an All American dealer in good standing, and Bridges would â€œstand behind him.â€Â  Bridges does not recall any discussions regarding Mixon. Â However, the Tomlinsons declared that Bridgesâ€™ assurances concerning Mixon affected their decision to proceed with the transaction.\r\nThe Tomlinsons appeared to have entered into a contract with Mixon on or about March 9, 2001, even though the meeting did not occur until later and Mixon had not yet been approved as a dealer for All American.Â  The Tomlinsons issued a check made payable to Pavillion Homes in the amount of $10,000 dated March 9, 2001.Â  The Authorized Builder Application of Mixon is dated April 23, 2001.Â  Bridges believed the meeting occurred after May 18, 2001. \r\nThe assurances the Tomlinsons received at the meeting with All American only affected their going forward with building and not the entering into the contract itself.Â  Although unsigned by Mixon, the written agreement lists a pre-tax purchase price of $176,694.Â  The house model listed on the contract between the Tomlinsons and Mixon was not a Cape Cod style house, but rather a â€œSalt Box RSO.â€Â  This model was sold by Mixonâ€™s former company, Virginia Homes, but not by All American. \r\nThe Tomlinsons obtained construction financing and work began on their house.Â  On August 15, 2001, All American agreed to sell the house to Mixon for $109,700.97 and received a $1,000 deposit from Mixon.Â  When construction slowed, the Tomlinsons tried to reach Mixon repeatedly.Â  The Tomlinsons confronted Mixon at his house and were told that someone else would finish the house.Â  All American had not initiated construction on the house because Mixon had not returned the required confirmation package, which consisted of a builder-approved floor plan and order contract.\r\nOn September 18, 2001, All American terminated Mixon as an authorized builder/dealer.Â  The Tomlinsons were not informed of Mixonâ€™s proposed termination and continued with the building of their house.Â  Mr. Tomlinson stated that if All American Homes had informed him of Mixonâ€™s termination when it happened, he would have â€œimmediatelyâ€ stopped the work that was being done on the site and the damages would have been limited at that point to $12,000.Â  According to Mrs. Tomlinson, â€œa lot of expenseâ€ would have been saved.Â  Prior to learning that Mixon was no longer a dealer with All American, the Tomlinsons withdrew approximately $32,000 on the construction loan.Â  That loan was refinanced, and other costs â€“ storage, marina rental, utilities at the site â€“ also accrued, for damages of approximately $60,000.\r\nIn April 2002, the Tomlinsons filed a complaint against Mixon d/b/a Pavillion Custom Homes and All American Homes of North Carolina, LLC, alleging breach of contract, third party beneficiary contract rights, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, constructive trust, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  The Tomlinsons presented damages in excess of $130,000.\r\nFollowing a default by Mixon, the case was tried against All American before a jury.Â  Only three claims remained at the close of trial: breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  In response to a special interrogatory, the jury found Mixon was an agent of All American.Â  The jury returned verdicts in favor of the Tomlinsons on the breach of contract claim, awarding $46,146.00, and the negligent misrepresentation claim, awarding $73,416.67.Â  On June 18, 2003, the trial court ordered post-trial motions and plaintiffâ€™s election of remedies to be filed within ten days. Â The Tomlinsons objected to an election.Â  The trial court ruled no election was required.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The Doctrine of Election of Remedies\r\nAll American contends the trial court erred in denying its post-trial motion requesting an election of remedies.Â  I disagree.\r\nThe doctrine of election of remedies involves a choice between two or more different and coexisting modes of procedure and relief afforded by law for the same injury.

App. 2000) (noting that election of remedies involves a choice between different forms of redress afforded by law for the same injury or different forms of proceeding on the same cause of action).Â  Election of remedies is the act of choosing between different remedies allowed by law on the same set of facts.Â  Taylor, 324 S.C. at 218, 479 S.E.2d at 44-45; Harper v. Ethridge, 290 S.C. 112, 348 S.E.2d 374 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nThe basic purpose behind the election of remedies doctrine is the principle that there can be no double recovery for a single wrong.Â  Brown, 320 S.C. at 294, 465 S.E.2d at 95; Harbin v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas, 316 S.C. 423, 450 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Cowart, 337 S.C. at 364, 523 S.E.2d at 185 (purpose of doctrine of election of remedies is to prevent double redress for a single wrong).Â  Use of the doctrine is limited to cases in which a double recovery by the plaintiff is threatened.Â  Adams v. Grant, 292 S.C. 581, 358 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App. 1986); Save Charleston Found. v. Murray, 286 S.C. 170, 333 S.E.2d 60 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nWhen one set of facts entitles the plaintiff to alternative remedies, he may plead and prove his entitlement to either or both.Â  Save Charleston Found., 286 S.C. at 176, 333 S.E.2d at 64; Baeza v. Robert E. Lee Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, Inc., 279 S.C. 468, 309 S.E.2d 763 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  However, the plaintiff may not recover both.Â  Id. Â \r\nA defendant may raise the issue of election of remedies at any stage of the case.Â  Cowart, 337 S.C. at 364, 523 S.E.2d at 185.Â  Indeed, to carry out the doctrineâ€™s purpose, the trial judge should sua sponte require election if he lets both causes of action go to the jury.Â  Id.; Brown, 320 S.C. at 294, 465 S.E.2d at 95.Â  To hold otherwise would result in an impermissible double recovery.Â  Adamson v. Marianne Fabrics, Inc., 301 S.C. 204, 391 S.E.2d 249 (1990); Inman, 303 S.C. at 15, 397 S.E.2d at 777.\r\nElection of remedies is not applicable where there are two separate causes of action, each based on different facts.Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. at 218, 479 S.E.2d at 45; Jones, 318 S.C. at 175, 456 S.E.2d at 432; Robert Harmon and Bore, Inc. v. Jenkins, 282 S.C. 189, 318 S.E.2d 371 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  When applying the doctrine of election of remedies, courts examine the underlying facts in the causes of action and determine if different conduct supports distinct injuries.Â  See Taylor, 324 S.C. at 218, 479 S.E.2d at 45; Creach v. Sara Lee Corp., 331 S.C. 461, 502 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1998); Jones v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 171, 456 S.E.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nIn order to decide if the doctrine of election of remedies is applicable to the facts of the instant case, and because the application of the doctrine depends heavily on the specific facts of a case, I analyze prior precedent concerning election of remedies.\r\nIn Jones v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 171, 456 S.E.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1995), our court summarized the principles of election of remedies.Â  Jones brought an action against Winn-Dixie alleging slander, outrage, false imprisonment, and assault and battery after she had been forcibly detained at the store as a suspected shoplifter.Â  Id. at 174, 456 S.E.2d at 431.Â  The jury returned verdicts in the same amounts on the false imprisonment and assault and battery causes of action.Â  Id.Â  The trial court eliminated one of the awards under election of remedies, reasoning that the failure to do so would result in double recovery because Jones had essentially suffered one wrong.Â  Id.Â  In reversing that decision, this court explained:\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of election of remedies involves a choice between different forms of redress afforded by law for the same injury or different forms of proceeding on the same causes of action.Â  Stated another way, election of remedies is the act of choosing between different remedies allowed by law on the same set of facts.Â  Its purpose is to prevent double redress for a single wrong.Â  Where a party has asserted only one primary wrong, he is entitled to only one recovery.Â  However, the principle has no application where two separate causes of action, each based on different facts, exist.\r\n\r\nJones, 318 S.C. at 175, 456 S.E.2d at 432.Â  The court focused on the distinct elements of the differing causes of action in finding that â€œdistinctive injuries occurred at different times,â€ thus supporting each separate award against Winn-Dixie.Â  Id.\r\nOur Supreme Court, in Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996), cited Jones in concluding the trial court erred in forcing an election of remedies.Â  Taylor brought suit for medical malpractice, complaining about the manner in which Dr. Medenica had handled the treatment of Taylorâ€™s breast cancer.Â  As a result of Dr. Medenicaâ€™s actions, Taylor was ineligible for alternative forms of chemotherapy.Â  At the time of trial, it was uncontested that her condition was terminal.Â  Id. at 210, 479 S.E.2d at 40.Â  Taylor sought to recover under negligence and unfair trade practices.Â  Id.Â  The jury returned substantial awards on both causes of action.Â  Id. at 219, 479 S.E.2d at 45.Â  The court enunciated that an election of remedies was not proper.Â  The court observed that the negligence cause of action was based on the provision of â€œreckless medical care,â€ while the Unfair Trade Practices Act claim was premised on billing for useless and unnecessary tests.Â  The court recognized that, because different conduct supports the UTPA and negligence claims, no election was required.Â  Id.\r\nCreach v. Sara Lee Corporation, 331 S.C. 461, 502 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1998), is analogous to the case at hand.Â  Creach involved an action for negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability for injuries suffered when Creach bit into a biscuit that contained a hard substance that injured her tooth.Â  Id. at 463, 502 S.E.2d at 924.Â  The jury found for Creach on all three causes of action and returned a verdict of $60,000 against Sara Lee.Â  Id.Â  The defense argued the verdict represented triple recovery and moved that the verdict be reformed.Â  The court confirmed no election was required because only one recovery was sought and only one recovery was awarded.Â  Id.Â  The court of appeals expressed its imprimatur with the jury charge by the trial court.Â  The trial court instructed the jury: â€œCreach was not entitled to multiple redress for a single wrong.â€Â  Id. at 464, 502 S.E.2d at 924.\r\nThe first inquiry in an election of remedies case is whether the causes of action involved different elements of proof, speak to facts occurring at different points in time, and are not simply two ways of describing a single wrong.Â  See Taylor, 324 S.C. at 218, 479 S.E.2d at 45; Creach, 331 S.C. at 464, 502 S.E.2d at 924; Jones, 318 S.C. at 175, 456 S.E.2d at 432.Â  Here, All American contends the Tomlinsons should elect between the remedies for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.Â  One cause of action, based in tort, addresses the circumstances and representations made prior to and after entering into the contract.Â  The other cause of action is in contract and applies to the failure to perform.\r\nII.Â  Breach of Contract\r\nThe first remedy sought concerns breach of contract.Â  A binding, valid contract must exist for there to be a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  See Tidewater Supply Co. v. Industrial Elec. Co., 253 S.C. 483, 171 S.E.2d 607 (1969); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIn order for a contract to be valid and enforceable, the parties must have a meeting of the minds as to all essential and material terms of the agreement.Â  Davis v. Greenwood Sch. Dist. 50, __S.C.__, 620 S.E.2d 65 (2005); Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 382 S.E.2d 891 (1989); see also Edens v. Laurel Hill, Inc., 271 S.C. 360, 364, 247 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1978) (â€œIt is well settled in South Carolina that in order for there to be a binding contract between parties, there must be a mutual manifestation of assent to the terms.â€).Â  The â€œmeeting of mindsâ€ required to make a contract is not based on secret purpose or intention on the part of one of the parties, stored away in his mind and not brought to the attention of the other party, but must be based on purpose and intention which has been made known or which, from all the circumstances, should be known.Â  Player, 299 S.C. at 105, 382 S.E.2d at 894.Â  â€œA contract exists where there is an agreement between two or more persons upon sufficient consideration either to do or not to do a particular act.â€Â  Benya v. Gamble, 282 S.C. 624, 628, 321 S.E.2d 57, 60 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nA contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct.Â  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 516 S.E.2d 923 (1999); Gaskins v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of South Carolina, 271 S.C. 101, 245 S.E.2d 598 (1978); Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 661, 582 S.E.2d at 439.Â  These principles govern contract formation generally and specifically control the creation of a contract.Â  Hodge v. National Fidelity Ins. Co., 221 S.C. 33, 68 S.E.2d 636 (1952).\r\nThe necessary elements of a contract are offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003); Armstrong v. Collins, Op. No. 4028 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Oct. 3, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 38 at 41); see also Hughes v. Edwards, 265 S.C. 529, 220 S.E.2d 231 (1975) (stating for a contract to arise there must be an agreement between two or more parties and an offer, acceptance, and meeting of the minds of the parties involved).\r\nA contract may give a right to demand performance, but no cause of action arises until a party refuses or neglects to perform some duty required by the terms of the contract.Â  See Tillinghast v. Boston &amp; Port Royal Lumber Co., 39 S.C. 484, 18 S.E. 120 (1893), overruled on other grounds by Hendrix v. Hendrix, 296 S.C. 200, 371 S.E.2d 528 (1988).Â  Thus, a contract cannot give rise to a cause of action until there has been some breach of such contract.Â  Id.Â  A breach of contract is defined as a failure without legal excuse to perform any promise which forms the whole or part of a contract.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 188 (6th ed. 1990).Â  A party breaches a contract when he does not perform as he agreed to perform under the contract.Â  A partyâ€™s contractual duty is found in the obligation assumed by the party to the contract.Â  Sechrest v. Forest Furniture Co., 141 S.E.2d 292 (N.C. 1965).Â  A partyâ€™s failure to comply with the contractual duty constitutes the breach.Â  Id.Â  Nonperformance of a valid contract is a breach thereof.\r\nTo recover for a breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove:\r\n\r\n(1) a binding contract entered into by the parties;\r\n(2) a breach or unjustifiable failure to perform the contract; and\r\n(3) damage suffered by the plaintiff as a direct and proximate result of the breach.\r\n\r\nFuller v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 124 S.E.2d 602 (1962).Â  The general rule is that for a breach of contract the defendant is liable for whatever damages follow as a natural consequence and a proximate result of such breach.Â  Id.Â  Damages recoverable for breach of contract either must flow as a natural consequence of the breach or must have been reasonably within the partiesâ€™ contemplation at the time of the contract.Â  Manning v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 377 S.E.2d 335 (1989); Kline Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Superior Trucking Co., 261 S.C. 542, 201 S.E.2d 388 (1973).\r\nDamages in a breach of contract action are to place the nonbreaching party in the position he or she would have been had there been no breach and the contract was performed.Â  See Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Assocs., Inc., 296 S.C. 207, 371 S.E.2d 532 (1988) (explaining that purpose of award of damages for breach is to give compensation, that is, to put plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed); Minter v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 473 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating purpose of damages for breach of contract is to put plaintiff in as good a position as he or she would have been if contract had been performed).Â  Damages give the nonbreaching party the benefit of his bargain.Â  South Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 303 S.C. 74, 399 S.E.2d 8 (Ct. App. 1990), affâ€™d, 310 S.C. 232, 423 S.E.2d 114 (1992).Â  The proper measure of damages for breach of contract is the loss actually suffered by the contractee as the result of the breach.Â  South Carolina Fin. Corp. v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. 109, 113 S.E.2d 329 (1960).Â  In the normal case, the damage will consist of two distinct elements: (1) out-of-pocket costs actually incurred as a result of the contract; and (2) the gain above costs that would have been realized had the contract been performed.Â  Collins Entmâ€™t, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 611 S.E.2d 262 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nThe breach of contract action in the instant case pertains to All Americanâ€™s failure to construct a home at the Tomlinsonsâ€™ property.Â  As the jury responded to the special interrogatory finding Mixon was an agent of All American, it is reasonable to conclude the jury therefore found All American responsible for breach of the contract entered into between the Tomlinsons and Mixon.Â  The Tomlinsons sought and recovered actual damages suffered as a result of All Americanâ€™s failure to manufacture, deliver, and/or install the Cape Cod Home on the property as contractually agreed.\r\nIII.Â  Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nThe negligent misrepresentation cause of action dealt with the meeting that took place in North Carolina between the Tomlinsons and All American. South Carolina courts have recognized the common law tort of negligent misrepresentation.Â  See Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003); Gilliland v. Elmwood Prop., 301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990); Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 557 S.E.2d 676 (Ct. App. 2001); DeBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 536 S.E.2d 399 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Thus, one may bring an action sounding in tort for negligent misrepresentation.\r\nâ€œA duty to exercise reasonable care in giving information exists when the defendant has a pecuniary interest in the transaction.â€Â  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 474, 581 S.E.2d 496, 504 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Recovery of damages in a negligent misrepresentation action is based upon negligent conduct and predicated upon a negligently made false statement where a party suffers either injury or loss as a consequence of relying upon the misrepresentation.Â  Evans v. Rite Aid Corp., 324 S.C. 269, 478 S.E.2d 846 (1996); Gruber v. Santee Frozen Foods, Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 419 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1992); see also First Fed. Sav. Bank v. Knauss, 296 S.C. 136, 370 S.E.2d 906 (Ct. App. 1988) (recognizing that under appropriate facts, negligent representations inducing property purchase could be actionable); Pittman v. Galloway, 281 S.C. 70, 313 S.E.2d 632 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding negligent representation inducing the plaintiffâ€™s purchase of land is actionable).Â  A claim for negligent misrepresentation may be made when the misrepresented facts induced the plaintiff to enter a contract or business transaction.Â  Redwend, 354 S.C. at 474, 581 S.E.2d at 504.\r\nTo recover in a negligent misrepresentation action, a plaintiff must prove:\r\n\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff;\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the\r\nstatement;\r\n(3)Â Â Â Â  the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff;\r\n(4)Â Â Â Â  the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due\r\ncare;\r\n(5)Â Â Â Â  the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and\r\n(6)Â Â Â Â  the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as a direct and\r\nproximate result of his reliance upon the representation.\r\n\r\nSauner, 354 S.C. at 407, 581 S.E.2d at 166; Armstrong v. Collins, Op. No. 4028 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Oct. 3, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 38 at 41); Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 42, 557 S.E.2d 676, 680-81 (Ct. App. 2001); DeBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 266-67, 536 S.E.2d 399, 405 (Ct. App. 2000); AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 222, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  For purposes of proving negligent misrepresentation, evidence that a statement was made in the course of the defendantâ€™s business, profession, or employment is sufficient to prove the defendantâ€™s pecuniary interest in making the statement, even if the defendant received no consideration for it.Â  AMA Mgmt. Corp., 309 S.C. at 223, 420 S.E.2d at 874.\r\nThe negligent misrepresentation cause of action stems from the meeting in North Carolina where the Tomlinsons were told All American had investigated Mixon and All American would â€œstand behindâ€ him. The Tomlinsons sought and recovered actual damages suffered as a result of their reliance upon these representations given by All American regarding Mixonâ€™s dealership status.Â  The Tomlinsonsâ€™ reliance on those alleged misrepresentations was manifested in their decision to further deal with Mixon for the construction of their home and in continuing to do business with All American after Mixon failed to perform.Â  After analyzing the different elements of a breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, and the facts underlying the causes of action in the instant case, it is luculent that the two causes of action involved separate injuries occurring at different times.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe evidentiary record is the quintessential example of damages irrefutably pertaining to different causes of action, i.e., a separate and distinct breach of contract claim and a negligent misrepresentation cause of action.Â  The breach of contract damages eventuated from All Americanâ€™s failure to deliver the home as ordered.Â  The damages emanating from the negligent misrepresentation cause of action arose from the Tomlinsonsâ€™ continued reliance on All Americanâ€™s relationship with\r\nMixon.\r\nMr. Tomlinson testified if All American Homes had informed him of Mixonâ€™s termination when it happened, the work would have â€œimmediatelyâ€ stopped on the site and the damages would have been limited at that point to $12,000.Â  According to Mrs. Tomlinson, â€œa lot of expenseâ€ would have been saved.Â  Prior to learning that Mixon was no longer a dealer with All American, the Tomlinsons withdrew approximately $32,000 on the construction loan.Â  That loan was refinanced, and other costs â€“ storage, marina rental, utilities at the site â€“ accrued, for damages of approximately $60,000.\r\nFurthermore, All American knew or should have known the Tomlinsons were obtaining a construction loan and did not advise the Tomlinsons as to Mixonâ€™s status at All American.Â  As the preparation of the Tomlinson home site and foundation began, the Tomlinsons continued to incur expenses and were never informed that All American had terminated its relationship with Mixon and had no intention of delivering a home.Â  Mr. Tomlinson averred that after All American terminated Mixon as a dealer and failed to inform the Tomlinsons, Mixon continued to draw on the home loan and work continued on the house.Â  The Tomlinsons suffered damages in addition to the breach of contract damages as a result of this action.Â  The negligent misrepresentation in the instant case stemmed from the Tomlinsonsâ€™ continued reliance on All Americanâ€™s assurances even after Mixon had been dismissed, and in All Americanâ€™s failure to inform the Tomlinsons of Mixonâ€™s revocation as an All American dealer in order for the Tomlinsons to mitigate their damages.\r\nThe jury charges substantiated the conclusion that the causes of action involved different elements and created different damages.Â  In describing the damages flowing from the breach of contract claim, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\nActual damages are intended to compensate that person and put them in as nearly as possible in the position that they would have been in before the breach occurred.\r\nActual damages would be the actual losses and expenses which have been suffered by the plaintiff because the defendant breached the contract.Â  Damages give the non-breaching party the benefit of his bargain.\r\nIn a normal case, that would consist of two distinct elements.Â  One would be the out-of-pocket expenses and costs that have actually incurred as a result of the contract and the other would be the gain above cost that would have been realized had the contract been performed. \r\nThese damages must flow as a natural consequence of the breach or must have reasonably been within the contemplation of the minds of the parties at the time that the contract was made. \r\nIn identifying the damages resulting from the negligent misrepresentation claim, the judge asseverated:\r\nFinally, the plaintiff must prove that the plaintiff suffered a monetary loss as a direct and proximate result of the reliance on these statements.Â  What we mean by that is that it must have been reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff would rely on the statement and that he would be caused harm as a result of relying on that particular statement.\r\nNow, once you have determined whether or not the plaintiff has met those elements of the negligent misrepresentation then you would again consider the actual damages.Â  And again, actual damages are the actual losses and expenses that have been suffered by the plaintiff because of the actions of the defendant.Â  \r\n\r\nThe judge inculcated the jury to award ONLY damages resulting from the specific conduct concerning each cause of action on a separate and distinct basis.Â  As in Creach v. Sara Lee Corp., 331 S.C. 461, 502 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1998), the jury in the instant case was given clear instructions as to the differing theories of recovery.Â  There were no exceptions to the jury charge.\r\nThe trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that they were to consider each of the questions on the verdict form separately â€œas if the other claims did not exist.â€Â  Moreover, the trial court charged the jury that the law did not allow for multiple recoveries for the same wrong.Â  The judge commanded the jury to consider each cause of action separately.Â  All counsel approved the charge and complimented the trial court on the delivery of a comprehensive and comprehensible jury charge.\r\nThe jury returned verdicts on the breach of contract claim in the amount of $46,149 and on the negligent misrepresentation cause of action in the amount of $73,416.67.Â  The jury determined different damages and amounts of damages flowing from the separate injuries of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, bolstering the ruling that no election of remedies is required.Â  The verdicts of the jury are logically supported.Â  Attempting to determine the allocation of the differing elements of damage would be an egregious and offensive invasion of the province of the jury.\r\nThe actual damages ultimately presented and argued to the jury aggregated $131,985.21.Â  The combined verdict was $119,565.67.Â  All of the amounts were liquidated.Â  All American cannot argue that the amount awarded did not exceed the total actual amount presented.Â  The jury found, in considering the actions separately, that certain losses flowed from the negligent misrepresentation, while certain other losses were more properly attributable to the breach of contract.Â  Apodictically, the Tomlinsons did not receive double recovery.\r\nI VOTE to AFFIRM the jury verdicts.Â  No election is mandated in this case.\r\n\r\n[1] Although the juryâ€™s verdict for the breach of contract claim is $46,149.00 on the verdict form, slightly different amounts are contained in the record and in one of the briefs, but these discrepancies appear to be mere scrivenerâ€™s errors. \r\n[2]Â  286 S.C. 170, 333 S.E.2d 60 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n[3]Â  Id. at 175-76, 333 S.E.2d at 63-64.\r\n[4]Â  25 Am. Jur. 2d Election of Remedies Â§ 16, at 776 (1996).\r\n[5]Â  Id.

Covert argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence due to a defective search warrant, allowing improper closing arguments, and using an unusual verdict form.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS \r\n      Kevin Covert, Charles Henderson, and others were present in Covertâ€™s house in Greenville County when police searched it on September 26, 2002.Â  When the officers entered the house they found Henderson in the living room with a coffee grinder containing a white powder substance, small plastic bags of white powered substance, a cutting agent, sifting instruments, and an electronic scale, all in front of him on a coffee table.Â  A cell phone box on the couch next to him contained a large plastic bag of cocaine, weighing 441.50 grams.Â  Cocaine, weighing 22.89 grams, was found on the coffee table.Â  Two smaller quantities of cocaine, weighing 6.47 grams and 1.62 grams, were also recovered.Â  Police also found $1,950 on the floor in front of the couch.Â  Additionally, police found a pistol on a bookshelf.Â  Henderson was the only person in the living room.Â  Covert was found in a bedroom on the other side of the house.Â  A holster for a gun, a 9-mm. magazine, and several dozen rounds of ammunition were found in an adjacent bedroom that belonged to Henderson.\r\n        All the individuals in the house were arrested and charged with trafficking in cocaine.Â  However, Covert and Henderson were also charged with possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Donald Myers and Roger Harris, both charged with trafficking, pled guilty to simple possession and were to receive suspended sentences in exchange for testifying for the State.Â  Myers testified he purchased cocaine from Covert and Henderson at the house numerous times.Â  Myers stated his purchases usually amounted to between one hundred and two hundred dollars each for between one and three-quarters grams and three and one-half grams of cocaine.Â  Myers also testified he had seen both Covert and Henderson bagging cocaine.Â  On September 26, Myers was at the house to purchase cocaine from Covert.\r\n        Harris also testified he had purchased cocaine from Covert and Henderson at their house at least twice a week for the previous two years.Â  Harris stated Henderson sometimes delivered cocaine to his house.Â  Harris further testified that on the morning of September 26, Covert asked him to give him a ride to Atlanta.Â  Harris testified they drove to a bar in Atlanta where Covert met another individual.Â  Covert asked for Harrisâ€™s â€œelectronic door opener.â€Â  Covert returned about thirty minutes later and they drove back to Greenville.Â  Although the State attempted to establish that Harris drove Covert to Atlanta to obtain over 400 grams of cocaine, Harris did not see any cocaine during the trip. \r\n        After his arrest, Covert gave a statement to the police and admitted he purchased cocaine in Atlanta on September 26.Â  Covertâ€™s statement identifies his connection in Atlanta and details the activities of the trip.Â  Covert did not testify at trial.Â  On Hendersonâ€™s motion, Covertâ€™s statement was redacted to remove all references to Henderson and the edited version was read into the record.Â  Covert was tried together with his co-defendant, Henderson, and convicted of both charges.Â  Covert was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 25 years for the trafficking charge and 10 years for the distribution charge.Â  Covert now appeals.Â  \r\n        LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppression of Evidence\r\n            Covert contends the trial judge erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence and by applying a good faith exception to the statutory warrant requirement because the warrant was defective.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n            In criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â \r\n            â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n            During the trial, Covert and Henderson moved to suppress evidence seized during the search on the basis that although the search was conducted on September 26, 2002, the magistrateâ€™s signature is dated September 28, 2002 on the warrant itself.Â  The magistrateâ€™s signature and the date of September 26, 2002 only appear on two separate pages of the affidavit.Â  During the trial, Detective Timothy Conroy testified that he did not see the magistrate sign the search warrant on the 26th and that â€œmost probably she didnâ€™t sign that night and that was brought back to her on some other occasion to sign.â€Â  Upon finding the warrant was defective under section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003), the trial judge ruled a good faith exception to the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s exclusionary rule should apply to South Carolinaâ€™s statutory warrant requirement and denied the motion to suppress all evidence obtained during the September 26 search.\r\n            First, we must determine whether the warrant was defective because the signature was dated two days after the search was conducted.Â  Section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003) states that a warrant shall be â€œissued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€Â  Though the statute does not specifically require that the warrant be signed, it requires that it be â€œissued.â€Â  In Davis v. Sanders, 40 S.C. 507, 19 S.E. 138 (1894), â€œ[our supreme] court held that the warrant was not â€˜issuedâ€™ as required by law, and conferred no authority on the sheriff to make the arrest, because the magistrate did not sign at the foot as he intended to do, and because he did not intend the indorsement on the back as his signature of the warrant.â€Â \r\n            Du Bose v. Du Bose, 90 S.C. 87, 90, 72 S.E. 645, 646 (1911).Â  Therefore, a warrant is not issued until signed by an appropriate magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record.Â  See 77-370 S.C. Op. Attâ€™y Gen. 295 (1977) (stating a warrant is properly issued only when signed by the magistrate and only upon a sworn affidavit).Â  Thus, the warrant in this case was defective because there was no evidence that the magistrate signed the warrant before the search was conducted and the signature on the warrant is dated two days after the search was conducted.\r\n            Courts of other states have also held a search warrant must be signed because it is the confirmation that the magistrate determined the facts asserted in the affidavit support a finding of probable cause.[1]Â  In State v. Surowiecki, 440 A.2d 798, 799 (Conn. 1981), the Connecticut Supreme Court held that a warrant is not â€œissuedâ€ without a lawful signature on the search warrant by the person authorized to issue it.Â  The court reached this conclusion even though there was no doubt the judge intended to sign the search warrant and failed to do so because of a â€œmere oversight.â€Â  Id. at 798.Â  There are also several public policy considerations to support a requirement that the warrant be signed prior to a search: it impresses upon the magistrate the importance of his action in issuing a warrant; it discourages police misconduct by dictating that officers can not reasonably rely on an unsigned document as an authorization for conducting a search and by requiring officers to take corrective measures before they conduct a search; and it provides needed protections and assurances to persons in control of the property to be searched that the search has been authorized.Â \r\n            State v. Hentkowski, 397 N.W.2d 255, 258 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986).Â  Â Â \r\n            Having found the warrant was defective because the signature was dated two days after the search was conducted, we must next determine whether the good faith exception to the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s exclusionary rule should apply to South Carolinaâ€™s statutory warrant requirement.Â  The trial judge allowed the introduction of the evidence seized pursuant to a good faith exception as adopted by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).Â  The Leon rule applies when a search warrant is defective on Fourth Amendment grounds.Â  Id.Â  However, in this case, the evidence Covert sought to have excluded was obtained because of a defective search warrant based on a state statutory violation, not a constitutional violation.Â  \r\n            In South Carolina, the statutory warrant requirement is separate and distinct from the prohibition in the federal and state constitutions against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003); see U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  In fact, as the South Carolina Supreme Court has recognized, section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code actually imposes stricter warrant requirements than the constitutional provisions.Â  See State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2000).Â  Therefore, the Leon good faith exception is not applicable to this case and we must determine whether there is a good faith exception to the statutory warrant requirement in South Carolina.\r\n            In State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541, 559, 216 S.E.2d 501, 510 (1975), the Supreme Court of South Carolina found a good faith exception permits the introduction of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant that is defective under section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code if the officers have made a good faith attempt to comply with the affidavit requirement.Â  In Sachs, the affidavit the officers relied on contained misstated facts; however, the court determined that such misstatements in an affidavit were â€œnecessary hazardsâ€ encountered when federal and state authorities search in a joint effort and the affidavit satisfied a good-faith attempt to comply with the statute relating to search warrants.Â  Id.Â  \r\n            In State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 112-13, 352 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1987), the officers orally recited the facts upon which the warrant was based, but no affidavit was ever executed. Â As a result, the court found that there was no good faith effort to comply with the statute; however, the court declined to decide whether there is a good faith exception for officers who execute a search with objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant that is ultimately found to be invalid.Â  Id. at 114, 352 S.E.2d at 473.Â  The instant case falls somewhere between the cases of McKnight and Sachs.Â  This is not a case of the â€œnecessary hazardsâ€ of obtaining a warrant as in the case of Sachs and it is not a failure to comply with the statutory warrant requirement as in McKnight.Â  Here, the officers failed to notice that either the magistrate did not sign the warrant on September 26 or that the signature on the warrant itself was misdated as September 28, while the search was conducted on September 26, 2002.[2]Â  The officers could have discovered either error by simply looking at the warrant itself; therefore, we find there was no good faith effort to comply with the statute.\r\n            Because we find the warrant was defective and the good faith exception to the warrant requirement does not apply in this case, we must finally determine if the admission of the evidence found with the defective warrant constituted harmless error.Â  â€œError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial error not affecting the result.Â  State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 409, 613 S.E.2d 760, 784 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The violation found in this case cannot be seen as harmless error because exclusion of the evidence could have reasonably affected the result of the trial and the issue of the amount of cocaine allegedly possessed by Covert was a central issue in this case. \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTrafficking Statute Covert claims the judge erred by submitting the actual text of the trafficking statute to the jury in written form.Â  We agree.\r\n                This is a novel question of law in South Carolina; however, historically, as a common practice, trial judges in South Carolina have not given the actual text of a statute in written form to a jury.Â  The Court of Appeals of New York has ruled that the â€œconsent of defense counsel is an â€˜absolute preconditionâ€™ to furnishing the jury with the text of a statute because â€˜questions may arise concerning which sections of pertinent statutory material should be given to the jury.â€™â€Â  People v. Sanders, 70 N.Y.2d 837, 838 (N.Y. 1987) (citations omitted).Â  Therefore, we find that the judgeâ€™s submission of the actual text of the statute was in error because Covertâ€™s counsel did not consent to it being given to the jury.\r\n                REVERSED AND REMANDED. Â \r\n                ANDERSON, J., concurs in a separate opinion.Â  GOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.Â \r\n                ANDERSON, J., (concurring in a separate opinion):\r\n                I VOTE to reverse the conviction and sentence of the appellant and to remand for a new trial because of the egregious error committed by the circuit judge in submitting a copy of the trafficking statute to the trial jury.\r\n                PRESERVATION OF ERROR\r\n                After the circuit judge charged the jury and sent them back to the jury room to begin deliberations, the judge asked whether there were any exceptions from the State or the defense.Â  \r\n\r\n                Mr. Warder [counsel for Covert]:Â  Yes, sir.Â  Itâ€™s the procedure Iâ€™m beginning to object to.Â  Weâ€™ve now sent the jury out with a statute that providesâ€”\r\n                 The Court:Â  Did theyâ€”\r\n                 Mr. Warder:Â  â€”four ways toâ€”\r\n                The Court:Â  I meant to take up all those papers.Â  Go get those papers from them.Â  Every paper I gave them.Â  Sir, go ahead.\r\n                Mr. Warder:Â  Yes, sir.Â  We have a verdict form that in essence breaks the statute down in parts.Â  And, of course, for trafficking it gives them four different choices, all to find him guilty.Â  You know, I figure if we gave everybody enough choices, if we broke it down long enough we could have fifteen or twenty ways to find somebody guilty.Â  And I just think thatâ€™s highly prejudicial.\r\n                You know, Iâ€™d really like to send a sheet out that had the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof, and have it all broken down in one line sentences so they could read through and check, do you find that on each of them?Â  I mean, itâ€™s a way of highlighting the case to make it more likely that somebody will sooner or later check a yes.Â  And it seems to me that itâ€™s highly prejudicial.Â  \r\n                It seems to me like the form in itself tends to keep going until thereâ€™s a high probability that somebody will think theyâ€™re supposed to find one of the four.Â  They have four things, and theyâ€™re asked for an amount four times.Â  And I think that the juryâ€™s going to think that theyâ€™re supposed to fill one of them in and write an amount in.Â  And I justâ€”I just think itâ€™s prejudicial.\r\n                Mr. Abdalla:Â  Your honor, Iâ€™d like to be heard on that.Â  My position is Iâ€™d just rather have the indictment sent back as is with the way weâ€™veâ€”Iâ€™ve always thought it was guilty or not guilty.Â  And thatâ€™s just my position, your honor.\r\n                The Court:Â  Well, we canâ€™t do that because the jury has to determine the amount.Â  So we canâ€™t just send the indictments in.Â  I note your exceptions.Â  I donâ€™t think by splitting it out into four is doing anything but making it easier for the jury to understand.Â  Theyâ€™re going to still have every bit of it.Â  And in a case like this, I canâ€™t conceive a jury deliberating without having a copy of the statute.Â  Itâ€™s very frequently that a copy of the statute is sent back in, or some portion of the charge that they request be in writing, or sometimes the entire charge is sent back in writing.\r\n                Mr. Warder:Â  You know, Iâ€™ve heard of the entire charge being sent, but Iâ€™ve never heard of a court selecting the parts that they want to send back so it would be emphasized.Â  And Iâ€”\r\n                The Court:Â  Well, Iâ€™ve explained to them itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m emphasizing, itâ€™s trying to help them understand.\r\n                Mr. Warder:Â  I understand, but thatâ€™sâ€”\r\n                The Court:Â  Now I donâ€™t bring them backâ€”I donâ€™t object to bringing them back out and telling them that, you know, they canâ€™t find them guilty of anything unless the State has proven that particular charge beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  But I donâ€™t see how there can be any doubt in their minds of that fact.\r\n                Mr. Abdalla:Â  And, your honor, just for the record, Iâ€™ve joined in on Mr. Warderâ€™s objections.\r\n                The Court:Â  All right.Â  Well, it seems the verdict form doesnâ€™t suit anybody but me.Â  But thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s going back.Â  Iâ€™m going to make the couple of corrections that we made at the bench a few minutes ago and that I explained to the jury while I was going through it.Â  And then Iâ€™ll let you gentlemen look at it to be sure weâ€™ve done that before I send it back.Â  And then Iâ€™ll have it sent back.Â  So weâ€™ll be at ease a few minutes.\r\n                (Whereupon court was in recess)\r\n                The Court:Â  All right.Â  I have made the changes that we talked about to the verdict form.Â  If either one of you want to look at it the bailiff has it.Â  Mr. Warder, the jury has already asked that I send into them the definition of the trafficking statute, the print form.\r\n                 Mr. Warder:Â  Well, I meanâ€”\r\n                The Court:Â  And I note your objection.\r\n                Mr. Warder:Â  â€”itâ€™s predictable when we took it all to them.\r\n                The Court:Â  Well, itâ€™sâ€”I think itâ€™s proper.Â  I think itâ€™s good.Â  I think it would be worse not to do it than to do it.Â  So I overrule your objection.  \r\n\r\n                â€œThe general rule of issue preservation states that if an issue was not raised and ruled upon below, it will not be considered for the first time on appeal.â€Â  State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 583, 611 S.E.2d 273, 281 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d 691 (2003); State v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 564 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 2002)).Â  Our courts have â€œconsistently refused to apply the plain error rule.â€Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997) (citations omitted).Â  Instead, we have held: â€œit is the responsibility of counsel to preserve issues for appellate review.â€Â  Id.  \r\n                Our supreme court, in Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000), explained the rationale behind this longstanding rule:Â  \r\n\r\n                Imposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.Â  The requirement also serves as a keen incentive for a party to prepare a case thoroughly.Â  It prevents a party from keeping an ace card up his sleeveâ€”intentionally or by chanceâ€”in the hope that an appellate court will accept that ace card and, via a reversal, give him another opportunity to prove his case.\r\n\r\n                Id. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724 (citations omitted); see also Ellie, Inc. v. Micchichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€). \r\n                The rule that an unpreserved issue will not be considered on appeal does have its exceptions.Â  Foremost is the axiomatic principle of law that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime, including for the first time on appeal.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998); State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  Additionally, an exception exists where the interests of minors or incompetents are involved.Â  See Shake v. Darlington County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 306 S.C. 216, 219 n.2, 410 S.E.2d 923, 924 n.2 (Ct. App. 1991) (noting, in a termination of parental rights action, that â€œ[a]lthough it is questionable whether Mrs. Shake properly raised each of [the] grounds for termination at trial, we nevertheless address them all.â€); Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (approving the court of appealsâ€™ conclusion that procedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minors); Caughman v. Caughman, 247 S.C. 104, 109, 146 S.E.2d 93, 95 (1965) (holding that â€œthe duty to protect the rights of incompetents has precedence over procedural rules otherwise limiting the scope of review.â€).\r\n                Furthermore, our courts have developed the doctrine of futility, which recognizes that in circumstances where it would be futile to raise an objection to the trial judge, failure to raise the objection will be excused.Â  See State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 74, 447 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1994) (finding â€œ[a]s to counselâ€™s failure to raise an objection, the tone and tenor of the trial judgeâ€™s remarks concerning her gender and conduct were such that any objection would have been futile.â€); State v. Higgenbottom, 344 S.C. 11, 542 S.E.2d 718 (2001) (employing the futility doctrine). \r\n                In the present case, counsel for Covert perspicuously raised an objection (1) to the submission of the statute to the jury and (2) to the lack of a â€œnot guiltyâ€ option on the jury verdict form.Â  As to the judge providing the jury with a written copy of the statute, counsel professed, â€œWeâ€™ve now sent the jury out with a statute,â€ before his argument was interrupted by the court.Â  Counsel noted he had â€œnever heard of a court selecting the parts that they want to send back so it would be emphasized,â€ and averred, â€œYou know, Iâ€™d really like to send a sheet out that had the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof, and have it all broken down in one line sentences so they could read through and check, do you find that on each of them?â€Â  \r\n                Additionally, Covertâ€™s attorney took exception to the jury verdict formâ€™s failure to provide for the option of â€œnot guiltyâ€: â€œYou know, I figure if we gave everybody enough choices, if we broke it down long enough we could have fifteen or twenty ways to find somebody guilty.Â  And I just think thatâ€™s highly prejudicial.â€Â  \r\n                Lucidly, a contextual reading of the trial record demonstrates Covertâ€™s attorney timely objected both to the format of the jury verdict form and to the procedure of providing the jury with the trafficking statute.Â  The circuit judge acknowledged: â€œI note your exceptions,â€ and again, â€œ. . . I note your objection.â€Â  Further, the judge observed, â€œWell, it seems the verdict form doesnâ€™t suit anybody but me.Â  But thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s going back.â€Â  Finally, he pronounced: â€œSo I overrule your objection.â€Â  Pursuant to Rule 18 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure, â€œCounsel shall not attempt to further argue any matter after he has been heard and ruling of the court has been pronounced.â€Â  Rule 18(a), SCRCrimP.Â  My reading of the transcript leads me to the ineluctable conclusions that (1) counsel raised multiple objections to the jury verdict form and the submission of the statute, and (2) the court acknowledged and overruled the objections.Â  Therefore, both objections are pristinely preserved.\r\n                PREJUDICIAL SUBMISSION OF THE\r\n TRAFFICKING STATUTE TO THE JURY\r\n                Historically in South Carolina jurisprudence, circuit judges have NOT submitted in writing to the trial jury any portion of the jury charge.Â  The circuit judge committed a colossal prejudicial error in the instant case by submitting only the trafficking statute.Â  This practice defies fairness and justice by emphasizing the offense while ignoring the basic constitutional guarantees afforded the defendant which were in the jury charge, including: (1) the presumption of innocence; (2) the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) the credibility of witnesses; (4) an elemental analysis of the actual charge of which the defendant is accused; and (5) the right not to testify.Â  In my judgment, submitting the statute to the jury violated Covertâ€™s right to a fair trial.Â  \r\n                Admittedly, some states permit a judge to submit the jury charge to the fact finder for purposes of edification and enlightenment during jury deliberations.Â  Most of the states that allow this procedure do so through a court rule or statute.Â  \r\n                Under Louisiana law, after a court charges the jury, â€œa copy of the written charge shall be delivered to the jury if such delivery is consented to by both the defendant and the state in open court but not in the presence of the jury.â€Â  LSA-C.Cr.P. Art. 801(B)(1).Â  However, â€œNo charge shall be reduced to writing at the request of a juror pursuant to this Article unless consent is obtained from both the defendant and the state in open court but not within the presence of the jury.â€Â  LSA-C.Cr.P. Art. 808.Â  See State v. Joseph, 875 So.2d 1011, 1016-17 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2004) (â€œWith the 2001 amendments to LSA-C.Cr.P. arts. 801 and 808, it is now statutorily permissible for the jury to receive a copy of the written jury instructions to use during deliberations.Â  However, the use is clearly conditioned upon the consent of the parties.â€).\r\n                In Alabama,\r\n\r\n                Neither a copy of the charges against the defendant nor the â€œgivenâ€ written instructions shall go to the jury room; provided, however, that the court may, in its discretion, submit the written charges to the jury in a complex case.\r\n\r\n                Alabama RCRP Rule 21.1.Â  See Wright v. State, 740 So.2d 1147 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999).\r\n                The Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure require that written instructions be provided to the jury.Â  â€œThe court shall reduce its final instructions to writing or make an audio, electronic, or other recording of those instructions, provide at least one written copy or recording of those instruction to the jury for use during deliberations, and preserve those instructions for the record.â€Â  Ohio Crim. R. Rule 30(A); see State v. Kersey, 706 N.E.2d 818 (Ohio Ct. App. 1997).\r\n                Under the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure, â€œThe court may show the written instructions to the jury and permit the jury to take the written instructions to the jury room.â€Â  W.Va.Rules of Cr. P. 30; see State v. Lutz, 395 S.E.2d 478 (W.Va. 1988).\r\n                The law in Arkansas is succinctly declared by that stateâ€™s supreme court in Oliver v. State, 691 S.W.2d 842 (Ark. 1985): â€œA.R.Cr.P. Rule 33.3 clearly states it is the duty of the judge to deliver to the jury a typewritten copy of the oral instructions.Â  This is to be done upon the request of either party or any juror.â€Â  Id. at 842.\r\n                The California Penal Code provides:\r\n\r\n                Upon the jury retiring for deliberation, the court shall advise the jury of the availability of a written copy of the jury instructions. The court may, at its discretion, provide the jury with a copy of the written instructions given. However, if the jury requests the court to supply a copy of the written instructions, the court shall supply the jury with a copy.\r\n\r\n                Cal. Penal Code Â§ 1093(f) (West 2004).\r\n                The rule in Minnesota is:\r\n\r\n                (4) Giving of Instructions. The court in its discretion shall instruct the jury either before or after the arguments are completed except, at the discretion of the court, preliminary instructions need not be repeated. The instructions may be in writing and in the discretion of the court a copy may be taken to the jury room when the jury retires for deliberation.\r\n\r\n                Rules Crim. Proc., rule 26.03, subd. 18(4), 27A M.S.A.\r\n                Unlike Louisiana, Alabama, Ohio, West Virginia, Arkansas, California, and Minnesota, there is no court rule or statute in South Carolina which gives a judge the discretion to submit to the jury written copies the charge.Â  My research reveals no case from the appellate entities in South Carolina placing their imprimatur or approbation upon this practice.Â  \r\n                In Florida, \r\n\r\n                Under certain circumstances, it is reversible error for the trial court to provide the jury with a copy of only a portion of the jury instructions; if the trial court provides the jury with any written instructions, it must provide the jury with all of the instructions.Â  Van Loan v.

Cornett, 436 N.E.2d 765.Â  However, the trial court has discretion to send the entire body of written instructions to the jury â€œcleansedâ€ of extraneous information.Â  Mitchell v.

State, 455 N.E.2d 905 (Ind. 1983) (â€œIt is also the general rule of law that jury instructions are not to be sent to the jury room.â€). \r\n                Pursuant to statute in New York,\r\n\r\n                At any time during its deliberation, the jury may request the court for further instruction or information with respect to the law, with respect to the content or substance of any trial evidence, or with respect to any other matter pertinent to the juryâ€™s consideration of the case. Upon such a request, the court must direct that the jury be returned to the courtroom and, after notice to both the people and counsel for the defendant, and in the presence of the defendant, must give such requested information or instruction as the court deems proper. With the consent of the parties and upon the request of the jury for further instruction with respect to a statute, the court may also give to the jury copies of the text of any statute which, in its discretion, the court deems proper.\r\n\r\n                N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law Â§ 310.30 (McKinney 2002).Â  In People v. Johnson, 81 N.Y.2d 980, 981-82 (N.Y. 1993), the Court of Appeals of New York held:\r\n\r\n                We affirm the order of the Appellate Division because CPL 310.30 prohibits giving â€œcopies of the text of any statuteâ€ to a deliberating jury without the consent of the parties. Here, defendant expressly objected to complying with the juryâ€™s request to receive the entire charge in writing, which included statutory textual material.\r\n                \r\n The fact that CPL 310.30 allows a deliberating jury to â€œrequest the court for further instruction or information * * * with respect to any * * * matter pertinent to the juryâ€™s consideration of the caseâ€ does not impliedly authorize an override of the specific prohibition.Â  Inasmuch as the entire written jury instruction included forbidden statutory textual material, the Appellate Division correctly concluded that the trial court committed reversible error in providing that material to the jury over defendantâ€™s objection (see, People v. Taylor, 76 N.Y.2d 873, 560 N.Y.S.2d 982, 561 N.E.2d 882; People v. Nimmons, 72 N.Y.2d 830, 530 N.Y.S.2d 543, 526 N.E.2d 33; People v. Owens, 69 N.Y.2d 585, 516 N.Y.S.2d 619, 509 N.E.2d 314).\r\n\r\n                The New York case of People v. Sanders, 70 N.Y.2d 837 (N.Y. 1987), is particularly on point.Â  In Sanders, the Court of Appeals of New York ruled the â€œconsent of defense counsel is an â€˜absolute preconditionâ€™ to furnishing the jury with the text of a statute because â€˜questions may arise concerning which sections of pertinent statutory material should be given to the jury.â€™â€Â  Sanders at 838.\r\n                Because South Carolina has no applicable statute or rule, I vote to reverse Covertâ€™s conviction on the ground that submission of only the trafficking statute to the jury tainted the fairness of his trial.\r\n                JURY VERDICT FORM\r\n                In addition to the submission of the trafficking statute, I find prejudicial error in the courtâ€™s verdict form.Â  The jury verdict form utilized by the circuit judge read as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Trafficking in Cocaine\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        Do you unanimously find, beyond a reasonable doubt that Kevin Paul Covert:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Knowingly sold, manufactured, cultivated, delivered, purchased or brought into this state 10 grams or more of cocaine?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        YESÂ  ______Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  NOÂ  ______\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         If yes, how many grams?

Myers, 344 S.C. 532, 536, 544 S.E.2d 851, 853 (Ct. App. 2001), observed,\r\n\r\n                It is the preferred practice to submit the possible verdict of â€œnot guiltyâ€ to the jury; however, the law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented.Â  State v. Somerset, 276 S.C. 220, 221, 277 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1981); State v. Rogers, 275 S.C. 485, 486, 272 S.E.2d 792, 792 (1980).Â  A jury should be instructed that one verdict it can reach is â€œnot guilty,â€ especially where the crime charged is of a serious nature.Â  State v. Griggs, 184 S.C. 304, 315-16, 192 S.E. 360, 365 (1937) (stating that where the trial judge in his charge instructed the jury that if it had a reasonable doubt as to appellantâ€™s guilt it must find him not guilty, there is no reversible error if the trial judge then fails to tell the jury that â€œnot guiltyâ€ is one verdict it could render).\r\n\r\n                (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\n                The Myers court found the â€œtrial judgeâ€™s clear and cogent jury instructions ameliorated any possible prejudice emanating from the failure to include â€˜not guiltyâ€™ on the verdict form.â€Â  Id.Â  In contradistinction to the judgeâ€™s â€œclear and cogent jury instructionsâ€ in Myers, the judgeâ€™s jury instructions in this case failed to immunize the verdict form due to the improper and prejudicial act of submitting the trafficking statute to the jury.Â  Not only was the jury inundated with the many ways it could find the defendant guilty, the defective verdict form omitted the â€œnot guiltyâ€ option.Â  Therefore, the judgeâ€™s charging practice compounded the prejudice of the verdict form rather than ameliorating it.\r\n                â€œA denial of due process occurs when a defendant in a criminal trial is denied the fundamental fairness essential to the concept of justice.â€Â  State v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 129, 484 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1997) (citation omitted).Â  I find the circuit judgeâ€™s overemphasis of the ways the jury could find Covert guilty and the concomitant underemphasis of Covertâ€™s fundamental and constitutionally guaranteed rights encouraged the jury, again and again, to find the defendant guilty.Â  The result in the instant case is that the jury was excessively encouraged to find the defendant guilty, rendering the trial unfair.Â  Covert was deprived of due process of law.Â  Accordingly, I VOTE to REVERSE the conviction and sentence and REMAND for a new trial.Â  \r\n                ___________________Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n                GOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):Â  I would affirm the judgment below and for that reason I write separately.Â  \r\n                1.Â  Covert maintains the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence due to what Covert claims was a defective warrant and in applying a good faith exception to a statutory warrant requirement.\r\n                On September 26, 2002, Greenville Detective Timothy Conroy, after being sworn by a magistrate to tell the truth, applied to the magistrate for a warrant authorizing the search of Covertâ€™s residence. The affidavit Conroy submitted in support of his application for a search warrant provided a description of the premises to be searched and the property sought.Â  His application also incorporated an attached one-page, second affidavit that presented the facts on which he set forth probable cause for issuance of the search warrant.Â  The date of September 26, 2002, and the signatures of Conroy and the magistrate appear on the affidavit and its attachment.Â  Â Â \r\n                Later, at Covertâ€™s trial, Conroy testified in camera the magistrate reviewed his affidavit and issued the search warrant.Â  Conroy also testified he and other officers, with the affidavit and search warrant in hand, immediately executed the search warrant at Covertâ€™s residence.Â  An officer other than Conroy signed the return on September 27, 2002; however, the search warrant, which the magistrate signed, bears the date of the following day, i.e., September 28, 2002.Â  \r\n                Covert moved to suppress the evidence seized from his residence pursuant to the search warrant, pointing to evidence that the search occurred prior to the date that appears on the search warrant and claiming the magistrate failed to sign the warrant prior to its execution.Â  The trial court, however, upheld the search, basing its holding, as noted above and as Judge Shortâ€™s opinion more fully discusses, on a good faith exception.[3]Â  \r\n                Unlike Judge Short and the trial court, I see no need to address the question of whether a good faith exception should be applied in an instance where the issuing magistrateâ€™s signature reflects a date later than those appearing on the affidavit and the return.Â  Another ground appearing in the record supports the judgment of the trial court.[4]Â  \r\n                The validity of the search warrant did not depend either upon a date appearing above the magistrateâ€™s signature nor upon there being a signature of the issuing judicial officer.Â  Nothing in the statute governing the issuance of search warrants in South Carolina, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003),[5] as Judge Short himself acknowledges, â€œspecifically require[s] that the [search] warrant be signed.â€Â  Moreover, nothing in the statute requires it to be dated, for that matter. \r\n                Here, the magistrate either wrote an incorrect date on the warrant when she signed it or failed to sign the warrant when she issued it, but then signed and dated the warrant after the officer returned it.Â  At most, the omission of the date and signature or of the date when a magistrate issues a search warrant, without more, constitutes a ministerial defect that does not affect its validity.[6]Â  And as this court has held, a ministerial error will not invalidate an otherwise valid search warrant under section 17-13-140.[7]\r\n                I add one final note regarding the search warrant.Â  Covert does not argue the search warrant otherwise failed to meet either constitutional[8] or statutory standards.Â  He does not contend the magistrate did not issue the search warrant, she lacked probable cause to issue it, or she did not intend to issue it.Â  \r\n                2.Â  Covert argues the trial court abused its discretion in not granting a mistrial when the lawyer for Covertâ€™s codefendant, Charles Henderson, made an apparently factually incorrect statement regarding Covert during closing argument.Â  \r\n                In his closing argument, Hendersonâ€™s counsel attacked the credibility of Donald Myers and Roger Harris, both of whom testified about buying cocaine from Covert and Henderson.Â  Counsel pointed to Myersâ€™s statements to the police and said the first time Myers implicated Henderson was after Myers received a free â€œget out of jail card.â€Â  Counsel followed this assertion with the remark that â€œ[a]ccording to Mr. Covert[,] he confirmed that Roger [Harris] . . . had been buying cocaine from him for two yearsâ€ and that Myersâ€™s statement didnâ€™t â€œmention Mr. Henderson in a conspiracy with him.â€Â  Covert objected, arguing this undermined Covertâ€™s credibility because counsel had mentioned Hendersonâ€™s involvement and counselâ€™s statement created the impression in the juryâ€™s mind that Covert had been dishonest with the police when he gave his statement to them following his arrest.Â  Covertâ€™s criminal involvement with Henderson had earlier been redacted from Covertâ€™s published statement to the police.Â  \r\n                Covert refused an offer by the trial judge for a curative instruction and insisted on a mistrial.Â  \r\n                The question of whether to grant or deny a motion for mistrial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court[9] whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.[10]  \r\n                The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this instance.Â  The reference to Covert was an isolated one and was not directed to Covertâ€™s guilt, but to the veracity of Myers.Â  Moreover, evidence as to Covertâ€™s guilt in the context of the entire record was overwhelming, particularly since he admitted to selling cocaine both before and after September 26, 2002.[11]\r\n                3.Â  Covert further contends the trial court erred in not sustaining his objection to the closing argument of the solicitor.Â  \r\n                After counsel for Covert offered a general objection to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, the trial court effectively sustained the objection, saying, â€œYes, sir.Â  I think you need to move on to the facts of the case.â€Â  Covert neither moved to strike the objectionable portion of the solicitorâ€™s argument nor moved for a curative instruction or mistrial.Â  Having gotten what he asked for, Covert cannot complain now.[12]  \r\n                4.Â  Covert also complains about the special verdict forms and copies of the trafficking statute given by the trial court to the jury in connection with its charge on the offense of trafficking.Â  The forms contained no statements regarding the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof.Â  He claims these written materials had the effect of suggesting a guilty verdict to the jury.\r\n                Covert suffered no prejudice.Â  Indeed, the trial courtâ€™s oral jury instructions, which Covert did not challenge, removed any possible prejudice Covert may have suffered on account of the use by the jury of the forms and copies of the trafficking statute.[13]Â  Moreover, the trial court made it abundantly clear to the jury that a â€œnot guiltyâ€ verdict was one of the possible verdicts it could return with regard to each charge, notwithstanding the special verdict form did not have the words â€œnot guiltyâ€ printed upon it.Â  As for the copy of the trafficking statute given each juror, it merely provided additional information regarding an offense with which Covert was charged and served to aid the jury in reaching a proper verdict.\r\n                5.Â  Regarding Covertâ€™s argument that a cumulative effect of errors requires a reversal of his conviction, the issue is not preserved for appeal, even assuming the presence of â€œerrors.â€Â  The issue was neither raised to nor ruled on by the trial court.[14]Â  In any case, the purported errors, which Covert says involve the closing arguments and the written materials given the jury, are insufficient to warrant a new trial when weighed against the evidence of Covertâ€™s guilt, particularly when his statement to the police is considered.Â  \r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n[1] Courts in other states have made the same determination:Â  Kelley v. State, 316 So.2d 233 (Ala. Crim. App. 1975); Martin v. State, 344 So.2d 248 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976); Byrd v. Commonwealth, 261 S.W.2d 437 (Ky. Ct. App. 1953); United States v. Carignan, 286 F.Supp. 284 (Mass. Dist. Ct. 1967); People v. Hentkowski, 397 N.W.2d 255 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986); State v. Fleming, 227 S.W.2d 106 (Mo. Ct. App. 1950); State v. Williams, 565 N.E.2d 563 (Ohio 1991); State v. Cochrane, 173 N.W.2d 495 (S.D. 1970).\r\n[2] The State did not offer any evidence that the magistrate signed the warrant on September 26, 2002, and the magistrate did not testify at trial.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The trial court, over Covertâ€™s objection, later admitted as a court exhibit the search warrant log maintained by the magistrate; however, the trial court did not change its earlier ruling regarding the sufficiency of the search warrant.\r\n[4]Â  See State v. Arnold, 319 S.C. 256, 460 S.E.2d 403 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding Rule 220(c), SCACR, allows the court of appeals to affirm on any ground appearing in the record); see also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (holding under Rules 208(b)(2) and 220(c), SCACR, a respondent, as a prevailing party in the trial court, may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the trial court regardless of whether the reasons were presented to or ruled on by the trial court, provided the respondentâ€™s additional sustaining grounds appear in the record on appeal).\r\n[5]Â  Section 17-13-140 provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\nAny magistrate . . . having jurisdiction over the area where the property sought is located, may issue a search warrant to search for and seize . . . any . . . drugs . . . possessed . . . in violation of any of the laws of this State . . . .\r\nÂ Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nA warrant issued hereunder shall be issued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate . . . establishing the grounds for the warrant.Â  If the magistrate . . . is satisfied that the grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person or place to be searched.\r\n\r\n[6]Â  See State v. Smith, 562 N.E.2d 428 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990) (noting the search warrant statute contained no explicit requirement that the issuing magistrate sign a search warrant in order to validate it and holding the failure of the issuing judge to sign a search warrant did not invalidate the warrant when the magistrate found probable cause and intended to issue it; the court concluded the addition of a signature was a ministerial task); Commonwealth v. Pellegrini, 539 N.E.2d 514 (Mass. 1989) (holding a failure of a judge to sign a warrant was a ministerial error that did not invalidate the warrant in the absence of a constitutional or statutory requirement that the issuing judge, without exception, sign a search warrant); see also Yuma County Attorney v. McGuire, 512 P.2d 14, 15-16 (Ariz. 1973) (stating even where the statute required a magistrateâ€™s signature, â€œ[w]arrants and the affidavits on which they are based must be read in a common-sense way rather than technicallyâ€ and holding a magistrateâ€™s inadvertent failure to sign a search warrant was an oversight that did not invalidate the warrant where the judge signed the affidavit in support of the warrant and considered the existence of probable cause and thus intended by his action to give legal effect to the issuance of the warrant); People v. Superior Court, 141 Cal. Rptr. 917 (Ct. App. 1977) (holding a magistrateâ€™s inadvertent failure to sign a search warrant did not require suppression of evidence seized pursuant thereto); State v. Spaulding, 720 P.2d 1047 (Kan. 1986) (holding where a judge made findings of probable cause and intentionally issued a search warrant, the warrant was not void because the issuing judge failed to sign it where the warrant was executed and returned to the same judge and filed on the same date it was issued); State v. Andries, 297 N.W.2d 124 (Minn. 1980) (stating the requirement that an issuing judge sign a search warrant is a purely ministerial task); cf. S.C. Op. Atty. Gen. 295 (1977) (advising, per the attorney general, that only judicial officers may sign a search warrant).Â  \r\nThe Arizona, California, and Minnesota statutes, respectively Ariz. Rev. Stat. Â§ 13-1441 (now renumbered as Â§ 13-3911), Cal. Penal Code Â§ 1523, and Minn. Stat. Ann. Â§Â§ 626.05 and 626.11, expressly require a search warrant to be signed.Â  Yet, the appellate courts of these three states found the lack of a signature to be ministerial in nature.Â  Other courts, however, hold a failure to sign a warrant invalidates the warrant and renders its issuance a nullity where the statutes expressly require a signature by a judicial officer.Â  See, e.g., Kelley v. State, 316 So. 2d 233 (Ala. Crim. App. 1975) (discussing a statute defining a search warrant as â€œan order in writing in the name of the state, signed by a magistrateâ€); Martin v. State, 344 So. 2d 248, 249 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976) (noting the statute contained language stating that the magistrate shall â€œissue a search warrant signed by himâ€). \r\n[7]Â  See, e.g., State v. Weaver, 361 S.C. 73, 602 S.E.2d 786 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding a failure to observe the requirement that search warrants be executed and a return made within ten days after the date of the warrant does not invalidate the search); State v. Mollison, 319 S.C. 41, 459 S.E.2d 88 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating the failure to list on the return all the items seized or to make the return within ten days is a ministerial error that does not invalidate the search).\r\n[8]Â  Article 1, section 10 of the South Carolina Constitution, which mirrors the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, contains no signature and dating requirement.Â  S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 10. It requires only that the warrant issue â€œupon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, the person or thing to be seized, and the information to be obtained.â€Â  Id.\r\n[9]Â  State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to the McDills and ordered that their automobile insurance policies be reformed to include UIM coverage up to the liability coverage limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nBy order of this court, we held the appeal in abeyance pending the resolution of a second lawsuit, McDill v. Markâ€™s Auto Sales, Inc., a tort action involving the determination of liability for the automobile accident in which the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.Â  The action was brought by Gerri McDill on behalf of herself and her son Garrett against Lawhon, as well as Lawhonâ€™s father, his grandfather, and his grandfatherâ€™s automobile dealership, Markâ€™s Auto Sales, Inc., which was the owner of the vehicle Lawhon was driving in the accident.Â  \r\nSince we have affirmed the judgment finding no liability for the defendants in McDill v. Markâ€™s Auto Sales, Inc., Op. No. 4068 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 9, 2006), the question of UIM coverage has now become moot because our decision will have no practical legal effect upon the existing controversy.Â  As noted by our supreme court:Â  \r\n\r\nAn appellate court will not pass on moot and academic questions or make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.Â \r\nJackson v. State, 331 S.C. 486, 489 S.E.2d 915 (1997).Â  Moot appeals differ from unripe appeals in that moot appeals result when intervening events render a case nonjusticiable.Â  See Jean Hoefer Toal, Shahin Vafai &amp; Robert A. Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina 122 (1999).Â  â€œA case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€ Mathis v.

State, 345 S.C. 557, 567-68, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596&nbsp;(2001) (alterations in original).\r\nIn the underlying tort case, a jury determined the McDills were not entitled to any damages from the owner or driver of the underinsured vehicle; therefore, we hold the McDills would not be entitled to UIM coverage under either Nationwide policy even if the policies were reformed to provide UIM coverage.Â  The Nationwide policies provided as follows:\r\n\r\nWe will pay damages . . . because of bodily injury suffered by you or a relative, and because of property damage.Â  Such damages must be due by law to you or a relative from the owner or driver of:Â  . . . an underinsured motor vehicle . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nThus, since the underlying tort action was decided adversely to the McDills, they are not entitled to UIM coverage because they are not entitled to damages from the driver of the underinsured motor vehicle.Â  Any opinion on whether the policies should be reformed would, therefore, be merely advisory.[1]Â  Cf. Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Metro Courier Corp., 507 S.E.2d 525 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998) (holding an automobile insurerâ€™s declaratory judgment action to determine coverage issues, including the duty to defend, was moot once the insurer had denied coverage and refused to defend and a judgment was entered on the underlying suit because a court is not permitted to issue advisory opinions); see also In re Chance, 277 S.C. 161, 161, 284 S.E.2d 231, 231 (1981) (noting South Carolina appellate courts have â€œconsistently refrainedâ€ from issuing purely advisory opinions).\r\nII.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we vacate the trial courtâ€™s order in the current appeal that granted summary judgment to the McDills and reformed the policies to include UIM coverage.\r\nVACATED.\r\nSHORT, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We note that, unless a party is trying to obtain coverage for an accident that has already occurred, litigation to reform an insurance policy to include UIM coverage would not be necessary.Â  Where there is no current accident and UIM coverage is desired, a party could simply add such coverage with an agent to protect against future losses.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4073","title":"Gillman v.

Scott Graber, of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  Esther Gillman appeals the trial courtâ€™s ruling, dismissing her claim for negligence against the South Carolina Department of Transportation and the State of South Carolina.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 27, 2001, Gillman was walking along a sidewalk in Beaufort when she fell because the sidewalk was uneven.Â  On May 22, 2003, Gillman filed her initial complaint against the City of Beaufort, City of Beaufort Department of Public Works, St. Helenaâ€™s Parish, Inc., and the Protestant Church of the Diocese of South Carolina for injuries she sustained to her wrist and knee as a result of the fall.Â  All of the defendants answered on June 23, 2003 and each asserted that it did not own or exercise control over the sidewalk.Â  \r\nAfter Gillman learned the sidewalk was located on a right of way owned by the South Carolina Department of Transportation, she filed a motion to join SCDOT and the State of South Carolina (collectively â€œthe Stateâ€) as an indispensable party pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  On June 24, 2004, more than three years after the accident, the trial court ordered the State added as an indispensable party to the lawsuit because the State owned the sidewalk.Â  The trial court also granted summary judgment in favor of St. Helenaâ€™s Parish and the Protestant Church, and denied summary judgment to the City of Beaufort and the City of Beaufort Public Works Department.Â  Thereafter, on July 24, 2004, Gillman filed an amended summons and complaint adding the State as a defendant. Â \r\nThe State filed a motion to dismiss, asserting the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  On November 12, 2004, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGillman argues the trial court erred in dismissing her action against the State based on the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 19, SCRCP allows a court to join, whenever possible, persons materially interested in an action so that a complete determination may be made.Â  Rule 19 states:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(a) Persons to Be Joined if Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined, the court shall order that he be made a party. If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\r\n\r\nGillman argues that because Rule 19(a) does not contain an express limitation proscribing the courtâ€™s power to effectuate joinder of parties against whom the statute of limitations has run, the trial court must join a necessary party even if the statute of limitations would otherwise bar the claim.[1]Â  Gillman also assets that our supreme courtâ€™s decision in BancOhio Natâ€™l Bank v. Neville, 310 S.C. 323, 426 S.E.2d 773 (1993), indicates there is no limitation on a courtâ€™s power to add an indispensable party.Â  In BancOhio the supreme court ordered the State added as a party after an action was filed, tried, and heard on appeal because the State was a necessary party.Â  Id. at 329, 426 S.E.2d at 777.Â  BancOhio involved a property dispute concerning the closure of a roadway, and there was no statute of limitations which would have barred the claim against the State or limited the courtâ€™s power to add the State as a necessary party pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  Id. at 328-29, 426 S.E.2d at 777.Â  Therefore, BancOhio is distinguishable from the case at bar because Gillman is asserting a negligence cause of action against the State, to which the South Carolina Tort Claims Act applies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (2005).Â  \r\nThe Tort Claims Act is a limited waiver of governmental immunity, and sets forth a maximum three-year statute of limitations in which negligence actions may be brought against the state.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (2005)Â  (â€œExcept as provided for in Section 15&#8209;3&#8209;40, any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless an action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should have been discovered;Â  provided, that if the claimant first filed a claim pursuant to this chapter then the action for damages based upon the same occurrence is forever barred unless the action is commenced within three years of the date the loss was or should have been discovered.â€) \r\nÂ Under the discovery rule, the statutory limitations period begins to run from the date when the injury resulting from the wrongful conduct either is discovered or may be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.Â  Cline v. J.E. Faulkner Homes, Inc., 359 S.C. 367, 371-72, 597 S.E.2d 27, 29 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The date when a plaintiff learns of a potential new defendant has absolutely no bearing on the timing of the statute of limitations.Â  Id. at 371, 597 S.E.2d at 29.\r\nOur courts have not specifically addressed the question of whether an indispensable party may assert the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense when the party is joined pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP, after the applicable statute of limitations has expired.Â  However, it is well established that the statute of limitations operates as a defense to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of action, and unless the action is commenced before the expiration of the limitations period, the plaintiffâ€™s claim is barred.Â  City of North Myrtle Beach v. Lewis-Davis, 360 S.C. 225, 230-31, 599 S.E.2d 462, 464 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Blyth v. Marcus, 322 S.C. 150, 152-53, 444 S.E.2d 512 (1994); see also Bagwell v. Hinton, 205 S.C 377, 393, 32 S.E.2d 147, 153-54 (1944) (holding, in a pre-rule decision, that a statute providing for the amendment of pleadings does not permit a court, under color of ordering an amendment, to abrogate the statute of limitations). \r\nWe can find nothing in Rule 19 that prohibits a defendant from raising an affirmative defense, such as the statute of limitations, when a plaintiff attempts to join the party as necessary for a just adjudication.Â  Moreover, Rule 12(b), SCRCP, expressly permits a party to assert every defense, in law or fact, that he may have in responsive pleadings.Â  The parties agree that Gillmanâ€™s accident occurred on May 27, 2001.Â  Gillman did not serve the State until July 21, 2004, after the trial court ordered it joined as an indispensable party.Â  The State asserted the statue of limitations as a defense, and the trial court dismissed the claim because more then three years had elapsed between the date of the injury and the date the State was joined as a necessary party.Â  Because we can discern nothing that deprives a party joined under Rule 19 of any defense it may have, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant the Stateâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Gillman does not argue that the amendment to her pleading adding the State as a party relates back to the date of the original pleading under Rule 15, SCRCP; therefore, we do not address that issue.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4074","title":"Schnellmann v.

Pleasant, for Appellants.Â  \r\nMax G. Mahaffee, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Rick and Jennifer Schnellmann appeal the grant of summary judgment in favor of Nancy Roettger on claims of negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and unfair trade practices.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn June of 2001, the Schnellmanns engaged Island Realty, Inc. to aid them in purchasing residential property in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.Â  The Schnellmanns advised their chosen representative, Island Realty, that they wanted to purchase a home in excess of 3,000 square feet.Â  Roettger, who was affiliated with another real estate firm, was the listing agent for property located at 2958 Pignatelli Crescent.Â  Roettger advertised the property in the Charleston Trident Multiple Listing Service as having approximately 3,350 square feet.Â  Island Realty sent information about the property to the Schnellmanns, and the Schnellmanns entered into a purchase contract with the sellers.Â  Additionally, the Schnellmanns gave Island Realty power of attorney to act on their behalf regarding the purchase.Â  After closing, the Schnellmanns acquired information indicating the home was only 2,987 square feet, and this lawsuit ensued.[2]Â  The trial court granted Roettgerâ€™s motion for summary judgment on all claims.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nTo state a claim for negligent misrepresentation a plaintiff must show (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to communicate truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as a result of such reliance.Â  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 473, 581 S.E.2d 496, 504 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The Schnellmanns argue that the trial court erred in concluding their reliance on Roettgerâ€™s representation was unreasonable and they suffered no damages.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe record shows that the MLS listing for the property indicated the square footage given was an approximation â€œdeemed reliable but not guaranteed.â€[3]Â  The listing also included the following disclaimer:Â  â€œIF EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, MEASURE, MEASURE!â€Â  Furthermore, the sales contract granted the purchaser the privilege, and responsibility, to inspect the home prior to closing, the wording of the clause including specifically the homeâ€™s square footage.Â  A summary appraisal revealing the lesser square footage was performed prior to the closing.Â  A copy of the report was not requested by the Schnellmanns.Â  \r\nIt is well established that â€œthere can be no liability for casual statements, representations as to matters of law, or matters which plaintiff could ascertain on his own in the exercise of due diligence.â€Â  Robertson v. First Union Natâ€™l Bank, 350 S.C. 339, 348, 565 S.E.2d 309, 314 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 134, 533 S.E.2d 334, 337 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  The Schnellmanns could have discovered the misstatement by simply requesting a copy of the appraisal or by having someone come in to measure the property.Â  They were informed via the MLS listing that the measurements were not precise.Â  The Schnellmanns viewed the house, and proceeded with the purchase without finally determining the exact square footage.Â  In light of the evidence presented, we agree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that if the Schnellmanns relied on the approximation of the square footage contained in the listing, such reliance was unreasonable as a matter of law.Â  \r\nWe also agree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusions that the Schnellmanns suffered no damages as a result of the misstatement.Â  As previously discussed, the property was appraised at the time of purchase and possibly again several months later as part of a refinancing.[4]Â  The appraisals report a value more than the $478,000 purchase price paid by the Schnellmanns and reflect the square footage of the home is less than 3,000 square feet.Â  The Schnellmanns walked through the property prior to the purchase and agreed to pay the $478,000 purchase price.Â  Dr. Schnellmann testified, and his wife agreed, they were not arguing the value of the home at the time of purchase was less than what they paid.Â  \r\n\r\nQ.&nbsp; And I understand from your direct testimony or, Iâ€™m sorry, your earlier testimony to Mr. Mahaffee, that youâ€™re not arguing with whether or not the house is in fact worth or was, at the time of sale, worth $478,000.Â  You argue and contest the square footage.\r\nA.&nbsp; Correct.\r\nQ.&nbsp; But not the value.\r\nA.&nbsp; Uh, yes.\r\nQ.&nbsp; Is that correct?\r\nA.&nbsp; Yes.\r\n\r\nConsidering this evidence and testimony, the trial court properly concluded there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the issue of damages.Â  \r\nII.Â  Fraud\r\nThe trial court likewise granted Roettgerâ€™s request for summary judgment as to fraud based on the Schnellmannsâ€™ unreasonable reliance and lack of injury.Â  To establish a claim of fraud, plaintiffs must show by clear and convincing evidence (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the plaintiff act upon the representation; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.Â  King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 311, 318 S.E.2d 125, 127 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The Schnellmannsâ€™ inability to establish the last two of the nine requisite elements of fraud make the trial courtâ€™s award of summary judgment entirely appropriate.Â  See Oâ€™Shields v. Southern Fountain Mobile Homes, Inc., 262 S.C. 276, 281, 204 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1974) (â€œFailure to prove any one of the . . . elements [of fraud] is fatal to recovery.â€).Â  \r\nIII.Â  Unfair Trade Practices\r\nFinally, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Roettger on the unfair trade practices claim because the acts complained of did not affect the public interest nor result in a pecuniary injury to the Schnellmanns.Â  â€œThe statute clearly requires that in order to recover pursuant to the UTPA one must prove . . . : 1) a violation of the Act [by the commission of an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce], 2) proximate cause, and 3) damages.â€Â  Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 482, 458 S.E.2d 431, 438 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  To be associated with trade or commerce, a defendantâ€™s acts must impact the public interest.Â  Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co.&nbsp;v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996).Â  An impact on the public interest may be shown if the acts or practices have the potential for repetition.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 387, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).Â  The potential for repetition may be shown by proving that the same kind of actions occurred in the past or by showing that the procedures employed by the defendant create a potential for repetition of the deceptive practices.Â  Id. at 388, 496 S.E.2d at\r\n23. In the present case, there was no evidence presented that Roettger had misstated square footage in MLS listings in the past or that any procedure regularly employed by her would cause this misstatement to be made again.Â  Even if a public impact had been shown, the Schnellmanns, as discussed above, suffered no pecuniary loss.\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  A second measurement taken by the Schnellmannsâ€™ expert revealed the square footage of the house was closer to 3,087 square feet.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The listing stated:Â  Apx SqFt:Â  3,350. \r\n[4] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Dr. Schnellmann was uncertain whether the appraisal he saw indicating the home was less than 3,000 square feet was performed at the time of the closing or a subsequent appraisal performed at the time of refinancing.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4075","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor C. Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â William R. Douglas (Douglas) was convicted of committing a lewd act upon a minor and sentenced to twelve years.Â  On appeal, Douglas argues the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Gwen L. Herod as an expert in forensic interviewing and in disallowing the testimony of Amelia Douglas that the victim lied to her in the past.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn February of 2003, Cathryn Douglas and her daughter (the victim) talked about â€œthe birds and the bees.â€Â  Cathryn told the victim â€œabout sex, [the] difference between [a] man and woman . . ., and not to do things with the man and if a man was to touch her for her to come out and say.â€Â  At that time, the victim informed Cathryn that Douglas, Cathrynâ€™s husband, had â€œdone that to her.â€Â  The victim advised Cathryn that Douglas had touched her inappropriately during the summer and fall of 2002, when she was seven years old.Â  Cathryn called the victimâ€™s grandmother, with whom the victim lived.Â  The victim told her grandmother what occurred.Â  Victimâ€™s grandmother notified the Sumter County Sheriffâ€™s Department.\r\nOn February 10, 2003, Officer Doris McGee, the investigator assigned to the case, contacted the victimâ€™s grandmother and asked to see the victim as soon as possible.Â  That same day, the victim was interviewed by Gwen L. Herod, a victim assistance officer with the Sumter County Sheriffâ€™s Office. Â Based on this interview, Herod recommended the victim be taken for a medical examination at the Durant Childrenâ€™s Center in Florence.\r\nDuring this time, Kathy Saunders worked as a pediatric nurse practitioner at the Durant Childrenâ€™s Center.Â  On February 21, 2003, Saunders examined the victim and found tearing on her vaginal opening and scarring on her fossa, which â€œsits . . . just in front of the hymen.â€\r\nDouglas was charged with first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and committing a lewd act upon a minor.Â  At trial, the victim declared that (1) Douglasâ€™ â€œweenieâ€ touched her mouth; (2) Douglas stuck his â€œweenieâ€ into her â€œpee peeâ€; (3) Douglasâ€™ mouth touched her â€œboobsâ€; (4) he â€œput his mouth into [her] mouthâ€; and (5) â€œthe white stuff came out of [Douglasâ€™] weenie.â€Â  Douglas called his mother, Amelia Douglas, in part to impeach the victimâ€™s testimony that the victim â€œtold the truth to her.â€\r\nThe State offered Herod as an expert in forensic interviewing.Â  In addition, Saunders testified about the medical examination she performed on the victim, the vaginal tears, and the fossal scarring.Â  Saunders opined that â€œthe impression of the vaginal exam was that it was consistent with past penetration.â€\r\nThe jury found Douglas guilty of committing a lewd act upon a minor.Â  The trial court granted a mistrial on the criminal sexual conduct charge.Â  The judge sentenced Douglas to twelve years.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Â State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Walker, Â Â S.C.Â  , 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This\r\nCourt does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 613 S.E.2d 760 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDouglas asserts the trial court erred in allowing Herod to testify as an expert in forensic interviewing because (1) forensic interviewing is not a recognized area of expertise; (2) Herodâ€™s testimony improperly bolstered the victimâ€™s testimony; and (3) the probative value of Herodâ€™s testimony was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\r\nI.Â  FORENSIC INTERVIEWING\r\nDouglas contends the trial court erred in finding forensic interviewing is a field of expertise.Â  We commence our unprecedented and neoteric juridical journey in analyzing this novel issue.\r\nA.Â  Qualification of Expert Witness\r\nThe qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony are matters within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506&nbsp;(2005); State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551&nbsp;(1990); State v. Harris, 318 S.C. 178, 456 S.E.2d 433 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Prince v. Associated Petroleum Carriers, 262 S.C. 358, 365, 204 S.E.2d 575, 579&nbsp;(1974) (â€œWhether a witness has qualified as an expert, and whether his opinion is admissible on a fact in issue, are matters resting largely in the discretion of the trial judge.â€).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to admit expert testimony will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488 (2004); Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176&nbsp;(2002); State v. Grubbs,&nbsp;353 S.C. 374, 577 S.E.2d 493&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003); State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 495 S.E.2d 463&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997); see also Jenkins v. E. L. Long Motor Lines, Inc.,&nbsp;233 S.C. 87, 94, 103 S.E.2d 523, 527&nbsp;(1958) (â€œIt was for the trial [c]ourt to say whether the inquiry was one upon which expert testimony was proper, and its ruling thereon will not be disturbed unless its [sic] appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.â€).\r\nAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509; Renney v.

Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 550, 99 S.E.2d 391, 393-94&nbsp;(1957) (â€œâ€˜[E]rror at lawâ€™ exists: (1) when the circuit judge, in issuing [the order], was controlled by some error of law . . . or (2) where the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, considerations, is without adequate evidentiary support.â€); McSween v. Windham, 77 S.C. 223, 226, 57 S.E. 847, 848&nbsp;(1907) (â€œ[T]he determination of the court will not be interfered with, unless there is an abuse of discretion, or unless the exercise of discretion was controlled by some error of law.â€).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an\r\nabuse of discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509; Grubbs, 353 S.C. at 379, 577 S.E.2d at 496; Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 558 S.E.2d 921&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).\r\nTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.Â  Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., Op. No. 26073 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 28, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 46 at 33); Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509; Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903&nbsp;(1997); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  To show prejudice, there must be a reasonable probability that the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.\r\nThe test for qualification of an expert is a relative one that is dependent on the particular witnessâ€™s reference to the subject.Â  Wilson v. Rivers, 357 S.C. 447, 593 S.E.2d 603 (2004).Â  Rule 702, SCRE, articulates guidelines for the admissibility of expert testimony.Â  Rule 702 provides: â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  Rule 702, SCRE.Â  There is no abuse of discretion as long as the witness has acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.Â  State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 495 S.E.2d 463&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997); State v. Goode, 305 S.C. 176, 406 S.E.2d 391 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  For a court to find a witness competent to testify as an expert, the witness must be better qualified than the fact finder to form an opinion on the particular subject of the testimony.Â  Ellis, 358 S.C. at 525, 595 S.E.2d at 825; Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176&nbsp;(2002); Crawford v. Henderson, 356 S.C. 389, 589 S.E.2d 204&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003); see also Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598&nbsp;(1997) (â€œTo be considered competent to testify as an expert, â€˜a witness must have acquired by reason of study or experience or both such knowledge and skill in a profession or science that he is better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of his testimony.â€™â€).Â  An expert is not limited to any class of persons acting professionally.Â  Gooding, 326 S.C. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598; Thomas Sand Co. v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 563 S.E.2d 109 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  There is no exact requirement concerning how knowledge or skill must be acquired.Â  Honea v. Prior, 295 S.C. 526, 369 S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThe party offering the expert has the burden of showing the witness possesses the necessary learning, skill, or practical experience to enable the witness to give opinion testimony.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689&nbsp;(1996); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859&nbsp;(1993); Henry, 329 S.C. at 274, 495 S.E.2d at 466.Â  Generally, however, defects in the amount and quality of the expertâ€™s education or experience go to the weight to be accorded the expertâ€™s testimony and not to its admissibility.Â  Id.; see also Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 580, 560 S.E.2d 624, 629 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny defect in the education or experience of an expert affects the weight and not the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony.â€).\r\nThe admissibility of scientific evidence is dependent on whether the expert relied on scientifically and professionally established techniques.Â  State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979).Â  This standard is designed to prevent the fact finders from being misled by the aura of infallibility surrounding unproven scientific methods.Â  State v. Morgan, 326 S.C. 503, 485 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, not all expert testimony is subject to a Jones challenge.Â  State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369 (1991).Â  â€œIf the expertâ€™s opinion does not fall within Jones, questions about the reliability of an expertâ€™s methods go only to the weight, but not admissibility, of the testimony.â€Â  Morgan, 326 S.C. at 513, 485 S.E.2d at 118.Â  For instance, this includes the testimony of behavioral science experts.Â  Id. at 513, 485 S.E.2d at 118 (finding the Jones analysis was not applicable to the type of behavioral science testimony at issue in that case).Â  In finding that expert testimony on eyewitness reliability was found admissible, the supreme court in Whaley rejected the necessity of a Jones analysis for that type of evidence to show that the field was a recognized area of expertise:\r\n\r\nThe admissibility of scientific evidence depends upon â€œthe degree to which the trier of fact must accept, on faith, scientific hypotheses not\r\ncapable of proof or disproof in court and not even generally accepted outside the courtroom.â€Â  State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979) (emphasis added). Dr. Coleâ€™s testimony, however, is distinguishable from â€œscientificâ€ evidence, such as DNA test results, blood spatter interpretation, and bite mark comparisons. An eyewitness identification witness gives expert opinion evidence similar to the type given by doctors or psychiatrists. Where the witness is a qualified psychologist who simply explains how certain aspects of every day experience shown by the record can affect human perception and memory, and through them, the accuracy of eyewitness identification, we see no reason to require a greater foundation.Â  People v. McDonald, 690 P.2d 709 (1984).Â  Consequently, we are not persuaded that this type of testimony is required to meet the Jones test.\r\n\r\nWhaley, 305 S.C. at 142, 406 S.E.2d at 371-72 (emphasis in original).\r\nB.Â  Recognized Areas of Expertise in South Carolina\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes a veritable plethora of areas in which an expert â€œhas acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.â€Â  State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 273, 495 S.E.2d 463, 466&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997); see, e.g., Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506&nbsp;(2005) (upholding the South Carolina Court of Appealsâ€™ decision that a physicianâ€™s lack of board certification in a specialized area goes to his weight and credibility, and not his qualification as an expert); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (reversing the decision of the trial court disallowing the expert affidavit of a law school professor that defendant law firm had an attorney-client relationship with plaintiff); Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 574 S.E.2d 215&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (affirming the admission of the expert opinion of a medical doctor that if defendant had diagnosed decedentâ€™s cancer earlier, cancer would have been more curable); Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 558 S.E.2d 921&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (finding a neuropsychologist qualified to offer his opinion of the cause and extent of plaintiffâ€™s injuries despite his not being a medical doctor); Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc.,&nbsp;329 S.C. 448, 494 S.E.2d 835&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (holding a licensed professional engineer may offer his opinion that a log skidder was defectively designed because it allowed debris into the throttle chamber, which caused the throttle to stick).\r\nSouth Carolina appellate courts recognize the significance of expert testimony to assist or guide the trier of fact in criminal cases.Â  See, e.g., State v. Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 547 S.E.2d 490&nbsp;(2001) (clarifying that while police officer may testify as expert in crime scene processing and fingerprint identification, he may not testify to ultimate issue as to whether defendant acted in self-defense); State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689&nbsp;(1996) (upholding trial courtâ€™s decision to allow forensic pathologist to testify, during sentencing, about the amount of pain victim suffered); State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369&nbsp;(1991) (finding eyewitness identification expert qualified); State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551&nbsp;(1990) (allowing expert in blood spatter interpretation to testify); State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d 839&nbsp;(1989) (qualifying a bloodhound handler as an expert witness).\r\nMore specifically, South Carolina courts allow the testimony of experts evaluating victims in sexual abuse cases.Â  In State v. Schumpert, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying a mental health counselor to testify about rape trauma syndrome.Â  Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859&nbsp;(1993).Â  The Court of Appeals, in State v. Weaverling, determined the trial court properly qualified a social worker as an expert in the field of victims of sexual abuse.Â  Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  Similarly, this court allowed the testimony of a mental health counselor in the field of evaluation and treatment of sexually abused children and posttraumatic stress.Â  See State v. Morgan, 326 S.C. 503, 485 S.E.2d 112&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).\r\nC.Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\nIn Mooneyham v. State, 915 So. 2d 1102 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), the Court of Appeals of Mississippi affirmed the trial courtâ€™s qualification of a witness in the field of forensic interviewing:\r\n\r\nCarol Langendoen testified at trial that she had completed a forty-hour training course that was nationally recognized and accepted in the field of â€œFinding Words.â€ The purpose of the course was to train social workers how to conduct forensic interviews of children suspected of having been sexually or physically abused, or who have witnessed a violent crime. The â€œFinding Wordsâ€ protocol is designed to help interviewers to interview child witnesses in such a way as to avoid suggesting facts or testimony to the child. Langendoen stated that she had performed 134 interviews on children, and had completed 126 training hours in forensic interviewing, and some 215 hours in training for child abuse cases generally. Langendoen further testified that she had attended over 340 hours of continuing education in the field of child abuse, and in forensic interviewing specifically.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . We . . . find that there was a credible basis for accepting Langendoen as an expert in the area of forensic interviewing. The admission of Langendoenâ€™s testimony was within the sound discretion of the trial court, and no abuse of that discretion is evident.\r\n\r\nId. at 1104.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Georgia, in In re A.H., 578 S.E.2d 247 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003), addressed the RATAC method of forensic interviewing:\r\n\r\nA.H. also asserts that the investigator did not have proper training in handling a child interview appropriately and that he did not employ appropriate techniques. This assertion lacks merit. The investigatorâ€™s primary duty was to investigate child abuse complaints, and he had taken specialized training courses in interviewing children in sex abuse cases. He conducted the interview in a specialized, â€œchild-friendlyâ€ environment. Only he and the child were present, and he employed a known method for interviewing child victims, the RATAC method, described by a witness in Baker v. State, 252 Ga. App. 238, 239, 555 S.E.2d 899 (2001).Â  This acronym stands for gaining rapport with the child, anatomy identification, touch inquiry, abuse scenario, and closure.Â  Id.Â  Although the investigator may not have been familiar with the specifics of the named protocol, he followed each of the steps in this case. After establishing initial rapport with the child victim, he used drawings to determine anatomy identification, and he questioned the child about good touch and bad touch. He then inquired specifically about the alleged abuse, before ending the interview. Reviewing all the factors to be considered, we conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the videotape or considering the childâ€™s testimony.\r\n\r\nId. at 250 (emphasis added).\r\nThereafter, the Court of Appeals of Georgia found a psychologist was qualified as an expert in the area of forensic interviewing of child sexual abuse victims:\r\n\r\nMaddox charges his trial attorney with ineffective assistance in\r\nfailing to object to testimony by the psychologist who conducted the pretrial interview of T.M.Â  Maddox argues that certain testimony given by the psychologist amounted to improper bolstering of T.M.â€™s credibility. There is no merit in this argument. The psychologist was qualified as an expert in the field of conducting forensic interviews of children in sexual abuse cases. She testified to her training and experience, which included conducting hundreds of such interviews. After the videotape of the interview was played to the jury, the prosecutor commented that T.M. had not given any specific dates on which events had happened, and the psychologist was asked whether that was uncommon. The psychologist responded that it is more uncommon for a child (or for an adult) to be able to specify incident dates where, as here, there has been a recurrence of events over a prolonged period.\r\nImproper bolstering occurs when an expert witness is allowed to give his or her opinion as to whether the complaining witness is telling the truth, because that is an ultimate issue of fact and the inference to be drawn is not beyond the ken of the average juror. Here, the witness testified on the basis of her experience in forensic interviewing as to the ability of interviewees to recall certain things in certain situations. That was in no way a comment on an ultimate issue of fact. And the court was authorized to find that the conclusion drawn by the expert was beyond the ken of the jurors.\r\nTherefore, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object.\r\n\r\nMaddox v. State, 622 S.E.2d 80, 82 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005).\r\nIn State v. Hilton, 764 So. 2d 1027 (La. Ct. App. 2000), the Court of Appeal of Louisiana inculcated:\r\n\r\nCheri Staten, the director of the Jefferson Parish Childrenâ€™s Advocacy Center, was qualified as an expert in forensic interviewing in the area of child sexual abuse. Â She testified that she does forensic interviews for Washington Parish and explained that a forensic interview is an interview with children used to gather information, not to conduct therapy. The children are given an opportunity to talk and are asked general questions, without discussing the allegations of the abuse. Â She also indicated that she wears an earpiece so that law enforcement officers can speak to her while they monitor the interview.\r\n\r\nId. at 1033; cf. Lena v. State, 901 So. 2d 227, 233 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe record does not demonstrate the existence of a recognized field of expertise in forensic interviewing, such that a person can be qualified as an expert in it. It was . . . perfectly permissible to present Ms. Silvermanâ€™s educational background and work experience, but she should not have been presented to the jury as an expert in forensic interviewing.â€). \r\nD.Â  The Extant Factual Record\r\nIn the instant case, the State called Herod to testify.Â  Herod explained she began working in the victimâ€™s assistance office for the Sumter County Sheriffâ€™s Department in 1998.Â  She conducts forensic interviews of child victims and follows the victims through the court process.Â  She declared:\r\n\r\nA forensic interview is a term that is used when interviewing children and what it means is that itâ€™s a clean interview.Â  Itâ€™s an interview where you donâ€™t ask any leading questions or you donâ€™t assume anything. We have . . . a forensic interviewing room where we bring the children in and conduct the interviews there and I do this for the sheriffâ€™s office and then I report my findings and make any recommendations that I have based on my interview and turn my findings over to the investigator that has been assigned that case.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . Currently we conduct our interviews, I use the RATAC method, which there has been a movement nationwide because different agencies were using or doing different methods to interview children.Â  The National Center for . . . Prosecution [of Child Abuse] wanted to, came up with a plan . . . [t]o standardize the interviewing process.\r\n\r\nWhen Herod began to describe her training, Douglas objected and argued that Herodâ€™s training was not relevant.Â  The trial court pointed out the State was eliciting â€œbackground information for purposes of qualifying the witness as an expertâ€ and overruled the objection.\r\nHerod articulated:\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was actually the second state that went through that training and I was involved with the first training class that happened in South Carolina, the finding words class and it taught the RATAC method and I graduated from that class in March of 2001 and have actually been, they have offered an advanced class for the graduates of that first class and I graduated from that in June of 2003 and the RATAC method that they teach is standard operating procedure for our office at this time.\r\n\r\nThe State offered Herod â€œas an expert witness in the field of forensic interview.â€Â  Douglas objected that â€œthere is [no] such field of expertise.â€Â  The trial court excused the jury and held a hearing on the qualification of Herod.\r\nDuring the in camera hearing, Herod stated she had interviewed child victims â€œof similar types of cases, including criminal sexual conduct and lewd act,â€ hundreds of times.Â  When asked if she had testified in court before, Herod responded: â€œIâ€™ve testified in court many times, Iâ€™ve testified as an expert witness and been qualified by different courts as an expert witness in interviewing child sexual assault victims in [the circuit court] as well a[s] court[s] in federal jurisdiction and several times in family court.â€Â  She explained the forensic interviewing method is widely used in law enforcement and is nationally recognized for interviewing child victims of sexual crimes.Â  Herod received a week-long training in the RATAC method of forensic interviewing before she interviewed the victim.Â  She received a second week of advanced training after she interviewed the victim.\r\nHerod described the RATAC method she used to interview child abuse victims:\r\n\r\nI introduce myself to the child after being briefed by the investigator requesting the interview, bring her into the interview room, in the interview room itâ€™s just me and the person that Iâ€™m interviewing present in that room, but there is a two way mirror and a sound system where the investigator can listen to the interview, that way I can get any input that I need from them or find out any more specific details that they need and there will be a point that I do that.Â  The child and I then engage in the interview and . . . we use the RATAC method, and RATAC is an acronym for each stage of the interview.Â  The â€œRâ€ being the rapport stage where I build rapport with the child and talk about school, family, whatever can make that child feel comfortable, also during that stage I go over the rules of the interview which is simply we talk about telling the truth, . . . and I explain to her my role and who I work for and what I do and we talk about that this is a safe place and the importance of telling the truth and if the child agrees to those ground rules, we go on with the interview.Â  After the rapport stage, and where we name family members and that type of stuff and I use drawings during that, in this case, I drew a couple of houses I think, because she was explaining her family to me and we put family members in that house, the next stage is the anatomy identification and we use a drawing of an age appropriate, race appropriate boy and girl and that allows me to do a couple of things to see if she can differentiate gender, to see if she can name different body parts, and we name body parts to include eyes, nose and that allows me to know what the child calls, itâ€™s not a teaching, the interview process is not a teaching process, Iâ€™m not teaching her anything, and so I will refer to body parts by the same name that she does.Â  After we identify the body parts on the anatomy identification section of the interview.Â  The â€œTâ€ is for the touch inquiry and by that we start opening up the dialogue about tell me some touches that you like, different responses will come from different children, some children like to be tickled, some children like to have their back scratched, some like hugs, and then after that I go into are there any places on your body that would not be ok for someone to touch and the child at that time will tell me parts of her body, the off-limit parts, the private parts or whatever.Â  Then I will ask or I will transition into the part of the interview, has there ever been a time where anyone, keeping a true forensic interview, if she discloses at that point, that there has been touching by anyone, we go into the second â€œAâ€ of the RATAC procedure which is the abuse scenario and that allows a child to disclose to me what has happened to her.Â  After we have covered that, with as much detail as that child can give, with as many open ended questions from me, non-assuming questions from me, we end the interview on the â€œCâ€ portion of the interview, which is the closure and at that point we talk about safety issues, that itâ€™s good to tell and I address any concerns that child has about what theyâ€™ve told during that interview and thatâ€™s the basic interview that we do.\r\n\r\nHerod stated she utilized the RATAC method in her forensic interview of the victim.Â  After her interview with the victim, Herod met with Officer McGee and recommended that the victim â€œbe taken for a medical exam at the Durant Center.â€\r\nAfter the State proffered Herodâ€™s proposed testimony, Douglas objected to its admission on the grounds it was â€œhearsay, bolstering, and the prejudicial value outweighs the probative value.â€Â  On cross-examination, Herod admitted she had a high school diploma, did not have a diploma from a university, was not a medical doctor, and the training she received to be certified in the form of interview she specifically used on the victim was one week.Â  When discussing her training, Herod declared:\r\n\r\nI had to have background and experience in interviewing child victims before I would have been accepted to enter into that training.Â  The training itself for the initial course was a one week all day training session which incorporated the background as to the theory behind forensic interviewing and the method and then also a practical session where we actually had to conduct an interview.\r\n\r\nRegarding the training she received, Herod emphasized that she had attended two weeks of courses and â€œhad lots of experience in interviewing children and there have been other courses that [she had] been to dealing with interviewing children.â€\r\nAfter the proffer, the State asserted â€œthe fact of the question is her, basically her opinion that based upon her interview that further medical investigation was necessary.â€Â  Douglas complained that â€œtwo weeks certification does not an expert make in the area of a legal procedure which we feel was created to bolster her testimony in the first place.â€Â  The trial court concluded the evidence was admissible because â€œit will assist the trier of fact to determine a fact in issue and . . . it specifically will assist them in determining if an assault of the nature described by the young lady took place and what she did, what this witness did as a result of her interview.â€Â  The judge determined Herod was â€œqualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training and education.â€\r\nHerod testified in detail in front of the jury as to her qualifications as an expert in forensic interviewing.Â  Herod declared that upon completing the first RATAC training course, she was certified as a forensic interviewer using that method.Â  When questioned about further training, Herod elucidated:\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve been back for follow up courses and advance courses and thereâ€™s a national newsletter that comes out every month that we get and we keep up with the different issues and case law, things that are going on nationwide regarding this interview process.\r\n\r\nThe judge then qualified Herod as an expert in the field of forensic interviewing.\r\nHerod interviewed the victim on February 10, 2003 using the RATAC method.Â  They â€œtalked about a series of events that began in the summer and continued until right before Christmas.â€Â  The State asked: â€œ[B]ased on your interview under the RATAC method, was it your opinion if any follow up was necessary?â€Â  Herod replied: â€œYes sir.Â  It was my opinion that [the victim] needed to go to the Durant Center for a medical exam and that was the recommendation that I made in my report.â€\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Herod had â€œacquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of [her] testimony as would enable [her] to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.â€Â  State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 273, 495 S.E.2d 463, 466&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  Herod had previously been qualified in family court, circuit court and federal court as an expert witness in interviewing child sexual assault victims.Â  She received specialized training on the RATAC method, which is used on a nationwide basis and is nationally recognized for interviewing child victims of sexual crimes.Â  After completing the initial RATAC training course, Herod was certified as a forensic interviewer using that method.Â  Herod receives a monthly national newsletter that informs her of current issues and case law regarding the RATAC method.Â  The trial court had sufficient evidence that forensic interviewing was a recognized field.Â  See State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979); see also In re A.H., 578 S.E.2d 247, 250 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) (rejecting claim that investigator was incompetent to conduct interview of child victim, noting he â€œemployed a known method for interviewing child victims, the RATAC methodâ€).\r\nE.Â  Harmless Error\r\nEven if the trial court had erred, we would hold this error to be harmless.\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998); State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  No definite rule of law governs this finding.Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985).\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. Â In re Harvey, 355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897; State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 613 S.E.2d 760 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Where a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.Â  State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005); Thompson, 352 S.C. at 562, 575 S.E.2d at 83.Â  Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).\r\nGenerally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795.Â  The admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.Â  State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003); State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 247 S.E.2d 334 (1978); State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996) (instructing that error in admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence which was properly admitted).\r\nThe only reasonable inference the jury could have drawn from Herodâ€™s testimony is that she believed the victim told the truth about being sexually assaulted.Â  However, Saunders testified her examination revealed tearing and scarring consistent with past penetration.Â  Douglas has not shown a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by Herodâ€™s testimony.\r\nII.Â  BOLSTERING\r\nDouglas maintains Herodâ€™s testimony impermissibly bolstered the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note the State argues this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Unless an objection is made at the time evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57&nbsp;(1996); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993); Bank v. North Carolina Mut. Life Ins. Co., 186 S.C. 394, 195 S.E. 649&nbsp;(1938).Â  A party must object at the first opportunity to preserve an issue for review.Â  State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811 (1999); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991); State v. Lopez, 352 S.C. 373, 574 S.E.2d 210 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Yet, this rule does not require defense counsel to harass the judge by making continued objections after the trial court has ruled upon the issue.Â  See Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, 426 S.E.2d 756&nbsp;(1993); Long v. Norris &amp; Assocs., Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 538 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App. 2000); State v. Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 509 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1998); State v. McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 462 S.E.2d 882&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nHere, Douglas objected to Herodâ€™s testimony and the trial court held an in camera hearing to qualify the witness.Â  During the hearing, Douglas objected and argued Herodâ€™s testimony improperly bolstered the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  The trial court overruled this objection.Â  When the State moved the court to qualify the witness as an expert before the jury, Douglas renewed his objections. The trial court noted the objections â€œwill run throughout the record.â€Â  Therefore, Douglas properly preserved this issue for our review.\r\nImproper bolstering occurs when an expert witness is allowed to give his or her opinion as to whether the complaining witness is telling the truth, because that is an ultimate issue of fact and the inference to be drawn is not beyond the ken of the average juror.Â  Maddox v. State, 622 S.E.2d 80 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005).\r\nIn State v. Barrett, the trial court allowed a social worker â€œto testify to the details of what [a v]ictim [of sexual abuse] had told her concerning the incident.â€Â  Barrett, 299 S.C. 485, 486, 386 S.E.2d 242, 243&nbsp;(1989).Â  On appeal, defendant argued this testimony impermissibly bolstered the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  The supreme court explicated:\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, when a witness has not been impeached, evidence of prior consistent statements is inadmissible. To this rule is an exception in criminal sexual conduct cases. When the victim testifies, evidence from other witnesses that she complained of the sexual assault is admissible as corroboration of the incident;\r\nhowever, the evidence must be limited to the time and place of the assault, and may not include particulars or details. \r\n\r\nId. at 486-87, 386 S.E.2d at 243 (citations omitted).Â  The court reversed the conviction because the social worker â€œtestified extensively to details of the sexual abuse reported by Victim.â€Â  Id. at 487, 386 S.E.2d at 243.\r\n State v. Jolly, 304 S.C. 34, 402 S.E.2d 895 (Ct. App. 1991), is instructive.Â  In Jolly, a social worker testified only that the victim told her the defendant â€œmessed with her.â€Â  Jolly, 304 S.C. at 36, 402 S.E.2d at 896.Â  The court of appeals distinguished Barrett and held that, because the social worker in Jolly did not provide extensive details of the incident, the testimony did not impermissibly bolster the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  Id. at 39, 402 S.E.2d at 898.\r\nIn the case sub judice, Herodâ€™s testimony is less bolstering than in both Barrett and Jolly.Â  Herod testified only about the time period in which the alleged events occurred, and opined that the victim needed a medical evaluation.Â  Although the jury could infer Herod thought the victim told her the truth about being molested, Herod offered no testimony as to the alleged perpetrator or the particulars of the sexual abuse.Â  Herod did not express her opinion as to whether or not the victim told her the truth during the interview.\r\nMoreover, the testimony was not presented to bolster the victimâ€™s credibility, but as a measure to prevent a defense or argument that the victimâ€™s testimony was the result of police suggestiveness.Â  The RATAC method was developed in response to concerns about child victimsâ€™ testimony being tainted by police suggestiveness, as exemplified by State v. Michaels, 642 A.2d 1372 (N.J. 1994):\r\n\r\n[A] sufficient consensus exists within the academic, professional, and law enforcement communities, confirmed in varying degrees by courts, to warrant the conclusion that the use of coercive or highly suggestive interrogation techniques can create a significant risk that the interrogation itself will distort the childâ€™s recollection of events, thereby undermining the reliability of the statements and subsequent testimony concerning such events.\r\n\r\nId. at 1379.\r\nThe trial court correctly found Herodâ€™s testimony did not impermissibly bolster the testimony of the victim.\r\nIII.Â  RULE 403, SCRE\r\nDouglas alleges the trial court erred in failing to exclude Herodâ€™s testimony â€œbecause its probative value was substantially outweighed by its unduly prejudicial effect.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 403, SCRE, provides:\r\n\r\nAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\r\n\r\nSee also State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146&nbsp;(1991).Â  Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.Â  State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 606 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The determination of prejudice must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 606 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We review a trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.Â  McLeod, 362 S.C. at 81-82, 606 S.E.2d at 220; State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nHere, Douglas argues Herodâ€™s testimony impermissibly bolstered the victimâ€™s testimony and unfairly prejudiced Douglas.Â  Herodâ€™s testimony did not impermissibly bolster the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  Douglas has not offered any â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€ for this court to reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value of Herodâ€™s testimony and its prejudicial effect on Douglasâ€™ case.Â  The trial court properly admitted Herodâ€™s testimony pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE.\r\nIV.Â  VICTIM IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY\r\nDouglas avers the trial court erred in not allowing him to impeach the victim with extrinsic evidence in the form of his motherâ€™s testimony.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87&nbsp;(2002); State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 610 S.E.2d 823&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  An abuse of discretion arises from an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  State v. Irick, 344 S.C. 460, 545 S.E.2d 282 (2001); State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 577 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  See Rule 103, SCRE; State v. Crocker, 366 S.C. 394, 621 S.E.2d 890 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 613 S.E.2d 381 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 606 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Error without prejudice does not warrant reversal.Â  State v. King, Op. No. 4045 (S.C. Ct. App. filed November 21, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 44 at 35).\r\n\r\nRule 613(b), SCRE, reads:\r\nÂ \r\n  Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Â If a witness\r\ndoes not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the victim admitted to lying in the past, and generally admitted lying to Amelia Douglas, Douglasâ€™ mother.Â  However, on cross-examination, defense counsel asked: â€œDo you remember not telling the truth to Ms. Douglas before right?â€Â  The victim replied: â€œI told the truth to her.â€Â  Defense counsel inquired: â€œDo you remember telling her that you didnâ€™t cut a cord that you cut?â€Â  The victim responded: â€œNo.â€&nbsp;\r\nDuring the presentation of his case, Douglas called Amelia to testify.Â  When Amelia began testifying as to an incident in which the victim lied about cutting a wire in the house but later admitted to cutting the wire, the State objected.Â  The trial court sustained the objection, but allowed Douglas to proffer Ameliaâ€™s testimony.Â  The court ruled the testimony was not admissible as a prior inconsistent statement of a witness under Rule 613(b), SCRE, because the alleged prior statement was not inconsistent with the victimâ€™s testimony.Â  Additionally, the trial court held the statement inadmissible under Rule 608(b), SCRE, which deals with specific instances of conduct.Â  In his brief on appeal, Douglas argues the victimâ€™s â€œtrial testimony was inconsistent with . . . her prior inconsistent admission of lying to [Amelia].â€\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Ameliaâ€™s testimony about what the victim told her was consistent with the victimâ€™s testimony at trial that she had lied to Amelia in the past.Â  The judge properly found this was â€œnot a matter under [Rule 613(b)] where it is extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of a witness because the witness, and that is the victim in this case, did not make an inconsistent statement, she actually admitted . . . she did . . . not tell the truth sometimes.â€Â  Further, the judge did not err in excluding the testimony pursuant to Rule 608(b).\r\nAssuming arguendo the trial judge erred in prohibiting Ameliaâ€™s testimony, we find such error was harmless.\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 613 S.E.2d 760 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result. State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Where a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996); State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIf it did not contribute to the verdict obtained, then error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Fletcher, 363 S.C. at 248, 609 S.E.2d at 586; Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of\r\nthe trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached. State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795.&nbsp;\r\nEven if the judge erred in excluding this testimony, the error is harmless because the victim admitted to lying to Amelia in the past.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that FORENSIC INTERVIEWING is a recognized field of expertise.Â  We rule that Herod is qualified as an expert in forensic interviewing by virtue of her knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education. Â The judge did not err in allowing Herod to testify as an expert witness in the area of forensic interviewing.Â Â Â  Herodâ€™s testimony satisfied Rule 702, SCRE.Â  The judge properly concluded Herodâ€™s testimony would explain to the jury Herodâ€™s role in the process and Herodâ€™s decision to recommend a medical examination. \r\nWe find the testimony of Amelia does not meet the test of the victim impeachment rule in South Carolina.Â  The trial court correctly exercised discretion in excluding Ameliaâ€™s testimony.\r\nAccordingly, Douglasâ€™ conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4076","title":"State v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Craig Middleton was convicted of second-degree burglary and safecracking and sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years.Â  Middleton appeals the burglary conviction, arguing he was entitled to a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn a Saturday night in April 2003, Officer Robert Bilyard, a police officer for the Town of Port Royal, responded to a telephone call about a burglar alarm at Henry J. Lee Distributors.[2]Â  Bilyard and another officer arrived at the scene and met Senis Hodges, a Lee employee.Â  The door to the main building was unlocked, and there was no sign of forced entry.Â  The alarms and telephones in the main office were inoperable, and the bolts that secured the office safe to the floor had been cut.Â  Hodges testified the safe contained a very large sum of money including over $100,000 in proceeds from sales at a golf tournament.Â  The contents of the safe were undisturbed, except pieces of the bolts that had been cut were pushed up into the safe.Â  \r\nAs Bilyard and Hodges left the building, they noticed the metal cover to the crawl space entrance was not in place.Â  The crawl space does not provide direct access to the building.Â  Officer Ronald Wekenmann, also of the Town of Port Royal police department, arrived on the scene and, as he approached the entrance to the crawl space, he saw Middleton hiding underneath the building near the crawl space trapdoor.Â  Wekenmann apprehended Middleton, who was wearing torn latex gloves and was carrying a ski mask.Â  \r\nAnother police officer investigated the crawl space and found numerous cut wires, torn insulation, a piece of a safe bolt, and a blue backpack containing latex gloves, wire cutters, and numerous other tools.Â  Outside the crawl space, the officer found a flashlight, keys, and a cell phone.Â  After being advised of his rights, Middleton stated:Â  â€œYou caught me; I did what I did and thatâ€™s all I have to say.â€Â  \r\nAt trial, Middleton moved for a directed verdict on the burglary charge arguing there was no evidence of entry into the office building.Â  The State argued the crawl space was part of the curtilage of the building.Â  The trial court found there was circumstantial evidence of a break-in into the office, the crawl space was part of the building, and Middleton was not entitled to a directed verdict on the burglary charge.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a directed verdict motion, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State to determine if any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence exists that reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â  The court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMiddleton argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict on the burglary charge because the crawl space underneath the building does not meet the statutory definition of a â€œbuildingâ€ for purposes of the burglary statute.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nMiddleton was charged with second-degree burglary in violation of South Carolina Code section 16-11-312(B), which provides in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n(B)Â  A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree if the person enters a building without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, and either:\r\n  \r\n. . .\r\n  \r\n(3) Â The entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n\r\nS.C.Â  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312 (B) (2003).Â  As relates to the burglary statute, a building is defined in section 16-11-310: \r\n\r\nFor purposes of Â§Â§ 16-11-311 through 16-11-313:\r\n  \r\n(1) â€œBuildingâ€ means any structure, vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft:\r\n(a) Where any person lodges or lives; or\r\n(b) Where people assemble for purposes of business, government, education, religion, entertainment, public transportation, or public use or where goods are stored.Â  Where a building consists of two or more units separately occupied or secured, each unit is deemed both a separate building in itself and a part of the main building. . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310 (2003).Â  A â€œbuildingâ€ is a â€œ[s]tructure designed for habitation, shelter, storage . . . and the like.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 194 (6th ed. 1990).Â  \r\nBecause we find no South Carolina case directly on point, we look to general rules of statutory construction.Â  Criminal statutes must be strictly construed against the State.Â  State v. Myers, 313 S.C. 391, 393, 438 S.E.2d 236, 237 (1993).Â  However, words in a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning.Â  Id.Â  Our courts take a common sense approach in defining the terms associated with the burglary statutes.Â  See id. (â€œ[B]y including â€˜buildingâ€™ the definition of â€˜dwelling houseâ€™ is broad enough to include a boat in which a person lodges.â€).Â  See also State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 446, 567 S.E.2d 244, 246 (2002) (finding a screened porch meets the statutory definition of a dwelling).Â  Applying a common sense meaning to the words used to define a â€œbuildingâ€ for purposes of the burglary statute leads to the inescapable conclusion that the crawl space is a part of the main building and therefore fits within the statutory definition of a building.Â  \r\nWe find support from other jurisdictions that have found similar spaces constitute a building.Â  See Garrett v. State, 578 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a shelter with a contiguous wall used for storage for the main building is part of the main building); State v. Brower, 104 N.W. 284, 285 (Iowa 1905) (holding the word â€œbuilding,â€ within its accepted and legal signification, includes the cellar or basement); State v. Couch, 720 P.2d 1387, 1389-90 (Wash. Ct. App. 1986) (upholding conviction of second-degree burglary of building; finding basement of building part of the building as it was enclosed, associated with the building, and used in connection with the buildingâ€”statute, however, provided broader definition of building).Â  See generally Ghent, Jeffrey F., Annotation, What is â€œBuildingâ€ or â€œHouseâ€ Within Burglary or Breaking and Entering Statute, 68 A.L.R. 4th 425 (1989&nbsp;&amp; Supp. 2004).\r\nIn this case, the crawl space was underneath the office building and enclosed but for an opening concealed with a metal cover.Â  Under the facts of this case, we find the crawl space to be an integral part of the structure of the building and the trial court did not err in denying Middletonâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the conviction isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lee is a beer distributor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4077","title":"Love v.

Burroughs, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Ann B. Love (Wife) appeals a family court order terminating her former husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMiller L. Love, Jr., (Husband) and Wife married in Florence, South Carolina, on June 3, 1962.Â  In January 1990, Wife was granted a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  The final divorce order incorporated a separation agreement entered into voluntarily by the parties.Â  The agreement addressed all of the major issues arising from the marriage, including, but not limited to, custody, visitation, spousal support, and the division of marital property.Â  \r\nThe parties agreed Husband would pay Wife $1,100 per month in alimony, an obligation which â€œshall end . . . upon the Wifeâ€™s remarriage or death, whichever occurs first.â€Â  With the exception of the provisions concerning the division of marital property, the agreement provides:\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this Agreement . . . shall be subject to the approval, confirmation and adoption of the Court, such that it becomes the Order of the Court and enforceable and modifiable as such.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Wife petitioned the family court for a modification of the alimony agreement.Â  Prior to a hearing on the matter, the parties agreed Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation would increase by $600 per month, making the total monthly payment $1,700.\r\nIn 1995, Wife began dating Otis Goodwin, who had recently divorced his first wife.Â  Approximately a year and a half later, Wife moved in with Goodwin into the home they share today.Â  Goodwin testified that Wife pays him $200 per week for rent and her share of the utilities.Â  Over the course of their relationship, Goodwin loaned Wife $8,000, which was repaid, and a partially outstanding business loan of $25,000.Â  Wife is also a cardholder on Goodwinâ€™s American Express Account, although each pays his or her own portion of the credit card bill.Â  Mr. Goodwin has authority to write checks on Wifeâ€™s businessâ€™s checking account.Â  In 1997, Goodwin transferred to Wife a parcel of land in Surfside, South Carolina worth approximately $40,000 for the consideration of â€œ$5.00 love and affection.â€Â  Goodwin routinely attends holiday celebrations and special occasions with Wifeâ€™s family and Wifeâ€™s grandchildren refer to him with terms of affection such as â€œGrandpa O.â€Â  Although both Wife and Goodwin openly admit the romantic nature of their relationship, they are not formally married, nor do they express plans of marrying in the future.\r\nIn 2003, Husband filed the present action, petitioning the court for further modification of the alimony agreement.Â  Specifically, Husband alleged Wifeâ€™s amorous relationship and seven-year cohabitation with Goodwin constituted grounds for termination, or at least a substantial reduction, of his alimony obligation.Â  Husband averred that 2002 amendments to South Carolina Code Section 20-3-130(B)(1) (1976) prescribed this modification.Â  Alternatively, he argued Wifeâ€™s relationship was tantamount to marriage, warranting a termination of alimony as a significant change in circumstances under the common law of alimony.\r\nThe family court agreed with Husband and ordered the termination of alimony pursuant to both the recent statutory amendments and a determination that Wifeâ€™s relationship is â€œtantamount to marriage.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We remain mindful that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWife argues the family court erred in terminating Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation because the family court lacked the authority to do so under both the law of this state and the terms of the agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 306 S.E.2d 624 (1983), our supreme court perspicuously held that the family court has the authority to modify alimony agreements â€œunless the agreement unambiguously denies the court jurisdictionâ€ to do so.Â  Id. at 352-53, 306 S.E.2d at 627; see also Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500-01, 602 S.E.2d 96, 98 (Ct. App. 2004); Stoddard v. Riddle, 362 S.C. 266, 268, 607 S.E.2d 97, 98 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Not only does the present agreement fail to expressly deny the family court this authority, it definitively grants the court such in stating that its terms â€œshall be subject to the approval, confirmation and adoption of the Court, such that it becomes the Order of the Court and enforceable and modifiable as such.â€Â  Accordingly, the family court had authority to modify the alimony in the present case.\r\nWife subtly concedes this point, a position due, no doubt, to the fact that she herself petitioned the court for an increase in alimony in 1995.Â  Wife, however, would have us somehow distinguish between the power to modify alimony and the power to terminate alimony.Â  We draw no such distinction.Â  Parties to a separation agreement may either agree to make alimony unmodifiable, or leave the issue within the traditional oversight of the family court.Â  See Moseley, 279 S.C. at 352-53, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Should the parties agree to the latter, the family court may modify alimony to the same extent permissible in court-awarded alimony, a scope of authority which certainly includes the power to terminate payments based on substantial changes in the partiesâ€™ circumstances.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1976); Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œChanged conditions may warrant a modification or termination of alimony.â€).\r\nHaving concluded the family court possessed the authority to terminate alimony, we move to the issue of whether this authority was properly exercised in the present case.Â  As a ground for termination, the family court concluded Wifeâ€™s relationship with Goodwin was tantamount to marriage, constituting a substantial change in circumstances which warranted alimony termination.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s termination of alimony on this ground.[1]\r\nâ€œThe purpose of alimony is to provide the ex-spouse a substitute for the support which was incident to the former marital relationship.â€Â  Croom v. Croom, 305 S.C. 158, 160, 406 S.E.2d 381, 382 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œLiving with another, whether it is with a live-in lover, a relative, or a platonic housemate, changes [a personâ€™s] circumstances and alters [his or] her required financial support.â€Â  Vance v. Vance, 287 S.C. 615, 618, 340 S.E.2d 554, 555 (Ct. App. 1986).Â Â Â  Because the State has â€œa compelling interest in promoting marriage and discouraging meretricious relationships,â€ a rule allowing alimony to continue when the supported spouse cohabits without marrying is â€œillogical and offensive to public policy.â€Â  Croom, 305 S.C. at 160, 406 S.E.2d at 382.Â  Accordingly, courts will treat the relationship between a supported spouse and a third party as â€œtantamount to marriageâ€ and terminate alimony when the two cohabitate for an extended period of time and some degree of economic reliance between them is established.Â  See, e.g., Bryson, 347 S.C. at 225, 553 S.E.2d at 496; Vance, 287 S.C. at 617-18, 340 S.E.2d at 555.\r\nSuch a relationship is certainly established in the case at bar.Â  Wife and Goodwin have cohabitated for over seven years.Â  Despite their assertions to the contrary, the record reflects the pair share a substantial amount of expenses, be it in the form of loans, reduced rent, or gifts.Â  The record also reflects the romantic nature of the partyâ€™s relationship and the unmistakable connection between Goodwin and Wifeâ€™s family.Â  See Bryson, 347 S.C. at 226, 553 S.E.2d at 496 (considering the bonds between cohabitating partner and the alimony recipientâ€™s family in determining whether relationship was tantamount to marriage).Â  We therefore affirm the family courtâ€™s conclusion that Wife and Goodwin are in relationship that is tantamount to marriage.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order terminating Wifeâ€™s alimony is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.[2]\r\n STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because we affirm the family court on the ground Wifeâ€™s relationship constitutes a change of circumstance warranting alimony termination, we need not address the statutory grounds for the family courtâ€™s termination of alimony.Â  SeeÂ  Iâ€™On , L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000) (holding an appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the record on appeal).\r\n[2] Because we affirm the result reached by the family court, we likewise affirm the family courtâ€™s determination that neither party is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  As Wife is clearly not the prevailing party in this action, the family court properly denied her request for fees.Â  See E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992) (holding that the result obtained in litigation is an important factor in the consideration of whether to grant a party attorneyâ€™s fees).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4078","title":"Stokes v.

Stokesâ€™s estate, appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Spartanburg Regional Medical Center (the Hospital).Â  Appellant argues the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could draw a negative inference from the Hospitalâ€™s failure to preserve critical pieces of medical evidence.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 10, 1998, Jennings Stokes, age seventy-seven, underwent surgery to remove his thyroid and lymph nodes, which were cancerous.Â  Dr. Hull performed the surgery at the Hospital.Â  No complications arose during the surgery, and according to Dr. Hull, Stokesâ€™s prognosis was very good.Â  \r\nAfter surgery, Stokes was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (recovery room), where he remained for two hours.Â  While there, he received oxygen through a mask, and nurses monitored his oxygen saturation levels with a device called a pulse oximeter. During this two-hour stay in the recovery room, Stokes received five doses of morphine for pain, and nurses called Dr. Hull two times because of bloody drainage coming from the neck incision.Â  \r\nFrom the recovery room, Stokes was transferred to the third floor of the Hospital, which is designated â€œpediatrics.â€[1]Â  While on the third floor, Stokes no longer had an oxygen mask and was not being monitored with a pulse oximeter.Â  Stokes arrived on the third floor at 6:45 p.m., and according to the nurseâ€™s notes, by 7:30 p.m., his neck was â€œswollenâ€ and his wound dressing was â€œsaturated.â€ Thirty minutes later, Stokes complained of pain and received Demerol combined with Phenergan, a narcotic medication. According to the nurse, Stokes began having â€œdifficulty breathingâ€ at 8:30 p.m., and at 8:55 p.m., his breathing stopped.Â  Five minutes later, a â€œcodeâ€ was initiated. \r\nDuring the code, a nurse anesthetist tried to intubate Stokes in order to provide him with oxygen, but the intubation was unsuccessful.Â  The nurse anesthetist called the anesthesiologist for help.Â  Dr. Cochran, a partner of Dr. Hullâ€™s, was also notified of the code, and took charge of the resuscitation.Â  At 9:21 p.m., Dr. Long, the anesthesiologist, arrived and successfully intubated Stokes.Â  Despite the intubation, Stokes could not be revived.Â  Dr. Cochran signed the death certificate, stating the cause of death was â€œrespiratory failure.â€Â  \r\nStokesâ€™s daughter-in-law, Ann, is a registered nurse and has worked in the Hospitalâ€™s recovery room for fifteen years.Â  Ann was by Stokesâ€™s side while he was in the recovery room, and she stayed with him even when he was transferred to the third floor.Â  While Ann was there, other nurses were charged with caring for Stokes, but Ann monitored him as well. \r\nAfter Stokes died, his son, Terry, served as the personal representative of Stokesâ€™s estate, and it was in this capacity that Terry (hereinafter Appellant) brought a survivorship action and wrongful death action against the Hospital and other defendants who are not parties to this appeal.Â  At trial, Appellant and the Hospital disputed the cause of Stokesâ€™s death.Â  \r\nAppellant argued that Stokes died from a lack of oxygen, which could have been prevented if the Hospitalâ€™s staff had not deviated from the standard of care for a patient recovering from a thyroidectomy.Â  According to Appellantâ€™s experts, a well-known complication of this type of surgery is airway obstruction caused by the swelling of soft tissue in the patientâ€™s neck or postoperative bleeding, which can collect in one area and form a hematoma. A hematoma is especially dangerous after surgery to the neck because it can clog a patientâ€™s windpipe. To decrease the chance of a patientâ€™s airway being obstructed, Appellantâ€™s experts testified the patient should be on supplemental oxygen and vigilantly monitored for signs of respiratory distress.Â  The experts further opined that a tracheotomy procedure kit should be kept next to the patientâ€™s bed in the event the patientâ€™s airway becomes so obstructed that an intubation tube cannot be placed into the patientâ€™s throat and a â€œsurgical airwayâ€ must be created.Â  It was the Appellantâ€™s position that the Hospital deviated from the standard of care by transferring Stokes to the third floor, where the nurse in charge had never cared for a thyroidectomy patient before and was not instructed to continue administering oxygen to Stokes.Â  The Appellant further argued Stokesâ€™s third floor placement was unacceptable because there was no tracheotomy kit at his bedside.Â  \r\nThe Hospital argued that Stokes died from a sudden and unexpected event, most probably a heart attack.Â  It relied heavily on Ann, who testified as both an eyewitness and an expert witness.Â  According to Ann, Stokes showed no signs of respiratory distress, though his respirations did slow down after he received pain medication.Â  Ann found this reaction normal, but out of an abundance of caution, she stepped outside the room and asked for a pulse oximeter to measure his oxygen saturation level. She testified she left the room for less than a minute, and when she returned, she found Stokesâ€™s condition had deteriorated rapidly.Â  His breathing was shallow, his pulse weak, and he was unresponsive.Â  The Hospital also presented evidence that Stokes had suffered a minor heart attack sometime prior to the surgery.Â  \r\nDuring trial, Appellant pointed out two pieces of medical documentation that were missing from Stokesâ€™s medical records.Â  First, there was evidence that blood had been drawn from Stokesâ€™s artery during the code.Â  This blood sample was drawn so that an arterial blood gas could be performed, which would indicate whether oxygen was reaching Stokesâ€™s bloodstream. The medical records, however, did not contain the results from this test.Â  The second piece of missing evidence was the vital signs flow chart prepared by the floor nurse at the time of Stokesâ€™s death.Â  The Hospital was unsure why the chart was missing, but speculated that it was misplaced during the code.Â  \r\nAt trial, the judge held a conference to discuss jury charges.Â  One of Plaintiffâ€™s requested charges was a â€œspoliation of evidenceâ€ charge, which allowed jurors to draw a negative inference if it found the Hospitalâ€™s explanation regarding the missing records unsatisfactory.Â  The trial judge agreed to the charge, and the Hospital did not object.Â  However, when it came time to charge the jury, the trial judge failed to give the â€œspoliation of evidenceâ€ instruction.Â  Appellant objected, but the court overruled the objection, explaining: â€œThat charge I have some problems with this.â€ \r\nWhen the jury came back with a defense verdict, Appellantâ€™s counsel moved for a new trial based on the jury charge.Â  The trial judge denied the motion, stating: â€œI could not have charged it as written I donâ€™t believe.Â  I would have had to have modified it.Â  And hopefully, my charge as a whole covered it and didnâ€™t prejudice your case in any way I hope.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court is required to charge the current and correct law.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 392, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2002). When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, our court must consider the charge as a whole, in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. Id.Â  An erroneous jury charge will not result in a verdict being reversed unless the charge prejudiced the appellantâ€™s case.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on â€œspoliation of evidence,â€ especially when the Hospital did not object to the proposed charge.[2]Â  We agree.\r\nIn Welch v. Gibbons, 211 S.C. 516, 46 S.E.2d 147 (1948), distinguished by Ex parte Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 248 S.C. 412, 415-16, 150 S.E.2d 525, 526-27 (1966), our supreme court recognized circumstances under which a jury should be able to consider missing evidence.Â  In Welch, the plaintiff sued a bottling plant, alleging it sold a soft drink which contained poison.Â  The plaintiff had in his possession the bottled drink, but neither tested the contents himself nor allowed the defendant to test its contents.Â  The supreme court held â€œthe evidence excluded was a circumstance which the jury should have been permitted to consider.â€ Id. The court also noted, â€œit is open to the plaintiff to explain his refusal to allow a chemical analysis to be made of the contents of this bottle and on another trial he is at liberty to do so.â€\r\nRelying on the holding in Welch, our supreme court later upheld a jury charge which advised that â€œwhen evidence is lost or destroyed by a party an inference may be drawn by the jury that the evidence which was lost or destroyed by that party would have been adverse to that party.â€Â  Kershaw County Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 302 S.C. 390, 394, 396 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1990).Â  In Kershaw, the school board sued the manufacturer of the ceiling plaster that had been installed in many of Kershaw Countyâ€™s schools, alleging the plaster contained asbestos.Â  The trial court issued an order requiring the manufacturer be notified prior to any asbestos being removed.Â  Despite this order, the school board did not notify the manufacturer before asbestos abatement was conducted at one of its schools, so the manufacturer moved for judgment in its favor on the claims related to that school.Â  The trial court denied the motion, but charged the jury as described above.Â  In upholding the charge, the supreme court stated: â€œ[T]he trial courtâ€™s decision was proper under the facts of this case.â€Â  Id.  \r\nIn the case at hand, there was evidence that two pieces of medical evidence were missing from Stokesâ€™s record: results from a blood test and the floor nurseâ€™s chart detailing Stokesâ€™s vital signs on the evening of his death.Â  Rebutting that evidence, the Hospital suggested the blood drawn from Stokesâ€™s artery on the night of his death may never have been sent to the laboratory for testing.Â  As for the missing chart, the Hospital speculated it may have been lost during the code.[3]Â  While the jury may well have accepted the Hospitalâ€™s explanations, it was also in its province to draw a negative inference from the Hospitalâ€™s failure to produce those pieces of evidence.Â  See id.\r\nAppellant requested the trial court charge the jury as follows:\r\n\r\nI charge you that when a party fails to preserve material evidence for trial, it is for you to determine whether the party has offered a satisfactory explanation for that failure.Â  If you find the explanation unsatisfactory, you are permitted â€“ but not required â€“ to draw the inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the partyâ€™s claim.\r\n\r\nWe believe this language reflects the law of South Carolina and should have been charged based on the evidence presented in this case.Â  While we recognize that no exact language is required, the charge as given made no mention of missing evidence at all.Â  Thus, we cannot say, as the Hospital urges, that the substance of the request was included in the trial judgeâ€™s general instructions.\r\nIn addition to being erroneous, we find the failure to charge on â€œspoliation of evidenceâ€ was prejudicial to Appellant.Â  Appellantâ€™s malpractice claim against the Hospital hinged on the jury believing Stokes died from lack of oxygen rather than from a sudden and unexpected heart attack.Â  Both pieces of evidence the Appellant alleges are missing would have helped determine how Stokes died.Â  Thus, it was crucial to Appellantâ€™s case that the jury know it could draw a negative inference from the Hospitalâ€™s failure to produce those important pieces of evidence.Â  We therefore find the Appellant was prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s failure to instruct the jury on â€œspoliation of evidence.â€ See, e.g., Baker v. Weaver, 279 S.C. 479, 309 S.E.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1983) (finding trial courtâ€™s erroneous jury charge prejudicial where requested instruction involved a substantial feature of the case).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on â€œspoliation of evidenceâ€ and that this error was prejudicial.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] The third floor is also an â€œoverflow areaâ€ for patients receiving urological or gynecological surgery. \r\n[2] The Hospital initially argues this issue is not preserved for review because the term â€œspoliation of evidenceâ€ was never referenced at trial.Â  While the exact term was not used, Appellant undeniably requested the jury be instructed that it could, but was not required to, draw a negative inference when a party fails to preserve material evidence for trial. Thus, we find the Hospitalâ€™s lack of preservation argument to be manifestly without merit.Â  See Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR (â€œThe court of appeals need not address a point that is manifestly without merit.â€).\r\n[3] In its brief, the Hospital also argues there was no evidence the vital signs flow chart maintained by the floor nurse was missing because the nurse did not testify at trial.Â  However, several other witnesses testified that they reviewed the nurseâ€™s deposition and that she filled out the chart during her treatment of Stokes.Â  This testimony came in without objection, and therefore the jury was presented with evidence that the chart was missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4079","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nRobert Bethune King, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  The State appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision to overturn Roy Baileyâ€™s magistrate court conviction for disorderly conduct.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 15, 2002, Roy Bailey and Calvin Ladd, one of Baileyâ€™s employees, pulled into the Speedway gas station to get gas for the company truck.Â  The company had a gas card with Speedway, and Ladd got out of the truck, swiped the gas card on the pump, and pumped $29 worth of gas.Â  After pumping the gas, Ladd informed Bailey that the pump did not print a receipt.Â  The two went inside the gas station to request a receipt from the clerk.Â  The clerk informed the two that the gas had not been paid for.Â  A dispute arose over whether the transaction on the gas card actually processed, and the police were called.Â  \r\nDeputy Stacy Brooks arrived on the scene.Â  He testified that when he entered the store, Bailey was â€œextremely argumentative and loud and boisterousâ€ such that customers inside the store were stopping to stare.Â  Brooks stated he attempted to calm Bailey and asked him to step outside the store.Â  Deputy Giles Gladsen arrived at that point and remained outside with Bailey while Brooks returned inside the store to get the clerkâ€™s version of the events.Â  After the clerk showed Brooks the computer screen indicating that Bailey did not pay for the gas, Brooks returned outside to inform Bailey that he needed to pay for the gas.Â  Brooks testified that Bailey then became loud, boisterous, and argumentative with him and Gladsen.Â  According to Brooks, although Bailey never used profanity, his behavior drew a lot of attention from people inside and outside the store and that Bailey was â€œabsolutely disorderly within the view of the general public.â€Â  Brooks also testified that after Bailey refused to pay for the gas, he â€œcontinued being loud and boisterous with myself and Deputy Gladsen.Â  At which point we had no choice but to place him under arrest for at the time petit larceny and public disorderly conduct.â€[2]Â  Deputy Gladsen similarly testified that Bailey was very loud and became disorderly and belligerent with him outside the store within close proximity of other people.Â  Bailey was arrested for disorderly conduct.Â  He complained of chest pains, and he was taken to the hospital for treatment.Â Â Â  \r\nThe State rested its case after presenting the testimony of Deputies Brooks and Gladsen.Â  Bailey immediately moved for a directed verdict, arguing the State failed to prove that Bailey used fighting words towards the police officers, and thus, he could not be convicted of disorderly conduct pursuant to State v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991).Â  The magistrate agreed Perkins may have some applicability, but he found there was evidence that Bailey was loud and boisterous in violation of section 16-17-530 such that the matter should go to the jury.Â  After the denial of the motion for a directed verdict, Bailey presented evidence.[3]Â Â Â  \r\nCalvin Ladd, the employee with Bailey, testified that he and Bailey went inside the store to get a receipt for the gas card transaction.Â  According to Ladd, he did â€œall the talkingâ€ with the store clerk regarding the gas card transaction, not Bailey, and the discussion was calm.Â  Ladd stated Bailey was not loud with the deputies when they were talking outside, and he could not hear what was being said.Â  \r\nBailey similarly testified at trial that Ladd was the person who spoke with the store clerk regarding the gas card.Â  Bailey testified that once he was outside the store, Deputy Brooks threatened him, stating that Bailey should pay for the gas or else Brooks would find something with which to charge him.Â  Bailey denied ever being loud or disrespectful with the deputies, and he stated that he only yelled when he was having chest pains and wanted medical attention.Â  Bailey also denied there was a large crowd at the gas station watching the events.Â  Bailey was convicted by the jury and sentenced to thirty days in jail, suspended upon the payment of a $258 fine.Â Â  \r\nBailey appealed his conviction to the circuit court, arguing the magistrate court erred in:Â  (1) failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict; and (2) failing to give his requested jury instructions, especially the one regarding â€œfighting wordsâ€ which must be present in order to charge one with disorderly conduct towards a police officer pursuant to Perkins.Â  After hearing arguments by both parties, the circuit court issued a form order reversing Baileyâ€™s conviction.Â  The State appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from magistrate court convictions are made to the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§18-3-10 (Supp. 2004).Â  The circuit court, acting as the appellate court, reviews the matters raised in the notice of appeal.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-70 (Supp. 2004) (â€œThe appeal must be heard by the Court of Common Pleas upon the grounds of exceptions made and upon the papers required under this chapter, without the examination of witnesses . . . .â€); State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œIn criminal appeals from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception.â€).Â  The appellate court reviewing the circuit court appeal may review for errors of law only.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred in reversing Baileyâ€™s conviction because: (1) the directed verdict issue was not preserved; (2) it was error to rely on Perkins; and (3) there was sufficient evidence to support Baileyâ€™s conviction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA. Preservation\r\nThe State initially argues the circuit court erred in reversing the magistrate courtâ€™s denial of Baileyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on an unpreserved ground because Bailey failed to renew his motion for a directed verdict after the presentation of all the evidence.[4]Â  \r\nThe State raises this issue for the first time on appeal to this court.Â  The State never brought the preservation issue, an additional sustaining ground, to the attention of the circuit court on appeal.Â  See Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (noting that although a respondent may raise an additional sustaining ground on appeal, respondent may also â€œabandon an additional sustaining ground . . . by failing to raise it in the appellate brief.â€).Â  Instead, both Bailey and the State vigorously argued the merits of whether Bailey was entitled to a directed verdict based upon Perkins.Â  The circuit court reviewed the issues raised before it and reversed Baileyâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\nBecause the preservation issue was never brought to the attention of the circuit court on appeal, no ruling on the matter was ever issued.Â  Further, nothing in the record indicates the State brought the matter to the attention of the circuit court in a petition for rehearing.Â  Accordingly, it is not appropriate for this court to review it.Â  See City of Columbia v. Ervin, 330 S.C. 516, 519-20, 500 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1998) (noting that the Court of Appeals should not have addressed an issue on appeal where Ervin failed to raise the issue to the circuit court as intermediate appellate court); Condor, Inc., v. Board of Zoning Appeals, 328 S.C. 173, 178 n.4, 493 S.E.2d 342, 344 n.4 (1997) (holding that an issue which was not presented in the verified petition of appeal to the circuit court was not properly preserved for review by the supreme court); see also Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 75-76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (noting in dicta that petitioner had preservation problems of its own where petitioner complained that issues reviewed by the Court of Appeals were not preserved for appellate review, but petitioner failed to â€œraise all of these issues to the Court of Appeals in its petition for rehearing;â€ the court further noted that it believed the issues were preserved for review by the Court of Appeals).Â  \r\nB.Â  Propriety of Directed Verdict\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred in reversing the denial of Baileyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict because it erroneously relied upon Perkins and because enough evidence existed to support Baileyâ€™s guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 583, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001); State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Burdette, 335 S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at 531; State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 197, 473 S.E.2d 831, 835 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œIf there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€Â  Lollis, 343 S.C. at 584, 541 S.E.2d at 256.Â  â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.â€Â  State v. Rosemond, 356 S.C. 426, 429, 589 S.E.2d 757, 758 (2003). \r\nBailey was charged with public disorderly conduct.Â  The pertinent portion of the public disorderly conduct statute provides that it is a misdemeanor for a person to â€œbe found . . . at any public place or public gathering . . . otherwise conducting himself in a disorderly or boisterous manner . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530(a) (2003).Â  However, there is an additional requirement that â€œfighting wordsâ€ must be used when one is charged with disorderly conduct towards a police officer.Â  See State v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 355, 412 S.E.2d 385, 386 (1991) (â€œ[A]ppellants cannot be punished under Â§ 16-17-530(a) for voicing their objections to sheriffâ€™s officers where the record indicates no use of fighting words.â€); see also City of Landrum v. Sarratt, 352 S.C. 139, 144, 572 S.E.2d 476, 479 (Ct. App. 2002) (noting the Perkins court narrowly applied the fighting words exception to â€œcases involving words addressed to a police officerâ€); State v. LaCoste, 347 S.C. 153, 163-64, 553 S.E.2d 464, 470 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding there was ample evidence of disorderly conduct to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion for a directed verdict where the defendant shouted obscenities at officers, threw his hands up in a hostile manner, refused to comply with officersâ€™ demands, challenged the officers, and taunted the officers about their inability to get him under control); City of Columbia v. Brown, 316 S.C. 432, 436-37, 450 S.E.2d 117, 119-20 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting that the defendantâ€™s actions met the definition of â€œfighting wordsâ€ where he shouted obscenities and racial slurs at police officers on a public street, he was not challenging any police action, and he was repeatedly told by the officers to leave the area prior to arresting him for loitering).Â  \r\nIn Perkins, the two appellants went to the sheriffâ€™s office to obtain a copy of an incident report in order to obtain a warrant from the magistrate.Â  After being told that the incident report was not yet available, the appellants became upset and raised their voices inside the sheriffâ€™s office.Â  They were arrested upon leaving the sheriffâ€™s office and were charged with disorderly conduct.Â  In reversing the appellantsâ€™ convictions, our state supreme court noted as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œ[T]he First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.â€Â  City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2505, 96 L.Ed.2d 398, 412 (1987).Â  The State may not punish a person for voicing an objection to a police officer where no â€œfighting wordsâ€ are used.Â  Norwell v. Cincinnati, 414 U.S. 14, 94 S.Ct. 187, 38 L.Ed.2d 170 (1973).Â  To punish only spoken words addressed to a police officer, a statute must be limited in scope to fighting words that â€œby their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.â€Â  Hill, 482 U.S. at 461-62, 107 S.Ct. at 2509-10, 96 L.Ed.2d at 412 (quoting Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974)).Â  As further noted by the United States Supreme Court, the â€œfighting wordsâ€ exception may require narrow application in cases involving words addressed to a police officer â€œbecause a properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen.â€Â  Hill, 482 U.S. at 462, 107 S.Ct. at 2510, 96 L.Ed.2d at 412.Â  As stated by the high court:Â  The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.Â  Id. at 462-63, 107 S.Ct. at 2510, 96 L.Ed.2d at 412-13.Â  \r\n\r\nPerkins, 306 S.C. at 386, 412 S.E.2d at 354-55.\r\nIn the present case, the circuit court relied upon Perkins in reversing Baileyâ€™s conviction.Â  The courtâ€™s form order stated â€œOfficerâ€™s [sic] clearly arrested Mr. Bailey for being boisterous toward the officers.Â  Under Perkins, the case is reversed as a matter of law.â€Â  Thus, it appears the circuit court ruled Bailey was entitled to a directed verdict pursuant to Perkins.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there was evidence to support a finding that Baileyâ€™s conduct inside the store amounted to â€œdisorderly conductâ€ such that a directed verdict would be improper.Â  However, Bailey was not arrested for his conduct inside the store.Â  Despite the deputiesâ€™ testimony that Bailey was disorderly in view of the public, Bailey was not placed under arrest until after his confrontation with the deputies outside.Â  There is no evidence in the record that anything Bailey said to the deputies amounted to â€œfighting words.â€Â  Thus, pursuant to Perkins, Baileyâ€™s actions outside did not amount to disorderly conduct.Â  Bailey was entitled to a directed verdict on the disorderly conduct charge.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not commit an error of law in reversing Baileyâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Bailey was arrested for being boisterous with the deputies and there was no evidence that his language amounted to â€œfighting words,â€ the circuit court correctly reversed Baileyâ€™s conviction for disorderly conduct.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Although the deputies intended to charge Bailey with petit larceny for failing to pay for the gas, Baileyâ€™s employee paid for the gas, and the charges were dropped.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[3] Bailey failed to renew his motion for directed verdict at the close of all evidence.Â Â  \r\n[4]Â  If a defendant presents evidence after the denial of his directed verdict motion at the close of the Stateâ€™s case, he must make another directed verdict motion at the close of all evidence in order to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence.Â  State v. Adams, 332 S.C. 139, 144, 504 S.E.2d 124, 126-27 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4080","title":"Lukich v.

Lukich (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s order barring her from using her decree of annulment of a prior marriage as a defense against George P. Lukichâ€™s (Husband) complaint to void their marriage as bigamous.Â  Wife also contends the family court erred by holding Husband â€œtechnically in contemptâ€ but ruling Husband did not have to comply with the temporary order pending the outcome of his motion to vacate that order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n    In March 1985, Husband and Wife participated in a marriage ceremony and lived together as a married couple for eighteen years.Â  In 1999, the parties began to experience difficulties after Wife suffered a debilitating stroke. Thereafter, on August 21, 2002, Wife filed a complaint in Berkeley County for separate support and maintenance, alleging physical cruelty and adultery and seeking spousal support, equitable distribution, and attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  After a temporary hearing, Judge Jack Landis issued a temporary order awarding Wife $1350 per month in alimony, $3500 in temporary attorneysâ€™ fees, and restraining both parties from encumbering or disposing of marital property.Â  \r\n    During the course of discovery, Husband began to suspect Wife never obtained a divorce from Charles Havron, whom she married in 1973.Â  Therefore, Husband made a discovery request that Wife produce a copy of the divorce decree from Havron.Â  Although the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control produced a marriage certificate for Wife and Havron, Wife could not produce a divorce decree for her marriage to Havron.Â  On September 25, 2003 Husband filed a complaint in Berkeley County seeking to void his marriage to Wife on the ground of bigamy, and a hearing was set for November 6, 2003.Â  \r\n    On October 21, 2003, Wife filed a complaint in Charleston County to have her marriage to Havron annulled.Â  An uncontested hearing was held on October 31, 2003 before Judge Frances Segars-Andrews.Â  At the hearing Wife produced evidence that she and Havron were married during a night of heavy drinking, had never lived together as husband and wife, and shortly after the marriage Havron moved to Illinois.Â  Havron submitted an affidavit corroborating Wifeâ€™s testimony and did not contest the annulment.Â  Judge Segars-Andrews granted Wife an annulment from Havron, declaring the marriage void ab initio.Â  \r\n    After Wife faxed a copy of the order of annulment to Husband, Husband made a motion to intervene in Wifeâ€™s annulment proceeding.Â  Husband argued he had standing due to the effect the annulment would have on his pending action against Wife to void their marriage on the ground of bigamy.Â  Judge Segars-Andrews denied Husbandâ€™s motion to intervene, finding he did not have standing because he was not a party to the marriage.Â  \r\n    On November 5, 2003, Wife filed a motion to dismiss Husbandâ€™s complaint to void the marriage.Â  Wife asserted that because her marriage to Havron had been annulled, Husband could no longer prove their marriage was bigamous, and, alternatively, Husbandâ€™s complaint was procedurally defective.Â  Judge Wayne Creech granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that Husband filed his complaint under the same case number as Wifeâ€™s complaint for separate support and maintenance.Â  However, Judge Creech ruled Wife was barred from using her order of annulment from Havron as a defense to Husbandâ€™s action to void their marriage as bigamous.Â  Wife appeals the ruling.Â Â Â  \r\n    On January 14, 2004 Wife filed a rule to show cause, alleging Husband had failed to pay temporary support and was in violation of the temporary order.Â  Judge Creech ruled that Husband was â€œtechnicallyâ€ in contempt for failure to make support payments.Â  However, Judge Creech (hereafter â€œthe family courtâ€) ordered Husband â€œshould not be sanctioned or required to make payment under the Temporary Order until his Motion to vacate the alimony award is heard and determined by the Court.â€ Â Wifeâ€™s motion to alter or amend the order was denied.Â  Wife appeals.[1]  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANNULMENT DECREE\r\n        Wife argues the family court erred by barring her from using the order of annulment from Havron as a defense to Husbandâ€™s action to void their marriage as bigamous.Â  Wife contends the annulment decree rendered her marriage to Havron void ab initio, which creates the legal fiction that the marriage never existed.Â  Wife asserts that because her marriage to Havron was rendered a non-occurrence in the eyes of the law, her marriage to Husband is not bigamous even though she was, in reality, married to Havron at the time she and Husband participated in the marriage ceremony.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n       \r\n        Section 20-1-80 of the South Carolina Code Annotated sets forth the principle that â€œ[a]ll marriages contracted while either of the parties has a former wife or husband living shall be void.â€Â  This statute codifies the overriding public policy of this state against bigamy.Â  Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 203, 420 S.E.2d 856, 859 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding the public policy of not recognizing bigamous marriages overrides the public policy supporting the finality of judgments).Â  A person who is married cannot enter into a valid marriage by participating in a marriage ceremony with a new person.Â  Day v. Day, 216 S.C. 334, 338, 58 S.E.2d 83, 85 (1950) (â€œA mere marriage ceremony between a man and a woman, where one of them has a living wife or husband, is not a marriage at all.Â  Such a marriage is absolutely void, and not merely voidable.â€).Â  \r\n        Therefore, we are left to consider the question of whether an annulment which decrees a pre-existing marriage void ab initio can be used as a defense to an action to void a marriage as bigamous because the annulment relates back so as to give validity to a prior bigamous marriage.Â  Although our courts have not specifically addressed this issue, we have generally held that because a bigamous marriage is void at its inception and not merely voidable, it cannot be ratified or confirmed and thereby made valid.Â  Johns, 309 S.C. at 201, 420 S.E.2d at 858; see also Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, __, 620 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2005) (holding when there is an impediment to marriage, such as one partyâ€™s existing marriage to a third person, no common-law marriage may been formed and the relationship is not automatically transformed into a common-law marriage once the impediment is removed); Prevatte v. Prevatte, 297 S.C. 345, 349, 377 S.E.2d 114, 117 (Ct. App. 1989) (holding a relationship illicit at its inception does not ripen into a common-law marriage once the impediment to marriage is removed and the parties must agree to enter into a common-law marriage after the impediment is removed) (quoting Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 280 S.C. 546, 551, 314 S.E.2d 16, 19 (Ct. App. 1984));Â  Kirby v. Kirby, 270 S.C. 137, 140 , 241 S.E.2d 415, 416 (1978) (same).\r\n        Wife argues Joye v. Von, 355 S.C. 452, 586 S.E.2d 131 (2003), supports her position in the case at bar.Â  In Joye, the parties divorced and Husband was ordered to pay Wife periodic alimony.Â  Id. at 454, 586 S.E.2d at 132.Â  Thereafter, Wife entered into a new marriage with Vance, so Husband stopped making alimony payments to Wife.Â  Id.Â  However, two months into the marriage, Wife discovered that Vance had never divorced his former spouse, so she had the marriage annulled.Â  Id.Â  Wife then brought a contempt action against Husband for failure to make alimony payments, arguing that because her subsequent marriage was void ab initio, Husbandâ€™s obligation to make alimony payments never terminated.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court considered the novel issue of whether an annulment of a remarriage reinstates a previous spouseâ€™s periodic alimony obligation.Â  Id. at 454, 586 S.E.2d at 133. \r\n        After discussing several approaches taken by other jurisdictions, our supreme court held the family court should apply the principles of equity and utilize a case by case approach to determine whether the payor spouseâ€™s periodic alimony obligation is revived after the payee spouseâ€™s subsequent marriage is annulled.Â  Id. at 456, 586 S.E.2d at 134.Â  The court also held that regardless of whether the family court determined to reinstate periodic alimony or not, Husband had no obligation to pay retroactive alimony to Wife for the time period that Wife was married to her bigamous Husband.Â  Id. at 457, 586 S.E.2d at 134.Â  \r\n        The Joye case, though not directly applicable to the facts in the instant case, leaves open the possibility that an annulment may operate to revive a previous spouseâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  However, the supreme court did not hold the annulment created the presumption that the Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation never terminated.Â  Id. at 456, 586 S.E.2d at 134.Â  Instead, the supreme court explicitly stated that Husband had no obligation to pay alimony for the time period Wife thought she was married to Vance, even though the marriage was void ab initio.Â  Id. at 457, 585 S.E.2d at 134.Â  Therefore, Joye does not support Wifeâ€™s position and is not controlling.Â Â Â  \r\n        As this case involves a novel issue of law in South Carolina, â€œwe look to other jurisdictions for edification, enlightenment, and guidance.â€Â  State v. Mitchell,&nbsp;362 S.C. 289, 299-300, 608 S.E.2d 140, 145&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  In Scarboro v. Morgan, 233 N.C. 449, 64 S.E.2d 422 (N.C. 1951), the North Carolina Supreme Court addressed the issue in a factually similar case.Â  In Scarboro, Wife entered into a marriage with Husband while the Wife was lawfully married to another man.Â  233 N.C. at 451, 64 S.E.2d at 423.Â Â Â  After Husband died, his heirs brought suit to declare his marriage to Wife void as bigamous.Â  Id. at 450, 64 S.E.2d at 422.Â  Wife argued her motion for nonsuit should have been granted for failure to make out a case of bigamous marriage against her.Â  Id. at 451, 64 S.E.2d at 423.Â  She asserted the trial court erred in refusing to permit her to offer into evidence an annulment decree that declared her previous marriage void ab initio.Â  Id. at 451-52, 64 S.E.2d at 423.Â  As in the case at bar, the judgment granting Wife an annulment from her previous marriage was rendered after the suit to have her marriage to Husband declared void was instituted.Â  Id. at 452, 64 S.E.2d at 423.Â  The North Carolina Supreme Court held that the underlying annulment decree was invalid because it was in conflict with a controlling statute.Â  Id. at 452, 64 S.E.2d at 423-24.Â  However, the court also stated:Â  â€œBut should we concede, arguendo, that the judgment is valid, it would be\r\n        effective only from the date of rendition and would not affect the instant case so as to give retroactive validity to a prior bigamous marriage.â€Â  Scarboro, 233 N.C. at 452, 64 S.E.2d at 424.Â  \r\n        Additionally, the general rule applicable in situations as before us is stated in 52 Am.Jur. 2d Marriage Â§57:\r\n\r\n  [A]part from statute, bigamous marriage does not acquire validity when the prior subsisting marriage is legally terminated by divorce or by the death of the first spouse. The same rule is generally followed where the prior subsisting marriage is annulled after the\r\n  second marriage is contracted, even though the purpose of an annulment proceeding is to declare that no valid marriage ever took place between the parties or that no valid marriage relation ever existed between the parties.\r\n  Even where the annulment decree expressly declares the first marriage null and void ab initio, it does not relate back so as to validate the second marriage. In order for the subsequent marriage to be valid, it has been held that there must be a new ceremony following the termination of the earlier marriage.\r\n\r\n        Based on our strong public policy against recognizing bigamous marriages and our reading of relevant authority, we find an annulment that declares a pre-existing marriage void ab initio does not relate back so as to give validity to a marriage that was bigamous before the annulment was granted.[2]Â  Here, Wife had a living spouse at the time she contracted for marriage with Husband.Â  Because Wifeâ€™s annulment was not granted until after she contracted for marriage with Husband, the annulment does not validate her marriage with Husband.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in barring Wife from using her annulment decree as a defense to Husbandâ€™s bigamy action.Â Â  \r\n        Additionally, Wifeâ€™s argument that she had a good-faith belief she was not married to Havron does not change the rule that the bigamous marriage was void. Even if Wife was acting under a good-faith belief, South Carolina will not recognize her bigamous second marriage because to do so would violate public policy.Â  See Johns, 309 S.C. at 202-03, 420 S.E.2d at 858-59 (citations omitted). \r\n        Wife contends the family court should have considered additional information in her motion to alter or amend because to do so would have shed light on the circumstances surrounding her marriage to Havron.Â  Wife also argues the family court, without explicitly stating so, barred her from using her annulment decree as a defense to Husbandâ€™s action to void the marriage because she did not notify Husband she was not divorced from Havron and she did not notify Husband of the annulment hearing.Â  However, it is undisputed Wife had not divorced or obtained an annulment from Havron at the time she contracted for marriage with Husband.Â  Having held Wife may not use her annulment decree as a defense to Husbandâ€™s bigamy action on the basis that an annulment that declares a pre-existing marriage void ab initio does not relate back so as to give validity to a marriage that was bigamous at the time the annulment was granted, we need not address these issues.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€); see alsoÂ \r\n        Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 417, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000).\r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONTEMPT\r\n        Wife argues that although the family court ruled Husband was â€œtechnically in contempt for failure to make support payments as ordered,â€ the ruling was tantamount to finding Husband was not in contempt because the court ordered Husband was not required to comply with the temporary order pending the outcome of his motion to vacate that order.Â  We disagree.\r\n        A decision on contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Â Tirado v. Tirado, 339 S.C. 649, 654, 530 S.E.2d 128, 131 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œOn appeal, a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if it is without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.â€ Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840 (1988).Â  Our review of the order reveals the family court found Husband in contempt.Â  The court declined to impose sanctions against Husband because the validity of his alimony obligation was in question and Husband had a pending motion to vacate the alimony award.Â  Because there is no requirement that sanctions be imposed upon the finding of contempt, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Sutton v. Sutton, 291 S.C. 401, 409, 353 S.E.2d 884, 888-89 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œAlthough the Family Court is empowered to find and punish for contempt, there is no requirement that sanctions be imposed upon a finding of contempt.â€).\r\n        The family court ordered Husband â€œshould not be . . . required to make payment under the Temporary Order until his Motion to Vacate the alimony award is heard and determined by the Court.â€Â  The court also ruled that alimony would continue to accrue in the meantime and retained personal jurisdiction to determine whether the temporary order should be vacated.Â  Wife also contends the family court was without authority to stay enforcement of the temporary order sua sponte.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n        Wife contends the court had no authority to stay the enforcement of the temporary order because the only issue before the court was whether Husband was in contempt.Â  However, Wife essentially raised the issue in bringing the rule to show cause.Â  Wife claimed Husband was in contempt for failing to make alimony payments in violation of the temporary order.Â  Husband defended, asserting he had filed a motion to vacate the award approximately four months earlier, but the matter had not been set for hearing.Â  Based on these facts, the issue of whether the temporary order should be enforced pending the outcome of Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate the alimony award was incidental to the courtâ€™s determination of contempt.Â  See Taylor v. Taylor, 294 S.C. 296, 299, 363 S.E.2d 909, 911 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding the issue of child support arrearages was necessarily raised by a rule to show cause; therefore, the family court had authority to find father had purged himself of arrearages in the contempt proceeding).Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not err in staying the enforcement of the temporary order.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n        AFFIRMED.\r\n         GOOLSBY J., concurs.\r\n        ANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n        ANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of my fellow judges in the case sub judice.Â  I VOTE to reverse and remand for a new trial.Â  \r\n        After perturbation and disquietude resulting from my analysis of the evidentiary record, I have come to the ineluctable conclusion to dissent.Â  My concernment is nexed to the lack of viability given to the annulment declaring the marriage â€œvoid ab initioâ€ by the majority.\r\n        The annulment ruling the marriage â€œvoid ab initioâ€ was an arbitrament by a family court judge.Â  The family court had subject matter jurisdiction at the time of the issuance of the annulment.Â  \r\n        The majority has misconstrued and misapplied the efficacy of the annulment order of the family court.Â  The Latin phrase â€œab initioâ€ has definite and certain meaning.Â  â€œAb initioâ€ in Latin means â€œfrom the beginning.â€Â  An agreement is said to be â€œvoid ab initioâ€ if it has at no time had any legal validity.\r\n        The majority opinion fails to recognize that the family court judge had the authority and power to issue the annulment and to order the marriage â€œvoid ab initio.â€\r\n        I VOTE to REVERSE.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n[1]Â  The parties made a motion to consolidate the two appeals and we granted the motion.Â  \r\n[2]Â  We note that our holding is limited to the facts of the case at bar, e.g. the situation where the annulled marriage would be valid but for an annulment decree declaring the marriage ab initio.Â  Our holding is not meant to affect a party who enters into one of the three types of marriages that never have legal validity in South Carolina, namely marriages that are void ab initio by operation of statute:Â  (1) bigamous marriages, S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-1-80 (Supp. 2004); (2) same sex marriages, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-1-15 (Supp. 2004); and (3) marriages of minors under the age of 16, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-1-100 (Supp. 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
