Culbertson, of Greenville, for respondent William Grosskurth.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPER CURIAM: This \r\n  appeal involves three separate actions brought by (1)&nbsp;Larry E. Davis and \r\n  his wife, Joanne, (2) James Hugh Schumpert and his wife, Zan, and (3)&nbsp;William \r\n  Grosskurth, as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident. The \r\n  three cases were consolidated at trial and for appeal. We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 12, 1993, respondents \r\n  Davis, Schumpert, and Grosskurth (collectively, the employees) were working \r\n  for Norfolk Southern Railway Company on a run from Atlanta to Greenville. Under \r\n  the law applicable to railway employees, they could work only twelve hours a \r\n  day. Upon the train's arrival in Seneca, the employees had worked almost twelve \r\n  hours. Consequently, Norfolk Southern contacted INA Limousine Service,(1) \r\n  which was under contract with Norfolk Southern, to transport these employees \r\n  to Greenville, South Carolina where they would \"mark off work\" and spend the \r\n  night. \r\n   \r\nLeroy Miller drove the taxi that \r\n  transported the employees. On the way to Greenville, the taxi collided with \r\n  a pickup truck driven by Appellant Gerald Tripp at the intersection of Highway \r\n  123 and Fish Trap Road in Pickens County. Tripp, traveling on the subordinate \r\n  road, had pulled first into the median, and then into the path of the oncoming \r\n  taxi.  \r\n   \r\nThe employees brought separate actions \r\n  for personal injuries they sustained in the resulting collision. Davis's wife \r\n  and Schumpert's wife also commenced actions for loss of consortium. The actions \r\n  were consolidated at trial, and the jury returned verdicts of $300,000 for Davis, \r\n  $39,000 for Schumpert, and $13,500 for Grosskurth. The trial court sua sponte \r\n  refused to submit to the jury the wives' loss of consortium claims. All of the \r\n  employees, as well as the wives, appeal.(2) This \r\n  court granted a motion for consolidation of the appeals. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the trial court err in failing \r\n  to dismiss Grosskurth's action in light of his alleged failure to meet the applicable \r\n  statute of limitations? \r\n   \r\nII. Did the trial court err by refusing \r\n  to admit testimony concerning Norfolk Southern's firing of the employees because \r\n  the excluded testimony was essential to the jury's proper evaluation of the \r\n  employees' damages? \r\n   \r\nIII. Did the trial court err in failing \r\n  to charge the jury under Horton v. Greyhound Corp., 241 S.C. 430, 128 \r\n  S.E.2d 776 (1962), as to the role Miller's speed played in the accident?  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. Did the trial court err in failing \r\n  to submit to the jury the wives' loss of consortium claims? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON GROSSKURTH'S COMPLAINT \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe accident occurred on October \r\n  12, 1993. On September 13, 1996, Grosskurth timely filed a summons \r\n  and complaint against Charles Duncan, d/b/a Duncan Red Bird Limo; Leroy Miller, \r\n  as agent for Duncan Red Bird Limo; and Norfolk Southern Railway Company. Appellants \r\n  moved for summary judgment, asserting the statutes of limitations barred Grosskurth's \r\n  action, as none of them were served within three years of the date of the accident. \r\n  The trial court denied the summary judgment motion. Appellants argue the trial \r\n  judge erred in denying their summary judgment motion. This issue is not appealable. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe denial of a motion for summary \r\n  judgment is not directly appealable because it does not finally determine anything \r\n  about the case's merits. Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d \r\n  379 (1994). This is true even after a trial of the case on its merits. Raino \r\n  v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 422 S.E.2d 98 (1992). \"Issues \r\n  relating to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, cannot be \r\n  waived even by consent, and should be taken notice of by this court on our own \r\n  motion.\" Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A. v. Player, 334 S.C. 200, \r\n  205, 512 S.E.2d 129, 132 (Ct. App. 1999) (referencing Johnson v. State, \r\n  319 S.C. 62, 64, 459 S.E.2d 840, 841 (1995)). However, a statute of limitations \r\n  defense does not raise a question of subject matter jurisdiction. McLendon \r\n  v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 313 S.C. 525, 443 \r\n  S.E.2d 539 (1994). Therefore, this court cannot address the trial court's denial \r\n  of Appellants' summary judgment motion as to Grosskurth. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. TESTIMONY \r\n  AS TO THE FIRING OF DAVIS, SCHUMPERT, AND GROSSKURTH \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAll Appellants argue the trial court \r\n  erred in not allowing them to present evidence that the employees were fired \r\n  after the accident, thereby refuting an inference that their particular jobs \r\n  with Norfolk Southern were available to the employees during the entire time \r\n  of their incapacities.  \r\n   \r\nAn injured party who is employed \r\n  at the time of his injury, may present proof of the loss of wages between the \r\n  date of occurrence of the injury and the date he can return to work as elements \r\n  of damages. Moreover, if the party was employed at the time of the injury, his \r\n  earnings are evidence of the value of his lost time and are admissible as evidence \r\n  of that value. 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages Â§ 156 (1988). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Appellants proffered testimony \r\n  that while en route to Greenville, the employees bought and consumed beer. After \r\n  a disciplinary hearing on December 20, 1993, the employees were \"taken out of \r\n  service\" for consuming alcohol while on the job in violation of Norfolk Southern \r\n  regulations. Norfolk Southern terminated the employees on December 29, 1993, \r\n  retroactive to October 13, 1993. The employees were rehired on March 12, 1994, \r\n  but would not have received any wages for the intervening period. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe employees moved in limine to \r\n  exclude evidence that they had been fired as unduly prejudicial. They argued \r\n  this discipline \"does not, as a matter of law, affect the quantum of damages \r\n  to which either plaintiff is entitled so long as they were physically unable \r\n  to work, because of injuries sustained in the subject crash, during the period \r\n  of time covered by their discipline and dismissal.\" The employees argued that \r\n  if this evidence was allowed, they would be prevented from collecting damages \r\n  for lost wages resulting from the injuries caused by the Appellants. The trial \r\n  court agreed and granted the motion.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe employees' suit against Norfolk \r\n  Southern is brought pursuant to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), \r\n  45 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 51-60 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999). Evidentiary decisions in FELA \r\n  cases are matters of federal law. Hose v. Chicago Northwestern Transp. Co., \r\n  70 F.3d 968 (8th Cir. 1995) (citing Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. v. Liepelt, \r\n  444 U.S. 490 (1980)); see also Haselden v. Atlantic Coast Line R. \r\n  Co., 214 S.C. 410, 418, 53 S.E.2d 60, 63 (1949)(\"evidence and exceptions \r\n  should be considered in the light of the Federal decisions interpreting [FELA]\"). \r\n  Under federal law, this court reviews the trial court's evidentiary and procedural \r\n  rulings for an abuse of discretion. Persinger v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. \r\n  Co., 920 F.2d 1185 (4th Cir. 1990). The same standard applies to the employees' \r\n  common law suit against Tripp and the INA Appellants. See Gamble v. \r\n  International Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996) (the \r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse \r\n  of that discretion).  \r\n   \r\nAppellants argue the fact the employees \r\n  were not employed by Norfolk Southern from October 13, 1993 through March 12, \r\n  1994, proves \"they have lost no wages\" during that time. Further, evidence of \r\n  the unavailability of the employees' jobs is relevant to their inability to \r\n  earn the sums they seek in lost wages. They argue that without this evidence \r\n  \"the jury was left with the mistaken impression that, but for the accident, \r\n  the [employees] would still be earning the same income they received before \r\n  the accident.\" We disagree. The evidence shows Davis and Schumpert were totally \r\n  incapacitated during the period of their termination and were not able to hold \r\n  down other employment. But for their injuries, these employees, presumably would \r\n  have been able to work for another employer. They were deprived of that opportunity \r\n  by the negligence of the Appellants. Evidence of the wages paid them by Norfolk \r\n  Southern is therefore admissible to show what they could have earned elsewhere \r\n  if they had not been injured. See Hall v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., \r\n  829 F. Supp. 1571 (N.D. Ga. 1993).(3) Under the \r\n  unique circumstances of this case, we reject Appellants' claim that they should \r\n  have been permitted to show the employees' jobs were unavailable during the \r\n  period of termination.(4) We also disagree with \r\n  the assertion that the employees had the burden of proving other jobs were available \r\n  and the wages they could have earned at other jobs when, in any event, they \r\n  would not have been able to seek other employment because of their injuries. \r\n  McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987)(\"Whatever \r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.\") Therefore, evidence of the employees' \r\n  termination by Norfolk Southern was not relevant to their ability to earn wages \r\n  and, accordingly, we do not find the trial court abused its discretion in preventing \r\n  the introduction of this evidence. First Savings Bank v. McLean, 314 \r\n  S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994)(appellant has the burden of showing both error \r\n  and prejudice). \r\n   \r\nAppellants further argue the employees' \r\n  recovery of their lost wages is governed by the Railway Labor Act. The Act governs \r\n  only to the extent the employees attempt to recover wages resulting from their \r\n  dismissal. Here, the employees seek to recover wages for the time they were \r\n  unable to work due to their injuries, not as a result of their dismissal. Therefore, \r\n  the Railway Labor Act does not govern this issue. We therefore affirm the trial \r\n  court's decision to exclude evidence of the employees' termination. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  FAILURE TO CHARGE JURY REGARDING MILLER'S SPEED \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe INA Appellants and Norfolk Southern \r\n  appeal the trial court's decision not to instruct the jury in accordance with \r\n  Horton v. Greyhound Corp., 241 S.C. 430, 128 S.E.2d 776 (1962). We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nINA, relying on Horton, requested \r\n  the jury receive the following instruction: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe fact that a vehicle's speed places \r\n  that vehicle at a particular location on a highway when a collision occurs is \r\n  without legal significance if that vehicle has a legal right to occupy that \r\n  portion of the highway. In order for speed to be considered a contributing factor \r\n  to a collision, there must be some evidence that if the vehicle had been operated \r\n  at a reasonable speed, it could have been stopped at some distance short of \r\n  the point of collision.\r\nIn Horton the supreme court \r\n  noted the plaintiff must prove not only that the defendant bus driver was negligent, \r\n  but also that \"such negligence on his part was a proximate cause of the fatal \r\n  collision. Negligence may be deemed a proximate cause of an injury only when \r\n  without such negligence the harm would not have occurred or could have been \r\n  avoided.\" Id. at 437, 128 S.E.2d at 780. The court added that  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\". . . [c]oncurring causes operate \r\n  contemporaneously to produce the injury, so that it would not have happened \r\n  in the absence of either . . . . It is enough (to impose liability) to \r\n  show that it is a proximate concurring cause; that is, one that was so efficient \r\n  in causation that, but for it, the injury would not have occurred . . .\".\r\nId. at 439, 128 S.E.2d at \r\n  781 (quoting Horne v. Southern Ry. Co., 186 S.C. 525, 538, 197 S.E. 31, \r\n  36 (1938)) (emphasis in original). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Horton court found excessive \r\n  speed was the only evidence of the bus driver's negligence, and concluded such \r\n  evidence, \r\n   \r\nalthough sufficient to support an \r\n  inference of concurrent negligence by the defendant, is insufficient to support \r\n  a reasonable inference that without such negligence the collision would not \r\n  have occurred. Our conclusion does not and need not rest on a certainty that, \r\n  if the bus had been operated at a reasonable speed, the collision would have \r\n  happened anyway. It does rest on the absence of evidence sufficient to raise \r\n  a reasonable inference that it would not have occurred but for the negligence \r\n  of the bus driver, which amounts to a failure of proof of an essential element \r\n  of plaintiff's cause of action.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 441, 128 S.E.2d at \r\n  782. The cases that have relied on Horton in order to find a party's \r\n  negligence was not a concurring cause of the collision have similarly found \r\n  speed to be the only evidence of such party's negligence. Odom v. Steigerwald, \r\n  260 S.C. 422, 196 S.E.2d 635 (1973); Kennedy v. Carter, 249 S.C. 168, \r\n  153 S.E.2d 312 (1967); Guyton v. Guyton, 244 S.C. 357, 137 S.E.2d 273 \r\n  (1964); Alston v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co., 308 S.C. 292, 417 S.E.2d 631 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1992); see also Gunnels v. Roach, 243 S.C. 248, 133 \r\n  S.E.2d 757 (1963) (the collision could not have been avoided even if the defendant \r\n  had seen the plaintiff at the instant he became visible). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThese principles, however, do not \r\n  apply when there is evidence of additional negligence or that speed was a causative \r\n  factor. In such cases, the court cannot, as a matter of law, find no liability. \r\n  See Tubbs by Duren v. Bowie, 308 S.C. 155, 417 S.E.2d 550 (1992) \r\n  (where there was evidence that the speeding defendant failed to take appropriate \r\n  evasive action, liability was an issue for the jury); Wilson v. Marshall, \r\n  260 S.C. 271, 195 S.E.2d 610 (1973) (although decedent was clearly negligent \r\n  in failing to yield the right of way, plaintiff's failure to keep a proper lookout \r\n  and driving at a reduced speed inferred plaintiff's negligence was a contributing \r\n  proximate cause of the collision); Roumillat v. Keller, 252 S.C. 512, \r\n  167 S.E.2d 425 (1969) (the nature of the impact could lead the jury to conclude \r\n  that, if not for defendant's excessive speed, his auto could have been controlled \r\n  as to avoid the collision); Clark v. Cantrell, 332 S.C. 433, 504 S.E.2d \r\n  605 (Ct. App. 1998) (evidence of defendant's excessive speed and recklessness \r\n  supported the jury's finding that her speed contributed to the accident); see \r\n  also Player v. Thompson, 259 S.C. 600, 193 S.E.2d 531 (1972) (where \r\n  there was additional evidence of negligence, dog running out in front of car \r\n  could not be held as a matter of law to be the sole proximate cause of the collision). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis Court may not reverse for failure \r\n  to give a requested charge unless the refusal is both erroneous and prejudicial. \r\n  Clark, 332 S.C. 433, 504 S.E.2d 605. \"[T]he court acts correctly when \r\n  it charges the jury on the law framed by the issues as made by the pleadings \r\n  and the facts developed by the evidence in support of those issues.\" Tucker \r\n  v. Reynolds, 268 S.C. 330, 335, 233 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1977).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere was evidence presented at trial \r\n  that prevents this Court from concluding, as a matter of law, that there was \r\n  no negligence other than Tripp's that caused the accident. The taxi's speedometer \r\n  was inoperable, so Miller could not determine definitively how fast he was driving \r\n  although he admitted to driving at least 60 m.p.h.(5) \r\n  \r\n While traveling on Highway 123, \r\n  Miller passed several cars but neglected to return to the right lane before \r\n  the accident.  \r\n   \r\nMiller admitted he saw Tripp's truck \r\n  in the grassy median of Highway 123, the dominant, four-lane highway, prior \r\n  to reaching its intersection with Fish Trap Road. He acknowledged that he recognized \r\n  at the time that \"any car at Fish Trap Road intersection created a real possibility \r\n  of a big problem,\" but Miller did not slow down. Miller turned to Schumpert, \r\n  who was seated to his right, and said, \"Yeah, that's what he needs to do, is \r\n  just pull out. I need a new car.\" When he \"looked back up,\" Tripp had pulled \r\n  out into the intersection.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMiller testified that, when he saw \r\n  Tripp pull out, he could have pulled into the grassy median to his left, but \r\n  felt he would have \"rolled\" the car. However, Schumpert, who revisited the scene \r\n  after the accident, felt the grass would not have created a problem. The totality \r\n  of the evidence is susceptible of the reasonable inference that there was a \r\n  failure on Miller's part to exercise due care in keeping a proper lookout and \r\n  driving at an appropriately reduced speed under the circumstances, and that \r\n  such negligence on his part was a contributing proximate cause of the collision. \r\n  Furthermore, in closing argument Norfolk Southern asked the jury to consider \r\n  Tripp's failure to yield as the sole cause of the accident, because Tripp pulled \r\n  out so suddenly, Miller could not have avoided the collision at any speed.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is well settled that jury instructions \r\n  must be considered in their entirety. Jones v. Ridgely Communications, Inc., \r\n  304 S.C. 452, 405 S.E.2d 402 (1991) (in order to warrant reversal, refusal to \r\n  give a requested charge must have been erroneous and prejudicial, and the charge \r\n  must be considered as a whole). We have examined the court's charge to the jury \r\n  and conclude that, when viewed in its entirety, it fairly and sufficiently sets \r\n  forth the applicable law in this case. We hold, therefore, the trial court did \r\n  not err in refusing to give the requested instruction. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  LOSS OF CONSORTIUM CLAIMS OF JOANNE DAVIS AND ZAN SCHUMPERT \r\n  \r\n   \r\nJoanne Davis and Zan Schumpert filed \r\n  separate actions against Tripp for loss of consortium resulting from injuries \r\n  their husbands sustained in the accident. The trial court, over the wives' objection, \r\n  sua sponte decided not to submit the claims to the jury. The wives \r\n  argue the court's decision was error because the evidence clearly showed they \r\n  suffered damages as a result of their husbands' injuries. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen this court reviews a grant of \r\n  directed verdict, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-prevailing party. Davenport \r\n  v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  565 (1998). \"If the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, \r\n  the case should be submitted to the jury.\" Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, \r\n  331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRecovery for loss of consortium is \r\n  provided for in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (1976), which states, in pertinent \r\n  part, that \"[a]ny person may maintain an action for damages arising from an \r\n  intentional or tortious violation of the right to the companionship, aid, society \r\n  and services of his or her spouse.\" See also Gosnell v. Dorchester \r\n  Sch. Dist. No. 2, 301 S.C. 21, 389 S.E.2d 865 (1990) (observing that at \r\n  common law, a spouse is entitled to recover the value of the injured spouse's \r\n  services, society, and companionship in an action for loss of consortium).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe wives rely on Page v. Crisp, \r\n  303 S.C. 117, 399 S.E.2d 161 (Ct. App. 1990), to support their position. In \r\n  Page the plaintiff husband brought an action against the appellants for \r\n  loss of consortium after his wife was injured in a collision with the appellants. \r\n  The appellants admitted liability in the accident and a jury awarded plaintiff's \r\n  wife $44,000. The same jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff husband in \r\n  the amount of \"zero dollars.\" The husband appealed the trial judge's refusal \r\n  to instruct the jury after the verdict, to return to the jury room and write \r\n  a verdict in his favor. \r\n   \r\nIn reversing the trial court, this \r\n  court held that the plaintiff husband was entitled to a verdict in some amount \r\n  as a matter of law. The Page court noted that, as in the instant case, \r\n  liability was admitted; the evidence relative to damages sustained by the loss \r\n  of consortium plaintiff was neither disputed nor contested; and the damages \r\n  to which the plaintiff testified were reasonably to have been expected given \r\n  the seriousness of the injuries and substantial damages sustained by the injured \r\n  spouse. We believe, as in Page, that a lack of award to spouses when \r\n  these factors are present creates an unacceptable inconsistency. See also \r\n  Sullivan v. Davis, 317 S.C. 462, 454 S.E.2d 907 (Ct. App. 1995) (reversing \r\n  trial court's denial of new trial absolute motion where wife and injured husband \r\n  had been married for almost forty-four years; wife spent almost fourteen hours \r\n  a day at the hospital for a week, and then six to eight hours a day for two \r\n  months; at the nursing home wife spent afternoons with him; and on his return \r\n  home, wife assisted him in all his daily activities including bathing him, dressing \r\n  him, and caring for his colostomy). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe believe both wives presented evidence \r\n  from which a jury could reasonably infer they had sustained a loss of consortium. \r\n  Schumpert's wife testified that, before the accident, she relied on her husband \r\n  in her everyday activities, with childcare, and for household repairs. Schumpert \r\n  was unable to help her at all for several months after the accident. Davis's \r\n  wife testified his injuries caused their normal schedule to be disrupted, and \r\n  she \"had to wait on him, actually hand and foot\" for some two to three months. \r\n  She added that being out of work was hard on Davis, and he was \"real short-tempered. \r\n  He couldn't, you know, carry on like a civil conversation. . . . [H]e wasn't \r\n  the person he was before.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLoss of consortium encompasses not \r\n  only the loss of services, but also the loss of society and companionship. See, \r\n  e.g., Sullivan, 317 S.C. 462, 454 S.E.2d 907. We think there was \r\n  enough evidence presented to require submission of the wives' claims to the \r\n  jury. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's decision on the wives' loss \r\n  of consortium claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this \r\n  determination.  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find \r\n  (1) Appellants' appeal of the trial court's denial of their summary judgment \r\n  motion in Grosskurth's action is not appealable; (2) the trial court did not \r\n  err in excluding testimony regarding the termination of the employees; (3) the \r\n  trial court's failure to give an instruction pursuant to Horton v. Greyhound \r\n  was not error; and (4) the wives' loss of consortium claims should have been \r\n  submitted to the jury, thus necessitating a remand for trial as to these claims \r\n  only. Accordingly, the judgment below is  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, HEARN and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1.

Appellants \r\n  INA, Charles Duncan, d/b/a Duncan Red Bird Limo, and Leroy Miller joined together \r\n  in their appeal; therefore, these appellants will be collectively referred to \r\n  herein as the \"INA Appellants.\" \r\n3.  Appellants \r\n  rely on Hall for the proposition that a plaintiff is not entitled to \r\n  lost wages based on his former railroad position. We do not read Hall \r\n  to so provide. In Hall, as in the instant case, the plaintiff did not \r\n  seek to recover for wages lost due to his dismissal. The Hall court, \r\n  as do we, affirmed plaintiff's use of his railroad earnings \"as a measure of \r\n  his earning capacity at the time of the accident.\" Id. at 1582. \r\n4.

Pressley filed a petition for judicial review of the Lancaster County Council's \r\n  refusal to issue a Letter of Consistency (LOC). He also filed a petition for \r\n  a writ of mandamus compelling Lancaster County, through its administrator, to \r\n  issue the LOC. The trial court affirmed the County Council (Council) and denied \r\n  Pressley's petition for a writ of mandamus. Pressley appeals. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    FACTS\r\n  \r\n\r\nPressley owns and operates an open \r\n  pit gravel mine in Lancaster County, near the North Carolina-South Carolina \r\n  border. Pressley applied for a permit to operate a construction and demolition \r\n  (C&amp;D) landfill on the property. On July 15, 1996, the Lancaster County Zoning \r\n  Board of Appeals granted Pressley a special exception allowing him to establish \r\n  the landfill. Pressley purchased additional land as a buffer zone, installed \r\n  monitoring wells, and purchased landfill equipment.\r\nThe Department of Health and Environmental \r\n  Control (DHEC) requires an applicant for a C&amp;D landfill permit to obtain \r\n  a LOC from the county prior to reviewing the applicant's request for approval. \r\n  As a last step in fulfilling DHEC's requirements, Pressley attempted to obtain \r\n  the LOC from the Lancaster County administrator. The administrator notified \r\n  Pressley the LOC required Council's approval.\r\nCouncil does not have a written policy, \r\n  ordinance, or other resolution governing the issuance of LOCs. The Lancaster \r\n  County Solid Waste Plan does not require the County to provide a separate C&amp;D \r\n  landfill. The Catawba Regional Plan on Solid Waste Management, which Lancaster \r\n  County joined in February, 1996, recommends the use of a separate C&amp;D landfill \r\n  but does not require it.\r\nPressley presented his request at \r\n  the May 5, 1997 Council meeting. Council recognized it would have to reconsider \r\n  a moratorium it previously placed on the issuance of LOCs. The issues of the \r\n  reconsideration of the moratorium and consideration of Pressley's request were \r\n  placed on the agenda of the next meeting. \r\nAt the May 27, 1997 meeting, Council \r\n  repealed the moratorium. Council then considered Pressley's request. Pressley \r\n  stated the landfill would handle approximately 300,000 tons of C&amp;D waste \r\n  per year. According to the minutes of the May 27 meeting, several members commented \r\n  that Council's decision should be based upon the need in Lancaster County and \r\n  the best interests of Lancaster County citizens. Council denied Pressley's request. \r\n  \r\nPressley requested a reconsideration. \r\n  J. Chappel Hurst, Jr., the Lancaster County Administrator, informed Pressley \r\n  that his request could only be honored if a Council member who voted against \r\n  the LOC moved to reconsider the issue. Although a member asked that reconsideration \r\n  of the denial of Pressley's request for a LOC be placed on the agenda of the \r\n  next meeting, the record on appeal does not indicate the matter was ever reconsidered. \r\n  (1) At the time of Pressley's request, seven sites were seeking LOCs \r\n  for C&amp;D landfills.\r\nOn June 26, 1998, Pressley filed \r\n  a complaint seeking judicial review of Council's decision. Pressley also sought \r\n  a declaratory judgment of the constitutionality of the moratorium and of Council's \r\n  decision. He subsequently filed a petition for a writ of mandamus compelling \r\n  Lancaster County to issue the LOC.\r\nThe trial court found Pressley's \r\n  constitutional argument, that Council's action violated the Commerce Clause \r\n  of the United States Constitution, was without merit. It also noted Pressley \r\n  neither alleged nor proved that The South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management \r\n  Act (2) was unconstitutional. It held Pressley \r\n  was not entitled to a writ of mandamus because Pressley failed to prove the \r\n  ministerial nature of the act of issuing a LOC and the unavailability of any \r\n  other remedy. The trial court found Pressley had not exhausted his administrative \r\n  remedies because he had not pursued a final ruling from DHEC. The court dismissed \r\n  the petition for judicial review and denied the petition for a declaratory judgment, \r\n  an injunction, and a writ of mandamus. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. The \r\n  LOC\r\nPressley argues Council's denial \r\n  of his request for the LOC was arbitrary and capricious because Council did \r\n  not follow its previous unwritten practice or any written criteria. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina Solid Waste Policy \r\n  and Management Act requires planning for solid waste disposal at the state and \r\n  local or regional level. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(A)(Supp. 1999). Lancaster \r\n  County participated with Chester, Union, and York Counties to develop the Catawba \r\n  Regional Plan, which DHEC approved. The Act requires a person to obtain a permit \r\n  from DHEC before operating a solid waste management facility. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-96-290(A) (Supp. 1999). \r\nPermits are issued based on the local \r\n  need for the requested facility and the consistency of the proposed facility \r\n  with local zoning and other ordinances. Accordingly, the Act provides:\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      No permit to construct a new \r\n        solid waste management facility or to expand an existing solid waste management \r\n        facility may be issued until a demonstration of need is approved by the \r\n        department. . . . In determining if there is a need for new or expanded \r\n        solid waste disposal sites, the department shall not consider solid waste \r\n        generated in jurisdictions not subject to the provisions of a county or \r\n        regional solid waste management plan pursuant to this chapter.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(E) (Supp. \r\n  1999).\r\nThe Act further mandates that DHEC \r\n  cannot issue a permit unless the proposed facility \"is consistent with local \r\n  zoning, land use, and other applicable local ordinances, if any; that, eighteen \r\n  months after the date of enactment of this chapter, the proposed facility or \r\n  expansion is consistent with the local or regional solid waste management plan \r\n  and the state solid waste management plan.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(G)(Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\nThe Act does not specify how such \r\n  determinations of need and consistency are to be made. DHEC's practice has been \r\n  to delegate to the counties the authority to determine consistency through their \r\n  issuance of the LOCs. (3) According to the regulation, \r\n  DHEC determines the allowable rate of disposal based on the Region/County Solid \r\n  Waste Management Plans, the LOCs, the facility's design capacity, the expected \r\n  operational life, and the area to be served by the facility as outlined in the \r\n  permit application. S.C. Reg. 61-107.11(IV)(A)(5) (Supp. 1999). Art Braswell, \r\n  of DHEC, stated DHEC essentially delegated the authority to the local governments \r\n  to determine whether the proposed landfills are consistent with the local plans.\r\nBraswell also asserted DHEC believed \r\n  a county's need for a new C&amp;D landfill should be determined by the county. \r\n  He explained, \"As far as whether the need [exists], you're looking at transportation \r\n  cost, amounts of waste generated in the county, whether it's a regional facility, \r\n  things like that.\"\r\nIn requiring an applicant to procure \r\n  a LOC from the host county, DHEC intends for the local government to evaluate \r\n  the same factors which the Act requires DHEC to consider. Although Lancaster \r\n  County has not passed an ordinance outlining criteria for the issuance of a \r\n  LOC, the criteria may be found in state statutes and regulations and in the \r\n  Catawba Regional Plan. As Hurst explained, the county did not adopt a written \r\n  policy regarding the County's determination of need because the requirement \r\n  for need is already set forth in state law and is implicitly part of the local \r\n  plan. \r\nAt the time of Pressley's request \r\n  for a facility with a 300,000 ton capacity, the Mining Road Landfill in Lancaster \r\n  County, an industrial waste landfill in Lancaster County permitted to receive \r\n  C&amp;D waste, had a capacity of 100,000 tons per year of C&amp;D waste and \r\n  of another 100,000 tons of industrial waste. Lancaster County produced only \r\n  3,998.70 tons of C&amp;D waste in 1996. According to Hurst, Lancaster County's \r\n  plan at the time of Pressley's request called for only one facility.\r\nA governmental body's decision \"is \r\n  arbitrary if it is without a rational basis, is based alone on one's will and \r\n  not upon any course of reasoning and exercise of judgment, is made at pleasure, \r\n  without adequate determining principles, or is governed by no fixed rules or \r\n  standards.\" Deese v. South Carolina \r\n  State Bd. of Dentistry, 286 S.C. 182, 184-5, 332 S.E.2d 539, 541 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985). The party challenging a governmental body's decision bears the burden \r\n  of proving the decision is arbitrary. See \r\n  Restaurant Row Assocs. v. Horry County, \r\n  335 S.C. 209, 516 S.E.2d 442 (1999)(stating an applicant seeking a variance \r\n  from a zoning board bears the burden of proof). In light of the Act, DHEC's \r\n  regulations, and the excess capacity existing in Lancaster County, we find Council \r\n  did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in denying Pressley's request for a \r\n  LOC.\r\nPressley also argues Council did \r\n  not follow its prior procedure because Council rather than the county administrator \r\n  considered his request for the LOC. \"The governing body of a county has the \r\n  responsibility and authority to provide for the operation of solid waste management \r\n  facilities to meet the needs of all incorporated or unincorporated areas of \r\n  the county.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(J) (Supp. 1999). As the governing body \r\n  of the county, Council certainly had the authority to consider Pressley's request.\r\nIn addition, Pressley asserts Council \r\n  erred in not following the decision of the Zoning Board. He contends the Zoning \r\n  Board is the only body with authority to approve a landfill. The County's Zoning \r\n  Board has authority to determine land use issues and grant special exceptions. \r\n  The Zoning Board was acting within this authority when it found that Pressley's \r\n  prospective landfill complied \"with all development standards of the Lancaster \r\n  County Land Use Ordinance subject to a C&amp;D landfill.\" However, compliance \r\n  with the land use ordinance is not equivalent to compliance with the Catawba \r\n  Regional Solid Waste Management Plan or state statutes. As stated above, Council \r\n  has the responsibility and authority to provide for the operation of solid waste \r\n  management facilities. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80 (Supp. 1999). Therefore, Council \r\n  was not bound by the Zoning Board's decision.\r\n2. The \r\n  Petition for a Writ of Mandamus\r\nPressley argues the trial court erred \r\n  in denying his petition for a writ of mandamus. We disagree.\r\nIn order to obtain a writ of mandamus \r\n  requiring the performance of an act, the applicant must show (1) a duty of the \r\n  opposing party to perform the act, (2) the ministerial nature of the act, (3) \r\n  the applicant's specific legal right for which discharge of the duty is necessary, \r\n  and (4) a lack of any other legal remedy. Charleston \r\n  County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Comm'n, 336 S.C. 174, \r\n  519 S.E.2d 567 (1999). If the duty to perform the act is doubtful, the responsibility \r\n  is not imperative and the applicant will be left to other remedies. Where the \r\n  duty is not clearly and directly prescribed, the writ will not lie. Id. \r\n  \r\nPressley asserts the only discretionary \r\n  action regarding the landfill was made by the Zoning Board. As stated above, \r\n  however, the Zoning Board's decision was not determinative of Pressley's entitlement \r\n  to a LOC. Council acted within its discretion in determining that Pressley's \r\n  proposed landfill was not consistent with its local and/or regional plans. In \r\n  addition, Pressley's remedy for the alleged wrongful denial was to seek judicial \r\n  review of Council's decision. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err \r\n  in denying the petition for a writ of mandamus. \r\n3. The \r\n  Commerce Clause\r\nPressley argues the trial court erred \r\n  in concluding Council did not discriminate against North Carolina waste producers \r\n  in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. We disagree. \r\n  The Commerce Clause limits the authority of the states to discriminate against \r\n  interstate commerce. New Energy Co. \r\n  of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269 (1988). \"The critical commerce clause \r\n  inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct \r\n  beyond boundaries of the state.\" United \r\n  Techs. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 213, 218, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  901, 904 (1995)(quoting Healy v. Beer \r\n  Inst., Inc., 491 U.S. 324, 109 (1989)).\r\nPressley estimated that at least \r\n  60 percent of the waste he handled would come from North Carolina. At the June \r\n  2, 1997 meeting, a Council member \"pointed out that during the discussion [of \r\n  Pressley's request at the previous meeting], 5 out of 7 members thought that \r\n  most of the debris would be coming from North Carolina.\"\r\nThe trial court concluded Pressley's \r\n  commerce clause argument was irrelevant because Pressley did not argue the Solid \r\n  Waste Policy and Management Act was unconstitutional. Pressley again raised \r\n  the issue in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion. The trial court summarily denied the \r\n  motion. (4)\r\nPressley admits he does not challenge \r\n  the constitutionality of the Act. Rather, he argues Council's denial of his \r\n  request for a LOC was unconstitutional based on Council's improper motive; ie., \r\n  Council did not want to issue a permit to a landfill owner that would accept \r\n  the majority of its waste from North Carolina. \r\nA governmental body's decision on \r\n  the use of land is a legislative function. Hampton \r\n  v. Richland County, 292 S.C. 500, 357 S.E.2d 463 (Ct. App. 1987). Judicial \r\n  inquiry into legislative motivation is to be avoided. South \r\n  Carolina Educ. Ass'n v. Campbell, 883 F.2d 1251 (4th Cir. \r\n  1989). \"Such inquiries endanger the separation of powers doctrine, representing \r\n  a substantial judicial 'intrusion into the workings of other branches of government.'\" \r\n  Id. at 1257 (quoting Village \r\n  of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, \r\n  268 n.18, (1977)).\r\nThe Act prohibits consideration of \r\n  solid waste from jurisdictions outside the plan area in determining need. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(E)(Supp. 1999). Council unquestionably considered Lancaster \r\n  County's needs in denying Pressley's request. Thus, Council followed the dictates \r\n  of the Act when making its decision. In light of Pressley's failure to challenge \r\n  the constitutionality of the Act, we affirm the trial court's ruling that Pressley \r\n  failed to prove a violation of the Commerce Clause arising from Council's underlying \r\n  motives. \r\n4. Exhaustion \r\n  of Administrative Remedies\r\nPressley argues the trial court erred \r\n  in holding he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We agree.\r\nThe trial court held Pressley had \r\n  not exhausted his administrative remedies because DHEC had not ruled on his \r\n  permit application and Pressley had not pursued a final ruling from DHEC. However, \r\n  when Council refused to issue a LOC, the effect of DHEC's policy of delegating \r\n  authority was to deny a request for a permit without further DHEC consideration. \r\n  DHEC's refusal to accept Pressley's application without the LOC was an effective \r\n  ruling on his application. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for Pressley to seek \r\n  administrative review of Council's action. Pressley was entitled to seek judicial \r\n  review of Council's decision. Although we find the trial court erred in this \r\n  issue, this error does not affect our decision on Pressley's other issues. \r\n \r\n   \r\n    Accordingly, the decision of \r\n      the trial court is \r\n    AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n    CURETON, GOOLSBY and \r\n      CONNOR, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.  At the June \r\n  16, 1997 meeting Council voted to amend the County's Solid Waste Plan to include \r\n  a statement of the County's need for 40,000 tons per year of C&amp;D waste. \r\n  It also voted to amend the plan to include a statement of the need for two C&amp;D \r\n  landfills, one each in the southern and northern ends of the County. \r\n2.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-96-10 et seq. (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n3.

Morgan, of Aiken, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    ________\r\n  \r\n  \r\nPER \r\n  CURIAM: A jury convicted Trevis Johnson of possession of crack cocaine. \r\n  Because he had a prior conviction for distribution of crack cocaine, the trial \r\n  court sentenced him to ten years imprisonment, suspended upon service of eight \r\n  years and five years probation. Conditions of Johnson's probation included random \r\n  urinalysis every sixty days during the first eleven months of probation, no \r\n  drug or alcohol use during probation, and completion of a drug rehabilitation \r\n  program while on probation. Johnson timely moved to amend the sentence. The \r\n  trial court denied Johnson's motion, and Johnson appeals. We reverse and remand. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\n  \r\n    DISCUSSION\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn \r\n  appeal, Johnson argues that pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(D) (Supp. \r\n  1999) the court lacked the authority to suspend any part of his sentence and \r\n  order a probationary term. We agree.\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      Section \r\n        44-53-375(D) provides in pertinent part:\r\n      Except \r\n        for a first offense, as provided in subsection (A) of this section [for \r\n        possession or attempt to possess less than one gram of ice, crank, or \r\n        crack cocaine], sentences for violation of the provisions of this section \r\n        [for possession, distribution and manufacture of ice, crank, and crack \r\n        cocaine] may not be suspended \r\n        and probation may not be granted. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(D) (emphasis added). \r\nJohnson \r\n  contends the plain language of this section mandates that an individual convicted \r\n  under this statute for anything other than a first offense for possession or \r\n  an attempt to possess less than one gram must serve the entire court-imposed \r\n  sentence, with no part suspended nor probation granted. The trial court, however, \r\n  apparently relying on its general authority to suspend sentences, suspended \r\n  part of Johnson's sentence and ordered probation. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 (Supp. 1999) (granting the court the authority to \r\n  suspend imposition of sentence for probation except in death or life imprisonment \r\n  cases).\r\nAlthough \r\n  under section 24-21-410 the trial court has the general authority to suspend \r\n  sentences and impose probation, we have already addressed the relationship between \r\n  this section and more specific statutory sections in similar circumstances. \r\n  See State \r\n  v. Taub, 336 S.C. 310, 519 S.E.2d 797 (Ct. App. 1999) (trafficking in \r\n  cocaine); State v. Tisdale, \r\n  321 S.C. 153, 467 S.E.2d 270 (Ct. App. 1996) (driving under the influence). \r\n  In both Taub and Tisdale, \r\n  this court held that the provisions of a specific statute prevailed over the \r\n  general application of section 24-21-410. Taub, \r\n  336 S.C. at 316-17, 519 S.E.2d at 801; Tisdale, \r\n  321 S.C. at 157, 467 S.E.2d at 272. Adopting the analysis used in those decisions, \r\n  we hold that the more specific provision of section 44-53-375(D) controls.\r\nWe \r\n  now turn to the specific language of section 44-53-375(D). When interpreting \r\n  a statute, our primary role is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. State \r\n  v. Baker, 310 S.C. 510, 512, 427 S.E.2d 670, 671-72 (1993). \"A statute \r\n  as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant \r\n  with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.\" Id. \r\n  at 512, 427 S.E.2d at 672. Moreover, words should be given their plain and ordinary \r\n  meaning, and we should not look for or try to impose another meaning. State \r\n  v. Smith, 330 S.C. 237, 240, 498 S.E.2d 648, 649-50 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  Here, the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous: a term of \r\n  imprisonment \"may not be suspended \r\n  and probation may not be granted.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(D).\r\nWe \r\n  read State v. Clifton, \r\n  (2) to be dispositive of the issue before us. In Clifton, \r\n  the appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine and possession with intent \r\n  to distribute crack cocaine. 302 S.C. at 432, 396 S.E.2d at 832. For the distribution \r\n  charge, the trial court sentenced appellant to fifteen years imprisonment, as \r\n  required by statute, even though the court indicated it would not have done \r\n  so had S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (Supp. 1989), not disallowed a suspended sentence. \r\n  Clifton, 302 S.C. at 436, 396 \r\n  S.E.2d at 834. Although appellant argued the statute was ambiguous, this court \r\n  found to the contrary. Id. Citing \r\n  subsection (C), (3) which contained language \r\n  identical to that of our current subsection (D), this court found the trial \r\n  court correctly interpreted the statute to proscribe the suspension of any sentence \r\n  except for a first offense when the amount is less than one gram. Clifton, \r\n  302 S.C. at 436, 396 S.E.2d at 834. Our understanding of this case leads us \r\n  to conclude that section 44-53-375(D) disallows a split sentence as the court \r\n  imposed here.\r\nAccordingly, \r\n  we reverse the trial court and remand for re-sentencing consistent with this \r\n  opinion.\r\n \r\n   \r\n    REVERSED \r\n      AND REMANDED.\r\n    HEARN, \r\n      C.J., ANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n1.  We decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  302 S.C. 431, \r\n  396 S.E.2d 831 (Ct. App. 1990), cert. \r\n  dismissed, 305 S.C. 85, 406 S.E.2d 337 (1991), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by \r\nBrightman \r\nv. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999). \r\n3.

(1) At \r\n  a pretrial hearing, the trial court suppressed Evans's oral and written confessions. \r\n  The State appeals. \r\nWe \r\n  reverse and remand.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nOn \r\n  the morning of March 4, 1994, a fire destroyed the Pageland trailer-home of \r\n  Evans and killed her three small children. Evans survived as she was visiting \r\n  her sister's nearby home at the time of the fire. Later that day, arson investigator \r\n  Terry Alexander of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) obtained \r\n  Evans's permission to search the burned-out trailer, but she refused to give \r\n  Alexander a written statement. An initial test of the site revealed the presence \r\n  of a flammable substance in the debris. Samples were collected for later analysis \r\n  at SLED's laboratory to determine the type of accelerant present at the commencement \r\n  of the fire.\r\n  \r\nAgent \r\n  Alexander did not return to Pageland until after the children's funerals. Around \r\n  lunchtime on March 14, 1994, he attempted to contact Evans at the home of her \r\n  cousin where she had been staying since the fire, but Evans was not there. He \r\n  left word with an occupant of the house to ask Evans to \"come to the Pageland \r\n  Police Department for the purposes [sic] of talking to me about the fire.\" Between \r\n  3:00 and 4:00 p.m, Evans's cousin, Inez Robinson, drove Evans to Pageland's \r\n  police station. (2) Alexander and his supervisor, \r\n  SLED Lieutenant Doug Ross, escorted Evans back to a detective's office in the \r\n  station which they had borrowed to conduct the interview. Robinson and several \r\n  other family members who had accompanied Evans to the station were left in the \r\n  station's waiting room. Robinson asked if she could accompany Evans because \r\n  \"she's quiet,\" and Robinson wanted to be with her, but the officers refused.\r\n  \r\nOnce \r\n  inside the detective's small office, Evans agreed to talk with Agent Alexander \r\n  and Lt. Ross. She told them that on the morning of the fire, she arose just \r\n  before 9:00 a.m., lit a kerosene heater, then left her children asleep in the \r\n  trailer while she went next door to visit her sister. Minutes after her arrival, \r\n  Evans's sister said she smelled smoke, so Evans looked out the window and saw \r\n  her trailer in flames. Evans testified that she rushed back to the trailer and \r\n  attempted to gain entry, but was barred by the flames. When asked what caused \r\n  the fire, Evans opined that it could have been caused by either dogs under the \r\n  trailer, her sister's son playing with matches, or a faulty electrical outlet. \r\n  During the interview, Alexander took notes on a \"Voluntary Statement\" form, \r\n  but he neither asked Evans to read the form nor advised her of the Miranda \r\n  (3) rights contained thereon.\r\n  \r\nAgent \r\n  Alexander testified that although Evans was \"very cooperative\" during the interview, \r\n  she was also upset and sobbing. At times, Evans would speak so softly that Alexander \r\n  could barely understand her. She would also clutch the agent's hands and ask \r\n  him for help. Although Alexander repeatedly asked her what type of help she \r\n  required, Evans never responded with a specific request. Alexander testified \r\n  that he felt the interview was very unproductive and tried to end it on several \r\n  occasions, but claimed that Evans would respond with tears and repeat her request \r\n  for help.\r\n  \r\nLieutenant \r\n  Ross confirmed Alexander's account of the interview. He testified that \"the \r\n  interview seemed to be -- you know -- basically no help at all\" and \"was a very \r\n  long drawn out event\" which lasted two or three hours. Ross also claims to have \r\n  been unsuccessful in ending the interview.\r\n  \r\nAfter \r\n  more than an hour of questioning, the two agents stepped into the hall outside \r\n  the interview room to confer about Evans's statement. Ross testified that he \r\n  suggested to agent Jennifer Edwards of SLED's child fatality unit to \"go in \r\n  and talk to [Evans], see if [Edwards] could - you know - get anything different \r\n  than we already had.\" Edwards testified she spent \"approximately 45 minutes \r\n  to an hour\" alone with Evans trying to comfort her. Edwards maintains she was \r\n  just \"having a conversation\" with Evans the whole time and \"was not on a fact-finding \r\n  mission.\" On at least one occasion, Edwards escorted Evans to the bathroom and \r\n  \"stood outside the door\" because, according to her, she thought Evans may try \r\n  to harm herself. When they returned to the interview room, Evans continued to \r\n  plead for help. Edwards responded: \"Florence, I don't know what kind of help \r\n  you need until you tell me.\" Evans then whispered, \"I dropped a lit piece of \r\n  paper on the floor. . . .I walked next door and waited until somebody saw the \r\n  fire.\" Edwards immediately summoned Ross and asked Evans to repeat what she \r\n  had said. Evans complied. Ross called in Alexander and Evans again repeated \r\n  the statement. As a result, Alexander added another paragraph to his notes on \r\n  the Voluntary Statement form:\r\n  \r\n \r\n   \r\n    \r\n      I \r\n        dropped a lit piece of paper on the floor. I rolled it up and lit it. \r\n        It was writing paper. I dropped the paper on a rug. The rug caught on \r\n        fire and I went out the front door. I went next door to my sisters [sic] \r\n        house and just waited. I waited about two hours until someone saw the \r\n        fire. I got some kerosene in a cup and poured it on the rug. The fire \r\n        got bigger and as I left it was burning a lot [sic]. I was hurting inside \r\n        about seeing people do people wrong. Please get me some help. Please get \r\n        me some help. I lit the fire with a match. I don't remember who found \r\n        the fire. I got the kerosene out of the blue jug and put it back on the \r\n        porch.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  interview ended at 6:01 p.m. Alexander read his notes back to Evans and she \r\n  subsequently signed and initialed the \"Voluntary Statement.\" As a result, the \r\n  officers immediately placed her under arrest. \r\n  \r\nA \r\n  Chesterfield County grand jury indicted Evans on three counts of murder on April \r\n  13, 1994. On May 1-4, 1998, the trial court held a Jackson \r\n  v. Denno (4) hearing to determine the \r\n  admissibility of Evans's oral and written statements of March 14, 1994. During \r\n  that hearing, agents Alexander, Edwards and Ross testified to the aforementioned \r\n  version of events. Evans also testified and offered a slightly different description \r\n  of the interview. Although she acknowledged asking for help and signing a paper \r\n  during the interview, she claimed she thought her signature was required to \r\n  \"get me some help.\" She also claimed to have repeatedly asked to speak with \r\n  her cousin, Inez Robinson, during the interview, but the agents prevented her \r\n  from doing so. \r\n  \r\nRobinson \r\n  also testified. She described how she had attempted to speak with Evans during \r\n  the interview, but was restricted to the station's waiting room until after \r\n  Evans's arrest. Robinson testified that \"[w]hen [Evans] saw me, she just run \r\n  [sic] to me and held me. She said she told them she wanted to get to me. . . \r\n  . She kept crying out to see me. They would not let her see me.\" Additionally, \r\n  Robinson claimed that Evans told her the officers \"pushed her to sign some papers.\"\r\n  \r\n \r\n  The trial court suppressed Evans's oral and written statements to the police. \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA \r\n  criminal defendant is entitled to an independent evidentiary hearing outside \r\n  the presence of the jury to challenge the introduction of evidence \"that was \r\n  allegedly obtained by conduct violative of the defendant's constitutional rights.\" \r\n  State v. Patton, 322 S.C. 408, \r\n  410, 472 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1996) (quoting State \r\n  v. Blassingame, 271 S.C. 44, 47-48, 244 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1978) (citing \r\n  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 \r\n  (1964))); see also State \r\n  v. Patton, 322 S.C. 408, 411, 472 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1996) (requiring a \r\n  criminal defendant to \"articulate specific factual and legal grounds to support \r\n  his contention that evidence was obtained by conduct violative of his constitutional \r\n  rights.\"). Where the State seeks to introduce a defendant's statement into evidence, \r\n  the touchstone of the evidentiary hearing is whether the statement was voluntarily \r\n  produced. State v. Washington, \r\n  296 S.C. 54, 370 S.E.2d 611 (1988). A trial judge determines the voluntariness \r\n  of a defendant's statement by looking to the totality of the circumstances surrounding \r\n  its production including the defendant's background, experience, and conduct. \r\n  State v. Franklin, 299 S.C. \r\n  133, 382 S.E.2d 911 (1989). \r\nCustody \r\n  is not a prerequisite of a voluntariness inquiry, but it is a factor to be considered. \r\n  Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 382 \r\n  S.E.2d 911; State v. Creech, \r\n  314 S.C. 76, 441 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 1994). If the statement occurred while \r\n  the defendant was in custody, then in addition to a voluntariness inquiry, a \r\n  court must ensure the police complied with the dictates of Miranda \r\n  and its progeny. Id.\r\n  \r\n\"Miranda \r\n  warnings are required for official interrogations only when a suspect 'has been \r\n  taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant \r\n  way.'\" State v. Easler, 327 \r\n  S.C. 121, 127, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1997) (quoting Miranda, \r\n  384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966)). Unlike the subjective nature of a voluntariness inquiry, \r\n  custody is determined by an objective analysis of \"whether a reasonable man \r\n  in the suspect's position would have understood himself to be in custody.\" Id. \r\n  at 128, 489 S.E.2d at 621. \r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  this case, the trial court determined that Evans was entitled to Miranda \r\n  warnings because she experienced \"the functional equivalent of interrogation \r\n  and . . . custody.\" Although the court articulated the appropriate objective \r\n  standard of custody, it went on to comment that \"[y]ou have to also take into \r\n  account that she was at the time in her mid-20s, mildly retarded, no evidence \r\n  of any record so, therefore, no real evidence of exposure.\" It is unclear from \r\n  the record whether the court addressed its comment to the objective custody \r\n  determination or the subjective voluntariness analysis. \r\n  (5) \r\n  \r\nIt \r\n  is not the province of a reviewing court to weigh competing testimony and arrive \r\n  at a custody determination. That is left to the trial court. State \r\n  v. Primus, 312 S.C. 256, 440 S.E.2d 128 (1994). Our review of the trial \r\n  court's custody ruling \"is limited to a determination of whether the ruling \r\n  by the trial court is supported by the testimony.\" State \r\n  v.

Madden, of Wilkins &amp; Madden, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, \r\n  J.: Donna Joan Allison \r\n  (\"Mother\") appeals an order of the Family Court transferring custody of her \r\n  daughter, Jessica Lynn Kisling, (1) to Tom Drake \r\n  Kisling (\"Father\"). We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nMother \r\n  and Father were divorced in May 1994. Pursuant to an earlier Family Court order \r\n  and written agreement of the parties, Mother was granted custody of Jessica. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  April 1997, Father filed an action to modify visitation and child support. Father \r\n  additionally requested the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the benefit \r\n  of Jessica. In June 1998, after the guardian's investigation, Father amended \r\n  his complaint to request custody of Jessica, alleging a substantial and material \r\n  change in circumstances.\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\nOn \r\n  appeal from the Family Court, this Court has jurisdiction to find the facts \r\n  in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence. Murdock \r\n  v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999). This tribunal, \r\n  however, is not required to disregard the Family Court's findings. Badeaux \r\n  v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999). Neither are we \r\n  mandated to ignore the fact the Family Court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, \r\n  was in a better position to evaluate their testimony. Smith \r\n  v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997). Concomitantly, \r\n  because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of \r\n  witnesses, it should give great deference to the Family Court's findings where \r\n  matters of credibility are involved. Dorchester \r\n  County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996). This is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best \r\n  interests of children. Id.; \r\n  see also \r\n  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, \r\n  245 S.E.2d 612 (1978) (the welfare and best interests of children are the primary, \r\n  paramount, and controlling considerations of the court in all child custody \r\n  controversies).\r\n  \r\nISSUE\r\n  \r\nDid \r\n  the Family Court err in finding changed circumstances existed that warranted \r\n  the transfer of custody to Father?\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\n  \r\nCUSTODY\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  South Carolina, in custody matters, the father and mother are in parity as to \r\n  entitlement to the custody of a child. When analyzing the right to custody as \r\n  between a father and mother, equanimity is mandated. We place our approbation \r\n  upon the rule that in South Carolina, there is no preference given to the father \r\n  or mother in regard to the custody of the child. The parents stand in perfect \r\n  equipoise as the custody analysis begins. \r\n  \r\nMother \r\n  argues the Family Court abused its discretion in granting Father custody of \r\n  the child. She maintains there was no substantial change of circumstances materially \r\n  affecting Jessica's welfare. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nShirley \r\n  v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000), articulates, \r\n  with specificity, the general rules governing change of custody cases:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    In \r\n      all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the \r\n      child's welfare and best interests. In reaching a determination as to custody, \r\n      the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all \r\n      areas of the child's life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, \r\n      educational, familial, emotional, and recreational aspects. Additionally, \r\n      the court must assess each party's character, fitness, and attitude as they \r\n      impact the child. There exist no hard and fast rules for determining when \r\n      to change custody and the totality of the circumstances peculiar to each \r\n      case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be \r\n      weighed.\r\n    In \r\n      order for a court to grant a change of custody based on changed circumstances, \r\n      the party seeking the change must meet the burden of showing changed circumstances \r\n      occurring subsequent to the entry of the order in question. A change in \r\n      circumstances justifying a change in the custody of a child simply means \r\n      that sufficient facts have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the \r\n      best interests of the child will be served by the change. The change of \r\n      circumstance relied on for a change of custody must be such as would substantially \r\n      affect the interest and the welfare of the child, not merely the parties, \r\n      their wishes or convenience. The circumstances warranting a change in custody \r\n      must occur after the date of the original custody order. Custody decisions \r\n      are matters left largely to the discretion of the trial court. Furthermore, \r\n      the appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation \r\n      of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\nId. \r\n  at ___, 536 S.E.2d at 430 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\r\n  \r\nMother \r\n  and Father have both remarried. (2) While the \r\n  parents' new relationships have impacted this case, the circumstances warranting \r\n  a change of custody began soon after Mother and Father divorced.\r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  Mother's Circumstances\r\n  \r\nA. \r\n  Mother's Judgment\r\n  \r\nMother \r\n  has exercised poor judgment regarding Jessica's best interests and welfare. \r\n  Shortly after her divorce from Father, Mother and Jessica resided with a man \r\n  named Chad Brannon. Mother was not married to Brannon; however, she engaged \r\n  in a sexual relationship with him while Jessica was in the home. Mother testified \r\n  she terminated her relationship with Brannon because she felt \"guilty\" and knew \r\n  \"it was not the right thing to be doing.\"\r\n  \r\nNevertheless, \r\n  Mother again employed a lack of good judgment when she and Jessica moved in \r\n  with Step-Father before Mother married him. Mother testified she thought she \r\n  was putting Jessica first when deciding to live with Step-Father. When asked \r\n  at the custody hearing whether she put Jessica first when she engaged in sexual \r\n  relations while her daughter was in the next bedroom, Mother stated: \"Well, \r\n  I didn't think about Jessica when I thought about sex. So, I feel like I always \r\n  put Jessica first, yes.\"\r\n  \r\nMother's \r\n  imprudent judgment has extended into Jessica's school attendance. Jessica has \r\n  had excessive absences and tardies while in Mother's care. Many of these absences \r\n  and tardies have been un-excused. Mother explained one absence to Father by \r\n  stating Jessica stayed home from school because she had not done her homework. \r\n  At trial, Mother testified some of the other absences and tardies were caused \r\n  by \"some counseling sessions that interfered with school.\"\r\n  \r\nB. \r\n  Mother's Home Life\r\n  \r\nMother's \r\n  relationship with Step-Father is not stable. They have separated twice -- once \r\n  before they married and once after. During the first separation, Step-Father \r\n  attempted to commit suicide. Step-Father has \"flashes of anger and â€¦ uses inappropriate \r\n  words and actions around Jessica.\" Mother has stated she is not comfortable \r\n  leaving Jessica alone with Step-Father because of his temper, inability to get \r\n  along with Jessica, and lack of parenting skills. Mother and Step-Father have \r\n  had many arguments, mostly about Jessica. On one occasion, their argument became \r\n  violent -- Mother slapped Step-Father and the police were summoned. Step-Father \r\n  admitted Mother is \"emotional,\" \"moody,\" and \"high-strung.\" He additionally \r\n  testified she is a loud talker and has a quick temper.\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  addition to Jessica, Mother and Step-Father have two young daughters. The family \r\n  resides in a rented three-bedroom home. Living space is limited -- Jessica and \r\n  Kendall, her oldest half-sister, share a bedroom. At the time of the custody \r\n  hearing, it was the fifth home Mother and Jessica had lived in since 1993. \r\n  \r\nA \r\n  child's regular attendance in a house of worship arguably suggests the child \r\n  lives in a home where moral development is fostered. Regarding the spiritual \r\n  climate in Mother's home, Mother and Step-Father are members of a church; however, \r\n  Step-Father testified the family's attendance \"varies.\"\r\n  \r\nC. \r\n  Mother's Attitude Toward Father and Step-Mother\r\n  \r\nMother \r\n  began exhibiting hostility toward Father when he and Step-Mother began dating \r\n  seriously and got married. Mother's own expert witness, Dr. Joanne Armstrong, \r\n  (3) testified Mother is consumed with anger toward Father and Step-Mother. \r\n  Mother does not handle visitation exchanges well. She has quarreled with Father \r\n  in Jessica's presence, where she called him a liar, cursed at him, and threatened \r\n  to sue him for sexual harassment.\r\n  \r\nMother's \r\n  problems with Step-Mother have also been extreme. Mother admitted feeling intimidated \r\n  by Step-Mother's relationship with Jessica. Mother insisted Step-Mother not \r\n  engage in activities with Jessica such as cooking, fingernail painting, and \r\n  bathing. She once accused Step-Mother of being evil, deceitful, and trying to \r\n  take Jessica away from her. Mother has threatened Step-Mother and once issued \r\n  a trespass notice against her. Based upon this Court's review of the record, \r\n  Step-Mother does not appear to be the source of these difficulties. Mother says \r\n  she is no longer shaken by Step-Mother's presence and influence, but admittedly \r\n  does nothing to encourage Jessica's relationship with her. \r\n  \r\nAdditionally, \r\n  there is evidence that Mother has discouraged Jessica from visiting Father. \r\n  In some instances, Mother emotionally manipulated Jessica by allowing Kendall \r\n  to call Jessica at Father's to tell her she misses her. Mother has attempted \r\n  to limit Father and Step-Mother's access to Jessica at school functions, publically \r\n  insisting Jessica spend time with her rather than them. These episodes clearly \r\n  show Mother is daunted not only by Step-Mother's relationship with Jessica, \r\n  but by Father's relationship with her as well.\r\n  \r\nD. \r\n  Affect on Jessica\r\n  \r\nAlthough \r\n  by all accounts Jessica is a bright child with good grades, the tension between \r\n  Mother's and Father's households has affected her. When Mother is stressed, \r\n  Jessica is stressed as well. Jessica is very sensitive in reacting to problems \r\n  between her parents. She has suffered nightmares, stomachaches, and headaches \r\n  following their disagreements. Father testified Jessica has become upset and \r\n  depressed after she has received phone calls from Mother or Kendall. During \r\n  a counseling session, Jessica described to Dr. Armstrong fun things she liked \r\n  to do at each home, but asked the counselor not to tell the other parent. Dr. \r\n  Armstrong surmised that Jessica is \"very protective of her parents' feelings\" \r\n  and did not want to hurt them. \r\n  \r\nDr. \r\n  Greg Horn, a psychologist appointed by the court to perform psychological evaluations \r\n  on Jessica and her parental figures, reported Jessica, a naturally anxious child, \r\n  has developed \"separation\" problems in being apart from Mother. These difficulties \r\n  are primarily the result of Mother's behavior and the messages Mother sends \r\n  concerning the distress she has in being away from Jessica. Mother has promoted \r\n  this separation anxiety. Mother described visitation exchanges where both she \r\n  and Jessica were crying. Jessica feels the need to take care of Mother and worries \r\n  about her while visiting with Father. \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  Father's Circumstances\r\n  \r\nA. \r\n  Father's Judgment\r\n  \r\nFather \r\n  has exercised better judgment concerning Jessica's best interests. Approximately \r\n  six months after the divorce, Father became acquainted with Step-Mother at church \r\n  and began dating. Unlike Mother, he chose not to expose Jessica to his \r\n  new relationship. Step-Mother recalled:\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n    He \r\n      told me [about Jessica] the very first night we talked. He said that he \r\n      had been in a divorc&eacute; Sunday school and said that I have a daughter \r\n      and she's three years old â€¦. And as we started dating he said, you know, \r\n      she comes first in my life and she's the most important thing to me. So \r\n      I don't - - I've never introduced her to anyone and I'm not going to introduce \r\n      her to you. \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nJessica \r\n  and Step-Mother met only after Father and Step-Mother became serious, which \r\n  was approximately six months into their relationship. \r\n \r\n\r\nB. \r\n  Father's Home Life\r\n  \r\nUnlike \r\n  Mother and Step-Father, Father and Step-Mother have a good and stable relationship. \r\n  They have never separated or experienced marital difficulties. \r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  the Mother's home, Jessica shares a room with one of her half-sisters. She has \r\n  her own bedroom in Father and Step-Mother's new home. Father and Step-Mother's \r\n  schedules permit them to spend much quality time with Jessica. Father and Step-Mother \r\n  are active members and leaders of their church. Father is a deacon in the church. \r\n  Step-Mother teaches Jessica's Sunday School class. They stimulate Jessica's \r\n  spiritual development by encouraging daily Bible reading and devotionals. \r\n  \r\nJessica \r\n  and Step-Mother have a good relationship. Step-Mother testified she has no intention \r\n  of trying to take over Mother's role. Step-Mother is good with children and \r\n  enjoys reading with and telling stories to Jessica. \r\n  \r\nC. \r\n  Father's Attitude Toward Mother and Step-Father\r\n  \r\nFather \r\n  encourages Jessica's relationship with Mother and Step-Father. Father contended \r\n  at trial he does not disparage Mother or Step-Father to Jessica or in her presence. \r\n  He professed he wants Jessica to have a loving and mature relationship with \r\n  Mother and that he does not desire to impede that relationship. \r\n  \r\nIII. \r\n  Guardian ad Litem's Recommendations\r\n  \r\nAlthough \r\n  Dr. Armstrong stated she did not see a need for a change of custody, the guardian \r\n  ad litem appointed to represent Jessica's best interests recommended the court \r\n  transfer custody of Jessica to Father. The guardian averred that in making recommendations, \r\n  he looks at what is in the child's best long term interests. He concluded Father \r\n  has the more stable home and marriage. By contrast, he saw Mother as volatile. \r\n  She treated visitations as crises and thought arguments in front of Jessica \r\n  were \"no big deal.\" \r\nA \r\n  guardian ad litem is a representative of the court appointed to assist it in \r\n  properly protecting the interests and welfare of an incompetent person. Shainwald \r\n  v. Shainwald, 302 S.C. 453, 395 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 1990). The role \r\n  of the guardian in making custody recommendations is to aid, not direct, the \r\n  court. Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. \r\n  401, 505 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1998). The custody decision lies ultimately with \r\n  the Family Court judge. Clear v. Clear, \r\n  331 S.C. 186, 500 S.E.2d 790 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  court accepted the guardian's recommendations and agreed with them. However, \r\n  the Family Court made its own assessment of what was in Jessica's best interest.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nWhile \r\n  in her custody, Mother has exposed Jessica to inappropriate moral surroundings \r\n  and an unstable home environment. Jessica's absences and tardies suggest Mother \r\n  has not prioritized the child's life properly. Jessica has been permitted to \r\n  experience several negative interactions between Mother and Father and Step-Mother. \r\n  Mother has additionally thwarted Jessica's independence and development, discouraging \r\n  her from building relationships with Father and Step-Mother.\r\n  \r\nBy \r\n  contrast, Father has not placed Jessica in any immoral settings. He put Jessica's \r\n  needs before his own when he began his relationship with Step-Mother. He offers \r\n  Jessica a more stable environment than Mother. Father is more capable than Mother \r\n  of acting in Jessica's best interest. He promotes Jessica's independence, while \r\n  encouraging her relationship with Mother and Step-Father. Finally, Father and \r\n  Step-Mother have taken an active role in Jessica's spiritual development. \r\n  \r\nFather \r\n  has demonstrated sufficient facts to warrant the Family Court's conclusion that \r\n  Jessica's best interests will be served by the change of custody. The Family \r\n  Court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, the Family Court's order, awarding \r\n  Father custody is\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n    AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    HEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, \r\n      J., concur.  \r\n    \r\n\r\n1. \r\n   \r\nJessica \r\nwas born December 12, 1991.  \r\n2. \r\n   David Allison (\"Step-Father\") and \r\n  Yvette Kisling (\"Step-Mother\")\r\n were \r\nnamed as third party defendants in this action.  \r\n3. \r\n   Dr. Armstrong is a psychologist who counseled Jessica, Mother, and Father \r\n  pursuant to the court appointed psychologist's recommendation and a consent \r\n  order filed on September 23, 1998. \r\n  Dr. Armstrong testified she did not believe there was a \"substantive \r\n  reason\" for a change of custody. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3278","title":"Brunson v.

We reverse and remand.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThis action arises out of an admitted \r\n  injury by accident Brunson sustained on December 6, 1997, while employed by \r\n  Wal-Mart. Brunson was working in Wal-Mart's maintenance room when a hot water \r\n  tank exploded, causing first to third degree burns to over twenty-seven percent \r\n  of his body. Brunson also suffered visible disfigurement as well as damage to \r\n  his lungs. \r\nAt the time of the accident, Brunson \r\n  was employed by Osteen Publishing Co. in addition to his employment with Wal-Mart. \r\n  (1) Brunson only planned to work at both Wal-Mart and Osteen for a \r\n  brief period of time in order to make extra money over the holiday season. A \r\n  senior at the University of South Carolina, Brunson intended to return to school \r\n  after the holidays and to then work solely for Osteen. At the time of his injury, \r\n  Brunson had already given notice of his resignation to Wal-Mart. \r\nWal-Mart admitted Brunson suffered \r\n  compensable injuries. The single commissioner determined Brunson's average weekly \r\n  wage to be $571.28, resulting in a compensation rate of $381.04. The single \r\n  commissioner arrived at this amount by adding Brunson's wages from Wal-Mart \r\n  ($371.28 per week) to one-half the wage he found Brunson would earn at Osteen \r\n  ($200 per week). \r\nWal-Mart appealed this decision to \r\n  the full commission, contending the single commissioner erred in adding half \r\n  of Brunson's weekly Osteen salary to his average weekly wage at Wal-Mart. The \r\n  full commission affirmed and adopted in toto the single commissioner's order. \r\n  The circuit court affirmed on appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' \r\n  Compensation Commission. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 \r\n  S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). The reviewing court may not substitute its judgment \r\n  for that of the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact, but may reverse if the decision is affected by an error of law. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 1999); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. \r\n  Dist. #3, 338 S.C. 510, 516, 526 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ct. App. 2000). \"A reviewing \r\n  court should affirm a decision by the Full Commission unless it is clearly erroneous \r\n  in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.\" Gray v. Club Group, \r\n  Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000) (relying on \r\n  Lark, 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304). Substantial evidence is evidence \r\n  which, viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the same conclusion that the full commission reached. Miller v. State Roofing \r\n  Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWal-Mart argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in affirming the full commission's decision that Brunson's temporary dual \r\n  employment at Wal-Mart and Osteen was an \"exceptional reason\" justifying deviation \r\n  from the standard method of calculating a claimant's average weekly wage under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999). Wal-Mart also contends that \r\n  even if such deviation from the standard calculation was warranted under section \r\n  42-1-40, the full commission's alternative calculation is unfair to Wal-Mart \r\n  since Brunson did not intend to continue working both jobs after the holidays. \r\n  \r\nThe computation of a claimant's \"average \r\n  weekly wages\" is statutorily determined by section 42-1-40. This section provides \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \"Average weekly wages\" means the \r\n    earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working \r\n    at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately \r\n    preceding the date of the injury, \r\n  . . .\r\n  When for exceptional reasons \r\n    the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such \r\n    other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will \r\n    most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning \r\n    were it not for the injury.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nOur appellate courts have upheld \r\n  the full commission's decision to deviate from the statutory method based on \r\n  the \"exceptional reasons\" language in the latter part of the statute, including \r\n  the circumstance of an employee's dual employment. See Boles v. Una Water \r\n  Dist., 291 S.C. 282, 284, 353 S.E.2d 286, 287 (1987) (\"Generally, . . . \r\n  when an employee works at concurrent jobs, the employee's wages from his multiple \r\n  jobs may be combined to compute his average weekly wages.\"); Foreman v. Jackson \r\n  Minit Mkts., Inc., 265 S.C. 164, 217 S.E.2d 214 (1975) (upholding the full \r\n  commission's decision for exceptional reasons to combine an employee's wages \r\n  earned concurrently from two separate employers in calculating the average weekly \r\n  wage under the statutory predecessor to section 42-1-40); McCummings v. Anderson \r\n  Theater Co., 225 S.C. 187, 81 S.E.2d 348 (1954) (affirming the commission's \r\n  deviation due to the exceptional reason of dual employment under a statutory \r\n  predecessor to section 42-1-40, but limiting its decision to the facts of the \r\n  case); Booth v. Midland Trane Heating &amp; Air Cond., 298 S.C. 251, \r\n  379 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 1989) (finding an employee's substantial salary increase \r\n  over a short period of time was a sufficient exceptional reason to justify calculating \r\n  the average weekly wage at the higher wage rate the employee was earning at \r\n  the time he was injured).\r\nWal-Mart contends Brunson was not \r\n  really a dual employee because he intended to work only for Osteen after the \r\n  holiday season, and that the two-day overlap in employment, coupled with Brunson's \r\n  stated intention not to return to Wal-Mart, is not an exceptional reason sufficient \r\n  to justify a deviation from the standard statutory scheme. In the face of this \r\n  argument, the full commission adopted the single commissioner's reasoning that \r\n  Brunson's employment at both Wal-Mart and Osteen was an exceptional circumstance \r\n  requiring deviation from the standard method of calculating a claimant's average \r\n  weekly wage pursuant to section 42-1-40. We find the commission was justified \r\n  in so ruling.\r\nHowever, we agree with Wal-Mart the \r\n  full commission erred as a matter of law in the method utilized in computing \r\n  Brunson's average weekly wage. Section 42-1-40 \"obviously takes into consideration \r\n  the fact that unusual circumstances relative to employment may occur. An elasticity \r\n  or flexibility is permitted with a view toward always achieving the ultimate \r\n  objective of reflecting fairly a claimant's probable future earning loss.\" \r\n  Bennett&nbsp;v. Gary Smith Builders, 271 S.C. 94, 98, 245 S.E.2d 129, \r\n  131 (1978) (emphasis added) (reversing the lower court's calculation of claimant's \r\n  average weekly wage as a full-time, year-round employee \"as grossly unfair to \r\n  the employer\" since it would require the employer to pay almost twice what the \r\n  employee, who only worked three to four months out of the year, actually earned). \r\n  See Â§ 42-1-40 (\"When for exceptional reasons the [standard calculation] \r\n  would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such other method \r\n  of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to . . . .\" (emphasis added)).\r\nObviously, the amount which Brunson \r\n  would have earned during the holiday season while he was employed with both \r\n  Wal-Mart and Osteen would have been greater than his average weekly wage from \r\n  Wal-Mart alone. However, it is grossly unfair to Wal-Mart to require payments \r\n  based on Brunson's dual employment status since he did not intend to work both \r\n  jobs after the holidays. Therefore, we remand this case to the full commission \r\n  for the purpose of making a factual finding as to how long Brunson would have \r\n  worked both jobs during the holidays. Upon making this factual determination, \r\n  the full commission should reconsider the calculation of Brunson's average weekly \r\n  wage in light of the exceptional reason of his temporary dual employment solely \r\n  over the holiday season. We believe this method of calculating Brunson's average \r\n  weekly wage and compensation rate will bring about a more fair result for both \r\n  Brunson and Wal-Mart.\r\nAdditionally, Wal-Mart contends the \r\n  circuit court erred in failing to remand this case to the full commission for \r\n  sufficient findings of fact. Because the full commission adopted the order of \r\n  the single commissioner in toto, Wal-Mart asserts the full commission failed \r\n  to make a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting \r\n  its findings under Baldwin v. James River Corp., 304 S.C. 485, 405 S.E.2d \r\n  421 (Ct. App. 1991) (reversing the full commission for making only conclusory \r\n  findings of fact instead of providing a specific and definite statement of the \r\n  factual findings underlying its decision). This argument is not preserved for \r\n  our review as Wal-Mart did not raise this issue to the circuit court. Rodney \r\n  v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 517, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996) (\"Arguments \r\n  not raised to the workers' compensation commission or to the circuit court are \r\n  not preserved for appeal.\").\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, this case \r\n  is reversed and remanded to the circuit court for the purpose of remanding to \r\n  the full commission to amend its award in keeping with the views expressed herein.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., dissents in \r\n  a separate opinion.\r\n&nbsp; \r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting): \r\n  I respectfully dissent. The result reached by the majority imposes an improper \r\n  judicial limitation upon S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999) and \r\n  the Full Commission. This decision threatens the right and duty of the Commission \r\n  to factually analyze and apply the statute.\r\nThe procedural posture of this case \r\n  reveals a decision by the Single Commissioner, affirmed in toto by the Full \r\n  Commission, and validated by the Circuit Court. The only issue in this case \r\n  is the interpretation and application of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (1985 &amp; \r\n  Supp. 1999):\r\n \r\n  \"Average weekly wages\" means the \r\n    earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working \r\n    at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately \r\n    preceding the date of the injury . . . .\r\n  When for exceptional reasons \r\n    the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such \r\n    other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will \r\n    most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning \r\n    were it not for the injury. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThis statute squarely places upon \r\n  the Commission the authority to determine if \"exceptional circumstances\" exist \r\n  justifying a deviation.\r\nThe cases of Boles v. Una Water \r\n  Dist., 291 S.C. 282, 353 S.E.2d 286 (1987); Foreman v. Jackson Minit \r\n  Mkts., Inc., 265 S.C. 164, 217 S.E.2d 214 (1975); McCummings v. Anderson \r\n  Theater Co., 225 S.C. 187, 81 S.E.2d 348 (1954); and Booth v. Midland \r\n  Trane Heating &amp; Air Cond., 298 S.C. 251, 379 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 1989), \r\n  are cited by the majority. Consistently, the holding in all the cases is that \r\n  the Full Commission's factual determination of deviation due to \"exceptional \r\n  circumstances\" is a matter left to the sound discretion of the Commission under \r\n  the statute.\r\nThe majority invades the province \r\n  of the Workers' Compensation Commission by injecting an appellate court formula. \r\n  The formula devised by the majority eviscerates the language of the statute. \r\n  I disagree with the mathematical recipe approved by the majority. There is no \r\n  fairness in the judicial windfall bestowed upon Wal-Mart. The majority emphasizes \r\n  the temporal status of the Osteen employment. Such reliance skews the mathematical \r\n  calculation and renders the statute nonefficacious.\r\n\r\n Here, the Commission has exercised \r\n  sound discretion in deciding the factual issue of deviation. I believe it is \r\n  error to conclude as a matter of law that the Commission incorrectly computed \r\n  the employee's wages. I would affirm the order of the Circuit Court. \r\n  \r\n&nbsp; \r\n\r\n1.  According \r\n  to the single commissioner's order, Brunson contends that he began working at \r\n  Osteen on December 4, 1997, two days before the accident at Wal-Mart on December \r\n  6, 1997. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3279","title":"Dodd v.

Pleasant, \r\n          for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: Claude \r\n  Roy Dodd brought an action to terminate a trust he established in favor of Kristen \r\n  Leigh Cook Kerrison in settlement of a civil lawsuit. The trial court terminated \r\n  the trust and ordered the trustee to reconvey to Dodd the real property which \r\n  was a portion of the trust's corpus. The trustee, Bruce A. Berlinsky, appeals. \r\n  We reverse. \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nIn March 1984, Dodd was indicted \r\n  for assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, \r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree, and lewd act on a \r\n  minor. (1) Kerrison was the alleged victim. On \r\n  October 17, 1984, Dodd entered into an agreement with Kerrison's father, who \r\n  was acting on behalf of himself and as Kerrison's guardian ad litem, to settle \r\n  their civil claims. \r\nAs part of the settlement, Dodd created \r\n  a trust in favor of Kerrison. Dodd conveyed three tracts of improved real property \r\n  to the trust, retaining for himself a life estate. He also paid a total of $12,000 \r\n  into the trust in three installments. In addition, he was required to pay $200 \r\n  a month into the trust. \r\nThe trust was to terminate upon Dodd's \r\n  death if Kerrison was at least twenty-five years old at the time. If Kerrison \r\n  had not yet turned twenty-five at the time of Dodd's death, the property and \r\n  funds were to remain in trust until she reached age twenty-five. The trust agreement \r\n  included a spendthrift provision, providing \"[t]he interest of any beneficiary \r\n  in the corpus or income of this trust shall not be subject to assignment, alienation, \r\n  pledge, attachment, or claims of creditors, and may not otherwise be voluntarily \r\n  or involuntarily alienated or encumbered by any such beneficiary.\" In addition, \r\n  the trust agreement stated, \"This trust is irrevocable, and neither the Grantor \r\n  nor any other person shall have the right to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate \r\n  it.\" The circuit court issued an order authorizing and approving the settlement. \r\n  \r\nOn May 17, 1993, Kerrison signed \r\n  an affidavit denying Dodd ever fondled her or attempted to have sex with her. \r\n  She asserted her desire for Dodd to stop paying into the trust and for his property \r\n  to be returned to him. Kerrison, who was nineteen years old when she executed \r\n  the affidavit, stated she signed the affidavit without any threats or promises. \r\n  \r\nAfter Kerrison executed the affidavit, \r\n  Dodd stopped making monthly payments into the trust. At a hearing held pursuant \r\n  to a rule to show cause brought by Berlinsky, Kerrison stated under oath that \r\n  the statements she made in her affidavit were not true. Kerrison explained she \r\n  had made the statements in the affidavit because Dodd was more kind to her than \r\n  anyone, including her family, and she hoped Dodd would respond by providing \r\n  her with gifts, money, and a car as he had done in the past. \r\nThe master in equity decided a ruling \r\n  on the matter based on a motion hearing was inappropriate and a trial on the \r\n  merits was warranted. In view of Kerrison's conflicting statements, the master \r\n  held Dodd would be relieved of making the monthly payments into the trust until \r\n  there was a final decision. \r\nDodd brought this action in August \r\n  1995. The matter was referred to the master in equity for a final decree with \r\n  appeal directly to the supreme court. Dodd failed to subpoena Kerrison, and \r\n  she did not appear at the trial. Over Berlinsky's objection, Kerrison's May \r\n  1993 affidavit was admitted into evidence. The trial court held Berlinsky provided \r\n  no evidence to refute Dodd's testimony or the contents of Kerrison's affidavit. \r\n  The trial court further held that in the interest of justice, the trust should \r\n  be dissolved. Based upon Dodd's request, the court ordered the funds remaining \r\n  in the trust disbursed to Kerrison and the real property returned to Dodd. In \r\n  denying Berlinsky's motion to alter or amend the judgment, the trial court held \r\n  the evidence at trial was clear and convincing that the trust was induced by \r\n  fraud. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Admission \r\n  of Kerrison's Affidavit\r\nBerlinsky argues the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting the affidavit into evidence under the hearsay exception of \r\n  Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, since Dodd did not show Kerrison's \"unavailability\" under \r\n  Rule 804(a)(5), SCRE. We agree. \r\nA trial judge's determination of \r\n  whether a statement is admissible under Rule 804(b)(3) will not be disturbed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. See State v. Kinloch, 338 S.C. 385, 388, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 705, 706 (2000); State v. Prioleau, 339 S.C. 605, 610, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 561, 563 (Ct. App. 2000). Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, provides an exception \r\n  to the hearsay rule for a statement against a declarant's pecuniary or proprietary \r\n  interest, or one that would subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, \r\n  when the declarant is unavailable as a witness. According to the rule, \"unavailability \r\n  as a witness\" includes a situation in which the declarant \"is absent from the \r\n  hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant's \r\n  attendance . . . by process or other reasonable means.\" Rule 804(a)(5), \r\n  SCRE (emphasis added). \r\nThe party offering the statement \r\n  bears the burden of establishing unavailability. Kinloch, 338 S.C. at \r\n  391 n.6, 526 S.E.2d at 708 n.6; Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. \r\n  398, 431-32, 503 S.E.2d 191, 208-09 (Ct. App. 1998). The mere absence of the \r\n  declarant from the hearing does not establish unavailability. Kinloch, \r\n  338 S.C. at 391 n.6, 526 S.E.2d at 708 n.6. Even though in Kinloch the \r\n  primary issue was whether the out of court statement was sufficiently corroborated, \r\n  the supreme court was troubled by the proponent's failure to offer any reason \r\n  for the witness' unavailability and the lack of any evidence of efforts to locate \r\n  the witness. Id. (stating \"some effort at locating the witness \r\n  is necessary\"). The supreme court noted that even though the State acknowledged \r\n  at oral argument it was likewise unable to locate the witness prior to trial, \r\n  the State's concession did not relieve the party offering the testimony of the \r\n  burden of demonstrating unavailability. Id.\r\nAt the hearing, Dodd's attorney stated \r\n  neither he nor opposing counsel was able to find Kerrison. Dodd's counsel explained \r\n  that he had spoken with Kerrison's mother about her daughter's whereabouts, \r\n  but \"[Kerrison] . . . roams, and has no definite place that we could ever locate \r\n  her.\" However, Dodd did not attempt to subpoena Kerrison. After the trial court \r\n  admitted the affidavit, Dodd testified \"I have contact with [Kerrison] all the \r\n  time, but I don't know where she is now.\" In response to a question about where \r\n  Kerrison lives, Dodd said he knew where Kerrison was and explained she was on \r\n  probation and had to report approximately once a week. He also stated she could \r\n  be found in \"two minutes.\" \r\nBerlinsky immediately moved to exclude \r\n  the affidavit based on Dodd's testimony, but the trial court refused. We find \r\n  this refusal to be in error. Although Dodd's attorney claimed he could not find \r\n  Kerrison, he did not try to obtain her presence by process. While Dodd argues \r\n  on appeal that he used \"all reasonable means to contact\" Kerrison, Dodd himself \r\n  testified she could be located through her probation reports. In addition, the \r\n  fact that Berlinsky had been unable to locate Kerrison does not relieve Dodd \r\n  of the burden of demonstrating she was unavailable under Rule 804(a)(5), SCRE. \r\n  We find Dodd failed to meet his burden of establishing Kerrison was unavailable \r\n  to testify. Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting Kerrison's affidavit \r\n  pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE.\r\nII. Termination \r\n  of the Trust\r\nBerlinsky argues the trial court \r\n  erred in terminating the trust, which by its explicit and unequivocal terms \r\n  is irrevocable, based on a finding of fraud. We agree.\r\nAs a general rule, a trust cannot \r\n  be revoked unless such a power is reserved in the trust agreement. Chiles \r\n  v. Chiles, 270 S.C. 379, 384, 242 S.E.2d 426, 429 (1978). However, a court \r\n  in equity can terminate even an irrevocable trust where the trust was procured \r\n  through fraud, undue influence, duress, or coercion. 76 Am. Jur. 2d Trusts \r\n  Â§Â§ 101, 119 (1992). Whether any of these grounds for termination exists is ordinarily \r\n  a question of fact. Id. Â§ 119. As this is an action in equity tried by a master \r\n  alone, this court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, \r\n  775 (1976).\r\nDodd executed the trust as part of \r\n  the overall settlement agreement reached with Kerrison through the offices of \r\n  her guardian ad litem. In return for the creation of the trust, Kerrison released \r\n  Dodd from any and all civil claims she may have had arising from the incidents \r\n  that led to his indictment for the criminal charges. In the settlement agreement, \r\n  Dodd did not admit any wrongdoing. Whether he was guilty of the wrongdoing or \r\n  not is immaterial because, as do many defendants in civil cases, he chose to \r\n  settle rather than risk the unknown.

The Workers' Compensation Commission awarded \r\n  benefits to Miriam Pee, finding her carpal tunnel syndrome to be an injury by \r\n  accident. The circuit court affirmed the award. We also affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nMiriam Pee was employed by AVM, Inc. \r\n  in various capacities beginning in 1987. Each of her jobs involved the repetitive \r\n  use of her hands. In 1992, Pee developed an unrelated cyst in her left wrist \r\n  which was surgically removed. By the spring of 1995, she experienced tingling \r\n  and numbness in both hands, although the symptoms in her left hand and wrist \r\n  were worse than in the right hand and wrist. On April 25, 1995, Pee was diagnosed \r\n  with carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists. The employer was notified of her \r\n  physical condition. On June 16, 1995, Pee underwent \"left Carpal Tunnel Release\" \r\n  surgery. She was authorized to return to work at the end of July 1995. \r\n  \r\nIn January 1996, Pee noticed the \r\n  symptoms in her left wrist were returning, and the symptoms in her right wrist \r\n  were worsening. She returned to her treating neurologist, who removed her from \r\n  work beginning April 20, 1996. Surgery was recommended for her right wrist in \r\n  October 1996, but has not been performed.\r\n  \r\nPee filed her claim for workers' \r\n  compensation benefits on July 21, 1995, asserting she sustained an injury by \r\n  accident from repetitive trauma to both arms while employed at AVM, Inc., resulting \r\n  in carpal tunnel syndrome. The employer filed a Form 51 denying the claim on \r\n  the ground that Pee did not suffer an injury by accident within the meaning \r\n  of the Act. \r\n  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the Single Commissioner \r\n  found Pee sustained a compensable injury by accident to both arms and awarded \r\n  benefits. The employer appealed to the Full Commission on the grounds that Pee \r\n  did not prove an injury by accident and carpal tunnel syndrome should be analyzed \r\n  as an occupational disease. The Full Commission affirmed the order of the Single \r\n  Commissioner, adopting it in its entirety.\r\n  \r\nThe employer then appealed to the \r\n  circuit court, asserting the same arguments. The circuit court affirmed the \r\n  order of the Full Commission. This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\n The issue presented in this appeal \r\n  is one of first impression in this State. See Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., \r\n  320 S.C. 515, 519, n.1, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359, n.1 (1996).\r\n  \r\n The question of whether a claimant \r\n  asserts an \"injury by accident\" within the meaning of the Act is a question \r\n  of law. Creech v. Ducane Co., 320 S.C. 559, 467 S.E.2d 114 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995). This Court may review the Commission's legal conclusion to determine \r\n  if it is affected by an error of law. Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) \r\n  (Supp. 1999). Notwithstanding the scope of review on this legal question, this \r\n  Court must affirm the Commission's factual findings if they are supported by \r\n  substantial evidence and not controlled by legal error. Tiller v. Nat'l Health \r\n  Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 513 S.E.2d 843 (1999). \"An appellate court may \r\n  not substitute its judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence \r\n  on questions of fact unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view \r\n  of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record.\" Id., at \r\n  339, 513 S.E.2d at 845. \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, \r\n  but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.\" Id., at 338, 513 S.E.2d at \r\n  845 (citing Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, 454 S.E.2d \r\n  320 (1995)).\r\n  \r\nThe employer argues that Pee's carpal \r\n  tunnel syndrome is not an injury by accident because it is not unexpected in \r\n  either cause or result, and it has no definiteness in time as to either cause \r\n  or result. The employer contends that this Court should treat a claim for carpal \r\n  tunnel syndrome as an occupational disease, following North Carolina law. See \r\n  McDowell v. Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 181, 41 S.E.2d 872, 876 (1947) \r\n  (\"Our Workmen's Compensation Act having been fashioned to the North Carolina \r\n  Workmen's Compensation Act, and practically a copy thereof, the opinions of \r\n  the Supreme Court of that State construing such Act are entitled to great respect.\"); \r\n  Blair v. American Television and Communications, Corp., 477 S.E.2d 190 \r\n  (N.C. Ct. App. 1996) (treating carpal tunnel syndrome \"injury by accident\" as \r\n  an occupational disease). \r\n  \r\nHowever, unlike the South Carolina \r\n  Workers' Compensation Act, the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act has \r\n  been amended to include a specific provision excluding repetitive trauma cases \r\n  from compensation unless they meet the definition of an occupational disease. \r\n  See N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§97-52 (1999). (1) Consequently, \r\n  the decisions of the North Carolina courts are not helpful.\r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina Workers' Compensation \r\n  Act does not contain a provision categorizing a condition resulting from repetitive \r\n  activity or trauma, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, as a disease or an injury. \r\n  There are some characteristics which are more easily analyzed in a disease setting. \r\n  For example, carpal tunnel syndrome typically occurs gradually, rather than \r\n  as a result of one traumatic event. Other characteristics render it more readily \r\n  identifiable as an injury by accident, such as the fact that it is often attributed \r\n  to repetitive mechanical motion, described as small traumatic events.\r\n  \r\nIf carpal tunnel syndrome is treated \r\n  as an occupational disease, then the claimant has the burden of proving that \r\n  it is \"caused by a hazard recognized as peculiar to a particular trade, process, \r\n  occupation or employment as a direct result of continuous exposure to the normal \r\n  working conditions thereof.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-10 (1985); Mohasco Corp., \r\n  Dixiana Mill Div. v. Rising, 292 S.C. 489, 357 S.E.2d 456 (1987). Of course, \r\n  if treated as an injury by accident, the claimant must still establish that \r\n  the injury arises out of and in the course of the employment. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 1999).\r\n  \r\nAfter careful consideration of the \r\n  statutes and case law, we conclude there is no error in the Commission's treatment \r\n  of carpal tunnel syndrome, where factually supported, as an injury by accident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe begin our analysis by reviewing \r\n  the occupational disease definition found in the Act, keeping in mind that a \r\n  firmly rooted rule of statutory construction in South Carolina is that words \r\n  should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. \"In the interpretation of \r\n  statutes, our sole function is to determine and, within constitutional limits, \r\n  give effect to the intention of the legislature, with reference to the meaning \r\n  of the language used and the subject matter and purpose of the statute.\" State \r\n  v. Ramsey, 311 S.C. 555, 561, 430 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1993). \"Where the statute's \r\n  language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, \r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right \r\n  to impose another meaning.\" Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  578, 581 (2000). The legislature is presumed to have fully understood the meaning \r\n  of the words used in a statute and, unless this meaning is vague or indefinite, \r\n  intended to use them in their ordinary and common meaning or in their well-defined \r\n  legal sense. Powers v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 180 S.C. 501, 186 \r\n  S.E. 523 (1936). Where the legislature chooses not to define a term in the statute, \r\n  courts should interpret the term in accordance with its usual and customary \r\n  meaning. Adoptive Parents v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 543, 446 \r\n  S.E.2d 404, 409 (1994).\r\n  \r\nIn South Carolina, an occupational \r\n  disease is defined as a disease which the employee is exposed to in the workplace. \r\n  (2) As other courts have recognized in construing comparable provisions, \r\n  the definition of an occupational disease is incomplete, and focuses on causation \r\n  while assuming the claimant suffers from a disease. See Duvall v. ICI Americas, \r\n  Inc., 621 N.E.2d 1122, 1126 (Ind. App. Ct. 1993).\r\nAs the Iowa Supreme Court pointed \r\n  out in its analysis of a comparable occupational disease provision, none of \r\n  the commonly understood meanings for the word \"disease\" trace the cause of disease \r\n  to a trauma. See Noble v. Lamoni Prods., 512 N.W.2d 290, 295 (Iowa 1994) \r\n  (affirming carpal tunnel syndrome in claimant's case was not caused by \"an invasion \r\n  of her body by outside agent but by external traumatic forces,\" and was properly \r\n  characterized as an injury, not a disease); see also Duvall, 621 N.E.2d \r\n  at 1126 (\"A trauma is defined as a 'wound, especially one produced by sudden \r\n  physical injury'. . . . Similarly, a 'traumatism' is an 'injury' or a 'wound \r\n  produced by injury; trauma.'\"); Lutrell v. Industrial Comm'n, 507 N.E.2d \r\n  533, 542 (Ill. App. Ct. 1987) (\"[I]njury has its origin in a specific, identifiable \r\n  trauma or physical occurrence, or, in the case of repetitive trauma, a series \r\n  of such occurrences. A disease, on the other hand, originates from a source \r\n  that is neither traumatic nor physical . . . .\").\r\n  \r\nAs the Duvall court noted, \r\n  the term \"'exposure' indicates a passive relationship between the worker and \r\n  his work environment rather than an event or occurrence, or series of occurrences, \r\n  which constitute injury under the Workers' Compensation Act.\" 621 N.E.2d at \r\n  1125. The claimant in that case was found by the Workers' Compensation Board \r\n  to have carpal tunnel syndrome caused by repetitive trauma resulting from the \r\n  ordinary conditions of her employment. On appeal, the court concluded that the \r\n  claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome did not result from \"exposure\" to workplace \r\n  conditions, but from hand and wrist mechanics associated with work on the production \r\n  line. As the court succinctly stated, \"[claimant's] carpal tunnel syndrome did \r\n  not result from where she worked but from the work she did.\" Id. at 1126. \r\n  Noting that compensation for injury in Indiana requires \"injury by accident \r\n  arising out of and in the course of the employment and does not include disease \r\n  in any form except as it results from injury,\" Ind. Code Â§ 22-3-6-1(e) (Supp. \r\n  1999), the court concluded claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome was properly treated \r\n  as an injury by accident, rather than as an occupational disease. \r\n  (3) \r\n  \r\nWe see no reason why, if factually \r\n  supported, carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be compensable as an injury by accident \r\n  under our Act and existing case law. To be compensable under the Act, the injury \r\n  must be an \"injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 1999). To determine whether an \"injury by accident\" \r\n  has been established, the focus is on the injury itself, and not on some specific \r\n  event. Creech, 320 S.C. at 563, 467 S.E.2d at 116. \"'[A]ccident' means an unlooked \r\n  for and untoward event which is not expected or designed by the person who suffers \r\n  the injury.\" Id. It is an event \"not within one's foresight and expectation \r\n  and may be due to purely accidental causes or to oversight and negligence, carelessness, \r\n  fatigue, or miscalculation of the effects of voluntary action.\" Linnen v. \r\n  Beaufort County Sheriff's Dep't, 305 S.C. 341, 344, 408 S.E.2d 248, 250 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991). A slip, fall, or other fortuitous event or accident in the \r\n  cause of the injury is not required. Creech, 320 S.C. at 563, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  at 116. Proof of a \"causative event\" is not required to establish \"injury by \r\n  accident.\" Sigmon v. Dayco Corp., 316 S.C. 260, 449 S.E.2d 497 (Ct. App. \r\n  1994). The unexpected result or industrial injury is considered the compensable \r\n  accident. Creech, 320 S.C. at 563, 467 S.E.2d at 116. \r\n  \r\nThe employer contends that the result \r\n  of the repetitive action in the workplace is not an \"injury by accident\" because \r\n  it is not unexpected. However, there is no finding by the Commission that Pee \r\n  knew she would develop carpal tunnel syndrome if she executed repetitive movements \r\n  with her hands and wrists. There is no evidence that repetitive movements such \r\n  as those made by Pee always result in carpal tunnel syndrome. Furthermore, the \r\n  Commission concluded that the result was not expected, and that fact is supported \r\n  by the record.\r\n  \r\nThe employer has confused the symptoms \r\n  with the injury. The testimony reveals that Pee's carpal tunnel syndrome was \r\n  a condition produced by compression of the median nerve as it travels through \r\n  the carpal tunnel at the wrist, resulting in symptoms of tingling, pain, and \r\n  weakness. Dr. Healy, Pee's treating physician, testified that carpal tunnel \r\n  syndrome results, as a rule, from repetitive stress as opposed to a single traumatic \r\n  event. (4) In Pee's case, Dr. Healy opined her \r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome was work related. Although Pee experienced her symptoms \r\n  for some time during her repetitive work activity, there is no indication she \r\n  expected or intended the resulting condition of median nerve compression. See \r\n  Linnen, 305 S.C. at 344, 408 S.E.2d at 250 (\"accident . . . may be due to \r\n  oversight and negligence, carelessness, fatigue, or miscalculation of the \r\n  effects of voluntary action\") (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nNext, the employer asserts that Pee's \r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome occurred gradually, having no \"definiteness of time.\" \r\n  To support the contention that an injury by accident must have a definitive \r\n  time of occurrence, the employer asserts that no South Carolina case has found \r\n  a claimant's condition to be compensable as an injury by accident without a \r\n  definite time of occurrence. Furthermore, the employer argues that in cases \r\n  involving the gradual onset of injury, such as Stokes v. First National Bank, \r\n  306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991) (involving a stress-related nervous breakdown), \r\n  and Grayson v. Gulf Oil Co., 292 S.C. 528, 357 S.E.2d 479 (Ct. App. 1987) \r\n  (involving hypersensitivity to normal environmental factors from long term exposure \r\n  to petroleum fumes), the forces at work resulted in one catastrophic event, \r\n  which was the single, traumatically induced injury. \r\nWe reject this argument. An injury \r\n  need only be unexpected to be considered an injury by accident. Creech, 320 \r\n  S.C. at 559, 467 S.E.2d at 114. There is no requirement in the Act that it be \r\n  distinct, as opposed to gradual. To impose such a requirement would refocus \r\n  the inquiry on a discrete event, as opposed to the injury itself, in violation \r\n  of Creech, 320 S.C. at 559, 467 S.E.2d at 114, and Sigmon, 316 S.C. at 260, \r\n  449 S.E.2d at 497. In Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d \r\n  639 (1992), our supreme court ruled that the two-year limitation period provided \r\n  in section 42-15-40 begins to run from the date the claimant first discovers \r\n  the compensable injury. It is this discrete event which provides the necessary \r\n  certainty as to time. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude \r\n  the Commission did not err in treating Pee's carpal tunnel syndrome as an injury \r\n  by accident. The substantial evidence in the record supports the Commission's \r\n  decision, and the circuit court correctly affirmed the award. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nSTILWELL, and SHULER, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1. N.C. \r\n  Gen. Stat. Â§97-52 states that an \"accident\" may not \"be construed to mean a \r\n  series of events in employment, of a similar or like nature, occurring regularly, \r\n  continuously, or at frequent intervals in the course of employment, over extended \r\n  periods of time, whether such events may or may not be attributable to the fault \r\n  of the employer and disease attributable to such causes shall be compensable \r\n  only if culminating in an occupational disease mentioned and compensable under \r\n  this Article. . . .\"  \r\n2.  Â§ 42-11-10. \r\n  \"Occupational disease\" defined.\r\n  \r\nThe words \"occupational disease\" \r\n  mean a disease arising out of and in the course of employment which is due to \r\n  hazards in excess of those ordinarily incident to employment and is peculiar \r\n  to the occupation in which the employee is engaged. A disease shall be deemed \r\n  an occupational disease only if caused by a hazard recognized as peculiar to \r\n  a particular trade, process, occupation or employment as a direct result of \r\n  continuous exposure to the normal working conditions thereof.\r\n  \r\nNo disease shall be deemed an occupational \r\n  disease when:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (1) It does not result directly \r\n    and naturally from exposure in this State to the hazards peculiar to the particular \r\n    employment;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (2) It results from exposure to \r\n    outside climatic conditions;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (3) It is a contagious disease \r\n    resulting from exposure to fellow employees or from \r\n    a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed outside of his \r\n    employment;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (4) It is one of the ordinary diseases \r\n    of life to which the general public is equally exposed, unless such disease \r\n    follows as a complication and a natural incident of an occupational disease \r\n    or unless there is a constant exposure peculiar to the occupation itself which \r\n    makes such disease a hazard inherent in such occupation;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (5) It is any disease of the cardiac, \r\n    pulmonary or circulatory system not resulting directly from abnormal external \r\n    gaseous pressure exerted upon the body or the natural entrance into the body \r\n    through the skin or natural orifices thereof of foreign organic or inorganic \r\n    matter under circumstances peculiar to the employment and the processes utilized \r\n    therein; or\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (6) It is any chronic disease of \r\n    the skeletal joints.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-10 (1985). \r\n3.  The Indiana \r\n  view of injury is substantially similar to that of South Carolina. To be compensable \r\n  as an injury under Indiana law, \"a claimant is no longer required to prove that \r\n  his injury arose from an accident as a specific, identifiable event; rather, \r\n  an employee's injury is considered 'accidental' when it is the unexpected consequence \r\n  of the usual exertion or routine performance of the particular employee's duties. \r\n  Either an accidental cause or an unexpected result will support a claim.\" Duvall, \r\n  621 N.E.2d at 1126, (citing Evans v. Yankeetown Dock Corp., 491 N.E.2d \r\n  969 (Ind. 1986)). As stated in the body of this opinion, under South Carolina \r\n  law proof of a causative event is not required. The unexpected result or industrial \r\n  injury itself is considered the compensable accident. Stokes v. First Nat'l \r\n  Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991).  \r\n4.  Carpal tunnel \r\n  syndrome can also be caused by \"a variety of factors, including age, gender, \r\n  weight, acute trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases, \r\n  pregnancy, diabetes, tumors, hormonal factors, and congenital defects.\" 14 A.L.R.5th \r\n  1, 16, n.3 (1993) (citing 8 Am.

Heins \r\n  (\"Wife\") brought a contempt action against her former husband, Donald L. Heins \r\n  (\"Husband\"), to enforce several provisions of their property settlement agreement. \r\n  The agreement was incorporated into the couple's final decree of divorce. The \r\n  Family Court initially held Husband in contempt; however, it reversed itself \r\n  on reconsideration and additionally awarded Husband attorney's fees and costs. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND  \r\n  \r\nIn September 1997, Wife brought an \r\n  action against Husband for divorce. On the day of trial, the parties reached \r\n  a settlement agreement. The court held a final hearing, which included extensive \r\n  discussion on the terms of the agreement. By written order, the Family Court \r\n  granted Wife a divorce on the grounds of adultery. The decree incorporated the \r\n  parties' property settlement agreement. The agreement contained the following \r\n  provisions:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \"Husband agrees to hold harmless \r\n    and indemnify Wife from any debt personally incurred by him subsequent to \r\n    the parties' separation.\";\r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \"Wife agrees to hold harmless \r\n    and indemnify Husband of any debts personally incurred by Donald Heins on \r\n    behalf of Heins Plumbing, Inc. in the necessary and legitimate operation thereof \r\n    disclosed by Husband prior to the final hearing â€¦.\"; and\r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \"Within thirty (30) days from \r\n    the date of this Order, Husband agrees to transfer all his right, title, and \r\n    interest to all assets, both business and personal, including but not limited \r\n    to, the following:\r\n  \r\n  . . . .  \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n   \r\n    e. The business known as Heins \r\n      Plumbing, Inc., and all its assets, tangible or intangible, including, but \r\n      not limited to, its trade name, its vehicles; its tools and equipment; its \r\n      telephones; its facsimile machine; its pagers; its cellular phones; its \r\n      inventory, furniture, and fixtures;\"\r\n  \r\n\r\nSome five months later, Wife petitioned \r\n  the court for a contempt order. Wife asserted Husband failed to: (1) indemnify \r\n  and hold her harmless for $9,477.61 in personal debts he incurred after their \r\n  separation and satisfied using Heins Plumbing funds; (2) disclose to her, before \r\n  the final hearing, additional accounts payable totaling $5,646.21; \r\n  (1) and (3) surrender certain business assets to Wife valued at $4,381.00. \r\n  \r\nAfter a hearing, the Family Court \r\n  issued an order holding Husband in contempt for his willful failure to surrender \r\n  business assets. As a result, Husband was ordered to pay Wife $4,146.00. \r\n  (2) Husband was additionally required to pay Wife $750.00 in attorneys' \r\n  fees. The court found, however, Husband was under no obligation to repay either \r\n  the incurred personal expenses or the undisclosed accounts payable. The court \r\n  reasoned:\r\n\r\n  [Wife] is an accountant, almost \r\n    a Certified Public Accountant, who has access to all of the books and records \r\n    of Heins Plumbing, Inc., and is involved more than most people usually are \r\n    in accounting, [and] could have discovered any possible errors or discrepancies \r\n    of the financial disclosures that she asserted to the Court she had at the \r\n    time of entering into the final consent order and divorce decree.\r\n\r\nWife moved for reconsideration, arguing, \r\n  inter alia, the Family Court erred in failing to require Husband to be \r\n  responsible for his personal debts and the undisclosed accounts payable. In \r\n  his return, Husband denied Wife was entitled to the relief she requested. He \r\n  requested disbursement of his portion of the funds escrowed from the sale of \r\n  real property that was required to be sold pursuant to the couple's settlement \r\n  agreement. Husband did not otherwise seek reconsideration. The Family Court \r\n  denied Wife's motion. As well, the court reversed its prior decision, sua \r\n  sponte, which held Husband in contempt. The judge found Wife's action against \r\n  Husband was based on \"regrets\" and \"dissatisfaction for having entered into \r\n  [the property settlement] agreement.\" The court further rescinded its earlier \r\n  commandment requiring Husband to contribute $750.00 to Wife's attorneys' fees, \r\n  and instead directed Wife to pay Husband $4113.92 for attorney's fees he accumulated \r\n  in defense of the reconsideration motion. Husband was awarded the escrowed funds.\r\nWife again moved for reconsideration. \r\n  That motion was denied, with the exception of a $170.00 downward adjustment \r\n  in the award of attorney's fees to Husband. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nOn appeal from the Family Court, \r\n  this Court has jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with its view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence. Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999). This tribunal, however, is not required to disregard \r\n  the Family Court's findings. Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  835 (Ct. App. 1999). Likewise, we are not obligated to ignore the fact the Family \r\n  Court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their testimony. Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997); see also Dorchester County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 \r\n  S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (because the appellate court lacks \r\n  the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great \r\n  deference to the Family Court's findings where matters of credibility are involved); \r\n  Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 298 S.C. 144, 378 S.E.2d 609 (Ct. App. 1989) \r\n  (resolving questions regarding credibility and the weight given to testimony \r\n  is a function of the Family Court judge who heard the testimony). \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n \r\n  I. Did the Family Court err in \r\n    sua sponte reversing its initial decision that Husband had willfully failed \r\n    to surrender certain business assets? \r\n  II. Did the Family Court err in \r\n    failing to find Husband liable for the personal expenses he incurred following \r\n    the couple's separation and satisfied using Heins Plumbing funds? \r\n  III. Did the Family Court err in \r\n    declining to interpret the couple's agreement as requiring Husband to be responsible \r\n    for business debts he failed to disclose to Wife before the date of the final \r\n    hearing?  \r\n  IV. Did the Family Court err in \r\n    awarding Husband attorney's fees? \r\n\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n I. Husband's Failure \r\n  to Surrender Business Assets\r\nWife avers the Family Court erred \r\n  in sua sponte reversing its initial order following the contempt action \r\n  that Husband had willfully failed to surrender certain business assets. We agree.\r\nIt is well settled that ordinarily \r\n  a party may not receive relief not contemplated in his pleadings. Loftis \r\n  v. Loftis, 286 S.C. 12, 331 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\n  While it is true that pleadings \r\n    in the family court must be liberally construed, this rule cannot be stretched \r\n    so as to permit the judge to award relief not contemplated by the pleadings. \r\n    Due process requires that a litigant be placed on notice of the issues which \r\n    the court is to consider. \r\n\r\nBass v. Bass, \r\n  272 S.C. 177, 180, 249 S.E.2d 905, 906 (1978) (footnote omitted). \r\nThe Family Court found Husband in \r\n  contempt because he did not relinquish $4,146.00 in business assets to Wife. \r\n  Husband was mandated to pay Wife this amount. Husband did not make a request \r\n  to alter or amend this decision. Moreover, neither Wife's subsequent Rule 59(e), \r\n  SCRCP motion nor Husband's reply can be read to have brought this issue before \r\n  the court for reconsideration. \r\nWhile much has been written about \r\n  the propriety of courts ruling on issues included in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion, \r\n  but not raised at trial, a review of cases decided since the enactment of the \r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure reveals little comment on the permissibility \r\n  of a trial court altering or amending an order on its own initiative. Because \r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP is substantially the federal rule, (3) \r\n  an examination of authorities addressing this dilemma, as it pertains to the \r\n  federal courts, is appropriate. A leading treatise on federal practice elucidates:\r\n\r\n  Rule 59(e) is silent on the power \r\n    of a court to alter or amend a judgment on its own initiative, \r\n    unlike Rule 59(d), which authorizes the court to grant a new trial on its \r\n    own initiative. It is unclear whether or not a court has this \r\n    authority. Arguably, a court should have the power to alter or amend a judgment \r\n    on its own motion, as long as it acts no later than 10 days after the entry \r\n    of the judgment. The authorization in Rule 59(d) (and Rule 60(a)) for the \r\n    court to act on its own initiative has been held to be only \r\n    a declaratory example of the general power of a court to act on its own \r\n    initiative in many respects. However, when the court acts on its own \r\n    initiative, the court must act within 10 days of the entry of judgment.\r\n\r\nIn Burnam v. Amoco Container Company, \r\n  738 F.2d 1230 (11th Cir. 1984), an employee of Amoco filed a complaint against \r\n  the company, alleging she was a victim of age discrimination. Amoco filed its \r\n  answer and a motion to dismiss. The employee in turn filed a response to Amoco's \r\n  motion. Soon thereafter, the federal district court issued an order dismissing \r\n  the employee's complaint. No additional motions or other documents of any nature \r\n  were filed by either party after the trial court's order. Nonetheless, 10 days \r\n  later, the district court, on its own volition, entered another order, explaining \r\n  that it had not received the employee's response to Amoco's motion to dismiss \r\n  until after the initial order was entered. The court further stated: \"[t]he \r\n  court has now considered the plaintiff's arguments in opposition to the motion \r\n  to dismiss and finds them to be without merit. The court's [initial] order â€¦ \r\n  remains the order of this court. The instant order is issued as a clarification \r\n  of the grounds set forth in the previous order.\" Id. at 1231. On appeal, the \r\n  Eleventh Circuit was faced with the question of whether, pursuant to Rule 59(e), \r\n  the trial court had the power to amend its initial judgment, sua sponte. \r\n  The appellate tribunal responded:\r\n\r\n  The Rules of Civil Procedure are \r\n    unclear [regarding whether a district court may, sua sponte, consider \r\n    the availability of Rule 59(e) relief]. For example, Rule 60(a) authorizes \r\n    the court to correct clerical mistakes and other errors on its own initiative. \r\n    Likewise, Rule 59(d) states that a court may grant a new trial on its own \r\n    initiative. In contrast, Rule 59(e) is silent on the power of the court to \r\n    order relief on its own initiative. Arguably, such silence implies that the \r\n    court lacks such power. We decline to make such an inference â€¦. Thus, so long \r\n    as the court acts within ten days after the entry of judgment, the court has \r\n    the power on its own motion to consider altering or amending a judgment â€¦.\r\n\r\nId. at 1232.\r\nThe Burnam holding has been \r\n  recognized and applied on numerous occasions. E.g., Continental Lab. Prods., \r\n  Inc. v. Medax Int'l., Inc., 114 F. Supp. 2d 992 (S.D.Cal. 2000); Marshall \r\n  v. Shalala, 5 F.3d 453 (10th Cir. 1993); Useden v. Acker, 947 F.2d \r\n  1563 (11th Cir. 1991). \r\nIn addition to Burnam, this \r\n  Court finds Hidle v. Geneva County Board of Education, 792 F.2d 1098 \r\n  (11th Cir. 1986), edifying. Hidle filed suit in federal district court, alleging \r\n  the Geneva County Board of Education had established a pattern and practice \r\n  of favoring males over females in its hiring for supervisory and administrative \r\n  positions, which resulted in the school board denying employment to Hidle, a \r\n  female. After trial, the court issued a written opinion that asseverated the \r\n  school board had violated federal law by refusing to hire Hidle for an assistant \r\n  principal's position because of her sex. Regarding damages, the court did not \r\n  grant Hidle her request for back-pay; however, it did order the school district \r\n  to offer Hidle the next vacant assistant principalship. Hidle timely filed a \r\n  motion to alter and amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e). She raised only \r\n  the questions of back-pay and the court's failure to require her immediate instatement \r\n  into the job she was originally denied. The school board filed no post-judgment \r\n  motion requesting alteration or amendment. The district court subsequently denied \r\n  Hidle's motion, set aside its order, and entered an amended judgment in favor \r\n  of the school district. The time period between the initial judgment and the \r\n  second order was seven months. \r\nAt issue on appeal was whether a \r\n  party's motion to alter or amend a judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) permits the \r\n  trial court, sua sponte, to vacate a judgment in favor of the moving \r\n  party so as to rule in favor of the non-moving party:\r\n \r\n  Strong policy considerations militate \r\n    against what occurred here. The court â€¦ arguably erred in denying [back-pay], \r\n    job instatement, and injunctive relief against future discrimination, as well \r\n    as in assigning the burden of proof of mitigation. When plaintiff sought to \r\n    present these matters as a basis for altering or amending the remedies afforded \r\n    her, she lost her judgment to the defendant who had not asked any post-judgment \r\n    relief. This inhibits the error-correcting function of a Rule 59(e) motion. \r\n    If the district court is correct, a successful plaintiff given a less-than-complete \r\n    remedy could not ask for correction without putting at risk the judgment in \r\n    her favor though the party cast in judgment has raised no question of the \r\n    validity of the judgment. A defendant successful on five claims cannot safely \r\n    seek for correction concerning claim six.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  The lapse of time is of real concern. \r\n    This court has held, in Burnam v. Amoco â€¦ that where no motion has \r\n    been filed by either party[,] a district court has a limited power to act \r\n    sua sponte to alter or amend a judgment so long as done within ten days after \r\n    the judgment is entered. If Burnam controls, the district court here exceeded \r\n    its authority because of the â€¦ delay. Here a motion was made by plaintiff. \r\n    Possibly the filing of a motion by a party opens up the judgment to a greater \r\n    extent than the court itself can open it up without a motion. Nevertheless, \r\n    the interest of the parties and society in the finality of judgments, and \r\n    the legitimate expectation of the parties concerning the judgment to the extent \r\n    it is not questioned by the parties, speak against pulling the rug from under \r\n    the plaintiff [seven] months after she filed her motion to correct errors \r\n    in the remedy granted her. \r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 1100. \r\nA recent case decided by our Supreme \r\n  Court, Leviner v. Sonoco Products Company, 339 S.C. 492, 530 S.E.2d 127 \r\n  (2000), lends support to the proposition that a trial judge may alter or amend \r\n  a judgment, sua sponte, but must do so within 10 days after the judgment \r\n  was entered. Leviner was a workers' compensation case. In that dispute, \r\n  the single commissioner found Leviner had reached maximum medical improvement \r\n  and awarded him permanent disability. The full commission affirmed. Leviner \r\n  appealed to the Circuit Court, which issued a form order, remanding the case \r\n  to the single commissioner. Neither party filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion within \r\n  the 10-day period allowed by the rule. A month later, the Circuit Court entered \r\n  a full written order purporting to vacate the commission's orders and finding \r\n  Leviner totally disabled. Sonoco appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed the \r\n  second order, holding the Circuit Court exceeded its appellate jurisdiction \r\n  in finding Leviner totally disabled. The matter was remanded to the single commissioner \r\n  for a de novo hearing, pursuant to the initial form order. Upon its review, \r\n  the Supreme Court concluded the second order was void:\r\n\r\n  [T]he trial judge's full written \r\n    order filed â€¦ more than thirty days later, was patently untimely. Under Rule \r\n    59(e), SCRCP, trial judge has only ten days from entry of judgment to alter \r\n    or amend an earlier order on his own initiative â€¦. When no timely Rule 59 \r\n    motion was made nor timely sua sponte order filed under Rule 59(e), \r\n    the â€¦ form order \"matured\" into a final judgment. The [subsequent] order â€¦ \r\n    was a nullity because the trial judge no longer had jurisdiction over the \r\n    matter.\r\n\r\nId. at 494, 530 S.E.2d at \r\n  128.\r\nThe Leviner holding was founded \r\n  in large part upon the Supreme Court's ruling in Doran v. Doran, 288 \r\n  S.C. 477, 343 S.E.2d 618 (1986). Doran was a domestic relations case. \r\n  In his petition for divorce, Husband sought equitable distribution of the marital \r\n  assets. Wife listed a savings account on her financial declaration. In his final \r\n  order, the trial judge divided the parties' various real and personal property, \r\n  but did not expressly mention the savings account. Neither party appealed the \r\n  order. More than a month later, the judge, on his own volition, issued a supplemental \r\n  order reserving jurisdiction to divide the savings account. After a hearing, \r\n  the judge awarded 57% of the savings account to Husband. This case was heard \r\n  before the promulgation of Rule 59(e), SCRCP; nevertheless, Chief Justice Ness, \r\n  writing for a unanimous Court, declared a trial court's authority to alter or \r\n  amend its decision, sua sponte, was \r\ntime-limited:\r\n\r\n  A trial judge loses jurisdiction \r\n    to modify an order after the term at which it is issued â€¦. Once the term ends, \r\n    the order is no longer subject to any amendment or modification which involves \r\n    the exercise of judgment or discretion on the merits of the action. \r\n    (4)\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 478, 343 S.E.2d 619 (citations omitted). \r\nWe rule a Family Court judge does \r\n  not have the authority to alter or amend a judgment, sua sponte, once \r\n  the judgment is more than 10-days-old. In the case sub judice, the order \r\n  addressing Wife's contempt motion was filed January 29, 1999. On June 3, 1999, \r\n  the Family Court entered its order in response to Wife's first reconsideration \r\n  motion. The interim between these orders clearly exceeded the 10-day period \r\n  permitted by Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Therefore, the Family Court's grant of relief \r\n  to Husband from his obligation to Wife regarding the business assets is reversed. \r\n  \r\nII. Personal Expenses \r\n  in the Amount of $9,477.61\r\nWife asserts the Family Court erred \r\n  in failing to find Husband liable for the $9,477.61 in personal expenses he \r\n  incurred following the couple's separation and satisfied using Heins Plumbing \r\n  funds. We agree.\r\n\r\n  The parties' agreement enunciated:\r\n  Husband agrees to hold harmless \r\n    and indemnify Wife from any debt personally incurred by him subsequent to \r\n    the parties' separation.\r\n\r\nThe parties separated on August 14, \r\n  1997. The report of Husband's accountant identified $9,477.61 in personal debt \r\n  incurred by Husband after the parties separated, including attorney's fees and \r\n  costs, which Husband paid from the Heins Plumbing account. \r\nUnambiguous marital agreements will \r\n  be enforced according to their terms. Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, \r\n  491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997). Where an agreement is clear and capable of legal \r\n  interpretation, the court's only function is to interpret its lawful meaning, \r\n  discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give \r\n  effect to it. Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 465 S.E.2d 121 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995). The court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, \r\n  regardless of the contract's wisdom or folly, or the parties' failure to guard \r\n  their rights carefully. Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 449 S.E.2d 487 \r\n  (1994). To discover the intention of a contract, the court must first look to \r\n  its language -- if the language is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, \r\n  it alone determines the document's force and effect. Superior Auto. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 199 S.E.2d 719 (1973); see also McPherson \r\n  v. J.E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183, 33 S.E.2d 501(1945) (the court \r\n  cannot read words into a contract that import an intent wholly unexpressed when \r\n  the contract was executed); Stewart v. Morris, 84 S.C. 148, 65 S.E. 1044 \r\n  (1909) (the court must interpret language in its natural and ordinary sense, \r\n  except where technical language or the context requires another meaning). \r\nIn his brief, Husband does not contest \r\n  the personal nature of the expenses at issue. Neither does he argue the debts \r\n  were necessary to the operation of the business. Rather, Husband asserts Wife \r\n  did not incur any loss or damage to a third party due to his actions; thus, \r\n  his duty to indemnify her was not triggered. We reject this argument. \r\nThis Court finds the agreement unambiguously \r\n  holds Husband solely accountable for the personal debts he incurred after the \r\n  parties' separation. The agreement is clear and capable of only one legal interpretation, \r\n  i.e., husband is liable for the personal expenses paid from Heins Plumbing funds. \r\n  Under separate provisions of the agreement, Husband was obligated to surrender \r\n  all Heins Plumbing assets to Wife. His draining of corporate funds to pay his \r\n  personal debts diminished the value of the assets that were to be transferred. \r\n  Such activity was inequitable. Accordingly, we hold Husband must pay Wife $9,477.61 \r\n  for the personal expenses he impermissibly appropriated from Heins Plumbing. \r\n  \r\nIII. Husband's \r\n  Failure to Disclose All Business Debts Before \r\n  Date of Final Hearing \r\nWife maintains the Family Court erred \r\n  in declining to interpret the property settlement agreement as requiring Husband \r\n  to be responsible for business debts he failed to disclose before the date of \r\n  the final hearing. We agree.\r\n\r\n  The parties' agreement specifically \r\n    provides:\r\n  Wife agrees to hold harmless and \r\n    indemnify Husband of any debts personally incurred by Donald Heins on behalf \r\n    of Heins Plumbing, Inc., in the necessary and legitimate operation thereof \r\n     disclosed by Husband prior to the final hearing.\" \r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nIn June 1998, Husband had an accountant \r\n  prepare a financial statement, which showed $11,378.85 in current liabilities \r\n  at Heins Plumbing. Wife relied on the accuracy of this statement in entering \r\n  into the parties' settlement agreement. When Wife assumed control over the business \r\n  after the final hearing, she learned the financials failed to reveal an additional \r\n  $5,486.29 in debts.\r\n The provision obligating Wife to \r\n  pay the disclosed debts is, in our view, rendered meaningless unless it is read \r\n  to infer the complimentary measure -- Husband will be held responsible for any \r\n  undisclosed obligations. Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 324 S.C. 570, 582, 479 \r\n  S.E.2d 510, 516 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"[T]he law will imply consistent terms into \r\n  a contract if reason, justice, honesty, or fairness would lead a court to believe \r\n  that the parties omitted the implied terms.\") (citing Southern Realty and \r\n  Constr. Co. v. Bryan, 290 S.C. 302, 350 S.E.2d 194 (Ct. App. 1986)). Clearly, \r\n  the purpose of the disclosure provision is to allocate all business debts between \r\n  the parties, with Wife ultimately responsible for all disclosed legitimate business \r\n  debts. \r\nWe reject Husband's argument Wife \r\n  waived any right she may have had to complain about the undisclosed debts by \r\n  her failure to discover them before entering into the agreement. The requirement \r\n  that Husband disclose all business debts before the final hearing was not conditioned \r\n  on Wife's independent discovery. Rather, Husband had an absolute affirmative \r\n  duty to inform Wife of all business debts he incurred prior to the final hearing, \r\n  notwithstanding Wife's pursuits into investigating the books.\r\nIV. Family Court's \r\n  Award of Attorney's Fees to Husband\r\nWife contends the Family Court erred \r\n  in awarding Husband attorney's fees. We agree.\r\nIn determining whether to award attorney's \r\n  fees, the court should consider: each party's ability to pay his or her own \r\n  fees; the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the parties' respective \r\n  financial conditions; and the effect of the attorney's fee on each party's standard \r\n  of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992); Doe \r\n  v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 478 S.E.2d 854 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nIn light of our disposition of the \r\n  merits of this appeal, which has negated any beneficial results obtained by \r\n  Husband's counsel at the trial court level, an award of attorney's fees to Husband \r\n  is not warranted.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold a Family Court judge does \r\n  not have the jurisdiction to alter or amend a judgment, sua sponte, when more \r\n  than 10 days have elapsed since the judgment's entry by the clerk of court. \r\n  In the instant case, the Family Court, on its own initiative, reversed its contempt \r\n  order regarding Husband's wilful failure to transfer certain business assets \r\n  to Wife in a subsequent decision more than five months later. The court undeniably \r\n  surpassed the 10-day limitation; therefore, the latter determination regarding \r\n  the business assets is invalid. \r\nA property settlement agreement between \r\n  a divorcing husband and wife is a contract. The rules that govern the interpretation \r\n  and enforcement of contracts are therefore in force. It is well-settled that \r\n  an unambiguous contract must be applied by the courts pursuant to the agreement's \r\n  terms. In the instant case, Husband and Wife clearly agreed, without condition, \r\n  that: Husband would transfer his interest in Heins Plumbing's assets to Wife; \r\n  Wife would be indemnified by Husband for any personal debt he incurred after \r\n  their separation; and Wife would assume all liabilities Husband undertook on \r\n  behalf of Heins Plumbing, provided he disclosed the debts to Wife before the \r\n  date of the final hearing. Husband is required to immediately remit $19,859.90 \r\n  to Wife. (5) Accordingly, the Family Court's \r\n  post-divorce decree determinations that granted Husband an award of attorney's \r\n  fees and costs and absolved him from his obligations to pay his personal expenditures, \r\n  undisclosed business debts, and the value of the untransferred business assets \r\n  are\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., \r\n  concur.\r\n&nbsp; \r\n 1.  In an amended \r\n  affidavit supporting her contempt motion, Wife claimed Husband had failed to \r\n  show an additional $5,646.21 in accounts payable before the date of the final \r\n  hearing. Nevertheless, during the contempt hearing, Wife stipulated the sum \r\n  was $5,486.29. Her brief to this Court continues to refer to $5,486.29 as the \r\n  undisclosed amount. \r\n  Husband provided a financial statement \r\n  from his accountant the month of the final hearing that detailed the financial \r\n  status of Heins Plumbing. Husband's accounting revealed $11,378.85 in accounts \r\n  payable. When Wife assumed control of the business following the final hearing, \r\n  she discovered the accounts payable were actually $16,865.14.  \r\n2.  Wife \r\n  initially valued the untransferred business assets at $4,381.00; however, this \r\n  valuation was revised at the contempt hearing and established as $4,146.00. \r\n   \r\n3.  25 S.C. Juris. \r\n   Rules of Civil Procedure \r\n  Â§ 59.1 (1994)  \r\n4.  In \r\n  a footnote, the Court noted that under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which was enacted \r\n  in the time between the initial proceedings and the appeal, the trial judge \r\n  would have had the authority to alter or amend the order, but only for a 10-day \r\n  period after entry of the judgment.  \r\n5.

Mikell, of Florence; and H. Mac Tyson, II, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, for appellant.\r\n\r\nGus C. Smith, of the South Carolina Department of Social Services, of Conway, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Larry B. Basnight appeals from an order of the family court adjudicating him the father of a minor child and\r\nawarding child support.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n\r\n\r\nHelen Point is the natural mother of the minor child, the subject of this action.  In January of 1986, the mother initiated an\r\naction in South Carolina, pursuant to the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (the Act), (1) to establish support for\r\nthe minor child, born December 14, 1984.\r\n\r\nThe State of North Carolina, as the responding state, proceeded with the action pursuant to the Act and Basnight was notified to\r\nappear before a North Carolina district court.  On April 11, 1986, the State of North Carolina filed a voluntary dismissal of the\r\naction because it had information that Point no longer lived in South Carolina.  Point, however, did still reside in South\r\nCarolina and the State of North Carolina thereafter filed a motion to reopen the case, which was granted.  Basnight filed a\r\nmotion to dismiss the action, which was denied.\r\n\r\nBasnight appealed this denial and, by order dated July 6, 1987, the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the\r\naction to the trial court on the ground that \"a party cannot make any motions, and the court cannot enter any order, in a cause\r\nafter a voluntary dismissal has been taken in the cause.\"  On remand, the North Carolina district court dismissed the case with\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1994,  the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS), as assignee of support payments due the child,\r\ninstituted this action against Basnight in South Carolina.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, personal jurisdiction over Basnight,\r\na resident of Texas, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated Section 20-7-953(A)(1985).\r\n\r\nBy amended answer, Basnight denied DSS's allegations as to personal jurisdiction, and asserted the claim was barred by the\r\ndoctrine of res judicata.  Basnight also filed a motion to dismiss for, among other things, lack of personal jurisdiction.  After a\r\nDecember 7, 1994 hearing, the family court denied the motion to dismiss.  Basnight filed \"exceptions\" to the order with the\r\nfamily court, objecting to \"any and all findings of fact, conclusions of law, [and] the entry and signing of a 'Final Order.'\"\r\nThe family court held a hearing on the exceptions and reaffirmed the prior order denying Basnight's motion to dismiss. \r\nBasnight filed an appeal, which was dismissed by our Supreme Court as an unappealable interlocutory order.\r\n\r\nFollowing a hearing on the merits, the family court issued its final order concluding Basnight was the natural father of the\r\nminor child, and establishing his child support obligation at $474.09 per month.  The court found the support obligation should\r\nbe made retroactive to the date of the December 7, 1994 hearing, and thereby established Basnight's arrearage at $22,282.23, to\r\nbe repaid at a rate of $25.00 per week.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Jurisdiction (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasnight argues the family court should have dismissed the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nThe party seeking to invoke personal jurisdiction against a nonresident defendant via a long-arm statute has the burden of\r\nestablishing jurisdiction.  White v. Stephens, 300 S.C. 241, 387 S.E.2d 260 (1990).  The determination of whether a trial court\r\nmay exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant involves a two step analysis.\r\nId.  First, the defendant's conduct\r\nmust meet the requirements of the applicable long-arm statute. Id.  Second, the defendant must have sufficient contacts with\r\nSouth Carolina so that the constitutional standards of due process are not violated.\r\nId. \r\n\r\nLong-Arm Statute\r\n\r\nWe find Basnight's conduct met the requirements of the long-arm statute applied by the family court.  The family court\r\nexercised personal jurisdiction over Basnight pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated Section 20-7-953(A) (1985).  Section\r\n20-7-953(A) provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nAny person who has sexual intercourse in this State thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to an action\r\nbrought under this subarticle with respect to a child who may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-953(A)(1985).  The mother testified she and Basnight had sexual intercourse in South Carolina the\r\nweekend of March 16, 1984, which resulted in the conception of the minor child.\r\n\r\nBasnight argues the long-arm statute does not apply as it was not enacted until after the date of the minor child's conception. \r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 20-7-953(A) became effective on March 22, 1984, approximately six days after the minor child's conception.  See\r\n1984 Act No. 307, Â§ 1.  In Thompson v. Hofmann, our Supreme Court considered the application of a long-arm statute to\r\nactions commenced after the passage of the statute. Thompson, 263 S.C. 314, 210 S.E.2d 461 (1974).  Distinguishing long-arm\r\nstatutes from implied consent statutes, the court concluded the long-arm statute applied \"regardless of when the cause of action\r\nmay have arisen.\" Id. at 320, 210 S.E.2d at 463.\r\nSee E.H. Schopler, Annotation,\r\nRetrospective Operation of State Statutes or\r\nRules of Court Conferring in Personam Jurisdiction Over Nonresidents or Foreign Corporations on the Basis of Isolated Acts\r\nor Transactions, 19 A.L.R.3d 138, 141-42 (1968) (comparing long-arm statutes that base jurisdiction on certain acts or\r\ntransactions specified therein to implied consent statutes that provide that certain acts or transactions are deemed to be the\r\nconsent to the appointment of  a local agent for the purpose of service of process; concluding the former operate retrospectively\r\nbut the latter do not as it is not possible to retroactively imply consent); see also \r\nJohnson v. Baldwin, 214 S.C. 545, 53 S.E.2d\r\n785 (1949) (refusing to permit the retrospective operation of an implied consent statute).\r\n\r\nWe conclude the long-arm statute acted retrospectively to confer  personal jurisdiction over Basnight although the minor child\r\nwas conceived prior to the enactment of the statute.  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's application of the long-arm\r\nstatute to Basnight.\r\n\r\nSufficient Minimum Contacts\r\n\r\nIn analyzing the second step necessary to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, we find Basnight had\r\nsufficient minimum contacts with South Carolina to meet the constitutional standards of due process.  In determining whether a\r\nfinding of minimum contacts comports with the due process requirements of traditional notions of fair play and substantial\r\njustice, the court must consider: (1) the duration of the activity of the nonresident within the state; (2) the character and\r\ncircumstances of the commission of the nonresident's act; (3) the inconvenience resulting to the parties by conferring or\r\nrefusing to confer jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the state's interest in exercising jurisdiction.  Clark v. Key, 304\r\nS.C. 497, 405 S.E.2d 599 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe mother testified she met Basnight in late 1982 when he was stationed at the United States Army post in Columbia, South\r\nCarolina.  Basnight and the mother engaged in sexual relations in early 1983 and again in March, 1984.  We find Basnight's\r\ntour of duty in South Carolina and continuing relationship with the mother from 1983 to early 1984 sufficient under the first\r\nand second factors.\r\n\r\nIn analyzing the third factor, the inconvenience to the parties, we recognize that Basnight is now stationed outside the state and\r\ndefending a suit in South Carolina is inconvenient for him.  However, we must weigh this against the final factor, South\r\nCarolina's interest in exercising  personal jurisdiction over Basnight.  We conclude South Carolina's interest in the support of a\r\nminor child residing within its borders is compelling.  Accordingly, we find the state's interest in exercising personal\r\njurisdiction over Basnight outweighs any hardship or inconvenience created by haling Basnight into the courts of this state.  \r\n\r\nRes Judicata (3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasnight also argues the family court erred in failing to find that the North Carolina order of dismissal barred this action under\r\nthe doctrine of res judicata.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The doctrine of res adjudicata (or\r\nres judicata) in the strict sense of that time-honored Latin phrase had its origin in the\r\nprinciple that it is in the public interest that there should be an end of litigation and that no one should be twice sued for the\r\nsame cause of action.\" First Nat'l Bank v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, 24, 35 S.E.2d 47, 56 (1945).  Under the\r\ndoctrine of res judicata, a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, without fraud or\r\ncollusion, is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies. Griggs v. Griggs, 214 S.C. 177, 51 S.E.2d 622 (1949).\r\n\r\n Res judicata precludes the parties from relitigating issues actually litigated and those that might have been litigated in the first\r\naction.  Town of Sullivan's Island v. Felger, 318 S.C. 340, 457 S.E.2d 626 (Ct. App. 1995).  In order for the doctrine of res\r\njudicata to apply, the following elements must be shown: (1) the identities of the parties are the same as the prior litigation;  (2)\r\nthe subject matter is the same as the prior litigation;  and (3) there was a prior adjudication of the issue by a court of competent\r\njurisdiction. Garris v.  Governing Bd. of South Carolina Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 511 S.E.2d 48 (1998);\r\nLowe v.\r\nClayton, 264 S.C. 75, 212 S.E.2d 582 (1975); Wold v. Funderburg, 250 S.C. 205, 157 S.E.2d 180 (1967).\r\n\r\nBasnight has failed to establish the third element.  A North Carolina court never issued a final order adjudicating the issues of\r\npaternity or the minor child's entitlement to support.  Res judicata, therefore, does not apply to bar the subsequent suit on the\r\nmerits.  See  Garris, 333 S.C. 432, 511 S.E.2d 48 (noting restraint in the application of the doctrine of res judicata is warranted\r\nwhen the prior action was dismissed on procedural grounds); Allen v. Southern Ry. Co., 218 S.C. 291, 62 S.E.2d 507 (1950)\r\n(plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of first action leaves situation as though no suit had ever been brought);\r\nGault v. Spoon, 168\r\nS.C. 160, 167 S.E. 229 (1932) (rejecting defendant's plea of res judicata against the plaintiff in the plaintiff's second action in\r\nclaim and delivery, where the first action failed because the plaintiff failed to execute the bond required by statute, because the\r\nfirst action was not allowed to proceed to a conclusion and therefore decided nothing).\r\nSee also  McEachern v. Black, 329 S.C.\r\n642, 496 S.E.2d 659 (Ct. App. 1998) (concluding a dismissal without prejudice is not an adjudication upon the merits and does\r\nnot have res judicata effect).  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's finding that the action was not barred by res\r\njudicata.\r\n\r\nAt oral argument, Basnight argued for the first time that the family court erred in failing to apply Rule 41(b) of the North\r\nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss this action based on the prior North Carolina proceedings.  This issue is not\r\npreserved for appellate review.  See \r\nIn the  Interest of Bruce O., 311 S.C. 514, 429 S.E.2d 858 (Ct. App. 1993) (An appellant\r\nmay not use oral argument as a vehicle to argue issues not argued in the appellant's brief.).  Even  on the merits, however, we\r\nconclude Basnight is not entitled to relief.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1986, the State of North Carolina, on behalf of the minor child, entered a voluntary dismissal of the North\r\nCarolina proceedings because Point and the minor child no longer resided in South Carolina.  On July 1986, the State filed a\r\nmotion to reopen the action.  The trial court granted the motion.  Basnight appealed.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals\r\nreversed the trial court concluding the court could not grant any motions or enter any orders \"after a voluntary dismissal has\r\nbeen taken in the cause.\"  North Carolina v. Basnight, Op. No. 8712DC214, filed June 16, 1987.  The Court of Appeals\r\nremanded the action for entry of an order in accordance with the opinion. Id.  On remand, the trial court entered a July 23,\r\n1997 order of dismissal with prejudice relying on the one year limitation in Rule 41(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure.\r\n\r\nBasnight argues the dismissal order, pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, operates as an\r\nadjudication of the matter.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nNorth Carolina's Rule 41(b) addresses the effect of involuntary dismissals.  However, the North Carolina action at issue was\r\nvoluntarily dismissed.  Rule 41(a) addresses voluntary dismissals and states \"[u]nless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal\r\n. . . the dismissal is without prejudice. . . . If an action commenced . . . is dismissed without prejudice under this subsection, a\r\nnew action based on the same claim may be commenced within one year after such dismissal. . . .\"  Rule 41(a)(1), N. C. Rules\r\nCiv. Proc. \r\n\r\nHowever, the one year period to reinstitute the claim is stayed pending appellate action over the voluntary dismissal.  West v.\r\nReddick, Inc., 274 S.E.2d 221 (N.C. 1981).  Furthermore, a trial court has no authority to exceed the mandate of the appellate\r\ncourt on remand.  5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review Â§ 784, at 453 (1995) (Once a mandate is issued from an appellate court to a\r\ntrial court, the trial court \"is vested with jurisdiction only to the extent conferred by the appellate court's opinion and\r\nmandate.\").  The North Carolina appellate court concluded the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain\r\nthe motion to reopen the case and remanded the action for dismissal according to that finding.  The North Carolina trial court\r\ndid not have subject matter jurisdiction to go beyond that mandate to apply Rule 41 to the action.  A foreign judgment is not\r\nentitled to full faith and credit if the rendering court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.\r\nGregoire v. Byrd, 338\r\nS.C. 489, 527 S.E.2d 361 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this action was initiated under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act.  The Act's remedies are in\r\naddition to, and not in substitution for, any and all other remedies existing within the states.  67A C.J.S. Parent &amp; Child Â§ 90\r\n(1978).  \"Thus, it has been held that an award for support under the Act does not preclude a later statutory action for support . .\r\n. .\" Id. Â§ 90, at 441.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rule 41(a) of our rules of civil procedure does not include a one year limitation.  See Rule 41(a), SCRCP.  We view\r\nNorth Carolina's one year limitation as a procedural docket-clearing mechanism rather than a rule of substantive law.  Under\r\nSouth Carolina's public policy, the best interests of minor children prevail over procedural impediments to obtaining support\r\nfor minor children. See  Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (stating procedural rules are subservient to the\r\ncourt's duty to zealously guard the rights of minors); Ex parte Roper, 254 S.C. 558, 563, 176 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1970)\r\n(\"[W]here the rights and best interests of a minor child are concerned, the court may appropriately raise,\r\nex mero motu, issues\r\nnot raised by the parties.\"); Galloway v. Galloway, 249 S.C. 157, 153 S.E.2d 326 (1967) (concluding the court's duty to protect\r\nthe rights of minors has precedence over procedural rules).\r\n\r\nOur family court did not err by not applying North Carolina's Rule 41(b) to this action.  Thus, even if Basnight had preserved\r\nhis argument that the action should be dismissed pursuant to North Carolina's Rule 41(b), we would not find him entitled to\r\nrelief.  \r\n\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP (4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasnight next argues the family court erred in refusing to allow a record hearing on the merits of his Rule 60(b), SCRCP,\r\nmotion for relief from judgment and/or in failing to issue a stay pending a hearing on the motion.  DSS avers Basnight filed his\r\nRule 60(b) motion, then requested, in chambers, the family court hold an emergency hearing.  The court refused, and allegedly\r\nadvised Basnight to file a written request for a hearing with the clerk of court.  Basnight instead filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nThe issue Basnight relies on in support of his Rule 60(b) motion has not yet been presented to or ruled upon by the family\r\ncourt. (5)  DSS admits the issue \"may have been collateral\" and does not object to the matter being raised post-trial.  We find the\r\nissue is not ripe for review by this Court.  See \r\nBaber v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. 31, 488 S.E.2d 314 (1997) (finding an\r\nissue not yet presented to the Tax Commission not ripe for appellate review).\r\n\r\nError Preservation (6)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his brief, Basnight finally argues the family court erred in: (1) failing to dismiss this action because there exists no affidavit\r\nof proof of service of process on Basnight; and (2) failing to dismiss the action where no guardian ad litem was appointed for\r\nthe child.  Neither issue was raised to or ruled upon by the family court, and they are therefore not properly before this court for\r\nreview.  McDavid v. McDavid,  333 S.C. 490, 511 S.E.2d 365 (1999) (holding an issue not raised to or ruled on by the family\r\ncourt should not be considered by the appellate court).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, GOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n1.

We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nHolnam operates a cement plant near Holly Hill, South Carolina.  The plant includes a quarry which houses a large diesel fuel\r\nstorage tank.  Holnam hired Murray in 1989 as a control room operator.  Murray's responsibilities involved operating cement-mixing machinery.  Michael Smoak supervised Murray's shift.  When Smoak was absent, Murray acted as the relief supervisor.\r\n\r\nWhile working as relief supervisor one evening in June, 1996, Murray noticed that Chris Barnes, a coworker, was absent for\r\napproximately six hours.  Murray confronted Barnes, who denied the absenteeism.  Murray and Barnes argued.  Murray\r\nthreatened to report Barnes to Smoak.  Barnes accused Murray of stealing diesel fuel by loading it into a fuel tank on the back\r\nof his truck.  Murray declared he notified Smoak of the incident and of Barnes' allegation.  Murray told Derome Wilson, a\r\ncoworker, of Barnes' accusation, and of Murray's report to Smoak.  Murray claims Smoak told him not to worry about the\r\nincident or Barnes' allegation.\r\n\r\nShortly after the occurrence, Barnes called Jim Bacot, a Holnam purchasing agent, and alleged he saw Murray steal diesel fuel\r\non at least two occasions.  According to Barnes, he and a coworker, Terry Jenkins, watched Murray fill his tanks with diesel\r\nfuel on the nights of March 15, 1996, and May 21, 1996.  Barnes maintained they viewed the incidents from the top of an\r\nelevator about 100 yards from the storage tank.  He averred that on May 21, 1996, he and Jenkins checked the gauge of the\r\ndiesel tank and concluded Murray took 371 gallons.  When asked whether he would have \"told anybody about the diesel fuel\"\r\nif Murray had not informed Smoak that he had been absent from work for six hours, Barnes responded:  \"I can't say.\"\r\n\r\nAt his deposition, Terry Jenkins denied observing Murray steal fuel or antifreeze. Further, as to the alleged May 21, 1996,\r\nincident, Jenkins acknowledged he did not check the gauge of the diesel tank prior to Murray entering the quarry.  Jenkins\r\nstated one time he was on top of a crane when he saw Murray in the quarry, but he could not see Murray's actions because it\r\nwas dark.  However, in a statement prepared by the human resources manager, Jenkins stated he observed Murray steal fuel and\r\nantifreeze.  Jenkins, Barnes' high school acquaintance, admitted Barnes told him he was going to report Murray for stealing in\r\nresponse to Murray reporting Barnes absent from work.\r\n\r\nBacot reported the allegations to his supervisor and to Robbie Mims, production superintendent.  At the time, Bonnie Connelly\r\nwas the human resources manager and William Patterson was the plant manager.  Mims and Smoak decided to \"keep a watch\r\non\" Murray.  Smoak believed Murray arrived at work the evening of June 8, 1996, with an empty tank on his truck.  Mims\r\nthought Murray left the following morning with the tank full.  Mims admitted he did not see Murray take any fuel.  Patterson\r\nand Connelly explained to Mims that they could not proceed with action against Murray based solely on Barnes' allegations\r\nand Mims' and Smoak's suppositions.\r\n\r\nApproximately one year later, in May of 1997, Barnes contacted Bacot and stated: \"We've got a new administration and maybe\r\nwe ought to give it another try.\"  Bacot was unaware of the altercation between Murray and Barnes.  Barnes alleged four\r\nadditional incidents of Murray stealing fuel, oil, and antifreeze.  After Barnes reported this information to him, Bacot notified\r\nDebbie Lightfoot, the new human resources manager, and Tom Thornton, the new plant manager.  Bacot and Mims explained\r\nto Thornton and Lightfoot that the 1996 allegations had been determined to be insufficient by the previous management team. \r\nLightfoot investigated by interviewing numerous employees.\r\n\r\nOn June 13, 1997, when Murray drove into the parking lot at work, Smoak requested Murray accompany him to Thornton's\r\noffice.  Thornton, Lightfoot, Smoak, and Mims were present.  Thornton informed Murray he was suspended for stealing\r\ncompany property.  When Murray asked what he was accused of stealing, Thornton refused to answer stating the Orangeburg\r\nCounty Sheriff's Office was investigating. Thornton did not notify Murray of a definite time for the suspension but stated\r\nsomeone from Holnam would get in touch with him.\r\n\r\nMurray testified that on Thursday of the following week, Lightfoot called him and asked him to meet with Holnam\r\nrepresentatives the following day.  The same people that attended the suspension meeting were at this second meeting. \r\nThornton again advised Murray that he had been accused of stealing company property.  Thornton refused to: (1) tell Murray\r\nwhat he was accused of stealing; (2) identify the witnesses reporting the theft; or (3) explain the allegations.  Murray initially\r\nassumed the accusation stemmed from an incident involving a coat.  Murray next suspected the accusations were related to the\r\nincident with Barnes.  Murray explained he had reported the incident to Smoak.  Smoak denied Murray communicated this\r\ninformation to him.\r\n\r\nMurray produced receipts for fuel he purchased.  Thornton informed Murray the receipts were insufficient.  Murray was\r\nterminated at the meeting.  Murray denied stealing fuel, oil, or antifreeze from Holnam.  The allegations were never reported to\r\nthe sheriff's office.  No one from Holnam investigated the incident between Barnes and Murray.\r\n\r\nBarnes and Jenkins testified Mike Smoak held a meeting of his employees, including at least six workers, and told them Murray\r\nwas fired for misappropriating or misusing company property.  Smoak alleges he held the meeting after the suspension and\r\nnotified the employees that Murray was \"suspended for misuse of company property pending investigation.\"  Murray's appeal\r\ncenters on the statement made by Smoak to the employees in the meeting.\r\n\r\nMurray filed this action against his former employer, Holnam, Inc., and Thomas Thornton, Holnam's plant manager, alleging\r\nwrongful discharge and slander.  Holnam and Thornton moved for summary judgment.  Prior to the hearing on this motion,\r\nMurray moved to amend the complaint to include a cause of action for libel.  In addition, Murray withdrew the wrongful\r\ndischarge claim.  Although the trial judge did not specifically address the motion to amend, he considered the parties'\r\narguments on libel and ruled on the issue. (1)\r\n\r\nThe trial judge granted summary judgment to Holnam and Thornton.  Murray appeals the portion of the order granting\r\nsummary judgment to Holnam on the slander claim.  Murray does not appeal the grant of summary judgment to Thornton. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law.  Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 530 S.E.2d 369 (2000); Young v.\r\nSouth Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\nSee  also \r\nBruce v.\r\nDurney, 341 S.C. 563, 534 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 2000)(motion for summary judgment shall be granted if pleadings,\r\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as\r\nto any material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law).  In determining whether any triable issue of fact\r\nexists, as will preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C.\r\n53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999).  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.\r\nRothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C.\r\n402, 409 S.E.2d 366 (1991); Young,\r\nsupra.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of\r\nthe law. Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000);\r\nCarolina Alliance for Fair Employment v.\r\nSouth Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999).  All ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party.\r\nVermeer, supra.  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from\r\nthem, summary judgment should be denied. Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672\r\n(2000); Vermeer, supra.\r\n\r\nIn general, if the pleadings and the evidentiary matter in support of summary judgment do not establish the absence of a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact, summary judgment must be denied, even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.\r\nBaird\r\nv. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999).  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be\r\ncautiously invoked so no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.\r\nCarolina Alliance, supra.\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to\r\nRule 56, SCRCP. Brockbank, supra;\r\nWells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Defamation and Agency\r\n\r\nMurray contends the trial judge erred in concluding Holnam was not liable for defamation arising from Smoak's statement\r\nbecause Holnam did not expressly direct Smoak to make the statement.  We agree.\r\n\r\nIn Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 526 S.E.2d 732 (Ct. App. 2000), this\r\nCourt explained:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tort of defamation allows a plaintiff to recover for injury to his or her reputation as the result of the defendant's\r\ncommunications to others of a false message about the plaintiff. Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469,\r\n514 S.E.2d 126 (1999).  The focus of defamation is not on the hurt to the defamed party's feelings, but on the injury to his\r\nreputation. See  Wardlaw v. Peck, 282 S.C. 199, 318 S.E.2d 270 (Ct. App. 1984).  Defamatory communications take two\r\nforms: libel and slander. Swinton Creek Nursery,\r\nsupra.  Slander is a spoken defamation, while libel is a written defamation or\r\none accomplished by actions or conduct. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\nFleming, 338 S.C. at 532, 526 S.E.2d at 737.  Defamation need not be accomplished in a direct manner.\r\nEubanks v. Smith, 292\r\nS.C. 57, 354 S.E.2d 898 (1987); Tyler v. Macks Stores, 275 S.C. 456, 272 S.E.2d 633 (1980).  A mere insinuation is actionable\r\nas a positive assertion if it is false and malicious and its meaning is plain. Eubanks,\r\nsupra; Tyler,\r\nsupra.\r\n\r\nThe elements of defamation include: (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (2) an unprivileged publication\r\nto a third party; (3) fault on the part of the publisher; and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or\r\nthe existence of special harm caused by the publication. Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d\r\n497 (1998)(Toal, J., concurring in result in separate opinion); Fleming,\r\nsupra.  A communication is defamatory if it tends to\r\nharm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or\r\ndealing with him. Fleming, supra.\r\n\r\nHere, the trial judge concluded a principal could not be vicariously liable for statements made by an agent unless the agent was\r\nexpressly authorized to make the statement.  However, a principal may be held liable for defamatory statements made by an\r\nagent acting within the scope of his employment or within the scope of his apparent authority.\r\nAbofreka v. Alston Tobacco\r\nCo., 288 S.C. 122, 341 S.E.2d 622 (1986). See \r\nalso Restatement (Second) of Agency Â§ 247 (1965)(master is subject to liability\r\nfor defamatory statements made by servant acting within scope of his employment, or, as to those hearing or reading the\r\nstatement, within his apparent authority).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge improperly concluded Holnam could not be held liable absent express authorization to Smoak.\r\n\r\nII.  Qualified Privilege\r\n\r\nMurray argues the trial judge erred in concluding: (1) Smoak's statement was protected by qualified privilege and (2) Smoak\r\ndid not exceed the scope of the privilege.\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469, 514 S.E.2d 126\r\n(1999):\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a defamation action, the defendant may assert the affirmative defense of conditional or qualified privilege.  Under this\r\ndefense, one who publishes defamatory matter concerning another is not liable for the publication if (1) the matter is published\r\nupon an occasion that makes it conditionally privileged, and (2) the privilege is not abused.  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§\r\n593 (1977); see  Bell v. Bank of Abbeville, 208 S.C. 490, 38 S.E.2d 641 (1946).  In\r\nBell, this Court held:\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn determining whether or not the communication was qualifiedly privileged, regard must be had to the occasion and to the\r\nrelationship of the parties.  When one has an interest in the subject matter of a communication, and the person (or persons) to\r\nwhom it is made has a corresponding interest, every communication honestly made, in order to protect such common interest, is\r\nprivileged by reason of the occasion.  The statement, however, must be such as the occasion warrants, and must be made in\r\ngood faith to protect the interests of the one who makes it and the persons to whom it is addressed.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBell, 208 S.C. at 493-94, 38 S.E.2d at 643. . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn general, the question whether an occasion gives rise to a qualified or conditional privilege is one of law for the court.  50\r\nAm. Jur. 2d Libel and Slander Â§ 276 (1995).  However, the question whether the privilege has been abused is one for the jury.\r\nId.  Factual inquiries, such as whether the defendants acted in good faith in making the statement, whether the scope of the\r\nstatement was properly limited in its scope, and whether the statement was sent only to the proper parties, are generally left in\r\nthe hands of the jury to determine whether the privilege was abused. Id.;\r\nsee  also Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 599-610. \r\nIn Fulton [v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 220 S.C. 287, 67 S.E.2d 425 (1951)], this Court held that it was a question for the jury\r\nto determine if the publication went beyond what the occasion required and was unnecessarily defamatory.\r\nFulton, 220 S.C. at\r\n297, 67 S.E.2d at 429; cf. Woodward, 277 S.C. at 32-33, 282 S.E.2d at 601 (\"While abuse of privilege is ordinarily an issue\r\nfor the jury, . . . in the absence of a controversy as to the facts . . . it is for the court to say in a given instance whether or not the\r\nprivilege has been abused or exceeded.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nSwinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 484-85, 514 S.E.2d at 134.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the trial judge to determine if the statement is privileged.\r\nId.  A communication made in good faith on any\r\nsubject matter in which the person communicating has an interest or duty is qualifiedly privileged if made to a person with a\r\ncorresponding interest or duty even though it contains matter which, without this privilege, would be actionable.\r\nConstant v.\r\nSpartanburg Steel Prods., Inc., 316 S.C. 86, 447 S.E.2d 194 (1994); Prentiss v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 256 S.C. 141, 181\r\nS.E.2d 325 (1971).  Communications between officers and employees of a corporation are qualifiedly privileged if made in\r\ngood faith and in the usual course of business. Conwell v. Spur Oil Co., 240 S.C. 170, 125 S.E.2d 270 (1962).\r\n\r\nWe find the trial judge did not err in initially concluding Smoak was protected by a qualified privilege.  Yet, the protection of a\r\nqualified privilege may be lost by the manner of its exercise. Fulton v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 220 S.C. 287, 67 S.E.2d 425\r\n(1951).  The publisher must not wander beyond the scope of the occasion. Constant,\r\nsupra; Woodward v. South Carolina Farm\r\nBureau Ins. Co., 277 S.C. 29, 282 S.E.2d 599 (1981).  The privilege does not protect any unnecessary defamation.\r\nFulton, supra.  In order for a communication to be privileged, the person making it must be careful to go no further than his interests or\r\nhis duties require. Id.  Where the speaker exceeds his privilege and the communication complained of goes beyond what the\r\noccasion demands that he should publish, and is unnecessarily defamatory of the  plaintiff, he will not be protected.\r\nId.  The\r\nexistence of a duty, a common interest, or a confidential relation is not a defense.\r\nId.\r\n\r\nWhether the publication went too far beyond what the occasion required, resulting in the loss of the qualified privilege, is a\r\nquestion for the jury. Id. See \r\nalso  Constant, 316 S.C. at 89, 447 S.E.2d at 196 (\"It is ordinarily for the jury to determine\r\nwhether the privilege has been abused or exceeded.\").\r\n\r\nWe find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the qualified privilege was lost.\r\n\r\nIII.  Actual Malice\r\n\r\nMurray maintains the trial judge erred in concluding there were no genuine issues of fact regarding whether Smoak made the\r\nstatements with actual malice.  We agree.\r\n\r\nIf a defamation is actionable per se, then under common law principles the law presumes the defendant acted with common law\r\nmalice and that the plaintiff suffered general damages. Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d\r\n497 (1998).  If a defamation is not actionable per se, then at common law the plaintiff must plead and prove common law actual\r\nmalice and special damages. Id.  Slander is actionable per se if it charges the plaintiff with one of five types of acts or\r\ncharacteristics: (1) commission of a crime of moral turpitude; (2) contraction of a loathsome disease; (3) adultery; (4)\r\nunchastity; or (5) unfitness in one's business or profession. Id.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if the slander is actionable per se, if the communication is privileged, the plaintiff must prove actual malice.\r\nBell v. Bank of Abbeville, 208 S.C. 490, 38 S.E.2d 641 (1946)(privileged communication is exception to rule that malice will\r\nbe presumed where offending statement is actionable per se).  A qualified privilege does not prevent liability for defamation\r\nwhere the statement is made with actual malice. Eubanks v. Smith, 292 S.C. 57, 354 S.E.2d 898 (1987).\r\nSee  also \r\nBell, supra\r\n(in defamation action, if defendant proves qualified privilege, plaintiff may not recover unless he overcomes privilege by\r\nproving actual malice).\r\n\r\nCommon law actual malice means the defendant acted with ill will toward the plaintiff or acted recklessly or wantonly,\r\nmeaning with conscious indifference toward the plaintiff's rights. Padgett v. Sun News, 278 S.C. 26, 292 S.E.2d 30 (1982). \r\nThe Court, in Fulton v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 220 S.C. 287, 67 S.E.2d 425 (1951), discussed malice:\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the appellant believed the charges to be true did not justify it in publishing them in an improper and unjustified manner or\r\nwith improper and unjustified motives.  Proof that they were published in such manner and with such motives would constitute\r\nsufficient proof of malice, or malice in fact.  It is not necessary that evidence must be offered of malignity or ill will, nor that\r\nthose facts should be found.  The time, place, and other circumstances of the preparation and publication of defamatory\r\ncharges, as well as the language of the publication itself, are admissible evidence to show that the false charge was made with\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFulton, 220 S.C. at 296, 67 S.E.2d at 429.  An academic review of malice is presented in\r\nJones v. Garner, 250 S.C. 479, 158\r\nS.E.2d 909 (1968). Jones enunciates:\r\n\r\n\r\nMalice, in actions for libel or slander, is of two kinds: implied malice or malice in law, and actual malice or malice in fact.\r\n\r\n\"Malice in law, or legal malice, is a presumption of law and dispenses with the proof of malice when words which raise such\r\npresumption are shown to have been uttered.  This form of malice is not necessarily inconsistent with an honest or even\r\nlaudable purpose and does not imply ill will, personal malice, hatred, or a purpose to injure.\"  33 Am. Jur.\r\nLibel and Slander,\r\nSection 111.  Also, 53 C.J.S. Libel and Slander Â§ 2.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\nActual malice or malice in fact is not presumed and must be proved.  Actual malice means that the defendant was actuated by\r\nill will in what he did, with the design to causelessly and wantonly injure the plaintiff; or that the statements were published\r\nwith such recklessness as to show a conscious indifference toward plaintiff's rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nJones, 250 S.C. at 488, 158 S.E.2d at 913-14.\r\nSee  also \r\nEubanks v. Smith, 292 S.C. 57, 63, 354 S.E.2d 898, 902 (1987)(\"Actual\r\nmalice is ill will, recklessness, wantonness, or conscious indifference to the plaintiff's rights.\").\r\n\r\nIn Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (1998), our Supreme Court revisited malice and\r\nlifted the definition of common law actual malice from Jones v. Garner,\r\nsupra: &quot;[C]ommon law actual malice, that is 'the\r\ndefendant was activated by ill will in what he did, with the design to causelessly and wantonly injure the plaintiff; or that the\r\nstatements were published with such recklessness as to show a conscious indifference toward plaintiff's reports.'\"\r\nHoltzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 510 n.3, 506 S.E.2d at 501 n.3.  The case\r\nsub  judice is controlled by the definition of common law\r\nactual malice because the plaintiff is a private citizen.  A different definition of\r\nmalice is efficacious in regard to a public official or public figure:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn defamation actions involving a \"public official\" or \"public figure,\" the plaintiff must prove the statement was made with\r\n\"actual malice,\" i.e., with either knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard for its truth.\r\nNew York Times Co. v.\r\nSullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41\r\nL.Ed.2d 789 (1974). . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\nThe actual malice standard is not satisfied merely through a showing of ill will or \"malice\" in the ordinary sense of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger, 341 S.C. 108, 113-14, 533 S.E.2d 899, 901-02 (2000).  The public official or public figure definition\r\nof actual malice is inapposite to the case at bar.\r\n\r\nActual malice requires that at the time of the defendant's act or omission he was conscious or chargeable with consciousness of\r\nhis wrongdoing. Padgett v. Sun News, 278 S.C. 26, 292 S.E.2d 30 (1982).  Malice may be proved by direct or circumstantial\r\nevidence. Hainer v. American Medical Int'l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 492 S.E.2d 103 (1997);\r\nSmith v. Smith, 194 S.C. 247, 9\r\nS.E.2d 584 (1940).\r\n\r\nWhether malice is the incentive for a publication is ordinarily for the jury to decide.\r\nSee  Ponticelli v. Mine Safety Appliance\r\nCo., 247 A.2d 303 (R.I. 1968)(citing 3 Restatement of Torts Â§ 619(2)).  Proof that statements were published in an improper\r\nand unjustified manner is sufficient evidence to submit the issue of actual malice to a jury.\r\nHainer, supra;\r\nMains v. K Mart\r\nCorp., 297 S.C. 142, 375 S.E.2d 311 (Ct. App. 1988). See \r\nalso  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469,\r\n514 S.E.2d 126 (1999)(finding factual inquiries, such as whether the defendants acted in good faith in making the statement,\r\nquestions for the jury).\r\n\r\nWe find genuine issues of fact exist regarding whether the statement was made with actual malice.  The issue of actual malice\r\nis properly a question for the jury.\r\n\r\nIV.  Self-Publication\r\n\r\nMurray claims the trial judge erred in finding Murray's self-publication barred him from recovering damages.  We agree.\r\n\r\nSelf-publication of the allegedly defamatory statement may bar a plaintiff from recovery.  David P. Chapus, Annotation,\r\nPublication of Allegedly Defamatory Matter by Plaintiff (\"Self-Publication\") As Sufficient to Support Defamation Action, 62\r\nA.L.R. 4th 616 (1988). See  also 50 Am. Jur. 2d\r\nLibel and Slander Â§ 241 (1995)(as a general rule, where a person\r\ncommunicates a defamatory statement only to person defamed and defamed person then repeats statement to others, publication\r\nof statement by person defamed, or \"self-publication,\" will not support defamation action against originator of statements).  In\r\nthe instant case, the trial judge concluded Murray's report to Smoak and Derome Wilson, was self-publication of the\r\n\"defamation of his character.\"\r\n\r\nMurray's statements to Smoak and Wilson were not publications of the allegedly defamatory statements.  Murray reported\r\nBarnes' absenteeism and subsequent accusations to Smoak.  Murray informed Wilson about the incident and his report to\r\nSmoak.  Smoak's alleged defamatory statement was that Murray was terminated for misappropriating company property.\r\n\r\nWe find Murray's statements are not comparable to Smoak's statement. Concomitantly, Murray's statements were not self-publication.  The judge erred in determining Murray's self-publication bars him from recovery.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold Holnam can be liable for Smoak's allegedly defamatory statement even though Smoak did not have express authority\r\nto make the statement.  We rule a principal may be held liable for defamatory statements made by an agent acting within the\r\nscope of his employment or within the scope of his apparent authority.  Further, although the trial judge properly concluded\r\nSmoak was protected by a qualified privilege, genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether Smoak exceeded the\r\nscope of his qualified privilege.  Additionally, the issue of common law actual malice is a question for the jury.  Finally,\r\nMurray is not barred from recovery by self-publication.  Accordingly, we REVERSE the trial judge's order granting summary\r\njudgment and REMAND for trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n1.   Amendment to a complaint may be impliedly consented to in a summary judgment hearing where the trial judge fails to\r\nexpressly rule on the motion to amend, but the parties and trial judge treat the complaint as if amended.\r\nSee  Staubes v. City of\r\nFolly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000).

Bayle appeals the grant of summary judgment \r\n  to the South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT). The court ruled Bayle's \r\n  actions were barred by the statute of limitations. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nPatricia Bayle was killed on October \r\n  12, 1994, when she lost control of her vehicle as she drove into a large amount \r\n  of standing water in the northbound lane of I-85. Bayle's car crossed the median \r\n  and struck an oncoming tractor-trailer in the southbound lane of I-85. Bayle \r\n  died at the scene.\r\n  \r\nMore than two years after Patricia \r\n  Bayle's death, an attorney for Paul Wilson contacted Bayle's husband, Joel. \r\n  As a result, Joel learned that ten days prior to his wife's accident, Paul Wilson \r\n  was involved in a collision with Robert Latham, who lost control of his vehicle \r\n  after driving into standing water in the northbound lane of I-85. After finding \r\n  out about the Wilson wreck and other similar accidents on I-85 from Wilson's \r\n  counsel, Joel Bayle filed these actions for wrongful death and survival against \r\n  DOT on September 19, 1997.\r\n  \r\nThe actions allege DOT negligently \r\n  constructed, maintained, and/or repaired the roadway, failed to warn drivers \r\n  of a water hazard, and/or failed to construct barricades or guardrails to protect \r\n  persons using the roadway.\r\n  \r\nDOT answered asserting the actions \r\n  were barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act's two-year statute of limitations. \r\n  The Circuit Court agreed and granted summary judgment to DOT.\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is proper when there \r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 \r\n  S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. See also Bruce \r\n  v. Durney, 341 S.C. 563, 534 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 2000)(motion for summary \r\n  judgment shall be granted if pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories \r\n  and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as matter \r\n  of law). In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, as will preclude \r\n  summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \r\n  Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 \r\n  S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999). If triable issues exist, those issues must be submitted \r\n  to the jury. Young, supra.\r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the \r\n  application of the law. Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 688 (2000). All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising \r\n  from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the movant. Vermeer, \r\n  supra. Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to \r\n  the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should \r\n  be denied. Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 672 (2000). However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts \r\n  exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. \r\n  Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n  \r\nAn appellate court reviews the granting \r\n  of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant \r\n  to Rule 56, SCRCP. Brockbank, supra; Wells v. City of Lynchburg, \r\n  331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  \r\nISSUES\r\n  \r\nI. Did the Circuit Court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment to DOT based on the statute of limitations?\r\n  \r\nII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  quashing discovery?\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Summary Judgment\r\n\r\nBayle contends the Circuit Court \r\nerred in granting summary judgment to DOT because (1) the court incorrectly defined \r\nthe term \"loss\"; (2) the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations; (3) \r\nhe was reasonably diligent in filing suit; and (4) he presented evidence of latent \r\ndefects in the roadway.\r\n \r\nBayle brought this action against \r\n  DOT, a governmental entity. Thus, the South Carolina Tort Claims Act delineates \r\n  the parameters within which Bayle may pursue his claims. DOT is a governmental \r\n  entity as defined by the Act. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(d), (e) &amp; (h) \r\n  (Supp. 1999).\r\n  \r\nThe Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \r\n  immunity for torts committed by the State, its political subdivisions, and governmental \r\n  employees acting within the scope of their official duties. See Pike v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Transp., Op. No. 25208 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 6, \r\n  2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 10); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 1999). \r\n  The Act does not create a cause of action. See Summers v. Harrison Constr., \r\n  298 S.C. 451, 381 S.E.2d 493 (Ct. App. 1989); see also Moore v. Florence \r\n  Sch. Dist. No. 1, 314 S.C. 335, 444 S.E.2d 498 (1994)(Tort Claims Act does \r\n  not create new substantive cause of action against government entity). Rather, \r\n  it removes the common law bar of sovereign immunity in certain circumstances, \r\n  but only to the extent mandated by the Act. Summers, supra.\r\n  \r\nThe Tort Claims Act \"is the exclusive \r\n  and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental \r\n  entity while acting within the scope of the employee's official duty.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-200 (Supp. 1999)(emphasis added). The Act contains a two-year \r\n  statute of limitations. Section 15-78-110 declares:\r\n  \r\n \r\n  Except as provided for in Section \r\n    15-3-40, any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless \r\n    an action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or \r\n    should have been discovered; provided, that if the claimant first filed \r\n    a claim pursuant to this chapter then the action for damages based upon the \r\n    same occurrence is forever barred unless the action is commenced within three \r\n    years of the date the loss was or should have been discovered.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. \r\n  1999)(emphasis added).\r\nBayle asserts the Circuit Court erred \r\n  in defining \"loss\" as the date of his wife's death rather than the date he learned \r\n  of a possible latent defect in the road surface. We disagree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act specifically \r\n  defines loss:\r\n \r\n  \"Loss\" means bodily injury, \r\n    disease, death, or damage to tangible property, including lost wages and economic \r\n    loss to the person who suffered the injury, disease, or death, pain and suffering, \r\n    mental anguish, and any other element of actual damages recoverable in actions \r\n    for negligence, but does not include the intentional infliction of emotional \r\n    harm.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(f) (Supp. \r\n  1999)(emphasis added). The Tort Claims Act contains a definition of loss that \r\n  differs from that of other statutes. Therefore, Bayle's reliance on medical \r\n  or legal malpractice cases not governed by the Act is misplaced.\r\nIn his brief, Bayle cited Johnston \r\n  v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, 437 S.E.2d 45 (1993), for the proposition that whether \r\n  a claimant knew or should have known a cause of action existed is a jury question. \r\n  First, Johnston construes a different statute of limitations, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-545 (Supp. 1999). Additionally, Johnston reaches the same \r\n  result as the court in the instant case. The Johnston Court held the \r\n  statute of limitations begins to run when a person of common knowledge and experience \r\n  would be on notice a claim might exist, not when the plaintiff discovers a witness \r\n  to support or prove the case.\r\nBayle's \"loss,\" according to the \r\n  clear provisions of the statute, was the death of his wife, rather than the \r\n  date he learned of a possible latent defect in the road surface. When statutory \r\n  language is unambiguous, this Court may not impose a contrary meaning. In \r\n  re Vincent J., 333 S.C. 233, 509 S.E.2d 261 (1998).\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction \r\n  is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. Joiner v. Rivas, \r\n  342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000). Under the plain meaning rule, it is not \r\n  the court's place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute. \r\n  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000). Where the statute's \r\n  language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, \r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right \r\n  to impose another meaning. Id. What a legislature says in the text of \r\n  a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. \r\n  Id. Therefore, the courts are bound to give effect to the expressed intent \r\n  of the legislature. Id.\r\nProvisions of the Tort Claims Act \r\n  establishing limitations upon and exemptions from liability of a governmental \r\n  entity must be liberally construed in favor of limiting the liability of the \r\n  State. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-20(f) &amp; -200 (Supp. 1999); Steinke \r\n  v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, \r\n  520 S.E.2d 142 (1999); Baker v. Sanders, 301 S.C. 170, 391 S.E.2d 229 \r\n  (1990). We conclude the Circuit Court correctly held Bayle's loss occurred on \r\n  the date of his wife's death.\r\nBayle asserts the discovery rule \r\n  tolled the statute of limitations until he knew a cause of action existed against \r\n  DOT for his wife's death. The discovery rule is applicable to actions brought \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act. See Joubert v. South Carolina Dep't of Social \r\n  Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nAccording to the discovery rule, \r\n  the statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought \r\n  to have been discovered. Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 \r\n  (1996). The statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or should \r\n  have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises \r\n  from the wrongful conduct. Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999). The date on which discovery of \r\n  the cause of action should have been made is an objective, rather than subjective, \r\n  question. See Joubert, supra; Young, supra. \"In other words, whether \r\n  the particular plaintiff actually knew he had a claim is not the test. Rather, \r\n  courts must decide whether the circumstances of the case would put a person \r\n  of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been \r\n  invaded, or that some claim against another party might exist.\" Young, \r\n  333 S.C. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416.\r\nIn Young, this Court held \r\n  that an inmate was not required to know the sight in his right eye was permanently \r\n  lost to be put on notice the Department of Corrections had caused him injury \r\n  by delaying appropriate medical treatment. The Court found:\r\n \r\n  Viewing the facts and inferences \r\n    in the light most favorable to Young, we rule he was put on notice in May \r\n    of 1993 that he had a claim against the Department of Corrections for the \r\n    delay in diagnosis, treatment, or referral to a specialist. Two doctors, Dr. \r\n    McLane and Dr. Gross, commented on the delay in medical treatment. On May \r\n    11, 1993, the date of his retinal repair surgery, Young was aware he had suffered \r\n    a delay in treatment, that the delay concerned doctors, and that he had scar \r\n    tissue built up in his eye. Thus, the statute of limitations on his claim \r\n    began to run on May 11, 1993.\r\n  Although Young could not determine \r\n    the extent of his loss until after the July 1994 cataract surgery, the law \r\n    is clear the statute of limitations is not tolled during the period of time \r\n    in which a plaintiff is merely unaware of the extent of an actionable injury. \r\n    The fact that Young's vision did not deteriorate between January of 1993, \r\n    when he first complained to medical personnel at Perry and May of 1993, when \r\n    he was diagnosed and treated, does not present a genuine issue of material \r\n    fact as to when the statute of limitations began to run. Young was not required \r\n    to understand fully the ramifications of the scar tissue buildup or delay \r\n    in diagnosis and treatment to be put on notice the delay had resulted in an \r\n    injury.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  We hold the concernment expressed \r\n    by the doctors, in conjunction with the other evidence in this case, was sufficient \r\n    to place a reasonable person of common knowledge and experience on notice \r\n    that a claim against the Department of Corrections might exist. Acting with \r\n    reasonable diligence, Young could or should have known a cause of action might \r\n    exist as of May 11, 1993. Young had until May 11, 1995, to file this action. \r\n    Instead, Young did not bring this action until June 2, 1996. Because he did \r\n    not file this action within two years from the time he discovered or reasonably \r\n    should have discovered the injury, Young's claim is barred by the statute \r\n    of limitations.\r\n\r\nYoung, 333 S.C. at 719-20, \r\n  511 S.E.2d at 416-17 (citations omitted).\r\nThis Court revisited the date of \r\n  loss issue in Joubert v. South Carolina Department of Social Services, \r\n  341 S.C. 176, 534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2000). In that case, DSS denied Joubert's \r\n  application for renewal of his license to operate The Pines, a residential treatment \r\n  facility for emotionally disturbed teenage girls, after determining Joubert, \r\n  the director of the Pines, had neglected and failed to adequately supervise \r\n  two teenage clients. Joubert filed a tort action against DSS alleging, inter \r\n  alia, gross negligence in the failure to renew the treatment center's license. \r\n  The Circuit Court granted summary judgment to DSS on the basis of the statute \r\n  of limitations.\r\n Joubert contended his loss occurred \r\n  not on the date of the unfavorable DSS decision or action, but rather on the \r\n  date the Family Court agreed with him the DSS decisions were improper. The Circuit \r\n  Court disagreed. On appeal, this Court affirmed the Circuit Court, finding that \r\n  \"[u]nder the Tort Claims Act, . . . the statute of limitations begins to run \r\n  when the plaintiff should know that he might have a potential claim against \r\n  another, not when he develops a full-blown theory of recovery.\" Joubert, \r\n  341 S.C. at 190, 534 S.E.2d at 8. \r\nBayle attempts to distinguish this \r\n  case from Tanyel v. Osborne, 312 S.C. 473, 441 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App. 1994). The \r\n  facts in Tanyel involve a collision at an intersection. Tanyel was stopped at \r\n  a red light. Osborne entered the intersection and turned left in front of an \r\n  oncoming school bus driven by an employee of the Department of Education. The \r\n  bus hit Osborne's car pushing it into Tanyel's car. The accident occurred on \r\n  November 14, 1990. In early 1991, Tanyel brought an action against Osborne only. \r\n  In early December of 1992, Tanyel amended his complaint to add the bus driver \r\n  as a defendant when he discovered new evidence indicating negligence by the \r\n  bus driver. Tanyel alleged the statute did not begin to run until he \"discovered\" \r\n  evidence supporting a claim of negligence against the bus driver. The Court \r\n  determined the statute of limitations on Tanyel's claim against the school bus \r\n  driver began to run when Tanyel witnessed the events causing his loss, thereby \r\n  putting him on notice he might have a potential claim against another person, \r\n  not when he later discovered evidence to support his claim.\r\nBayle argues that, unlike Tanyel, \r\n  he did not witness the accident and did not have personal knowledge of the circumstances \r\n  surrounding it. Thus, he did not know of the loss on that date. This argument \r\n  is without merit.\r\nBayle was informed of his wife's \r\n  death on the day it occurred. The accident report read: \"[Patricia Bayle's car] \r\n  struck water on the road.\" Bayle therefore had knowledge of the circumstances \r\n  of the accident. In his brief, Bayle concedes he knew it was raining on the \r\n  day of his wife's accident and that Patricia's car struck a puddle of water. \r\n  It is unavailing that Bayle did not personally witness the accident.\r\nViewing the evidence, as we are constrained \r\n  to do, in the light most favorable to Bayle, the evidence does not demonstrate \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact existed that a person possessing common knowledge \r\n  and experience would not have known a possible cause of action existed \r\n  on the date of Patricia's tragic death. Bayle knew the circumstances of Patricia's \r\n  death and should have been on notice to investigate further.\r\nBayle proposes an interpretation \r\n  of the discovery rule that would require absolute certainty a cause of action \r\n  exists before the statute of limitations begins to run. However, that is not \r\n  the law of this state.\r\nBayle avers the question of whether \r\n  he was reasonably diligent in pursuing his claim is a jury issue that precluded \r\n  summary judgment. We disagree.\r\nReasonable diligence is intrinsically \r\n  tied to the issue of notice. The Joubert Court explicated: \"We have interpreted \r\n  the 'exercise of reasonable diligence' to mean that the injured party must act \r\n  with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury place a \r\n  reasonable person of common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim \r\n  against another party might exist.\" Joubert, 341 S.C. at 191, 534 S.E.2d \r\n  at 8 (quoting Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, \r\n  647 (1996)). See also Burgess v. American Cancer Soc'y, 300 S.C. 182, \r\n  386 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. 1989)(holding statute starts to run upon discovery \r\n  of such facts as would have led to knowledge thereof if pursued with reasonable \r\n  diligence).\r\nThere is no evidence in the record \r\n  that Bayle took any action within the two years after his wife's death. In contrast, \r\n  armed with the same information, Paul Wilson filed a Freedom of Information \r\n  Act request to determine if other accidents had occurred under similar circumstances.\r\nBayle asseverates the court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment because the court improperly found the alleged \r\n  defect in the road surface and the absence of a barrier were patent rather than \r\n  latent. In its order granting summary judgment, the court concluded: \"The existence \r\n  of water on the roadway and the absence of a barrier between the north [sic] \r\n  bound and south [sic] bound lanes of travel were readily observable conditions \r\n  on the date of the accident. These alleged 'defects' thus existed on the day \r\n  of this accident, i.e. the date the 'loss' occurred.\"\r\nThe cause of Bayle's loss \r\n  was not an issue of material fact with regard to the grant of summary judgment \r\n  and does not mandate reversal. Counsel for Bayle conceded at the hearing that \r\n  the defect was evident when it rains. The evidence showed it was raining at \r\n  the time of the accident. We agree with the Circuit Court's finding the lack \r\n  of a barrier on that portion of the interstate highway is immediately apparent.\r\nBayle cites Ford v. South Carolina \r\n  Department of Transportation, 328 S.C. 481, 492 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App. 1997), \r\n  for the proposition that the determination of whether a defect is latent or \r\n  patent is a jury issue. Ford is not controlling because it did not involve \r\n  the construction and interpretation of the Tort Claims Act's statute of limitations.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides potential \r\n  claimants with two years in which to file suits. This two year period begins \r\n  on the date of loss regardless of whether the plaintiff knows the cause \r\n  of the loss. Bayle's knowledge of his loss triggered the statute and put Bayle \r\n  on notice to timely investigate and determine its cause. Bayle's belated discovery \r\n  of the cause of the loss does not entitle him to reversal of the order granting \r\n  summary judgment. Bayle did not investigate sooner and did not file this claim \r\n  until more than two years from the date of his wife's death.\r\nII. Necessity of \r\n  Further Discovery\r\n Finally, \r\n  Bayle challenges the Circuit Court's grant of DOT's motion to quash further \r\n  discovery. Bayle maintains the court erred in granting summary judgment prior \r\n  to permitting him to complete discovery. We disagree.\r\nThe rulings of a trial judge in matters \r\n  involving discovery will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of \r\n  an abuse of discretion. Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 381 S.E.2d 734 (1989); \r\n  Osborne v. Adams, 338 S.C. 82, 525 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 1999). An abuse \r\n  of discretion occurs when the trial judge's ruling is based upon an error of \r\n  law or, when based on factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support. Fontaine \r\n  v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 354 S.E.2d 565 (1987); Osborne, supra.\r\nWe note initially that Bayle did \r\n  not move for a continuance in which to pursue further discovery. Therefore, \r\n  this issue is not preserved for review on appeal. See Degenhart v. Knights \r\n  of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 420 S.E.2d 495 (1992)(stating whether court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment while appellants had motion to compel outstanding \r\n  was not preserved when appellants failed to move for a continuance and did not \r\n  request motion for summary judgment be held in abeyance until after ruling on \r\n  discovery motion); Pryor v. Northwest Apartments, Ltd., 321 S.C. 524, \r\n  469 S.E.2d 630 (Ct. App. 1996)(holding that issue as to whether judge erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment because discovery requests were outstanding was \r\n  not preserved where appellant did not ask court to continue case so discovery \r\n  could be completed).\r\nBayle did not present argument regarding \r\n  the necessity for additional discovery until after the motion for summary judgment \r\n  had been granted. DOT briefly addressed the discovery issue in anticipation \r\n  of Bayle's response to its motion for summary judgment. This is insufficient \r\n  to preserve the issue for review. See 4 C.J.S. Appeal &amp; Error \r\n  Â§ 219 (1993)(\"As a general rule, the objection in the trial court must have \r\n  been made by the party who urges the error in the appellate court.\").\r\nAssuming, arguendo, this issue is \r\n  preserved, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in quashing \r\n  the motion for additional discovery and granting summary judgment. The record \r\n  in the case sub judice does not demonstrate further discovery would have contributed \r\n  to the resolution of the issue at hand--namely, whether the statute of limitations \r\n  barred Bayle's action. See Thomas v. Waters, 315 S.C. 524, 445 S.E.2d \r\n  659 (Ct. App. 1994)(affirming grant of summary judgment when plaintiff did not \r\n  demonstrate likelihood that further discovery would produce additional relevant \r\n  evidence).\r\n \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe rule that issues relating to the \r\n  cause of the loss rather than the date of the loss are not determinative. We \r\n  hold the clear legislative intent reveals the date of the loss, not the date \r\n  of the discovery of the cause of the loss, triggers the running of the statute \r\n  of limitations under the Tort Claims Act. Further discovery regarding the nature \r\n  of the alleged defect would not have affected the outcome of this case. Concomitantly, \r\n  the trial court properly granted DOT's motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the Circuit Court granting summary judgment is hereby\r\n\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  HEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., \r\n    concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3285","title":"Triple E, Inc. v.

(H&amp;D), alleging breach of express warranty,\r\nbreach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, breach of\r\nimplied warranty of merchantability, negligent misrepresentation and negligence.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict of $47,025 for Triple E. H&amp;D appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nTriple E is a family farm operated primarily by\r\nMarty Easler. In the early 1990s, Triple Eâ€™s principal crop was tobacco. In\r\n1994, Triple E purchased 8,000 pounds of Chlor-O-Pic.1\r\nChlor-O-Pic is a chemical fumigant used to suppress black shank disease. Black\r\nshank disease is a soil-boring fungal disease that destroys tobacco crops.\r\nEasler purchased Chlor-O-Pic after seeing full\r\nand half-page advertisements in the Carolina Farmer, a trade magazine.\r\nThe advertisements pictured a pair of dice and stated: &quot;Why gamble on your\r\ncrop when you can insure it with Chlor-O-Pic?&quot; The ads further stated:\r\n&quot;Proven control . . . University tests prove that for consistent, effective\r\ncontrol of Granville Wilt and Black Shank, you need 42 pounds of active\r\ningredient . . . at 3 gallons per acre. . . . Chlor-O-Pic gives you season long\r\ncontrol with application in fall, winter or spring.&quot;\r\nEasler used Chlor-O-Pic to treat approximately\r\n143 acres of his tobacco crop. Easler testified he applied the Chlor-O-Pic using\r\nthe correct machinery, with the correct application procedures, and in the\r\ncorrect amount. Nevertheless, Triple Eâ€™s crop developed black shank. Triple E\r\neventually lost ten acres, or an estimated 3,000 pounds of tobacco per acre, to\r\nblack shank.\r\nAt a trial held in 1994, Easler called J. K.\r\nMcCord as an expert witness in agricultural chemicals.2\r\nWhen asked about H&amp;Dâ€™s ad for Chlor-O-Pic, McCord testified the ad was\r\n&quot;vulgar&quot; because it was misleading by using the term &quot;proven\r\ncontrol.&quot; McCord testified chloropicrin was a good product for suppression,\r\nbut if applied as described in the ads, it could not control black shank\r\nthroughout a growing season, contrary to the adâ€™s claims. McCord testified a\r\nfarmer needed to apply chloropicrin as directed in the ads, but also needed to\r\nsupplement it with sufficient quantities of Ridomil twice during the season.\r\nMcCord testified Easler told him he had applied a small amount of Ridomil once\r\nduring the season, but McCord testified that the amount Easler used was\r\ninsufficient to combat black shank.\r\nEasler testified that in the farming world, the\r\nword control &quot;is a real strong word&quot; meaning prevention. Easler\r\ntestified he believed the ad to mean that Chlor-O-Pic would prevent his crop\r\nfrom getting black shank. Easler testified he relied on the adâ€™s claims when\r\npurchasing Chlor-O-Pic from H&amp;D and that he placed great reliance on the ad\r\nbecause the Carolina Farmer was a trade publication. He stated that the\r\nadâ€™s use of the words or phrases &quot;control,&quot; &quot;season long\r\ncontrol,&quot; and &quot;why gamble . . . when you can insure . . .&quot; all\r\nled him to believe that Chlor-O-Pic would prevent black shank the entire growing\r\nseason.\r\nAt the close of Triple Eâ€™s case, H&amp;D moved\r\nfor a directed verdict on all causes of action. The trial judge denied the\r\nmotion and submitted the case to the jury. The jury found for Triple E on all\r\ncauses of action and returned a general verdict in the amount of $47,025. The\r\ntrial judge denied H&amp;Dâ€™s post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding\r\nthe verdict.\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by\r\na jury, this court will correct errors of law and will not disturb a factual\r\nfinding of the jury unless a review of the record discloses no evidence to\r\nreasonably support the juryâ€™s findings.3 In\r\nreviewing motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the\r\nverdict, it is the duty of this court to view the evidence and all inferences\r\nthat may reasonably be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party.4 If more than one reasonable\r\ninference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the\r\njury.5\r\nAdditionally, this court may review an order on\r\nappeal under the &quot;two issue&quot; rule when the jury returns a general\r\nverdict involving two or more issues. If the juryâ€™s verdict is supported as to\r\nat least one issue, the verdict will not be reversed on appeal.6\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nH&amp;D argues the trial judge erred in finding a\r\nquestion of fact existed as to whether the advertisements in the Carolina\r\nFarmer constituted an express warranty. We disagree.\r\nThis action is governed by the Uniform Commercial\r\nCode (UCC), codified in Chapter 36 of our code.7\r\nSection 36-2-313 of the UCC states in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (1) Express warranties by the seller are\r\n  created as follows:\r\n  \r\n    (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise,\r\n    including those on containers or labels, made by the seller to the buyer,\r\n    whether directly or indirectly, which relates to the goods and becomes part\r\n    of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods\r\n    conform to the affirmation or promise.\r\n    (b) Any description of the goods which is\r\n    made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the\r\n    goods shall conform to the description.\r\n    . . .\r\n  \r\n  (2) It is not necessary to the creation of an\r\n  express warranty that the seller use formal words such as &quot;warrant&quot;\r\n  or &quot;guarantee&quot; or that he have a specific intention to make a\r\n  warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement\r\n  purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does\r\n  not create a warranty.8\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhether an affirmation creates an express\r\nwarranty or is merely the sellerâ€™s opinion or puffing is ordinarily a question\r\nof fact for the jury.9\r\n\r\nAlthough we have found no South Carolina case in\r\nwhich an advertisement created an express warranty, in Odom v. Ford Motor\r\nCompany10 our supreme court stated: &quot;There\r\nare cases where recovery has been allowed on the theory of express warranty . .\r\n. where the purchaser of an article relied on representations made by the\r\nmanufacturer in advertising material.&quot;11\r\nMoreover, other jurisdictions have held that affirmations made in advertisements\r\ncan give rise to express warranties.12\r\n\r\nIn the present case, Triple E presented evidence\r\nthat the assertions expressed in the advertisement met the definition of an\r\nexpress warranty. Easler and McCord testified the words &quot;proven\r\ncontrol&quot; constituted an affirmative statement in the farming community. The\r\nads stated that Chlor-O-Pic would provide &quot;season long control,&quot; a\r\nfact disputed by Triple Eâ€™s expert. Easler testified he saw the ads and relied\r\non them in purchasing Chlor-O-Pic. Finally, Mr. McLawhorn, an agent of H&amp;D,\r\nadmitted they intended the slogan &quot;Why gamble on your crops when you can\r\ninsure it with Chlor-O-Pic?&quot; to convey the message as stated.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable\r\nto Triple E, we find sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial\r\njudgeâ€™s conclusion that the issue of the express warranty was one for the\r\njury. Because the jury verdict is supported as to this issue, we decline to\r\naddress the juryâ€™s verdict on the remaining causes of action.\r\nH&amp;D next argues that Triple Eâ€™s recovery is\r\nlimited by H&amp;Dâ€™s exclusion of consequential and incidental damages.\r\nUnder South Carolina Code section 36-2-719,13\r\nparties may contractually modify or limit the recovery of consequential or\r\nincidental damages, provided the limitation is not unconscionable. Accordingly,\r\nwhere a proper exclusion of consequential and incidental damages is\r\ncontractually agreed to, a plaintiffâ€™s remedy is limited to his or her actual\r\ndamages as defined in South Carolina Code section 36-2-714(2).\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 36-2-714(2) states:\r\n\r\n  (2) The measure of damages for breach of\r\n  warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the\r\n  value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been\r\n  as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a\r\n  different amount.14\r\n  \r\n\r\nH&amp;D contend that because the parties\r\ncontractually agreed to exclude consequential and incidental damages under\r\nsection 36-2-714, Triple E is entitled to recover only the cost of the\r\nChlor-O-Pic. We disagree.\r\nIn Hill v. BASF Wyandotte Corporation,15\r\nour supreme court rejected a similar argument, stating:\r\n\r\n  This formula [under section\r\n  36-2-714(2)] is most appropriate where the nonconforming good can be repaired\r\n  or replaced and value (both as warranted and as accepted) can be defined with\r\n  certainty.\r\n  A herbicide failure is a latent\r\n  defect in the product. There is no reasonable way a farmer can determine in\r\n  advance whether a herbicide will perform as warranted. Discovery of the\r\n  problem must await the development of the crop at which time it is usually too\r\n  late to correct.\r\n  . . .\r\n  It has consistently been held\r\n  by this Court that the measure of actual damages, in cases similar to\r\n  this, is the value the crop would have had if the product had conformed to the\r\n  warranty less the value of the crop actually produced, less the expense of\r\n  preparing for market the portion of the probable crop prevented from maturing.\r\n  . . .\r\n  If the measure of damages we\r\n  have adopted includes an element of lost profits, such inclusion is merely\r\n  coincidental as the measure covers the direct loss resulting in the ordinary\r\n  course of events from the alleged breach of the warranty.16\r\n\r\nThus, under Hill, Triple E\r\nwas entitled to recover the value of the damaged crop.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n1Chlor-O-Pic is a\r\ntradename under which the pesticide chloropicrin is sold.\r\n2McCord viewed Easlerâ€™s\r\ndamaged tobacco fields and determined they contained a moderate incident of\r\nblack shank.\r\n3Townes Assocs.,\r\nLtd. v.

First Palmetto Savings Bank appeals. We reverse and remand. \r\n   (1)\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1989, Bhupendra Patel sold the Sumter \r\n  Tourist Lodge (the Property) to Nagarbhai K. Patel. (2) \r\n  In consideration, Nagarbhai executed a promissory note in favor of Bhupendra \r\n  in the amount of $260,000.00, secured by a wrap-around mortgage on the Property. \r\n  The wrap mortgage was subordinate to a mortgage given by Bhupendra to Fred and \r\n  E.W. Gee. Nagarbhai subsequently sold the Property to his son, Pradipkumar Patel. \r\n  With Bhupendra's consent, Pradipkumar assumed payments on the note and the wrap \r\n  mortgage Nagarbhai had given to Bhupendra.\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1988, Bhupendra borrowed $100,000.00 \r\n  from the National Bank of South Carolina (NBSC). As security for the loan, Bhupendra \r\n  executed and delivered to NBSC a promissory note together with a subordination \r\n  and collateral assignment of the wrap mortgage. To further secure the debt, \r\n  Pradipkumar, then the owner of the Property, executed a real estate mortgage \r\n  conveying a lien to NBSC. \r\n\r\nKen Hamilton served as the closing attorney for \r\n  Bhupendra, as borrower, and NBSC, as lender. Hamilton witnessed the execution \r\n  of the subordination and collateral assignment of the wrap mortgage and recorded \r\n  the document in the public records. Following this transaction, the first mortgage \r\n  lien on the Property was held by Fred and E.W. Gee; the second, by NBSC pursuant \r\n  to the mortgage executed by Pradipkumar; and the third, by Bhupendra, subject \r\n  to the subordination and collateral assignment to NBSC. \r\n\r\nIn January 1994, Bhupendra satisfied the obligation \r\n  to Fred and E.W. Gee. That mortgage was subsequently marked paid and cancelled \r\n  of record. Bhupendra also repaid the loan from NBSC, satisfying the mortgage \r\n  given by Pradipkumar to secure the debt. Bhupendra, however, neglected to contact \r\n  NBSC concerning the reassignment of the wrap mortgage he had assigned as collateral. \r\n  Following the January 1994, repayments, the wrap mortgage from Nagarbhai to \r\n  Bhupendra was the first and senior lien on the Property. \r\n\r\nIn March 1996, Pradipkumar arranged to receive \r\n  a loan from First Palmetto Savings Bank (First Palmetto). As security for the \r\n  loan, First Palmetto required a primary lien on the Property. Ken Hamilton served \r\n  as the closing attorney for the transaction. Hamilton's title search revealed \r\n  the outstanding wrap mortgage from Nagarbhai to Bhupendra, which had been assigned \r\n  to NBSC. Hamilton contacted NBSC and requested that it determine the status \r\n  of the mortgage, which Pradipkumar asserted had been satisfied some time earlier. \r\n  Neither Hamilton nor NBSC discovered that it was a collateral rather than absolute \r\n  assignment. \r\n\r\nOn April 30, 1996, without the knowledge or consent \r\n  of Bhupendra, an officer of NBSC executed a Satisfaction of Lost or Destroyed \r\n  Mortgage declaring the wrap mortgage paid in full and authorizing the Register \r\n  of Mesne Conveyances to cancel it from the records. (3) \r\n  Pradipkumar refinanced the mortgage with a loan of $200,000.00 from First Palmetto \r\n  in October 1996. Hamilton again served as the closing attorney.\r\n\r\nIn February1998, First Palmetto brought a foreclosure \r\n  action against Pradipkumar, asserting its mortgage was the primary lien on the \r\n  Property. Bhupendra filed an answer in the action and asserted counterclaims \r\n  and crossclaims to set aside NBSC's mistaken satisfaction of the wrap mortgage, \r\n  restore it to first priority, and foreclose. \r\n\r\nThe action was referred to the master-in-equity \r\n  for final judgment with any appeal to be directly to the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court. The master concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [A]ttorney Hamilton was attorney and agent for \r\n    [First Palmetto] and . . . had knowledge of the true facts regarding the nature \r\n    of Bhupendra Patel's subordination and assignment of mortgage from the former \r\n    transaction, or obtained sufficient knowledge of facts during the course of \r\n    the second and third loan closing transactions to have placed him on inquiry \r\n    notice to further investigate the nature of the assignment. Therefore, attorney \r\n    Hamilton's knowledge is imputed to [First Palmetto] and [First Palmetto] is \r\n    not an innocent third party who would be prejudiced by the restoration of \r\n    Defendant Bhupendra Patel's mortgage to its rightful priority.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe master then canceled the mistaken satisfaction, \r\n  restored and reinstated Bhupendra's wrap mortgage to first priority, and granted \r\n  foreclosure. The master also found that Bhupendra's failure to seek re-assignment \r\n  of the wrap mortgage was not the proximate cause of the mistaken satisfaction. \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAn action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is \r\n  one in equity. (4) As such, this court may find \r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  (5)  \r\n\r\n First Palmetto initially argues the master erred \r\n  in imputing to it knowledge obtained by Hamilton in the February, 1988 loan \r\n  closing concerning the collateral nature of the wrap mortgage. We agree.\r\n\r\n Equitable principles may be applied to cancel \r\n  a mortgage satisfaction. (6) Specifically, \"'when \r\n  the legal rights of the parties have been changed by mistake, equity restores \r\n  them to their former condition, when it can be done without interfering with \r\n  any new rights acquired on the faith and strength of the altered condition of \r\n  the legal rights, and without doing injustice to other parties.'\" \r\n  (7) Thus, a mortgage that has been mistakenly satisfied may be reinstated \r\n  only where there is no third party who, without notice of the mistake, subsequently \r\n  and in good faith acquires an interest in the property. \r\n  (8)\r\n\r\nThe master found that as a result of Hamilton's \r\n  involvement in the February, 1988 loan closing he obtained knowledge of the \r\n  true collateral nature of the assignment. The master then found that this knowledge \r\n  was imputed to First Palmetto as a result of the principal-agent relationship \r\n  formed in March, 1996. \r\n\r\nGenerally a principal is charged with the knowledge \r\n  an agent acquired prior to the formation of the agency only when it is clearly \r\n  shown that the knowledge was in the mind of the agent while acting for the principal \r\n  or where he acquired it so recently as to raise the presumption he still retained \r\n  it in his mind. (9) Because Hamilton's representation \r\n  of First Palmetto occurred eight years after his participation in the 1988 transaction, \r\n  any presumption of retention must fail. Accordingly, any knowledge that Hamilton \r\n  may have acquired in 1988 cannot be imputed to First Palmetto unless it is clearly \r\n  shown that the information was in Hamilton's mind while he served as First Palmetto's \r\n  agent.\r\n\r\nHamilton testified that he remembered little of \r\n  the 1988 transaction. His file concerning the transaction was listed under Pradipkumar's \r\n  name rather than Bhupendra's. Although the subordination and assignment agreement \r\n  was stamped with Hamilton's address, he could not remember if he had prepared \r\n  it. When asked on cross examination whether he believed that the assignment \r\n  was absolute when he contacted NBSC, Hamilton responded: \"I do not know. All \r\n  I know is that N.B.S.C. held the mortgage at that time, because that is what \r\n  the public records indicate and that is why we asked N.B.S.C. to assign estoppel.\" \r\n  Hamilton later stated: \"The only thing that I apparently concerned myself [sic] \r\n  or my office did was the fact that N.B.S.C. held an Assignment of Mortgage and \r\n  that N.B.S.C. would have to do a satisfaction.\" \r\n\r\nHamilton admitted that when checking the public \r\n  record for his title opinion in 1996, he would have discovered that he had been \r\n  involved with the subordination and assignment agreement. He further testified \r\n  that when he was preparing for the 1996 closing between Pradipkumar and First \r\n  Palmetto, he would have probably recognized the name and may have checked the \r\n  1988 file to see the identity of the parties and the property involved. He stated, \r\n  however, that he doubted he would have checked the file specifically with the \r\n  wrap mortgage in mind. He explained that it would have been highly unlikely \r\n  for him to remember the details of the 1988 transaction when he closed the loans \r\n  for First Palmetto. \r\n\r\nWe find no evidence that at the time of the 1996 \r\n  closings Hamilton had present in his mind the knowledge that the assignment \r\n  of the wrap mortgage was collateral rather than absolute. Additionally, we find \r\n  no evidence from the document itself that would have or should have brought \r\n  the details of the 1988 transaction to the forefront of Hamilton's mind. The \r\n  subordination and collateral assignment agreement appears on its face to be \r\n  an absolute assignment of the mortgage. The agreement contains no language that \r\n  the mortgage would be reassigned upon payment of debts owed to NBSC. Although \r\n  Hamilton may have remembered that he had been involved with the recording of \r\n  the subordination and assignment agreement, he denied checking his 1988 file \r\n  with the wrap mortgage in mind. We find nothing so peculiar about the subordination \r\n  and assignment agreement that would have mandated Hamilton check his 1988 file \r\n  before proceeding with the 1996 closing. We, therefore, hold that the master \r\n  erred in imputing knowledge of the collateral nature of the assignment to First \r\n  Palmetto.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the cancellation of the \r\n  mortgage satisfaction and the reinstatement of the wrap mortgage to first priority. \r\n  (10) We remand the case for foreclosure of the mortgages in accordance \r\n  with this opinion.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. Because oral argument would \r\n  not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without \r\n  oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n2.  Bhupendra Patel and Nagarbhai \r\n  Patel are not related. \r\n3.  Bhupendra became aware that \r\n  his mortgage had been wrongly satisfied in 1997 when he applied for a loan from \r\n  Branch Banking &amp; Trust Company of South Carolina (BB&amp;T) intending to \r\n  use the mortgage as collateral. NBSC admitted at trial that it did not have \r\n  the authority to satisfy the mortgage. \r\n 4. Dockside Ass'n v. Detyens, \r\n  294 S.C. 86, 362 S.E.2d 874 (1987); MI Co. v.

Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: John Thomas Robinson \r\n  was indicted for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and possession \r\n  of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within proximity of a public playground \r\n  or park. A jury found Robinson guilty. He was sentenced to twenty years and \r\n  a fine of $25,000 for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and \r\n  a concurrent fifteen year term for the related proximity charge.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nCalvin's Detail Shop (Calvin's) was the focal point \r\n  of a six-month drug investigation by the Rock Hill Police Department and the \r\n  Federal Bureau of Investigations. On the evening of October 13, 1998, Rock Hill \r\n  Police Officers Floyd and Lubben conducted surveillance of Calvin's. Both officers \r\n  saw Robinson get out of a vehicle, enter Calvin's and exit on foot a short time \r\n  later. The officers approached Robinson on the sidewalk. When Officer Floyd \r\n  identified himself, Robinson charged him and threw his hands up in the air. \r\n  Officer Lubben saw a black plastic bag fly from Robinson's left hand. The black \r\n  plastic bag contained seven rocks of crack cocaine, having a total weight of \r\n  0.9 grams. Robinson was arrested and charged with possession with intent to \r\n  distribute and the related proximity charge.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the State's case, Robinson \r\n  moved for a directed verdict arguing the State had presented no evidence of \r\n  an intent to distribute. The trial judge denied the motion. Robinson appeals \r\n  both convictions. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nCounsel for Robinson initially filed a brief pursuant \r\n  to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), asserting there was no \r\n  meritorious grounds for appeal and requesting permission to withdraw from further \r\n  representation. In addition, Robinson filed a pro se brief. This Court \r\n  denied counsel's request to withdraw and directed the parties to brief the directed \r\n  verdict issue raised by Robinson in his pro se brief. We find all other \r\n  issues contained in counsel's initial Anders brief and Robinson's pro \r\n  se brief to be without merit.\r\n\r\nRobinson argues the trial court erred in denying \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on the charge of possession with \r\n  intent to distribute because the amount seized was less than the statutory amount \r\n  triggering the permissible inference of an intent to distribute, and no other \r\n  evidence of intent was presented. See S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (Supp. \r\n  1999). We disagree.\r\n\r\nOn a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal \r\n  case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight. State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 319 S.E.2d 335 (1984). \r\n  When reviewing the denial of a directed verdict motion in a criminal case we \r\n  determine if there is \"any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused.\" State v. \r\n  Rowell, 326 S.C. 313, 315, 487 S.E.2d 185, 186, (1997), cert. denied, \r\n  522 U.S. 923 (1997). If so, this Court must find that the case was properly \r\n  submitted to the jury. Id. On appeal from the denial of a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict this Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State. \r\n  State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 1999) creates \r\n  a permissive inference that possession of more than one gram of crack cocaine \r\n  constitutes possession with intent to distribute. However, a conviction of possession \r\n  with intent to distribute does not hinge upon the amount involved. State \r\n  v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 352 S.E.2d 483 (1987); State v. Simpson, \r\n  275 S.C. 426, 272 S.E.2d 431 (1980). Furthermore, the statute does not mandate \r\n  a reverse inference or presumption for amounts less than one gram.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial, the State presented expert testimony \r\n  from police officers that it was not typical for a simple user of crack cocaine \r\n  to possess seven rocks of crack cocaine at one time. Two police officers testified \r\n  users typically possess one rock, or at most, two. One officer stated he would \r\n  not expect a dealer to have scales or individual baggies in his possession, \r\n  but he would expect to find the crack cocaine wrapped as it was in this case.\r\n\r\nBased upon this testimony, we conclude there is \r\n  sufficient evidence of Robinson's intent to distribute to withstand the directed \r\n  verdict. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the \r\n  circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, HOWARD, and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3288","title":"Bob Jones University v.

I hereby declare that I have considered my children, and have decided to dispose of my estate\r\nas stated herein due to numerous circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe will did not include a residuary clause or any other devise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNimmons had a life insurance policy in the amount of $156,000.  His estate was named the beneficiary.  His estate also\r\nincluded various items of personal property valued at $4,753.71 and $246.97 in cash.\r\n\r\nThree of Nimmons' four children (\"the Children\") brought this action for construction of the will.  The Children asserted the\r\ncash, the proceeds from the life insurance policy, and any asset that could be identified and located, except personal and\r\nhousehold effects, should pass to them by way of intestacy.  They additionally requested the court bar Bob Jones University\r\nfrom paying from the residuary estate its attorneys' fees incurred in this action.  The Children also sought a court order\r\nrequiring Appellants to provide them with a list of assets removed from the house Nimmons rented at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nThe Children filed a motion in limine, asking \r\n  the court exclude extrinsic evidence at the hearing on the petition to construe \r\n  the will. As support for their motion, the Children asserted Appellants were \r\n  in default because they did not timely answer the petition for construction \r\n  of the will. They additionally argued extrinsic evidence was not admissible \r\n  to prove intent under the circumstances of this case.\r\n\r\nThe Probate Court conducted a hearing on the motion \r\n  in limine. The court set aside the entry of default. It found, however, \r\n  the will did not contain any latent ambiguity that would allow the court to \r\n  consider testimony or other evidence regarding Nimmons' intent. Accordingly, \r\n  the court held Appellants were precluded from introducing extrinsic evidence \r\n  regarding Nimmons' intent in making his will.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent hearing, the Probate Court allowed Appellants to proffer the extrinsic evidence it previously excluded.  Marvin\r\nHembry, one of the witnesses to the will, testified Nimmons told him he was leaving his estate to Bob Jones because someone\r\nat the university had treated him well.  Hembry stated Nimmons did not mention his children at all.\r\n\r\nAs well, Appellants proffered the testimony of Charles Hofstra.  Hofstra was the attorney who drafted the will.  In his\r\ntestimony, Hofstra averred his understanding was that because Nimmons had no real estate and Bob Jones University was to be\r\nthe recipient of the entire estate, no residuary clause was needed.  He explained he thought Item III would cover the entire\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nIn its final order, the Probate Court reiterated the will contained no latent ambiguity that would allow the court to consider\r\nextrinsic evidence of Nimmons' intent.  It held the life insurance proceeds did not fall within the general classification of\r\nproperty described in Item III of the will.  It concluded that as the will disposed of only part of the estate and had no residuary\r\nclause, there was a partial intestacy.  Therefore, the proceeds of the life insurance would pass by intestacy to Nimmons' four\r\nchildren.  The court additionally ordered Barton to furnish the Children with a detailed list of the property removed from the\r\nhouse in which Nimmons lived at the time of his death.  Appellants appealed to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the Probate\r\nCourt's decision.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis is an action at law. NationsBank of South \r\nCarolina v. Greenwood, 321 S.C. 386, 468 S.E.2d 658 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding \r\nan action to construe a will is an action at law). If a proceeding in the Probate \r\nCourt is in the nature of an action at law, review by the Circuit Court and this \r\nCourt extends merely to the correction of errors of law. See Townes \r\nAssocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976) (stating \r\nappellate review of an action at law is limited to correcting errors of law). \r\nThe factual findings of the Probate Court will not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\na review of the record reveals there is no evidence reasonably supporting the \r\ncourt's findings. Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 434 S.E.2d 254 (1993). \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Probate Court err by concluding Nimmons' will did not contain any ambiguity, thus precluding the introduction of\r\nextrinsic evidence regarding Nimmons' intent when drafting the document?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the Probate Court erred in ruling no ambiguity exists in Nimmons' will.  We disagree.\r\nThe cardinal rule of will construction is the determination \r\n  of the testator's intent. Matter of Clark, 308 S.C. 328, 417 S.E.2d 856 \r\n  (1992). In construing the language of a will, the reviewing tribunal must give \r\n  the words contained in the document their ordinary and plain meaning unless \r\n  it is clear the testator intended a different sense or such meaning would lead \r\n  to an inconsistency with the testator's declared intention. In re Estate \r\n  of Fabian, 326 S.C. 349, 483 S.E.2d 474 (Ct. App. 1997). In construing a \r\n  will, a court's first reference is always to the will's language itself. Fenzel \r\n  v. Floyd, 289 S.C. 495, 347 S.E.2d 105 (Ct. App. 1986). Where the will's \r\n  terms or provisions are ambiguous, the court may resort to extrinsic evidence \r\n  to resolve the ambiguity. Id.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of ambiguities found in construing wills:\r\n\r\n\r\nAmbiguities ... are patent and latent; the distinction being that in the former case the uncertainty is one which arises upon the\r\nwords of the ... instrument as looked at in themselves, and before any attempt is made to apply them to the object which they\r\ndescribe, while in the latter case the uncertainty arises, not upon the words of the ... instrument as looked at in themselves, but\r\nupon those words when applied to the object or subject which they describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabian, 326 S.C. at 353, 483 S.E.2d at 476 \r\n  (quoting Jennings v. Talbert, 77 S.C. 454, 456, 58 S.E. 420, 421 (1907)).\r\n\r\n A court may admit extrinsic evidence to determine \r\n  whether a latent ambiguity exists. Id. Once the court finds a latent \r\n  ambiguity, extrinsic evidence is also permitted to help the court determine \r\n  the testator's intent. Id.\r\n\r\nAppellants assert the distinction between latent \r\n  and patent ambiguities is no longer viable. We find no indication this distinction \r\n  has been abandoned by our courts. We hold the law as set forth in In re Estate \r\n  of Fabian is still valid in this state. Furthermore, Appellants concede \r\n  that any ambiguity in the will would be latent. Accordingly, their argument \r\n  concerning the existence of a distinction between latent and patent ambiguities \r\n  is irrelevant to our determination of whether the Probate Court erred in failing \r\n  to consider extrinsic evidence of Nimmons' intent.\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the will is internally inconsistent \r\n  and therefore ambiguous because Item II directs payment of estate taxes from \r\n  the residuary estate when there is no residuary clause. A \"residuary estate,\" \r\n  however, is not the equivalent of a \"residuary clause.\" Compare Black's \r\n  Law Dictionary 1309 (6th ed. 1990) (\"residuary clause\" is a \"[c]lause in \r\n  [a] will by which that part of property is disposed of which remains after satisfying \r\n  bequests and devises.\") with Cornelson v. Vance, 220 S.C. 47, \r\n  54, 66 S.E.2d 421, 424 (1951) (defining \"residuary estate\" as \"[A]ll property \r\n  owned by [the decedent] at the time of â€¦ death, other than that passing under \r\n  the Will â€¦.\"). A testator may have a \"residuary estate\" even though the will \r\n  contains no \"residuary clause.\" When a testator fails to include a residuary \r\n  clause in the will, the law provides for the distribution of that portion of \r\n  the estate not disposed of by will as intestate property. See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 62-2-101 (1987) (\"Any part of the estate of a decedent not effectively \r\n  disposed of by his will passes to his heirs as prescribed [by the sections concerning \r\n  intestate succession].\"); Cornelson, 220 S.C. at 58, 66 S.E.2d at 426 \r\n  (stating that if the testator does not choose to devise property by express \r\n  provision in the testator's will, the testator may dispose of assets by use \r\n  of a residuary clause -- when no such clause exists, disposition will be accomplished \r\n  via the laws of intestacy). Although the law engages a presumption against intestacy, \r\n  this presumption may be overcome by the facts and plain language of the testator's \r\n  will. Albergotti v. Summers, 203 S.C. 137, 26 S.E.2d 395 (1943); In \r\n  re Estate of Blankenship, 336 S.C. 103, 518 S.E.2d 615 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n The proceeds of the life insurance policy are clearly not within the classification of \"personal and household effects of every\r\nkind, including, but not limited to, furniture, appliances, furnishings, pictures, silverware, china, glass, vehicles, and all policies\r\nof fire, burglary, property damage, and other insurance on or in connection with the use of this property\" devised in Item III,\r\nwhich is the only devise in the will.  Nimmons made no attempt to avoid a partial intestacy through a residuary clause.  We find\r\nno indication Nimmons intended to disinherit his children.\r\n\r\nThe Probate Court permitted Appellants to proffer witness testimony concerning the drafting of Nimmons' will.  This evidence\r\nwas extrinsic.  We find no evidence of a latent ambiguity from the profferred testimony.\r\n\r\nBecause we find no ambiguity in the will when considering \r\n  the proffered evidence, we hold the Probate Court's failure to consider extrinsic \r\n  evidence in determining the existence of a latent ambiguity was harmless. See \r\n  McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (ruling appellant seeking reversal must show both error and prejudice).\r\n\r\nLastly, this Court cannot hold the failure to specifically \r\n  devise the proceeds of the life insurance or to include a residuary clause in \r\n  the will was merely a \"scrivener's error.\" Cf. Fenzel v. Floyd, \r\n  289 S.C. 495, 347 S.E.2d 105 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding extrinsic evidence is \r\n  also admissible to prove and correct a scrivener's error). \"Courts cannot make \r\n  wills nor can they conjecture as to the intention of the [testator].\" Cornelson, \r\n  220 S.C. at 58, 66 S.E.2d at 426.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find no latent ambiguity in the will.  The Probate Court did not err in refusing to consider extrinsic evidence of Nimmons'\r\nintent.  Additionally, we hold the Probate Court did not commit reversible error by failing to evaluate Appellant's extrinsic\r\nevidence for purposes of discovering the existence of any latent ambiguity in Nimmons' will.\r\nConsidering only the plain\r\nlanguage of the will, we hold the proceeds of the life insurance policy are not \"personal and household effects,\" as devised in\r\nItem III.  The insurance proceeds, therefore, are part of the residuary estate.  Because the will does not include a residuary\r\nclause, the residuary estate passes by intestacy. Accordingly, the Probate Court\r\ndid not err in ruling the proceeds of the life insurance policy passed by intestacy to Nimmons' children.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3289","title":"Olsen v.

(\"Faculty House\"). The \r\ncourt found Olson's action against the University was barred by the statute of \r\nlimitations. In awarding summary judgment to Faculty House, the court held Olson \r\nfailed to demonstrate a violation of the South Carolina Handicapped Accessibility \r\nAct, specifically S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-260. (1) \r\nFaculty House appeals the denial of its cross motion for summary judgment on Olson's \r\ncommon law negligence action. We affirm as addressed. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nSusan Olson has suffered from polio since childhood. \r\n  At the time of the accident giving rise to these actions, she walked with the \r\n  aid of crutches. On November 6, 1995, Olson was in The Faculty House, which \r\n  is situated on the University's Columbia campus, when her right crutch encountered \r\n  an unknown liquid on the floor and slipped out from under her. The Faculty House \r\n  is a dining club operated by Faculty House in a building leased to it by the \r\n  University. Olson did not fall, but in maintaining her balance, she tore her \r\n  left rotator cuff and sustained other injuries. As a result, Olson is now confined \r\n  to a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nOlson filed a tort action against Faculty House \r\n  on March 4, 1997. When Olson later discovered the University owned the premises \r\n  on which the Faculty House operates, she sought to add the University as a defendant \r\n  by motion dated January 22, 1998. The University answered asserting the statute \r\n  of limitations as a bar and subsequently moved for summary judgment.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 1998, the Circuit Court granted \r\n  the University's motion for summary judgment dismissing it from the action. \r\n  Olson did not immediately appeal this ruling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Olson pursued her actions against Faculty \r\n  House for a violation of Â§ 10-5-260 and common law negligence. Section 10-5-260 \r\n  is a provision in this state's chapter governing the accessibility of public \r\n  and governmental buildings to the disabled. \r\n\r\nFaculty House moved for summary judgment on both \r\n  causes of action. The Circuit Court concluded Olson failed to demonstrate a \r\n  violation of a duty of care under state handicapped accessibility regulations \r\n  as a matter of law. The court dismissed Olson's cause of action based on these \r\n  regulations. However, the court found sufficient questions of material fact \r\n  existed to preclude summary judgment on the common law negligence action. Faculty \r\n  House appeals this ruling.\r\n\r\nOlson appeals the earlier grant of summary judgment \r\n  to the University and the grant of summary judgment to Faculty House.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999); Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck \r\n  Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999); Young v. \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999); see also Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, \r\n  501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998) (a trial court should grant motion for summary \r\n  judgment when pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law). \r\n  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists so as to preclude summary \r\n  judgment, the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom must be \r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); Pye v. \r\n  Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997). If triable issues \r\n  exist, those issues must go to the jury for consideration. Rothrock v. Copeland, \r\n  305 S.C. 402, 409 S.E.2d 366 (1991); Joubert v. South Carolina Dep't of Soc. \r\n  Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n All actions in negligence require proof of: duty; \r\n  breach; causation; and damages. \r\n\r\nTo prevail in an action founded in negligence, \r\n  the plaintiff must establish three essential elements: (1) a duty of care owed \r\n  by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent \r\n  act or omission; and (3) damage proximately caused by a breach of duty. If the \r\n  plaintiff fails to prove any one of these elements, the action will fail. Actionable \r\n  negligence is based upon the breach of duty to do or refrain from doing some \r\n  particular act. A breach of duty exists when it is foreseeable that one's conduct \r\n  may likely injure the person to whom the duty is owed. The damages allegedly \r\n  sustained must be shown to have been proximately caused, i.e. causally connected, \r\n  to the breach of duty in order to warrant a recovery. If one neglects a duty \r\n  which proximately causes injury to another, recovery is warranted. \r\n\r\nVinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 399-400, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 715, 720 (Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nI. Olson's Appeal \r\n  of Summary Judgment in Favor of Faculty House \r\n  (2)\r\n\r\nOlson raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  Did she establish Faculty House violated American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards?\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Does the Handicapped Accessibility Act create a higher duty of care than the common law?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-260 give rise to \r\n      a private cause of action permitting the recovery of monetary damages?\r\n      \r\n\r\n    Did Olson establish Faculty House's alleged \r\n      violation of the Handicapped Accessibility Act proximately caused her injury?\r\n  \r\n\r\nA. Duty &amp; Breach\r\n\r\nWe first address Olson's argument that the South \r\n  Carolina Handicapped Accessibility Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 10-5-210 to -330, \r\n  established Faculty House's duty of care and this duty was higher than that \r\n  required by common law. We then turn to whether Olson presented evidence Faculty \r\n  House breached any alleged duty under the Handicapped Accessibility Act.\r\n\r\nOlson maintains the court erred in finding she \r\n  failed to establish the Faculty House violated the Handicapped Accessibility \r\n  Act. Olson specifically argues: (1) ANSI standards regarding the recommended \r\n  coefficient of friction apply to wet floors, as well as dry; and (2) Faculty \r\n  House failed to properly maintain the floor's elements and components in a safe \r\n  and usable condition. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, the General Assembly enacted legislation \r\n  for the construction of public buildings in such a manner as to make them accessible \r\n  to physically disabled persons. Act No. 174, 1963 Acts 189. Eleven years later, \r\n  the legislature acted again by passing the Handicapped Accessibility Act:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The General Assembly hereby declares that it shall \r\n    henceforth be the policy of this State to encourage and enable persons who \r\n    are physically handicapped to achieve maximum personal independence; to become \r\n    gainfully employed; to use and enjoy all governmental buildings and facilities \r\n    and all public buildings and facilities; and to otherwise participate fully \r\n    in all aspects of society. The General Assembly resolves to enact legislation \r\n    necessary to implement this policy and the purpose of this article is to begin \r\n    this implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. 1171, 1974 Acts 2794 (codified as Code \r\n  1962, Â§ 1-491 (Supp. 1975) &amp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-230 (1986 &amp; Supp. \r\n  1999)).\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this goal, the legislature created \r\n  the South Carolina Board for Barrier-Free Design (\"Board\"). Id. (codified \r\n  as Code 1962, Â§ 1-493 (Supp. 1975) &amp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-230 (1986 &amp; \r\n  Supp. 1999)). The Board's duties include the establishment, publication, and \r\n  enforcement of minimum standards and specifications for the removal of architectural \r\n  barriers to the handicapped in government and public buildings. See id. \r\n  (codified as Code 1962, Â§ 1-495(1) (Supp. 1975) &amp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-250(1) \r\n  (1986 &amp; Supp. 1999) (\"In this connection the Board shall adopt the latest \r\n  revisions of the Standard Building Code and the American National Standards \r\n  Institute specifications A117.1 with such modifications as the Board shall deem \r\n  appropriate.\").\r\n\r\nPursuant to the authority granted to it, the Board \r\n  adopted ANSI specifications in its regulations. 23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-400.2(B)(1), \r\n  as initially promulgated, stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The provisions of these rules and regulations \r\n    may not adequately provide for every contingency relating to barriers for \r\n    the handicapped. In situations not contemplated by the provisions of \r\n    these rules and regulations, compliance with the Standard \"Specifications \r\n    for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible To, and Usable By the Physically \r\n    Handicapped,\" American National Standards Institute (ANSI), A117.1 (1961 R.71) \r\n    shall be evidence of compliance with the intent of these rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe Board significantly revised Regulation 19-400 \r\n  in 1983. Nevertheless, reference to and reliance upon ANSI specifications continue \r\n  to pervade the regulation:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Every building or structure shall have all \r\n    levels and areas made accessible to the physically handicapped in accordance \r\n    with American National Standards Institute, Inc., \"Providing Accessibility \r\n    and Usability for Physically Handicapped People\", ANSI A117.1 â€¦ and \r\n    the requirements of this section â€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\n23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-400.1(1) (Supp. 1999) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Terms and definitions contained in ANSI A117.1 \r\n    are herein incorporated by reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-400.2(3) (Supp. 1999) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOver the years, ANSI standards have changed and \r\n  the parties in the instant case disagree as to the applicable set of ANSI standards. \r\n  None of the ANSI guidelines presented include a recommended coefficient of friction. \r\n  The 1961 ANSI guidelines merely require floors to have a \"nonslip\" surface. \r\n  See 1961 ANSI A117.1, Â§5.5.1. The 1992 ANSI guideline A117.1, Â§4.5.1 \r\n  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Slip resistance is based on a frictional \r\n    force necessary to keep a shoe or crutch tip from slipping on a walking surface \r\n    under the conditions of use likely to be found on the surface. Although \r\n    it is known that the static coefficient of friction is one basis of slip resistance, \r\n    there is not as yet a generally accepted method to evaluate the slip resistance \r\n    of walking surfaces for all use conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nANSI guidelines generally specify that floors \"shall \r\n  be stable, firm, and slip resistant, and shall comply with 4.5.\" Id.\r\n\r\nViewing the record in the light most favorable \r\n  to Olson, there is no evidence Faculty House violated an ANSI standard or any \r\n  other applicable standard regarding floor surfaces. Olson's expert witness, \r\n  Bryan Durig, testified he knew of no ANSI minimum baseline coefficient of friction \r\n  for a wet floor. Furthermore, Durig admitted he knew of no minimum baseline \r\n  published for a wet floor. He conceded the American Disability Act (\"ADA\") standards \r\n  were not in existence in 1976 when the Faculty House was renovated. Durig further \r\n  averred that based on test results, the floor would not have been unreasonably \r\n  dangerous had it been dry. \r\n\r\nOlson presented evidence regarding standards from \r\n  the Occupational Safety Health Act (OSHA) and ADA. Ronald Steinaker, P.E., an \r\n  expert, acknowledged there is no consensus as to whether the OSHA standard of \r\n  .5 refers to a wet or dry floor. He further admitted there is no consensus as \r\n  to whether the ADA recommended coefficient of friction of .6 applies to wet \r\n  or dry floors. \r\n\r\nSteinaker tested the floor of the Faculty House \r\n  and determined it to have a coefficient of friction when dry of .61. This would \r\n  satisfy OSHA standards and even ADA standards, although they are not applicable. \r\n  After removing sealer and or wax from the floor, Steinaker found it to have \r\n  a .55 coefficient of friction when dry.\r\n\r\nOlson contends the Faculty House failed to properly \r\n  maintain a structural or building element or component in a safe and usable \r\n  condition as required by Â§ 10-5-260. Section 10-5-260 provides: \"It is the responsibility \r\n  of the owner or the occupant of any property which contains structural or building \r\n  elements or components required to be in compliance with this article, to continuously \r\n  maintain these elements and components in a condition that is safe and usable \r\n  by handicapped persons at all times.\" Olson, however, presented no testimony \r\n  that the surface material of a floor is a structural or building element as \r\n  intended by the legislature. The quintessence of statutory construction is legislative \r\n  intent. Hodges v. Rainey, Op. No. 25149 (S.C.Sup.Ct. filed June 12, 2000) \r\n  (Shearouse Adv.Sh. No. 24 at 41). While Â§ 10-5-260 may evidence a duty with \r\n  respect to maintenance of the structural elements of buildings, we do not find \r\n  it establishes a duty with regard to the floor surface material.\r\n\r\nAssuming, arguendo, Â§ 10-5-260 does manifest \r\n  some duty concerning the floor, Olson did not present any evidence Faculty House \r\n  failed to maintain the floor elements in a \"safe and usable\" condition. Olson's \r\n  sole argument is that the floor was not properly maintained because liquid was \r\n  on it. We find the plain and ordinary meaning of \"maintain\" under Â§ 10-5-260 \r\n  refers to the safety of the structural elements of the floor, not to the presence \r\n  of a liquid on its surface.\r\n\r\nWe conclude Olson failed to present any evidence \r\n  Faculty House violated ANSI, ADA, OSHA, or other standards or regulations regarding \r\n  nonslip floors or that the floor material itself was defective or improperly \r\n  maintained. \r\n\r\nOlson argues the language of Â§ 10-5-260 creates \r\n  a higher standard of care than that required under common law and the court \r\n  failed to recognize this. However, she cites no case law in support of her assertion. \r\n  She instead relies solely on a paragraph from 57A Am. Jur. 2d Negligence \r\n  Â§ 199:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Persons who are known to have mental or physical \r\n    disabilities, or who are young and inexperienced, are entitled to a degree \r\n    of care exercised by others proportioned to their incapacity to protect themselves. \r\n    They are not to be accorded the same treatment as persons of mature years \r\n    and of sound mentality. No general rule can be articulated, for the standard \r\n    of care in situations involving victims having these characteristics requires \r\n    that a determination of what constitutes \"reasonable care\" be made in each \r\n    individual case, taking into consideration the victim's known mental and physical \r\n    condition. Generally, the greater the disability, the greater is the degree \r\n    of care required.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a general section and does not address \r\n  statutory standards of care. It is not enlightening on the duty of care owed \r\n  under the Handicapped Accessibility Act.\r\n\r\nThe common law regarding the duty of a business \r\n  person to the business' patrons is well-established:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [A] merchant is not an insurer of the safety of \r\n    a customer in his store. His duty is to exercise due care to keep his premises \r\n    in reasonably safe condition. Proof that a dangerous condition of the floor \r\n    existed because of the presence of some foreign matter thereon is insufficient, \r\n    standing alone, to support a finding of negligence. Unless it is inferable \r\n    from the evidence that the storekeeper was responsible for creating the hazard, \r\n    knowledge of its existence, either actual or constructive, is essential to \r\n    recovery against him. The defendant will be charged with constructive notice \r\n    whenever it appears that the condition has existed for such length of time \r\n    prior to the injury that, under existing circumstances, he should have discovered \r\n    and remedied it in the exercise of due care; conversely, absent evidence of \r\n    such preexistence, the defendant may not be so charged. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., \r\n  257&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;75, 77, 184 S.E.2d 77, 77 (1971) (citing Hunter v. Dixie \r\n  Home Stores, 232 S.C. 139, 101 S.E.2d 262 (1957); Gilliland v. Pierce \r\n  Motor Co., 235 S.C. 268, 111 S.E.2d 521 (1959); Wimberly v. Winn-Dixie \r\n  Greenville, Inc., 252 S.C. 117, 165 S.E.2d 627 (1969); Pennington v. \r\n  Zayre Corp., 252 S.C. 176, 165 S.E.2d 695 (1969)).\r\n\r\nThe determination of legislative intent is a matter \r\n  of law. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 \r\n  S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995). If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, \r\n  and articulates a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or \r\n  impose another meaning. Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, \r\n  454 S.E.2d 890 (1995). Where the provisions of a statute are clear, the court \r\n  must apply those terms according to their literal meaning. Id. The appellate \r\n  court cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary meaning, \r\n  and may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or \r\n  expand a statute's scope. Id.; see also Timmons v. South \r\n  Carolina Tricentennial Comm'n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970) (where \r\n  the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite \r\n  the statute and inject matters into it that are not in the legislature's language).\r\n\r\nA rule of statutory construction is that any legislation \r\n  which is in derogation of common law must be strictly construed and not extended \r\n  in application beyond clear legislative intent. Smalls v. Weed, 293 S.C. \r\n  364, 360 S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 1987); South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Wheaton, 323 S.C. 299, 474 S.E.2d 156 (Ct. App. 1996). Therefore, a statute \r\n  is not to be construed in derogation of common law rights if another interpretation \r\n  is reasonable. Hoogenboom v. City of Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  875 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\n\r\nThe intent of Â§ 10-5-260 is not to create any greater \r\n  duty of care than the duty of care established under the common law. The General \r\n  Assembly did not intend to abrogate the common law in favor of a heightened \r\n  standard of care owed only to disabled persons. We reject the position taken \r\n  by Olson that the statute articulates a higher standard of care than the common \r\n  law.\r\n\r\nB. Private Cause of Action\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to the question of the existence \r\n  of a duty as evidenced by the Act, Olson submits Â§ 10-5-260 creates a private \r\n  cause of action. Assuming, arguendo, Olson established a breach of the \r\n  Handicapped Accessibility Act, we find Â§ 10-5-260 does not create a private \r\n  cause of action.\r\n\r\nThe main factor in determining whether a statute \r\n  creates a private cause of action is legislative intent. Dorman v. Aiken \r\n  Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 398 S.E.2d 687 (1990). In Dorman, \r\n  the Supreme Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The legislative intent to grant or withhold a private \r\n    right of action for violation of a statute or the failure to perform a statutory \r\n    duty, is determined primarily from the language of the statute .... In this \r\n    respect, the general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish \r\n    a civil liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare \r\n    of the public as an entity is not subject to a construction establishing a \r\n    civil liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 67, 398 S.E.2d at 689 (quoting Whitworth \r\n  v. Fast Fare Markets of S.C., Inc., 289 S.C. 418, 420, 338 S.E.2d 155, 156 \r\n  (1985)).\r\n\r\nSection 10-5-260 does not evidence any legislative \r\n  intent that it created a private cause of action. This section states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  After January 1, 1975, no person may construct \r\n    or permit the construction of a governmental building or a public building \r\n    or any facility of either unless the building and facility is designed in \r\n    compliance with the standards and regulations adopted pursuant to this article.\r\n\r\n  After January 1, 1975, no person may renovate or \r\n    permit the renovation of a governmental building or a public building or any \r\n    facility of either unless the portions or areas being renovated are designed \r\n    in compliance with the standards and specifications established pursuant to \r\n    this article.\r\n\r\n  It is the responsibility of the owner or the occupant \r\n    of any property which contains structural or building elements or components \r\n    required to be in compliance with this article, to continuously maintain these \r\n    elements and components in a condition that is safe and usable by handicapped \r\n    persons at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Handicapped Accessibility Act does include \r\n  a private cause of action under another section. Section 10-5-290 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Any person who is injured, deprived of employment, \r\n    denied access to public buildings or facilities, or is otherwise deprived \r\n    of his rights as a citizen as declared in the statement of state policy set \r\n    forth in Section 10-5-210 may enforce his rights by injunction \r\n    and recover damages in a proper case in the court of common pleas when \r\n    his action is based on a violation of regulations promulgated by the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThis section is only available for a violation \r\n  of a regulation promulgated by the Board for Barrier-Free Design. \r\n  Faculty House attests that ANSI, OSHA, or other standards are not regulations \r\n  promulgated by the Board. Conversely, Olson asseverates the Board's adoption \r\n  of ANSI standards in its regulations was the functional equivalent of promulgating \r\n  a regulation. Were we to accept Olson's argument, it is unavailing as Olson \r\n  neither established a violation of ANSI standards under the Handicapped Accessibility \r\n  Act nor asserted a cause of action pursuant to Â§ 10-5-290. \r\n  (3) We note additionally that Olson did not move for injunctive relief \r\n  as provided by Â§ 10-5-290.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the language of Â§ 10-5-260 with \r\n  that of Â§ 10-5-290 makes it abundantly certain the legislature did not intend \r\n  for Â§ 10-5-260 to create a private cause of action in addition to the one articulated \r\n  in Â§ 10-5-290.\r\n\r\nThe Handicapped Accessibility Act places further \r\n  enforcement of its provisions solely with public officials rather than private \r\n  individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enforcement--The enforcement of these Regulations \r\n    including investigations shall be the responsibility of the Building Official \r\n    of the county or municipality. If the county or the municipality does not \r\n    have a Building Official, the Chief Fire Inspector shall then enforce these \r\n    Regulations. If a county or municipality does not have a Building Official \r\n    or a Chief Fire Inspector, then the Director of Building Codes and Regulatory \r\n    Services/Inspection Services of the State Budget and Control Board shall enforce \r\n    these Regulations in the county or municipality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-400.5(5).\r\n\r\nWe find the Circuit Court did not err in concluding \r\n  Olson did not demonstrate a private cause of action under Â§ 10-5-260.\r\n\r\nC. Proximate Cause\r\n\r\nOlson avers the Circuit Court erred in finding \r\n  she failed to present evidence the floor's alleged insufficient coefficient \r\n  of friction proximately caused her accident. In order to be actionable, negligence \r\n  must be the proximate cause of a plaintiff's injury. Hubbard v. Taylor, \r\n  339 S.C. 582, 529 S.E.2d 549 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nProximate cause requires proof of both causation \r\n  in fact and legal cause. Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  802 (1993). Causation in fact is proved by establishing the plaintiff's injury \r\n  would not have occurred \"but for\" the defendant's negligence. \r\n  Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nLegal cause, in contrast to the \"but for\" nature \r\n  of causation in fact, turns on the issue of foreseeability. Clark v. Cantrell, \r\n  332 S.C. 433, 504 S.E.2d 605 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Bishop \r\n  v. South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S. C. 79, 88-89, 502 S.E.2d \r\n  78, 83 (1998) (\"Causation in fact is proved by establishing the injury would \r\n  not have occurred 'but for' the defendant's negligence. Legal cause is proved \r\n  by establishing foreseeability.\") (citations omitted). \"The touchstone of proximate \r\n  cause in South Carolina is foreseeability. Foreseeability is determined by looking \r\n  to the natural and probable consequences of the act complained of.\" Vinson \r\n  v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 400, 477 S.E.2d 715, 721 (Ct. App. 1996). Foreseeability \r\n  is not determined from hindsight, but rather from the defendant's perspective \r\n  at the time of the complained of act. Id. at 324 S.C. at 401, 477 S.E.2d \r\n  at 721.\r\n\r\n\"A negligent act or omission is a proximate cause \r\n  of injury if, in a natural and continuous sequence of events, it produces the \r\n  injury, and without it, the injury would not have occurred.\" Id. In other \r\n  words, if the accident would have happened as a natural and probable consequence, \r\n  even in the absence of the alleged breach, then a plaintiff has failed to demonstrate \r\n  proximate cause.\r\n\r\nOlson alleges that \"but for\" the floor being in \r\n  violation of the Handicapped Accessibility Act, she would not have been injured. \r\n  Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Olson, the evidence does not \r\n  demonstrate that maintenance of the floor or the floor's coefficient of friction \r\n  was responsible for Olson's accident. Rather, the evidence indicated that \"but \r\n  for\" the unknown liquid on the floor, Olson would not have been injured. \r\n\r\nDurig maintained the floor was unreasonably dangerous \r\n  because it was wet, not because of its coefficient of friction. He avowed that \r\n  based on the test results, the floor would not have been unreasonably \r\n  dangerous had it been dry.\r\n\r\nOlson similarly failed to present evidence her \r\n  fall was foreseeable as the natural and probable consequence of the floor's \r\n  coefficient of friction. The dry floor had a coefficient of friction of .61. \r\n  The floor, when dry, met all of the proposed applicable standards regarding \r\n  nonslip surfaces and coefficients of friction. While the question of proximate \r\n  cause is ordinarily an issue for the jury, Olson failed to present any evidence \r\n  the floor itself, not the liquid, was the cause in fact and the legal cause \r\n  of her injury. See id. at 402, 477 S.E.2d at 721 (stating proximate \r\n  cause is generally a jury question). The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn \r\n  from the evidence is that the presence of the liquid proximately caused Olson's \r\n  injury. The Circuit Court therefore properly declined to submit the case to \r\n  a jury and granted summary judgment to Faculty House.\r\n\r\nII. Olson's Appeal of the \r\n  University's Dismissal\r\n\r\nOlson additionally appeals the grant of summary \r\n  judgment dismissing the University from the case. The trial court found Olson \r\n  did not initiate her action within the two years mandated by the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly promulgated the applicable \r\n  statute of limitations in Â§ 15-78-110:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Except as provided for in Section 15-3-40, any \r\n    action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless an \r\n    action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should \r\n    have been discovered; provided, that if the claimant first filed a \r\n    claim pursuant to this chapter then the action for damages based upon the \r\n    same occurrence is forever barred unless the action is commenced within three \r\n    years of the date the loss was or should have been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe Tort Claims Act defines \"loss\" in this case \r\n  as \"bodily injury.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(f) (Supp. 1999). Olson, therefore, \r\n  was required to bring this action within two years from her injury on November \r\n  6, 1995. Olson, however, did not move to add the University until January 1998.\r\n\r\nThe University asserts Olson's appeal is not timely \r\n  because Olson waited more than a year after the ruling before deciding to appeal \r\n  the order. We agree.\r\n\r\nOlson cites Link v. School District of Pickens \r\n  County, 302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990), for the proposition that it is \r\n  permissible to wait to appeal the grant of summary judgment in a multi-claim \r\n  action until final judgments have been rendered on all other claims. Link, \r\n  however, did not deal with multiple defendants and is not controlling under \r\n  the circumstances of this case.\r\n\r\nOlson further relies on an unpublished order of \r\n  this Court in an unrelated case. Unpublished orders by a single judge of this \r\n  court are not binding on this Court. Cf. Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; \r\n  Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 338 S.C. 343, 349, 526 S.E.2d 253, 256 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000) (\"[U]npublished opinions [of the appellate courts] have no precedential \r\n  value.\").\r\n\r\nRather, appealability turns on Â§ 14-3-330. See \r\n  James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 430 (2d ed. 1996) (\"The appealability \r\n  of trial court orders remains determined by the Supreme Court's jurisdictional \r\n  statute.\"). Section 14-3-330 declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction \r\n    for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n\r\n  (1) Any intermediate judgment, order \r\n    or decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court \r\n    of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or \r\n    removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments \r\n    in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final \r\n    judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final judgment review \r\n    any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before \r\n    appealed from;\r\n\r\n  (2) An order affecting a substantial \r\n    rights made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action \r\n    and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues \r\n    the action (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer \r\n    or any part thereof or any pleadings in any action.\r\n\r\n  (3) A final order affecting \r\n    a substantial right made in any special proceeding or upon a summary application \r\n    in any action after judgment; and\r\n\r\n  (4) An interlocutory order or decree \r\n    in a court of common pleas granting, continuing, modifying or refusing an \r\n    injunction or granting, continuing, modifying or refusing the appointment \r\n    of a receiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe court's grant of summary judgment to the University \r\n  based on the statute of limitations was a final order because it left nothing \r\n  further for determination. \"Any judgment or decree, leaving some further act \r\n  to be done by the court before the rights of the parties are determined, is \r\n  interlocutory; but if it so completely fixes the rights of the parties \r\n  that the court has nothing further to do in the action, then it is final.\" \r\n  Adickes v. Allison &amp; Bratton, 21 S.C. 245, 259 (1883) (emphasis added); \r\n  see also Mid-State Distribs., Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., \r\n  310 S.C. 330, 335, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993) (\"South Carolina case law has \r\n  established what constitutes an interlocutory appeal. If there is some further \r\n  act which must be done by the court prior to a determination of the rights of \r\n  the parties, then the order is interlocutory. If a judgment determines the applicable \r\n  law while leaving open questions of fact, it is not a final judgment.\") (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nThe order expressly ruled that all \r\n  of Olson's claims against the University were barred by the statute of limitations. \r\n  This ruling therefore adjudicated all of the claims as to the University. Faculty \r\n  House did not assert the statute of limitations as a defense. Olson's claims \r\n  against Faculty House were thus separate and discrete from her claim against \r\n  the University. The fact Olson had continuing claims against Faculty House was \r\n  irrelevant to the dismissal of the University. Nothing short of direct appeal \r\n  could resurrect the action against the University.\r\n\r\nIn today's world the proliferation of parties is \r\n  a common occurrence. Were we to adopt Olson's view, a dismissed party would \r\n  be \"on hold\" indefinitely.\r\n\r\n The timely service of an appeal is a jurisdictional \r\n  requirement that cannot be waived. Rule 203, SCACR. That rule enunciates, in \r\n  pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (a) Notice. A party intending to appeal \r\n    must serve and file a notice of appeal and otherwise comply with these Rules.\r\n\r\n  (b) Time for Service\r\n    (1) Appeals from the Court of Common Pleas. A notice of appeal shall \r\n    be served on all respondents within thirty (30) days after receipt of written \r\n    notice of entry of the order or judgment â€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlson failed to timely serve her appeal of the \r\n  trial court's dismissal of the University. Therefore, this Court may not review \r\n  the grant of summary judgment.\r\n\r\nAssuming, arguendo, she could appeal the \r\n  dismissal, Olson claims the Handicapped Accessibility Act created an independent \r\n  cause of action not subject to the Tort Claims Act's statute of limitations. \r\n  This argument is without merit. We have already concluded Â§ 10-5-260 does not \r\n  establish a private cause of action in addition to that found in Â§ 10-5-290.\r\n\r\nEven if Olson had been permitted to proceed against \r\n  the University under the Handicapped Accessibility Act, the Tort Claims Act's \r\n  statute of limitations would bar the action.\r\n\r\nThe Tort Claims Act is the exclusive \r\n  remedy when a party is injured by a governmental entity. Section 15-78-200 announces:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any provision of law, this \r\n    chapter, the \"South Carolina Tort Claims Act\" is the exclusive and sole remedy \r\n    for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity while acting \r\n    within the scope of the employee's official duty. The provisions of \r\n    this chapter establish limitations on and exemptions to the liability of the \r\n    governmental entity and must be liberally construed in favor of limiting the \r\n    liability of the governmental entity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe University is clearly a governmental entity \r\n  under the provisions of the Tort Claims Act. Section 15-78-30(d) defines \"governmental \r\n  entity\" as the State or its political subdivisions. \r\n  Concomitantly, Â§ 15-78-30(e) declares: \r\n\r\n\r\n  \"State\" means the State of South Carolina and \r\n    any of its offices, agencies, authorities, departments, commissions, boards, \r\n    divisions, instrumentalities, including the South Carolina Protection and \r\n    Advocacy System for the Handicapped, Inc., and institutions, including state-supported \r\n    governmental health care facilities, schools, colleges, universities, \r\n    and technical colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe Tort Claims Act thus governs this action regardless \r\n  of the Handicapped Accessibility Act. At most, the Handicapped Accessibility \r\n  Act provides evidence of a duty owed to Olson by the University to maintain \r\n  its buildings in a manner in which they are accessible to the handicapped -- \r\n  it does not supplant or override the Tort Claims Act. \r\n\r\nWe find the Circuit Court properly declined to \r\n  permit Olson to pursue a cause of action based on the Handicapped Accessibility \r\n  Act. The two-year statute of limitations found in the Tort Claims Act is applicable \r\n  to all causes of action against the University and other governmental entities \r\n  whether the alleged duty violated arises under the Handicapped Accessibility \r\n  Act, another statute, or common law.\r\n\r\nIII. Faculty House's Appeal\r\n\r\nFaculty House appeals the Circuit Court's denial \r\n  of its motion for summary judgment on the ground Olson failed to demonstrate \r\n  Faculty House was negligent by either placing the liquid on the floor or by \r\n  failing to remove it after having actual or constructive notice of the liquid's \r\n  presence.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that generally, the denial of a motion \r\n  for summary judgment is not immediately appealable. Ballenger v. Bowen, \r\n  313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1991). Our appellate courts, however, have recognized \r\n  an exception to this rule. Specifically, the courts have made a practice of \r\n  accepting appeals of denials of interlocutory orders not ordinarily immediately \r\n  appealable when these appeals are companion to issues that are reviewable.\r\n\r\nOur examination of the case law regarding this \r\n  exception begins with the Supreme Court's agreement to consider an appeal of \r\n  whether a trial court erred in failing to require a party make its complaint \r\n  more definite in Briggs v. Richardson, 273 S.C. 376, 256 S.E.2d 544 (1979). \r\n  Additionally appealed to the Court for its review was an issue of whether the \r\n  trial court erred in overruling the appellant's demurrer. Presented with the \r\n  question of whether to address the denial of the motion for a more definite \r\n  complaint, the Briggs Court pronounced: \"While not normally appealable, \r\n  [the] issue [concerning the motion for a more definite complaint] is before \r\n  the Court due to the appealability of the first issue [regarding the demurrer].\" \r\n  Id. at 379 n.1, 256 S.E.2d at 546 n.1.\r\n\r\nThis Court has taken a concordant view concerning \r\n  the propriety of reviewing interlocutory orders not ordinarily immediately appealable.\r\n\r\nIn Garrett v. Snedigar, 293 S.C. 176, 359 \r\n  S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 1987), partners in a real estate venture brought an action \r\n  for fraud, breach of contract, and violations of the South Carolina Uniform \r\n  Securities Act against the organizer, a construction company, and an investment \r\n  advisor who was retained to market the partnership. The investment advisor was \r\n  also sued for negligence. The Circuit Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for \r\n  summary judgment, which concerned the issue of whether their interests in the \r\n  partnership were securities. The trial court additionally granted the plaintiffs' \r\n  motion to amend their cause of action for negligence and denied the investment \r\n  advisor's summary judgment motion pertaining to this claim. On appeal, the investment \r\n  advisor argued, inter alia, the trial court erred in acting on the plaintiffs' \r\n  motion to amend without holding a hearing separate from his motion for summary \r\n  judgment. In response, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  An interlocutory appeal of this issue â€¦ is not \r\n    normally allowed. See Davis-McGee Mule Co. v. Marett, 129 S.C. \r\n    36, 37, 123 S.E. 323, 323 (1924) (\"No appeal can be made except from a final \r\n    judgment.\"). An order denying summary judgment cannot be appealed, even after \r\n    trial. Holloman v. McAllister, 289 S.C. 183, 345 S.E.2d 728 (1986). \r\n    However, these issues are properly before us because the issue of whether \r\n    the Circuit Court erred in granting the motion of the plaintiffs for partial \r\n    summary judgment is appealable. See Briggs v. Richardson, 273 S.C. 376, 379, \r\n    256 S.E.2d 544, 546 (1979) (\"While not normally appealable, this issue is \r\n    before the Court due to the appealability of the first issue.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 183 n.2, 359 S.E.2d at 287 n.2 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nNumerous reviews of denials of summary judgment \r\n  motions have occurred since Garrett. See Anthony v. Padmar, \r\n  Inc., 307 S.C. 503, 415 S.E.2d 828 (Ct. App. 1992), cited in \r\n  4 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review Â§ 170 (1995) (in a case where opposing \r\n  motions for summary judgment resulted in the trial court granting one and denying \r\n  the other, the Court of Appeals held the party whose motion was denied may have \r\n  the denial reviewed on the appeal because the question of whether the trial \r\n  court erred in granting the other motion was appealable); Pruitt v. Bowers, \r\n  330 S.C. 483, 488, 499 S.E.2d 250, 253 (Ct. App. 1999), cert. denied \r\n  (\"[Respondent/Appellant] argues the trial court erred in granting [Appellant/Respondent's] \r\n  motion to amend her complaint. [Appellant/Respondent] responds that the order \r\n  granting the motion is interlocutory and thus not appealable. We agree that \r\n  under the precedent of Briggs v. Richardson â€¦ and Garrett v. Snedigar \r\n  â€¦ [Respondent/Appellant's] appeal of the amendment order is interlocutory and \r\n  generally not appealable, but may be considered by the court because it accompanies \r\n  the appeal of the grant of [Respondent/Appellant's] motion for summary judgment.\"); \r\n  Tanner v. Florence City-County Bldg. Comm'n, 333 S.C. 549, 553, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  369, 371 (Ct. App. 1999) (this Court ruled: \"[A]n order that is not directly \r\n  appealable will be considered if there is an appealable issue before this court.\").\r\n\r\nIn Davis v. Lunceford, 287 S.C. 242, 335 \r\n  S.E.2d 798 (1985), the Supreme Court held reviewing the denial of summary judgment \r\n  was proper to resolve protracted litigation: \"Because of the need for final \r\n  resolution in this [13-year-old medical malpractice] case, we have allowed this \r\n  direct appeal from the lower court's order denying appellant's motion for summary \r\n  judgment.\"). Id. at 243, 335 S.E.2d at 799. The issue of whether the \r\n  denial was proper was the only one on appeal.\r\n\r\n This Court has reviewed the denial of Faculty \r\n  House's motion for summary judgment as it pertained to Olson's common law negligence \r\n  claim in accordance with the preceding authorities. We find it important to \r\n  note that regardless of whether a denial of a motion for summary judgment is \r\n  reviewable when in tandem with appealable issues, the parties have briefed, \r\n  with specificity, the merits of the denial of Faculty House's \r\n  motion for summary judgment. Numerous cases have been cited and argued in regard \r\n  to a final disposition of this issue. In essence, the parties have consented \r\n  to have the matter adjudicated by this tribunal. It would therefore be strikingly \r\n  strange to bottom and premise our opinion on a technicality not raised by any \r\n  party.\r\n\r\nThe continued viability of Garrett is debatable \r\n  given the recent decisions of Silverman v. Campbell, 326 S.C. 208, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 1 (1997) and Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 \r\n  (1994).\r\n\r\nIn Ballenger, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This Court has repeatedly held that the denial \r\n    of summary judgment is not directly appealable â€¦. Further, this Court has \r\n    held that the denial of summary judgment is not reviewable even in an appeal \r\n    from final judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 476-77, 443 S.E.2d at 380.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Ballenger Court noted that \r\n  it is \"unnecessary [for the trial judge] to make findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law in denying motions for summary judgment.\" Id. at 478 n.1, 443 S.E.2d \r\n  at 380 n.1 (citing Rule 52, SCRCP). Thus, there would be no basis on which an \r\n  appellate court could make its review.\r\n\r\nIn Silverman, our Supreme Court refused \r\n  to consider the appellants' claim that the trial court had erred in denying \r\n  its motion for summary judgment, although it did consider another issue raised \r\n  by appellants because it was immediately appealable. Thus, the presence of an \r\n  immediately appealable issue in the order did not make the denial of summary \r\n  judgment reviewable in that instance. Id. at 211, 486 S.E.2d at 3; cf. \r\n  Hollman v. McAllister, 289 S.C. 183, 345 S.E.2d 728 (1986) (declining \r\n  to address denial of summary judgment after trial while addressing other appealable \r\n  issues); Davis v. Tripp, 338 S.C. 226, 525 S.E.2d 528 (Ct. App. 1999) \r\n  (stating denial of summary judgment was not reviewable either before or after \r\n  final judgment and expressly declining to address denial of summary judgment).\r\n\r\nSilverman may represent an attempt to curtail \r\n  Garrett-style exceptions, thereby requiring a closer inquiry into their \r\n  continued viability.\r\n\r\nBecause of the dissonance in the precedent in regard \r\n  to the appealability of the denial of a motion for summary judgment, we decline \r\n  to address the issue on the merits.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold Olson did not establish any violation of ANSI specifications, as referenced \r\nin the South Carolina Handicapped Accessibility Act, regarding the \"slip-resistance\" \r\nof Faculty House's flooring. We conclude the General Assembly did not intend to \r\ncreate a heightened standard of care, which businesses would owe solely to their \r\ndisabled patrons, with the passage of the Handicapped Accessibility Act. We rule \r\nÂ§ 10-5-260 does not create a private cause of action. We find Olson \r\ndid not satisfy the element of proximate cause by failing to show \"but for\" the \r\nlack of \"slip-resistance\" on Faculty House's flooring, she would not have incurred \r\nher injuries. \r\nThe Tort Claims Act governs tort actions brought \r\n  against the state or its political subdivisions. It is the exclusive remedy \r\n  for persons injured by a governmental entity. The University is an agency of \r\n  South Carolina state government. Therefore, the provisions of the Tort Claims \r\n  Act apply in the instant case. Pursuant to the Tort Claims Act, claimants have \r\n  two years from the date of injury to institute litigation against a tortfeasor \r\n  governmental entity. Olson did not add the University to the action until more \r\n  than two years had elapsed after her fall at the Faculty House. This Court affirms \r\n  the Circuit Court's ruling that Olson was time-barred in her claim against the \r\n  University.\r\n\r\nFinally, we decline to address the Circuit Court's \r\n  denial of Faculty House's motion for summary judgment regarding Olson's common \r\n  law negligence claim. \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Circuit Court's \r\n  judgments are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS ADDRESSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON AND SHULER, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  Since the events giving \r\n  rise to these actions, the General Assembly substantially revised the Handicapped \r\n  Accessibility Act, including Â§ 10-5-260. See Act No. 303, 2000 S.C. Acts \r\n  2097. \r\n2.  We address the other issues \r\n  raised in Olson's brief within the discussions of the University's and Faculty \r\n  House's appeals. \r\n3.  Olson's issue on appeal \r\n  concerning this matter is framed solely as:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court err in holding that there is no private \r\n    right of action for the recovery of money damages for a breach of the duty \r\n    of care set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-260, as amended, such a recovery \r\n    being provided for only where there is a violation of regulations promulgated \r\n    by the South Carolina Board for Barrier Free Design as provided in S.C.

Parker appeal from their grand larceny convictions on the ground that the trial court lacked\r\nthe requisite subject matter jurisdiction. (1)  We agree and vacate the convictions. \r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Marlboro County grand jury indicted Kirby and Parker on a single count of armed robbery for perpetrating a sham robbery of Boulevard Express, a local\r\nconvenience store, on November 2, 1997.  The crime netted the pair $1,192.00 in currency and two pistols.  Kirby was also indicted for contributing to the\r\ndelinquency of a minor because he arranged to have Sedrick Alford, a juvenile acquaintance, participate in the crime.   \r\n\r\nOn the day in question, Kirby approached Alford and asked if he would like to make some money.  Alford agreed and the pair traveled to Boulevard Express at\r\napproximately 5:00 p.m.  Kirby left Alford at a nearby fast-food restaurant while he entered the convenience store.  Therein, Kirby spoke with Parker as she\r\nworked.  Kirby later revealed to Alford the plan to stage an armed robbery of the store later that evening while Parker was still working.  The plan called for\r\nAlford to enter the store alone wearing a mask and carrying a pistol, both provided by Kirby, and demand money and a pistol from Parker, who would fully\r\ncooperate.  \r\n\r\nAlford carried out the plan at approximately 7:00 p.m.  Parker aided Alford during the sham robbery by retrieving money from the store's safe and voluntarily\r\nshowing him where the store's firearms were secreted behind the sales counter.  Alford received $60 and a new pair of tennis shoes for his participation in the\r\ncrime. \r\n\r\nWhile investigating the apparent armed robbery, police received a tip which implicated Alford.   On November 3, 1997, Alford was questioned by police and\r\nfreely confessed his involvement in the sham robbery.   He also revealed Kirby and Parker's involvement.\r\n\r\nBased on Alford's confession, the police interviewed Parker.   Although she admitted to having recognized Alford during the robbery, she denied any\r\nparticipation in it and claimed to have concealed Alford's identity from police in order to protect him.  She did not testify at trial.  Kirby testified and denied any\r\ninvolvement in the crime.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the state's case, the trial court directed a verdict for the defendants stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n[this] is clearly a grand larceny case.  I grant your motion as to armed robbery.  I grant it as to robbery.  But I will charge a less[e]r included offense of larceny\r\nwhich is the taking of the property of another with the intent of depriving the owner permanently thereof in the amount greater than $1,000.  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one objected to the ruling.  The jury found the pair guilty of grand larceny.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nParker and Kirby argue the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict them of grand larceny because it is not a lesser-included offense of the\r\ncharged offense of armed robbery.  We agree.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIssues involving subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime, including for the first time on appeal.  Weinhauer v. State, 334 S.C. 327, 513 S.E.2d 840\r\n(1999).  Therefore, we consider the trial court's jurisdiction to try Parker and Kirby for grand larceny despite the lack of a ruling by the trial court on the issue.\r\n\r\nA trial court acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear a criminal case by way of a legally sufficient indictment or a valid waiver thereof.  State v. Johnston,\r\n333 S.C. 459, 510 S.E.2d 423 (1999).  The scope of the jurisdiction conferred by an indictment is limited to the charged offense and any lesser-included\r\noffenses.   State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 (1993); State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 518 S.E.2d 278 (Ct. App. 1999).  Distinct offenses may be charged\r\nin separate counts of the same indictment.  State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1996)(citing State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 89 S.E.2d 701\r\n(1955)).  However, two separate offenses cannot, ordinarily, be charged in a single-count indictment unless one is a lesser-included offense of the other.  State\r\nv. Fennell, 263 S.C. 216, 209 S.E.2d 433 (1974).\r\n\r\nAn indictment sufficiently charges a particular offense when \"it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and informs the\r\ndefendant of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend.\"  Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 56, 533 S.E.2d 324, 325 (2000) (citing Granger v. State, 333 S.C.\r\n2, 507 S.E.2d 322 (1998)). (2)  An indictment  must: (1) enumerate all the elements of the charged offense, regardless of whether it is a statutory or common law\r\noffense, and (2) recite the factual circumstances under which the offense occurred. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (1985); State v. Evans, 322 S.C. 78, 470\r\nS.E.2d 97 (1996).  Our supreme court has instructed us to apply \"the indictment sufficiency test[] . . . with a practical eye\" to determine if the defendant was\r\nprejudiced by the content of the indictment.  State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 125, 283 S.E.2d 582, 587 (1981), overruled on other grounds, State v. Torrence, 305\r\nS.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).  \r\n\r\nThe indictment sub judice appears to be sufficient as the textual portion of the indictment sets forth the elements of both armed robbery and grand larceny (3)\r\nwhile also providing an adequate factual basis for the offenses. (4)  However, separate offenses cannot be charged in a single-count indictment unless one is a\r\nlesser-included offense of the other.  Fennell, 263 S.C. at 219, 209 S.E.2d at 434.  Scrutinizing the indictment with a practical eye, we conclude Kirby and\r\nParker were prejudiced because they faced the charge of armed robbery at trial, but were forced at the end of the State's case to face the separate offense of\r\ngrand larceny.  \r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBecause grand larceny was neither sufficiently charged by the single-count indictment nor waived by the defendants, the only possible source of jurisdiction\r\nupon which the trial court could have continued to try Parker and Kirby is grand larceny's status as a lesser-included offense of armed robbery.  \"The test for\r\ndetermining if a crime is a lesser included offense is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the elements of the lesser offense.\"  State v. McFadden,\r\nOp. No. 25202 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 4, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 39 at 3); see also Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998).  If,\r\nunder any circumstances, a person can commit the greater offense without being guilty of the purported lesser offense, then the latter is not a lesser-included\r\noffense.  Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Lawson, our supreme court, citing State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 260 S.E.2d 719 (1979), vacated Lawson's grand larceny sentence, recognizing\r\nLawson's larceny as a lesser-included offense of robbery. (5) Lawson, 279 S.C. 266, 305 S.E.2d 249 (1983).  See also State v. Pressley, 288 S.C. 128, 341 S.E.2d\r\n626 (1986)(declining to overrule or modify Lawson). The Court in Brown recognized larceny as an element of common law robbery.  This suggests that the\r\nCourt in Lawson compared the common law elements of robbery and grand larceny to determine the latter's status as a lesser-included offense.  However,\r\nstatutory enactments involving larceny after the publication of Lawson have affected the status of grand larceny as a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. \r\n\r\n\"At common law every simple larceny, whatever the value of the property stolen, was a felony . . . .\"  State v. Gray, 14 Rich. 174, 175 (1867).   However,\r\ncommon law larceny recognized two separate punishments based on the value of the goods stolen.   Id.   \"If the value of the property was not above twelve\r\npence, the theft constituted the offence known as petit larceny\" and the convicted offender would be sentenced to either a term of imprisonment or a whipping. \r\nId.  A theft greater than twelve pence was considered grand larceny \"and was punished with death, though with benefit of clergy.\"  Id.  Thus, the common law\r\nregarded the petit/grand larceny distinction as merely a sentencing mechanism rather than an element of the offense.  See 36 C.J. Larceny Â§224 (1924)\r\n(recognizing petit and grand larceny as merely two separate \"degrees\" of larceny, not elements of the offense).\r\n\r\nCommon law petit larceny became a statutory offense after the enactment of an 1866 statute which reclassified the offense as a misdemeanor and established a\r\ntwenty dollar threshold.   Id.   It has remained a statutory offense since 1866 and has changed little to this day. (6)  The enactment of the petit larceny statute did\r\nnot impliedly convert grand larceny into a similar statutory crime.  See  State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 66, 447 S.E.2d 177, 182 (1993) (\"Common law offenses\r\nare not abrogated simply because there is a statutory offense proscribing similar conduct.  Rather, it is presumed that no change in common law is intended\r\nunless the Legislature explicitly indicates such an intention by language in the statute.\")(citations omitted).\r\n\r\nGrand larceny remained a common law offense until 1993 when the legislature amended the petit larceny statute to add a statutory definition of grand larceny. (7)&nbsp;\r\n\"Larceny of goods . . . valued in excess of one thousand dollars is grand larceny\" and  a felony.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (B) (Supp. 2000); see also Coakley\r\nv. Tidewater Constr. Corp., 194 S.C. 284, 9 S.E.2d 724 (1940) (requiring a clear legislative intent to change the common law).  As our Legislature has created\r\nthe statutory offense of grand larceny, we must now look to the elements contained in the statute, rather than the common law offense to determine if grand\r\nlarceny is a lesser-included offense of armed robbery.   We conclude that because grand larceny has the element of \"in excess of one thousand dollars\" it is not a\r\nlesser-included offense of armed robbery which has no monetary element. (8)  \r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the convictions are \r\n\r\nVACATED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J., concurs; GOOLSBY, J., dissents.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):\r\n\r\nI respectfully dissent.  \r\n\r\nWere this court free to pass upon the issue presented in this case, I would be inclined to agree with the majority that grand larceny is not a lesser-included\r\noffense of armed robbery.  Our supreme court, however, has already held that grand larceny is a lesser-included offense of armed robbery, (9) and its ruling is\r\nbinding upon this court. (10)\r\n\r\nTo reach the issue, the majority finds that the supreme court's prior opinions interpret the common law crime of grand larceny and finds that this court is free to\r\ninterpret the 1993 \"codification\" of grand larceny.  I disagree, as I do not believe that South Carolina Code section 16-13-30 abrogates the common law crime\r\nof larceny/grand larceny. (11)  Rather, I read section 16-13-30 as primarily a sentencing statute.  As noted by Professor McAninch, the larceny statute \"does very\r\nlittle to define the offense; the statute is primarily concerned with providing penalties for the different categories of the offense, depending upon the value of the\r\nproperty taken.\" (12)\r\n\r\nBecause the larceny statute does not replace this state's continued use of the common law, we are bound by the supreme court's precedent until it is otherwise\r\noverruled.  \r\n\r\nAs to the fact that the indictment in this case may be duplicitous, I simply note no objection was made either prior to trial or when the trial court instructed the\r\ndefendant that it was charging grand larceny. (13)\r\n\r\nI would affirm the conviction.\r\n\r\n1. Kirby was also found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, but that conviction is not a part of this appeal.\r\n2.

State, 329 S.C. 355, 362-63, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998) (\"An indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and\r\nparticularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an\r\nacquittal or conviction thereon.\"); Browning v.

An electric company meter reader was injured while on the property of a customer.  The trial court directed\r\na verdict in favor of the customer concluding the meter reader was a licensee on the property as opposed to an invitee.  The meter reader appeals.  We reverse\r\nand remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAt the time of her accident, Angela Sims was employed by the South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (\"SCE&amp;G\") as a meter reader.  On April 18, 1995,\r\nbecause of a backlog, Sims was reading meters on a route she had ridden on as a passenger but was otherwise unfamiliar with the route.  One of the houses on\r\nthis route was owned by Derrick Giles.  His meter was located on the back of his residence and only accessible through a wrought iron gate leading into his\r\nbackyard.  When Sims attempted to open the gate, it somehow came off its hinges and crashed on top of her.\r\n\r\nIn approximately July of 1994, Giles began wedging a stick, which he painted the same color orange as the fence, behind his cast iron gate to hold it shut.  Due\r\nto settling, the gate no longer functioned the same as when it was originally installed.  The stick propped behind the gate stopped it from opening and blowing\r\nin the wind.\r\n\r\nTo open the gate, a person must reach through the bars and knock the stick over.  Without the stick in place, the gate swings freely with no problem and with\r\nlittle effort.  It swings inward on pin-type hinges and typically lifts up slightly as it opens.  Randall Langston, one of the regular meter readers on this route,\r\ntestified he had no trouble with the gate after he started using the proper technique for opening it.  However, if too much force is applied to the gate, as\r\nhappened on at least one occasion with Langston, then it would fall off its hinges.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering the gate off its hinges at some point prior to Sims' accident, Giles called SCE&amp;G and gave instructions on how to open the gate.  He\r\nexplained the technique of reaching through the gate and knocking the stick aside.  Information to this effect was entered on a hand-held computer carried by\r\nSCE&amp;G meter readers called a \"data cap.\"  The data cap contains all necessary information while in the field, including addresses, meter locations at those\r\naddresses, and other special instructions, which range from telephone numbers of customers to reports of bad dogs or locked gates.  While on the route each\r\nmonth, the data cap beeps until the meter reader reads and acknowledges any special instructions or warnings at a particular address by pressing a button.\r\n\r\nSims declared the data cap advised to \"kick on board, gate will fall open.\"  She professed she only saw a two-by-four under the bottom of the gate.  She did not\r\nsee the stick holding the gate shut.  Sims propped the data cap between her legs and kicked the two-by-four.  After her second kick, the board shifted.  Sims\r\ncaught her boot under the gate.  She fell to the ground and the gate crashed on top of her.\r\n\r\nSims and her husband filed actions for negligence, loss of consortium, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.  At the conclusion of the Sims' case, Giles\r\nmoved for a directed verdict on the issue of liability.  After hearing arguments on the motion, the trial judge found Sims, acting in her capacity as a meter\r\nreader, was a licensee.  Based on this classification, the trial judge ruled that, as a matter of law, there was no evidence of negligence on the part of Giles.  The\r\ntrial judge directed a verdict in favor of Giles on all causes of action.  The Simses appeal the directed verdict on their causes of action.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing, 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999); Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 504 S.E.2d 347 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\nSee also Weir v. Citicorp Nat'l Servs., Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 435 S.E.2d 864 (1993)(illustrating an appellate court must apply the same standard when reviewing\r\nthe trial judge's decision on such motions).  When the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.  Swinton\r\nCreek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469, 514 S.E.2d 126 (1999); Arthurs v. Aiken County, 338 S.C. 253, 525 S.E.2d 542 (Ct. App. 1999).  If more\r\nthan one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the jury.  Mullinax v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 333 S.C. 89,\r\n508 S.E.2d 848 (1998); Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 489 S.E.2d 223 (Ct. App. 1997).  See also Horry County v.\r\nLaychur, 315 S.C. 364, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993)(directed verdict should not be granted unless only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence).\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or non-existence of evidence.  Long v. Norris\r\n&amp; Assocs., Ltd., Op. No. 3243 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 25, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 36 at 28); Jones v. General Elec. Co., 331 S.C. 351, 503\r\nS.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1998).  The trial court can only be reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.  Swinton Creek Nursery,\r\n334 S.C. at 477, 514 S.E.2d at 130; Arthurs, 338 S.C. at 261, 525 S.E.2d at 546.  When reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, the appellate court should not\r\nignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.  Collins, 332 S.C. at 296, 504 S.E.2d at 350.  Rather, it must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party\r\nwould be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in the opposing party's favor.  Jones, 331 S.C. at 356, 503 S.E.2d at 176.  See also First\r\nState Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 385 S.E.2d 821 (1989)(in reviewing granting of directed verdict, court should determine elements of action alleged\r\nand whether any evidence existed on each element).\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nWas Sims, in her capacity as a meter reader for SCE&amp;G, a licensee or an invitee while on premises owned by Giles, a customer of SCE&amp;G?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSims argues she, while properly on Giles' property in her capacity as a meter reader for SCE&amp;G, was an invitee.  She contends the trial court committed\r\nreversible error in classifying her status as a licensee.  We agree.\r\n\r\nA.  Premises Liability\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes four general classifications of persons who come on premises: adult trespassers, invitees, licensees, and children.  Different standards\r\nof care apply depending on whether the visitor is considered an \"invitee,\" i.e., an invited (express or implied) business guest; a \"licensee,\" i.e., a person not\r\ninvited, but whose presence is suffered; a \"trespasser,\" i.e., a person whose presence is neither invited nor suffered; or a child.  See Joseph F. Singleton,\r\nLiability of Owner or Possessor of Land, 21 S.C. L. Rev. 291 (1969).  See also Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 444, 531 S.E.2d 535, 538\r\n(Ct. App. 2000)(\"The level of care owed is dependent upon the class of the person present.\").\r\n\r\nIn premises liability cases, the invitee is offered the utmost duty of care by the landowner and a trespasser is generally offered the least.  Since meter readers\r\nenter premises with some form of acquiescence or permission arising through the landowner's contract with SCE&amp;G, they are not trespassers.  See Smiley v.\r\nSouthern R.R., 184 S.C. 130, 191 S.E. 895 (1937)(if owner or possessor consents or acquiesces in constant trespasses, an implicit invitation requiring such care\r\nas is individually owed to a licensee may be found); Snow v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 544, 552, 409 S.E.2d 797, 802 (Ct. App. 1991)(\"The unwarrantable\r\nentry on land in the peaceable possession of another is a trespass . . . . The entry itself is the wrong.  Thus, for example, if one without license from the person in\r\npossession of land walks upon it, . . . he commits a trespass by the very act of breaking the enclosure.\")(citation omitted).  In fact, the contention that a meter\r\nreader is not specifically invited onto the premises and is thus a trespasser has been rejected.  See 62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises Liability Â§ 453 (1990).  Sims is not a\r\nchild; therefore, the only issue presented, which is novel in South Carolina, is whether Sims, in her capacity as a SCE&amp;G meter reader, should be considered an\r\ninvitee or a licensee.\r\n\r\nB.  Invitees\r\n\r\n\"An invitee is a person who enters onto the property of another at the express or implied invitation of the property owner.\"  Goode v. St. Stephens United\r\nMethodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 441, 494 S.E.2d 827, 831 (Ct. App. 1997).  \"Invitees are limited to those persons who enter or remain on land upon an\r\ninvitation which carries with it an implied representation, assurance, or understanding that reasonable care has been used to prepare the premises, and make\r\nthem safe for their reception.\"  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 332 cmt. a (1965).  The visitor is considered an invitee especially when he is upon a matter of\r\nmutual interest or advantage to the property owner.  Parker v. Stevenson Oil Co., 245 S.C. 275, 140 S.E.2d 177 (1965); Landry v. Hilton Head Plantation Prop.\r\nOwners Ass'n, Inc., 317 S.C. 200, 452 S.E.2d 619 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\n\"Phrased somewhat differently, it may be said that a person is an invitee on the land of another if he enters by express or implied invitation, his entry is\r\nconnected with the owner's business or with an activity the owner conducts or permits to be conducted on his land, and there is a mutuality of benefit or a\r\nbenefit to the owner.\"  62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises Liability Â§ 87 (1990).  See also Larimore, 340 S.C. at 444, 531 S.E.2d at 538 (\"Because Larimore, [who was\r\nhired by the property owner to add vinyl siding to his home,] was a business visitor invited to enter or remain on the property for a purpose directly or indirectly\r\nconnected with [the property owner], Larimore was an invitee.\").\r\n\r\n\"Invitees include patrons of stores, patients in a physician's office, persons visiting a filling station to use the restroom or vending machine or to ask directions,\r\nand workmen invited to work on the premises.\"  F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 112-13 (2d ed. 1997)(footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nThe law recognizes two types of invitees: the public invitee and the business visitor.  \"A public invitee is one who is invited to enter or remain on the land as a\r\nmember of the public for a purpose for which the land is held open to the public.\"  Goode, 329 S.C. at 441, 494 S.E.2d at 831; Restatement (Second) of  Torts Â§\r\n332(2) (1965).  See also Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997)(discussing the duty owed a public\r\ninvitee who was injured when she fell off a public dock; landowner may be liable for an injury arising from an \"open and obvious\" danger if the landowner\r\nshould have anticipated the harm that occurred).\r\n\r\nA business visitor, on the other hand, is an invitee whose purpose for being on the property is directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the\r\nowner.  Goode, 329 S.C. at 441, 494 S.E.2d at 831.  See also Parker, 245 S.C. at 280, 140 S.E.2d at 179 (the term \"invitee\" in premises liability cases usually\r\nmeans the same thing as a business visitor and refers to one who enters upon the premises of another at the express or implied invitation of the occupant,\r\nespecially when he is there about a matter of mutual interest or advantage); Hoover v. Broome, 324 S.C. 531, 535, 479 S.E.2d 62, 65 (Ct. App. 1996)(\"Business\r\nvisitors are considered invitees as long as their purpose for entering the property is either directly or indirectly connected with the purpose for which the\r\nproperty owner uses the land.\"); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 332(3) (1965)(\"A business visitor is a person who is invited to enter or remain on land for a\r\npurpose directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the possessor of the land.\").  However, \"[t]he class of persons qualifying as business\r\nvisitors is not limited to those coming upon the land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with the business conducted thereon by the possessor, but\r\nincludes as well those coming upon the land for a purpose connected with their own business, which itself is directly or indirectly connected with a purpose for\r\nwhich the possessor uses the land.\"  62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises Liability Â§ 88 (1990)(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe business visitor is generally divided into two classes.  The first class of business visitor \"includes persons who are invited to come upon the land for a\r\npurpose connected with the business for which the land is held open to the public, as where a person enters a shop to make a purchase, or to look at goods on\r\ndisplay.\"  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 332 cmt. e (1965).  \"The second class includes those who come upon land not open to the public, for a purpose\r\nconnected with business which the possessor conducts upon the land, or for a purpose connected with their own business which is connected with any purpose,\r\nbusiness or otherwise, for which the possessor uses the land.\"  Id.  \"Thus a truck driver from a provision store who enters to deliver goods to a private residence\r\nis a business visitor; and so is a workman who comes to make alterations or repairs on land used for residence purposes.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nThe owner of property owes to an invitee or business visitor the duty of exercising reasonable or ordinary care for his safety, and is liable for injuries resulting\r\nfrom the breach of such duty.  Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438,  531 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 2000).  The landowner has a duty to warn an\r\ninvitee only of latent or hidden dangers of which the landowner has knowledge or should have knowledge.  Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C.\r\n123, 406 S.E.2d 361 (1991).  The degree of care required is commensurate with the particular circumstances involved, including the age and capacity of the\r\ninvitee.  Henderson v. St. Francis Cmty. Hosp., 303 S.C. 177, 399 S.E.2d 767 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn addressing this issue, our Supreme Court specifically adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 343A (1965) in Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp.,\r\n305 S.C. at 126, 406 S.E.2d at 362. (1)  Section 343A provides:\r\n\r\nÂ§ 343 A. Known or Obvious Dangers\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) A possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious\r\nto them, unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.\r\n\r\n(2) In determining whether the possessor should anticipate harm from a known or obvious danger, the fact that the invitee is entitled to make use of public land,\r\nor of the facilities of a public utility, is a factor of importance indicating that the harm should be anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis duty is an active or affirmative duty.  Hughes v. Children's Clinic, P.A., 269 S.C. 389, 237 S.E.2d 753 (1977); Garvin v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 337 S.C. 436, 523\r\nS.E.2d 481 (Ct. App. 1999), cert. granted, March 21, 2000.  It includes refraining from any act which may make the invitee's use of the premises dangerous or\r\nresult in injury to him.  Hughes, 269 S.C. at 397, 237 S.E.2d at 756; Garvin, 337 S.C. at 444, 523 S.E.2d at 485.  It is not necessary that the precise manner in\r\nwhich the injuries were sustained be foreseeable.  Hughes, 269 S.C. at 397, 237 S.E.2d at 757; Orr v. First Nat'l Stores, Inc., 280 A.2d 785 (Me. 1971).  Rather,\r\n\"[i]t is sufficient that there is a reasonable generalized gamut of greater than ordinary dangers of injury and that the sustaining of the injury was within this\r\nrange â€¦. It was, therefore, a jury question whether the defendant had provided reasonably safe premises . . . for the use of the . . . invitee.  Hughes, 269 S.C. at\r\n397-98, 237 S.E.2d at 757 (quoting Orr, 280 A.2d at 794).\r\n\r\nC.  Licensees\r\n\r\nA licensee is a person who is privileged to enter or remain upon land by virtue of the possessor's consent.  Neil v. Byrum, 288 S.C. 472, 343 S.E.2d 615 (1986);\r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 330 (1965).  Cf. Bryant v. City of North Charleston, 304 S.C. 123, 403 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 1991)(since Neil defines standard\r\nof care owed licensee, not public invitee, there was no error by trial judge not to charge Neil to jury where 80-year old woman tripped and fell over barricade\r\nplaced over depression on public sidewalk).  When a licensee enters onto the property of another, the primary benefit is to the licensee, not the property owner. \r\nHoover v. Broome, 324 S.C. 531, 479 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 1996); Landry v. Hilton Head Plantation Prop. Owner's Ass'n, Inc., 317 S.C. 200, 452 S.E.2d 619\r\n(Ct. App. 1994).  A licensee is a person whose presence is tolerated, a person not necessarily invited on the premises, but one who is privileged to enter or\r\nremain on the premises only by the property owner's express or implied consent.  Frankel v. Kurtz, 239 F. Supp. 713 (W.D.S.C. 1965).\r\n\r\nThe most common example of a licensee is the social guest.  See F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 111 (2d ed. 1997).  See also\r\nFrankel, 239 F. Supp. at 717 (\"A social guest is a licensee\"; as such, he enters the premises by virtue of the possessor's consent).  \"An injured person has been\r\nheld to be a licensee where he entered premises to seek a favor, to make inquiries or ask directions, to do volunteer work, to use recreational facilities without\r\nasking specific permission, to recover an item of personal property left on the premises, to obtain some article of value given to the licensee by the occupant, or\r\nwhile chasing his dog.\"  62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises Liability Â§ 111 (1990)(footnotes omitted).  In Neil v. Byrum, our Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possessor is under no obligation to exercise care to make the premises safe for his reception, and is under no duty toward him except:\r\n\r\n  \r\n(a) To use reasonable care to discover him and avoid injury to him in carrying on activities upon the land.\r\n\r\n(b) To use reasonable care to warn him of any concealed dangerous conditions or activities which are known to the possessor, or of any change in the condition\r\nof the premises which may be dangerous to him, and which he may reasonably be expected to discover.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNeil, 288 S.C. at 473, 343 S.E.2d at 616 (emphasis in original)(quoting Frankel, 239 F. Supp. at 717).\r\n\r\nTherefore, \"[s]ince a licensee is there for his own benefit, he can be said to accept the premises as they are and demand no greater safety than his host provides\r\nhimself.\"  Hubbard &amp; Felix, supra, at 111&nbsp;(emphasis in original).\r\n\r\nD.  Status of a Meter Reader\r\n\r\nAlthough the duty of care a business owes its customers or other persons has been established, South Carolina has not addressed the specific issue of whether a\r\nmeter reader or other public works employee is a licensee or an invitee.  The basic distinction between a licensee and an invitee is that an invitee confers a\r\nbenefit on the landowner.  Crocker v. Barr, 305 S.C. 406, 409 S.E.2d 368 (1991); Landry v. Hilton Head Plantation Prop. Owners Ass'n, Inc., 317 S.C. 200,\r\n452 S.E.2d 619 (Ct. App. 1994).  See also Hubbard &amp; Felix, supra, at 110-11 (the licensee \"is there for his own purpose rather than to benefit the\r\nowner/occupier.\").  Further, while on premises conferring some benefit to the landowner, the invitee is entitled to a higher duty of care.  Unlike a licensee, an\r\ninvitee enters the premises with the implied assurance of preparation and reasonable care for his protection and safety while he is there.  Landry, 317 S.C. at\r\n203, 452 S.E.2d at 621; Bryant v. City of North Charleston, 304 S.C. 123, 403 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 1991); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 341A cmt. a\r\n(1965).\r\n\r\nWhen a SCE&amp;G meter reader enters a customer's property, the meter reader does so in furtherance of the contract to supply power between the landowner and\r\nSCE&amp;G.  The landowner benefits by his consumption of the power and SCE&amp;G, in turn, benefits by knowing the rate of the landowner's use of power.\r\n\r\nIn essence, SCE&amp;G is a private utility company engaged in the business of supplying power to landowners.  In furtherance of that business, SCE&amp;G enters into\r\na contract with the landowner to supply power to the particular location.  Under the totality of the relationship, the meter reader is a business invitee.  See W.\r\nPage Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§ 61, at 429 (5th ed. 1984)(\"Where it can be found that the public employee comes for a purpose\r\nwhich has some connection with business transacted on the premises by the occupier, he is almost invariably treated as an invitee. . . . It is no doubt possible to\r\nspell out pecuniary benefit to the occupier in the case of . . . a city water meter reader.\").  Stated another way, \"[a] public utility employee who comes upon\r\npremises for the purpose of reading a meter or checking, installing, or maintaining the utility equipment is generally accorded the status of an invitee, and\r\naccordingly the person in occupation or control of the premises owes him a duty of exercising reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe for the\r\ncontemplated use.\"  62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises Liability Â§ 452 (1990). \r\n\r\n\"The contention that a meter reader is not specifically invited onto the premises and is therefore only a licensee has been rejected.\"  Id. Â§ 453.  Even in South\r\nCarolina, \"[p]ublic employees like water meter readers are generally regarded as invitees.\"  F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 113\r\n(2d ed. 1997).\r\n\r\nWe recently discussed the issue of the duty of care owed a worker performing his duties on the landowner's property in Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light,\r\n340 S.C. 438, 531 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 2000).  As Larimore was walking around a house inspecting the exterior vinyl siding he installed, he was injured when\r\nhe stepped on a narrow trench that had been improperly compacted by CP&amp;L employees.  This Court found that \"[b]ecause Larimore, [the vinyl siding\r\nsubcontractor/installer], was a business visitor invited to enter or remain on the property for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with [the landowner],\r\nLarimore was an invitee.\"  Id. at 444, 531 S.E.2d at 538.  However, despite determining Larimore was a business invitee, we decided the case in favor of the\r\nlandowner on other grounds.  The Court noted a landowner is not an insurer of safety.  Because Larimore failed to appeal the trial court's ruling the danger was\r\nopen and obvious, that ruling was the law of the case.\r\n\r\nLikewise, in Wilson v. Duke Power Co., 273 S.C. 610, 258 S.E.2d 101 (1979), our Supreme Court classified a construction worker as an invitee.  Wilson was\r\ninjured while installing a roof on a building that was built too close to overhead power lines.  He was electrocuted and fell from the roof.  In concluding there\r\nwas ample evidence to support the jury's finding the landowner was negligent and reckless, the Court observed it was \"not disputed that Wilson was, as a\r\nbusiness invitee, entitled to at least a warning of any unsafe conditions of which the landowner knew or should have known, and of which the invitee was,\r\nreasonably, not aware.\"  Id. at 615, 258 S.E.2d at 104 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nE.  Law From Other Jurisdictions\r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions have found that \"[i]n actions for personal injury to meter readers or similar public service employees coming upon premises in connection\r\nwith the utilities supplied thereto, the courts have usually treated the employee as an invitee of the person responsible for the maintenance of the premises and\r\naccordingly have imposed the ordinary duty of a landowner to an invitee, that is, the exercise of reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe for the\r\ncontemplated use, or at least to warn of dangers not open and obvious.\"  J.D. Perovich, Annotation, Liability of Owner or Operator of Premises for Injury to\r\nMeter Reader or Similar Employee of Public Service Corporation Coming to Premises in Course of Duties, 28 A.L.R.3d 1344, 1346 (1969)(footnotes omitted). \r\nFor example, in Indiana, \"[m]eter readers are considered invitees.\"  Ross v. Lowe, 619 N.E.2d 911, 914 (Ind. 1993)(utility meter reader brought action against\r\nlandowner for injuries sustained when he was attacked by family dog, which was locked in landowner's house by his 12-year old daughter with only screen\r\ndoor, which the dog crashed through and knocked down meter reader; jury question whether negligence of daughter is imputed to parents). \r\n\r\nGenerally, utility workers and other repairmen on premises are classified as invitees because of their relationship with the landowner.  These invitees have\r\npermission to be on premises because of a contractual relationship between the parties.  In addition to meter readers and repairmen on premises, other workers\r\nperforming services under a contractual relationship are considered invitees.  \"It has generally been held, either expressly or impliedly, that a garbage or trash\r\nman, while performing services for the owner, is an invitee, to whom the duty of exercising reasonable and ordinary care is owed by the owner or occupant in\r\nthe operation and maintenance of its place of business or premises to avoid injuring him, but where he exceeds the scope of his invitation or performs an act\r\nwhich is not covered by his invitation, recovery has been denied by the court.\"  Robert L. Simpson, Annotation, Premises Liability: Liability of Owner or\r\nOccupant to Garbage or Trash Man Coming on Premises in Course of Duty, 36 A.L.R.3d 610, 612-13 (1971)(footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nGeorgia has classified meter readers as invitees when they are on premises in the capacity of their job as a meter reader.  In Sheffield Co. v. Phillips, 24 S.E.2d\r\n834 (Ga. Ct. App. 1943), H.H. Phillips, an employee of the Georgia Power Company, was reading an electric meter at a store building owned by the Sheffield\r\nCompany because the regular meter reader was on vacation.  The meter was located near the rear door to the building on the inside rear wall of the first floor. \r\nThis door was used by the public as a back entrance and as a throughway for bringing merchandise into the building and into the basement.  Inside this entrance,\r\nthe company maintained a freight elevator; however, no signs were at this entrance indicating the existence of the elevator.  Because merchandise was stacked\r\nin his way, Phillips had to stand within a few steps on the inside of the doorway while reading the meter.  Phillips was not aware this was the first floor resting\r\nplace of the elevator.  As he was reading the meter, the elevator lowered to the first floor without warning, struck Phillips, and injured him.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Georgia ruled Phillips was an invitee and decided \"[t]here is no merit in the contention that [Phillips] was a mere licensee on the\r\npremises.\"  Id. at 838.  The court based its conclusion, in part, on contractual grounds. (2)  Georgia Power Company supplied power to Sheffield and needed\r\nmeter readers to determine proper billing.  The power supply contract created an \"implied invitation\" to enter the land.  Id.  The Sheffield court emphasized:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff was an invitee on the premises of the defendant at the time he was injured.  His employer, the power company, furnished the electric current to the\r\ndefendant under a contract.  The plaintiff was on the premises of the defendant at the time he was injured in order to read the meter on the premises.  The\r\nreading of the meter was in furtherance of the contract between the defendant and the power company for the latter to furnish current to the defendant, and it\r\nwas to the interest of the defendant, as well as to that of the power company, that the meter be read so as to determine the amount of current used by the\r\ndefendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSheffield Co., 24 S.E.2d at 838.\r\n\r\nGeorgia was not the first jurisdiction that classified public works employees as invitees.  Prior decisions from other jurisdictions reflect, in part, that an express\r\nor implied invitation arises from the contractual relationship between the parties.  See, e.g., Finnegan v. Fall River Gas-Works Co., 34 N.E. 523 (Mass. 1893).\r\n\r\nIn Washington Gas Light Co. v. Eckloff, 4 App. D.C. 174 (D.C. Cir. 1894), a municipal water meter inspector was injured when gas from one of The\r\nWashington Gas Light Company's pipes leaked and gas accumulated in the pit where the water meter was located.  Eckloff smelled gas but was told by the gas\r\ncompany superintendent that the smell was not real gas but only \"dead gas.\"  Nevertheless, when Eckloff lit a candle to read the meter, he caused an explosion\r\nof the collected gas.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found no error in the instruction to the jury concerning the requisite standard of care\r\nowed an invitee.  The judge charged the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first question which you should be informed about is what degree of care it was incumbent upon this defendant to observe in keeping their premises safe.\r\n\r\nI may say generally that it is bound to observe precisely the same degree of care that devolves upon each one of you with respect to your private dwelling; no\r\nmore and no less. . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington Gas Light Co., 4 App. D.C. at 182.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, in Bradley v. Sobolewsky, 99 A. 1067 (Conn. 1917), dealt with the theory of \"express license.\"  Edwin Bradley,\r\nan employee of the New Haven Gaslight Company, was sent by his employer to Vincent Sobolewsky's home to check a gas range which was supposedly out of\r\norder.  Unfortunately, Bradley was sent to the wrong house and, as he approached the back door via a path leading from the front gate, he was attacked by\r\nSobolewsky's dog.  The trial judge ruled in favor of Sobolewsky finding Bradley was committing a trespass when he was bitten by the dog.\r\n\r\nThe appellate court reversed and ordered a new trial concluding Bradley was not a trespasser but was on the premises by virtue of an \"express license.\"  Id. at\r\n1068.  Sobolewsky had signed a service contract with the gas company which allowed its employees access for the purpose of examining its gas piping and\r\napparatus.  The court determined:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think it is clear that the plaintiff was at the time of the injury acting as the agent of the gas company authorized to examine gas apparatus on the defendant's\r\npremises.  It is true that the authority afterwards appeared to have been given to him as the result of a mistake; but the mistake was made by the company in\r\ndirecting the plaintiff to the wrong place, and not by the plaintiff in going to a place to which he was not authorized to go.  In going to the defendant's premises,\r\nhe went precisely where the gas company told him to go and for a purpose for which the defendant had agreed that the authorized agent of the company might\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\nBradley, 99 A. at 1068.  Even though Bradley was incorrect in entering Sobolewsky's yard for the express purpose of repairing a gas range, he otherwise had\r\nthe implied invitation to come on the premises anyway.\r\n\r\nThe duty of care owed invitees can flow from any person or entity that has control over the property.  In Kennedy v. Heisen, 182 Ill. App. 200 (Ill. App. Ct.\r\n1913), Thomas Kennedy, a water inspector, was killed when he entered the engine room of Charles Heisen's building and stepped on a large belt which carried\r\nhim beneath the floor and into the fly wheel.  Heisen had leased the premises to Anderson &amp; Co. for ten years and, as part of the lease, required Anderson &amp; Co.\r\nto install their own water meter.  As required by Chicago regulations, a city water inspector had to examine the property and install a meter.  Heisen knew an\r\ninspector would be sent to inspect the premises before the City Commissioner of Public Works would grant a permit to tap the water main and install a meter. \r\nThe Appellate Court of Illinois amplified:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether the circumstances make a case of invitation in the technical sense of that word as used in many adjudged cases, or only a case of mere\r\nlicense is not free from difficulty.  The difficulty is not in ascertaining what is the law, but in applying it to the facts of the case.  When a person is a mere\r\nlicensee he has no cause of action on account of an injury received through the negligence of the licensor in the place he is permitted to enter.  In Campbell on\r\nNegligence, quoted by Mr. Justice Harlan in Bennett v. Lousiville &amp; N.R. Co., 102 U.S. [577], 585 [(1880)], it is said: \"The principle appears to be that\r\ninvitation is to be inferred where there is a common interest or mutual advantage, while a license is inferred where the object is the mere pleasure or comfort of\r\nthe person using it.\"  Here there was a common interest in the work between Heisen and the deceased and it was to their mutual advantage that the inspection be\r\nmade-to Heisen's because such inspection was required in part performance of the covenants of his lease; to the advantage of the deceased because the making\r\nof such inspection was in the performance of the duties of his employment.  It is immaterial that the request to the superintendent of the water bureau to have\r\nthe premises inspected was made not by Heisen but by Anderson.  Heisen knew that an inspector would be sent to inspect the premises before a permit to install\r\na new connection with the water main would be granted.  The employer of the deceased was bound to make the inspection and properly sent the deceased to\r\nperform that duty, and this prevents the case from being that of one who is a mere licensee.  Holmes v. N.E. R.R. Co., L.R. 4 Exch. 254.\r\n\r\nThe deceased did not enter defendant's building under license or authority given by the law . . . .  We think that there was, in the sense in which the word is\r\nused in many of the adjudged cases, an invitation of the deceased by the defendant to go into his building to inspect the water pipes and connections, and that\r\ndeceased went into said premises by the implied invitation of the defendant and not as a mere licensee.\r\n\r\n\r\nKennedy, 182 Ill. App. at 202-03.\r\n\r\nThe party in control of the premises, however, is not an insurer of the worker's safety.  In Barry v. Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., 140 N.E.2d 198 (Mass. 1957), David\r\nBarry, a water department employee, was, at the request of Stop and Shop, investigating flooding in the cellar of the store when an overhead trap door fell and\r\nhit Barry on the head.  Generally, a landowner must warn a water department employee of known dangers of this sort.  Yet, the Barry court found there was no\r\nliability on the part of Stop &amp; Shop because \"[e]verything connected with the situation was open and obvious.  A warning by the defendant would not give the\r\nplaintiff more than he could learn at a glance.\"  Id. at 199.\r\n\r\nOther similarly situated workers on premises have been afforded the status of an invitee.  The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, in Cowan v. One\r\nHour Valet, Inc., 157 S.E.2d 843 (W. Va. 1967), followed Georgia's holding in Sheffield Co. v. Phillips, 24 S.E.2d 834 (Ga. Ct. App. 1943). (3)  Leslie Cowan,\r\nan inspector and tester of electric equipment and meters, entered the premises of One Hour Valet in connection with his duties.  Cowan was injured when he\r\nfell through the floor in a back room of the dry cleaning business.  In citing Sheffield and other cases, the court found:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe status of the appellant was clearly that of an invitee.  He was charged with the duties of inspecting the electrical equipment and checking the meters.  In\r\nsuch cases it is held that such inspector or a person with such duties has the status of an invitee because he was entering the premises in the performance of his\r\nduties. . . . [W]here a person has some business with the landowner there is an implied invitation to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCowan, 157 S.E.2d at 849 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).  Additionally, the court made clear \"the appellant was not only an invitee of the tenant but was\r\nan invitee of the landlord because it is clear from the evidence in this case that one of the reasons for his inspection and checking of the electrical meters located\r\nin the back room of the building owned by the appellees was to avoid and correct any situation that may have existed that would create a fire hazard to the\r\nbuilding.\"  Id.  The court further noted Cowan \"was not only an invitee of the appellees but was there on the premises for the benefit of the appellees or\r\nlandowner.\"  Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe party in control of the premises is generally obligated to exercise the appropriate level of care to keep the premises safe for other persons performing work\r\non the premises.  In Pennsylvania, a subcontractor on a construction job owes to employees of other subcontractors, on the same site, the care due a business\r\nvisitor from a possessor of land.  See McKenzie v. Cost Bros., Inc., 409 A.2d 362 (Pa. 1979).\r\n\r\nThis principle was elucidated in Duffy v. Fischbach &amp; Moore, Inc., 126 A.2d 413 (Pa. 1956).  James Duffy, an employee of a subcontractor hired to install\r\ntelephones in a newly erected building, was injured when he tripped over an extension cord placed in a poorly lit hallway by employees of the carpenter\r\nsubcontractors.  Duffy filed an action against the Peterson Company, the carpenter subcontractors, and Fischbach &amp; Moore, the electrical subcontractors.\r\n\r\nIn affirming a judgment for Duffy, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania cited the Restatement of Torts Â§ 332, which defines business visitors as \"those who\r\ncome upon the land for a purpose which is connected with their own business which itself is directly or indirectly connected with any purpose, business or\r\notherwise, for which the possessor used the land.\"  This language is similar to the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 332(3) (1965), which reads: \"A business\r\nvisitor is a person who is invited to enter or remain on land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the possessor of the land.\" \r\nThe court enunciated:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll individual sub-contractors engaged in a common enterprise owe to each other the duty of care required to business visitors. . . . The Western Electric\r\nCompany, employer of the plaintiff, was on the premises of the Alcoa Building furthering its work which was connected with the business purpose for which\r\nFischbach &amp; Moore and the Peterson Company were also there, namely, the building of the Alcoa skyscraper.  The duty which Fischbach &amp; Moore and the\r\nPeterson Company owed to the employees of the [general contractor], they owed equally as well to the employees of their fellow sub-contractors who in turn,\r\nowed a similar duty to [the general contractor] and others engaged in the same building operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuffy, 126 A.2d at 416.\r\n\r\nIn Massey v. F.H. McGraw &amp; Co., 233 F.2d 905 (6th Cir. 1956), Paul Massey, an inspector with a Kentucky architectural firm, was injured while performing an\r\non-site inspection of the contractor's work.  A rung on a ladder made with scrap wood by the contractor broke as Massey was descending into a ditch to inspect\r\nsome water pipe welds.  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found the inspector was an invitee, \"rather than a mere licensee.\"  Id. at 907.  The court further\r\nilluminated:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presence of the [inspector] was not wholly disconnected from any benefit or service to the [contractor], . . . but was for the mutual benefit of both parties. \r\nAccordingly, the [contractor] owed to the [inspector] a duty to use ordinary care to have the premises and appliances in a reasonably safe condition for use in a\r\nmanner consistent with the purpose of the invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMassey, 233 F.2d at 907 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nThe case of Fred Howland, Inc. v. Morris, 196 So. 472 (Fla. 1940), is enlightening.  Walter Morris, a city of Miami building inspector, was injured while taking\r\nan inspection tour of a partially completed building when he fell through the floor.  The concrete floor had not been poured, so the inspector could only stand on\r\nthe floor's \"pan,\" one of a series of forms which would eventually hold the concrete.  The Supreme Court of Florida concluded the inspector was a business\r\ninvitee:\r\n\r\n\r\nA building inspector, while his presence is in part a necessity, is present also by virtue of an implied contractual relationship with the city, wherein the city\r\ngrants a permit to build, provided the city, through its authorized agents, is allowed to make detailed inspections of the component parts of the building as they\r\nare assembled.  The inspector is on the premises for a purpose connected with the business in which the owner or occupant is engaged or which he permits to be\r\nconducted on the premises, and there is a mutuality of interest in the subject to which the inspector's presence relates. . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n. . . \"Invitation of the owner or occupant is implied by law where the person goes on the premises for the benefit, real or supposed, of the owner or occupant, or\r\nin a matter of mutual interest, or in the usual course of business, or for the performance of some duty.  And the owner or person in possession of the premises\r\nowes it as a duty to those who come on the premises by invitation, express or implied, to exercise reasonable or ordinary care to keep and maintain his premises\r\nin safe condition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFred Howland, Inc., 196 So. at 476 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).  See also Helton v. Norbom, 492 So. 2d 729 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986)(citing Fred\r\nHowland, Inc., for the proposition that an implied contractual relationship between a city supplying services to an apartment complex will establish a city\r\ninspector's status as a business invitee).\r\n\r\nIn Painter v. Hudson Trust Co., 126 A. 636 (N.J. 1924), Wid Painter, a foreman employed by the New York Telephone Company, was injured when an iron\r\nventilator fell from the wall of an old building owned by the Hudson Trust Company and struck Painter.  Hudson had just finished moving into a new building\r\nand its old building was to be demolished.  Painter, after connecting the phone lines to the new facility, was charged with cutting the lines into the old building. \r\nThe trial judge charged the jury that Painter was merely a licensee and, therefore, any contributory negligence on the part of Painter in knocking the ventilator\r\nwith his ladder could bar his recovery completely.  However, the jury disregarded any contributory negligence and returned a verdict in favor of Painter.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed the jury verdict but criticized the jury charge.  The court declared Painter was an invitee because his work conferred\r\nsome benefit on Hudson.  The court expounded:\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he charge erroneously limited the obligation of the defendant to that of a mere licensor, while, under the undisputed facts of the case, the duty imposed upon\r\nit with regard to affording protection to the plaintiff, while engaged in his work, was that imposed upon a person who invites another upon his premises to\r\nperform some act for his benefit.  The defendant company had asked the telephone company to install a telephone service in the new unit; and this included, as\r\nwe think, the removal of the old service from the building that was about to be torn down.  It was in compliance with this request that the plaintiff was present\r\nat the place of the accident.  Being an invitee, it is quite immaterial whether the ventilator fell because of the ladder being pushed against it or for some other\r\nreason; for, clearly, if the attachment of the ventilator to the wall had become so insecure that it was a menace to the safety of anybody engaged in removing the\r\nold telephone service, the defendant company was plainly negligent in permitting such a condition to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nPainter, 126 A. at 637.\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Court of Indiana was faced with a situation where the invitee status was inferred in Rink v. Lowry, 77 N.E. 967 (Ind. App. 1906).  Jean Lowry\r\nwas employed as a telephone repairman who was sent by the New Telephone Company to fix the phone batteries at the Rink Flats.  The batteries were located\r\nin the bottom of the building's elevator shaft.  Lowry asked Mallory Miller, a janitor who had general control of the building, and Homer Johnson, the elevator\r\noperator, not to use the elevator while he was working.  The elevator, nevertheless, was used and Lowry was injured when the elevator counterweights came\r\ndown on top of him.  The defendants argued Lowry was a licensee because he was there solely for the benefit of the telephone company.  The court found\r\nLowry was fixing the phones for the mutual benefit of the landowner as well as the telephone company.  \"The invitation may be inferred from the facts proven\";\r\ntherefore, the \"Appellee was not a mere licensee.\"  Id. at 970.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a worker on premises loses an invitee status when the worker exceeds the scope of the work.  \"If the invitee goes outside of the area of his\r\ninvitation, he becomes a trespasser or a licensee, depending upon whether he goes there without the consent of the possessor, or with such consent.\" \r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 332 cmt. l (1965).\r\n\r\nThe loss of invitee status is usually a question for the jury.  In Philibert v. Benjamin Ansehl Co., 119 S.W.2d 797 (Mo. 1938), Benjamin Philibert, employed by\r\nthe Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in St. Louis, was injured when a shelf of about 400 cartons of empty jars fell on him.  Philibert was installing a\r\nprivate telephone exchange in defendant's new facility.  For the installation, he needed a wooden box constructed to cover pipes that were sticking through the\r\nfloor where the phone bank was to be installed.  When Philibert was in the factory room portion of the building talking to the employee responsible for\r\nconstructing the box, the shelf fell on him.\r\n\r\nThe issue examined by the Supreme Court of Missouri was whether Philibert, when he went into the factory section of the building, retained his status as an\r\ninvitee.  The defendant claimed Philibert could not recover because he was, when injured, at a place to which he was not actually or impliedly invited.  The\r\ncourt determined \"the question of whether plaintiff exceeded the scope of his invitation by going to the factory room to see about the box was one for the jury.\" \r\nId. at 801.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold meter readers enter premises in furtherance of a mutual benefit to the landowner as well as the utility company.  We rule that, because Sims was a\r\nbusiness visitor invited to enter or remain on the property for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with the business of and for the mutual benefit of Giles,\r\nSims was an invitee.  We adopt the widespread contractual analysis of establishing either an implied or express invitation for a meter reader to come on\r\npremises.  Our holding conforms with the common understanding of jurisdictions that have retained the distinctions between invitee and licensee status. \r\nAccordingly, the order of the Circuit Court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n1. Callander was distinguished by Larimore, 340 S.C. at 445, 531 S.E.2d at 539, based on a landowner's knowledge of a potentially dangerous defect on his\r\nproperty.  Unlike the property owner in Larimore, the shop owner in Callander had actual notice of a defective stool and the fact that his elderly customers\r\nfrequently backed into the stools to sit down.  Thus, a jury question arose in Callander whether the doughnut shop owner should have anticipated the harm\r\nresulting from an elderly customer backing to sit down on a broken stool, which, in fact, happened.\r\n2. The Sheffield court additionally relied on Ga. Code Ann. Â§ 105-401 (1933), now Ga. Code Ann Â§ 51-3-1 (2000), which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in\r\ndamages to such persons for injuries caused by his failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nGa. Code Ann Â§ 51-3-1 (2000).\r\n3. West Virginia, however, has recently abandoned the common law distinctions between licensees and invitees on premises.  In Mallet v. Pickens, 522 S.E.2d\r\n436 (W. Va. 1999), the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia decided to follow the \"modern trend\" of only maintaining a distinction between trespassers\r\nand others:\r\n\r\n\r\n[O]ur research reveals that at least 25 jurisdictions have abolished or largely abandoned the licensee/invitee distinction.  Among these 25 jurisdictions that have\r\nbroken with past tradition, at least 17 have eliminated or fundamentally altered the distinction.  Another eight of the 25 have eliminated even the trespasser\r\ndistinction. And, of those retaining the old scheme, judges in at least five of those states have authored vigorous dissents or concurrences arguing for change.\r\n\r\n\r\nMallet, 522 S.E.2d at 444-45 (footnotes omitted)(South Carolina is not one of the 25 jurisdictions cited by the court).  Expressly, the court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nToday we hold that the common law distinction between licensees and invitees is hereby abolished; landowners or possessors now owe any non-trespassing\r\nentrant a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances.  We retain our traditional rule with regard to a trespasser, that being that a landowner or possessor\r\nneed only refrain from willful or wanton injury.  Though our decision might seem a radical departure from past cases, in its basic philosophy it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\nMallet, 522 S.E.2d at 446.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3292","title":"Davis v.

Dunn, II, of Dunn, Dunn &amp; Mitchell, both of Columbia, for\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:   In this wrongful discharge action, the Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement Commission (\"OCLEC\")\r\nappeals from a jury verdict in favor of Joshua Davis. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1985,Orangeburg County, Calhoun County, and the City of Orangeburg formed the Orangeburg-Calhoun Regional\r\nLaw Enforcement Commission to provide facilities for incarceration of prisoners.  A detention center was established and\r\noperated by this joint commission, composed of representatives appointed by the governing bodies of all three entities.  The\r\ndetention center included a canteen from which inmates and staff could purchase drinks, snacks, cigarettes, and sundries. The\r\nmoney generated from the canteen and the pay telephones was known as the \"canteen fund.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the relevant times, James Gordon was the Director of the Detention Center.  In 1990, Joshua Davis applied for the\r\nposition of Deputy Director.  Davis told Gordon that he had a bachelor's degree in marketing and accounting and at least thirty\r\nhours of college credit in accounting. (1)  Gordon hired Davis, and assigned him the task of establishing an accounting system\r\nfor the canteen fund so that it could be properly audited.  At that time there were no policies or procedures governing the\r\nhandling of the canteen fund.\r\n\r\nDavis drafted policies and procedures which the commission revised and adopted in 1991.  Under these procedures, Davis had\r\nprimary responsibility for counting, verifying, and maintaining the cash receipts, as well as verifying the deposit of funds by an\r\nadministrative assistant.  Davis reconciled the fund records and reported monthly in writing to the commission.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the City of Orangeburg withdrew from the commission.  Orangeburg and Calhoun Counties repealed their enabling\r\nordinances and created a new commission.  Although Davis argues in his brief that Calhoun County did not follow Orangeburg\r\nCounty's lead in abolishing the \"old\" OCLEC by amending the Calhoun ordinance, it is clear that Calhoun County also\r\nabolished the old OCLEC. Calhoun County ordinance 92-5 \"abolish[es] the existing commission and establish[es] a new\r\ncommission.\" Seven members were appointed to the new OCLEC, including some who had served on the previous\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nIn June 1993, the OCLEC approved a canteen fund policy largely promulgated by Davis, which required an annual audit.  A\r\ncertified public accountant audited the fund for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, reporting no problems.  In November\r\n1994, Davis reported a $1,250 expense for the 1994 audit of the canteen fund, leading the OCLEC to believe an audit had been\r\nperformed for that year. (2)   In 1995 the canteen fund audit was added to the bid package with other Orangeburg County audits,\r\nand the county selected a different accounting firm to conduct the audit.\r\n\r\nIn November 1995, the new auditor reported to the OCLEC that the Detention Center did not have sufficient records to audit\r\nthe canteen fund.  A committee was formed to investigate, and a bookkeeper was hired to put the records into ledger form. \r\nLater that month, an OCLEC commissioner reviewed the records and concluded that they did not agree with the monthly\r\nreports Davis had presented to the OCLEC.\r\n\r\nIn early January 1996, the bookkeeper and several OCLEC commissioners met with Davis and Gordon at the Detention Center\r\nto inventory the canteen.  Davis allegedly told them he did not consider it necessary to set up the account on a ledger system\r\nand insisted the fund could be audited as it was.  Contrary to Davis's position, OCLEC commissioners testified that they spent\r\nin excess of 100 hours trying to reconcile the records, and eventually concluded more than $30,000 was missing.\r\n\r\nAt the OCLEC's meeting in January 1996, the OCLEC unanimously adopted the investigating committee report recommending\r\nthat Davis be discharged for cause, that Gordon be reprimanded, that the matter be referred to the Solicitor's office, and that a\r\nState Law Enforcement Division (SLED) investigation be requested.  The OCLEC Chairman then instructed Gordon to\r\nimmediately terminate Davis's employment, which Gordon did.  Subsequently, Gordon sent Davis an official termination letter\r\nwhich stated the reason for Davis's termination as  \"incompetence and violation of policy in handling the Canteen Fund.\" It\r\nfurther stated, \"This decision is based on an investigation of the Canteen Fund precipitated by the 1995 Auditor's Report.\"\r\n\r\nDavis grieved his termination to the OCLEC's grievance committee, which denied his grievance.  Davis then filed this action\r\nfor breach of employment contract and related claims against Gordon and two OCLEC commissioners. The trial court granted\r\nsummary judgment on the related claims.\r\n\r\nDavis's breach of contract claim was tried before a jury.  The jury returned a verdict for Davis in the amount of $305,000.  The\r\nOCLEC moved to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which the trial court denied.  This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe OCLEC argues the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict, or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because\r\nDavis failed to present evidence sufficient to raise a factual issue as to alteration of his at-will employment status. We agree.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we must consider the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Brady Dev. Co. v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 78,\r\n439 S.E.2d 266, 269 (1993); McGill v. Univ. of South Carolina, 310 S.C. 224, 226, 423 S.E.2d 109, 111 (1992).  A directed\r\nverdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict should not be granted unless only one reasonable inference can be drawn from\r\nthe evidence. Brady Dev. Co., 312 S.C. at 78, 439 S.E.2d at 269. \"Our courts have recognized that when only one reasonable\r\ninference can be deduced from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for the court.\"\r\nSmall v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329\r\nS.C. 448, 461, 494 S.E.2d 835, 841 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nDavis asserts two bases for arguing that his original at-will status was altered by the OCLEC.  These are: 1) the adoption of an\r\nOCLEC policy manual; and 2) a statement he maintains Director Gordon made to him when he was hired.  In response, the\r\nOCLEC argues that the policy manual relied upon by Davis was never adopted by the OCLEC, is inapplicable under the\r\ncircumstances, and is too vague to have altered Davis' at-will status. The OCLEC also maintains that Gordon's alleged\r\nstatement was insufficient to establish a contract altering the at-will relationship.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of employment at-will has long been recognized in the State of South Carolina.   See \r\nShealy v. Fowler, 182 S.C.\r\n81, 188 S.E. 499 (1936).  The doctrine dictates that employment for an indefinite term is terminable by either the employee or\r\nthe employer for any reason or for no reason without incurring liability for wrongful discharge.\r\nCuller v. Blue Ridge Elec.\r\nCoop., 309 S.C.  243, 245, 422 S.E.2d 91, 92 (1992); Hudson v. Zenith Engraving Co., 273 S.C. 766, 769, 259 S.E.2d 812, 813\r\n(1979).\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has carved out two explicit exceptions to this general rule.  First, an employee has recourse against an employer\r\nfor termination in violation of public policy.  Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 300 S.C. 481, 484, 388 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1990).\r\nSecond, an employee has a cause of action against an employer who contractually alters the at-will relationship and terminates\r\nthe employee in violation of the contract. Id.  \r\nIn certain situations, termination of an at-will employee may give rise to a cause\r\nof action for wrongful termination where the at-will status of the employee is altered by the terms of an employee handbook.\r\nId.  Thus, while the doctrine of employment at-will is the law in this state, our supreme court has held that a jury can consider\r\nan employee handbook in deciding whether the employer and the employee had a limiting agreement on the employee's at-will\r\nemployment status. Kumpf v. United Tel. Co., 311 S.C. 533, 536, 429 S.E.2d 869, 871  (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nIn order to prove the existence of a contract, the employee must show \"the following three elements: 1) a specific offer, 2)\r\ncommunication of the offer to the employee, and 3) performance of job duties in reliance on the offer.\"  Prescott v. Farmers\r\nTel. Coop., 335 S.C. 330, 336, 516 S.E.2d 923, 926 (1999).\r\n\r\nI.  Policy Manual\r\n\r\nWith regard to the policy manual, Davis argues the OCLEC contractually altered his at-will status through promises contained\r\nin the Detention Center's policy and procedure manual. (3)  He maintains the OCLEC breached the terms of his employment\r\ncontract in at least two ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, Policy A-260 of the manual states the \"initiation of discipline is the responsibility of the Director.\"  Davis asserts that his\r\ndiscipline could, therefore, only be instigated by Director Gordon with the OCLEC serving as the final approving authority. \r\nAccordingly, the OCLEC improperly terminated him by not following this procedure.\r\n\r\nSecond, he contends the OCLEC violated Policy A-235 when it discharged him without justification. Davis maintains that\r\nPolicy A-235 alters his at-will employment to a contract for employment with termination only for cause.\r\n\r\nThe OCLEC minutes do not reflect that the policies Davis relies upon were ever adopted by the OCLEC.  The minutes are\r\nsilent on the issue.  At trial, the OCLEC objected to the introduction of the manual into evidence, which was overruled.  On\r\nappeal, the OCLEC argues this was error.  We agree.\r\n\r\nParol evidence may not be admitted to explain, enlarge or contradict minutes which are complete and unambiguous on their\r\nface. Berkeley Elec. Coop. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 308 S.C. 205, 208, 417 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1992).  \"Otherwise, parol\r\nevidence could render official minutes uncertain or unreliable so that the minutes would fail to afford dependable evidence of\r\nthe proceedings . . . .\" Id.; see also Moore v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 202 S.C. 225, 236, 24 S.E.2d 361, 365 (1943) (stating\r\nthat where company's Pension and Benefit Committee was required to keep minutes of meetings, the original minutes of the\r\nmeetings were the best evidence of changes in the pension plan and parol testimony was properly excluded).  A court must\r\ninitially review the minutes to determine whether the minutes are incomplete or ambiguous and whether parol evidence is\r\nadmissible to then clarify them.  Berkeley Elec. Coop., 308 S.C. at 209, 417 S.E.2d at 582 (holding that, after review, the\r\nminutes were unambiguous and the trial judge erred in admitting parol evidence).\r\n\r\nThe OCLEC enabling ordinances require a full and accurate account of the OCLEC's actions and doings at all times. \r\nAdditionally, all public bodies are required to keep written minutes of their public meetings recording \"the substance of all\r\nmatters proposed, discussed or decided.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-90(a)(3) (1991).\r\n\r\nDavis testified that he was responsible for preparing and presenting the minutes of OCLEC meetings.  He offered into evidence\r\nOCLEC minutes recording the adoption of other policies, including the canteen fund policy.  However, these minutes do not\r\nshow that the OCLEC adopted  the policies upon which Davis relies.  Davis's parol testimony that the policies were adopted\r\nand in force was not admissible on this point. Berkeley Elec. Coop., 308 S.C. at 208, 417 S.E.2d at 581.\r\n\r\nDavis argues that parol evidence was admissible because the minutes are ambiguous and the policies do not contradict the\r\nminutes.  We disagree.  The minutes in the record are not ambiguous on their face.  There is nothing to suggest that the OCLEC\r\ndiscussed and adopted policies not mentioned in the minutes.  Silence on the issue does not create ambiguity.  It merely reflects\r\nthat no official action was discussed or taken.  To allow parol evidence to contradict this conclusion would undermine the\r\nintegrity of the official record, in contravention of our supreme court's clear mandate in Berkeley Electric Cooperative.\r\n\r\nDavis further argues that OCLEC Commissioner Andrea Bowers testified the policies of the commission had to be \"redone\"\r\nwhen the new OCLEC was created, supporting his contention that the OCLEC reenacted all of its old policies.  However, even\r\nif this parol evidence were admissible, Bowers also testified that not all of the policies were \"redone.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, Davis argues that the presence of a date stamp on the pertinent policies supports his contention that the policies were\r\nadopted by the OCLEC and that the minutes are, therefore, ambiguous.  Again, this is inadmissible parol evidence. (4)\r\n\r\nBecause Davis' testimony regarding the adoption of the policies was inadmissible parol evidence, he has failed to establish a\r\nquestion for the jury as to whether the OCLEC made him a specific offer altering his at-will status through those policies.\r\n\r\nII. Oral Assurance\r\n\r\nDavis maintained at trial and on appeal that Gordon made a statement altering his at-will status to an employment contract\r\nallowing for termination only for cause. Davis testified that Gordon told him he could \"only be terminated for cause.\"  Davis\r\nargues this evidence is sufficient to create a factual issue as to alteration of his at-will status.  We disagree.  Assuming Gordon\r\ndid make the statement, we find it insufficient by itself to provide a factual issue as to alteration of Davis's at-will employment\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n&quot;[T]he at-will status of an employee may be altered by an oral contract of definite employment.\" Prescott, 335 S.C. at 335, 516\r\nS.E.2d at 926. \"To be binding, an offer must be definite.\" Id. at 336-37, 516 S.E.2d at 926.  One must show a specific offer, a\r\ncommunication of the offer to him, and performance of job duties in reliance on the offer.\r\nId. at 336, 516 S.E2d at 926.\r\n\r\nThe statement Davis attributed to Gordon is not definite enough to alter his at-will status. See \r\nid.; see also \r\nMontgomery County\r\nHosp. Dist. v. Brown, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex. 1998) (statements that an employee will be discharged only for \"good\r\nreason\" or \"good cause\" do not form a binding contract \"when there is no agreement on what those terms encompass. Without\r\nsuch agreement the employee cannot reasonably expect to limit the employer's right to terminate him.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDavis failed to present sufficient evidence of an alteration of his at-will employment status to establish a question for the jury. \r\nTherefore, the trial court erred in failing to grant the OCLEC's motion for directed verdict.  For the foregoing reasons the final\r\njudgment is\r\n\r\nREVERSED. (5)\r\n\r\nSTILWELL and SHULER, JJ., concur.    \r\n\r\n1.  Davis did have a degree in marketing, but his college transcript reveals he accumulated only nine credit hours in accounting courses, with one course\r\nrepeated due to a below-average grade.\r\n2.  The OCLEC later discovered the $1,250 expenditure was for inmate uniforms for the kitchen and no audit had been performed that year.\r\n3.  This manual purports to be in the nature of an employee handbook.\r\n4.   Even if admissible, Davis himself testified that the date stamped on the policies was an arbitrary date, having nothing to do\r\nwith the effective date of the policy.  Furthermore, the Canteen Fund Policy, which was adopted according to the minutes of the\r\nJune 1993 meeting, does not have a date stamp on it.  Consequently, we fail to see how this stamped date infers adoption by the\r\nOCLEC.\r\n5.\r\n   Because of our disposition of this question, it is unnecessary to address the OCLEC's remaining issues on appeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3293","title":"Wiedemann v.

Town of Hilton Head \r\n  Island, 330 S.C. 532, 500 S.E.2d 783 (1998) (Wiedemann II).\r\n\r\nHerbert Wiedemann, a Hilton Head resident, filed \r\n  an action alleging Hilton Head violated the South Carolina Freedom of Information \r\n  Act (FOIA) by holding a three-day workshop on Dataw Island, approximately 45 \r\n  miles from Hilton Head's town limits. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-10 to \r\n  -110 (1991 &amp; Supp. 1999). Wiedemann claims the Town meetings violated the \r\n  open meeting provision of the FOIA by imposing a heightened cost and delay on \r\n  the public.\r\n\r\nHilton Head, on behalf of the Town Council, moved \r\n  to dismiss Wiedemann's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. The circuit court \r\n  converted the Town's motion to one for summary judgment, and Wiedemann also \r\n  moved for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment to the Town. \r\n  Wiedemann appealed.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, this court adopted a balancing test \r\n  to determine whether the interests of the Town Council in holding an out-of-town \r\n  meeting outweighed the increased cost or delay to the public in attending the \r\n  meeting. Wiedemann I, 326 S.C. at 582, 486 S.E.2d at 268. Applying a balancing \r\n  test, this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the Town. Id.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court affirmed the use of a balancing \r\n  test but reversed the grant of summary judgment. Wiedemann II, 330 S.C. at 537, \r\n  500 S.E.2d at 785. The supreme court held the grant of summary judgment was \r\n  improper because there was insufficient evidence in the record as to why it \r\n  was necessary for the Town to conduct the meeting at Dataw Island. Id. at 537, \r\n  500 S.E.2d at 786. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the circuit court \r\n  for further evidence of the Town's reasons for holding the meetings at the remote \r\n  site. Id. at 537-38, 500 S.E.2d at 786.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing additional evidence, the circuit \r\n  court issued a declaratory judgment in favor of the Town, holding that the Town's \r\n  interests outweighed the small cost the public incurred in attending the remote \r\n  meetings. No appeal was taken from the circuit court's finding that the cost \r\n  to the public was small. Wiedemann appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWiedemann sought injunctive relief and a declaratory \r\n  judgment pursuant to the FOIA. Â§ 30-4-15. Declaratory judgments in and of themselves \r\n  are neither legal nor equitable. See Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, \r\n  356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). The standard of review for a declaratory judgment \r\n  action is therefore determined by the nature of the underlying issue. Id. \r\n\r\nActions for injunctive relief are equitable in \r\n  nature. See Miller v. Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp., 279 S.C. 90, 92, 302 S.E.2d \r\n  340, 341 (1983); Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 517, 429 S.E.2d 859, 860 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993). See also Jean Hoefer Toal, et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina \r\n  193 (1999). In equitable actions, the appellate court may review the record \r\n  and make findings of fact in accordance with its own view of a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. See Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d \r\n  287, 290-91 (2000); Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 \r\n  S.E.2d 773, 776 (1976).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWiedemann contends the circuit court erred in its \r\n  application of the balancing test and in finding the Town presented sufficient \r\n  evidence that its interest in holding the meeting at the remote site did not \r\n  violate the provisions of the FOIA. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The General Assembly finds that it is vital in \r\n    a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and public \r\n    manner so that citizens shall be advised of the performance of public officials \r\n    and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in the formulation \r\n    of public policy. Toward this end, provisions of this chapter must be construed \r\n    so as to make it possible for citizens, or their representatives, to learn \r\n    and report fully the activities of their public officials at a minimum cost \r\n    or delay to the persons seeking access to public documents or meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 30-4-15. Section 30-4-60 states \"[e]very meeting \r\n  of all public bodies shall be open to the public unless closed pursuant to Â§ \r\n  30-4-70 of this chapter.\"  \r\n  (1) \r\n\r\nThe FOIA provisions must be construed to make it \r\n  possible for the public to learn of and report on the activities of public officials. \r\n  See Â§ 30-4-15. See also Fowler v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 463, 468, 472 S.E.2d 630, \r\n  633 (1996) (\"South Carolina's FOIA was designed to guarantee the public reasonable \r\n  access to certain activities of the government.\"); Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. \r\n  291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991) (\"[T]he essential purpose of the FOIA is \r\n  to protect the public from secret government activity.\") However, nowhere in \r\n  the FOIA are public bodies required to conduct public meetings within municipal \r\n  limits. Wiedemann II, 330 S.C. at 536, 500 S.E.2d at 785. On the contrary, the \r\n  only restriction is that meetings be conducted with \"minimum cost or delay\" \r\n  to the public. Id. (quoting Â§ 30-4-15).\r\n\r\nThe Town presented considerable evidence to support \r\n  holding the workshop at Dataw Island. It presented testimony that council members \r\n  are distracted, take personal calls, and attend to personal business when meetings \r\n  are held within town boundaries. The workshop conductor testified that remote \r\n  meetings were more effective because council members were better focused, more \r\n  productive, and implemented goals faster after attending workshops at remote \r\n  locations. The retreat facilitator testified that meetings at remote locations \r\n  result in better communications and interpersonal relations within the council, \r\n  ultimately resulting in greater efficiency. The mayor of Hilton Head stated \r\n  that at a previous retreat held within the town limits he and two other council \r\n  members did not focus well because they were distracted. He said he thought \r\n  the council benefitted from the Dataw Island meetings.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the evidence, the circuit court concluded \r\n  remote meetings, such as the Dataw Island workshops, are necessary for the efficient \r\n  functioning of the Town Council. The circuit court further held that a minimum \r\n  distance necessary to achieve undistracted, uninterrupted participation by council \r\n  members is 35 to 40 miles. The circuit court found the Town presented undisputed \r\n  evidence that the Dataw Island meeting was necessary for the effective functioning \r\n  of a municipal council, and although the public incurred some small cost or \r\n  delay, \"the necessity of the Town and benefits enjoyed by the Town in being \r\n  able to hold the workshops outside of the municipal limits ... outweigh the \r\n  'cost or delay' occasioned by the public in attending the meeting.\"\r\n\r\nWiedemann urged both the circuit court and this \r\n  court to rule in his favor based on the supreme court's use of the words \"necessary\" \r\n  and \"necessity.\" Wiedemann II, 330 S.C. at 537, 500 S.E.2d at 786. In its opinion \r\n  the supreme court stated: \"[T]here are genuine issues of material fact concerning \r\n  the necessity of Town conducting the meeting outside the municipal \r\n  limits. There is simply no evidence in the record as to why \r\n  it was necessary for town to conduct the meeting at Dataw Island.\" Id. Weidemann \r\n  argues necessary and necessity mean \"indispensible, unavoidable, and essential\". \r\n  The circuit court refused to adopt Wiedemann's argument, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Town need not provide evidence that it was \"indispensable,\" \"unavoidable\" and \"essential\" for the Town to conduct the\r\nworkshop outside of its municipal limits, as is urged by the Plaintiff.  Such a literal interpretation of the words \"necessity\" and\r\n\"necessary\" as used by the Supreme Court contradicts the rationale of the balancing of interests test adopted by the Supreme\r\nCourt. If it were \"indispensable\" and \"unavoidable\" for the Town to conduct the workshop outside of the Town's limits, then\r\nthat would in and of itself justify conducting the workshop at Dataw Island Club, and there would be no reason to balance the\r\ninterest of the public in attending the workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree. Although the supreme court's opinion \r\n  uses the words \"necessary\" and \"necessity,\" the opinion clearly embraced \r\n  the application of a balancing test. Wiedemann II, 330 S.C. at 537, 500 S.E.2d \r\n  at 786. If \"necessary\" as used in the supreme court's opinion meant indispensable \r\n  and essential, as asserted by Wiedemann, there would be no need for any balancing \r\n  of interests to occur. A requirement of absolute necessity is inconsistent with \r\n  the supreme court's requirement that the trial judge balance a variety of factors \r\n  in reaching its decision.\r\n\r\nIn adopting the balancing test in Weidemann I, \r\n  this court relied heavily on Rhea v. School Bd., 636 So. 2d 1383 (Fla. Dist. \r\n  Ct. App. 1994). In Rhea, the school board conducted a meeting more than 100 \r\n  miles from its regular meeting place. The board advertised the meeting in the \r\n  local newspaper. Rhea filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief \r\n  alleging the board violated the state law requiring board meetings be open to \r\n  the public at all times. The board countered that the meeting was held in a \r\n  public meeting room in a hotel and that the hotel staff was advised to direct \r\n  any members of the public to the appropriate location.\r\n\r\nThe Rhea court found that the distance to the meeting \r\n  site and any action by the board to minimize the expense and inconvenience to \r\n  the public were factors to be considered under the balancing test. Under that \r\n  test, \"[t]he interests of the public in having a reasonable opportunity to attend \r\n  a Board workshop must be balanced against the Board's need to conduct a workshop \r\n  at a site beyond the county boundaries.\" Id. at 1385. This balancing must occur \r\n  whenever the board had a perceived need to meet outside the municipal limits. \r\n  Id. at 1386.\r\n\r\nTaking our own view of a preponderance of the evidence, we find the Town did not violate the FOIA by holding its workshop\r\nat Dataw Island.  Applying our original balancing test, we find the Town has presented sufficient evidence that its interest in\r\nincreased attention and focus outweighed the small cost and delay to the public in attending the workshop at Dataw Island.  We\r\nagree with the circuit court that the Town need not prove it was indispensable, unavoidable, or essential to conduct its\r\nworkshop outside of the municipal limits.  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is hereby\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n1.
