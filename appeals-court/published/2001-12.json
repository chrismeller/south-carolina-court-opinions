Miles, of Miles Law Firm; and Kristi F.\r\nCurtis, of Bryan, Bahnmuller, Goldman &amp;\r\nMcElveen, both of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tANDERSON, J.:   Glasscock, Inc. (\"Glasscock\") brought a\r\ndeclaratory judgment action against its insurer, United States Fidelity and\r\nGuaranty Company (\"USF&amp;G\"), seeking coverage for loss of use damages\r\nunder the underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") portion of its insurance policy.  Both\r\nparties filed motions seeking summary judgment.  The trial court originally\r\nruled for USF&amp;G, but reversed its ruling upon Glasscock's motion to alter or\r\namend the judgment.  In response, USF&amp;G filed two motions, one to vacate the\r\nruling, and the other to alter or amend the judgment.  Both motions were denied. \r\nUSF&amp;G appeals these denials.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\tOn November 19, 1997, a truck owned and operated by Glasscock was\r\ninvolved in an accident with John Vereen. Vereen maintained an insurance\r\npolicy with property damage limits of up to $25,000. Glasscock had an\r\ninsurance policy in effect with USF&amp;G, with $1,000,000 in liability coverage\r\nand $1,000,000 in UIM coverage. Glasscock contended that the amount of\r\nproperty damage to the truck and loss of use damages exceeded the $25,000\r\nproperty damage limit under Vereen's policy and brought a claim for recovery\r\nunder the UIM portion of its policy with USF&amp;G. USF&amp;G denied Glasscock's\r\nclaim for UIM benefits, stating that loss of use damages were not covered under\r\nthe \"property damage\" definition of the UIM endorsement contained in the\r\npolicy. The language of the endorsements defining \"property damage\" under\r\nthe liability and UIM sections of the policy is different.  The liability\r\nendorsement reads: \"'Property damage' means damage to or loss of use of\r\ntangible property.\"  The UIM endorsement reads: \"'Property damage' as used\r\nin this endorsement means injury to or destruction of your covered 'auto.'\"\r\n\r\n\tGlasscock commenced a declaratory judgment action to determine\r\nwhether loss of use damages were covered under the UIM portion of the policy. Both parties conceded that there were no material issues of fact in dispute and\r\nfiled motions seeking summary judgment.  On March 12, 1999, the trial court\r\ngranted USF&amp;G's motion for summary judgment stating that loss of use\r\ndamages were not covered under the UIM provision of the policy. Subsequent\r\nto this decision, Glasscock filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP. On April 23, 1999, the trial court granted Glasscock's motion\r\nand ordered that the UIM policy be reformed to cover loss of use damages under\r\nthe property damage endorsement. In response to the April 23, 1999, order,\r\nUSF&amp;G filed two motions, one to vacate pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP and one\r\nfor reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e) &amp; (f), SCRCP.  The trial court denied\r\nboth motions on November 30, 1999, and this appeal ensued.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in reforming the contract language\r\nwhen reformation was not specifically requested in\r\nGlasscock's complaint? (\"Procedural Reformation Issue\")\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in reforming the contract to include loss\r\nof use damages within the definition of \"property damage\"\r\nunder the UIM endorsement of the policy?  (\"Substantive\r\nReformation Issue\")\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Olson v. Faculty House of \r\n  Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 544 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. granted; \r\n  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999); Vermeer Carolina's, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999); \r\n  Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999); see also Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998) (stating that a trial court should grant motion for summary \r\n  judgment when pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law).\r\n\r\n In determining whether any triable issue of fact \r\n  exists, the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington County \r\n  Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. \r\n  426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997). Summary judgment is not appropriate where \r\n  further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application \r\n  of the law. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997); \r\n  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 334 S.C. 150, 511 S.E.2d 699 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999), aff'd, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000). All ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against \r\n  the moving party. Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, \r\n  511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999). Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary \r\n  facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary \r\n  judgment should be denied. Id. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, this Court reviews the grant of summary \r\n  judgment using the same standard applied by the trial court. Bray v. Marathon \r\n  Corp., Op. No. 3386 (S.C.Ct.App. filed September 10, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. \r\n  No. 33 at 81); see also Estate of Cantrell, 302 S.C. 557, 559, 397 S.E.2d 777, \r\n  778 (Ct. App. 1990) (\"On appeal from summary judgment, the reviewing court must \r\n  consider the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party. The judgment may be affirmed only if there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\") (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Procedural Reformation\r\n\r\n\tIn its brief, USF&amp;G frames the procedural reformation issue as follows: \r\n\"Did the lower court err in reforming the underinsured motorist endorsement to\r\ninclude coverage for loss of use damages where no cause of action for\r\nreformation was pled by the Respondent?\" While the substantive reformation\r\nissue was fully discussed and argued in USF&amp;G's brief, the procedural\r\nreformation issue was addressed solely in a footnote contained within the text\r\nof the argument relating to substantive reformation. The text of the footnote\r\nreads: \"In its order filed April 23, 1999, the [Circuit Court] reformed the\r\nUSF&amp;G policy to extend UIM coverage to include loss of use damages. \r\nReformation of a contract is a specific cause of action in equity.  Glasscock\r\nnever pled a cause of action for reformation.  Instead, Glasscock sought only\r\ndeclaratory relief. Therefore, the [Circuit Court] awarded relief on a cause of\r\naction never pled by either party.\"\r\n\r\n South Carolina law clearly states that short, \r\n  conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned \r\n  on appeal and therefore not presented for review. See Fields v. Melrose Ltd. \r\n  Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (\"An issue \r\n  raised on appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not \r\n  be considered by the appellate court.\"). In Brown v. Theos, 338 S.C. 305, 309 \r\n  n.2, 526 S.E.2d 232, 235 n.2 (Ct. App. 1999), aff'd, 345 S.C. 626, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  304 (2001), we held that a one sentence paragraph raised in an appellant's brief \r\n  was insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal: \"Brown states in a one sentence \r\n  paragraph that he had raised an action for 'intentionally negligent and malicious \r\n  conduct' â€¦. We note Brown's argument is so conclusory that it may be deemed \r\n  abandoned.\" (citation omitted). In this case, USF&amp;G's footnote was conclusory \r\n  and cited no supporting authority. It is insufficient to preserve the argument \r\n  for review. Additionally, even though USF&amp;G more fully addressed the issue \r\n  in its reply brief, an argument made in a reply brief cannot present an issue \r\n  to the appellate court if it was not addressed in the initial brief. See Jackson \r\n  v. Bi-Lo Stores, Inc., 313 S.C. 272, 277, 437 S.E.2d 168, 171 (Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (\"The partners make several new arguments relating to estoppel and ratification \r\n  in their reply brief. However, these arguments are not properly before this \r\n  Court because an appellant cannot make new arguments for reversal in a reply \r\n  brief.\") (citation omitted). Accordingly, we find that USF&amp;G's argument \r\n  was not properly presented to this Court and is deemed abandoned.\r\n\r\nEven if the issue were properly presented to this \r\n  Court, we find the reformation action was sufficiently stated in the complaint. \r\n  Glasscock's complaint alleges, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plaintiff has \r\n  made demand upon the Defendant for loss of use under the underinsured motorist \r\n  coverage, which the Defendant has refused to extend to the Plaintiff under the \r\n  terms of this policy, based upon the Defendant's position that rental reimbursement \r\n  is not covered as it was not defined in the endorsement. \r\n   . . . \r\n\r\n  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plaintiff is informed and \r\n  believes that there is a justiciable controversy between it and the Defendant \r\n  as the Defendant owes and owed the Plaintiff a positive legal duty to provide \r\n  underinsurance motorist coverage, and/or to make a reasonable and effective \r\n  offer of such coverage, under the laws and statutes of South Carolina, which \r\n  the Defendant failed to do.  \r\n   WHEREFORE, this Plaintiff requests that this \r\n    court issue a judgment declaring that she be entitled to loss of use under \r\n    the underinsured motorist coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n Sandy Island Corporation v. Ragsdale, 246 S.C. \r\n  414, 419, 143 S.E.2d 803, 806 (1965) states: \"The law requires a plaintiff to \r\n  state the facts constituting his cause of action and demand the relief to which \r\n  he supposes himself entitled, he is not required to characterize the facts stated, \r\n  or to give his cause of action a nameâ€¦.\" (emphasis added). \r\n  We hold the information presented in Glasscock's complaint is sufficient to \r\n  state a cause of action.\r\n\r\nII.  Substantive Reformation\r\n\r\n The main thrust of USF&amp;G's argument is that \r\n  the absence of statutory language mandating that property damages include loss \r\n  of use deprived the trial court of authority to reform the UIM endorsement to \r\n  include loss of use damages as property damages. We recognize there is no statutory \r\n  authority for including loss of use damages in the definition of property damages \r\n  in UIM endorsements. However, as USF&amp;G states in its brief, insurance companies \r\n  are free to offer coverage in excess of statutorily required coverage. Pennell \r\n  v. Foster, 338 S.C. 9, 20, 524 S.E.2d 630, 636 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"[A]n automobile \r\n  insurance policy can, by its language, provide greater coverage than the minimum \r\n  required by statute.\"). In its liability endorsement, USF&amp;G defined \"property \r\n  damage\" as including loss of use. By doing so, it chose to provide greater coverage \r\n  than the minimum required by statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 requires insurers to offer underinsured\r\n\r\n\r\nmotorist coverage up to the limits \r\n  of the insured's liability coverage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAutomobile insurance carriers shall offer â€¦ at the option of\r\nthe insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the\r\ninsured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event that\r\ndamages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an\r\nat-fault insured or underinsured motorist â€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n USF&amp;G argues the language, \"up to the limits \r\n  of the insured liability coverage,\" only applies to the dollar limit amounts \r\n  and not to the types of coverage offered in the liability and UIM coverages. \r\n  We addressed a similar issue in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company \r\n  v. Bookert, 330 S.C. 221, 499 S.E.2d 480 (Ct. App. 1997), rev'd on other grounds, \r\n  337 S.C. 291, 523 S.E.2d 181 (1999).\r\n\r\n In Bookert, the question arose whether the UIM \r\n  coverage of a policy should be reformed to include damages arising out of the \r\n  use of an automobile when the UIM endorsement only covered damages for ownership \r\n  and operation of a vehicle. The liability coverage contained in the policy covered \r\n  losses arising out of the ownership, operation, and use of a vehicle. In holding \r\n  that the UIM coverage did include damages arising out of the use of an automobile, \r\n  we stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Because underinsured motorist coverage is intended \r\n    to provide coverage where the at-fault driver's liability coverage is insufficient, \r\n    we conclude the legislature intended for underinsured motorist coverage to \r\n    provide the same type of coverage as liability coverage \r\n    â€¦. [I]t is logical to conclude underinsured motorist coverage should \r\n    provide the same spectrum of coverage as liability coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 229, 499 S.E.2d at 484 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n USF&amp;G suggests that Bookert should not apply \r\n  to this situation because in Bookert, there was statutory language mandating \r\n  that automobile policies cover losses arising out of the ownership, operation, \r\n  and use of a vehicle. We disagree. The clear unambiguous language of Bookert \r\n  interprets \"up to the limits of the insured liability coverage\" as contained \r\n  in Â§ 38-77-160 as requiring the insurer to provide the same type of coverage, \r\n  not just the same dollar limit. USF&amp;G chose to include loss of use damages \r\n  within property damages in its liability endorsement. Therefore, its UIM endorsement \r\n  also includes loss of use damages within its definition of property damage and \r\n  the trial court's reformation of the contract was proper.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\tFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court's decision is\r\n\r\n\t\tAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\t\tHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3414","title":"State v.

Charleston, for\r\nRespondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Duncan Proctor was convicted of four counts of first degree criminal sexual\r\nconduct (CSC) and one count of first degree burglary.  The trial court sentenced Proctor to life\r\nimprisonment for first degree burglary; one consecutive thirty year term as to one count of first\r\ndegree CSC; and three concurrent terms of thirty years on the remaining CSC convictions.  On\r\nappeal, Proctor argues the court erred in (1) denying Proctor's motion to have the proficiency\r\ntesting records of the DNA expert disclosed and (2) finding Proctor was competent to stand trial. \r\nWe affirm in part and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1991, Victim woke to find a mask-wearing intruder \r\n  standing in the doorway of her bedroom. The intruder grabbed her arm, held a \r\n  knife to her neck, and told her to remove her nightgown. The intruder led Victim \r\n  into one of the guest bedrooms where he repeatedly raped her at knife point. \r\n  Sometime during the attacks, the intruder removed his mask, placed it across \r\n  Victim's face, and warned her not to look at his face. He threatened to kill \r\n  her if she later called the police. The intruder entered Victim's home through \r\n  a window.\r\n\r\nWhile committing the criminal sexual conduct, the intruder \r\n  used a tube of K-Y Jelly. He cleansed himself with a lace doily and a wash cloth \r\n  during the attacks. Although Victim observed that her attacker had a slight \r\n  build, olive skin, and wavy dark hair, she did not see his face and could not \r\n  identify him.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 1992, an informant told the City of Charleston \r\n  Police Department that Proctor was involved in the criminal sexual conduct. \r\n  Proctor had olive skin, a slight build, and wavy dark brown hair. When the police \r\n  approached Proctor that day, Proctor sped away in his car and was involved in \r\n  a serious automobile accident. Proctor suffered massive brain damage and lost \r\n  the use of both his legs and his right arm. Proctor's brain injuries impaired \r\n  his ability to think, remember, and concentrate.\r\n\r\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis identified Proctor as the source of semen collected from\r\nVictim during the rape kit examination.  The fingerprint analysis performed on prints left on\r\nVictim's window screen and on the tube of K-Y Jelly indicated that Proctor was the source of the\r\nfingerprints.  The blood-type of the attacker, Group B secretor, and hair found at the scene were\r\nconsistent with that of Proctor.\r\n\r\nIn December 1992, Proctor was indicted on four counts of first degree CSC and one count of\r\nburglary in connection with the rape of Victim.  On May 26, 1993, the trial court found Proctor\r\nincompetent to stand trial.  When his competency was later reviewed, Proctor was declared\r\ncompetent to stand trial  pursuant to an order dated June 17, 1997.  Venue was transferred to\r\nOconee County.\r\n\r\nIn his DNA discovery request filed prior to trial, Proctor \r\n  requested the State turn over all internal and external proficiency tests and \r\n  all proficiency test results. Proctor submitted a memorandum in which he contended \r\n  the proficiency test results were discoverable under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and Brady \r\n  v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Proctor \r\n  maintained the proficiency test results would be used as evidence at trial, \r\n  the results were material to the defense, and the raw data to support them was \r\n  not confidential. Additionally, Proctor alleged that every laboratory makes \r\n  errors in performing DNA analysis. He presented copies of reports concerning \r\n  the proficiency test errors made at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) \r\n  lab and the lab's efforts to hide the errors.\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum in opposition to Proctor's discovery request, \r\n  the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) averred the test results \r\n  were not discoverable under either Rule 5 or Brady because Proctor could \r\n  not show how the proficiency test results were favorable or material. SLED argued \r\n  the test results were confidential, compiling the reports would be burdensome, \r\n  and the proficiency test results were not relevant to the evidence tested in \r\n  Proctor's case. SLED provided the affidavit of Ira Jeffcoat, the SLED agent \r\n  who performed the DNA analysis in Proctor's case. In his affidavit, Agent Jeffcoat \r\n  stated all SLED examiners had passed every proficiency test. He further declared \r\n  that revealing the results of all proficiency tests would be extremely burdensome \r\n  on SLED and would destroy the confidentiality of the testing process. The State \r\n  asserted it had no plans to introduce the proficiency test results in its case \r\n  in chief at trial.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court denied discovery of the DNA proficiency test results.  The trial\r\ncourt ruled the proficiency test results were not discoverable under Rule 5 because the State\r\nindicated it would not use the proficiency test results in its case in chief and the results did not\r\nrelate to any evidence in Proctor's case.  The court concluded the results were not material to the\r\npreparation of Proctor's defense.  The trial court found Proctor would be provided enough\r\ninformation regarding the DNA evidence for his expert witnesses to assess whether Agent Jeffcoat\r\nreached the correct conclusion.  The court noted Agent Jeffcoat's affidavit provided Proctor with\r\ninformation regarding the proficiency tests.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the trial court determined Proctor was not \r\n  entitled to the proficiency test results under Brady because Proctor \r\n  failed to show an initial basis for his claim that the results were material \r\n  and favorable to his defense and Proctor only offered unsupported speculations \r\n  that problems existed with SLED's proficiency testing. The court held the proficiency \r\n  test results were not relevant to the question of whether Agent Jeffcoat reached \r\n  the correct conclusions in Proctor's case. Finally, the court found that compiling \r\n  a proficiency testing report would be burdensome to SLED.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Agent Jeffcoat explained accreditation and proficiency testing.  In 1994, the SLED\r\nforensic laboratory became accredited.  The agency which determines SLED's accreditation status\r\nis the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD).  Agent Jeffcoat declared that\r\naccredited means \"our procedures in our lab have been inspected by an outside agency, that\r\nagency being the [ASCLD].\"  An important aspect of SLED's quality control program involves\r\nproficiency testing.\r\n\r\nAccording to Agent Jeffcoat, for the SLED forensic laboratory to maintain its accreditation status,\r\nthe ASCLD requires an outside agency to periodically inspect the SLED laboratory and conduct\r\nproficiency testing on every forensic examiner.  In a proficiency test, an examiner is given known\r\nand unknown DNA samples in order to determine if they match.  Each examiner is given two open\r\ntests a year, in which the examiner knows the samples are part of a proficiency test.  In addition,\r\nSLED examiners are given one blind proficiency test per year, where the examiners are not\r\ninformed the samples are part of a proficiency test and the samples are provided as if part of a\r\nnormal case.  The examiners receive a grade of either \"pass\" or \"fail.\"\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Did the trial court err in denying Proctor's motion to have the proficiency testing records of the\r\nDNA expert disclosed?\r\n\r\nII.  Did the trial court err in finding Proctor was competent to stand trial?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nDiscovery Orders\r\n\r\nAdverse orders regarding discovery may be reviewed on appeal \r\n  but they must be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion. See \r\n  State v. Newell, 303 S.C. 471, 401 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\nTrial Court's Finding of Competency to Stand Trial\r\n\r\nOn appeal, this Court will affirm a trial court's determination \r\n  of competency if it has evidentiary support and is not against the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  DNA Proficiency Test Records\r\n\r\n\r\nProctor argues the trial court erred in denying his motion \r\n  \"to have the proficiency testing records of the DNA expert disclosed.\" He asserts \r\n  the proficiency test results were discoverable under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and pursuant \r\n  to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\r\n\r\nThe admissibility of DNA evidence in a criminal trial is \r\n  a major event in regard to evidence against a defendant. The efficacy of DNA \r\n  evidence is recognized by all afficionados in the criminal trial venue. The \r\n  DNA expert conducting the analysis is a pivotal player in the laboratory activity. \r\n  In order to be an accredited laboratory for DNA purposes, the proficiency rate \r\n  of the DNA examiners is critical in analyzing the reliability of the testing \r\n  procedure. Accreditation of the laboratory is only allowed if outside monitoring \r\n  of the DNA examiners is done on the basis of blind and open proficiency tests. \r\n  The gravamen of the discovery request in the case sub judice  is the \r\n  production of the DNA proficiency rating by the outside laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn the novel and intriguing evidentiary issue presented in this case, we explore the cornucopia of\r\ndeveloping scientific knowledge as meshed with the precepts of due process.  The State distills\r\nfrom prior precedent that the defendant is only entitled to limited information in the DNA theater\r\nof operations.\r\n\r\nAgent Ira Jeffcoat filed an affidavit averring that all \r\n  SLED examiners had passed every proficiency test. Two documents which address \r\n  the issues concerning forensic DNA analysis and proficiency testing are the \r\n  National Research Council Report published in 1992 (NRC I) and a second report \r\n  published in 1996 (NRC II). Both documents agree that no laboratory has a zero \r\n  error rate. The NRC I provides: \"Laboratory error rates should be measured with \r\n  appropriate proficiency tests and should play a role in the interpretation of \r\n  results of forensic DNA typing. As discussed above, proficiency tests provide \r\n  a measure of the false-positive and false-negative rates of a laboratory. Even \r\n  in the best of laboratories, such rates are not zero.\" NRC I, p.94 (emphasis \r\n  added). The NRC II reads: \"It addresses determination of DNA profiles and considers \r\n  how laboratory errors (particularly false matches) can arise, how errors might \r\n  be reduced, and how to take into account the fact that the error rate can \r\n  never be reduced to zero.\" NRC II, back cover (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSLED takes the position that Agent\r\nJeffcoatâ€™s affidavit is sufficient. The French phrase &quot;pas du tout&quot;1\r\nis applicable. Are the court and defense counsel required to accept the\r\nself-serving assertion by the SLED examiner that he and the other DNA examiners\r\npassed all proficiency testing? Does the law allow any meaningful review of the\r\nbackground and qualification of a DNA examiner? Are all litigants in a DNA\r\nevidence scenario bound by the statement emanating from the DNA expert witness\r\nthat he or she passed all proficiency rating testing?\r\nA commonsensical analysis compels this Court to conclude\r\nthat a DNA expert, like all expert witnesses, is subject to scrutiny and query\r\nin regard to qualification and competency. Historically, this State has ruled\r\nthat the expertise, ability and acumen of an expert witness is relevant and\r\nessential. No citation of authority is needed for the well settled rule of\r\npractice and procedure that every expert witness is subject to voir dire\r\nexamination by the opposing party as to his or her qualifications before a final\r\nruling by the trial judge is made as to competency or incompetency of the\r\nproffered expert witness.\r\nA. Rule 5, SCRCrimP\r\n\r\nProctor argues the proficiency test results were\r\ndiscoverable pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP. We agree.\r\nThe requirements of Rule 5, as opposed to\r\nthe constitutional dictates of Brady, are judicially created discovery\r\nmechanisms for use in criminal proceedings. See State v. Kennerly, 331\r\nS.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d, 337 S.C. 617, 524\r\nS.E.2d 837 (1999). Rule 5 imposes different duties than Brady. Id. Rule\r\n5(a)(1)(D), SCRCrimP, provides:\r\n\r\n  Reports of Examinations and Tests. Upon\r\n  request of a defendant the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect\r\n  and copy any results or reports . . . of scientific tests or experiments, or\r\n  copies thereof, which are within the possession, custody, or control of the\r\n  prosecution, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due\r\n  diligence may become known, to the attorney for the prosecution, and which are\r\n  material to the preparation of the defense or are intended for use\r\n  by the prosecution as evidence in chief at the trial. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n&quot;The definition of â€˜materialâ€™ for\r\npurposes of Rule 5 is the same as the definition used in the Brady\r\ncontext.&quot; Kennerly, 331 S.C. at 453, 503 S.E.2d at 220. Evidence is\r\n&quot;material&quot; under Brady only if there is a reasonable\r\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding\r\nwould have been different. State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d\r\n689 (1996). Once a Rule 5 violation is shown, reversal is required only where\r\nthe defendant suffered prejudice from the violation. State v. Trotter,\r\n322 S.C. 537, 473 S.E.2d 452 (1996); Kennerly, 331 S.C. at 453-54, 503\r\nS.E.2d at 220.\r\nThe proficiency test results could very\r\nwell be material to the preparation of Proctorâ€™s defense. All proficiency test\r\nresults of the DNA analyst involved in the case must be produced. Defense\r\ncounsel has the right to cross examine the DNA analyst regarding his or her\r\nperformance on proficiency tests. A failing grade by the DNA analyst on his or\r\nher proficiency tests is clearly relevant in the judgeâ€™s evaluation of the\r\nexpertâ€™s competency and most probably reflects negatively on the reliability\r\nof the DNA evidence introduced at trial. The trial court abused its discretion\r\nin denying discovery of the proficiency test results pursuant to Rule 5.\r\nAs to the second prong of Rule 5, the State asserted prior to trial that it had no plans to introduce\r\nthe proficiency test results in its case in chief at trial.  During direct examination of Agent Jeffcoat\r\nat trial, the State questioned him about the SLED laboratory's qualifications to perform DNA\r\nanalysis.  In describing SLED's quality control program, Agent Jeffcoat testified regarding\r\nproficiency testing.  When instructed by the State to \"let the jury know how you are doing on your\r\nproficiency test,\" Agent Jeffcoat responded: \"In every occasion where we have been provided\r\nproficiency tests, we've always called the correct match.\"  Defense counsel objected stating,\r\n\"Your Honor, at this point I renew my objection and ask to be allowed to see the underlying data\r\nof those proficiency tests.\"  The judge ruled:  \"That's noted for the record and denied on the same\r\nbasis as before.\"  Thereafter, Agent Jeffcoat declared: \"In all cases in which we have received\r\nproficiency tests, we have always made the correct match.  We've always matched the donor\r\nevidence with the donor in all cases that we've been tested.\"\r\n\r\nA veracious review of the trial testimony leads to the ineluctable conclusion that the State did in\r\nfact use the examinations and tests in the State's evidence in chief at the trial.  Agent Jeffcoat\r\ntestified with exactitude in reference to the proficiency test results and the acumen possessed by\r\nthe DNA SLED examiners.\r\n\r\nB. Brady v. Maryland \r\n\r\nProctor asserts he was entitled to the proficiency test \r\n  results pursuant to Brady because he needed the test results for impeachment \r\n  purposes. We agree.\r\n\r\nCompliance with Brady is a constitutional requirement. \r\n  See State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 (Ct. App. 1998), \r\n  aff'd, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999). The Brady disclosure rule \r\n  is grounded in the defendant's fundamental right to a fair trial mandated by \r\n  the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Id.\r\n\r\nBrady requires the prosecution to disclose evidence \r\n  which is favorable to a defendant and material to guilt or punishment. This \r\n  applies to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence. United States \r\n  v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); State \r\n  v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996). Evidence is \"material\" \r\n  under Brady only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence \r\n  been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been \r\n  different. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  494; State v. Cain, 297 S.C. 497, 377 S.E.2d 556 (1988). A \"reasonable \r\n  probability\" is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. \r\n  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d at 494; State \r\n  v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998). Reversal of a conviction \r\n  is required only if the undisclosed evidence is material and the omission deprived \r\n  the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  517 (Ct. App. 1996); State v. Freeman, 319 S.C. 110, 459 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Bryant, 307 S.C. 458, 415 S.E.2d 806 \r\n  (1992), our Supreme Court discussed the materiality prong of Brady:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he State must produce undisclosed evidence for the trial \r\n    judge's inspection once a defendant has established a basis for his claim \r\n    that it contains material exculpatory or impeachment evidence. The trial \r\n    judge should then rule upon the materiality of the evidence to determine whether \r\n    the State must produce it for the defendant's use.\r\n\r\n\r\nBryant, 307 S.C. at 461-62, 415 S.E.2d at 808-09 \r\n  (emphasis added)(citing Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. \r\n  989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987)).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the undisclosed proficiency test results \r\n  could very well be material to Proctor's case for impeachment and important \r\n  for cross-examination purposes. SLED's contention that compiling the reports \r\n  would be burdensome has no merit. After the tests were completed, the outside \r\n  laboratory compiled the data and turned it over to SLED. We find the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in refusing to order disclosure of the proficiency test \r\n  results pursuant to Brady.\r\n\r\nC.  Other Jurisdictions\r\n\r\nIn some jurisdictions, a defendant is provided the underlying \r\n  proficiency test results in discovery. See Hodges v. Commonwealth, 492 \r\n  S.E.2d 846 (Va. Ct. App. 1997)(where the trial court ordered discovery of the \r\n  proficiency test data and the parties agreed the lab would provide a memorandum \r\n  recounting the proficiency testing of a particular examiner, the trial court \r\n  correctly exercised its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for further \r\n  discovery regarding the underlying details of the test results); Keen v. \r\n  Commonwealth, 485 S.E.2d 659 (Va. Ct. App. 1997)(although the appellate \r\n  court presumed that the trial court erred in refusing to allow discovery of \r\n  the underlying proficiency test results, the error was deemed harmless in light \r\n  of the other evidence presented at trial).\r\n\r\nAcademically and fundamentally, the issue has been dissected into relevant and consequential\r\nquery to be used at trial before the fact finder.  A review of cases in other jurisdictions reveals a\r\nplethora of issues raised relating to DNA proficiency tests:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is the laboratory error rate relevant in the calculation of the overall odds claimed by the DNA\r\nanalyst?\r\n  Is the proficiency test data relevant to the credibility of the DNA evidence?\r\n  Should the jury be allowed to consider proficiency test results/records along with the DNA\r\nmatching data?\r\n  Does the DNA examiner's performance on the proficiency tests go to the weight of the DNA\r\nevidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee, e.g., State v. Tankersley, 956 \r\n  P.2d 486 (Ariz. 1998)(determining that if procedures implementing a scientifically \r\n  accepted testing principle are so seriously flawed that results are rendered \r\n  unreliable, trial court should not admit the evidence, but once adequate foundation \r\n  is established, complaints of laboratory error or incompetence are considered \r\n  by trier of fact in assessing weight of evidence); Commonwealth v. Teixeira, \r\n  662 N.E.2d 726 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996)(explaining weaknesses in laboratory's proficiency \r\n  testing go to weight to be ascribed to evidence of DNA match, not to its admissibility); \r\n  State v. Moore, 885 P.2d 457 (Mont. 1994), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Gollehon, 906 P.2d 697 (Mont. 1995)(finding challenge to proficiency \r\n  testing of DNA expert goes to weight of evidence, not its admissibility; even \r\n  if error rate of expert's proficiency tests presented challenge to reliability \r\n  of polymerase chain reaction analysis, that argument would not result in exclusion \r\n  of PCR evidence, as error rate would only be one factor considered in determining \r\n  admissibility); Keen v. Commonwealth, 485 S.E.2d 659 (Va. Ct. App. 1997)(concluding \r\n  that even if the proficiency test results of expert had been admitted and could \r\n  have been used by Keen to establish state laboratory had previously made erroneous \r\n  findings, this information would not have affected admissibility of the DNA \r\n  evidence, but rather, would have only affected the weight the fact finder accorded \r\n  the DNA evidence); State v. Copeland, 922 P.2d 1304 (Wash. 1996)(holding \r\n  that laboratory error is a matter of weight and not admissibility under Frye \r\n  v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923); under Rule of Evidence 702, \r\n  if lab error or error rates are so serious that results are not helpful to the \r\n  jury, the trial court may in its discretion rule the evidence inadmissible); \r\n  State v. Cauthron, 846 P.2d 502, 512 (Wash. 1993)(noting that thorough \r\n  cross-examination of State's experts on possibility of error in laboratory and \r\n  errors in proficiency tests allowed jury to get \"a balanced picture\" of the \r\n  DNA evidence); National Research Council, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA \r\n  Evidence (1996)(stating proficiency testing bears on weight that should \r\n  be accorded forensic test results).\r\n\r\nD.  Harmless Error\r\n\r\nThe State maintains that, even if the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying disclosure of the proficiency test results under Rule 5 or Brady, \r\n  such error is harmless. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge in the instant case erred in denying disclosure \r\n  of the proficiency test results under Rule 5 and Brady. Clearly, the \r\n  error was not harmless. Ignoring the DNA evidence presented at trial, \r\n  there was substantial disputation of evidence regarding guilt. The record does \r\n  not disclose overwhelming evidence to support Proctor's conviction in the absence \r\n  of the DNA evidence. We hold there is a reasonable probability that the disclosure \r\n  of SLED's proficiency test results would reasonably have affected the outcome \r\n  of the trial. See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  150 (1985)(error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the \r\n  result of the trial).\r\n\r\nII.  Competency\r\n\r\n\r\nProctor contends the trial court erred in finding him competent to stand trial.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nA trial court's determination of competency will be upheld \r\n  on review if it has evidentiary support and is not against the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996). \r\n  \"The test for competency to stand trial or continue trial is whether the defendant \r\n  has the sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable \r\n  degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational, as well as a \r\n  factual, understanding of the proceedings against him.\" State v. Bell, \r\n  293 S.C. 391, 395-96, 360 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1987)(citing Dusky v. United States, \r\n  362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)). The defendant bears the burden \r\n  of proving his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. Nance, \r\n  320 S.C. at 504, 466 S.E.2d at 351; State v. Lee, 274 S.C. 372, 264 S.E.2d \r\n  418 (1980).\r\n\r\nProctor was found incompetent to stand trial in 1993.  The State moved to have Proctor re-evaluated in 1996.  A competency hearing was held in May 1997.\r\n\r\nDr. Jeffrey R. McKee, a forensic psychologist, and Dr. Donald Morgan, a forensic psychiatrist,\r\nevaluated Proctor to determine competency.  During those evaluations, Proctor stated that he faced\r\ncharges of \"rape,\" breaking and entering, and assault.  Proctor indicated he understood (1) the\r\nnature of the competency hearing; (2) that he could be found guilty and sentenced to prison at\r\ntrial; and (3) that his attorney's role was to prove him not guilty and to consult with Proctor before\r\nProctor answered certain questions.\r\n\r\nDr. McKee declared that, although Proctor suffered a deficit in his short term memory and could\r\nnot name his attorneys, he could recall new information and gain an understanding of judicial\r\nproceedings if prompted by his attorney or given a summary of the proceedings.  Dr. Donald\r\nMorgan testified Proctor was competent to stand trial, understood the charges against him and the\r\nnature of the proceedings, and was able to consult with his attorneys, in spite of Proctor's severe\r\nbrain damage.  Dr. Morgan opined that, despite Proctor's amnesia of events surrounding the time\r\nperiod of the rapes, he could assist in his defense to the extent that he could discuss witness\r\ntestimony at trial and evaluate legal options.  Despite Proctor's severe brain damage and memory\r\ndeficits, both physicians found Proctor competent to stand trial.\r\n\r\nDr. Harold Morgan, a forensic psychiatrist, stated Proctor was not competent to stand trial.  He\r\nbelieved Proctor had a factual understanding of the charges against him, but could not adequately\r\nconsult with his attorneys because he could not recall the discussions.  Dr. Morgan noted that,\r\nalthough Proctor could learn some things by repetition, Proctor could not recall names and could\r\nnot recall information after any amount of time passed.  He found Proctor would need a lot of\r\nassistance from his attorneys during a trial because Proctor lost things from his memory very\r\nquickly and did not have the \"very kind of memory he needs for assisting his attorneys and\r\ncompetently participating in his trial.\"  According to Dr. Morgan, Proctor's attorneys would have\r\nto constantly go over the events of each day during trial, including the events of the previous days,\r\nin order for Proctor to try to understand the proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1997, the trial court issued an order finding Proctor competent to stand trial.  The\r\ncourt stated Proctor conceded he had a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.  In\r\nevaluating Proctor's ability to assist his attorneys, the trial court determined Proctor could\r\ncommunicate with his attorneys and Proctor's memory deficits could be corrected through reviews\r\nwith his attorneys.  The trial judge further noted his personal observations that Proctor was\r\nattentive, reacted appropriately, and consulted with his attorneys throughout the competency\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nAnother competency hearing was held immediately preceding Proctor's March 1998 trial.  Dr.\r\nHarold Morgan testified Proctor suffered from severe memory deficits and could not retain new\r\ninformation.  According to Dr. Morgan, Proctor would not be able to follow highly complicated\r\ntestimony, such as DNA testimony, nor would he be able to comprehend or retain information\r\nabout the process of plea negotiations for a long period of time.  Although Proctor indicated he\r\nunderstood he had a right to trial, Dr. Morgan opined that Proctor could not assist his attorneys in\r\nthe preparation of his defense.  Dr. Morgan confirmed his opinion from the prior competency\r\nproceeding that Proctor was not competent to stand trial.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas William Behrmann, a psychiatrist, testified for the State regarding Proctor's\r\ncompetency.  After reviewing the records from Proctor's prior competency evaluations and\r\nmeeting with Proctor three times, Dr. Behrmann concluded Proctor was competent to stand trial. \r\nDr. Behrmann based his finding on Proctor's ability to understand the charges against him,\r\nappreciate the seriousness of those charges, comprehend the adversarial process, and interact with\r\ndefense counsel in a helpful manner.  Dr. Behrmann believed Proctor's ability to communicate\r\nwith his attorneys had improved over time.  At the end of Dr. Behrmann's testimony, Proctor's\r\ncounsel informed the trial court that Proctor told her he did not meet with Dr. Behrmann three\r\ntimes nor did he understand what he was testifying about.\r\n\r\nProctor testified at the competency hearing.  Proctor could not recall the names of the two\r\nphysicians who had testified prior to him.  He could not remember jury selection or anything said\r\nabout the legal process.\r\n\r\nThe trial court affirmed its prior finding that Proctor was competent to stand trial.  The trial court\r\nnoted Proctor's ability to recall appeared to improve.  The trial court observed Proctor \"does have\r\nrecollection of this process and has been here all day,\" responded to questions asked of him, and\r\nappeared able to assist his attorneys.\r\n\r\nDuring breaks in testimony throughout the trial, Proctor's counsel informed the court when\r\nProctor would indicate to counsel that he did not understand something or when Proctor could not\r\nrecall the events of the day.\r\n\r\nProctor concedes he had a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.  He contends the\r\ntrial court erred in finding him competent to stand trial because his memory deficits rendered him\r\nunable to rationally assist his attorneys with the defense.  Although there was evidence that\r\nProctor was unable to recall some information unless it was constantly repeated, Proctor did not\r\nmeet his burden of proving he was unable to assist his attorneys.  Proctor understood the nature of\r\nthe charges against him, the seriousness of the charges, and the adversarial nature of the\r\nproceedings.  He consulted his attorneys when he had questions.  Despite Proctor's amnesia\r\nregarding the events surrounding the crime, he was able to rationally discuss the trial proceedings\r\nwith counsel and comprehend them.\r\n\r\nWe conclude there was ample evidence to support the trial court's finding that Proctor was\r\ncompetent to stand trial.  Further, the trial judge's determination of competency is not against the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the trial judge did not err in finding Proctor competent to stand trial.  The State's\r\nevidence reveals that Proctor has the sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a\r\nreasonable degree of rational understanding and Proctor possesses a rational, as well as a factual,\r\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the trial court erred in denying Proctor's motion \r\n  to have the proficiency test records of the DNA expert disclosed. We hold that, \r\n  pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. \r\n  1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), a defendant is entitled to the pre-trial production \r\n  of DNA proficiency test records of the SLED DNA expert. We bifurcate the mandate \r\n  of production:\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  outside laboratory proficiency tests and records and\r\n\r\n2)  SLED laboratory proficiency tests and records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the outside laboratory proficiency tests and records \r\n  done in the accreditation process, we order the pre-trial production of all \r\n  records of proficiency testing of personnel in the laboratories where Restriction \r\n  Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analyses, \r\n  the two types of DNA testing procedures, are performed in the case and records \r\n  of laboratory error rates resulting from external blind forensic DNA analyses \r\n  or any other studies pertaining to error rates.\r\n\r\nAs to the SLED laboratory proficiency tests and records, \r\n  we limit the production to the results of proficiency testing of personnel \r\n  and the results of laboratory error rates resulting from internal blind \r\n  forensic DNA analyses or any other studies pertaining to error rates.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we remand the case to the Charleston County \r\n  Court of General Sessions and direct that an in camera Bryant \r\n  hearing be held to determine whether the records and information produced are \r\n  material to the defendant's case. If the Circuit Court Judge \r\n  (2) concludes the records and information are material, the judge \r\n  shall order a new trial. If the records and information are not material, the \r\n  Circuit Judge shall affirm the convictions of Duncan R. Proctor.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n1. Not at all, not so.\r\n\r\n2.

The trial court sentenced Proctor to life imprisonment for first\r\ndegree burglary; one consecutive thirty year term for first degree CSC; one concurrent term of five\r\nyears for AWIK; and one concurrent term of one year for possession of a firearm.  On appeal,\r\nProctor argues the court erred in (1) denying Proctor's motion to have the proficiency testing\r\nrecords of the DNA expert disclosed and (2) finding Proctor was competent to stand trial.  We\r\naffirm in part and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 1991, Victim was awakened early in the morning when an intruder sat on her and\r\nforced her arms over her head.  The intruder placed a silver or light-colored gun to Victim's head,\r\nhit her head on the bed, and threatened to kill her if she did not remain quiet.  The intruder pulled\r\nthe trigger of the gun several times.\r\n\r\nHolding her neck, the intruder forced Victim downstairs to the living room where he repeatedly\r\nraped her.  Several outside lights shined into Victim's windows, and she could see her attacker's\r\nface and complexion.  During the attacks, the intruder mentioned Victim's daughter by name and\r\nthreatened to kill her daughter if Victim told anyone about the rape.  Victim was unable to call for\r\nhelp after the intruder left because the cords on all three of her telephones had been cut.\r\n\r\nVictim was taken to a hospital for evaluation and a rape kit was performed.  Evidence collected at\r\nthe hospital included Victim's gown, unknown pubic hairs, and semen.  Material identified at the\r\ncrime scene included semen on the carpet and the couch, fingerprints, and a shoe imprint outside\r\nthe apartment.  Victim met with a police sketch artist, who drew a composite of Victim's attacker\r\nbased on her description.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 1992, the City of North Charleston Police Department received information which led\r\nto the surveillance of Proctor.  When police approached him that day, Proctor sped away in his car\r\nand led police on a high-speed chase.  Proctor was involved in a serious automobile accident,\r\nsuffering severe injuries to his head, both legs, and his right arm.  A silver gun was retrieved from\r\nProctor's car at the scene of the accident.\r\n\r\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis identified Proctor as the source of semen collected during\r\nthe rape kit examination.  The pubic hair found on Victim was consistent with Proctor's pubic\r\nhair.  Proctor's blood type was consistent with that of Victim's attacker.  None of the fingerprints\r\ncollected from the scene matched Proctor's fingerprints.  The shoe imprint taken from outside\r\nVictim's apartment did not match shoes owned by Proctor.\r\n\r\nProctor was indicted in Dorchester County for first degree burglary, first degree CSC, AWIK, and\r\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  Venue was transferred to\r\nCherokee County.\r\n\r\nIn his DNA discovery request filed prior to trial, Proctor \r\n  requested the State turn over all internal and external proficiency tests and \r\n  all proficiency test results. Proctor submitted a memorandum in which he contended \r\n  the proficiency test results were discoverable under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and Brady \r\n  v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Proctor \r\n  maintained the proficiency test results would be used as evidence at trial, \r\n  the results were material to the defense, and the raw data to support them was \r\n  not confidential. Additionally, Proctor alleged that every laboratory makes \r\n  errors in performing DNA analysis. He presented copies of reports concerning \r\n  the proficiency test errors made at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) \r\n  lab and the lab's efforts to hide the errors.\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum in opposition to Proctor's discovery request, \r\n  the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) averred the test results \r\n  were not discoverable under either Rule 5 or Brady because Proctor could \r\n  not show how the proficiency test results were favorable or material. SLED argued \r\n  the test results were confidential, compiling the reports would be burdensome, \r\n  and the proficiency test results were not relevant to the evidence tested in \r\n  Proctor's case. SLED provided the affidavit of Ira Jeffcoat, the SLED agent \r\n  who performed the DNA analysis in Proctor's case. In his affidavit, Agent Jeffcoat \r\n  stated all SLED examiners had passed every proficiency test. He further declared \r\n  that revealing the results of all proficiency tests would be extremely burdensome \r\n  on SLED and would destroy the confidentiality of the testing process. The State \r\n  asserted it had no plans to introduce the proficiency test results in its case \r\n  in chief at trial.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court denied discovery of the DNA proficiency test results.  The trial\r\ncourt ruled the proficiency test results were not discoverable under Rule 5 because the State\r\nindicated it would not use the proficiency test results in its case in chief and the results did not\r\nrelate to any evidence in Proctor's case.  The court concluded the results were not material to the\r\npreparation of Proctor's defense.  The trial court found Proctor would be provided enough\r\ninformation regarding the DNA evidence for his expert witnesses to assess whether Agent Jeffcoat\r\nreached the correct conclusion.  The court noted Agent Jeffcoat's affidavit provided Proctor with\r\ninformation regarding the proficiency tests.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the trial court determined Proctor was not \r\n  entitled to the proficiency test results under Brady because Proctor \r\n  failed to show an initial basis for his claim that the results were material \r\n  and favorable to his defense and Proctor only offered unsupported speculations \r\n  that problems existed with SLED's proficiency testing. The court held the proficiency \r\n  test results were not relevant to the question of whether Agent Jeffcoat reached \r\n  the correct conclusions in Proctor's case. Finally, the court found that compiling \r\n  a proficiency testing report would be burdensome to SLED.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Victim positively identified Proctor as her attacker.  She testified the gun found in\r\nProctor's car was similar in size and color to the one used in her attack.\r\n\r\nAgent Jeffcoat explained accreditation and proficiency testing.  In 1994, the SLED forensic\r\nlaboratory became accredited.  The agency which determines SLED's accreditation status is the\r\nAmerican Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD).  Agent Jeffcoat declared that\r\naccreditation means \"you have accepted . . . a set of standards that you want your lab to adhere to. \r\nThose standards include things such as protocol and a protocol validation, quality control\r\nmeasures, guidelines on the qualifications for your employees, validation procedures for each new\r\ntest that you bring on line.  Different aspects of setting up a lab.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Agent Jeffcoat, for the SLED forensic laboratory to maintain its accreditation status,\r\nthe ASCLD requires an outside agency to periodically inspect the SLED laboratory and conduct\r\nproficiency testing on every forensic examiner.  In a proficiency test, an examiner is given known\r\nand unknown DNA samples in order to determine if they match.  Each examiner is given two open\r\ntests a year, in which the examiner knows the samples are part of a proficiency test.  In addition,\r\nSLED examiners are given one blind proficiency test per year, where the examiners are not\r\ninformed the samples are part of a proficiency test and the samples are provided as if part of a\r\nnormal case.  The examiners receive a grade of either \"pass\" or \"fail.\"\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Did the trial court err in denying Proctor's motion to have the proficiency testing records of the\r\nDNA expert disclosed?\r\n\r\nII.  Did the trial court err in finding Proctor was competent to stand trial?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nDiscovery Orders\r\n\r\nAdverse orders regarding discovery may be reviewed on appeal \r\n  but they must be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion. See \r\n  State v. Newell, 303 S.C. 471, 401 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\nTrial Court's Finding of Competency to Stand Trial\r\n\r\nOn appeal, this Court will affirm a trial court's determination \r\n  of competency if it has evidentiary support and is not against the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  DNA Proficiency Test Records\r\n\r\n\r\nProctor argues the trial court erred in denying his motion \r\n  \"to have the proficiency testing records of the DNA expert disclosed.\" He asserts \r\n  the proficiency test results were discoverable under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and pursuant \r\n  to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\r\n\r\nThe admissibility of DNA evidence in a criminal trial is \r\n  a major event in regard to evidence against a defendant. The efficacy of DNA \r\n  evidence is recognized by all afficionados in the criminal trial venue. The \r\n  DNA expert conducting the analysis is a pivotal player in the laboratory activity. \r\n  In order to be an accredited laboratory for DNA purposes, the proficiency rate \r\n  of the DNA examiners is critical in analyzing the reliability of the testing \r\n  procedure. Accreditation of the laboratory is only allowed if outside monitoring \r\n  of the DNA examiners is done on the basis of blind and open proficiency tests. \r\n  The gravamen of the discovery request in the case sub judice is \r\n  the production of the DNA proficiency rating by the outside laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn the novel and intriguing evidentiary issue presented in this case, we explore the cornucopia of\r\ndeveloping scientific knowledge as meshed with the precepts of due process.  The State distills\r\nfrom prior precedent that the defendant is only entitled to limited information in the DNA theater\r\nof operations.\r\n\r\nAgent Ira Jeffcoat filed an affidavit averring that all \r\n  SLED examiners had passed every proficiency test. Two documents which address \r\n  the issues concerning forensic DNA analysis and proficiency testing are the \r\n  National Research Council Report published in 1992 (NRC I) and a second report \r\n  published in 1996 (NRC II). Both documents agree that no laboratory has a zero \r\n  error rate. The NRC I provides: \"Laboratory error rates should be measured with \r\n  appropriate proficiency tests and should play a role in the interpretation of \r\n  results of forensic DNA typing. As discussed above, proficiency tests provide \r\n  a measure of the false-positive and false-negative rates of a laboratory. Even \r\n  in the best of laboratories, such rates are not zero.\" NRC I, p.94 (emphasis \r\n  added). The NRC II reads: \"It addresses determination of DNA profiles and considers \r\n  how laboratory errors (particularly false matches) can arise, how errors might \r\n  be reduced, and how to take into account the fact that the error rate can \r\n  never be reduced to zero.\" NRC II, back cover (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSLED takes the position that Agent Jeffcoat's affidavit is sufficient.  The French phrase \"pas du\r\ntout\" (1) is applicable.  Are the court and defense counsel required to accept the self-serving\r\nassertion by the SLED examiner that he and the other DNA examiners passed all proficiency\r\ntesting?  Does the law allow any meaningful review of the background and qualification of a DNA\r\nexaminer?  Are all litigants in a DNA evidence scenario bound by the statement emanating from\r\nthe DNA expert witness that he or she passed all proficiency rating testing?\r\n\r\nA commonsensical analysis compels this Court to conclude \r\n  that a DNA expert, like all expert witnesses, is subject to scrutiny and query \r\n  in regard to qualification and competency. Historically, this State has ruled \r\n  that the expertise, ability and acumen of an expert witness is relevant and \r\n  essential. No citation of authority is needed for the well settled rule of practice \r\n  and procedure that every expert witness is subject to voir dire examination \r\n  by the opposing party as to his or her qualifications before a final ruling \r\n  by the trial judge is made as to competency or incompetency of the proffered \r\n  expert witness.\r\n\r\nA.  Rule 5, SCRCrimP\r\n\r\nProctor argues the proficiency test results were discoverable pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP.  We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of Rule 5, as opposed to the constitutional \r\n  dictates of Brady, are judicially created discovery mechanisms for use \r\n  in criminal proceedings. See State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 214 (Ct. App. 1998), aff'd, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999). \r\n  Rule 5 imposes different duties than Brady. Id. Rule 5(a)(1)(D), \r\n  SCRCrimP, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reports of Examinations and Tests. Upon request of a defendant \r\n    the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy any results \r\n    or reports . . . of scientific tests or experiments, or copies thereof, which \r\n    are within the possession, custody, or control of the prosecution, the existence \r\n    of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to \r\n    the attorney for the prosecution, and which are material to the preparation \r\n    of the defense or are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence \r\n    in chief at the trial. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The definition of 'material' for purposes of Rule 5 is \r\n  the same as the definition used in the Brady context.\" Kennerly, \r\n  331 S.C. at 453, 503 S.E.2d at 220. Evidence is \"material\" under Brady \r\n  only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, \r\n  the result of the proceeding would have been different. State v. Von Dohlen, \r\n  322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996). Once a Rule 5 violation is shown, reversal \r\n  is required only where the defendant suffered prejudice from the violation. \r\n  State v. Trotter, 322 S.C. 537, 473 S.E.2d 452 (1996); Kennerly, \r\n  331 S.C. at 453-54, 503 S.E.2d at 220.\r\n\r\nThe proficiency test results could very well be material to the preparation of Proctor's defense. \r\nAll proficiency test results of the DNA analyst involved in the case must be produced.  Defense\r\ncounsel has the right to cross examine the DNA analyst regarding his or her performance on\r\nproficiency tests.  A failing grade by the DNA analyst on his or her proficiency tests is clearly\r\nrelevant in the judge's evaluation of the expert's competency and most probably reflects\r\nnegatively on the reliability of the DNA evidence introduced at trial.  The trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in denying discovery of the proficiency test results pursuant to Rule 5.\r\n\r\nAs to the second prong of Rule 5, the State asserted prior to trial that it had no plans to introduce\r\nthe proficiency test results in its case in chief at trial.  During direct examination of Agent\r\nJeffcoat, the State questioned him about the SLED laboratory's qualifications to perform DNA\r\nanalysis.  In describing SLED's quality control program, Agent Jeffcoat testified regarding\r\nproficiency testing.  Thereafter, when asked by the State whether there was a \"stated error rate\" at\r\n\"the SLED lab DNA station,\" Agent Jeffcoat answered: \"[E]rror rate is, I guess, would be\r\nsomething, a form that you would apply some numbers to and come up with an overall error rate. \r\nWe have never done that, developed an error rate.  To answer your question, I mean, we have-we\r\nhave been given proficiencies since 1991.\"  Defense counsel objected stating, \"Your Honor, we\r\nmade a pretrial motion about being able to confront this piece of evidence, and we would move to\r\nexclude this part of the testimony.\"  The judge sustained the objection.  Although the State elicited\r\ntestimony regarding proficiency testing, the State did not present the actual test results as part of\r\nits evidence in chief at trial.  Further, Agent Jeffcoat did not discuss the results of the proficiency\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nB. Brady v. Maryland \r\n\r\nProctor asserts he was entitled to the proficiency test \r\n  results pursuant to Brady because he needed the test results for impeachment \r\n  purposes. We agree.\r\n\r\nCompliance with Brady is a constitutional requirement. \r\n  See State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998), aff'd, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999). The Brady disclosure \r\n  rule is grounded in the defendant's fundamental right to a fair trial mandated \r\n  by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Id.\r\n\r\nBrady requires the prosecution to disclose evidence \r\n  which is favorable to a defendant and material to guilt or punishment. This \r\n  applies to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence. United States \r\n  v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); State \r\n  v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996). Evidence is \"material\" \r\n  under Brady only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence \r\n  been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been \r\n  different. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  494; State v. Cain, 297 S.C. 497, 377 S.E.2d 556 (1988). A \"reasonable \r\n  probability\" is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. \r\n  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d at 494; State \r\n  v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998). Reversal of a conviction \r\n  is required only if the undisclosed evidence is material and the omission deprived \r\n  the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  517 (Ct. App. 1996); State v. Freeman, 319 S.C. 110, 459 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Bryant, 307 S.C. 458, 415 S.E.2d 806 \r\n  (1992), our Supreme Court discussed the materiality prong of Brady:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he State must produce undisclosed evidence for the trial \r\n    judge's inspection once a defendant has established a basis for his claim \r\n    that it contains material exculpatory or impeachment evidence. The trial \r\n    judge should then rule upon the materiality of the evidence to determine whether \r\n    the State must produce it for the defendant's use.\r\n\r\n\r\nBryant, 307 S.C. at 461-62, 415 S.E.2d at 808-09 \r\n  (emphasis added)(citing Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. \r\n  989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987)).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the undisclosed proficiency test results \r\n  could very well be material to Proctor's case for impeachment and important \r\n  for cross-examination purposes. SLED's contention that compiling the reports \r\n  would be burdensome has no merit. After the tests were completed, the outside \r\n  laboratory compiled the data and turned it over to SLED. We find the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in refusing to order disclosure of the proficiency test \r\n  results pursuant to Brady.\r\n\r\nC.  Other Jurisdictions\r\n\r\nIn some jurisdictions, a defendant is provided the underlying \r\n  proficiency test results in discovery. See Hodges v. Commonwealth, \r\n  492 S.E.2d 846 (Va. Ct. App. 1997)(where the trial court ordered discovery of \r\n  the proficiency test data and the parties agreed the lab would provide a memorandum \r\n  recounting the proficiency testing of a particular examiner, the trial court \r\n  correctly exercised its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for further \r\n  discovery regarding the underlying details of the test results); Keen v. \r\n  Commonwealth, 485 S.E.2d 659 (Va. Ct. App. 1997)(although the appellate \r\n  court presumed that the trial court erred in refusing to allow discovery of \r\n  the underlying proficiency test results, the error was deemed harmless in light \r\n  of the other evidence presented at trial).\r\n\r\nAcademically and fundamentally, the issue has been dissected into relevant and consequential\r\nquery to be used at trial before the fact finder.  A review of cases in other jurisdictions reveals a\r\nplethora of issues raised relating to DNA proficiency tests:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is the laboratory error rate relevant in the calculation of the overall odds claimed by the DNA\r\nanalyst?\r\n  Is the proficiency test data relevant to the credibility of the DNA evidence?\r\n  Should the jury be allowed to consider proficiency test results/records along with the DNA\r\nmatching data?\r\n  Does the DNA examiner's performance on the proficiency tests go to the weight of the DNA\r\nevidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee, e.g., State v. Tankersley, 956 \r\n  P.2d 486 (Ariz. 1998)(determining that if procedures implementing a scientifically \r\n  accepted testing principle are so seriously flawed that results are rendered \r\n  unreliable, trial court should not admit the evidence, but once adequate foundation \r\n  is established, complaints of laboratory error or incompetence are considered \r\n  by trier of fact in assessing weight of evidence); Commonwealth v. Teixeira, \r\n  662 N.E.2d 726 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996)(explaining weaknesses in laboratory's proficiency \r\n  testing go to weight to be ascribed to evidence of DNA match, not to its admissibility); \r\n  State v. Moore, 885 P.2d 457 (Mont. 1994), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Gollehon, 906 P.2d 697 (Mont. 1995)(finding challenge to proficiency \r\n  testing of DNA expert goes to weight of evidence, not its admissibility; even \r\n  if error rate of expert's proficiency tests presented challenge to reliability \r\n  of polymerase chain reaction analysis, that argument would not result in exclusion \r\n  of PCR evidence, as error rate would only be one factor considered in determining \r\n  admissibility); Keen v. Commonwealth, 485 S.E.2d 659 (Va. Ct. App. 1997)(concluding \r\n  that even if the proficiency test results of expert had been admitted and could \r\n  have been used by Keen to establish state laboratory had previously made erroneous \r\n  findings, this information would not have affected admissibility of the DNA \r\n  evidence, but rather, would have only affected the weight the fact finder accorded \r\n  the DNA evidence); State v. Copeland, 922 P.2d 1304 (Wash. 1996)(holding \r\n  that laboratory error is a matter of weight and not admissibility under Frye \r\n  v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923); under Rule of Evidence 702, \r\n  if lab error or error rates are so serious that results are not helpful to the \r\n  jury, the trial court may in its discretion rule the evidence inadmissible); \r\n  State v. Cauthron, 846 P.2d 502, 512 (Wash. 1993)(noting that thorough \r\n  cross-examination of State's experts on possibility of error in laboratory and \r\n  errors in proficiency tests allowed jury to get \"a balanced picture\" of the \r\n  DNA evidence); National Research Council, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA \r\n  Evidence (1996)(stating proficiency testing bears on weight that should \r\n  be accorded forensic test results).\r\n\r\nD.  Harmless Error\r\n\r\nThe State maintains that, even if the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying disclosure of the proficiency test results under Rule 5 or Brady, \r\n  such error is harmless. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge in the instant case erred in denying disclosure \r\n  of the proficiency test results under Rule 5 and Brady. Clearly, the \r\n  error was not harmless. Ignoring the DNA evidence presented at trial, \r\n  there was substantial disputation of evidence regarding guilt. The record does \r\n  not disclose overwhelming evidence to support Proctor's conviction in the absence \r\n  of the DNA evidence. We hold there is a reasonable probability that the disclosure \r\n  of SLED's proficiency test results would reasonably have affected the outcome \r\n  of the trial. See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  150 (1985)(error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the \r\n  result of the trial).\r\n\r\nII.  Competency\r\n\r\n\r\nProctor contends the trial court erred in finding him competent to stand trial.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nA trial court's determination of competency will be upheld \r\n  on review if it has evidentiary support and is not against the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996). \r\n  \"The test for competency to stand trial or continue trial is whether the defendant \r\n  has the sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable \r\n  degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational, as well as a \r\n  factual, understanding of the proceedings against him.\" State v. Bell, \r\n  293 S.C. 391, 395-96, 360 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1987)(citing Dusky v. United States, \r\n  362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)). The defendant bears the burden \r\n  of proving his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. Nance, \r\n  320 S.C. at 504, 466 S.E.2d at 351; State v. Lee, 274 S.C. 372, 264 S.E.2d \r\n  418 (1980).\r\n\r\nProctor suffered severe brain damage and paralysis to both legs and one arm as a result of his car\r\naccident.  He was found incompetent to stand trial in 1993.  The State moved to have Proctor re-evaluated in 1996.  After a competency hearing, the trial court determined in June of 1997 that\r\nProctor was competent to stand trial.\r\n\r\nAnother competency hearing was held immediately preceding Proctor's March 1998 trial.  Proctor\r\ntestified at the hearing he had been in court several times for competency hearings and for a\r\nCharleston County trial. (2)  He was aware he had previously been convicted of \"rape\" and breaking\r\nand entering, he knew the name of the Charleston County solicitor, and he knew that the judge in\r\nthe Dorchester County case also presided over the Charleston County case.  Proctor could name\r\nhis three attorneys, but he believed one attorney could not adequately represent him because she\r\nwas upset that she shared the same last name with Proctor.  Proctor could not recall where he was\r\non the date of the criminal sexual conduct involving Victim.  He did not recall reviewing the\r\nevidence in the Charleston County case or in the Dorchester County case with his attorneys. \r\nProctor listed and defined the crimes he was charged with, understood the seriousness of the\r\ncrimes, and noted they carried long sentences.  Proctor stated he learned the roles of the judge and\r\njury by watching \"Matlock\" on television, but he believed a jury consisted of eleven jurors who\r\ndid not have to reach a unanimous verdict.  Proctor declared he understood what his attorneys\r\ndiscussed with him and he believed he could communicate with them.\r\n\r\nDr. Catherine Lewis, a forensic psychiatrist, evaluated \r\n  Proctor on four occasions and testified regarding his competency. Proctor did \r\n  not recall the evidence the State had against him but he described the type \r\n  of evidence which could be used in a CSC trial. Dr. Lewis believed that despite \r\n  Proctor's memory problem, Proctor would benefit from having a notebook or cards \r\n  summarizing the evidence and would be able to work with his attorneys in discussing \r\n  the weight of the evidence. Dr. Lewis opined Proctor was competent to stand \r\n  trial because he understood the trial proceedings and he was able to interact \r\n  with his attorneys and would ask questions if he did not understand.\r\n\r\nDr. Harold Morgan, a forensic psychiatrist, evaluated Proctor \r\n  eight times and testified concerning his competency. Proctor told Dr. Morgan \r\n  during one evaluation that he received a harsher sentence in the Charleston \r\n  County trial because the trial judge became angry when Proctor spoke with his \r\n  attorneys. Dr. Morgan noted Proctor had a factual understanding of the judicial \r\n  process and the charges against him but opined Proctor did not have a rational \r\n  understanding of the process. Dr. Morgan doubted that providing Proctor with \r\n  notebooks or cards summarizing the evidence in the case would aid Proctor because \r\n  his memory deficit rendered him unable to retain information and unable to process \r\n  what happens in court. He believed Proctor was not competent to stand trial \r\n  due to Proctor's memory problems and because his rational understanding was \r\n  impaired.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Lewis and Dr. Morgan testified, Proctor again \r\n  took the stand. He stated he did not recall the questions previously asked of \r\n  him or the testimony of the psychiatrists.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found Proctor did not meet his burden of \r\n  showing he was incompetent and affirmed its prior finding that Proctor was competent \r\n  to stand trial. After the jury began to deliberate in this case, Proctor's counsel \r\n  informed the court of several instances throughout the trial where Proctor could \r\n  not recall recent information or was confused regarding the proceedings.\r\n\r\nProctor concedes he had a factual understanding of the proceedings \r\n  against him. He contends the trial court erred in finding him competent to stand \r\n  trial because his memory deficits rendered him unable to rationally assist his \r\n  attorneys with the defense. Although there was evidence that Proctor was unable \r\n  to recall some information unless it was constantly repeated, Proctor did not \r\n  meet his burden of proving he was unable to assist his attorneys. Proctor understood \r\n  the nature of the charges against him, the seriousness of the charges, and the \r\n  adversarial nature of the proceedings. He consulted his attorneys when he had \r\n  questions. Despite Proctor's amnesia regarding the events surrounding the crime, \r\n  he was able to rationally discuss the trial proceedings with counsel and comprehend \r\n  them.\r\n\r\nWe conclude there was ample evidence to support the trial \r\n  court's finding that Proctor was competent to stand trial despite his amnesia. \r\n  Further, the trial judge's determination of competency is not against the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the trial judge did not err in finding Proctor competent \r\n  to stand trial. The State's evidence reveals that Proctor has the sufficient \r\n  present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational \r\n  understanding and Proctor possesses a rational, as well as a factual, understanding \r\n  of the proceedings against him.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the trial court erred in denying Proctor's motion \r\n  to have the proficiency test records of the DNA expert disclosed. We hold that, \r\n  pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. \r\n  1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), a defendant is entitled to the pre-trial production \r\n  of DNA proficiency test records of the SLED DNA expert. We bifurcate the mandate \r\n  of production:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) outside laboratory proficiency tests and records and\r\n\r\n  2) SLED laboratory proficiency tests and records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the outside laboratory proficiency tests and records \r\n  done in the accreditation process, we order the pre-trial production of all \r\n  records of proficiency testing of personnel in the laboratories where Restriction \r\n  Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analyses, \r\n  the two types of DNA testing procedures, are performed in the case and records \r\n  of laboratory error rates resulting from external blind forensic DNA analyses \r\n  or any other studies pertaining to error rates.\r\n\r\nAs to the SLED laboratory proficiency tests and records, \r\n  we limit the production to the results of proficiency testing of personnel \r\n  and the results of laboratory error rates resulting from internal blind \r\n  forensic DNA analyses or any other studies pertaining to error rates.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we remand the case to the Dorchester County \r\n  Court of General Sessions and direct that an in camera Bryant  hearing \r\n  be held to determine whether the records and information produced are material \r\n  to the defendant's case. If the Circuit Court Judge (3) \r\n  concludes the records and information are material, the judge shall order a \r\n  new trial. If the records and information are not material, the Circuit \r\n  Judge shall affirm the convictions of Duncan R. Proctor.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n1. Not at all, not so.\r\n2. A few weeks prior to this trial, Proctor \r\n  was convicted of one count of first degree burglary and four counts of first \r\n  degree CSC as to a woman in Charleston County.  \r\n3. We note the trial judge has retired. \r\n  The remand of this case is to the Circuit Court.

We affirm in \r\n  part, reverse in part and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nRichard T. Widman (Husband) and Dale Poulnot Widman (Wife) \r\n  were married in 1981 on Valentine's Day. When they married, Husband was thirty-two \r\n  years old and Wife was twenty-five years old. Husband earned a Masters of Business \r\n  Administration in hotel and restaurant management at Michigan State University \r\n  and worked as the General Manager of the Mills House Hotel in Charleston, South \r\n  Carolina. Wife graduated magna cum laude from Duke University and worked in \r\n  her family's business, Kerrison's Department Store.\r\n\r\nHusband, who worked for Holiday Inn in a management position, \r\n  received a job transfer to Detroit, Michigan, and after they were married, Wife \r\n  joined Husband in Detroit. Wife's father subsequently requested that Wife come \r\n  back to the family business. The parties agreed, and Wife moved back to Charleston \r\n  in August of 1981. Husband continued to work for Holiday Inn, and the parties \r\n  commuted for a period of time, until Husband quit his job and moved back to \r\n  Charleston in the summer of 1982. After his return, Husband joined a venture \r\n  to build King's Courtyard Inn in downtown Charleston. The inn was opened in \r\n  November 1983 and was managed by Husband. During the early years, Husband earned \r\n  money through some consulting work and drew a minimal salary for managing the \r\n  inn. Thus, toward the beginning of the marriage, Wife generally earned greater \r\n  income than Husband. This changed drastically, however, after Husband's venture \r\n  in King's Courtyard Inn and several subsequent hotel inns began to reap substantial \r\n  profits.\r\n\r\nDuring the marriage, the parties accumulated a $6,720,000.00 \r\n  marital estate consisting of numerous inns and related businesses worth more \r\n  than $5,000,000.00, two marital homes with equity of more than $900,000.00, \r\n  as well as various stocks, bonds, life insurance, and pension plans. Additionally, \r\n  Husband's annual income grew to approximately $450,000.00 while Wife's annual \r\n  income remained around $40,000.00. During the development years of the inns, \r\n  Husband used earned income of the parties and distributions from ownership of \r\n  the inns to reinvest into the businesses in order to promote their growth and \r\n  viability. The inns are set up as limited partnerships with Husband as the general \r\n  partner, which gives Husband the discretion of when to make a distribution from \r\n  revenues and the amount of each distribution. Husband maintained control of \r\n  the businesses' cash flow and the parties' income. Even after the inns were \r\n  established and producing significant income, Husband continued to use his income \r\n  and distributions to support the business. Money flowed freely between the business \r\n  and personal accounts of the parties. Loans were made to the businesses from \r\n  the parties' joint personal checking account; partnership shares were purchased \r\n  out of the parties' joint personal checking account; and money was borrowed \r\n  from the businesses to keep the family finances afloat. In addition, the personal \r\n  and business accounts of the parties were used interchangeably by the parties. \r\n  \r\n\r\nWife had no day-to-day responsibilities for the inns; however, \r\n  she hosted several openings of new inns and entertained Husband's business associates. \r\n  At Husband's insistence, Wife traveled with him out of the country, at the expense \r\n  of her own professional responsibilities to Kerrison's. Wife also participated \r\n  in the designing and writing of marketing brochures for the inns, and worked \r\n  on a project for the Rutledge House Inn. Husband continually assured Wife that \r\n  \"the inns were their retirement.\" \r\n\r\nHusband's parents made significant investments in the inns \r\n  and advanced $75,000.00 to the parties for development of one of the businesses. \r\n  However, these were arm's length transactions. Husband's parents appear to have \r\n  profited from the investments, and they obtained a note and mortgage on the \r\n  parties' beach home as collateral for the $75,000.00 loan. At the time of trial, \r\n  the parties were still obligated to make monthly payments to repay this loan. \r\n  Additionally, Husband's parents made generous monetary gifts over the years \r\n  to Husband, Wife and the parties' children. Husband's father testified as to \r\n  the various monetary gifts made to the parties over the years, and stated that \r\n  many of the gifts were intended to help Husband in his business ventures. Husband's \r\n  father testified, however, that all of the gifts were joint gifts to Husband \r\n  and Wife. The gifted monies were not kept separate and apart from marital funds. \r\n  The check registers of various accounts show that money was used from any and \r\n  all sources to support the cash flow of the businesses. Moreover, Husband's \r\n  parents never asserted prior to litigation that the gifted monies were for anything \r\n  other than the benefit of both parties and the support of the marriage.\r\n\r\nDuring the marriage, Husband inherited $192,000.00 from \r\n  his aunt's estate. Husband testified he used some of these funds to purchase \r\n  two shares of stock in the inn businesses. One share of stock was purchased \r\n  from Ronald Hutcherson in the John Rutledge House. The other share was purchased \r\n  from the Gary Olin Trust in the King's Courtyard Inn. Wife also owned nonmarital \r\n  property which included 26 shares of Kerrison's stock, valued at $100,000.00, \r\n  a 1/3rd interest in the carriage house located behind her parent's home in downtown \r\n  Charleston, and a 1/9th interest in an unimproved lot on Sullivan's Island. \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband and Wife have three daughters, all three of whom \r\n  were minors at the time of trial. Husband also has an adult daughter from a \r\n  prior marriage. The parties employed a housekeeper/nanny to assist with the \r\n  children and housework, but both parties contributed substantially to the needs \r\n  of the children in the home. All three girls attend a private school, Ashley \r\n  Hall School, where Wife is currently employed as the Director of Development. \r\n  The tuition for all three girls is $2,050.00 per month. The children also attend \r\n  summer camps in North Carolina every year, which cost between $1,815.00 and \r\n  $2,810.00 per child each summer. \r\n\r\nHusband instituted this action in November 1997, after Wife's \r\n  investigator confirmed Husband's adulterous affair with Linn Lesesne, the Director \r\n  of Sales and Marketing for the management company formed by Husband to manage \r\n  all the inns. Wife first became suspicious of the affair in October 1996 and \r\n  confronted Husband on several occasions, but Husband continued to deny the relationship. \r\n  Husband and Wife separated in April 1997, but began going to marriage counseling \r\n  in an effort to save their marriage. However, Husband continued his affair with \r\n  Linn Lesesne. Upon receiving the report from the investigator in August of 1997, \r\n  Wife waited until Husband returned from a trip to confront him with the report. \r\n  Husband continued to deny the affair until a couple of weeks later. The marriage \r\n  counselor testified that he believed Wife had been emotionally abused by Husband \r\n  during the marriage and that Wife was more active in attempting to save the \r\n  marriage.\r\n\r\nHusband filed this action seeking, inter alia, joint custody \r\n  of the parties' three minor children, or in the alternative extensive visitation, \r\n  a determination of reasonable child support, and equitable division of the marital \r\n  property. Husband also sought a temporary order restraining Wife from harassing \r\n  him or interfering with his right to a peaceful existence, as well as from using \r\n  vulgar, profane language or making disparaging remarks about him in the presence \r\n  of his children. \r\n\r\nWife answered and counter-claimed seeking, among other things, \r\n  a divorce on the ground of adultery, custody, child support, alimony, equitable \r\n  apportionment of marital property, and an order restraining Husband from exposing \r\n  their children to his extramarital relationship and from selling or encumbering \r\n  marital property. Wife also sought attorneys' fees and costs for litigation \r\n  of the divorce. \r\n\r\nBy temporary order dated June 23, 1998, the court awarded \r\n  Wife temporary custody of the children, $15,000.00 monthly in temporary total \r\n  support, and $25,000.00 for attorney and expert fees. The court also awarded \r\n  visitation for Husband as agreed to between the parties and required Husband \r\n  to keep the minor children out of the presence or proximity of his paramour \r\n  pending the divorce and to attend and complete a session of the \"Consider the \r\n  Children\" program.\r\n\r\nEach side filed motions to hold the other in contempt for \r\n  failure to comply with the court's orders compelling discovery and for violating \r\n  orders of protection. The parties agreed to have these issues addressed at the \r\n  final hearing. Additionally, the parties agreed to bifurcate the issue of attorneys' \r\n  fees and costs. \r\n\r\nThe final hearing began on February 16, 1999 and concluded \r\n  on February 19, 1999. By final order dated March 19, 1999, the trial judge granted \r\n  Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery. Wife was also awarded one-half of \r\n  the marital estate, which the court valued at $6,720,000.00, custody of the \r\n  minor children, and child support in the amount of $3,500.00 per month. Wife \r\n  did not receive an alimony award. However, Husband was ordered to execute a \r\n  note and mortgage payable to Wife covering the majority of Wife's share of the \r\n  marital estate, totaling $2,451,042. The court further ordered Husband to pay \r\n  the note and mortgage over a 240-month period at 6% interest. To satisfy the \r\n  remainder of Wife's share of the marital estate, Husband was ordered to immediately \r\n  transfer certain property in his possession to Wife.\r\n\r\nIn the final divorce decree, the court included judgment \r\n  on the outstanding rules to show cause and motions for contempt. In its decree, \r\n  the trial court found Wife to be in willful violation of the court's order for \r\n  (1) failing to file proper financial declarations as previously ordered, (2) \r\n  disclosing information to Husband's parents and adult daughter regarding Husband's \r\n  prior adulterous conduct, and (3) intentionally withholding the existence of \r\n  a trust which was the subject of a motion to compel. Consequently, the trial \r\n  judge sentenced Wife to 30 days in jail on each of the first two violations, \r\n  but suspended that sentence upon \"strict compliance with the terms of this order\" \r\n  and that Wife refrain from further denigration of Husband or damage to his reputation, \r\n  and from further use of discovery information except for purposes of enforcing \r\n  the court's order. The court further required Wife to pay \"attorneys' fees and \r\n  costs for the prosecution of these Rules to Show Cause.\" For the failure to \r\n  disclose the existence of a trust, the court ordered Wife to reimburse Husband \r\n  \"for the cost of compelling the disclosure of same.\" \r\n\r\nFollowing Husband's motion to alter or amend, the trial \r\n  court issued an order on November 3, 1999, modifying the final order. In this \r\n  supplemental order, the court corrected certain mathematical errors and clarified \r\n  that the interest paid on the note should be designated as lump-sum alimony \r\n  for taxation purposes. The order further provided as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    By agreement of the parties, the court was authorized to \r\n      approve the language of the Note and Mortgage to be executed by [Husband] \r\n      in favor of [Wife] to secure [Wife's] equitable apportionment of marital \r\n      assets. The Final Decree and Order provided for the Note and Mortgage and \r\n      instructed that the parties agree upon the appropriate language. Due to \r\n      the complexity of the Note and Mortgage and upon reconsideration, the court \r\n      finds it appropriate that the attorneys for [Husband] and [Wife] agree upon \r\n      an independent attorney practiced and well versed in real estate and business \r\n      transactions to prepare the terms of the Note and Mortgage being guided \r\n      by this Court's order. Should the attorneys not agree on an individual attorney, \r\n      each attorney is to submit the name of two attorneys from which the Court \r\n      shall select the individual to prepare the terms of the Note and Mortgage. \r\n      . . . In addition to the language in the Order and other normal language \r\n      of a commercial Note and Mortgage, there should be included a due on sale \r\n      clause, an acceleration clause, a refinance clause, [and] language indicating \r\n      that a default in first Mortgage would result in default of second Mortgage. \r\n      The acceleration, due on sale and default clauses need to be established \r\n      on a pro rata basis. There shall also be provisions for the substitution \r\n      of collateral to allow [Husband] to refinance the mortgaged property in \r\n      a commercially reasonable manner which does not affect the interest of [Wife]. \r\n      The Family Court retains jurisdiction to grant relief to either party in \r\n      the interpretation of and practical application of the Note and Mortgage.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTo date the note and mortgage have not been signed because \r\n  the terms are in dispute. Husband filed a notice of appeal and Wife has cross-appealed. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing an appeal from the family court, this court \r\n  has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992). We are not, however, required to disregard the findings of \r\n  the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. \r\n  Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 537, 532 S.E.2d 19, 22 (Ct. App. 2000); \r\n  Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 207, 532 S.E.2d 890, 892 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Husband's Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n  A. Equitable Apportionment\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1. Division of Marital Estate\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband first argues that the trial judge abused his discretion \r\n  in awarding one-half of the marital estate to Wife, because he failed to give \r\n  any weight to the financial contributions of Husband's family and gave too much \r\n  weight to Husband's fault in the break-up of the marriage. He asserts the trial \r\n  judge used the equitable division award to punish Husband, and the judge failed \r\n  to acknowledge his family's contributions to the marital estate. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within the discretion \r\n  of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion. Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988); \r\n  Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987). South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2000) enumerates fifteen factors \r\n  applicable to a determination of equitable distribution. These factors are as \r\n  follows: (1) duration of the marriage, (2) marital misconduct or fault and its \r\n  effect on the break-up of the marriage, (3) the value of the marital property \r\n  and the contribution of each spouse to the acquisition or appreciation in value \r\n  of the marital property, including the contribution of the spouse as homemaker, \r\n  (4) the income and earning potential of each spouse and opportunity for future \r\n  acquisition of assets, (5) the health, both physical and emotional, of each \r\n  spouse, (6) need of either spouse for additional training or education, (7) \r\n  the nonmarital property of each spouse, (8) the existence or nonexistence of \r\n  vested retirement benefits for each spouse, (9) whether alimony has been awarded, \r\n  (10) desirability of awarding the family home, (11) the tax consequence to each \r\n  spouse as a result of the apportionment, (12) the existence and extent of any \r\n  support obligations of either party, (13) liens and encumbrances on marital \r\n  and separate property and other existing debts, (14) child custody arrangements \r\n  and obligations, and (15) any other relevant factors as the trial court shall \r\n  expressly enumerate in its order. The statute vests in the family court the \r\n  discretion to decide what weight should be assigned to the various factors. \r\n  On review, this court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and \r\n  if the end result is equitable, the fact that this court might have weighed \r\n  specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant. Johnson \r\n  v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); see \r\n  also  Ball v. Ball, 314 S.C. 445, 448, 445 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1994) \r\n  (the family court has wide discretion in determining the contributions made \r\n  by each spouse to the marital estate; the weight to be accorded evidence of \r\n  marital misconduct is for the court to determine in the exercise of its discretion); \r\n  Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (the \r\n  reviewing court will affirm the family court judge's apportionment of marital \r\n  property if it can be determined that the judge addressed factors under statute \r\n  governing apportionment with sufficiency for the reviewing court to conclude \r\n  that judge was cognizant of statutory factors).\r\n\r\nHere, the family court set forth several facts relevant \r\n  to its equitable division of the marital estate. The court considered, among \r\n  other things (1) the length of this 18-year marriage, (2) the Husband's adulterous \r\n  affair and its contribution to the break-up of the marriage as well as its effect \r\n  on the economic circumstances of the parties, (3) the value of the marital property \r\n  and the direct and indirect contributions of both parties to the marital estate, \r\n  (4) the disparity of income and earning potential of Wife, (5) the devastating \r\n  effect of the break-up of the marriage on Wife, (6) the nonmarital property \r\n  of each party, (7) the nonexistence of vested retirement benefits, and (8) tax \r\n  ramifications in allowing Husband to designate the interest paid on the note \r\n  and mortgage to Wife as alimony for tax purposes only. Further, we note the \r\n  court expressly recognized the generosity of the Husband's parents to the parties \r\n  over the years. \r\n\r\nOur review of the record convinces us the family court addressed \r\n  factors under the statute governing apportionment with sufficiency to indicate \r\n  the court was cognizant of those factors. Furthermore, in considering the overall \r\n  fairness of the apportionment we find the end result to be equitable. Accordingly, \r\n  we are not persuaded Husband has established an abuse of discretion by the family \r\n  court in its apportionment of the marital estate. Finally, giving due deference \r\n  to the court's authority to assign such weight to the relevant factors as it \r\n  deems appropriate, we will not second-guess the trial court's consideration \r\n  of Husband's marital misconduct, its impact on the dissolution of the marriage, \r\n  and the subsequent economic effect on the parties. Therefore, we affirm the \r\n  trial court's apportionment of the marital estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    2. Execution of Mortgage\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNext, Husband argues the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in requiring him to execute a mortgage \"which had the effect of making Wife \r\n  a co-owner of his business, [preventing] Husband from operating his business \r\n  and [possibly forcing] him into bankruptcy.\" He does not take issue with the \r\n  trial court's authority to order the execution of the mortgage, but asserts \r\n  rather that the method of division of the property, i.e., the inclusion of the \r\n  mortgage, was not reasonable. (1) We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe trial court has wide discretion in determining how to \r\n  distribute marital property, and it may use any reasonable means to divide the \r\n  property equitably. Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, \r\n  41-42 (1995). The trial court determined that Wife was entitled to one-half \r\n  of the entire marital estate. Although Wife received a portion of her property \r\n  in kind, including a home, a car, and certain personal property, the bulk of \r\n  her share of the property, more than $2,400,000.00, is invested in the inns. \r\n  It is apparent from the record that Husband desired to maintain control of all \r\n  the inns rather than transfer ownership or interest in any of the inns to Wife. \r\n  The court therefore ordered Husband to make payments on the $2,400,000.00 debt \r\n  to Wife over a period of 240 months at 6% interest. The court further ordered \r\n  Husband to execute a note, secured by a mortgage on all properties in which \r\n  Husband had an interest, with the exception of the residence awarded Husband \r\n  in the divorce. In return, Husband was declared by the courts to be the sole \r\n  owner of the marital interests in the inns. The court determined this would \r\n  be the most equitable way to effect the distribution of Wife's remaining share \r\n  of the marital property.\r\n\r\nThe court had the option of forcing the parties to sell \r\n  the inns and split the proceeds, or dividing the inns between the parties. Husband, \r\n  however, apparently sought ownership of all the inns. Further, it is an inescapable \r\n  conclusion that Husband's continued ownership and management of the inns would \r\n  allow the parties to reap the full financial benefits of the businesses. A distribution \r\n  of the assets in kind to the parties would leave Wife at a severe disadvantage, \r\n  as the inns would not have the value for her that they do for Husband. By structuring \r\n  the division in this manner, the trial court enabled the parties to maintain \r\n  their optimal stream of income. In doing so, however, Wife has to wait twenty \r\n  years to receive her full share of the marital property. Having reviewed the \r\n  overall fairness of the apportionment, we find the end result to be equitable \r\n  and thus must affirm the trial court's apportionment of the marital estate. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  B. Valuation of Gary Olin Stock\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband contends the trial court erred in valuing his share \r\n  of the Gary Olin stock, purchased with funds from an inheritance, at only $30,000.00. \r\n  He argues, although the share was purchased for $30,000.00, the record shows \r\n  the value of that one share was actually $122,821.00. Wife asserts the trial \r\n  court's evaluation correctly incorporated the value of the Olin share in King's \r\n  Courtyard Inn as stipulated to by the parties' experts.\r\n\r\nThe record shows the parties stipulated to the values of \r\n  the various business entities belonging to Husband and Wife, as jointly determined \r\n  by the parties' two experts. The experts prepared a schedule of the various \r\n  businesses which contained breakdowns of the values based on the general and \r\n  limited partnership interests. In valuing the property as of November 30, 1998, \r\n  the schedule placed a value of $245,644.00 on the parties' 24.81% limited partnership \r\n  interest in King's Courtyard Inn. A Footnote to this value indicates it was \r\n  determined based on the payment of $30,000.00 in May of 1997 for a 3.03% limited \r\n  partnership interest. (2) In other words, if \r\n  a 3.03% interest were worth $30,000.00, a 24.81% interest would be worth $245,644.00. \r\n  \r\n\r\nOne of Husband's witnesses, Mr. Feinberg, placed a value \r\n  of $90,000.00 on the Olin share in King's Courtyard Inn, based on the 3% share \r\n  developing into a 9% interest in the business. However, Mr. Feinberg stated \r\n  Husband's expert witness, Dr. Perry Woodside, would be better able to testify \r\n  to the value of that share. Wife's expert, Francis Humphries, who worked on \r\n  the stipulated values with Dr. Woodside, testified the Olin share in King's \r\n  Courtyard Inn was used to purchase \"a 19/54th interest in 75 percent of the \r\n  Wentworth Mansion equity,\" leaving a 5.5555% interest in the Wentworth Mansion \r\n  valued at $14,355.00. There is nothing in the record from Dr. Woodside's testimony \r\n  indicating he ever placed a value on the Olin share.\r\n\r\nOn direct examination, Husband testified he purchased a \r\n  share in King's Courtyard Inn from the widow of Gary Olin with money he received \r\n  from his aunt's estate. He stated the Olin limited partnership share remained \r\n  in King's Courtyard Inn. Subsequently, Husband was recalled to the stand to \r\n  discuss why he disagreed with the valuation of the share as determined by Mr. \r\n  Humphries. He explained that he purchased a 3.33% interest in the inn from Olin's \r\n  widow and that refinancing occurred, moving nineteen shares in King's Courtyard \r\n  Inn to Wentworth Mansion. He stated there were only two limited partnership \r\n  shares remaining, one of which was the Olin share, the other being one he had \r\n  previously purchased. According to Husband, he held a limited partnership interest \r\n  of a little more than 24% and half of that, or 12%, was the Olin share. Accordingly, \r\n  he determined the value of that one share to be around $122,000.00, representing \r\n  half of the total value of the limited partnership as stipulated to by the parties.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the value of the Gary Olin stock was \r\n  $30,000.00, based on Husband's testimony that it stayed in King's Courtyard \r\n  Inn and was not transferred to Wentworth Mansion, and based on \"the value of \r\n  a share of stock in the King's Courtyard Inn, as stipulated to by the parties.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Husband, the one share of stock purchased in \r\n  May of 1997 for $30,000.00 increased in value to $122,821.00 by November of \r\n  1998. Husband makes a compelling argument that, if there are only two shares \r\n  of limited partnership stock remaining, the value of one share is half of the \r\n  total value of the limited partnership interest. However, in reviewing the record, \r\n  it is impossible to discern whether the experts contemplated the 24.82% limited \r\n  partnership interest comprised only two shares of stock. There is no evidence \r\n  of record the experts deemed the Olin share of stock transformed from a little \r\n  more than 3% to more than 12% and represented half of the stipulated $245,644.00 \r\n  total value of the limited partnership interest. While there is testimony from \r\n  Husband that only two shares of limited partnership stock remained in King's \r\n  Courtyard Inn, there is no evidence as to when the twenty-one shares were reduced \r\n  down to two shares and whether this occurred before or after the November 1998 \r\n  valuation date. Neither is there any evidence as to whether the experts took \r\n  the total number of limited partnership shares outstanding into consideration. \r\n  It is clear they valued the total interest at $245,644.00 and based that value \r\n  on a purchase price of $30,000.00 for one share representing a little more than \r\n  3%, but it is less clear as to whether they would then equate that one share \r\n  into a 12% interest at the critical time of valuation.\r\n\r\nBoth parties rely, at least in part, on the experts' stipulated \r\n  schedule in arguing their values for the stock. This court is not comfortable, \r\n  however, making a determination that the one share of stock has aggrandized \r\n  from a $30,000.00 value to more than $122,000.00 in only a year and a half, \r\n  based in part on the experts' stipulation and in part on Husband's testimony. \r\n  This is especially so in light of the fact that the full extent of the experts' \r\n  opinions on this matter was not detailed by document or by testimony, other \r\n  than testimony from Wife's expert that the Olin share was transformed into an \r\n  interest in Wentworth Mansion and was valued at only $14,355.00. \r\n  (3) However, neither is it clear that the experts would value the \r\n  Olin share at only $30,000.00 in November of 1998, based on the purchase made \r\n  in May of 1997. Because we find no clear indication from the experts' stipulated \r\n  documents as to what value they would have placed on one share of the limited \r\n  partnership stock at the time of valuation in November 1998, we remand this \r\n  issue to the lower court for redetermination of the value. In so doing, the \r\n  court may take additional testimony as offered by the parties on the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  C. Marital vs. Non-Marital Property\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, Husband argues that the family court erred in including \r\n  the Merrill Lynch account in the marital estate, arguing it is his nonmarital \r\n  property traced to an inheritance from his aunt. We disagree.\r\n\r\nMarital property is defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 \r\n  (Supp. 2000) as \"all real and personal property which has been acquired by the \r\n  parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement \r\n  of marital litigation . . . regardless of how legal title is held, except the \r\n  following, which constitute[s] nonmarital property: (1) property acquired by \r\n  either party by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than \r\n  the spouse.\" The burden of showing an exemption under Â§ 20-7-473 is upon the \r\n  party claiming that property acquired during the marriage is nonmarital. Pool \r\n  v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 89, 467 S.E.2d 753, 757 (Ct. App. 1996), aff'd \r\n  as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).\r\n\r\nIn this case, Husband claims that three stocks in the Merrill \r\n  Lynch account are part of his inheritance from his Aunt Kathryn. He asserts, \r\n  because the account is listed in his name only, and is included in his financial \r\n  declaration and financial statement provided to banks, the stocks must be deemed \r\n  his nonmarital property. However, Husband points to no testimony indicating \r\n  the three stocks in question came from this inheritance, and the paper trails \r\n  he provided are woefully inadequate to support his assertion. Appellant has \r\n  the burden of convincing this court that the trial judge committed error in \r\n  his findings. In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001); Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 329, 536 S.E.2d 427, 429 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nFurther, while property acquired by either party by inheritance \r\n  from a party other than the spouse is generally considered nonmarital property, \r\n  nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if: (1) it becomes \r\n  so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly \r\n  titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in \r\n  some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital \r\n  property. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 536-37 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). Transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the \r\n  facts of each case, and the spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective \r\n  evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded \r\n  the property as the common property of the marriage. Id. \r\n\r\nThe evidence here shows that funds from the Merrill Lynch \r\n  account were used by Husband in support of the marriage or in some other manner, \r\n  evidencing his intent to make it marital property. Funds from the account were \r\n  used to pay down the equity line on one of their homes. Funds were used from \r\n  the account to pay off loans on the inns, as well as purchase more stock in \r\n  the inns from other investors. The account was also used for improvements to \r\n  one of the homes, and to pay on the parties' personal credit card. Based on \r\n  this evidence, the court found that \"assets . . . listed in the parties' names \r\n  individually had been co-mingled to an extent as to result in transmutation\" \r\n  and that the parties' \"stocks and bonds, with the exception of the stocks held \r\n  by Wife in the Kerrison's Company, are all marital properties.\" We find that \r\n  by commingling the inheritance funds with funds from the parties' marital account \r\n  so as to become untraceable, and generally using funds from the account to support \r\n  the marriage, any such assets from the inheritance were transmuted into marital \r\n  property. We therefore find no error.\r\n\r\n\r\n  D. Miscalculation of the Wife's Share\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Husband argues that the family court made a mathematical \r\n  error in dividing the marital estate. We find this issue is not preserved for \r\n  our review. \r\n\r\nDuring the hearing on Husband's motion to amend, Wife pointed \r\n  out several mathematical errors in the final order. Specifically, she indicated \r\n  the order reflected a $6,700,000.00 marital estate, when the exact figure should \r\n  have been $6,720,906.00. She further noted the proper computations on the division \r\n  of the individual assets would give Husband a total valuation of marital property \r\n  of $5,739,255.00, and Wife a total valuation of $889,651.00. The trial judge \r\n  indicated he had simply used the $6,700,000.00 figure as an estimate in some \r\n  places of the order, but agreed all references to the value could be changed \r\n  in the order to reflect the exact figure. Husband agreed to the proposed change. \r\n  The judge also stated he had made an error in arithmetic in the valuation of \r\n  the total assets awarded to both Husband and Wife, and those figures should \r\n  be changed to reflect the proper amounts. Again, Husband agreed. The court issued \r\n  an order modifying the final order and addressing Husband's motion to amend \r\n  on November 3, 1999. In this supplemental order, the court made the correction \r\n  involving the total value of the marital estate, finding it should reflect a \r\n  figure of $6,720,000.00. As well, the court corrected the figures for the total \r\n  values of the properties awarded to Husband and to Wife, finding they were $5,739,255.00 \r\n  and $889,651.00, respectively. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Husband claims that the November 3, 1999 order \r\n  modifying the final order contains a mathematical mistake in valuing the entire \r\n  marital estate at $6,720,000.00. He argues the totals of the properties awarded \r\n  to Husband ($5,739,255.00) and Wife ($889,651.00) equal $6,628,906.00, not $6,720,000.00. \r\n  However, these inconsistencies were never brought to the family court's attention. \r\n  Husband never asserted the $6,720,000.00 figure should be adjusted based on \r\n  the corrections to the other figures, but conceded at the hearing on his motion \r\n  to amend that the order should be modified to reflect the $6,720,000.00 figure. \r\n  The errors complained of by Husband here are being raised for the first time \r\n  on appeal. The family court has not had an opportunity to rule upon the issue \r\n  and therefore, it is not preserved for appellate review. As a general rule, \r\n  an issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been \r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the court below to be preserved for appellate review. \r\n  Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding \r\n  an issue not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an \r\n  argument and the appellant fails to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment on that ground). See also  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, \r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (issue cannot be raised for the \r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial \r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review). Because Husband failed to argue \r\n  this position below, and because he conceded the valuation of which he now complains, \r\n  we find no preserved error.\r\n\r\nII. Wife's Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n  A. Contempt\r\n\r\n\r\nWife contends that the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  by finding her in contempt of court, arguing there is no clear and convincing \r\n  evidence that she willfully violated any court order. Specifically, she asserts \r\n  error in the court's findings of contempt for her (1) failure to file proper \r\n  financial declarations as previously ordered, (2) disclosure of information \r\n  to Husband's parents and adult daughter regarding Husband's prior adulterous \r\n  conduct, and (3) intentional withholding of the existence of a trust which was \r\n  the subject of a motion to compel. \r\n\r\n\"The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts \r\n  and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.\" In re \r\n  Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998). Contempt results from \r\n  the willful disobedience of a court order, and before a court may find a person \r\n  in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous \r\n  conduct. Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 \r\n  (1989). A willful act is one which is \"done voluntarily and intentionally with \r\n  the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent \r\n  to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad \r\n  purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.\" Spartanburg County Dept \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988). \r\n  \"In a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party \r\n  must show the existence of the order, and the facts establishing the respondent's \r\n  noncompliance.\" Brasington v. Shannon, 288 S.C. 183, 184, 341 S.E.2d \r\n  130, 131 (1986). Once the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the \r\n  burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability \r\n  to comply with the order. Henderson, 298 S.C. at 197, 379 S.E.2d at 129. \r\n  A determination of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, \r\n  but his decision will be reversed when the finding is without evidentiary support \r\n  or there is an abuse of discretion. Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 538, \r\n  532 S.E.2d 19, 22 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1. Financial Declaration\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA pretrial order was filed on January 11, 1999, which directed \r\n  the parties, in part, to \"provide current financial declarations within ten \r\n  days,\" and to have all real property appraised, with the appraisals to be completed \r\n  by January 30, 1999. Husband subsequently filed a motion to compel Wife to submit \r\n  a complete and updated financial declaration, \"indicating the values of assets.\" \r\n  Following a hearing on the matter, the court, by order filed January 25, 1999, \r\n  ordered Wife to \"provide a current, complete financial declaration, including \r\n  an assets addendum, to [Husband's] attorney within twenty-four (24) hours.\" \r\n  Wife submitted a financial declaration signed January 26 which included valuations \r\n  for some of the assets, but noted the appraisals were not complete as to the \r\n  values of the real estate, and therefore did not include those values nor the \r\n  total value of all assets. At trial, Wife submitted a final financial declaration, \r\n  which included all property values of the assets.\r\n\r\nWife asserts she complied with the January 25 order \"as \r\n  best she could,\" given that the appraisals were incomplete. According to the \r\n  January 11 order, Wife had until January 30 to complete the appraisals of the \r\n  real property. However, Wife offers no excuse as to why she did not submit an \r\n  updated financial declaration, complete with an asset addendum including the \r\n  appraised values, as of January 30. The January 11 and January 25 orders clearly \r\n  instructed the Wife to provide this information by that date. Further, there \r\n  is no evidence Wife requested additional time from Husband or moved the court \r\n  for additional time, based on an inability to complete the appraisals as ordered. \r\n  In spite of the clear orders of the court, Wife waited to submit the proper \r\n  financial declaration at the trial on February 16, thereby depriving Husband \r\n  of an opportunity to completely prepare his case. Accordingly, we find the evidence \r\n  supports the trial judge's finding of willful contempt as to the financial declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    2. Disclosure of Information\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn December 11, 1998, the court ordered Husband's psychiatrist \r\n  to produce Husband's file to Wife and ordered that \"the contents of the file \r\n  shall not be disseminated except as needed in the course of this litigation \r\n  and under no circumstances are the parties' minor children to be told any of \r\n  the information in [Husband's] file.\" On January 27, 1999, the court issued \r\n  a protective order restraining the parties \"from disseminating any information \r\n  learned in any deposition in this case which relates in any way to, or is derived \r\n  from, information contained in the records of the parties' therapists, with \r\n  any person except his or her lawyer, his or her expert, and his or her parents \r\n  and siblings.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these orders, during a very emotional phone \r\n  conversation with Husband's parents, Wife disclosed information of an affair \r\n  Husband had in 1983, which she discovered after reviewing his psychological \r\n  records. Wife stated during her cross-examination testimony that she told Husband's \r\n  parents about the previous affair because they had accused her of stalling the \r\n  case, and she was hurt and \"felt so slammed\" by the conversation with his parents. \r\n  She admitted, however, that she knew she was under a court order not to disclose \r\n  this information, and that she was guilty of violating the order.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Wife asserts she only disclosed this information \r\n  to Husband's parents while defending herself against unwarranted attacks, and \r\n  she \"believed she was within her rights to divulge this information as necessary \r\n  to the litigation.\" This position is directly contrary, however, to her admission \r\n  at trial that she knew she was under a court order not to disclose the information \r\n  and that she was in violation of the order. Accordingly, there is evidentiary \r\n  support for the trial court's finding on this issue, and we find no abuse of \r\n  discretion.\r\n\r\nWife also asserts on appeal that the trial court erred in \r\n  finding her in contempt for disclosing Husband's prior adulterous conduct to \r\n  Husband's adult daughter from a previous marriage. We agree. The record shows \r\n  Wife informed Husband's adult daughter as to Husband's ongoing adulterous relationship \r\n  with Linn Lesesne, not the prior adulterous conduct of Husband that occurred \r\n  in 1983. Further, there is no evidence the orders in question had even been \r\n  issued at the time of Wife's conversation with her stepdaughter. There is simply \r\n  no evidence that Wife disclosed anything to the Husband's daughter which she \r\n  was prohibited from disclosing by court order. Accordingly, we reverse so much \r\n  of the court's order as finds Wife in contempt for disclosing information to \r\n  Husband's daughter, for lack of evidentiary support. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n    3. Failure to Disclose the Trust\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1999, Husband filed a motion to compel T. \r\n  Heyward Carter, Jr., one of the estate planning attorneys for Wife's parents, \r\n  to fully comply with the subpoena which demanded that he produce any trust documents \r\n  involving Wife. Husband argued he was trying to find \"a present existing trust \r\n  from which [Wife was] deriving real money, which . . . would affect [Husband's] \r\n  alimony payment.\" On February 5, 1999, the family court filed its order requiring \r\n  Mr. Carter to produce any original trust documents in which Wife was named as \r\n  a beneficiary. Thereafter, Husband discovered an insurance trust on Wife's parents \r\n  naming Wife and her siblings as beneficiaries. This trust was established to \r\n  pay the estate taxes of Wife's parents' estate, effective only upon the death \r\n  of both her parents. Consequently, on February 14, 1999, Husband filed a motion \r\n  to hold Wife in contempt for failing to disclose the existence of this trust.\r\n\r\nWife argues on appeal that the family court erred in finding \r\n  her in contempt for failing to disclose the existence of this trust. We agree. \r\n  In the final order, the court held, \"I find the Wife to be in wilful contempt \r\n  for intentionally withholding the existence\" of \"a trust which was subject to \r\n  the Motion to Compel heard by this Judge.\" However, there is no evidence that \r\n  Wife willfully withheld this information because nothing in the record indicates \r\n  that she was even aware of the existence of the trust. Wife testified at trial \r\n  that she was not aware of the existence of the trust, and the record contains \r\n  no evidence that the existence of the trust was ever communicated to her or \r\n  that she tried to conceal it. Moreover, Wife was not the subject of Husband's \r\n  motion to compel, nor was she included in the court's order compelling disclosure \r\n  of the trust documents. Accordingly, we find that the court erred in holding \r\n  Wife in contempt on this basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  B. Uncovered Medical Expenses\r\n\r\n\r\nWife argues that the trial court erred or abused its discretion \r\n  by ordering her to be responsible for all uncovered medical, dental and orthodontic \r\n  expenses. (4) She argues the family court undertook \r\n  to apply the Child Support Guidelines and, thus, should not have deviated from \r\n  them by requiring her to be responsible for the uncovered expenses. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAccording to 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 114-4710(A)(3) (Supp. \r\n  2000), where the combined parental gross income is higher than $15,000.00 per \r\n  month, or $180,000.00 per year, the family court should determine child support \r\n  awards on a case-by-case basis. In this case, the combined gross income of the \r\n  parties is $490,000.00 per year. Thus, the Child Support Guidelines do not cover \r\n  this case. The family court referenced the child support guidelines and concluded, \r\n  by extrapolation, Husband would have been responsible for monthly child support \r\n  of $4,400.00. However, the court determined, based on the equitable division \r\n  award Wife received, Husband should pay only $3,500.00 per month in child support. \r\n  The court further ordered \"Husband shall continue to carry medical and dental \r\n  insurance for the benefit of the minor children, but that the Wife shall be \r\n  responsible for all uncovered medical, dental and/or orthodontic expenses of \r\n  the children.\"\r\n\r\nContrary to Wife's assertion, the court did not apply the \r\n  Child Support Guidelines. Further, the court properly considered the specific \r\n  facts of this case in determining an appropriate award. The court acted within \r\n  its statutory authority and the overall award was reasonable and equitable. \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error. \r\n\r\n\r\n  C. Alimony and Child Support\r\n\r\n\r\nWife next argues that the issues of alimony and child support \r\n  must be revisited if Husband prevails in his appeal of the apportionment of \r\n  the marital property. Because we have affirmed the family court's apportionment \r\n  of the marital estate, it is not necessary to address this issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n  D. Note and Mortgage\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Wife argues that the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  by not ordering Husband to execute a note and mortgage similar to those provided \r\n  by Husband to his commercial creditors. We find no error. \r\n\r\nFollowing the court's amended final order, Husband filed \r\n  an emergency motion to require the note and mortgage pursuant to the final order \r\n  be executed and recorded, to lift any stay which may exist pertaining to said \r\n  note and mortgage, and for attorneys' fees and costs. However, because notice \r\n  of appeal had already been filed, the family court determined it was without \r\n  jurisdiction to hear the motion. Thus, the last order addressing the issue of \r\n  the note to be executed is the November 3, 1999 order modifying the final order. \r\n  In that order, the court directed the preparation of the note and mortgage by \r\n  \"an independent attorney practiced and well versed in real estate and business \r\n  transactions.\" On the same date, the trial judge notified the parties he had \r\n  chosen Attorney Tom Buist to draft the documents. According to both parties, \r\n  the note and mortgage were never drawn.\r\n\r\nBecause appeal was taken before preparation of the note \r\n  and mortgage, it is impossible to say whether the lower court erred in failing \r\n  to order the execution of the same pursuant to the parties' individual desires. \r\n  Indeed, both parties assert on appeal that the court erred in failing to choose \r\n  the type of note and mortgage they requested; however, we do not yet know if \r\n  the executed documents will comply with their wishes. The court's final order \r\n  on this matter has never been followed, and we cannot find error where there \r\n  is no final determination on the matter. We find the appeal of this issue to \r\n  be premature and therefore remand it to the family court to take the appropriate \r\n  actions necessary to enforce the ordered distribution of the marital estate. \r\n  \r\n\r\nBased upon the foregoing, the decision of the trial court \r\n  is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  Alternatively, Husband requests this \r\n  court approve a mortgage as prepared by Husband's counsel. As is more fully \r\n  discussed in Wife's appeal, we find the issue of the proper form of the mortgage \r\n  should be remanded for consideration by the trial judge pursuant to his November \r\n  3, 1999 order on reconsideration. \r\n 2.  Although the schedule indicates \r\n  it is a 3.03% interest, the parties agree this was error and it was actually \r\n  a 3.33% interest. Following the experts' formula for calculating the value, \r\n  an error in this percentage amount would lower the total value of the limited \r\n  partnership interest ($30,000.00 divided by 3.33% times 24.81% equals $223,513.51). \r\n 3.  As previously noted, the trial court \r\n  found the Olin share remained in King's Courtyard Inn and was not transferred \r\n  to Wentworth Mansion. \r\n 4.  Husband concedes, notwithstanding \r\n  the language of the order making Wife responsible for all uncovered \r\n  medical, dental and orthodontic expenses, Wife would be entitled to seek contribution \r\n  from Husband in the event of some exceptional circumstance resulting in inordinate \r\n  expenses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3417","title":"Hardee v.

We affirm in \r\n  part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nMary Alessandro Hardee (Wife) met Husband while she was \r\n  working for the attorney representing Husband in his second divorce. The two \r\n  began dating, and Wife moved into Husband's home in July 1987. Shortly after \r\n  the couple began living together, Wife reduced her hours at work, sold her home, \r\n  and terminated her car lease.\r\n\r\nIn December 1988, Husband proposed to Wife. Wife accepted, \r\n  and the couple began planning a March wedding. Wife testified that they joked \r\n  about a premarital agreement but that Husband never mentioned having her sign \r\n  one until after he proposed. Around February 1, 1989, Husband presented Wife \r\n  with a premarital agreement. In the draft agreement, each party waived all rights \r\n  to the other's property in the event of divorce, as well as any rights to alimony \r\n  or attorney fees. The agreement also contained a clause providing that Husband \r\n  would pay Wife $3,000 for each year of their marriage should they divorce. Wife \r\n  took the agreement to her attorney, who was also her long-time employer, for \r\n  his review. The attorney and another lawyer in his firm recommended Wife not \r\n  sign it.\r\n\r\nThe parties continued to negotiate. After reviewing the \r\n  final agreement, Wife's attorney again advised her not to sign. He testified \r\n  that he thought the agreement was unfair and that he told her it was a \"terrible \r\n  agreement,\" considering her health problems and she would be \"left out in the \r\n  cold\" if the marriage failed. (1) Wife testified \r\n  that she was represented by an attorney when the agreement was executed and \r\n  that he fully explained the agreement's terms to her.\r\n\r\nDespite Wife's attorney's advice, the parties executed an agreement on February 22, 1989,\r\nproviding: \"That each party, in the event of separation or divorce, shall have no right against the\r\nother by way of claims for support, alimony, attorney's fees, costs, or division of property, except\r\nas specifically stated hereinafter.\"  The agreement also required Husband to pay Wife $5,000 for\r\neach year of their marriage and $2,000 for moving expenses on separation.  Husband and Wife\r\neach completed financial statements which were attached to the agreement.  At that time,\r\nHusband's assets totaled $1,536,642, and Wife showed assets of $48,200.\r\n\r\nFollowing the wedding, Husband continued working as the owner of Hardee Construction\r\nCompany, and Wife worked part time as a paralegal until 1991 when she and Husband bought a\r\ndiet business for her to operate.  In 1993, the parties sold the business, and Wife did not work\r\noutside the home for the rest of the marriage.\r\n\r\nWife alleged Husband abused her physically and emotionally.  She testified to several incidents,\r\nincluding an evening when Husband allegedly hit her in the eye with his fist.  Husband denied that\r\nhe physically abused Wife and maintained that her eye injury resulted from a collision with a door\r\nframe.  Wife also contended Husband committed adultery.  In 1990, a young woman and her\r\nhusband confronted Wife and accused Husband of having an affair with the young woman.  In\r\nJune 1995, Wife learned Husband was having another affair.  Wife confronted Husband about the\r\nrelationship, and Husband left the marital home.  He admitted to the affair and continued the\r\nrelationship after the parties separated.\r\n\r\nWife commenced this action seeking a divorce from Husband on the ground of adultery, spousal\r\nsupport, equitable apportionment of property, restraining orders, and attorney fees.  Husband filed\r\na motion to dismiss, an answer and counterclaim, and a motion for temporary relief.  He asserted\r\nthat the premarital agreement divested the family court of subject matter jurisdiction and barred\r\nWife's claims.  A temporary hearing was held and the family court issued an order granting Wife\r\nexclusive use of the marital home, the use of a car, and requiring Husband to pay Wife's health\r\ninsurance premiums and $20,000. (2)  The order also reserved jurisdiction to determine the validity\r\nof the parties' premarital agreement.\r\n\r\nOn Husband's motion, the family court bifurcated the issues \r\n  in this action. An initial hearing was held to determine the impact of the premarital \r\n  agreement. The family court found the provisions of the agreement relating to \r\n  grounds for divorce void, the provisions waiving alimony and attorney fees invalid \r\n  if found unconscionable at the time of enforcement in the later divorce hearing, \r\n  and the provision regarding equitable division invalid with respect to property \r\n  acquired during the marriage. The order reserved jurisdiction to determine alimony, \r\n  equitable division, and attorney fees.\r\n\r\nThe family court then heard the case on its merits and issued \r\n  a final decree and judgment of divorce for Wife on the statutory ground of adultery. \r\n  Additionally, the order declared that the waivers of spousal support and attorney \r\n  fees were unconscionable and void and that the agreement did not bar equitable \r\n  division of property acquired during the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe family court found Wife totally disabled and unable \r\n  to support herself and awarded her permanent periodic alimony of $4,250 per \r\n  month. The order contemplated that Wife would pay her health insurance premiums \r\n  from the alimony award. The family court ordered that property acquired by the \r\n  parties during the marriage be divided with Husband receiving 70% of the assets \r\n  and Wife receiving 30%. Lastly, the family court awarded Wife $85,000 in attorney \r\n  fees and $15,000 in accounting fees.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts \r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford \r\n  v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); Owens v. \r\n  Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996). However, \r\n  this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family court's \r\n  findings. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, \r\n  617 (1981). Nor do we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign \r\n  comparative weight to their testimony. Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. \r\n  524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Equitable Distribution of Property\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding the premarital \r\n  agreement did not bar the equitable division of property acquired by the parties \r\n  during the marriage. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe premarital agreement contains the following provisions \r\n  governing the disposition of property:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. That all properties of any kind or nature, real, personal \r\n    or mixed, wheresoever the same may be located, which belongs to each party, \r\n    shall be and forever remain the personal estate of the said party, including \r\n    all interest, rents, and properties which may accrue therefrom unless \r\n    otherwise so stated in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. That each party, in the event of separation or divorce, \r\n    shall have no right against the other by way of claims for support, alimony, \r\n    attorney fees, cost, or division of property, except as specifically stated \r\n    hereinafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n  7. It is specifically understood and agreed that should \r\n    a separation or divorce occur between the parties, each of the parties would \r\n    maintain all of their property as if the marriage had never occurred and each \r\n    of the parties will have no interest whatsoever in the property of the other \r\n    except as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n  9. The provisions contained herein shall in no \r\n    way affect the property, whether real, personal or mixed which shall be acquired \r\n    by the parties, whether titled separately or jointly, subsequent to the date \r\n    of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n  10. . . . Each party acknowledges that they shall have no \r\n    right against the other by way of claim for support, alimony, attorney fees, \r\n    costs or division of property, except as stated within this agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHusband argues that paragraph 9 applies exclusively to property \r\n  that he and Wife purchased jointly and that the agreement prevented the property \r\n  in question from being classified as marital property subject to equitable division. \r\n  Wife argues paragraph 9 indicates that all property acquired during the marriage \r\n  is subject to equitable division, irrespective of title.\r\n\r\nMarital property is defined as \"all real and personal property \r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage. . . .\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2000). This definition is subject to several exceptions, \r\n  including \"property excluded by written contract of the parties.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(4) (Supp. 2000). Therefore, we must look to the agreement to \r\n  determine whether the family court properly determined the property acquired \r\n  during this marriage was marital. \r\n\r\nQuestions of construction, operation, and effect of domestic \r\n  agreements are decided using the same rules as other contracts. See Henderson \r\n  v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 193, 379 S.E.2d 125, 127 (1989) (finding that \r\n  interpretation of separation agreements is \"governed by the same general rules \r\n  and provisions applicable to other contracts\"). In construing a contract, \"the \r\n  court must first look to its language - if the language is perfectly plain and \r\n  capable of legal construction, it alone determines the document's force and \r\n  effect.\" Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001). Moreover, this court must consider the contract in its entirety \r\n  and employ a construction that gives effect \"to the whole instrument and to \r\n  each of its various parts and provisions. . . .\" Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. \r\n  Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 349 (1976). We find the \r\n  language of paragraph 9 plainly and unambiguously carves out an exception to \r\n  the limitations imposed in paragraphs 1, 4, 7, and 10 and allows the equitable \r\n  division of property acquired during the marriage. The agreement when read as \r\n  a whole consistently contemplates that the onerous provisions relied on by Husband \r\n  may be limited as provided within the agreement. Accordingly, we hold the premarital \r\n  agreement did not bar Wife from receiving an equitable division of property \r\n  acquired during the marriage, and we affirm the family court's award.\r\n\r\nII. Waiver of Alimony and Attorney \r\n  Fees in the Premarital Agreement\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding the waivers \r\n  of alimony and attorney fees were void and unconscionable. \r\n  (3) We agree.  (4)\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the validity of antenuptial agreements \r\n  \"if made voluntarily and in good faith and if fair and equitable.\" Stork \r\n  v. First Nat'l Bank of S.C., 281 S.C. 515, 516, 316 S.E.2d 400, 401 (1984). \r\n  These agreements are \"not opposed to public policy but are highly beneficial \r\n  to serving the best interest of the marriage relationship.\" Id. Additionally, \r\n  our supreme court has held that parties may waive alimony in separation agreements. \r\n  Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983). \"The \r\n  parties may specifically agree that the amount of alimony may not ever be modified \r\n  by the court; they may contract out of any continuing judicial supervision of \r\n  their relationship by the court; . . . they may agree to any terms they wish \r\n  as long as the court deems the contract to have been entered fairly, voluntarily, \r\n  and reasonably.\" Id. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627. Although our courts have \r\n  provided this broad language, no South Carolina authority directly addresses \r\n  whether parties may waive alimony or attorney fees in premarital agreements. \r\n  (5)\r\n\r\nIn the absence of South Carolina authority on point, we \r\n  find it helpful to look to other jurisdictions for guidance. The current trend \r\n  and majority rule allows parties to prospectively contract to limit or eliminate \r\n  spousal support. See generally Pendleton v. Fireman, 5 P.3d 839, \r\n  845-46 (Cal. 2000); Allison A. Marston, Planning for Love: The Politics of \r\n  Premarital Agreements, 49 Stan. L. Rev. 887, 897-99 (1997). But see \r\n  Connolly v. Connolly, 270 N.W.2d 44, 46 (S.D. 1978) (finding waiver of \r\n  spousal support unenforceable and contrary to public policy).\r\n\r\nTwenty-six jurisdictions have adopted all or a substantial \r\n  portion of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (UPA). Unif. Premarital Agreement \r\n  Act, 9B U.L.A. 369 (Supp. 2001). (6) The \r\n  UPA expressly allows parties to contract with respect to the modification or \r\n  elimination of spousal support. Id. at Â§ 3(a)(4). The UPA further provides: \r\n  \"If the provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support \r\n  and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be \r\n  eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation \r\n  or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, \r\n  may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid \r\n  that eligibility.\" UPA Â§ 6 (b). California, New Mexico, and South Dakota adopted \r\n  the UPA without the provision authorizing the modification or elimination of \r\n  spousal support. Id.; see also Pendleton, 5 P.3d at 845-846 \r\n  n. 9,11.\r\n\r\nMany jurisdictions that have not adopted the UPA have found \r\n  such waivers valid and enforceable under certain circumstances. See Robert \r\n  Roy, Enforceability of Premarital Agreements Governing Support or Property \r\n  Rights Upon Divorce or Separation as Affected by Fairness or Adequacy of Those \r\n  Terms - Modern Status, 53 A.L.R. 4th 161 (1987 &amp; Supp. 2000); \r\n  see also Pendleton, 5 P.3d at 846 n.11 (surveying case law from \r\n  other jurisdictions addressing spousal support waivers); Cary v. Cary, \r\n  937 S.W.2d 777, 779 (Tenn. 1996) (recognizing the majority rule is to uphold \r\n  the validity of provisions in antenuptial agreements waiving or limiting alimony). \r\n  Generally, a waiver of spousal support in a premarital agreement will be enforced \r\n  unless the court finds the waiver unconscionable. We find the majority position \r\n  best comports with the language in Stork and hold that antenuptial provisions \r\n  waiving alimony and attorney fees are not per se void as against public policy.\r\n\r\nAmong states that have not adopted the UPA but do allow \r\n  waivers of spousal support and attorney fees, a common framework for analyzing \r\n  prenuptial agreements has arisen. See Scherer v. Scherer, 292 \r\n  S.E.2d 662, 666 (Ga. 1982) (finding in jurisdictions that enforce antenuptial \r\n  agreements, these contracts \"should not be given carte-blanche enforcement\"). \r\n  The test to determine whether such a provision should be enforced has three \r\n  prongs: \"(1) [W]as the agreement obtained through fraud, duress, or mistake, \r\n  or through misrepresentation or nondisclosure of material facts? (2) [I]s the \r\n  agreement unconscionable? (3) Have the facts and circumstances changed since \r\n  the agreement was executed, so as to make its enforcement unfair and unreasonable?\" \r\n  Id., cited with approval in Brooks v. Brooks, 733 P.2d \r\n  1044, 1049 (Alaska 1987); Gentry v. Gentry, 798 S.W.2d 928, 936 (Ky. \r\n  1990); Rinvelt v. Rinvelt, 475 N.W.2d 478, 482 (Mich. Ct. App. 1991). \r\n  We believe this test respects the parties' freedom to contract while allowing \r\n  the family court to refuse to enforce the agreement if equity so requires and \r\n  apply it to our analysis here.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first prong, no party has alleged Wife \r\n  signed under fraud or duress, and the record is clear that the parties had full \r\n  and fair financial disclosure and both were represented by counsel. The second \r\n  element has been hotly contested during this litigation. &quot;Unconscionability \r\n  has been recognized as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party \r\n  due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so oppressive \r\n  that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would \r\n  accept them.\" Fanning v. Fritz's Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, Inc., 322 S.C. \r\n  399, 403, 472 S.E.2d 242, 245 (1996). In determining unconscionability, courts \r\n  are limited to considering facts and circumstances existing when the contract \r\n  was executed. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 208 (1981); see \r\n  also Lackey v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 330 S.C. 388, 397, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  898, 903 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"If the court finds that a contract clause was unconscionable \r\n  at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract clause \r\n  or limit the application of the unconscionable clause to avoid any unconscionable \r\n  result.\"). We find the family court erred in considering facts and circumstances \r\n  existing at the time of enforcement in assessing unconscionability. However, \r\n  we agree with the family court's determination that Wife was not threatened \r\n  or coerced to sign the agreement and she received sufficient legal advice and \r\n  financial disclosure to make a reasonable and informed decision about the agreement. \r\n  She had time to read the agreement, negotiated some of its terms, and had it \r\n  reviewed more than once by an attorney. In addition, although the parties had \r\n  vastly different financial resources, the agreement bound each party equally. \r\n  Therefore, we find the clauses in question were not unconscionable at the time \r\n  the agreement was executed.\r\n\r\nWe now shift our analysis to whether the facts and circumstances \r\n  at the time of enforcement had changed such that it was unfair or unreasonable \r\n  to enforce the agreement. At the time Wife signed the agreement, she had serious \r\n  health problems, including diabetes and sponge kidney disease. The premarital \r\n  agreement specifically noted Wife's health problems. It was completely foreseeable \r\n  to Wife that her health would worsen. Wife's attorney advised Wife not to sign \r\n  the agreement because of her health problems. Although it is unfortunate that \r\n  Wife's health has deteriorated, we do not find that fact alone sufficient to \r\n  justify nullifying a contract Wife freely and voluntarily signed, fully aware \r\n  that under its terms she would not receive any spousal support. Under these \r\n  circumstances, we decline to find that the waiver of alimony was unenforceable \r\n  and reverse the family court's support award. (7) \r\n  \r\n\r\nWe find that the same analysis applies to waivers of attorney \r\n  fees. This court has previously held that despite the general rule that attorney \r\n  fees are within the discretion of the family court, if an agreement is \"clear \r\n  and capable of legal construction, the court's only function is to interpret \r\n  its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties as found within the agreement \r\n  and give effect to them.\" Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d \r\n  271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997). (8) Because we find \r\n  the agreement and its provisions were enforceable, we reverse the family court's \r\n  award of attorney and accounting fees.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find that Wife waived all rights to alimony and attorney \r\n  fees by operation of the premarital agreement. Therefore, the family court erred \r\n  in awarding her alimony and attorney fees and accounting costs. However, we \r\n  find that the premarital agreement does not bar equitable division of property \r\n  acquired during the marriage and that the family court properly divided the \r\n  marital estate.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n1. Before marrying Husband, Wife suffered \r\n  from diabetes and sponge kidney disease. Wife's health has continued to deteriorate. \r\n  At the time of the divorce proceedings, Wife used an insulin pump to control \r\n  her diabetes, and her primary physician had treated her for a variety of medical \r\n  problems including diabetic mellitus, chest pain, anxiety, and diabetic neuropathy. \r\n  Wife's physician also testified that Wife suffers from systemic lupus and cannot \r\n  engage in gainful employment. \r\n2. The relief awarded at the temporary \r\n  hearing was not appealed. \r\n3. We note that the agreement contained \r\n  a severability clause; therefore, the family court could find certain provisions \r\n  unenforceable while upholding the agreement as a whole. \r\n4. Husband also argues the family court's \r\n  finding that the provisions of the premarital agreement waiving alimony and \r\n  attorney fees were unconscionable, constituted gender bias, and violated his \r\n  constitutional rights to equal protection. He further asserts that by treating \r\n  the premarital contract differently than a commercial contract, the family court \r\n  violated his equal protection rights by affording different treatment to his \r\n  contract than would be afforded to the contract of an unmarried person. We disagree. \r\n  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination \r\n  based upon gender and provides that people be treated alike under similar circumstances \r\n  and conditions. U.S. Const. amend XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3. Here, the \r\n  family court did not base its findings on gender but rather on theories of law \r\n  that apply equally to men and women, married and unmarried. \r\n 5. There are South Carolina cases mentioning \r\n  waivers of support or attorney fees; however, in these cases, the enforcement \r\n  of the agreement has not been at issue on appeal. See Gilley v. Gilley, \r\n  327 S.C. 8, 488 S.E.2d 310 (1997) (finding jurisdiction over property claims \r\n  between former spouses who waived equitable division in antenuptial agreement \r\n  was in circuit court); Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 490 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997) (addressing attorney fees and property division pursuant to uncontested \r\n  prenuptial agreement). In determining the waivers were against public policy, \r\n  the family court relied in part on Towles v. Towles, 256 S.C. 307, 312, \r\n  182 S.E.2d 53, 55 (1971) (finding an agreement relieving the husband of his \r\n  support obligation as a condition of continuing the marital relationship was \r\n  void as against public policy) and Crawford v. Crawford, 301 S.C. 476, \r\n  482, 392 S.E.2d 675, 679 (Ct. App. 1990) (\"[T]he public policy of this state \r\n  recognizes the reconciliation of the parties nullified the provisions of the \r\n  separation and reconciliation agreements regarding the parties' agreements not \r\n  to be liable for the support of each other.\"). We find the family court's reliance \r\n  on these authorities is misplaced. Unlike this case, Towles and Crawford \r\n  involved attempts to enforce reconciliation agreements made in contemplation \r\n  of a continuing marital relationship. The \"general law in South Carolina, is \r\n  that, at least as to matters of support, a separation agreement is annulled \r\n  by the reconciliation of the parties.\" Bourne v. Bourne, 336 S.C. 642, \r\n  646, 521 S.E.2d 519, 521 (Ct. App. 1999). Nothing in Towles or Crawford \r\n  suggests that the same policy considerations applicable to reconciliation agreements \r\n  also apply to premarital agreements, and we decline to so hold. \r\n6. We note that legislation to adopt \r\n  the UPA has been introduced to but not passed by the South Carolina General \r\n  Assembly. See Roy T. Stuckey &amp; F. Glenn Smith, Marital Litigation in \r\n  South Carolina Substantive Law 678 (2nd ed. 1997). \r\n 7. Because we reverse the family court's \r\n  finding that the waiver of alimony was unenforceable, we need not reach Husband's \r\n  argument that Wife is capable of working. Were we to reach the issue, we would \r\n  uphold the family court's finding based on the testimony of Doctors Lilavivat \r\n  and Brandt. If the agreement were unenforceable, we would also affirm the amount \r\n  of the family court's awards of alimony and attorney fees and costs. \r\n8. As noted previously, neither party \r\n  in Bowen contested the enforceability of the antenuptial agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3418","title":"Hedgepath v.

Based upon the statute, the trial court granted summary \r\njudgment to the defendants in the Banyard case. The court denied AT&amp;T \r\nNassau Metals Corporation's (\"Nassau\") motion for summary judgment in Hedgepath \r\nand Sharpe. Cross appeals were filed. We affirm the decision of the trial \r\ncourt in Banyard. However, we decline to rule whether the trial court properly \r\ndenied summary judgment in the Hedgepath and Sharpe cases. \r\n\r\n    THE BANYARD APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Background of the Case\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July 1985, 271 individuals living in the Gaston and Swansea \r\n  areas of South Carolina instituted several actions in state court claiming personal \r\n  injury, property damage, and nuisance allegedly caused by pollution from a secondary \r\n  copper reclamation facility constructed and operated by Nassau. These actions \r\n  were commonly referred to as the Baughman litigation. \r\n  (2) See Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 \r\n  S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991). \r\n\r\nAfter approximately eight years of litigation, the parties \r\n  in Baughman reached a settlement in August 1993. News of the settlement \r\n  was reported by the media. Shortly thereafter, a motion to \r\n  intervene in the Baughman litigation was filed by approximately 400 individuals. \r\n  In the motion, the prospective intervenors asserted they also lived in the area \r\n  near the reclamation facility and had claims similar to the Baughman \r\n  plaintiffs. The motion stated, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nIntervenor Plaintiffs believed until September 1, 1993 and September 2, 1993, that they were included in this action in a\r\nmanner that the instant cases protected their interests and injuries and reasonably relied upon that belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prospective intervenors submitted verified affidavits in support of the motion to intervene.  Each affidavit was identical\r\nand contained the following statements:\r\n\r\n\r\nA Petition was circulated protesting the activities of the Defendant AT&amp;T at its Nassau plant in the above entitled action\r\nand I was advised that all our interests would thereby be protected regardless of whether I signed the Petition.\r\n\r\nI believed that my interests were protected in this action until September 1, 1993, when my counsel I retained on that date\r\nadvised me that my interests were not going to be protected despite my belief to the contrary and my reliance on that belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hearing was held in state court on the motion to intervene and the motion was denied.\r\n\r\nIn September 1993, the Banyard plaintiffs \r\n  (3) instituted an action in federal court against Nassau and the Gaston \r\n  Copper Recycling Corporation (\"Gaston Copper\"). (4) \r\n  In October 1996, an order was issued by the federal district court, \r\n  which granted the defendants' motions to dismiss all federal claims \r\n  and dismissed the pendent state claims without prejudice.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the federal court dismissal, the Banyard \r\n  plaintiffs filed an action in state court in November 1996. The \r\n  complaint alleged causes of action for negligence, trespass, nuisance, and strict \r\n  liability. Nassau and Gaston Copper filed answers denying the material allegations \r\n  of the complaint and asserting the statute of limitations as an affirmative \r\n  defense. A complex case order was entered and a case management order held the \r\n  initial proceedings would be limited to a determination of whether the plaintiffs' \r\n  claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nFollowing a discovery period, Nassau and Gaston Copper filed \r\n  motions for summary judgment on the statute of limitations defense. The motions \r\n  were opposed by the Banyard plaintiffs. \r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court judge issued an order granting \r\n  the summary judgment motions of Nassau and Gaston Copper. The court found the \r\n  Banyard plaintiffs were on notice that a claim against Nassau either \r\n  did exist or might have existed before September 1987. The court's order states, \r\n  in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The record reflects that Plaintiffs were aware of facts \r\n    and circumstances more than six years before they commenced suit that a claim \r\n    for property damage might exist.[ (5)] Many \r\n    of the Plaintiffs were noticing problems about the plant by the late 1970s \r\n    â€¦. By the mid-1980s, there was widespread concern over the potential harm \r\n    the Nassau facility's operation was or might be causing to residents in the \r\n    area. There were community forums, town meetings, government involvement, \r\n    local political debates, door-to-door communications, media coverage, grassroots \r\n    organization initiated by local citizens groups, and lawsuits brought by hundreds \r\n    of residents, such as the Baughman litigation.\r\n\r\n  The record reflects that the Baughman plaintiffs, \r\n    who sued in 1985, were friends, neighbors, and, in many instances, relatives \r\n    of Plaintiffs in the present action â€¦. Many of the current Plaintiffs worked \r\n    at the facility or had family members who did. Plaintiffs do not dispute that \r\n    they were on notice of community concerns and allegations that the plant was \r\n    the alleged source of personal injury and property damage in the surrounding \r\n    area.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  When Plaintiffs sought to intervene in Baughman, \r\n    each Plaintiff filed in support of his or her Motion an affidavit. (footnote \r\n    omitted). These affidavits affirm that Plaintiffs knew as early as 1985 of \r\n    the alleged problems concerning the Nassau facility and felt that they had \r\n    claims arising out of Nassau's operation of the facility for injuries to their \r\n    person and property. This conclusion is supported by Plaintiffs' admissions \r\n    that they assumed they were parties in Baughman, that their interests \r\n    (i.e. injuries) were protected in Baughman, and that they did nothing \r\n    to pursue those claims until they read about the Baughman settlement \r\n    in The State in August 1993.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  Plaintiffs' [discovery] admissions confirm they knew or \r\n    should have known of facts sufficient to trigger the running of the statute \r\n    [of limitations]. Plaintiffs admitted in their discovery responses that they \r\n    observed emissions from the plant prior to 1987, that they became aware of \r\n    community concern, discussions, and reaction to the Nassau facility prior \r\n    to 1987, that they participated in such meetings and discussions prior to \r\n    1987, that they believed their injuries to their persons or property occurred \r\n    prior to 1987, and that they were aware of the Baughman litigation \r\n    prior to 1987 and felt their interests were protected during that litigation \r\n    . . . . Plaintiffs have not disputed these findings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court also concluded there was no basis to apply \r\n  the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The court found there were insufficient \r\n  facts to support a claim that the statute of limitations should be tolled based \r\n  upon the alleged \"active concealment\" of the Dames &amp; Moore Report from the \r\n  public. This was a private environmental report prepared for \r\n  Gaston Copper in relation to the sale of the plant by Nassau to it. \r\n  Gaston Copper later provided a copy of this report to the South Carolina \r\n  Tax Commission in support of a challenge to the Commission's property assessment \r\n  for the reclamation facility. Portions of this report were publicly released \r\n  in 1994 after a Freedom of Information Act request led to a declaratory judgment \r\n  action. See South Carolina Tax Comm'n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., \r\n  316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994).\r\n\r\nII.  Issues\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in granting summary judgment to Nassau and Gaston Cooper because it:\r\n\r\n\r\n  abused its discretion in limiting discovery on the statute of limitations issue;\r\n    \r\n  misapplied the summary judgment burden of proof standard;\r\n    \r\n  misinterpreted the evidence as to each cause of action pled by the plaintiffs; and\r\n    \r\n  failed to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine.\r\n\r\nIII.  Law/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Limitation of Discovery\r\n\r\n\r\nThese cases were designated complex litigation and assigned to one circuit court judge.  The parties consented to a case\r\nmanagement order that limited the initial phase of the proceedings to the statute of limitations issue.  Discovery was\r\nspecifically limited to that issue.\r\n\r\nDuring the discovery phase, the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel against Nassau and Gaston Copper based upon\r\nobjections filed by the defendants to interrogatories and requests for production.  Essentially, the defendants  objected to\r\nthe requested discovery on the ground it exceeded the case management order and was directed toward the merits of the\r\ncase, not the statute of limitations issue.  The trial court agreed and denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel.\r\n\r\nThe rulings of a trial judge in matters involving discovery \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. \r\n  Bayle v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001), cert. denied. An abuse of discretion occurs when there \r\n  is no evidence to support the trial judge's factual conclusion or when the ruling \r\n  is based upon an error of law. Id.  \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs contend the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing (1) depositions of defendants' personnel familiar\r\nwith plant operations; (2) discovery of FBI information on plant operations; (3) discovery of company production data; and\r\n(4) production of confidential portions of the Dames &amp; Moore Report.  We agree with the trial court's conclusion that this\r\ninformation may have been relevant to the merits of the case, but it was not relevant to the question of when the plaintiffs\r\nknew, or should have known, that they might have had a cause of action against the defendants.  Accordingly, we find no\r\nabuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nB.  Summary Judgment and the Statute of Limitations\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Banyard plaintiffs alleged causes of action for \r\n  negligence, trespass, nuisance, and strict liability. The trial court granted \r\n  the defense motions for summary judgment as to all causes of action. It found \r\n  the Banyard plaintiffs were on notice that a claim against Nassau either \r\n  did exist or might have existed before September 1987 (i.e., for those \r\n  plaintiffs who originally filed their claims in federal court in 1993) or before \r\n  November 1993 (i.e., for those plaintiffs who originally filed their \r\n  claims in state court on November 13, 1996). With respect to Gaston Copper, \r\n  the court concluded insufficient evidence was presented as to new and different \r\n  injuries to any plaintiff from any alleged wrongdoing after the sale of the \r\n  plant to Gaston Copper in 1990. The court noted that every plaintiff who was \r\n  asked confirmed that he or she was claiming the same injuries against all defendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Summary Judgment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment under \r\n  the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP. Baughman \r\n  v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991).\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \r\n  law. Bayle, 344 S.C. at 119, 542 S.E.2d at 738 (Ct. App. 2001); Young \r\n  v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999); see also Bruce v. Durney, 341 S.C. 563, 534 S.E.2d \r\n  720 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding a motion for summary judgment shall be granted \r\n  if pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, \r\n  together with affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law). \r\n\r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary judgment \r\n  has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact.  Baughman, 306 S.C. at 115, 410 S.E.2d at 545. With respect to \r\n  an issue upon which the nonmoving party has the burden of proof, this initial \r\n  responsibility may be discharged by pointing out to the trial court that there \r\n  is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id. \r\n  (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. \r\n  Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the \"opposing \r\n  party must, under Rule 56(e), 'do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical \r\n  doubt as to the material facts' but 'must come forward with specific facts showing \r\n  that there is a genuine issue for trial.'\" Id. \r\n  (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. \r\n  574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)) (emphasis in original). \r\n  The party opposing summary judgment cannot simply rest on mere allegations or \r\n  denials contained in the pleadings. Id.; George v. Empire Fire &amp; \r\n  Marine Ins. Co., 344 S.C. 582, 545 S.E.2d 500 (2001).\r\n\r\nIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, \r\n  the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Vermeer Carolina's, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999). If triable issues exist, those issues must be submitted to the jury. \r\n  Young, 333 S.C. at 718, 511 S.E.2d at 415. \r\n\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry \r\n  into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. \r\n  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000). \r\n  Summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary \r\n  facts if there is disagreement concerning the conclusion to be drawn from those \r\n  facts. Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 \r\n  S.E.2d 672 (2000). However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist \r\n  on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. \r\n  Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Statute of Limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the former Â§ 15-3-530, plaintiffs alleging property \r\n  damage or personal injury were required to bring suit within six (6) years from \r\n  when the cause of action arose. By a 1988 act of the General Assembly, this \r\n  time period was shortened to three years for causes of action arising or accruing \r\n  on or after April 5, 1988. See Annotation, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 \r\n  (Supp. 2000) (referencing Act No. 432, 1988 Acts 2891). The causes of action \r\n  articulated by the Banyard plaintiffs arose before 1988. Therefore, in \r\n  our appellate review of the trial judge's summary judgment order, we apply the \r\n  six-year statute of limitations to the dispute. \r\n\r\nThe parties agree the \"discovery rule\" is applicable to \r\n  the statute of limitations question. According to the discovery rule, the statute \r\n  of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have \r\n  been discovered.  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 \r\n  (1996); Bayle v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001), cert. denied. In Dean, the Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  According to the discovery rule, the statute of limitations \r\n    begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered. \r\n    The statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or should have \r\n    known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises \r\n    from the wrongful conduct. We have interpreted the \"exercise of reasonable \r\n    diligence\" to mean that the injured party must act with some promptness where \r\n    the facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common \r\n    knowledge and experience on notice that a claim against \r\n    another party might exist. Moreover, the fact that the injured party may not \r\n    comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 363, 364, 468 S.E.2d at 647 (emphasis in original) \r\n  (citations omitted); Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 \r\n  S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating the statute of limitations \r\n  runs from the date the injured party either knows or should have known by the \r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the wrongful \r\n  conduct). \r\n\r\nThe date on which discovery of the cause of action should \r\n  have been made is an objective, rather than a subjective, question. Joubert \r\n  v. South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000); see also Young, 333 S.C. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416 \r\n  (\"In other words, whether the particular plaintiff actually knew he had a claim \r\n  is not the test. Rather, courts must decide whether the circumstances of the \r\n  case would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some \r\n  right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against another party might \r\n  exist.\").\r\n\r\nReasonable diligence is intrinsically tied to the issue \r\n  of notice. The Joubert Court explicated: \"We have interpreted the 'exercise \r\n  of reasonable diligence' to mean that the injured party must act with some promptness \r\n  where the facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of \r\n  common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim against another party \r\n  might exist.\" Id. at 191, 534 S.E.2d at 8 (quoting Dean v. Ruscon Corp., \r\n  321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996)); see also Wiggins v. \r\n  Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994) (stating the exercise of reasonable \r\n  diligence means simply that the injured party must act with some promptness \r\n  where facts and circumstances of injury would put a person of common knowledge \r\n  and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some \r\n  claim against another party might exist; statute of limitations begins to run \r\n  from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or full-blown theory \r\n  of recovery is developed) (citation omitted). \r\n\r\n\r\n    Continuing Trespass or Nuisance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Banyard plaintiffs contend the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to Nassau and Gaston Copper because the court did \r\n  not recognize that their claims involved ongoing misconduct and contamination. \r\n  They also argue their damages are both abatable and permanent. \r\n\r\nIn order to attack the statute of limitations defense, the \r\n  plaintiffs seek to bring their property damage claims within the rubric of a \r\n  continuing trespass or nuisance. Under South Carolina law, the distinction between \r\n  trespass and nuisance is that \"trespass is any intentional invasion of the plaintiff's \r\n  interest in the exclusive possession of his property, whereas nuisance is a \r\n  substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment \r\n  of his property.\" Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, \r\n  286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. denied (citing Ravan \r\n  v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 434 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1993)). A nuisance \r\n  may be classified as continuing or permanent. Id.\r\n\r\nA continuing nuisance is defined as a nuisance that is intermittent \r\n  or periodical. Id. It is described as one which occurs so often that \r\n  it is said to be continuing although it is not necessarily constant or unceasing. \r\n  Id. A nuisance is continuing if abatement is reasonably and practically \r\n  possible. Id. at 287, 543 S.E.2d at 567. \r\n\r\nA permanent nuisance may be expected to continue but is \r\n  presumed to continue permanently with no possibility of abatement. Id. \r\n  at 286, 543 S.E.2d at 566-67. With respect to a permanent nuisance, the injury \r\n  is fixed and goes to the whole value of the land. Id. at 286, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  at 567.\r\n\r\nAs to the concept of a nuisance and application of the statute \r\n  of limitations, where the nuisance is permanent and only one cause of action \r\n  may be brought for damages, the statute of limitations bars the action if it \r\n  is not brought within the statutory period after the first actionable injury. \r\n   Id. Where the nuisance is deemed to be continuing and is abatable, the \r\n  statute of limitations does not run merely from the original intrusion on the \r\n  property and cannot be a complete bar. Id. A new statute of limitations \r\n  begins to run after each separate invasion of the property. Id.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhere, however, the nuisance is classified as continuing, \r\n  the expiration of the limitations period after the first actionable injury does \r\n  not effect a complete bar as each new injury gives rise to a new cause of action \r\n  and a landowner may at any time recover for an injury to his land which occurred \r\n  within the statutory period. Id. at 287, 543 S.E.2d at 567, cert. \r\n  denied; Cutchin v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., \r\n  301 S.C. 35, 389 S.E.2d 646 (1990); McCurley v. South Carolina State Highway \r\n  Dep't, 256 S.C. 332, 182 S.E.2d 299 (1971); Webb v. Greenwood County, \r\n  229 S.C. 267, 92 S.E.2d 688 (1956).\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs' arguments on common law nuisance obfuscate \r\n  the real issue: when did the plaintiffs know or, by the exercise of reasonable \r\n  diligence, should have known they might have had a claim against someone for \r\n  alleged environmental contamination of their property. Approximately 240 of \r\n  the 278 remaining Banyard plaintiffs submitted affidavits in support \r\n  of the 1993 motion to intervene in the Baughman litigation. By the affidavits, \r\n  those plaintiffs affirmatively stated they believed their interests were being \r\n  protected by the Baughman litigation. They admitted they knew by 1985 \r\n  (i.e., the year the Baughman litigation was filed) that they might \r\n  have a claim against someone for alleged environmental contamination. This is \r\n  an inescapable conclusion. As for the remaining plaintiffs, the trial court \r\n  correctly concluded the record is replete with uncontested evidence of widespread \r\n  publicity and awareness of the alleged contamination prior to 1987. See generally \r\n  United Klans of America v. McGovern, 621 F.2d 152 (5th Cir. 1980) (ruling \r\n  that where events receive widespread publicity, plaintiffs may be charged with \r\n  knowledge of their occurrence).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Nassau ceased refining operations at the facility \r\n  on August 13, 1990, in preparation for the sale to Gaston Copper. Assuming, \r\n  arguendo, that environmental contamination by Nassau continued up to that day, \r\n  the Banyard plaintiffs did not file their federal court action until \r\n  September 1993, which is more than three years after Nassau ceased its operations. \r\n  The plaintiffs' reliance upon Aurora National Bank v. Tri Star Marketing, \r\n  990 F. Supp. 1020 (N.D. Ill. 1998) to argue continuing liability by Nassau is \r\n  misplaced. That case involved an action under the citizen suit provision of \r\n  the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The citizen suit provision allows \r\n  claims by parties acting as private attorneys-general. Id.  \r\n\r\nThe Banyard plaintiffs are actually claiming a single \r\n  indivisible injury to their property for alleged permanent injury by pollution. \r\n  See Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 434 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993) (stating the measure of damages for permanent injury to real property \r\n  by pollution, whether by nuisance, trespass, negligence, or inverse condemnation \r\n  is the diminution in the market value of the property). The trial court granted \r\n  summary judgment to Gaston Copper because insufficient evidence was presented \r\n  as to new and different injuries to any plaintiff from any alleged wrongdoing \r\n  after the sale of the plant to Gaston Copper in 1990. The court noted that every \r\n  plaintiff who was asked confirmed that he or she was claiming the same injuries \r\n  against all defendants. Since the same injuries were claimed, \r\n  the trial court correctly applied the discovery rule when analyzing the application \r\n  of the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, based upon: (1) the uncontested evidence of the \r\n  widespread publicity concerning alleged environmental contamination, (2) the \r\n  affidavits submitted by the vast majority of the Banyard plaintiffs, \r\n  and (3) the permanency of the claimed property damages, the trial court did \r\n  not err in granting summary judgment to the defendants under the statute of \r\n  limitations.\r\n\r\nC.  Equitable Estoppel Doctrine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Banyard plaintiffs argue the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine to the statute of limitations. \r\n  They contend Nassau and Gaston Copper denied allegations of environmental contamination \r\n  and actively concealed the contents of the Dames &amp; Moore Report until 1994. \r\n  On these grounds, the plaintiffs assert the defendants should be estopped from \r\n  relying upon the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a defendant may be estopped from claiming \r\n  the statute of limitations as a defense if some conduct or representation by \r\n  the defendant has induced the plaintiff to delay in filing suit.

Southern R.R., 262 S.C. 590, 206 S.E.2d 882 (1974).\r\n\r\nAn inducement for delay may consist of either an express \r\n  representation that the claim will be settled without litigation or other conduct \r\n  that suggests a lawsuit is not necessary.

However, settlement negotiations which are commenced, but not finalized, \r\n  will not bar assertion of the statute of limitations.

It is sufficient if the plaintiff reasonably relied upon \r\n  the words or conduct of the defendant in allowing the limitations period to \r\n  expire. Dillon County, 286 S.C. at 218-19, 332 S.E.2d at 561; Brown, \r\n  326 S.C. at 419, 483 S.E.2d at 482. Whether the defendant's actions lulled the \r\n  plaintiff into \"a false sense of security\" is usually a question of fact. Dillon \r\n  County, 286 S.C. at 219, 332 S.E.2d at 561. However, summary judgment is \r\n  proper where there is no evidence of conduct on the defendant's part warranting \r\n  estoppel. Vines, 314 S.C. at 309, 443 S.E.2d at 911.\r\n\r\nThe Banyard plaintiffs argue the defendants should \r\n  be equitably estopped from applying the statute of limitations due to their \r\n  silence and failure to disclose the extent of environmental contamination, particularly \r\n  as reflected in the Dames &amp; Moore Report. \"Silence, when it is intended, \r\n  or when it has the effect of misleading a party, may operate as equitable estoppel.\" \r\n  Southern Dev.

Auth., \r\n  311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 751 (1993) (citation omitted). \r\n\r\nThe primary point overlooked by the plaintiffs in their \r\n  estoppel argument is the existence of an underlying duty to speak or disclose. \r\n  As the Supreme Court noted, \"[e]stoppel by silence arises where a person owing \r\n  another a duty to speak refrains from doing so and thereby leads \r\n  the other to believe in the existence of an erroneous state of facts.\" Id. \r\n  (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nA duty to speak or disclose may be found in three distinct scenarios:\r\n\r\n\r\n  where it arises from a preexisting definite fiduciary relation between the parties;\r\n     \r\n\r\n  where one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the other with reference to the particular transaction in\r\nquestion, or else from the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position towards each other,\r\nsuch a trust and confidence in the particular case is necessarily implied; and\r\n    \r\n\r\n  where the very contract or transaction itself, in its essential nature, is intrinsically fiduciary and necessarily calls for\r\nperfect good faith and full disclosure without regard to any particular intention of the parties.  \r\n\r\n\r\nJacobson v. Yaschik, 249 S.C. 577, 155 S.E.2d 601 \r\n  (1967); Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Serv. Inc., 338 S.C. 572, \r\n  527 S.E.2d 371 (Ct. App. 2000), affirmed as modified and remanded, 343 \r\n  S.C. 587, 541 S.E.2d 257 (2001).\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no factual basis to find a duty to \r\n  speak or disclose on the part of the defendants. The Dames &amp; Moore Report \r\n  was a privately commissioned report prepared for Gaston Copper in connection \r\n  with the sale by Nassau of the reclamation facility. The Banyard plaintiffs \r\n  have not established a fiduciary or confidential relationship between themselves \r\n  and the defendants that would impose a duty upon the defendants to disclose \r\n  the contents of this private report to the public. Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  did not err in failing to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine in the Banyard \r\n  case.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE HEDGEPATH APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 26, 1996, the Hedgepath complaint was filed \r\n  in state court. The complaint sought recovery for damage to real property based \r\n  upon causes of action for negligence, trespass, nuisance, strict liability, \r\n  and fraud. Nassau and Gaston Copper filed answers denying the \r\n  material allegations of the complaint and asserting the statute of limitations \r\n  as a defense. Pursuant to the complex case management order, \r\n  the initial phase of the litigation was limited to the statute of limitations \r\n  issue.\r\n\r\nFollowing a discovery period, Nassau and Gaston Copper filed \r\n  motions for summary judgment based upon the statute of limitations. \r\n  The Hedgepath plaintiffs opposed the motion. After \r\n  a hearing, the trial court denied Nassau's motion for summary judgment based \r\n  upon the equitable estoppel doctrine. However, the court dismissed Gaston Copper \r\n  from the litigation because it did not have any contact with the Hedgepath family. \r\n  Nassau appeals the denial of its summary judgment motion. \r\n  (6)\r\n\r\nWe must initially determine if this court has subject matter jurisdiction over Nassau's appeal.\r\n\r\nNassau asserts this Court should find it has subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over this appeal because there is an appealable issue before the \r\n  court, i.e., the grant of summary judgment in the Banyard case.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that generally, the denial of a motion for \r\n  summary judgment is not immediately appealable. Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 \r\n  S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994). Our appellate courts, however, have recognized \r\n  an exception to this rule. Specifically, the courts have made a practice of \r\n  accepting appeals of denials of interlocutory orders not ordinarily immediately \r\n  appealable when these appeals are companion to issues that are reviewable.\r\n\r\nOur examination of the case law regarding this exception \r\n  begins with the Supreme Court's agreement to consider an appeal of whether a \r\n  trial court erred in failing to require a party make its complaint more definite \r\n  in Briggs v. Richardson, 273 S.C. 376, 256 S.E.2d 544 (1979). Additionally \r\n  appealed to the Court for its review was an issue of whether the trial court \r\n  erred in overruling the appellant's demurrer. Presented with the question of \r\n  whether to address the denial of the motion for a more definite complaint, the \r\n  Briggs Court pronounced: \"While not normally appealable, [the] issue \r\n  [concerning the motion for a more definite complaint] is before the Court due \r\n  to the appealability of the first issue [regarding the demurrer].\" Id. at 379 \r\n  n.1, 256 S.E.2d at 546 n.1 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nThis Court has taken a concordant view concerning the propriety of reviewing interlocutory orders not ordinarily\r\nimmediately appealable.\r\n\r\nIn Garrett v. Snedigar, 293 S.C. 176, 359 S.E.2d \r\n  283 (Ct. App. 1987), partners in a real estate venture brought an action for \r\n  fraud, breach of contract, and violations of the South Carolina Uniform Securities \r\n  Act against the organizer, a construction company, and an investment advisor \r\n  who was retained to market the partnership. The investment advisor was also \r\n  sued for negligence. The Circuit Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary \r\n  judgment, which concerned the issue of whether their interests in the partnership \r\n  were securities. The trial court additionally granted the plaintiffs' motion \r\n  to amend their cause of action for negligence and denied the investment advisor's \r\n  summary judgment motion pertaining to this claim. On appeal, the investment \r\n  advisor argued,  inter alia, the trial court erred in acting on the plaintiffs' \r\n  motion to amend without holding a hearing separate from his motion for summary \r\n  judgment. In response, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  An interlocutory appeal of this issue â€¦ is not normally \r\n    allowed. See Davis-McGee Mule Co. v. Marett, 129 S.C. 36, 37, \r\n    123 S.E. 323, 323 (1924) (\"No appeal can be made except from a final judgment.\"). \r\n    An order denying summary judgment cannot be appealed, even after trial. Holloman \r\n    v. McAllister, 289 S.C. 183, 345 S.E.2d 728 (1986). However, \r\n    these issues are properly before us because the issue of whether the Circuit \r\n    Court erred in granting the motion of the plaintiffs for partial summary judgment \r\n    is appealable. See Briggs v. Richardson, 273 S.C. 376, 379, 256 S.E.2d 544, \r\n    546 (1979) (\"While not normally appealable, this issue is before the Court \r\n    due to the appealability of the first issue.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 183 n.2, 359 S.E.2d at 287 n.2 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nNumerous reviews of denials of summary judgment motions \r\n  have occurred since Garrett. See Anthony v. Padmar, Inc., \r\n  307 S.C. 503, 415 S.E.2d 828 (Ct. App. 1992),  cited in  4 Am. Jur. 2d \r\n  Appellate Review Â§ 170 (1995) (in a case where opposing motions for summary \r\n  judgment resulted in the trial court granting one and denying the other, the \r\n  Court of Appeals held the party whose motion was denied may have the denial \r\n  reviewed on the appeal because the question of whether the trial court erred \r\n  in granting the other motion was appealable); Pruitt v. Bowers, 330 S.C. \r\n  483, 488, 499 S.E.2d 250, 253 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"[Respondent/Appellant] argues \r\n  the trial court erred in granting [Appellant/Respondent's] motion to amend her \r\n  complaint. [Appellant/Respondent] responds that the order granting the motion \r\n  is interlocutory and thus not appealable. We agree that under the precedent \r\n  of Briggs v. Richardson â€¦ and Garrett v. Snedigar â€¦ [Respondent/Appellant's] \r\n  appeal of the amendment order is interlocutory and generally not appealable, \r\n  but may be considered by the court because it accompanies the appeal of the \r\n  grant of [Respondent/Appellant's] motion for summary judgment.\"); Tanner \r\n  v. Florence City-County Bldg. Comm'n, 333 S.C. 549, 553, 511 S.E.2d 369, \r\n  371 (Ct. App. 1999) (This Court ruled: \"[A]n order that is not directly appealable \r\n  will be considered if there is an appealable issue before this court.\").\r\n\r\nIn Davis v. Lunceford, 287 S.C. 242, 335 S.E.2d 798 \r\n  (1985), the Supreme Court held reviewing the denial of summary judgment was \r\n  proper to resolve protracted litigation: \"Because of the need for final resolution \r\n  in this [13-year-old medical malpractice] case, we have allowed this direct \r\n  appeal from the lower court's order denying appellant's motion for summary judgment.\"). \r\n   Id. at 243, 335 S.E.2d at 799 (citation omitted). The issue of whether \r\n  the denial was proper was the only one on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe continued viability of Garrett is debatable given \r\n  the recent decisions of Silverman v. Campbell, 326 S.C. 208, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  1 (1997) and Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994).\r\n\r\nIn Ballenger, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court has repeatedly held that the denial of summary judgment is not directly appealable.  Further, this Court has held\r\nthat the denial of summary judgment is not reviewable even in an appeal from final judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 476-77, 443 S.E.2d at 380 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Ballenger Court noted that it is \r\n  \"unnecessary [for the trial judge] to make findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law in denying motions for summary judgment.\"  Id. at 478 n.1, 443 \r\n  S.E.2d at 380 n.1 (citing Rule 52, SCRCP). Thus, there would be no basis on \r\n  which an appellate court could make its review.\r\n\r\nIn Silverman, our Supreme Court refused to consider \r\n  the appellants' claim that the trial court had erred in denying its motion for \r\n  summary judgment, although it did consider another issue raised by appellants \r\n  because it was immediately appealable. Thus, the presence of an immediately \r\n  appealable issue in the order did not make the denial of summary judgment reviewable \r\n  in that instance.  Id. at 211, 486 S.E.2d at 2;  cf. Hollman \r\n  v. McAllister, 289 S.C. 183, 345 S.E.2d 728 (1986) (declining to address \r\n  denial of summary judgment after trial while addressing other appealable issues); \r\n  Davis v. Tripp, 338 S.C. 226, 525 S.E.2d 528 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating \r\n  denial of summary judgment was not reviewable either before or after final judgment).\r\n\r\nSilverman may represent an attempt to curtail Garrett-style \r\n  exceptions, thereby requiring a closer inquiry into their continued viability.\r\n\r\nBecause of the dissonance in the precedent in regard to the appealability of the denial of a motion for summary judgment,\r\nwe decline to address the issue on the merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SHARPE APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1996, Toby Sharpe, a former employee of Nassau and Gaston Copper, filed a complaint against Nassau and\r\nGaston Copper seeking damages for personal injury and property damage. (7)  Sharpe alleged causes of action for\r\nnegligence, trespass, nuisance, and strict liability.  Nassau and Gaston Copper  denied the material allegations of the\r\ncomplaint and asserted the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.  In May 1997, the trial court granted Nassau's\r\nmotion to dismiss Sharpe's claim for personal injury arising out of workplace exposure.  The trial court held Sharpe's\r\nclaims for personal injuries arising out of residential exposure and claims for property damage could be pursued by him.\r\n\r\nNassau and Gaston Copper subsequently filed motions for summary judgment based upon the statute of limitations. \r\nSharpe opposed the motions.  The trial court denied Nassau's motion, concluding that although the statute of limitations\r\nhad expired, Nassau was equitably estopped from asserting the defense.  The trial court granted Gaston Copper's motion\r\nfor summary  judgment concluding Sharpe alleged he developed cancer while working at the plant during the time it was\r\nowned by Nassau.  In a later order on a motion to reconsider, the trial court specifically clarified that Sharpe's claims\r\nagainst Nassau were limited to property damage only.  Nassau appeals the order denying summary judgment.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated in the Hedgepath portion of \r\n  this opinion, we decline to address the merits of Nassau's appeal from the denial \r\n  of summary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the decision of the trial court in the Banyard \r\n  case. However, we decline to address whether the trial court properly denied \r\n  summary judgment in the Hedgepath and Sharpe cases due to the \r\n  discord in the case law concerning the appealability of such orders.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS ADDRESSED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.   The cases were designated complex litigation and assigned to one circuit court judge.\r\n2.  The Baughman litigation was \r\n  not a class action. Counsel for the Baughman plaintiffs had an employment \r\n  contract with each plaintiff. \r\n3.  We recognize that some individuals \r\n  in the federal court litigation may not have been prospective intervenors in \r\n  the Baughman litigation and vice versa. However, for purposes of this \r\n  opinion, use of the term \"the Banyard plaintiffs\" is sufficient. \r\n4.   The facility was sold to Gaston Copper on September 20, 1990.  Nassau ceased refining operations on August 13, 1990,\r\nin preparation for the sale.\r\n5.  All personal injury claims of the \r\n  Banyard plaintiffs were previously dismissed by court order except the \r\n  claim of one individual. \r\n6.  The Hedgepath plaintiffs argue \r\n  in their briefs that the trial court erred in concluding the statute of limitations \r\n  had run prior to the filing of their suit. Because that argument is connected \r\n  to the argument on equitable estoppel, the matters will be addressed together. \r\n7.   Sharpe died during the pendency of this litigation and his personal representative has been substituted as plaintiff by\r\ncourt order. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3419","title":"Martin v.

Willbanks, both of \r\n          Willcox, Buyck &amp; Williams, of Florence, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Douglas N. Truslow, of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:  \r\n  Appellant, John Anderson (Anderson), filed a motion to recover damages under \r\n  a temporary injunction bond. The circuit court found it lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to hear the motion and dismissed the matter. Anderson appeals. \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n Paradise Cove Marina, Inc. (PCM) owned land which \r\n  it planned to develop into a marina. Shareholders of the corporation included \r\n  John Divine (Divine), Anderson, Civil Lou Martin (Mrs. Martin), and others. \r\n  Anderson also formed a separate partnership, JBP, with two other PCM shareholders. \r\n  In 1989 Divine sold his 20,000 shares of PCM stock to JBP, in return for a $100,000 \r\n  note which was due on October 27, 1992 (JBP Note). JBP apparently sold the Divine \r\n  shares back to PCM and took back a $100,000 note, also due on October 27, 1992 \r\n  (PCM Note). Neither note was paid when due, and Divine obtained a judgment against \r\n  JBP on February 4, 1993. Sometime later, JBP offered to assign the PCM Note \r\n  to Divine in satisfaction of his judgment. Divine accepted the PCM Note only \r\n  as additional security for payment of the JBP Note. \r\n\r\n Early in 1994, PCM's shareholders agreed to sell \r\n  PCM's sole substantial asset, the real estate on which the marina was to be \r\n  built, and they later voted to pay the PCM Note out of the proceeds. At a subsequent \r\n  shareholders' meeting, PCM's shareholders rescinded authorization to pay the \r\n  note. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Martin filed an action to prevent payment of the \r\n  PCM Note. They obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting PCM from paying the \r\n  PCM Note out of the proceeds of the real estate sale. The injunction required \r\n  the Martins to provide an injunction bond of $126,250 for the payment of costs \r\n  and damages suffered by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined. Divine, \r\n  an intervening party, moved for summary judgment. The circuit court granted \r\n  the motion for summary judgment and ordered PCM to pay the proceeds from the \r\n  PCM Note to Divine thereby dissolving the temporary injunction. The circuit \r\n  court denied the Martins' motions to vacate or reconsider the order. On appeal, \r\n  this court affirmed the circuit court. Our supreme court denied the petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari. The remittitur was sent to the circuit court on June \r\n  22, 1999. \r\n\r\n On August 9, 1999, Anderson filed a motion, pursuant \r\n  to Rule 65, SCRCP, to recover $500,000 in damages from the injunction bond. \r\n  Anderson alleged lost profits on the sale of property and other damages to his \r\n  business and personal assets resulting from the Divine judgment against him. \r\n  Anderson also asserted he was entitled to costs and attorney fees.\r\n\r\n The Martins moved to dismiss the action for lack \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction. They argued that Anderson had ten days in which \r\n  to move for costs after the circuit court order dissolved the temporary injunction. \r\n  Alternatively, they argued that Anderson had fifteen days after the appellate \r\n  courts ruled in his favor to move for costs pursuant to Rule 222, SCACR. Because \r\n  he did not move for costs after the circuit court's order, nor did he move for \r\n  costs after the South Carolina Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ \r\n  of certiorari, the Martins argued Anderson waived his opportunity to seek costs. \r\n  They further asserted that after the case was remitted to the circuit court \r\n  on June 22, 1999, the case was ended with finality and the circuit court no \r\n  longer had jurisdiction to entertain any matter concerning the case. \r\n\r\n Anderson argued the circuit court did not have \r\n  jurisdiction to entertain a motion for costs after the circuit court granted \r\n  Divine's motion for summary judgment because the Martins filed an appeal. Anderson \r\n  further argued that once the appeal was filed, the appellate courts had jurisdiction \r\n  to consider the entire case, including the validity of the injunction. Anderson \r\n  admitted the dissolution of the injunction was not an issue raised in the original \r\n  appeal by the Martins, but he argued that it would not have been prudent to \r\n  pursue costs from the bond while the rest of the case was before the appellate \r\n  courts. \r\n\r\n The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss \r\n  for lack of jurisdiction. (1) The court found \r\n  (1) Anderson or Divine could have petitioned the circuit court for costs prior \r\n  to the September 28, 1998, Court of Appeals opinion; (2) it had no jurisdiction \r\n  because the matter was remitted, not remanded, to the circuit court; (3) costs \r\n  could have been taxed within fifteen days after entry of the appellate judgment \r\n  pursuant to Rule 222, SCACR; and (4) the doctrine of res judicata applied to \r\n  the action and deprived the court of jurisdiction. Anderson appeals. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal from the grant of a motion to \r\n  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. A question of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction is a question of law for the court.  Woodard v. Westvaco \r\n  Corp., 315 S.C. 329, 332, 433 S.E.2d 890, 892 (Ct. App. 1993), vacated on \r\n  other grounds by 319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In finding that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain \r\n  Anderson's motion for damages under the injunction bond, the circuit court held \r\n  Anderson should have moved for damages under Rule 65(c), SCRCP, during the pendency \r\n  of the appeal or within fifteen days after filing of the appellate judgment \r\n  pursuant to Rule 222(d), SCACR. Anderson argues the circuit court erred in this \r\n  conclusion. We agree.\r\n\r\n Initially, we find the circuit court erred in \r\n  holding Anderson should have moved for costs under the injunction bond within \r\n  fifteen days pursuant to Rule 222, SCACR. Although Rule 222(d) provides that \r\n  a party seeking costs must file a motion with the appellate court within fifteen \r\n  days of the issuance of the remittitur, recovery under the rule is clearly limited \r\n  to costs incurred in pursuing the appeal, such as the filing fee, the cost of \r\n  obtaining the transcript, the cost of printing the Record on Appeal and final \r\n  briefs, and limited attorney fees. \r\n\r\n We likewise find the circuit court erred in concluding \r\n  Anderson's failure to move for damages under Rule 65(c) during the pendency \r\n  of the appeal divested the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction. Rule \r\n  65(c), SCRCP, (2) outlines the procedures for \r\n  temporary injunction bonds. Recovery under an injunction bond is limited to \r\n  costs and damages incurred during the period of the temporary restraining order \r\n  or temporary injunction. See Chambron v. Lost Colony Homeowners Ass'n, \r\n  317 S.C. 43, 45, 451 S.E.2d 410, 411 (Ct. App. 1994). Rule 65(c) does not state \r\n  a time limit within which a party suffering injuries due to a temporary injunction \r\n  must move to recover damages on the injunction bond. \"The general rule is that \r\n  no right or cause of action accrues for the wrongful issuance of an injunction \r\n  until there has been a final determination of the action in which the injunction \r\n  was issued.\" 43A C.J.S. Injunctions Â§ 320 (1978). However, if an appeal \r\n  is pending, a suit on the bond is premature. 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions \r\n  Â§ 341 (2000). But see 43A C.J.S. Injunctions Â§ 320 (1978) (stating \r\n  some courts find the right to an action on a bond immediately follows dissolution \r\n  of the bond notwithstanding an appeal from the judgment).\r\n\r\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court to hear \r\n  matters after issuance of the remittitur is well established. For instance, \r\n  once the remittitur is issued from an appellate court, the circuit court acquires \r\n  jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and take any action consistent with the \r\n  appellate court's ruling. See Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, \r\n  313 S.C. 412, 414-15, 438 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1993). In Moore v. North American \r\n  Van Lines, 319 S.C. 446, 462 S.E.2d 275 (1995), the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court held that despite the issuance of the remittitur and the fact that the \r\n  case was not expressly \"remanded\" to the circuit court, the circuit court was \r\n  still vested with jurisdiction to hear the appellant's motion for restitution. \r\n  Moore, 319 S.C. at 448, 462 S.E.2d at 276. Further, circuit courts are \r\n  vested with jurisdiction to hear motions for statutory attorney fees and trial \r\n  costs after the remittitur has been issued. Muller, 313 S.C. at 414-16, \r\n  438 S.E.2d at 250; see also Bunkum v. Manor  Props., 321 \r\n  S.C. 95, 98-99, 467 S.E.2d 758, 760 (Ct. App. 1996) (jurisdiction to entertain \r\n  motion for costs against an appeal bond was properly in the circuit court, not \r\n  with the master, after the remittitur was issued).\r\n\r\n We do not interpret Rule 65(c) to preclude an \r\n  application to the circuit court for damages on a bond after an appeal has ended \r\n  and the remittitur has been issued. A motion for costs under an injunction bond \r\n  is similar to motions for trial costs, attorney fees, and restitution. Accordingly, \r\n  we find the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the motion \r\n  after the remittitur was issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Res Judicata\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Anderson also argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  relying on the doctrine of res judicata to dismiss his claim. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same \r\n    parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that \r\n    was the subject of a prior action between those parties. Under the doctrine \r\n    of res judicata, '[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were \r\n    adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised \r\n    in the former suit.' To establish res judicata, the defendant must prove the \r\n    following three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the \r\n    subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 \r\n  S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999) (citations omitted). \r\n\r\n Clearly, the subject matter in this action, individual \r\n  damages allegedly suffered by Anderson resulting from wrongful injunction, is \r\n  not the same as the subject matter of the former suit to determine whether PCM \r\n  had to pay the proceeds of the sale of the marina to Divine as payment on the \r\n  note. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in dismissing Anderson's claim based \r\n  on the doctrine of res judicata. \r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n We reverse the circuit court's order and remand \r\n  for a full hearing to determine the actual damages, if any, incurred by Anderson \r\n  during the time the temporary injunction was in place. See Chambron, 317 S.C. \r\n  at 45, 451 S.E.2d at 411 (limiting the recovery of costs and damages for wrongful \r\n  injunction to the period of the temporary restraining order or temporary injunction). \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n  HEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   According to the \"Order: Disposition of Motions\" signed by the circuit\r\ncourt judge, the parties agreed that no written order was necessary and the judge\r\norally dictated his ruling in the record. \r\n2. \tExcept in divorce, child custody and non-support\r\nactions where the giving of security is discretionary, no\r\nrestraining order or temporary injunction shall issue\r\nexcept upon the giving of security by the applicant, in\r\nsuch sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of\r\nsuch costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered\r\nby any party who is found to have been wrongfully\r\nenjoined or restrained . . . . A surety upon a bond or\r\nundertaking under this rule submits himself to the\r\njurisdiction of the court . . . .

Appellants allege that Dr. Crumpler's negligent failure to adequately treat \r\n  and/or failure to hospitalize Donna Brown for psychiatric problems resulted \r\n  in the beating death of sixteen-month-old Nathan Brown. We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n In April of 1994, Chris Brown noticed a gradual \r\n  change in the behavior of his wife, Donna. Donna's usual level of activity decreased \r\n  and she became lethargic. The family had just moved into a new house. Rather \r\n  than helping Chris, Donna sat around \"not doing anything.\" Chris testified Donna \r\n  seemed \"depressed.\"\r\n\r\n Chris, a member of the National Guard, was scheduled \r\n  to depart for a two-week annual training session in New Mexico. Due to his concern \r\n  for Donna, he requested permission of his commanding officer to stay home. The \r\n  commanding officer required Chris to obtain a doctor's statement certifying \r\n  that Donna needed Chris at home. When Donna arrived home on Friday, April 29, \r\n  1994, Chris took her to the emergency room at Greenville Memorial Hospital, \r\n  an affiliate of Greenville Hospital System, to obtain the doctor's statement.\r\n\r\n Dr. Crumpler examined Donna in the emergency room \r\n  of Greenville Memorial Hospital and diagnosed her as suffering from acute delusional \r\n  psychosis. Crumpler suggested Donna be hospitalized. Neither Chris nor Donna \r\n  wanted to admit Donna to the hospital. Chris assured Crumpler he would care \r\n  for Donna at home and bring her back if any problems developed before Monday. \r\n  Before releasing Donna, Crumpler contacted an adult female family friend and \r\n  asked her about Donna and the Brown home situation. Based on this conversation, \r\n  Crumpler believed the plans for Donna were satisfactory. Crumpler gave Chris \r\n  a note stating he should be excused from Guard duty and advised Chris to take \r\n  Donna to the Mental Health Center on Monday for follow-up evaluation and treatment. \r\n  Crumpler prescribed Vistaril. \r\n\r\n The next day, Saturday, Chris thought Donna seemed \r\n  better. By Sunday morning, Donna appeared strangely energetic; she raced around \r\n  the house singing a hymn. Chris found this disturbing and attempted to get Donna \r\n  to slow down. He tried to physically restrain Donna's movement. To Chris's surprise, \r\n  Donna suddenly fell asleep in the middle of struggling with him. Chris took \r\n  Donna to the bedroom where she remained for approximately thirty minutes. Meanwhile, \r\n  the Browns' sons, Adam, four, and Nathan, sixteen months, were in the front \r\n  room of the house.\r\n\r\n When Donna awoke, she seemed agitated. Donna resumed \r\n  walking around the house, singing religious songs. When Donna asked Chris for \r\n  the key to a shed on their property, Chris refused, fearing for Donna's safety. \r\n  Donna became angry and repeatedly hit Chris with a rod from the closet. A violent \r\n  struggle ensued during which Donna struck Chris with the rod, told Chris she \r\n  hated him, and threatened to kill him.\r\n\r\n As Donna and Chris struggled, Adam gave Chris \r\n  a pipe bender, which Chris thought he could use to pin Donna's arms behind her. \r\n  In the middle of the struggle, Donna suddenly went limp again and seemed to \r\n  be asleep. Chris released her and went into the kitchen to call 911. While Chris \r\n  was on the phone, Donna beat Nathan to death. \r\n\r\n Prosecutors charged Donna with murder and two \r\n  counts of assault and battery with intent to kill. At Donna's criminal nonjury \r\n  trial, Dr. Larry Montgomery testified Donna is a paranoid schizophrenic who \r\n  was unable to distinguish between moral and legal right and moral and legal \r\n  wrong when she killed Nathan. Montgomery opined Donna was not criminally responsible \r\n  for her actions under the M'Naughten test. (2) \r\n  He agreed that Donna had not exhibited any violent behavior prior to her examination \r\n  by Dr. Crumpler in the emergency room on April 29, 1994. The State stipulated \r\n  Donna was not guilty by reason of insanity. At the conclusion of the trial, \r\n  the court found Donna not guilty by reason of insanity.\r\n\r\n  After the criminal trial, Donna Brown, \r\n  Chris Brown, as Personal Representative of Nathan Brown, and Chris Brown, individually, \r\n  filed actions against Dr. Crumpler, Greenville Hospital System, and Carolina \r\n  Emergency Medicine. They alleged Dr. Crumpler negligently failed to properly \r\n  diagnose, treat, and hospitalize Donna, causing her to kill her son by beating \r\n  him to death on May 1, 1994.  \r\n  (3)\r\n\r\n The majority of these actions were subsequently \r\n  dismissed. The trial court dismissed Chris Brown's actions (both individual \r\n  and as Personal Representative of Nathan Brown) against Dr. Crumpler and the \r\n  Greenville Hospital System finding they were filed after the expiration of the \r\n  statute of limitations. The court denied the motion for summary judgment as \r\n  to Carolina Emergency Medicine finding it was timely served under the statute \r\n  of limitations.\r\n\r\n The trial court denied Respondents' motion for \r\n  summary judgment on Donna's claims finding genuine issues of material fact existed \r\n  as to whether Donna's insanity tolled the statute of limitations during the \r\n  period of her disability.\r\n\r\n The trial court subsequently granted summary judgment \r\n  on Chris Brown's action against Carolina Emergency Medical and on all of Donna's \r\n  actions. As to Appellants' allegations of a failure to hospitalize Donna, the \r\n  court concluded Appellants did not demonstrate a basis for involuntary commitment. \r\n  In addressing Appellants' allegations of inadequate treatment, the court found \r\n  Appellants did not show a violation of any standard of medical care which was \r\n  most probably the proximate cause of any injury. It is from these rulings that \r\n  Donna and Chris Brown appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \"Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear \r\n  that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences \r\n  to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.\" Etheredge v. Richland Sch. Dist. \r\n  One, 341 S.C. 307, 311, 534 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2000). \"In ruling on a motion \r\n  for summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom \r\n  should be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIssues on Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the court err in granting summary judgment \r\n    on the ground no evidence existed supporting an involuntary commitment?\r\n  Did the court err in excluding Dr. Nagelberg's \r\n    affidavit?\r\n  Did the court err in granting summary judgment \r\n    on the ground Appellants failed to meet the \"most probably\" proximate causation \r\n    threshold?\r\n  Should this court affirm the trial court based \r\n    on Respondents' additional sustaining grounds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Involuntary Commitment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellants contend the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment on the ground no evidence existed to support Donna's need for \r\n  involuntary hospitalization. We disagree. \r\n\r\n In his reply affidavit, Crumpler asserted the \r\n  only way he could have admitted Donna, given her refusal to be hospitalized, \r\n  would have been through an involuntary commitment proceeding. An involuntary \r\n  commitment requires:\r\n\r\n\r\n   (1) [a] written affidavit under oath by a person \r\n    stating:\r\n\r\n   (a) a belief that the person is mentally ill and \r\n    because of this condition is likely to cause serious harm to himself or others \r\n    if not immediately hospitalized;\r\n\r\n   (b) the specific type of serious harm thought \r\n    probable if the person is not immediately hospitalized and the factual basis \r\n    for this belief;\r\n\r\n   (2) a certification in triplicate by at least \r\n    one licensed physician stating that the physician has examined the person \r\n    and is of the opinion that the person is mentally ill and because of this \r\n    condition is likely to cause harm to himself through neglect, inability to \r\n    care for himself, or personal injury, or otherwise, or to others if not immediately \r\n    hospitalized. The certification must contain the grounds for the opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-17-410 (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\n Appellants argued that Crumpler's \"diagnosis \r\n  itself  [is] grounds for involuntary commitment.\" The clear language of \r\n  the statute, however, requires more than a diagnosis of mental illness to justify \r\n  the extreme measure of involuntary commitment. This accords with the general \r\n  rule:\r\n\r\n\r\n   A mental illness or disorder is not, alone, sufficient \r\n    to justify a commitment, or deprivation of liberty or privacy. Individuals \r\n    may not be civilly committed involuntarily or deprived of their liberty or \r\n    privacy unless they pose a danger to themselves or to others, or are gravely \r\n    or greatly disabled, and neglect, refuse, or are unable to care for themselves \r\n    or to provide for their basic needs or to protect their lives or health. A \r\n    state may not confine individuals involuntarily if they are dangerous to no \r\n    one and capable of surviving safely in freedom alone or with the help of willing \r\n    and responsible family members or friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n56 C.J.S.  Mental Health  Â§ 49a (1992).\r\n\r\n Viewing the record in the light most favorable \r\n  to Appellants, there is no evidence that the statutory requirements for involuntary \r\n  commitment were present in this case. Chris assured Crumpler he would take care \r\n  of Donna if she was not hospitalized. Crumpler's emergency room notes state \r\n  \"[Donna] has not been violent in any way.\" The social worker's notes concur. \r\n  Dr. Montgomery agreed that Donna had not exhibited any violent behavior prior \r\n  to her examination by Dr. Crumpler on April 29, 1994. Crumpler concluded \"[i]n \r\n  [his] medical judgment, circumstances did not exist to proceed with an involuntary \r\n  commitment against the wishes of the patient and her husband. There was no indication \r\n  that she was a risk of danger to herself or others based on the circumstances \r\n  presented.\"\r\n\r\n Because Appellants failed to establish any statutory \r\n  basis for involuntary commitment, the trial court properly found there was no \r\n  genuine issue of material fact that Crumpler could not have involuntarily committed \r\n  Donna. See Rule 56(e), SCRCP (\"When a motion for summary judgment is \r\n  made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon \r\n  the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits \r\n  or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing \r\n  that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary \r\n  judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Dr. Nagelberg's Affidavit \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellants contend the court erred in excluding \r\n  the affidavit of Dr. Daniel Nagelberg. We agree.\r\n\r\n \"The qualification of an expert witness and the \r\n  admissibility of the expert's testimony are matters within the trial court's \r\n  discretion.\" Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, \r\n  487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997). A witness is not required to work or have worked \r\n  in the same field or area of practice to be competent to testify as an expert \r\n  in that area. Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 501, 534 S.E.2d 295, 303 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000). Competency to testify as an expert requires a witness to \"have \r\n  acquired by reason of study or experience or both such knowledge and skill in \r\n  a profession or science that he is better qualified than the jury to form an \r\n  opinion on the particular subject of his testimony.\" Gooding, 326 S.C. \r\n  at 252-53, 487 S.E.2d at 598. Any defect in the education or experience of an \r\n  expert affects the weight and not the admissibility of the expert's testimony. \r\n  Id. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598.\r\n\r\nGooding involved a medical malpractice action \r\n  against a hospital and an anesthesiologist. In that case, the supreme court \r\n  determined that an emergency medical technician/paramedic was qualified to testify \r\n  as an expert witness in the limited area of intubation, although he was not \r\n  an anesthesiologist. Id. at 252-54, 487 S.E.2d at 597, 598; see also \r\n  Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 286, 457 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1995) (finding a doctor's \r\n  limited exposure to a particular field merely goes to the weight of his testimony \r\n  and not its admissibility).\r\n\r\n Nagelberg is a licensed psychologist practicing \r\n  in Savannah, Georgia. He received a doctoral degree in clinical psychology from \r\n  Bowling Green State University in 1980 and has been licensed in Georgia since \r\n  1981. The court found Nagelberg's affidavit did not demonstrate he was competent \r\n  \"to testify with regard to the standard of care of an emergency room physician \r\n  or what the requisite knowledge would or should be for an expert practicing \r\n  in the field of emergency medicine.\" Thus, the court excluded Nagelberg's affidavit.\r\n\r\n Nagelberg's testimony concerned the limited area \r\n  of the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses. (4) \r\n  In Howle v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 288 S.C. 586, 344 S.E.2d 157 (Ct. App. \r\n  1986), this court stated \"a psychologist, once qualified as an expert witness \r\n  by reason of education, training, and experience, is competent to testify as \r\n  to diagnosis, prognosis, and causation of mental and emotional disturbance.\" \r\n  Id. at 594, 344 S.E.2d at 161. \"At most, a psychologist's lack of a medical \r\n  license affects his credibility . . . .\" Id.\r\n\r\n Based on the above, we find the court abused its \r\n  discretion in declining to qualify Nagelberg as an expert in the diagnosis and \r\n  treatment of mental illness and in excluding his affidavit from consideration \r\n  in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court found that \r\n  even with consideration of Nagelberg's affidavit, Respondents were entitled \r\n  to summary judgment. We review the court's order granting summary judgment with \r\n  consideration of Nagelberg's affidavit. \r\n\r\n\r\n    III. Proximate Causation  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n Appellants argue the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment on their action for inadequate treatment based on a failure \r\n  to present expert testimony of proximate causation. We agree. \r\n\r\n\r\n   In a medical malpractice action, it is incumbent \r\n    on the plaintiff to establish proximate cause as well as the negligence of \r\n    the physician. Negligence is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause \r\n    of the injury complained of, and negligence may be deemed a proximate cause \r\n    only when without such negligence the injury would not have occurred or could \r\n    have been avoided. When one relies solely upon the opinion of medical experts \r\n    to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence and the injury, \r\n    the experts must, with reasonable certainty, state that in their professional \r\n    opinion, the injuries complained of most probably resulted from the defendant's \r\n    negligence. The reason for this rule is the highly technical nature of malpractice \r\n    litigation. Since many malpractice suits involve ailments and treatments outside \r\n    the realm of ordinary lay knowledge, expert testimony is generally necessary. \r\n    When it is the only evidence of proximate cause relied upon, it must provide \r\n    a significant causal link between the alleged negligence and the plaintiff's \r\n    injuries, rather than a tenuous and hypothetical connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nEllis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 125, 473 \r\n  S.E.2d 793, 795 (1996) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n Appellants presented affidavits from Nagelberg \r\n  and Dr. John Cusack. Cusack worked as an emergency physician prior to becoming \r\n  a psychiatrist. Nagelberg averred in his affidavit that \"[t]he proper treatment \r\n  of choice for acute delusional psychosis is through hospitalization and medicine \r\n  and not through counseling.\" Nagelberg further stated \"[i]t is my firm professional \r\n  opinion and belief that, given Ms. Brown's diagnosis of acute delusional psychosis, \r\n  it would not be reasonable to first of all allow her to leave the hospital and \r\n  second of all to treat such a dangerous condition with a mere referral for mental \r\n  health counseling a few days later.\" Nagelberg continued: \"[Donna's condition] \r\n  warranted either a psychological evaluation to be performed by a licensed psychologist \r\n  or a psychiatric consultation to be performed by a licensed psychiatrist.\" Nagelberg \r\n  further stated \"[i]n my opinion, the departure by Dr. Crumpler from the standard \r\n  of care was the proximate cause of the tragedy in this case.\"\r\n\r\n Cusack's affidavit opined \"[t]he standard of care \r\n  for an emergency room physician dictates that optimally the patient should have \r\n  been immediately hospitalized. Dr. Crumpler neither hospitalized the patient, \r\n  nor called a psychiatrist for consult. To compound these errors, Dr. Crumpler \r\n  prescribed Vistaril, an antihistamine medication, which was inappropriate considering \r\n  his diagnosis that Ms. Brown was psychotic. Vistaril is a medication which would \r\n  offer only minimal palliation without addressing the psychotic core of this \r\n  patient's illness.\" The affidavit further stated Donna \"should have been hospitalized \r\n  or prescribed an antipsychotic medication while emergently treated and prescribed \r\n  daily antipsychotic medication until her follow-up appointment . . . .\" \r\n  (5) Cusack continued: \"The gravity of Ms. Brown's psychiatric illness \r\n  was beyond referral for simple counseling at Mental Health. The standard of \r\n  care for an emergency physician would appear to me to have been breached in \r\n  this case as set forth above. Further, if the patient had been hospitalized \r\n  and prescribed proper medication, the probability of a fatal outcome would have \r\n  been significantly diminished.\" (6)\r\n\r\n Viewing this evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can be reasonably drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  parties, we find that Cusack and Nagelberg's affidavits are sufficient to meet \r\n  the standard required to survive summary judgment. See Baughman v. Am. Tel. \r\n  &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 111, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (stating that \r\n  the determination of whether expert medical testimony is sufficient to establish \r\n  causation does not require that the expert actually use the words \"most probably\").\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV. ADDITIONAL SUSTAINING GROUNDS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n Carolina Emergency Medicine argues this court \r\n  should affirm the trial court's order on the ground that service of process \r\n  on Carolina Emergency Medicine was ineffective. (7) \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\n Questions of fact arising on a motion to quash \r\n  service of process for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant are to be determined \r\n  by the court. Lawson v. Jeter, 243 S.C. 103, 106, 132 S.E.2d 276, 277 \r\n  (1963). The findings of the circuit court on such issues are binding on the \r\n  appellate court unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or manifestly influenced \r\n  or controlled by error of law. Id.\r\n\r\n Carolina Emergency Medicine is a group of emergency \r\n  room doctors, including Crumpler, that provide emergency physician services \r\n  to Greenville Memorial Hospital. Carolina Emergency Medicine does not maintain \r\n  an office and its only public physical presence is in the hospital emergency \r\n  room. Appellants' process server, Selena Riddle, went to the hospital to serve \r\n  Carolina Emergency Medicine. In her affidavit, Riddle stated she was directed \r\n  to Katie Gillespie who allegedly indicated she was the manager of Carolina Emergency \r\n  Medicine. Based on Gillespie's claim, Riddle served Gillespie as an agent for \r\n  Carolina Emergency Medicine. \r\n\r\n Dr. Jeffrey Leshman, the president of Carolina \r\n  Emergency Medicine, and Gillespie, provided affidavits establishing that Gillespie \r\n  was an employee of the hospital and was not authorized to accept service on \r\n  behalf of Carolina Emergency Medicine.\r\n\r\n Carolina Emergency Medicine argues Appellants' \r\n  service of process on Gillespie, an emergency room secretary employed by the \r\n  hospital, was ineffective. \r\n\r\n Service may be made upon a corporation \"by delivering \r\n  a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, \r\n  or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service \r\n  of process and if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service \r\n  and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant.\" Rule \r\n  4(d)(3), SCACR. See Roche v. Young Bros. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 210, \r\n  456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995) (\"Service on a corporation may be made by hand delivering \r\n  a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation or to an \r\n  authorized agent of the corporation.\"). In order to be effective, service must \r\n  be made on an actual agent. Hammond v. Honda Motor Co., 128 F.R.D. 638, \r\n  643 (D.S.C. 1989).\r\n\r\n In determining whether an alleged agent has authority \r\n  to receive process for a defendant, this court concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n   [t]he courts must look to the circumstances surrounding \r\n    the relationship and find authority which is either express or implied from \r\n    the type of relationship between the defendant and the alleged agent. Claims \r\n    by one to possess authority to receive process or actual acceptance of process \r\n    by an alleged agent will not necessarily bind the defendant. Rather, there \r\n    must be evidence the defendant intended to confer such authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 \r\n  S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. App. 1996) (construing service upon an agent under Rule 4(d)(1), \r\n  SCRCP). \"Without specific authorization to receive process, service is not effective \r\n  when made upon an employee of the defendant, such as a secretary.\" Id.  \r\n  at 523-24, 473 S.E.2d at 67.\r\n\r\n Even under our limited standard of review, we \r\n  find Appellants failed to show sufficient compliance with Rule 4(d), SCRCP, \r\n  to effect service on Carolina Emergency Medicine. See Jensen v. Doe, \r\n  292 S.C. 592, 594, 358 S.E.2d 148, 148-49 (Ct. App. 1987) (plaintiff has the \r\n  burden of showing the court has personal jurisdiction over defendant). Accordingly, \r\n  we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to Carolina Emergency \r\n  Medicine. (8)\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n In conclusion, we reverse the circuit court's \r\n  exclusion of Dr. Nagelberg's affidavit. We affirm the court's grant of summary \r\n  judgment dismissing Chris and Donna's actions against Carolina Emergency Medicine \r\n  for ineffective service of process. We affirm the court's grant of summary judgment \r\n  on the remaining actions based on negligent failure to hospitalize Donna. We \r\n  reverse and remand the court's grant of summary judgment on the remaining actions \r\n  as to the suits based on negligent failure to adequately treat Donna.\r\n\r\n For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the \r\n  trial court is hereby\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND \r\n  REMANDED.\r\n\r\n  HEARN, C.J., and SHULER, J., concur. \r\n   \r\n\r\n1.    \r\n  Brown is a fictitious name used to protect the identity of the appellants. \r\n   \r\n2.  In South Carolina, the M'Naughten \r\n  test is the standard for determining whether a defendant's mental condition \r\n  at the time of the offense rendered him criminally responsible. Davenport \r\n  v. State, 301 S.C. 39, 40, 389 S.E.2d 649, 649 (1990). The defendant is \r\n  considered legally insane if, at the time of the offense, he lacked the capacity \r\n  to distinguish moral or legal right from moral or legal wrong. Id.  \r\n3.  Chris Brown also filed an \r\n  action as Guardian for Adam Brown. The trial court dismissed this action finding \r\n  Adam was not a beneficiary under the Wrongful Death Act and there is not a cause \r\n  of action for loss of parental consortium.  \r\n4.    \r\n  One sentence of Nagelberg's affidavit refers to the standard of care for an \r\n  emergency physician. \"In conclusion, the dreadful tragedy that took place at \r\n  [the Brown] home within hours from her release should have been reasonably foreseen \r\n  by an expert with the requisite knowledge to practice in the field of emergency \r\n  medicine.\"  \r\n5.  The affidavit originally \r\n  stated Donna should have been \"hospitalized and prescribed an antipsychotic \r\n  medication.\" The \"and\" was crossed through, replaced with \"or,\" and initialed \r\n  by Dr. Cusack.  \r\n6.  The \"and\" in this sentence, \r\n  toward the end of Cusack's affidavit, was not altered.  \r\n7.  A respondent may raise on \r\n  appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the trial court's \r\n  ruling. See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 716, 722-23 (2000) (appellate court may review respondent's additional \r\n  reasons and rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm \r\n  the lower court's judgment; it is within appellate court's discretion whether \r\n  to address any additional sustaining grounds).  \r\n8.  We decline to address Greenville \r\n  Hospital System's remaining additional sustaining ground. See I'On, 338 \r\n  S.C. at 420 n. 9, 526 S.E.2d at 723 n. 9 (holding appellate court may decline \r\n  to address respondent's additional sustaining grounds when it reverses trial \r\n  court's decision).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3421","title":"Trivelas v.

The trial court granted partial summary judgment \r\n  in favor of the plaintiffs. DOT appeals, asserting the trial court erred in \r\n  finding DOT was negligent per se. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n On the afternoon of November 19, 1997, DOT was \r\n  contacted to assist in clearing lumber that had fallen from a truck traveling \r\n  on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 20 near mile marker three in Aiken County. \r\n  David Monborne, a maintenance equipment operator and truck driver for DOT, was \r\n  transporting a back-hoe to the scene of the lumber spill. Monborne was traveling \r\n  on the westbound lane of Interstate 20 and driving a DOT dump truck pulling \r\n  a trailer containing the back-hoe. The truck did not have a flasher or any special \r\n  lights. A van driven by Trivelas struck the right corner of the DOT trailer \r\n  as Monborne was turning into the median to approach the lumber spill on the \r\n  east side of the interstate.\r\n\r\n In his deposition, Monborne stated he moved into \r\n  the left lane of traffic as he approached the lumber spill. Monborne then turned \r\n  on his left-hand signal to indicate he was going to turn into the median. Monborne \r\n  stated he \"started slowing down real gradually\" and slowed to less than ten \r\n  miles per hour before turning into the median. \r\n\r\n Trooper William Lynn was assisting with the lumber \r\n  spill that afternoon and observed the traffic accident involving Trivelas and \r\n  the DOT truck. Lynn stated the DOT truck's left turn signal was blinking as \r\n  it turned into the median and that the truck was almost completely off the roadway \r\n  when the van driven by Trivelas struck the right corner of the trailer. The \r\n  trooper further stated that following the accident, he checked the DOT truck \r\n  and all of the lights and blinkers on both the truck and trailer were working \r\n  properly.\r\n\r\n Trooper Lynn spoke with Trivelas immediately after \r\n  the accident. During his deposition, Trooper Lynn described his conversation \r\n  with Trivelas:\r\n\r\n He told me that he was traveling west bound, that \r\n  as he approached the area he noticed the truck and all of the patrol cars on \r\n  the east bound side of the road way, and that his attention was directed over \r\n  there for a short time, and when he looked back the truck in front of him, which \r\n  was the DOT truck, had slowed down sharply and he wasn't able to avoid an impact. \r\n  They say [Trivelas] tried to brake and still hit it. I didn't really question \r\n  him in depth, but that is basically what he told me.\r\n\r\n The trooper additionally testified:\r\n\r\nI feel like his attention was distracted to the \r\n  other side of the roadway. He was watching the wrong thing -- you know, we call \r\n  it rubber necking[,] which we see everyday. \r\n\r\n I feel like he was -- his attention was transfixed \r\n  on what was going on in the east bound lane and it -- by the time he realized \r\n  something was going on in front of him, it was too late for him to do anything \r\n  other than just lock his brakes up and run into the back of the trailer.\r\n\r\n From my standpoint as a trooper, his attention \r\n  should have been in front of him to the traffic that was going on in front of \r\n  him. \r\n\r\n Additionally, DOT deposed Kendrick Richardson, \r\n  an engineer who conducts accident reconstruction analysis. Richardson opined \r\n  the \"accident occurred as a direct result of Mr. Trivelas not behaving in an \r\n  attentive manner when driving.\" \r\n\r\n The plaintiffs commenced this negligence action \r\n  against DOT and E.H. Sistrunk Trucking, Inc., the owner of the truck transporting \r\n  the lumber. The case was scheduled for trial on August 28, 2000. On August 22, \r\n  2000, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment against DOT, \r\n  asserting DOT was negligent as a matter of law. The motion for partial summary \r\n  judgment was heard in chambers on August 24, 2000. On August 28, 2000, the trial \r\n  court issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, \r\n  finding that DOT's actions constituted negligence as a matter of law, or \"negligence \r\n  per se.\" The order also indicated that the trial court had considered the deposition \r\n  transcripts of various witnesses and the deposition testimonies as presented \r\n  in the arguments of counsel. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n Summary judgment is appropriate only when \"the \r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Green v. Cottrell, 346 S.C. 53, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 324 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. pending; Bruce v. Durney, 341 S.C. \r\n  563, 534 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Tupper v. Dorchester County, \r\n  326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997) (\"Summary judgment is proper where \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.\").\r\n\r\n Under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary \r\n  judgment has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact. Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999). In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the \r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. Summer v. Carpenter, \r\n  328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997); Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further \r\n  inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of \r\n  the law. Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 \r\n  (2000); Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 334 S.C. 150, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d 699 (Ct. App. 1999), aff'd, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000). \"Because \r\n  it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked so no \r\n  person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.\" \r\n  Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment, 337 S.C. at 485, 523 S.E.2d at \r\n  799.\r\n\r\n An appellate court reviews the granting of summary \r\n  judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule \r\n  56, SCRCP. Bray v. Marathon Corp., 347 S.C. 189, 553 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001), cert. pending; Brockbank, 341 S.C. at 800, 534 S.E.2d at \r\n  692; Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998); see also Estate of Cantrell, 302 S.C. 557, 559, 397 S.E.2d 777, \r\n  778 (Ct. App. 1990) (\"On appeal from summary judgment, the reviewing court must \r\n  consider the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party. The judgment may be affirmed only if there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\") (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Section 56-5-800\r\n\r\n DOT contends S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-800 shields \r\n  it from liability for negligence as a matter of law for the incident arising \r\n  out of the plaintiffs' cause of action. This statute provides that certain provisions \r\n  of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways \"shall not apply to persons, \r\n  motor vehicles and other equipment while actually engaged in work upon the highway \r\n  but shall apply to such persons and vehicles when traveling to or from such \r\n  work.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-800 (1991); see also Howard v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Highways, 343 S.C. 149, 154, 538 S.E.2d 291, 293 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n  (stating Â§ 56-5-800 \"denies per se negligence to potential claimants[,] which \r\n  forces them to prove negligence in the specific context of roadway repair operations\").\r\n\r\n We note there is no indication in the record DOT \r\n  raised this argument to the Circuit Court. Furthermore, the trial judge did \r\n  not address the issue in his summary judgment order. Additionally, DOT failed \r\n  to raise this matter in any post-trial motion. Therefore, this issue is not \r\n  preserved for appeal. See I'on v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (stating parties should raise all necessary issues and \r\n  arguments to trial court and attempt to obtain a ruling); Townsend v. City \r\n  of Dillon, 326 S.C. 244, 486 S.E.2d 95 (1997) (holding issues not ruled \r\n  upon by the trial judge are not preserved for appellate review); Noisette \r\n  v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991) (ruling issue was not preserved \r\n  for appellate review where the trial court did not explicitly rule on the appellant's \r\n  argument and the appellant made no Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment); \r\n  see also Jean Hoefer Toal, et al., Appellate Practice in South \r\n  Carolina 65 (1999) (reciting the well settled rule that an appellate court \r\n  will only rule upon issues that were properly preserved at the trial level).\r\n\r\nII. Negligence Per Se \r\n  \r\n\r\n The Circuit Court ruled the driver of the DOT \r\n  vehicle violated Â§Â§ 56-5-1560 and 56-5-1920, thus constituting negligence as \r\n  a matter of law. DOT argues this ruling was in error. We agree.\r\n\r\nA. Existence of Statutory \r\n  Duty: Sections 56-5-1560 and 56-5-1920  \r\n\r\n Section 56-5-1560(a) states: \"No person shall \r\n  drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to impede the normal and reasonable \r\n  movement of traffic except when reduced speed is necessary for safe \r\n  operation or in compliance with law.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n Section 56-5-1920 provides:\r\n\r\n Whenever any highway has been divided into two \r\n  or more roadways by leaving an intervening space or by a physical barrier or \r\n  clearly indicated dividing section so constructed as to impede vehicular traffic, \r\n  every vehicle shall be driven only upon the right-hand roadway unless \r\n  directed or permitted to use another roadway by official traffic-control devices \r\n  or police officers. No vehicle shall be driven over, across or \r\n  within any such dividing space, barrier or section except through \r\n  an opening in such physical barrier or dividing section or space or at a crossover \r\n  or intersection as established, unless specifically prohibited \r\n  by public authority. For clarification, a left turn across a painted median \r\n  is authorized unless prohibited by an official traffic-control device.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n DOT contends there was sufficient evidence to \r\n  create material issues of fact as to whether: (1) the DOT truck was driving \r\n  across an opening in the median in compliance with Â§ 56-5-1920; and (2) it was \r\n  necessary for the DOT vehicle to drive below the minimum speed limit. DOT also \r\n  asserts that because its truck was responding to a lumber spill, which was creating \r\n  a traffic hazard, there was a material issue of fact regarding whether DOT was \r\n  permitted to cross the median by a police officer.\r\n\r\n DOT presented evidence that its truck crossed \r\n  an open area of grass in the median to respond to the Highway Patrol's request \r\n  for assistance in clearing away the debris of the lumber spill. Monborne testified \r\n  he slowed to approximately ten miles per hour to safely turn into the median. \r\n  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to DOT, we find the trial court \r\n  erred in concluding there was undisputed evidence that the driver of the DOT \r\n  truck violated Â§Â§ 56-5-1560 and 56-5-1920. Furthermore, our case law has recognized \r\n  that a violation of a traffic statute does not constitute negligence per se \r\n  under explanatory or excusatory circumstances. Davis v. Boyd, 262 S.C. \r\n  679, 207 S.E.2d 101 (1974); Myers v. Evans, 225 S.C. 80, 81 S.E.2d 32 \r\n  (1954).\r\n\r\nB. Proximate Cause\r\n\r\nTo prevail in an action for negligence, the plaintiff \r\n  must prove the following three elements:\r\n\r\n\r\n  a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; \r\n    \r\n\r\n  defendant's breach of that duty by a negligent \r\n    act or omission; and\r\n  damages to plaintiff proximately resulting from \r\n    the breach of duty. \r\n\r\n\r\nBloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  710 (2000); Jeffords v. Lesesne, 343 S.C. 656, 541 S.E.2d 847 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000); Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\n Plaintiffs assert DOT is liable for damages on \r\n  the theory of negligence per se due to DOT's alleged violations of Â§Â§ 56-5-1560 \r\n  and 56-5-1920. Negligence per se is negligence arising from the defendant's \r\n  violation of a statute. See Coleman v. Shaw, 281 S.C. 107, 314 S.E.2d \r\n  154 (Ct. App. 1984); see also 28 Words &amp; Phases Negligence Per \r\n  Se 683 (1955) (citing Boylston v. Armour &amp; Co., 196 S.C. 1, 12 \r\n  S.E.2d 34 (1940)).\r\n\r\n In Rayfield v. South Carolina Department of \r\n  Corrections, 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1988), we enunciated \r\n  the test for determining when a duty created by statute will support an action \r\n  for negligence:\r\n\r\n In order to show that the defendant owes him a \r\n  duty of care arising from a statute, the plaintiff must show two things: (1) \r\n  that the essential purpose of the statute is to protect from the kind of harm \r\n  the plaintiff has suffered; and (2) that he is a member of the class of persons \r\n  the statute is intended to protect.\r\n\r\n If the plaintiff makes this showing, he has proven \r\n  the first element of a claim for negligence: viz., that the defendant owes him \r\n  a duty of care. If he then shows that the defendant violated the statute, he \r\n  has proven the second element of a negligence cause of action: viz., that the \r\n  defendant, by act or omission, failed to exercise due care. This constitutes \r\n  proof of negligence per se.\r\n\r\nId. at 103, 374 S.E.2d at 914-15.\r\n\r\n A statute can establish a duty to plaintiff. Whitlaw \r\n  v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991). A breach of the duty \r\n  can be found with a showing of violation of the statute. Id.  The finding \r\n  of a statutory violation, however, does not automatically lead to the recovery \r\n  of damages. Seals v. Winburn, 314 S.C. 416, 445 S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n  The plaintiff must prove the violation proximately caused the injury complained \r\n  of by the injured party. Id.; see also  Rayfield, 297 S.C. at 104, 374 \r\n  S.E.2d at 915 (\"Negligence per se simply means the jury need not decide if the \r\n  defendant acted as would a reasonable man in the circumstances. The statute \r\n  fixes the standard of conduct required of the defendant, leaving the jury merely \r\n  to decide whether the defendant breached the statute. If he did, his failure \r\n  to take due care is established as a matter of law. The only issue then left \r\n  for the jury to determine is the third element of negligence, viz., whether \r\n  the defendant's conduct proximately caused damage to the plaintiff.\"); 1 John \r\n  E. Parker &amp; Jack L. Nettles, Automobile and Truck Accidents 206, \r\n  in South Carolina Practice Manual  (Howard-M&ouml;ise ed. 2000) (\"While \r\n  the violation of a statute is negligence per se, such violation is not actionable \r\n  unless the specific violation is a proximate cause of the injury â€¦.\") (footnote \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\n In Oliver v. South Carolina Department of Highways \r\n  and Public Transportation, 309 S.C. 313, 422 S.E.2d 128 (1992), our Supreme \r\n  Court recited the well established rules concerning proximate cause:\r\n\r\n Proximate cause requires proof of both causation \r\n  in fact, and legal cause. \"Causation in fact is proved by establishing the injury \r\n  would not have occurred 'but for' the defendant's negligence.\" Whitlaw v. \r\n  Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1991) (quoting Bramlette \r\n  v. Charter- Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 74, 393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1990)).\r\n\r\n . . . . \r\n\r\n \"Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.\" \r\n  Id. \"The standard by which foreseeability is determined is that of looking to \r\n  the 'natural and probable consequences' of the complained of act.\" Young \r\n  v. Tide Craft,  Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 462, 242 S.E.2d 671, 675 (1978).\r\n\r\n . . . .  \r\n Furthermore, legal cause is ordinarily a question \r\n  of fact for the jury. Only when the evidence is susceptible to only one inference \r\n  does it become a matter of law for the court. Matthews v. Porter, 239 \r\n  S.C. 620, 124 S.E.2d 321 (1962).\r\n\r\nId. at 316-17, 481 S.E.2d at 130-31.\r\n\r\n This Court recently revisited the issue of proximate \r\n  cause in Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 548 S.E.2d 605 \r\n  (Ct. App 2001):\r\n\r\nThis case hinges on whether Characters breached \r\n  a duty owed to Parks and whether this breach was the proximate cause of Parks' \r\n  injuries. It is apodictic that a plaintiff may only recover for injuries proximately \r\n  caused by the defendant's negligence. Olson v. Faculty House, 344 S.C. \r\n  194, 544 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 2001)  [cert. granted].\r\n\r\n To prove causation, a plaintiff must demonstrate \r\n  both causation in fact and legal cause. Id. Causation in fact is proved by establishing \r\n  the plaintiff's injury would not have occurred \"but for\" the defendant's negligence. \r\n  Id. Legal cause turns on the issue of foreseeability. Id. An injury is \r\n  foreseeable if it is the natural and probable consequence of a breach of duty. \r\n  Id.  Foreseeability is not determined from hindsight, but rather from \r\n  the defendant's perspective at the time of the alleged breach. Id.  It \r\n  is not necessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate the defendant should have foreseen \r\n  the particular event which occurred but merely that the defendant should have \r\n  foreseen his or her negligence would probably cause injury to someone. Greenville \r\n  Mem'l Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 391 S.E.2d 546 (1990).\r\n\r\nId. at 491, 548 S.E.2d at 609; see also \r\n  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 349, 499 S.E.2d 488, 497 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\n  (\"In a negligence action, the plaintiff must prove proximate cause. Negligence \r\n  is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the injury. Proof of proximate \r\n  cause requires proof of both causation in fact and legal cause. Causation in \r\n  fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred 'but for' \r\n  the defendant's negligence. Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability. \r\n  A plaintiff therefore proves legal cause by establishing the injury in question \r\n  occurred as a natural and probable consequence of the defendant's negligence.\") \r\n  (citations omitted); F.

Comparative Negligence\r\n\r\n The Circuit Court held there was no evidence of \r\n  comparative negligence by Trivelas. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Nelson v. Concrete Supply Company, 303 \r\n  S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991), our Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of comparative \r\n  negligence. Under the doctrine of comparative negligence, negligence by the \r\n  plaintiff does not automatically bar recovery by the plaintiff, provided his \r\n  negligence is not greater than that of the defendant. Ott v. Pittman, \r\n  320 S.C. 72, 463 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995). The Court of Appeals discussed \r\n  the doctrine's effect on our\r\n\r\ntrial courts in Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. \r\n  547, 481 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1997):\r\n\r\n The doctrine of comparative negligence replaces \r\n  the harsh rule of contributory negligence. In the application of the doctrine \r\n  of comparative negligence by a trial jury to a factual scenario, the litigants \r\n  receive a careful, exhaustive factual review of their own conduct. In adopting \r\n  the court-made rule of comparative negligence in Nelson, our Supreme \r\n  Court in essence followed what is known as the \"New Hampshire rule.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 559, 481 S.E.2d at 450-51 (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\n The Brown Court explained the jury's role \r\n  in a comparative negligence\r\n\r\ncase:\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the negligence of a party \r\n  is a question of fact for the jury.\r\n\r\n . . . . \r\n\r\n As a general rule, under a \"less than or equal \r\n  to\" comparative negligence rule, determination of respective degrees of negligence \r\n  attributable to the plaintiff and the defendant presents a question of fact \r\n  for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn. Accordingly, \r\n  apportionment of negligence, which determines both whether a plaintiff is barred \r\n  from recovery or can recover some of his damages and the proportion of damages \r\n  to which he is entitled, is usually a function of the jury.\r\n\r\nId. at 558-59, 481 S.E.2d at 450-51 (emphasis added) \r\n  (citations omitted); see also Lydia v. Horton, 343 S.C. 376, 395, 540 S.E.2d \r\n  102, 112-13 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. granted (\"Comparison of a plaintiff's negligence \r\n  with that of the defendant is a question of fact for the jury to decide.\") (quoting \r\n  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Resources Dep't, 328 S.C. \r\n  24, 32, 491 S.E.2d 571, 575 (1997)).\r\n\r\n In the present action, DOT provided deposition \r\n  testimony from an accident reconstruction expert, as well as the state trooper \r\n  who witnessed the accident. Each opined that Trivelas' inattentiveness and failure \r\n  to properly reduce his speed was the proximate cause of the collision between \r\n  the DOT truck and Trivelas' van. Additionally, Trooper Lynn stated in deposition \r\n  that following the accident, Trivelas told him he was distracted and was not \r\n  observing the traffic directly in front of him when the accident occurred. Viewing \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to DOT, we find there are genuine issues \r\n  as to material facts in regard to \"proximate cause\" \r\n  and \"comparative negligence\" precluding the grant of \r\n  summary judgment. Concomitantly, we rule the trial court erred in granting partial \r\n  summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nIV. Notice/Summary Judgment\r\n\r\n Additionally, DOT argues the trial court erred \r\n  in hearing the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment less than ten \r\n  days after the motion was served. In view of our resolution of DOT's other grounds \r\n  for appeal, we need not address this remaining issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n The grant of summary judgment in favor of the \r\n  plaintiffs is\r\n\r\n  REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for \r\n  trial.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n  HOWARD, J., concurs in result only in \r\n  a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., (concurring in result \r\n  only):  Although I agree with the factual \r\n  analysis, I would dispose of this appeal on a different basis. In my opinion, \r\n  the procedural irregularities require reversal and would allow for a reconsideration \r\n  of the original summary judgment motion filed by Trivelas, which was limited \r\n  to whether or not the South Carolina Department of Transportation was negligent \r\n  as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n The motion was filed less than ten days before \r\n  trial and was heard by the circuit judge in chambers on the eve of trial as \r\n  a part of the pre-trial conference. Rule 56 (c), SCRCP, requires a ten day notice \r\n  to the opposing party, which allows time to prepare and file a proper response \r\n  to the motion. Because the motion was heard in chambers without a court reporter, \r\n  the nature of any procedural objection raised to the trial court is not available \r\n  to us. SCDOT argues that it objected to hearing the motion, but Trivelas disputes \r\n  this. The final written order does not address the timing of the motion, and \r\n  no subsequent motion was made pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, asking the court to \r\n  rule on any objection. Consequently, the record does not reflect that the trial \r\n  judge ruled on the issue, and it is not preserved for our review. See Summersell \r\n  v. S.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 337 S.C. 19, 522 S.E.2d 144 (1999).\r\n\r\nThe order granting summary judgment recites that \r\n  the trial judge considered not only deposition excerpts filed with the brief \r\n  supporting the motion, but also \"deposition testimonies as presented in the \r\n  arguments of counsel.\" As the attorneys stated in oral argument, they were apparently \r\n  allowed to summarize the factual information contained within depositions which \r\n  had not been filed with the court at the time the motion was considered. Not \r\n  surprisingly, the parties now disagree as to what was and was not presented \r\n  to the judge in the unrecorded hearing. \r\n\r\n Following the hearing, SCDOT filed excerpts from \r\n  the deposition of Trooper Lynn which contained statements by Mr. Trivelas implying \r\n  he was inattentive prior to the impact. This is the testimony which the majority \r\n  cites in its factual analysis. This testimony is contained in lines 14 though \r\n  23 of page 17 in Lynn's deposition. Unfortunately, the order of summary judgment \r\n  does not refer to these lines, although it does cite other lines contained on \r\n  the same page of the deposition. \r\n\r\n Trivelas contends he submitted the specific lines \r\n  mentioned in the final order prior to the hearing, but not the entire page. \r\n  SCDOT does not dispute this, but argues that the critical testimony was summarized \r\n  during the arguments, and the entire page was then mailed to the clerk of court \r\n  for inclusion in the record. Page 17 of Trooper Lynn's deposition appears in \r\n  our record on appeal, but Trivelas objects to its inclusion and has moved to \r\n  strike it.\r\n\r\n Trivelas asks us not to consider Trooper Lynn's \r\n  testimony as to Trivelas's inattention prior to the collision because it was \r\n  not filed at or prior to the hearing. However, this argument works both ways, \r\n  and if applied, undermines the trial court's decision because the trial judge \r\n  based his ruling in part upon Trivelas' deposition testimony, which also was \r\n  not filed with the court. According to the order, Trivelas testified in his \r\n  deposition that another vehicle was in front of him and swerved into the adjoining \r\n  lane at the last moment, leaving Trivelas with no time to react to the SCDOT \r\n  truck and trailer. However, no part of Trivelas' deposition is contained in \r\n  the record or was filed with the court at the time of the hearing. \r\n\r\n There is no valid basis upon which we can rule, \r\n  other than to believe one attorney's memory over that of another. The result \r\n  of the procedural irregularities recited above underscores the importance of \r\n  clearly marking, filing and establishing an accurate record of the information \r\n  provided to the trial court for consideration in a motion for summary judgment. \r\n  Arguments of counsel are not evidence, and absent stipulation, they do not provide \r\n  a factual basis for summary judgment. See Rule 56 (c), SCRCP (\"The judgment \r\n  sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"). Furthermore, we cannot \r\n  base a factual review upon them. Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 581 \r\n  n.2, 482 S.E.2d 589, 593 n.2 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"[W]here there is no stipulation, \r\n  a representation of fact by counsel in written briefs, memoranda or made during \r\n  oral argument, may not be considered by the court where it is unsupported by \r\n  the record.\"). I would rule that it is an error of law to base a decision on \r\n  \"deposition testimonies as presented in the arguments of counsel,\" as was done \r\n  in this case, unless copies of the deposition testimony are properly filed in \r\n  the record or the parties have stipulated to the facts. See Id.; Rule \r\n  56 (c), SCRCP. (1) \r\n\r\n For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse and \r\n  remand for further proceedings, but would allow reconsideration of the motion \r\n  made by Trivelas, following proper notice and opportunity to file affidavits \r\n  and deposition testimony as allowed by the rule.  \r\n\r\n 1.   Although \r\n  Rule 56 (f) provides that the court \"may order a continuance to permit affidavits \r\n  to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make \r\n  such order as is just,\" the court ruled at the hearing, and did not defer the \r\n  decision pending the filing of depositions or other supplemental information. \r\n  The written order was not prepared and filed until after the deposition excerpts \r\n  were filed with the clerk, but the trial judge did not continue the hearing \r\n  until they were received. Indeed, there is no indication he was ever aware they \r\n  were filed or had an opportunity to consider them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3422","title":"Allendale County Bank v.

The special referee\r\ncancelled the mortgage satisfaction and concluded Bank had a first lien on the\r\nproperty, with priority over Steffen Robertson and Kirsten (U.S.), Inc.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis action arises out of a dispute regarding the priority of lienholders\r\non&nbsp;real estate owned by George W. Cadle.  The property consisted of \r\napproximately five tracts of land with a total of more than 340 acres in\r\nAllendale County.  Cadle operated the Appleton Sanitary Landfill on a portion\r\nof the land that is now known as the Wastemasters of South Carolina, Inc.\r\nLandfill.\r\n\r\n\tCadle had been doing business with Bank for a number of years. He\r\nexecuted three mortgages on his property in favor of Bank in 1982, 1987, and\r\n1989.\r\n\r\n\tIn 1993, Cadle executed a fourth mortgage on his property in favor of \r\nBank and a 10-year promissory note for $390,000.  The mortgage, dated\r\nSeptember 17, 1993, was recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Court for\r\nAllendale County at Book 82, Page 535.  According to the parties, the fourth\r\nmortgage was actually a consolidation of the three prior mortgages.\r\n\r\n\tIn 1996, Cadle contracted to sell to Wastemasters of South Carolina, Inc.\r\napproximately 306 acres comprising what was formerly the Appleton Sanitary\r\nLandfill.\r\n\r\n As part of the ongoing arrangements in the sale \r\n  to Wastemasters, Cadle wished to extinguish the first three mortgages on the \r\n  property executed in 1982, 1987, and 1989. However, Cadle's attorney prepared \r\n  four Satisfactions of Mortgage for execution by Bank. On June 10, 1996, three \r\n  separate Satisfactions of Mortgage were filed in the Allendale County Clerk's \r\n  Office for the mortgages executed in 1982, 1987, and 1989. In addition, however, \r\n  a fourth Satisfaction of Mortgage was recorded purporting to satisfy a mortgage \r\n  from Cadle to Bank dated September 17, 1983 and was recorded in Mortgage Book \r\n  82, Page 535. As a result, the 1993 mortgage was marked as satisfied of record \r\n  despite the fact that the Satisfaction of Mortgage form contained a typographical \r\n  error stating the mortgage date was September 17, 1983 \r\n  instead of 1993.\r\n\r\n\tIn 1997, Appellants filed mechanics' liens in the Allendale County\r\nClerk's Office, claiming nonpayment for materials and/or services they had\r\nprovided to Wastemasters for improvements to the real property (landfill)\r\nowned by Cadle. (1)  SRK filed an amended mechanic's lien with the clerk's office\r\nseeking the sum of $135,822.07 on June 25, 1997.  E&amp;J filed its mechanic's lien\r\nagainst the property for the amount of $341,243.60 on May 12, 1997.\r\n\r\n\tThe problem in this case arose when Bank realized it had mistakenly\r\nmarked the fourth mortgage, executed in 1993, as satisfied when only the first\r\nthree mortgages should have been satisfied.  After Bank realized its mistake,\r\nCadle executed a new mortgage in favor of Bank on the same property described\r\nin the original mortgages.  It was recorded in the clerk's office on December 23,\r\n1997.\r\n\r\n\tIn October 1998, Bank filed this mortgage foreclosure action, asserting\r\nCadle had executed a note with an unpaid balance due of $277,741.15, plus\r\ninterest, attorney's fees, and costs, which was secured by a 1993 mortgage that\r\nwas \"re-recorded\" in 1997. (2)  Bank asked that its mortgage be foreclosed and\r\ndeclared a first lien on the property, with the liens of the Appellants designated\r\njunior to its mortgage.\r\n\r\n\tAppellants SRK and E&amp;J each answered and asserted their liens were\r\nsuperior to Bank's. In November 1999, the matter was referred to a special\r\nreferee to enter a final order with direct appeal to this court.\r\n\r\n\tThe referee found Bank's 1993 mortgage was satisfied by mistake and that\r\nneither of the Appellants had relied on Bank's satisfaction of the mortgage in\r\nproviding improvements to the property.  The referee concluded that, as a matter\r\nof equity, Bank's mortgage should be reinstated as a first lien on the property\r\nwith Appellants' mechanics' liens being junior in priority to Bank's lien. \r\nAppellants appeal, asserting  Bank's mortgage was not entitled to priority over\r\ntheir mechanics' liens. (3)\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n An action to foreclose a real estate mortgage \r\n  and for cancellation of a mortgage satisfaction on the basis of mistake lies \r\n  in equity. First Palmetto Sav. Bank v. Patel, 344 S.C. 179, 183, 543 \r\n  S.E.2d 241, 243 (Ct. App. 2001). Thus, this Court has jurisdiction to determine \r\n  the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  Id.; see also Dockside Ass'n v. Detyens, 294 S.C. 86, 88, 362 \r\n  S.E.2d 874, 875 (1987) (\"An action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is one \r\n  in equity. In equity cases, we may find facts in accordance with our own view \r\n  of the evidence.\").\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Priority of Bank's Mortgage\r\n\r\n\tAppellants first contend the referee erred in ruling they were not entitled\r\nto priority as they were first to file their liens pursuant to Section 30-7-10 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code.  We find no error.\r\n\r\n\tSection 30-7-10 provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\tAll deeds of conveyance of lands, . . . all mortgages . . . of any\r\nreal property, . . . all statutory liens on buildings and lands for\r\nmaterials or labor furnished on them, . . . are valid so as to affect the\r\nrights of subsequent creditors (whether lien creditors or simple\r\ncontract creditors), or purchasers for valuable consideration without\r\nnotice, only from the day and hour when they are recorded in the\r\noffice of the register of deeds or clerk of court of the county in\r\nwhich the real property is situated.  In the case of a subsequent\r\npurchaser of real estate, or in the case of a subsequent lien creditor\r\non real estate for valuable consideration without notice, the\r\ninstrument evidencing the subsequent conveyance or subsequent\r\nlien must be filed for record in order for its holder to claim under\r\nthis section as a subsequent creditor or purchaser for value without\r\nnotice, and the priority is determined by the time of filing for\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\n\tSection 30-7-10 sets forth the general rule for priority under the law. \r\nHowever, Bank is asserting equitable grounds for relief from strict application\r\nof the general rule.  Accordingly, we agree with the referee that section 30-7-10\r\nis not determinative of the parties' rights in this instance.\r\n\r\n As this Court recently reiterated: \"Equitable \r\n  principles may be applied to cancel a mortgage satisfaction.\" First Palmetto \r\n  Sav. Bank, 344 S.C. at 183, 543 S.E.2d at 243. This rule has long been recognized \r\n  in South Carolina:\r\n\r\n\tThe principle which underlies all of the reported decisions in this\r\nclass of cases is, when the legal rights of the parties have been\r\nchanged by mistake, equity restores them to their former condition,\r\nwhen it can be done without interfering with any new rights\r\nacquired on the faith and strength of the altered condition of the\r\nlegal rights and without doing injustice to other parties.\r\n\r\nYoung v. Pitts, 155 S.C. 414, 420, 152 S.E. \r\n  640, 642 (1930) (quoting Lumber Exch. Bank v. Miller, 40 N.Y.S. 1073 \r\n  (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1896)). \"Thus, a mortgage that has been mistakenly satisfied \r\n  may be reinstated only where there is no third party who, without notice of \r\n  the mistake, subsequently and in good faith acquires an interest in the property.\" \r\n  First Palmetto Sav. Bank, 344 S.C. at 184, 543 S.E.2d at 243; see \r\n  also Young, 155 S.C. at 420, 152 S.E. at 642 (\"[A] satisfaction entered \r\n  through mistake does not destroy the priority of the mortgage unless others \r\n  are misled and injured thereby.\").\r\n\r\n\tAt the hearing in the case before us, John Harter, president of Bank,\r\ntestified he understood Cadle's property was being purchased and that the buyer\r\nhad requested Cadle to satisfy all old mortgages of record.  Harter testified the\r\nSeptember 17, 1993 mortgage was a consolidation of the prior mortgages and\r\nthat he was not authorized, nor did he intend, to satisfy the September 17, 1993\r\nmortgage, as the note securing this mortgage had not been paid.  Harter further\r\nstated Cadle's attorney prepared and presented to him four Satisfaction of\r\nMortgage forms purporting to satisfy mortgages from 1982, 1983, 1987, and\r\n1989.  After examining the satisfaction forms and finding none of them\r\npurported to satisfy a mortgage from the 1990s, Harter executed the forms\r\nwhich were then recorded by Cadle's attorney.\r\n\r\n\tHarter stated if any of the mortgage satisfaction forms had been dated  \r\n1993, he never would have signed them. Harter acknowledged he did not\r\npersonally check  Bank's vault to see how many old mortgages Bank held, but\r\nhe knew the most recent mortgage was exectued in the 1990s when he started\r\nworking at Bank, and that all of the satisfaction forms he was signing were for\r\nmortgages dated in the 1980s.\r\n\r\n\tThe only witness to testify for the Appellants, Ed Salisbury, president of\r\nE&amp;J, stated that his firm started working for Wastemasters on the landfill on\r\nCadle's property around August or September of 1995.  Further, Salisbury\r\nexpressly acknowledged the presence or absence of a mortgage would not have\r\naffected his work on the property.\r\n\r\n We agree with the special referee's findings that \r\n  Bank's satisfaction of the 1993 mortgage was by mistake and that Appellants \r\n  have failed to show any detrimental reliance or prejudice resulting from the \r\n  mistaken filing of the satisfaction. E&amp;J's and SRK's interests were created \r\n  in the Wastemasters's landfill at the time the labor was performed or the material \r\n  furnished. See Shelley Constr. Co. v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. \r\n  24, 26, 336 S.E.2d 488, 489 (Ct. App. 1985) (Inchoate liens arise for debt due \r\n  for labor performed or materials furnished when labor is performed or materials \r\n  furnished.); Charleston Lumber Co. v. GPT, 303 S.C. 350, 353, 400 S.E.2d \r\n  508, 510 (Ct. App. 1991) (Mechanic's lien arises, inchoate, when labor is performed \r\n  or material furnished, but to be valid it must be perfected and enforced in \r\n  accordance with Mechanic's Lien statutes). Although Appellants did perform work \r\n  on the property, there is no evidence that either of them performed a check \r\n  of the title to the property prior to undertaking to do any work on the premises. \r\n  Since none of the mortgage satisfactions were filed until June 1996 and the \r\n  1993 mortgage was still of record at the time Appellants obtained liens on the \r\n  property, there could have been no reliance on the mistaken satisfaction prior \r\n  to furnishing labor or materials to improve the property.\r\n\r\n SRK argued for the first time at oral argument \r\n  before this court that its reliance argument is based on the status of the record \r\n  at the time it filed the mechanic's lien action, since there was no mortgage \r\n  on record at this time. SRK contends it would not have expended the money to \r\n  prosecute this action if it was aware that the 1993 mortgage was still on record. \r\n  We find this issue is not preserved for our review because the trial judge never \r\n  ruled on the issue. An issue not raised to or ruled on by the trial court is \r\n  not preserved for appellate review. Schofield v. Richland County Sch. Dist., \r\n  316 S.C. 78, 82, 447 S.E.2d 189, 191 (1994).\r\n\r\n However, even if this issue were preserved, a \r\n  review of the case law provides no support for this argument since the issue \r\n  of reliance on the mistaken satisfaction is viewed at the time the interest \r\n  is created in the property. In this case, the interest was created in the property \r\n  at the time the material or labor was furnished. See Maxwell v. Epton, \r\n  177 S.C. 184, 181 S.E. 16 (1935); Young v. Pitts, 155 S.C. 414, 152 S.E. \r\n  640 (1930);  First Palmetto Sav. Bank v. Patel, 344 S.C. 179, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  241 (Ct. App. 2001); MI Co. v. McLean, 325 S.C. 616, 482 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).\r\n\r\n Consequently, we affirm the referee's determination \r\n  that Bank's 1993 mortgage should be reinstated with priority over any claims \r\n  held by the Appellants. See Young, 155 S.C. at 420, 152 S.E. at 642 (stating \r\n  where the satisfaction of a mortgage is \"entered through mistake, the law regards \r\n  it as never having been entered at all, unless entering the satisfaction brought \r\n  about prejudice to others dealing with the property\").\r\n\r\nII.  Effect of Bank's Negligence\r\n\r\n\tAppellants next argue the referee erred in ruling Bank could assert its\r\npriority despite Bank's own negligence in causing the release of the 1993\r\nmortgage.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n Appellants contend Bank's failure to investigate \r\n  the accuracy of the documents signed by Bank's president was negligent. Appellants \r\n  cite MI Co. v. McLean, 325 S.C. 616, 482 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. App. 1997), \r\n  for the proposition that a mortgagee's negligence in the unintended release \r\n  of a mortgage renders it ineligible to seek reinstatement of the instrument. \r\n  Based on their assertion that negligence is a bar to equitable relief, Appellants \r\n  maintain the priority of Bank's mortgage should be calculated from the time \r\n  the 1997 mortgage was filed, thus rendering Bank's mortgage lien junior to their \r\n  liens.\r\n\r\n Appellants specifically quote the following language \r\n  from MI Co., in support of their arguments:\r\n\r\n[W]here the mortgage cancellation is attributable \r\n  to the mortgagee who . . . makes the fraud possible through his negligence, \r\n  the court will not interfere to protect the mortgagee at the expense of the \r\n  innocent person deceived by the fraud. In the equitable principle involved, \r\n  use of the concept \"negligence\" refers to lax conduct on the part of one innocent \r\n  party, but for which the other innocent party would have been protected from \r\n  the deceit.\r\n\r\nId. at 624-25, 482 S.E.2d at 602 (citation \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n Contrary to Appellants' assertion, the negligence \r\n  of the mortgagee does not automatically result in denial of equitable relief. \r\n  Rather, the test is whether there has been reliance by an innocent third party \r\n  on the mistaken satisfaction. See, e.g., Young, 155 S.C. at 420-21, \r\n  152 S.E. at 642 (referencing cases holding that \"where the holder of a note \r\n  secured by a mortgage, by his own fault caused the satisfaction of the mortgage \r\n  of record, he was, nevertheless, entitled to have the mortgage reinstated as \r\n  against the mortgagor and subsequent creditors, who had no knowledge of the \r\n  release and were not induced thereby to extend credit on the faith of the real \r\n  estate being unencumbered.\") (citing Stanley v. Valentine, 79 Ill. 544 \r\n  (1875) and McConnell v. Bank, 103 N.E. 809 (Ind. App. 1914)).\r\n\r\n\tWe find that Appellants are unable to establish their reliance upon Bank's\r\nmistaken satisfaction.  We note that the only witness to testify on behalf of\r\nAppellants stated there was  no reliance on the records in Allendale County\r\nbefore performing work at the landfill, and his work was unaffected by whether\r\nor not a mortgage existed on the property.   Accordingly, we find any negligence\r\non the part of Bank did not irrevocably destroy its entitlement to equitable relief.\r\n\r\nIII.  Bank's Alleged Misconduct\r\n\r\n\tAppellants finally contend the referee erred in ignoring Bank's inequitable \r\nconduct in this matter.  Appellants assert that, since Bank is seeking relief in\r\nequity, its conduct is subject to equitable principles and Bank is not entitled to\r\npriority of its mortgage.  We find no error.\r\n\r\n\tAppellants contend the problem with the mortgages arose in this case only\r\nbecause Bank failed in 1993 to release the three existing mortgages that were\r\nbeing consolidated into the 1993 instrument.  They assert Bank's failure to do\r\nso was not the result of mistake or negligence.  Rather, it was \"a calculated\r\ndecision by Bank that contributed to a commission of fraud and deceit by Mr.\r\nCadle upon his creditors.\"\r\n\r\n\tBank's chairman, Walker R. Harter, admitted during his testimony that \r\nBank was aware Cadle wanted to leave the three superseded mortgages in place,\r\napparently because he had some outstanding judgments and he wanted his\r\ncreditors to believe they were further down the priority chain than they really\r\nwere.  According to Harter, Bank accommodated Cadle because he was a long-term customer.\r\n\r\n We find the issue is not preserved for our review. \r\n  Initially, we note Appellants failed to plead the doctrine of \"unclean hands\" \r\n  as an affirmative defense in their answers. See Rock Hill Nat'l Bank v. Honeycutt, \r\n  289 S.C. 98, 104, 344 S.E.2d 875, 879 (Ct. App. 1986) (Because the theory of \r\n  unclean hands was not pled or raised to trial judge it could not be raised on \r\n  appeal.); see also Dye v. Gainey, 320 S.C. 65, 70, 463 S.E.2d 97, 100 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (Goolsby, J., concurring and dissenting) (\"The majority in a \r\n  footnote discounts Dye's failure to appeal the trial court's reliance on the \r\n  doctrine of unclean hands, implying this reliance was improper because Gainey \r\n  had not yet filed a responsive pleading and never raised the doctrine as an \r\n  affirmative defense.\"); see also Rule 8(c), SCRCP (requiring \"any other \r\n  matter constituting an avoidance\" to be pled affirmatively).\r\n\r\n In addition, the referee did not specifically \r\n  rule on this allegation in his detailed order and there is no indication it \r\n  was raised in a motion to alter or amend the judgment. Although there was some \r\n  testimony at trial regarding Bank's motivation for allowing the three prior \r\n  mortgages to remain on the record after the fourth mortgage was recorded in \r\n  1993, we can find no specific assertion by Appellants that Bank should not be \r\n  allowed to have priority on the basis of \"unclean hands,\" as it now asserts \r\n  on appeal. See Holy Loch Distribs. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 \r\n  S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000) (\"In order to preserve an issue for appellate review, \r\n  the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.\"); First \r\n  Union Nat'l Bank v. Hitman, Inc., 306 S.C. 327, 331 n.5, 411 S.E.2d 681, \r\n  683 n.5 (Ct. App. 1991) (noting Hitman's \"unclean hands\" defense that the bank \r\n  had acted inequitably in conducting a sale was not preserved where Hitman never \r\n  objected to the sale on this basis and \"did not make this specific defensive \r\n  argument to the trial judge although its witnesses did complain about the delay[,] \r\n  the trial judge did not rule on it[,] and Hitman did not file a post-trial motion \r\n  to obtain a ruling\").\r\n\r\n In any event, even assuming Appellants' argument \r\n  concerning Bank's inequitable conduct were preserved, Appellants are unable \r\n  to demonstrate any prejudice in this regard. The only defense witness to testify, \r\n  Ed Salisbury, the president of E&amp;J, testified that he did not rely on the \r\n  presence or absence of the mortgages in deciding whether to render services \r\n  and/or materials which were the basis for his company's mechanic's lien. See \r\n  Wilson v. Landstrom, 281 S.C. 260, 267, 315 S.E.2d 130, 134 (Ct. App. 1984) \r\n  (\"Since prejudice to the defendant is a necessary element of the 'unclean hands' \r\n  defense, the doctrine cannot bar relief on the facts before us.\"). Accordingly, \r\n  we find this argument affords no basis for reversal.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the referee is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\t\tSTILWELL and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.   The evidence contained in the record shows that E&amp;J began its work for\r\nWastemasters on the landfill in August or September 1995.  SRK entered into\r\na contract with Wastemasters on or about December 8, 1995 to furnish services\r\nfor the landfill.\r\n2.   The complaint states the 1993 mortgage secured a note executed by\r\nCadle on February 23, 1998, and the note was attached to the complaint. \r\nAccording to the referee's order, the 1998 note was a renewal of the prior note\r\nmade after Bank reinstated its mortgage in 1997.\r\n3.

Hawkins (\"Mother\") appeals an order awarding \r\n  custody of the parties' minor child, Benjamin David Sims (\"Benjamin\"), to Joseph \r\n  K. Jumper (\"Father\"). We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nBenjamin was born on January 13, 1991, and is the \r\n  biological child of Mother and Father. The parties never married. Mother was \r\n  awarded custody of Benjamin on September 22, 1995. Father commenced this action \r\n  on June 29, 1998, seeking a change of custody.\r\n\r\nThe Family Court held a pre-trial conference on \r\n  May 14, 1999, approximately 10 months before the trial date. Following this \r\n  conference, the judge issued an order, which memorialized the issues before \r\n  the court. The order also stated that \"[n]o witnesses may be added ten (10) \r\n  days before trial and the witness list will be exchanged between the parties \r\n  ten (10) days before trial.\" Counsel for both parties were present at the pre-trial \r\n  conference, and these same attorneys represented the parties at trial.\r\n\r\nWhen the trial began on March 7, 2000, Mother made \r\n  a motion to add Dr. Lisa Jackel, a psychologist, as a witness. Mother stated \r\n  that Father was informed of this witness as early as February 11, 2000. \r\n  On that date, Mother's counsel told Father's counsel he had retained \r\n  Dr. Jackel to testify. Father's counsel had also been advised of the witness' \r\n  existence by letter faxed to him from Mother's counsel on February 28 or 29, \r\n  2000. Upon receiving the fax, Father's counsel wrote on the face of it, \"I object \r\n  to this witness,\" signed it, and returned it. At trial, Father opposed Mother's \r\n  motion to allow the witness to testify.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In denying the motion, the Family Court judge stated:\r\n\r\n  I don't take lightly deviation from the Rules, \r\n    and only in certain circumstances where there's absolute necessity for it \r\n    and there's been no fault shown or there's been diligence shown by the parties \r\n    â€¦. I don't view this as one of those situations. We have a pretrial order \r\n    that stands in this case. The Court's going to adhere to that â€¦. I'm going \r\n    to deny the motion. We're going to proceed with the case as set, adhering \r\n    to the witness list that has been previously sent to the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother's counsel moved for reconsideration, which \r\n  the Family Court denied. In his ruling, the judge stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Well, I can reconsider; and I'll give you the same \r\n    results. I believe I've taken great pain to explain to you how the Court views \r\n    the Rules of Practice; and to allow it to be treated as something other than \r\n    that clearly would undermine even the professionalism of the lawyers coming \r\n    before the Court. I take this as a very serious matter.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  â€¦[Y]ou've really not given me any reason to deviate \r\n    from the standard protocol. We have a standard pretrial order; I'm going to \r\n    adhere to it. And that's what this case is going to be about. So I deny your \r\n    motion after reconsidering your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy order filed May 4, 2000, the Family Court awarded \r\n  Father permanent custody of Benjamin. Mother subsequently moved to amend the \r\n  judgment and for a new trial. The Family Court judge denied Mother's motions \r\n  in an order filed June 26, 2000. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Family Court err in excluding Mother's \r\n  expert witness from testifying?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSanction: Exclusion of a \r\n  Witness\r\n\r\nMother argues the Family Court erred in strictly \r\n  adhering to the pre-trial order and not allowing her to call Dr. Jackel as an \r\n  expert witness. We agree and find the judge did not consider all of the relevant \r\n  factors when excluding the witness. \r\n\r\nA veracious review of this issue requires an examination \r\n  of the rules and principles that govern pre-trial procedure in our state. Rule \r\n  16(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure concerns orders issued \r\n  by the trial judge at the pre-trial stage:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pre-trial Orders. The court \r\n    shall make a written order which recites the action, if any, taken at the \r\n    hearing, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the agreements made \r\n    by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and which limits the issues \r\n    for trial to those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of counsel; \r\n    and such order when entered controls the subsequent course of the action, \r\n    unless modified on motion, or at the trial to prevent manifest \r\n    injustice. The order may, in the court's discretion, \r\n    also: (1) provide that exhibits or witnesses not listed at the \r\n    hearing may not be called or admitted in evidence at the trial, unless such \r\n    witness or exhibit is discovered after pre-trial hearing and promptly disclosed \r\n    to opposing parties; (2) provide that all motions pending at \r\n    the time of the hearing which are not presented for disposition are deemed \r\n    abandoned; (3) provide that all or part of the pre-trial hearing be continued \r\n    to a future time, or that additional pre-trial hearings be scheduled to promote \r\n    the orderly and efficient disposition of the action.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe Family Court expressly recognizes the Rules \r\n  of Civil Procedure. See Rule 2, SCRFC(a) (\"In addition to the rules set \r\n  forth in Sections I, II and III of these Rules of Family Court, the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure (SCRCP) shall be applicable in domestic relations actions \r\n  to the extent permitted by Rule 81, SCRCP.&quot;) This recognition, however, \r\n  is not without exception. See id.  (\"The following SCRCP, however, shall \r\n  be inapplicable: 5(a) to the extent it does not require notice to a defendant \r\n  of every hearing, 8(d) to the extent it provides that the failure to file a \r\n  responsive pleading constitutes an admission, 12(b) to the extent it permits \r\n  a 12(b)(6) motion to be converted to a summary judgment motion, 12(c), 13(j), \r\n  18, 23, 38, 39, 40(a &amp; b), 42 to the extent it refers to trial by jury, \r\n  43(b)(1) to the extent it limits the use of leading questions to cross-examination, \r\n  43(i &amp; j), 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 54(c) to the extent it permits the court \r\n  to grant relief not requested in the pleadings, 55, 56, 68, 69, 71, 72, 78, \r\n  79, and 84.\"). Rule 16, SCRCP is not excluded by virtue of Rule 2(a), SCRFC. \r\n  Therefore, Rule 16, SCRCP is applicable in the Family Court's domestic dispute \r\n  setting.\r\n\r\nRule 16, SCRCP is imbued with discretion to be \r\n  exercised by the Family Court judge to prevent \"manifest injustice.\" Additionally, \r\n  Rule 16, SCRCP specifically references \"the court's discretion.\" See \r\n  James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure  137 (\"The language \r\n  of [Rule 16, SCRCP], particularly the \"manifest injustice\" standard for modifying \r\n  the order, suggests that good reason should be required for any changes. The \r\n  order should not be followed blindly.\").\r\n\r\nFormer Circuit Court Rule 43 is the forerunner \r\n  to Rule 16, SCRCP. In Hodge v. Myers, 255&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;542, 180 S.E.2d \r\n  203 (1971), the Supreme Court considered whether the trial court had the authority \r\n  to direct Myers and the other defendants to divulge the names and addresses \r\n  of persons defendants knew had information concerning the accident precipitating \r\n  the litigation. In its response, the Court analyzed the governing procedural \r\n  rule -- Rule 43 -- and the broad discretion it placed in trial judges involving \r\n  pre-trial matters:\r\n\r\n\r\n  We hold that when a case reaches the pretrial conference \r\n    stage the trial judge has a broad authority, both inherent and under Rule \r\n    43, to accomplish those things enumerated in the rule, and to expedite the \r\n    case such that it may go forward without unusual delay. \r\n\r\n  â€¦.\r\n\r\n  â€¦At the pretrial conference stage the judge and \r\n    counsel may consider 'the limitation of the number of witnesses.' If the judge \r\n    is to attempt to limit the number of witnesses he is, as a matter of discretion, \r\n    entitled to require the names and addresses of persons who have information \r\n    helpful to disposition of the case. Counsel is likewise entitled to this information.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 546-47, 180 S.E.2d at 205-06 (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nThe Hodge Court also discussed the efficacy \r\n  and importance of pre-trial conferences:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The purposes of pretrial conferences are to expedite \r\n    trials or shorten the actual period of trial, to narrow or simplify the issues, \r\n    to eliminate the doing of useless things and to facilitate the attainment \r\n    of justice between the parties. Pretrial conferences are designed to prevent \r\n    surprise and eliminate maneuvering; to encourage the settlement of cases in \r\n    advance of the formal trial; to limit the issues for trial to those not disposed \r\n    of by admissions or agreements of counsel; to avoid unnecessary proof of facts \r\n    at the trial; to avoid the evil of submitting a complicated case to the jury \r\n    in such a manner as to be incomprehensible to the jury; to compel the factual \r\n    truth in the controversy short of invading the private, separate counsel of \r\n    the parties; to amend the pleadings where necessary or to dispose of possible \r\n    amendments of the pleadings; to obtain agreements concerning material evidence; \r\n    to procure the presentation and identification of papers, documents, and exhibits \r\n    of various kinds in advance of the formal trial; to determine the number of \r\n    expert witnesses; and, in general, to do whatever may be reasonably necessary \r\n    to facilitate and shorten the formal trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 547, 180 S.E.2d at 206 (quoting 88 \r\n  C.J.S. Trial Â§ 17(2) (1955)).\r\n\r\nIn addition to Rule 16, SCRCP, we examine several \r\n  cases involving disclosure of witnesses decided under the previous Circuit Court \r\n  Rule 90. (1) In Laney v. Hefley, 262 S.C. \r\n  54, 202 S.E.2d 12 (1974) -- decided under former Circuit Court Rule 90 -- our \r\n  Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 90(f) provides the procedure to be followed \r\n    when a party fails to respond to interrogatories but the Rule contains no \r\n    express provision to govern the trial court â€¦ in dealing with the particular \r\n    noncompliance with which we are here concerned [failure to disclose four witnesses \r\n    in answers to interrogatories] â€¦. The weight of authority is to the effect \r\n    that such matters, of necessity, have to be left largely to the discretion \r\n    of the trial court. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 58, 202 S.E.2d at 14. \r\n\r\nThe Court added, \"It is impossible to lay down \r\n  any rule as to the proper course to be followed under such circumstances, and \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court should be respected.\" Id. \r\n  at 59, 202 S.E.2d at 14 (quoting 2A Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice \r\n  &amp; Procedure  Â§ 776 (Wright ed. 1969)).\r\n\r\nThe Laney Court outlined the general rule \r\n  regarding testimony of an\r\n\r\nundisclosed witness:\r\n\r\n\r\n  We hold that the exclusion of a witness whose \r\n    name is not given in answer to an interrogatory calling for it is but one \r\n    of the discretionary powers committed to a trial judge for the proper conduct \r\n    of litigation â€¦. We further hold that there is no mandatory rule \r\n    requiring the trial court to exclude a witness whose name is not given, but \r\n    that the trial court is under a duty, when the situation arises, to delay \r\n    the trial for the purpose of ascertaining the type of witness involved and \r\n    the content of his evidence, the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal \r\n    to furnish the witness' name, and the degree of surprise to the other party, \r\n    including prior knowledge of the name by said party.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 59-60, 202 S.E.2d at 14 (quoting \r\n  Wright v. Royse, 193 N.E.2d 340, 350 (Ill. App. Ct. 1963)) (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nThe same factors were cited and used in an analysis \r\n  involving exclusion of a witness in Moran v. Jones, 281 S.C. 270, 315 \r\n  S.E.2d 136 (Ct. App. 1984). In Moran, this Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Exclusion of a witness is a sanction which should \r\n    never be lightly invoked. Before so ruling, the trial court has a \r\n    duty to ascertain the type witness involved, the content of his evidence, \r\n    the nature of failure, neglect or refusal to furnish the witness's name, and \r\n    the degree of surprise to the other party, including any prior knowledge of \r\n    the name by the other party.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 276, 315 S.E.2d at 139 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Our Supreme Court has additionally ruled: \r\n\r\n  When a violation [of Rule 90 involving non-disclosure \r\n    of a witness] is made to appear, it lies within the discretion of the trial \r\n    judge to decide what sanction, if any, should be imposed. The rule \r\n    is 'designed to promote decisions on the merits after a full and fair hearing, \r\n    and the sanction of exclusion of a witness should never be lightly invoked.'\r\n\r\n\r\nJackson v. H &amp; S Oil Co., Inc., 263 \r\n  S.C. 407, 411, 211 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1975) (quoting Carver v. Salt River Valley \r\n  Water Users' Ass'n., 446 P.2d 492, 496 (1968)) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThis sound discretion standard and analysis has \r\n  been used since Rule 90 was repealed. See Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling \r\n  Co., 307 S.C. 426, 415 S.E.2d 590 (Ct. App. 1992), rev'd  on other grounds, \r\n  311 S.C. 43, 426 S.E.2d 756 (1993).\r\n\r\nIn Dunn, this Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The decision of whether or not to allow a witness \r\n    to testify who was not previously listed on answers to interrogatories rests \r\n    within the sound discretion of the trial judge. In deciding whether to allow \r\n    such a witness to testify, the trial judge should consider the reason the \r\n    new information was not provided earlier, the purpose of the new information \r\n    and the prejudice to the opposing party.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 432, 415 S.E.2d at 593 (citation \r\n  omitted); see also Reed v. Clark, 277 S.C. 310, 316, 286 S.E.2d \r\n  384, 388 (1982) (\"Disclosure of information between the parties before trial \r\n  is designed to avoid surprise and to promote decisions on the merits after a \r\n  full and fair hearing.\") (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the Family Court judge had \r\n  a duty to review and evaluate the proposed witness using the factors listed \r\n  in the cases discussed above. Although the present case involves a party's failure \r\n  to comply with a pre-trial order requiring disclosure of a witness, rather than \r\n  failure to comply with court rules relating to disclosure of a witness, we find \r\n  the situations are similar enough to require the judge to employ the Laney \r\n  factors in making his decision. In both instances, the party has a duty to timely \r\n  disclose information as required by the court, whether it be through a court \r\n  rule or court order.\r\n\r\nThe court knew: (1) Dr. Jackel, a psychologist, \r\n  was Mother's proposed witness; and (2) would be offered as an expert. Thus, \r\n  the court met its duty in ascertaining the type of witness involved. Laney \r\n  v. Hefley, 262 S.C. 54, 59, 202 S.E.2d 12 (1974).\r\n\r\nMother never offered any details of Dr. Jackel's \r\n  testimony, nor did she attempt to proffer the testimony. However, the court \r\n  never made an inquiry into the content of the evidence Dr. Jackel would offer. \r\n  By not getting any information about the proposed witness' \r\n  testimony, the court did not meet its duty of discovering and evaluating the \r\n  content of the potential evidence. Id.\r\n\r\nThe trial court must also consider the nature of \r\n  the failure, neglect, or refusal to furnish the witness' name and the degree \r\n  of surprise to the other party, including any prior knowledge of the name by \r\n  the other party. Id. On February 11, 2000, Mother's counsel told Father's counsel \r\n  that Mother had retained Dr. Jackel to testify for the Defendant. On February \r\n  28 or 29, Mother's counsel informed Father's counsel by letter that Dr. Jackel \r\n  should be added to Mother's witness list. Father's counsel faxed her the letter \r\n  back stating his objection. In this instance, there was no failure, neglect \r\n  or refusal to furnish the witness' name. The imbroglio \r\n  was that Mother did not comply with the pre-trial order. The degree of surprise \r\n  to Father, if any, was minimal, as he had prior knowledge of Dr. Jackel in writing \r\n  by February 29, 2000, at the latest. Although the trial judge had this information, \r\n  there is no indication that he considered it in making his ruling.\r\n\r\nHere, there does not appear to be a reason why \r\n  the new information was not provided earlier, especially since Mother knew she \r\n  wanted to call Dr. Jackel before the ten-day limit and even told Father's counsel \r\n  about the witness as early as February 11, 2000. There is nothing in the record \r\n  about the purpose of the witness, and it appears that the court had no information \r\n  regarding this factor. Concerning prejudice to the opposing party, Father was \r\n  unable to take the witness' deposition or otherwise discover what her testimony \r\n  would be. Considering this, the witness' testimony would have arguably prejudiced \r\n  the Father. These were all additional considerations for the trial judge. Dunn, \r\n  307 S.C. at 432, 415 S.E.2d at 593. Nevertheless, there is no evidence to indicate \r\n  he considered them.\r\n\r\nWe do not find the court learned and analyzed all \r\n  of the details and information about Dr. Jackel's proposed testimony, as required \r\n  by our current case law. In its ruling, the court focused on the pre-trial order. \r\n  The court stated as part of its ruling, \"We have a pretrial order that stands \r\n  in this case. The Court's going to adhere to that. The Court's going to â€¦ use \r\n  that as the protocol to efficiently and effectively hear the issues in this \r\n  day and a half case that's been set.\" Although the pre-trial order was a consideration, \r\n  the court erred by focusing solely on the order in making its decision. Rather, \r\n  the court should also have considered the factors relevant to exclusion of a \r\n  witness.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold that even in the face of a pre-trial order mandating the disclosure of a witness by a certain\r\ndate, a trial judge is required to consider and evaluate the following factors before imposing the\r\nsanction of exclusion of a witness:\r\n\r\n\r\n  the type of witness involved;\r\n\r\n  the content of the evidence emanating from the proffered witness;\r\n\r\n  the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to furnish the witness' name;\r\n\r\n  the degree of surprise to the other party, including the prior knowledge of the name of the\r\nwitness; and\r\n\r\n  the prejudice to the opposing party.\r\n\r\nThe record provides no indication that the trial judge adequately considered these factors when\r\ndeciding to exclude the witness.  Thus, the decision of the Family Court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Morgan, of Aiken, for\r\nRespondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Ray Edward Hook appeals his conviction for driving under the influence, third\r\noffense.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nWhile driving during the early morning hours of January 15, 1999, Hook was involved in an\r\nautomobile collision with Roger Smith of the Williston Police Department, who was operating a\r\npolice department patrol car.  The investigating trooper, Joseph Cruz, cited Smith for driving too\r\nfast for conditions and charged Hook with driving under the influence.\r\n\r\nBoth Hook and Smith sustained injuries in the accident \r\n  and both were taken to a hospital for treatment. Hook was given two intravenous \r\n  doses of Toradol, a non-narcotic pain killer. The physician also gave Hook a \r\n  prescription for Darvocet, a narcotic pain killer. After Hook received medical \r\n  attention, Cruz arrested him, advised him of his rights under Miranda v. \r\n  Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and took him to the detention center for a \r\n  breathalyzer test. Hook ultimately declined to take the breathalyzer.\r\n\r\nHook was held at the detention center for a number of days.  On the day after the accident, he\r\ncontinued to experience severe pain to his side and chest and began spitting up blood. \r\nUnbeknownst to law enforcement personnel, Hook had in fact suffered a ruptured spleen which\r\nlater required surgical removal.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the accident, Hook's probation \r\n  agent, Judy Brown, spoke with him and asked that he submit to a drug test. Another \r\n  probation agent, Marshall Bunch, administered the test. Neither agent advised \r\n  Hook of his rights under Miranda. After informing Hook he tested positive \r\n  for cocaine, the probation agents questioned him about cocaine usage. According \r\n  to the agents, Hook admitted using cocaine on the night before the accident. \r\n  Brown testified Hook admitted his cocaine use caused the accident.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Hook's attorney argued several grounds for the exclusion from evidence of the drug test\r\nresults and Hook's statement to the probation agents.  Defense counsel moved in limine to exclude\r\nthe test results and statements on the ground the information was privileged under South Carolina\r\nCode Annotated Section 24-21-290 (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nThe court ruled the test results were inadmissible, but the statements were a \"clear admission\r\nagainst [Hook's] interest\" and were, therefore, admissible.\r\n\r\nLater in the trial, the court addressed the issue \r\n  of voluntariness. After conducting a Jackson v. Denno \r\n  (1) hearing, the court ruled the statement was voluntary but privileged \r\n  and thus inadmissible, rejecting Hook's argument the statement was involuntary \r\n  and was taken in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.\r\n\r\nHook testified in his own defense.  He admitted he drank three beers between 5:00 and 7:30 p.m.\r\non January 14, 2000, but denied his ability to drive a car was impaired at the time of the accident. \r\nAt the close of his testimony, the solicitor requested permission to impeach Hook's testimony with\r\nhis statement to the probation agents.  Specifically, the solicitor requested permission to question\r\nHook about drug use, then impeach any denial of drug use with testimony from the probation\r\nagents concerning his statements to them.  The court initially indicated that because Hook took the\r\nstand in reliance on the court's prior ruling that the statement was inadmissible, the solicitor\r\nwould not be allowed to question him about drug use or use his statements for impeachment\r\npurposes.  However, after hearing additional arguments on the issue, the court reversed its position\r\nand ruled the State could use the statements for impeachment.  In reaching this determination, the\r\ncourt reasoned Hook opened the door for impeachment in his testimony.  The court further\r\nreasoned Hook's statements were voluntary inasmuch as he did not assert his privilege to remain\r\nsilent in the face of the probation agents' questions, and the United States Supreme Court had\r\npreviously sanctioned using voluntary, but otherwise inadmissible statements, to impeach a\r\ndefendant when he attempts to commit perjury.\r\n\r\nOn cross examination, over defense counsel's objection, the solicitor questioned Hook about his\r\nstatement to the probation agents.  Hook admitted he told the officers he used powder cocaine \"a\r\ncouple of days before the accident.\"  He denied, however, using cocaine on the night of January\r\n14 prior to the accident during the early morning hours of January 15.  He further denied telling\r\nthe probation agents he used cocaine on the night of the accident or that his cocaine use caused the\r\naccident.  The solicitor then recalled Brown, who recited Hook's alleged statements, thereby\r\ncontradicting Hook's testimony.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Statutory Privilege\r\n\r\nInitially, we address the efficacy of Section 24-21-290 (Supp. 2000), which provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation received by probation agents privileged.\r\n\r\nAll information and data obtained in the discharge of his official duty by a probation agent is\r\nprivileged information, is not receivable as evidence in a court, and may not be disclosed directly\r\nor indirectly to anyone other than the judge or others entitled under this chapter to receive reports\r\nunless ordered by the court or the director.\r\n\r\nElementally, the statute is trifurcated:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  all information and data obtained in the discharge of his official duty by a probation agent is\r\nprivileged information;\r\n\r\n  is not receivable as evidence in a court; and\r\n\r\n  may not be disclosed directly or indirectly to anyone other than the judge or others entitled\r\nunder this chapter to receive reports unless ordered by the court or the director.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends that the language of the statute \r\n  in element three \"ordered by the court\" refers to any court at any time. We \r\n  reject that contention and rule that the statute is clearly and unambiguously \r\n  referencing the court in the probation setting.\r\n\r\nThe defendant argues that the verbiage in the statute in element two \"is not received as evidence in\r\ncourt\" restricts the use of any statements by a probationer to a probation agent except in a\r\nprobation revocation hearing.  We agree.\r\n\r\nFinally, we hold the statute creates an exclusionary \r\n  privilege.\r\n\r\nThe statements made by Hook to the probation officers were nexed to the pending charge\r\ninvolving his custody.\r\n\r\nBecause we dispose of this case under the analysis of a separate issue, we decline to analyze the\r\nutilitarian efficacy of the statute as juxtaposed to factual scenarios involving possible waiver of\r\nthe privilege.\r\n\r\nII.  Statement to Probation Agents-Voluntary/Involuntary\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Hook argues the trial court erred in determining his statement to the probation agents\r\nwas voluntarily made.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \r\n  provides, in relevant part, that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal \r\n  case to be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const. amend V. This provision governs \r\n  state as well as federal criminal proceedings. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. \r\n  1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964). Article 1, Section 12, of the South \r\n  Carolina Constitution contains a similar provision. S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 12 \r\n  ( \". . . nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness \r\n  against himself.\").\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Amendment does not, of course, operate \r\n  as a blanket prohibition against the taking of any and all statements made by \r\n  criminal defendants to law enforcement officials. Volunteered statements, whether \r\n  exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation or spontaneously \r\n  offered up, are not barred by the Fifth Amendment. State v. Kennedy, \r\n  325 S.C. 295, 307, 479 S.E.2d 838, 844 (Ct. App. 1996)(citing Miranda v. \r\n  Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)).\r\n\r\n\"The test for determining the admissibility of \r\n  a statement is whether it was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given \r\n  under the totality of the circumstances.\" State v. Peake, 291 S.C. 138, \r\n  139, 352 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1987); see also State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. \r\n  196, 391 S.E.2d 244 (1990) (trial judge's determination of whether statement \r\n  was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made requires examination of totality \r\n  of circumstances surrounding waiver). The State bears the burden of establishing \r\n  voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If a defendant was advised of his Miranda \r\n    rights, but nevertheless chose to make a statement, the \"burden is on the \r\n    State to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his rights were voluntarily \r\n    waived.\" State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 370 S.E.2d 611 (1988) (emphasis \r\n    in original); State v. Neeley, 271 S.C. 33, 244 S.E.2d 522 (1978). \r\n    The State bears this burden of proof even where a defendant has signed a waiver \r\n    of rights form.... The trial judge's determination of the voluntariness of \r\n    a statement must be made on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, \r\n    including the background, experience and conduct of the accused. State \r\n    v. Linnen, 278 S.C. 175, 293 S.E.2d 851 (1982). The trial judge's resolution \r\n    of the issue will not be disturbed absent an error of law. State v. Atchison, \r\n    268 S.C. 588, 235 S.E.2d 294, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 894, 98 S.Ct. 273, 54 \r\n    L.Ed.2d 181 (1977).\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 137-38, \r\n  382 S.E.2d 911, 913-14 (1989). See also State v. McLeod, \r\n  303 S.C. 420, 423, 401 S.E.2d 175, 177(1991)(The trial court's \"determination \r\n  of the voluntariness of a statement will not be disturbed unless so manifestly \r\n  erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.\"), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  816 (1992).\r\n\r\nIn considering whether a statement was voluntarily \r\n  given, the court must determine the existence or nonexistence of coercive police \r\n  activity. State v. Salisbury, 498 S.E.2d 655, 666, 330 S.C. 250, 272 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998)(\"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding \r\n  a confession is not voluntary within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of \r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment.\")(citing Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, \r\n  167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 521-22, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986)); State v. Linnen, \r\n  278 S.C. 175, 293 S.E.2d 851 (1982)(statements were given freely and voluntarily, \r\n  and were therefore admissible, even though interrogating officers encouraged \r\n  the statements, where officers were not coercive or threatening and statements \r\n  were not procured by improper influence).\r\n\r\nThe concept that the privilege against self-incrimination encompasses the right to be free from\r\nbeing penalized for its exercise is well established.\r\n\r\n\r\n[W]hen a State compels testimony by threatening to inflict potent sanctions unless the\r\nconstitutional privilege is surrendered, that testimony is obtained in violation of the Fifth\r\nAmendment and cannot be used against the declarant in a subsequent criminal prosecution.. . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, our cases have established that a State may not impose substantial penalties because a\r\nwitness elects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 805, \r\n  97 S.Ct. 2132, 2135-36 (1977)(holding the threat of removal from political party \r\n  office for refusal to testify without immunity before a grand jury was coercive); \r\n  see also Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 80, 94 S.Ct. \r\n  316, 322, 324(1973)(threat of loss of public contracts for architects' refusal \r\n  to waive privilege against self-incrimination was penalty amounting to coercion); \r\n  Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 279, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 1916 (1968)( \r\n  holding a police officer could not be discharged from his employment solely \r\n  because he refused to forfeit his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; \r\n  the privilege against compelled self- incrimination could not abide any \"attempt, \r\n  regardless of its ultimate effectiveness, to coerce a waiver of the immunity \r\n  it confers on penalty of the loss of employment.\"); Garrity v. New Jersey, \r\n  385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616,(1967)(threat of discharge from employment as police \r\n  officer for refusal to forfeit privilege against self-incrimination was coercive); \r\n  State v. Osborne, 301 S.C. 363, 367, 392 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1990)(statements \r\n  defendant made after being told she would be charged with withholding evidence \r\n  if she did not make a statement were not voluntary, even though defendant was \r\n  advised of Miranda rights).\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 427, \r\n  104 S.Ct. 1136, 1142 (1984), the Court found that \"the general obligation to \r\n  appear and answer questions [before a probation officer] truthfully did not \r\n  in itself convert Murphy's otherwise voluntary statements into compelled ones.\" \r\n  \"A state may require a probationer to appear and discuss matters that affect \r\n  his probationary status; such a requirement, without more, does not give rise \r\n  to a self-executing privilege.\" Id. at 435, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1146. However, \r\n  the court expressly contemplated:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result may be different if the questions put to the probationer, however relevant to his\r\nprobationary status, call for answers that would incriminate him in a pending or later criminal\r\nprosecution.  There is thus a substantial basis in our cases for concluding that if the state, either\r\nexpressly or by implication, asserts that invocation of the privilege would lead to revocation of\r\nprobation, it would have created the classic penalty situation, the failure to assert the privilege\r\nwould be excused, and the probationer's answers would be deemed compelled and inadmissible in\r\na criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. \r\n\r\nIn contrariety to Murphy, who was not \r\n  in custody, Hook was in jail at the time of the probation \r\n  interview and all of the statements by Hook were made to the probation agent \r\n  in the jail setting. Indisputably, Hook was in custody. \r\n  Hook was not advised of his Miranda warnings \r\n  by the probation agents. The Murphy Court emphasized that Murphy was \r\n  not under arrest and a different question would be presented \r\n  if interviewed by a probation officer in a custodial setting.\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has addressed the \r\n  voluntariness of a statement made while the defendant is in a state of medical \r\n  urgency. In Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 398-99, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 2416-17 \r\n  (1978), the Court found:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to imagine a situation less conducive to the exercise of \"a rational intellect and a free\r\nwill\" than Mincey's.  He had been seriously wounded just a few hours earlier, and had arrived at\r\nthe hospital \"depressed almost to the point of coma,\" according to his attending physician. \r\nAlthough he had received some treatment, his condition at the time of Hust's interrogation  was\r\nstill sufficiently serious that he was in the intensive care unit.  He complained to Hust that the pain\r\nin his leg was \"unbearable.\"  He was evidently confused and unable to think clearly about either\r\nthe events of that afternoon or the circumstances of his interrogation, since some of his written\r\nanswers were on their face not entirely coherent.  Finally, while Mincey was being questioned he\r\nwas lying on his back on a hospital bed, encumbered by tubes, needles, and breathing apparatus. \r\nHe was, in short, \"at the complete mercy\" of Detective Hust, unable to escape or resist the thrust\r\nof Hust's interrogation. (Citations and footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, Brown went to the jail, in her capacity as a probation officer, for the purpose of determining\r\nwhether Hook was in compliance with the terms of his probation sentence prohibiting drug use. \r\nWhen Hook denied using drugs, she ordered a drug test.  Bunch, the agent who administered the\r\ndrug test, also went to the jail in his capacity as a probation agent.  Bunch testified a probationer\r\nmust answer the questions posed to him by probation officers, and stated Hook was aware that\r\nrefusal to take the drug test would constitute a violation of his probation.  In addition, Hook was\r\nsuffering from an undiagnosed ruptured spleen at the time of the interrogation.\r\n\r\nWe hold the facts and circumstances attendant to \r\n  this case amounted to the \"classic penalty case\" the Court alluded to in Minnesota \r\n  v. Murphy. Although there is no evidence the probation agents expressly \r\n  threatened to revoke Hook's probationary sentence if he failed to answer their \r\n  inquiries truthfully, the timing of the interview, the custodial atmosphere, \r\n  and the other attendant circumstances unquestionably raised the implication \r\n  revocation would result from any refusal to cooperate. Moreover, while Hook \r\n  was not suffering from the same level of physical ailments as the defendant \r\n  in Mincey v. Arizona, we find the following language particularly instructive:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There were not present in this case some of the \r\n    gross abuses that have led the Court in other cases to find confessions involuntary, \r\n    such as beatings, see Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 \r\n    S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682, or \"truth serums,\" see Townsend v. Sain, \r\n    372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770. But \"the blood of the accused is \r\n    not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.\" Blackburn v. \r\n    Alabama, 361 U.S., at 206, 80 S.Ct., at 279. Determination of whether \r\n    a statement is involuntary \"requires more than a mere color-matching of cases.\" \r\n    Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 442, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 1547, 6 L.Ed.2d 948. \r\n    It requires careful evaluation of all the circumstances of the interrogation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 401, 98 \r\n  S.Ct. 2408, 2418.\r\n\r\nWe find the totality of the circumstances in this case amounted to coercion egregious enough to\r\nrender any statement Hook made to the probation officers involuntary.\r\n\r\nIII.  Use of Involuntary Incriminating Statement\r\nfor Impeachment Purposes\r\n\r\nWe further hold that because the statements were not voluntarily made, the trial court erred in\r\nallowing their use for any purpose, including impeachment.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a statement obtained in violation of \r\n  the requirements of Miranda may be used for impeachment purposes. \r\n  See Oregon v. Hass, 420 U.S. 714, 721-22 (1975) (statement taken in violation \r\n  of Fifth Amendment right to counsel admissible for impeachment); Harris v. \r\n  New York, 401 U.S. 222, 224-26 (1971) (statement taken without proper Miranda \r\n  warnings admissible for impeachment).\r\n\r\nNonetheless, \"an accused's involuntary incriminating \r\n  statement is inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment.\" State \r\n  v. Victor, 300 S.C. 220, 223, 387 S.E.2d 248, 249 (1989). It is clearly \r\n  the law that the use of an involuntary statement in any manner violates due \r\n  process of law. In Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, \r\n  324(1973), the Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Amendment not only protects the individual \r\n    against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal \r\n    prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to \r\n    him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where \r\n    the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings. McCarthy \r\n    v. Arndstein, 266 U.S. 34, 40, 45 S.Ct. 16, 17, 69 L.Ed. 158 (1924), squarely \r\n    held that '(t)he privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of \r\n    the proceeding in which the testimony is sought or is to be used. It applies \r\n    alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to \r\n    subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. The privilege protects \r\n    a mere witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant.'\r\n\r\n  In this respect, McCarthy v. Arndstein \r\n    reflected the settled view in this Court. The object of the Amendment 'was \r\n    to insure that a person should not be compelled, when acting as a witness \r\n    in any investigation, to give testimony which might tend to show that he himself \r\n    had committed a crime.' Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562, \r\n    12 S.Ct. 195, 198, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892). See also Bram v. United \r\n    States, 168 U.S. 532, 542--543, 18 S.Ct. 183, 186--187, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897); \r\n    Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 16 S.Ct. 644, 40 L.Ed. 819 (1896); Boyd \r\n    v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 634, 637--638, 6 S.Ct. 524, 534, 536--537, \r\n    29 L.Ed. 746 (1886); United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100, 7 L.Ed. \r\n    69 (1828). This is the rule that is now applicable to the States. Malloy \r\n    v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 635 (1964). 'It must be \r\n    considered irrelevant that the petitioner was a witness in a statutory inquiry \r\n    and not a defendant in a criminal prosecution, for it has long been settled \r\n    that the privilege protects witnesses in similar federal inquiries.' Id., \r\n    at 11, 84 S.Ct., at 1495. In any of these contexts, therefore, a witness protected \r\n    by the privilege may rightfully refuse to answer unless and until he is protected \r\n    at least against the use of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom \r\n    in any subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant. Kastigar v. \r\n    United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Absent \r\n    such protection, if he is nevertheless compelled to answer, his answers are \r\n    inadmissible against him in a later criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nLefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77-78, \r\n  94 S.Ct. 316, 322.\r\n\r\nIn Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 397-98, \r\n  98 S.Ct. 2408, 2416 (1978), the United States Supreme Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Statements made by a defendant in circumstances \r\n    violating the strictures of Miranda v. Arizona, supra, are admissible \r\n    for impeachment if their \"trustworthiness . . . satisfies legal standards.\" \r\n    Harris v. New York, supra, 401 U.S., at 224, 91 S.Ct., at 645; Oregon \r\n    v. Hass, supra, 420 U.S., at 722, 95 S.Ct., at 1220. But any criminal \r\n    trial use against a defendant of his involuntary statement is a denial of \r\n    due process of law, \"even though there is ample evidence aside from the confession \r\n    to support the conviction.\" Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. supra, at 376, \r\n    84 S.Ct., at 1780; Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 518, 83 S.Ct. \r\n    1336, 1345, 10 L.Ed.2d 513; Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 537, \r\n    83 S.Ct. 917, 922, 9 L.Ed.2d 922; Stroble v. California, 343 U.S. 181, \r\n    190, 72 S.Ct. 599, 603, 96 L.Ed. 872; see Chapman v. California, 386 \r\n    U.S. 18, 23 and n. 8, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 450 (1979)(prior \r\n  testimony before a grand jury, compelled under a grant of immunity, could not \r\n  be used for impeachment purposes in a subsequent criminal trial).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold that an involuntary \r\n  incriminating statement may not \r\n  be used for any purpose, including impeachment. \r\n  Recognizing the strictures of due process, we hold Hook's conviction for driving \r\n  under the influence, third offense, is\r\n\r\nREVERSED and the case is REMANDED for a NEW TRIAL.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3425","title":"State v.

Pursuant to this investigation, Special Agent Terry Hoffman observed \r\n  Lila Macias and Armando Ramirez, accompanied by Maria Cortez, enter the DMV \r\n  office in Walterboro on April 24, 1998, around 3:00 p.m. Macias, Ramirez, and \r\n  Cortez left the DMV office at approximately 5:00 p.m. and drove away in a car \r\n  driven by Cortez. The Highway Patrol initiated a traffic stop of the car and \r\n  seized brand new driver's licenses from Macias and Ramirez.\r\n\r\nMacias testified she was a native of Mexico and \r\n  worked at a restaurant in Goose Creek. Someone at the restaurant told Macias \r\n  that they knew \"how to get driver's licenses\" and that she could obtain a driver's \r\n  license from the DMV without providing documentation for $1,000. On the afternoon \r\n  of April 24, 1998, Macias and Ramirez met with Cortez and she drove them to \r\n  the Walterboro DMV to obtain driver's licenses. Macias testified she took an \r\n  eye exam, had her photograph taken, and paid the application fee, but did not \r\n  take either a written or driving test. Macias identified Taylor as the individual \r\n  who processed her application and issued her a driver's license. Macias testified \r\n  Taylor never requested her social security card or any immigration papers.\r\n\r\nRamirez, who is also from Mexico, testified he \r\n  traveled to the DMV on April 24, 1998, with Cortez and Macias to obtain a driver's \r\n  license. Ramirez testified that \"[a]nytime someone wanted a license they need \r\n  to call Maria Cortez,\" and that for $1,000 she would assist them in getting \r\n  a license without having to provide any type of documentation. Ramirez was issued \r\n  a license by Taylor without taking a written or driving test and without presenting \r\n  a social security card or other identification.\r\n\r\nJohn Romagando was working undercover for SLED \r\n  on April 24, 1998, and went to the Walterboro DMV to conduct surveillance. Romagando \r\n  observed Macias and Ramirez at the DMV counter where Taylor was working that \r\n  afternoon. Romagando testified he never observed either Macias or Ramirez take \r\n  a driving test. Additionally, Constance Johnson, an employee at the Walterboro \r\n  DMV, testified that she observed Taylor assisting some \"Hispanic\" people on \r\n  the afternoon of April 24th and that she did not see the individuals take a \r\n  driving test.\r\n\r\nSeveral DMV employees testified regarding the procedures \r\n  used to obtain a driver's license in South Carolina. To receive a license, an \r\n  applicant must provide a birth certificate or social security card, take an \r\n  eye examination, and take both a written and driving test. The results of these \r\n  tests are noted on DMV Form 447. Form 447 is then sent from the local DMV to \r\n  the DMV office in Columbia.\r\n\r\nWanda Graham, a DMV field administrator in Columbia, \r\n  testified she was unable to locate a Form 447 for Macias or Ramirez. The DMV's \r\n  computer records did not indicate that any type of application was filled out \r\n  by Macias or Ramirez.\r\n\r\nIn September 1999, Taylor was tried for two counts \r\n  of unlawful issuance of a fictitious motor vehicle driver's license, in violation \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-515(1). At the close of the State's case, Taylor moved \r\n  for a directed verdict and the trial court denied this motion. The jury returned \r\n  guilty verdicts on both counts and Taylor was sentenced by the trial judge.\r\n\r\nOn November 8, 1999, a hearing was held before \r\n  the trial judge regarding Taylor's post-trial motions for a verdict in arrest \r\n  of judgment and for a new trial and entry of judgment of acquittal. On November \r\n  18, 1999, the trial judge issued an order of verdict in arrest of judgment and \r\n  entry of judgment of acquittal. The State appeals this order.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to \r\n  review errors of law. State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 199 S.E.2d 61 (1973). \r\n  \"It is undisputed that the State may appeal where the verdict is set aside wholly \r\n  upon an error of law.\" State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 395, 400, 297 S.E.2d \r\n  414, 417 (1982) (internal emphasis omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State argues the trial court committed an error \r\n  of law in issuing an order of verdict in arrest of judgment and entry of judgment \r\n  of acquittal after the jury returned a verdict finding Taylor guilty of two \r\n  counts of the unlawful issuance of a fictitious motor vehicle driver's license. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nIn a criminal case, \"[t]he only post verdict fact-based \r\n  remedy available â€¦ is a motion for a new trial.\"  State v. Miller, 287 \r\n  S.C. 280, 285, 337 S.E.2d 883, 886 (1985) (Ness, J., concurring in part and \r\n  dissenting in part) (citation omitted); see also State v. Dawkins, 32 \r\n  S.C. 17, 24-25, 10 S.E. 772, 773 (1890) (affirming the trial judge's denial \r\n  of defendant's post-trial motion in arrest of judgment, holding \"the [defendant's] \r\n  remedy would have been by a motion for a new trial, and not by motion in arrest \r\n  of judgment.\"). The trial judge in a criminal matter has no authority to grant \r\n  a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and has only limited authority to issue \r\n  a verdict in arrest of judgment.\r\n\r\nI. Judgment Notwithstanding \r\n  the Verdict (JNOV)\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, we note that a motion for \r\n  a JNOV in a criminal case is not recognized in this state. Miller, 287 \r\n  S.C. at 285, 337 S.E.2d at 886 (Ness, J., concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part) (noting it was improper for trial counsel to move for a JNOV, a civil \r\n  motion, in a criminal trial and pointing out the impropriety of a criminal JNOV). \r\n  Our Supreme Court has held that the trial judge in a criminal case committed \r\n  an error of law in directing a verdict of not guilty after the jury had returned \r\n  a guilty verdict:\r\n\r\nThere is no precedent in this State for such action. \r\n  This is not a case in which a trial judge has granted a new trial upon the facts \r\n  (a power which he admittedly has) but rather one in which a trial judge had \r\n  entered a verdict of not guilty in the face of conflicting evidence (a power \r\n  he has never had in this jurisdiction) â€¦. To affirm this decision is to grant \r\n  unprecedented license to trial judges to invade the area where the jury system \r\n  has been deemed most effective -- that is, in assessing the truthfulness of \r\n  fellow human beings testifying under oath.\r\n\r\nDasher, 278 S.C. at 399-400, 297 S.E.2d \r\n  at 416 (1982) (internal emphasis omitted). There is no precedent that \"gives \r\n  the trial court authority to change its mind after a guilty verdict has been \r\n  returned and thereafter, on its own motion, grant a directed verdict of innocence \r\n  as to the same charge.\" State v. Scurry, 322 S.C. 514, 518, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  61, 63 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nII. Motion for A New Trial\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that the grant or refusal of \r\n  a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Simmons, \r\n  279 S.C. 165, 303 S.E.2d 857 (1983). \"Where there is no evidence to support \r\n  a conviction, an order granting a new trial should be upheld.\" State v. Smith, \r\n  316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993) (citation omitted). \"However, where \r\n  there is competent evidence to sustain the jury's verdict, the judge may not \r\n  substitute his judgment for that of the jury.\" State v. Prince,  316 \r\n  S.C. 57, 63, 447 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1993) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nIII. Verdict in Arrest of \r\n  Judgment and Entry of Judgment of Acquittal\r\n\r\nA trial court in a criminal matter has only limited \r\n  authority to issue a verdict in arrest of judgment: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are two motions available to defense counsel \r\n    following a guilty verdict in a criminal case. He may move for verdict in \r\n    arrest of judgment to prevent entry of judgment on the grounds of the insufficiency \r\n    of the indictment or some other fatal defect appearing on the face of the \r\n    record. He may not move for verdict in arrest of judgment \r\n    based on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the allegations in the \r\n    indictment. Secondly, he may move for a new trial upon the facts. Thus, the \r\n    trial judge has no authority to grant relief on factual grounds after a verdict \r\n    of guilty that is equivalent to the relief he could have granted at the directed \r\n    verdict stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Miller, 287 S.C. 280, 286, 337 \r\n  S.E.2d 883, 886-87 (1985) (Ness, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \r\n  (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original).\r\n\r\nOur courts have recognized the authority of a trial \r\n  court to grant a verdict in arrest of judgment to prevent entry of judgment \r\n  on the insufficiency of the indictment or some other fatal defect appearing \r\n  on the face of the record. Id. at 286, 337 S.E.2d at 886 (Ness, J., concurring \r\n  in part and dissenting in part); State v. Brown, 201 S.C. 417, 23 S.E.2d \r\n  381 (1942) (ruling that motion for arrest in judgment should have been granted \r\n  where trial court did not have jurisdiction to impose sentence); State v. \r\n  Cooler, 30 S.C. 105, 8 S.E. 692 (1889) (finding that the fact a juror was \r\n  a member of the grand jury that indicted defendant was not grounds for arrest \r\n  of judgment); State v. Jeter, 47 S.C. 2, 24 S.E. 889 (1896) (holding \r\n  trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for arrest of judgment where \r\n  indictment was insufficient); State v. Blakeney, 33 S.C. 111, 11 S.E. \r\n  637 (1890) (affirming trial court's denial of defendant's motion for arrest \r\n  of judgment where indictment was sufficient). However, a defendant \"may not \r\n  move for verdict in arrest of judgment based on the sufficiency of the evidence \r\n  to sustain the allegations in the indictment.\" Miller, 287 S.C. at 286,\r\n\r\n337 S.E.2d at 886-87 (Ness, J., concurring in part \r\n  and dissenting in part) (citing\r\n\r\nState v. Hamilton, 17 S.C. 462 (1882) (emphasis \r\n  in the original).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A \"motion for arrest of judgment\" is a postverdict \r\n    motion made to prevent the entry of a judgment where the charging document \r\n    is insufficient or the court lacked jurisdiction to try the matter. It has \r\n    been held that a motion in arrest of judgment is distinguishable from a motion \r\n    to quash an indictment, in that reasons sufficient to sustain the quashing \r\n    of an indictment may be insufficient to sustain a motion in arrest of judgment. \r\n    However, it has also been held that a motion in arrest of judgment is a post-trial \r\n    motion to quash an indictment. \r\n\r\n  â€¦[W]hen ruling on a motion in arrest of judgment, \r\n    the trial court is limited to rectifying trial errors, and cannot \r\n    make a redetermination of the credibility and weight of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21 Am Jur. 2d Criminal Law Â§785 (1998) (emphasis \r\n  added) (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nIn the present action, Taylor was indicted and \r\n  tried for the unlawful issuance of fictitious motor vehicle driver's licenses \r\n  pursuant to Â§ 56-1-515(1), which provides that \"[i]t is unlawful for any person \r\n  to alter a motor vehicle driver's license so as to provide false information \r\n  on the license or to sell or issue a fictitious driver's license.\" Taylor contends \r\n  the trial court's order granting her motion for verdict in arrest of judgment \r\n  was proper because the State failed to produce sufficient evidence that she \r\n  \"issued\" the license, or that they were \"fictitious.\" Because it is inappropriate \r\n  for the trial court to grant a motion of a verdict in arrest of judgment based \r\n  on the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court erred in granting Taylor's \r\n  motion. Moreover, the State presented sufficient evidence that Taylor issued \r\n  the fictitious licenses in violation of Â§ 56-1-515. Both Macias and Ramirez \r\n  testified they obtained a driver's license from Taylor without providing proper \r\n  identification, documentation, or taking the written and driving examinations; \r\n  therefore, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the driver's \r\n  licenses were fictitious and that Taylor issued them. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold that a circuit judge may issue an order \r\n  granting a POST-TRIAL motion for a VERDICT \r\n  IN ARREST OF JUDGMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL to prevent \r\n  entry of judgment on the grounds of the insufficiency of the indictment or some \r\n  other fatal defect appearing on the face of the record. The circuit judge may \r\n  NOT issue an order granting a VERDICT IN \r\n  ARREST OF JUDGMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL based on \r\n  the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the allegation in the indictment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial court's order \r\n  and reinstate Taylor's convictions.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3426","title":"State v.

He was sentenced to seventeen years \r\n  imprisonment. Crosby asserts three errors on appeal. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 1998, Crosby and his girlfriend, \r\n  Ketura Young, were visiting Monica Tucker in an apartment Monica shared with \r\n  Shawanda Knox, and Shawanda's brother, Ryan Knox. Several other people, including \r\n  Lavaris Dunham (\"the victim\"), were also visiting the apartment. When Shawanda \r\n  and Ryan returned home from work with Jessica Herring, a co-worker, Shawanda \r\n  became upset with the number of people in the apartment and wanted them to leave. \r\n  Monica refused to ask her guests to leave. Shawanda left and went to a nearby \r\n  apartment where she called the police to intervene.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Crosby became upset when the \r\n  victim commented that he could \"take\" Crosby's girlfriend. Crosby yelled at \r\n  the victim, pointed at Ketura, and told the victim to go ahead and try. The \r\n  victim apologized to Crosby for upsetting him, and Crosby walked outside the \r\n  apartment to \"cool off.\" Deputy Ernest Nesbitt of the Kershaw County Sheriff's \r\n  Office approached the apartment in response to Shawanda's call as Crosby exited \r\n  the apartment. Deputy Nesbitt heard Crosby mention that he needed to \"clear \r\n  his head.\"\r\n\r\nDeputy Nesbitt attempted to resolve the disagreement \r\n  between the roommates. Shawanda, who had returned after calling the police, \r\n  again left the apartment upon Deputy Nesbitt's advice. The deputy then departed. \r\n  Shawanda returned again to retrieve some of her belongings. An argument between \r\n  Shawanda and Monica ensued, which escalated into a physical altercation outside \r\n  the apartment involving Shawanda, Monica, Ryan, and Monica's cousin, Jenelle \r\n  Outten. During the fight, Crosby shot the victim in the neck in the open doorway \r\n  of the apartment. The victim died from his injuries. \r\n\r\nCrosby and several others fled the scene in Jessica's \r\n  car. Crosby averred several times to the occupants of the car that he did not \r\n  intend to shoot the victim. The next morning, Crosby turned himself in to the \r\n  police. He gave a statement that the victim charged at him while he was attempting \r\n  to help break up the fight between Shawanda and the others. Crosby stated that \r\n  when the victim charged him, he \"seen (sic) his life in danger\" and took his \r\n  gun out of his pocket, closed his eyes, and pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Calvin Hill testified he was inside the \r\n  apartment when he witnessed Crosby attempting to break up the fight. Hill saw \r\n  the victim exit the apartment and approach Crosby. Hill heard Crosby telling \r\n  the victim to back up, and then Crosby walked into the apartment. According \r\n  to Hill, the victim then \"charged\" at Crosby with his hands up and without any \r\n  weapons in them. Hill heard the gunshot as both men were standing in the doorway \r\n  and then saw the victim fall to the floor.\r\n\r\nKetura testified that when Crosby attempted to \r\n  break up the fight outside the apartment, the victim told Crosby not to touch \r\n  the girls and the two men shoved each other. While the two men were near the \r\n  doorway, Crosby directed Ketura into the apartment, and she then heard the gunshot.\r\n\r\nCrosby testified that while attempting to break \r\n  up the fight, the victim told him to take his hands off Jenelle. The two exchanged \r\n  words and shoved each other. Crosby stated that as he turned to push Ketura \r\n  into the apartment out of harm's way, he glanced back to see the victim coming \r\n  toward him. The victim was reaching behind his back, and Crosby \r\n  believed the victim had a weapon. Crosby pulled a gun out of his pocket as he \r\n  turned around and shot the gun, though he did not realize right away that the \r\n  gun had discharged.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER \r\n  CHARGE\r\n\r\nCrosby first argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to charge the jury on the law of involuntary manslaughter because the evidence \r\n  showed he acted in self-defense and the shooting \"appeared more accidental than \r\n  intentional.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the defense's case, Crosby \r\n  withdrew his request for a charge on the law of accident, admitting no testimony \r\n  was presented to show an accidental shooting. Because Crosby's testimony showed \r\n  he turned around to find the victim \"on top of him,\" Crosby argued the evidence \r\n  demonstrated he acted recklessly and negligently in handling the gun. Crosby \r\n  contended he was entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter based on the \r\n  premise that the negligent handling of a loaded gun warrants a finding of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter. \r\n\r\n\"The law to be charged to the jury is determined \r\n  from the evidence presented at trial.\" State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, \r\n  433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993) (citation omitted). If there is any evidence to support \r\n  a jury charge, the trial judge should grant the request. State v. Shuler, \r\n  344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001). The trial court commits reversible error \r\n  if it fails to give a requested jury charge on an issue raised by the evidence. \r\n  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999). The trial court's \r\n  refusal to give a requested jury instruction must be \"both erroneous and prejudicial\" \r\n  to warrant reversal. State v. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 173, 539 S.E.2d \r\n  71, 75 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. denied (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nTo be entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter, \r\n  there must be evidence that the defendant either: \r\n\r\n\r\n  killed another without malice and unintentionally, \r\n    but while \"engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting to \r\n    a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm\"; or \r\n    \r\n\r\n  killed another without malice and unintentionally, \r\n    but while \"acting lawfully with reckless disregard of the safety of others.\" \r\n    \r\n\r\nBurriss, 334 S.C. at 264-65, 513 S.E.2d at 109 \r\n  (citation omitted). Involuntary manslaughter is at its heart an unintentional \r\n  act. See Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, 74, 504 S.E.2d 307, 310-11 \r\n  (1998) (\"[W]here a defendant intentionally arms himself and shoots into a crowd \r\n  â€¦ he is not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge.\") (citations and \r\n  footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court has considered whether a killing \r\n  was intentional or accidental in determining whether the facts of a case supported \r\n  a charge of involuntary manslaughter. In Burriss, the defendant was threatened \r\n  and then attacked by the victim and another male. During the fight, the defendant \r\n  drew a gun and fired two rounds into the ground. One attacker backed away, yet \r\n  continued to verbally threaten the defendant and urged his accomplice -- the \r\n  victim -- to attack the defendant again. At this point, the defendant was on \r\n  the ground, separated from his gun. As the victim drew closer, the defendant \r\n  reached for the gun. As he picked it up, the weapon discharged, accidently killing \r\n  the victim: \"When [the victim] began moving threateningly toward [the defendant], \r\n  he snatched his gun up and it fired. [The defendant] stated he was scared and \r\n  his hand was shaking when the gun went off: 'It was an accident. I didn't try \r\n  to shoot nobody.'\" Burriss, 334 S.C. at 263, 513 S.E.2d at 108 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nThe defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, \r\n  the defendant argued the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury \r\n  on the law of accident or involuntary manslaughter. The Supreme Court agreed, \r\n  finding: (1) the factual scenario of the case supported the defendant's argument \r\n  that the shooting was accidental; and (2) the evidence would sustain a finding \r\n  the defendant was lawfully armed in self-defense at the time the fatal shot \r\n  occurred and the negligent handling of a loaded gun supported a finding of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter. Id.  at 263-65, 513 S.E.2d at 108-09. Accordingly, the \r\n  Burriss Court reversed the conviction and remanded the case to the Circuit Court \r\n  with instructions to charge the jury with the law of accident and involuntary \r\n  manslaughter. Id.  at 266, 513 S.E.2d at 110.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the defendant in State v. Pickens, \r\n  320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996), admitted he and a co-defendant intentionally \r\n  shot into an advancing crowd, killing two victims. On appeal, the defendant \r\n  averred the trial judge erred in refusing to charge involuntary manslaughter. \r\n  The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the defendant was not entitled to a charge \r\n  of involuntary manslaughter because he had intentionally fired the gun. Pickens, \r\n  320 S.C. at 531-32, 466 S.E.2d at 366.\r\n\r\nCrosby argues that testimony by Calvin Hill during \r\n  cross-examination granted him the right to a charge of involuntary manslaughter:\r\n\r\nThe Solicitor: [Defense counsel] asked you and \r\n  referred you specifically and asked you if you had mentioned in your statement \r\n  [to the police] whether Mr. Crosby told you, \"I didn't mean to.\" Do you remember \r\n  that?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hill: Yes.\r\n\r\n  The Solicitor: When did he tell you that?\r\n\r\n  Hill: When we got in the car.\r\n\r\n  The Solicitor: And that was after the shooting?\r\n\r\n  Hill: Yes.\r\n\r\n  The Solicitor: And did he tell you that it slipped?\r\n\r\n  Hill: Yes.\r\n\r\n  The Solicitor: He said the gun slipped?\r\n\r\n  Hill: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his testimony, Crosby related the sequence \r\n  of events during his fight with the victim:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Crosby: When I seen him -- when I glanced back, \r\n    I seen his hands behind his back. So I ain't know what kind it was. That's \r\n    when I reached in my pocket and turned around. By the time I turned around, \r\n    he was already up on me. And I just pow.&quot;\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  Crosby: Going through the door. All right. As he's \r\n    coming behind me, you know what I'm saying, he had his hand on me like this.\r\n\r\n  Defense Counsel: Okay. Speak loud.\r\n\r\n  Crosby: Well, he was already -- well, as he was \r\n    charging me, he done took his hand -- by his hand being like that, it frightened \r\n    me. I ain't never seen what's happening in his left hand.\r\n\r\n  Defense Counsel: Did you see anything in his hand?\r\n\r\n  Crosby: No, sir. Not at the moment. I couldn't \r\n    see his hands. \r\n\r\n  Defense Counsel: All right then. What happened?\r\n\r\n  Crosby: That's when I turned around. And that's \r\n    when his arm slowly from behind his back. And as I turned around, before I \r\n    could turn around, I've done hit that pocket.\r\n\r\n  Defense Counsel: You pulled out the pistol.\r\n\r\n  Crosby: He came up, turned around, and boom. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a careful review of the record, we find no \r\n  evidence was presented at trial that would support a charge of involuntary manslaughter. \r\n  Crosby consistently stated he deliberately retrieved the gun from his pocket \r\n  and pulled the trigger. Crosby testified: \"I went in my pocket and pulled that \r\n  gun out. I closed my eyes and pulled the trigger.\" Shooting at a person is an \r\n  unlawful activity that would normally result in great bodily harm or death. \r\n  Because Crosby's actions were intentional, unlawful, and would normally cause \r\n  great bodily harm or death, his actions did not meet the definition of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter. \r\n\r\nCrosby further argues that the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to charge the law of involuntary manslaughter because the facts of \r\n  his case are similar to the facts in Burriss. However, the facts are in actuality \r\n  more similar to the circumstances in Pickens. Crosby admitted he intentionally \r\n  shot the gun. Furthermore, no evidence was presented that the gun accidentally \r\n  discharged. Crosby also waived the defense of accident at trial. Although it \r\n  appears that Crosby may not have intended the shooting to result in the victim's \r\n  death, no evidence was presented at trial to support Crosby's claim that the \r\n  shooting was not intentional. The situation presented in the instant case is \r\n  analogous to the factual circumstances reviewed by the Surpeme Court in State \r\n  v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d 306 (1976), Bozeman v. State, \r\n  307 S.C. 172, 414 S.E.2d 144 (1991), and State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, \r\n  446 S.E.2d 411 (1994). In each of these cases, the Court ruled the defendant \r\n  was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Craig, the defendant admitted \r\n  that he intentionally fired his shotgun at the victim, but claimed he only meant \r\n  to shoot over the victim's head. The Supreme Court found no error with the trial \r\n  judge's refusal to charge the law of involuntary manslaughter. Id. at \r\n  269, 227 S.E.2d at 310.\r\n\r\nRelying upon Craig, the Supreme Court in \r\n  Bozeman v. State refused to find fault with defense counsel's failure \r\n  to request a charge of involuntary manslaughter:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d \r\n    306 (1976), this Court found no error in the refusal to charge the law of \r\n    involuntary manslaughter when the defendant admitted intentionally firing \r\n    the gun, but claimed he only meant to shoot over the victim's head. Here, \r\n    petitioner testified at trial, \"I pulled the pistol up and I shot.\" Petitioner \r\n    stated that he never aimed the pistol. He did, however, intend to shoot the \r\n    gun. There is no evidence to support an allegation of mere criminal negligence \r\n    in the use of a dangerous instrumentality. Because the evidence in the record \r\n    does not support a charge of involuntary manslaughter, trial counsel's failure \r\n    to request a jury charge of involuntary manslaughter was not deficient performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 177, 414 S.E.2d at 147.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Smith, the defendant was convicted \r\n  of stabbing the victim following an argument over a $2.00 debt the victim owed \r\n  the defendant. On appeal, the defendant asserted the trial court erroneously \r\n  denied his request for an involuntary manslaughter jury charge. Following the \r\n  precedent recited in Craig and Bozeman, the Supreme Court affirmed \r\n  the trial judge's decision:\r\n\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter was recently reviewed \r\n  in Bozeman v. State, 307 S.C. 172, 414 S.E.2d 144 (1992) (citing State \r\n  v. Barnett, 218 S.C. 415, 63 S.E.2d 57 (1951)), where we stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n[f]irst, involuntary manslaughter may be described as the killing of another without malice and\r\nunintentionally, but while one is engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting\r\nto a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or bodily harm.   The second situation may be\r\ndescribed as the killing of another without malice and unintentionally but while engaged in the\r\ndoing of a lawful act with a reckless disregard of the safety of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nId., 307 S.C. at 176, 414 S.E.2d at 146-147.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Our analysis in Bozeman relied heavily \r\n    on our earlier decision in State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d \r\n    306 (1976). In Craig, we found no error in failing to charge involuntary \r\n    manslaughter where a defendant intentionally fired a gun, but claimed that \r\n    he was only firing above the victim's head. In Bozeman, on facts similar \r\n    to Craig, we stated that there was \"no evidence to support an allegation \r\n    of mere criminal negligence in the use of a dangerous instrumentality.\"\r\n\r\n  The record here demonstrates that Smith acted \r\n    intentionally in wielding the knife. When Evans grabbed Smith, Smith pulled \r\n    the knife, a dangerous instrumentality, and stabbed at Evans. Just as in Craig, \r\n    whether Smith intended to harm Evans is irrelevant. The stabbing is clearly \r\n    not a lawful act, and the intentional use of a dangerous instrumentality does \r\n    not support the allegation of mere criminal negligence. Because Smith's actions \r\n    were outside the definition of involuntary manslaughter as we restated recently \r\n    in Bozeman, the trial court did not commit error in refusing to instruct the \r\n    jury on the law of involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nId.  at 550, 446 S.E.2d at 413.\r\n\r\nWe conclude no evidence was presented in the case \r\n  sub judice that would support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. MISTRIAL  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCrosby next argues the trial court erred by failing \r\n  to grant his motion for a mistrial after the solicitor's closing argument. We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In closing, the solicitor made the following statement:\r\n\r\n  There was no self-defense. You have got the power, \r\n    you 12 have got the power to come back with a verdict that says self-defense. \r\n    Based on the evidence of this case and the reasonable inferences, I submit \r\n    to you that would be paramount (sic) [tantamount] to giving Leon Crosby a \r\n    license to kill.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrosby immediately objected to the State's argument \r\n  as appealing to the passion and prejudice of the jury. Before allowing the State's \r\n  closing argument to continue, the trial judge suggested the solicitor \"tone \r\n  it down a bit.\" \r\n\r\nAfter the State finished its closing argument, \r\n  Crosby reiterated his argument regarding the \"license to kill\" statement and \r\n  moved for a mistrial. Although the trial court found the \"license to kill\" statement \r\n  was \"marginally inappropriate,\" the court determined that a curative instruction \r\n  would correct the problem, and it denied Crosby's motion for mistrial. The trial \r\n  court later instructed the members of the jury that they were not to be motivated \r\n  by sympathy, passion, or prejudice. Crosby did not complain about the curative \r\n  instruction or move for a mistrial after the trial court instructed the jury.\r\n\r\nCrosby now argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to grant the motion for mistrial because the State's \"license to kill\" argument \r\n  prejudiced him. \r\n\r\nInitially, we note this issue is probably not preserved \r\n  for review. Although Crosby complained about the State's closing argument, he \r\n  did not object to the curative instruction given by the trial judge, nor did \r\n  he move for a mistrial at the end of the jury instructions. Where a curative \r\n  instruction is given and the objecting party does not contemporaneously challenge \r\n  the sufficiency of the corrective charge or move for mistrial, no issue is preserved \r\n  for review. See State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996) \r\n  (holding no issue is preserved for appellate review if objecting party accepts \r\n  judge's ruling and does not contemporaneously make additional objection to sufficiency \r\n  of curative charge or move for mistrial).\r\n\r\nIn any event, the decision to grant or deny a mistrial \r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Dawkins, \r\n  297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989). \"The granting of a motion for a mistrial \r\n  is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous \r\n  that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.\" State v. Beckham, 334 \r\n  S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nWhen considering the propriety of a solicitor's \r\n  closing argument, the trial court is vested with broad discretion, including \r\n  the discretion to grant or deny the defendant's mistrial motion. State v. \r\n  Durden, 264 S.C. 86, 212 S.E.2d 587 (1975); see also State v. McCray, \r\n  332 S.C. 536, 506 S.E.2d 301 (1998) (demonstrating appellate review of a trial \r\n  judge's denial of defendant's mistrial motion is governed by abuse of discretion \r\n  standard); State v. Brown, 333 S.C. 185, 191, 508 S.E.2d 38, 41 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998) (\"The propriety of closing argument is vested in the broad discretion \r\n  of the trial judge.\") (citation omitted). The State's closing arguments must \r\n  be confined to evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences that may \r\n  be drawn from the evidence. State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d \r\n  620 (1996). Furthermore, the solicitor's closing argument must not appeal to \r\n  the personal biases of the jurors. Id.  However, to be entitled to a \r\n  new trial for improper closing arguments, the test is whether \"the Solicitor's \r\n  comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction \r\n  a denial of due process.\" State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 362, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  586, 596 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nThe solicitor's argument in the present case was \r\n  merely a comment on the lack of evidence of self-defense and clearly did not \r\n  appeal to the passions or prejudice of the jury. The solicitor stayed within \r\n  the evidence presented at trial and the reasonable inferences therefrom. Although \r\n  the trial court found the argument \"marginally inappropriate,\" it was an isolated \r\n  incident. Reviewing the entire record, we do not find that the single comment \r\n  regarding a \"license to kill\" so infected the trial with unfairness as to make \r\n  the conviction a denial of due process. Further, the trial judge's curative \r\n  instruction directed the jurors that their verdict was not to be motivated by \r\n  passion or prejudice. Accordingly, we find the trial court's curative instruction \r\n  cured any error in the solicitor's argument, and the trial court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in denying Crosby's mistrial motion. \r\n\r\nIII. PHOTOGRAPH\r\n\r\nCrosby argues the photograph of the victim's body \r\n  was unduly prejudicial and the trial court erred in allowing its admission. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe State sought to admit several photographs of \r\n  the victim's body at trial. A photograph marked Exhibit 8 was taken outside \r\n  the apartment. Exhibit 8 predominantly showed the victim's feet lying outside \r\n  the door and a small amount of blood. Crosby did not object to the admission \r\n  of Exhibit 8. The State later sought to admit a photograph marked Exhibit 9. \r\n  Exhibit 9 was taken from a different angle to show the entire length of the \r\n  victim's body, and it also showed some blood. The State argued the position \r\n  of the body was relevant to its theory that the victim was shot from behind \r\n  and Exhibit 9 displayed the positioning of the body more accurately than the \r\n  other photographs. Although Crosby argued Exhibit 9 was unduly prejudicial, \r\n  the trial court determined the photograph had probative value and was not unduly \r\n  prejudicial, especially in light of the fact that Exhibit 8 already displayed \r\n  some blood.\r\n\r\nThe State admitted Exhibit 9 into evidence during \r\n  a responding police officer's testimony regarding the location and position \r\n  of the victim's body. Dr. Joel Sexton, a forensic pathologist, later testified \r\n  that the victim died from the gunshot wound to the neck that severed the carotid \r\n  artery and transected the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n\"The relevance, materiality and admissibility of \r\n  photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a \r\n  ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.\" State \r\n  v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1999). If the photographs \r\n  serve to corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit them. \r\n  State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996); State v. Middleton, \r\n  288 S.C. 21, 339 S.E.2d 692 (1986). However, photographs calculated to \"arouse \r\n  the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are irrelevant \r\n  or not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.\" State v. \r\n  Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, Exhibit 9 corroborated the \r\n  testimony of the responding officer regarding the position of the victim's body. \r\n  The photograph also corroborated the testimony of Dr. Sexton regarding the injuries \r\n  suffered by the victim. Although the photograph showed some blood, we do not \r\n  believe the photograph was offensive or calculated to arouse sympathy or prejudice. \r\n  Further, Crosby did not object to the admission of Exhibit 8, which also showed \r\n  the victim's body and blood. Because Exhibit 9 was relevant to corroborate the \r\n  testimony of witnesses and did not appeal to the jury's passions or prejudice, \r\n  we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Exhibit 9 \r\n  into evidence. \r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial court's rulings \r\n  are \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3431","title":"State v.

Rice appeals his convictions for trafficking in crack cocaine and conspiracy \r\n  to traffic in crack cocaine, arguing his prosecution was barred by S.C. Code \r\n  Annotated section 44-53-410 (1985). We affirm.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nA federal grand jury indicted Rice on charges that \r\n  he possessed crack cocaine with the intent to distribute and that he conspired \r\n  with others to do the same. After a district court dismissed the charges with \r\n  prejudice for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, the State Grand Jury indicted \r\n  him on these charges which evolve from the same facts as the federal indictments. \r\n  (1) A jury convicted Rice as charged and he was sentenced to two concurrent \r\n  twenty-five year terms. \r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nRice argues that under section 44-53-410, the dismissal \r\n  of his federal charges barred his prosecution in state court. Although he did \r\n  not raise this issue in the trial court he asserts we may address it because \r\n  it involves subject matter jurisdiction. See Brown v. State, 343 \r\n  S.C. 342, 346, 540 S.E.2d 846, 848-49 (2001) (issues related to subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including for the first time on appeal). \r\n  We conclude the statute in question does not involve subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  and thus Rice's issue is not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-410 is entitled \"Prosecution in another \r\n  jurisdiction shall be bar to prosecution\" and provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a violation of this article is a violation of \r\n  a Federal law or the law of another state, the conviction or acquittal under \r\n  Federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to prosecution \r\n  in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 (1985). \r\n\r\nThis court has previously jointly analyzed claims \r\n  based on this statute and double jeopardy, finding the issues \"closely intertwined.\" \r\n  State&nbsp;v. Harris, 342 S.C. 191, 198, 535 S.E.2d 652, 655 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000). However, the precise issue Rice now raises was not addressed in Harris. \r\n  A claim of double jeopardy is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  and thus may not be raised for the first time on appeal. See Medlock v. One \r\n  1985 Jeep Cherokee VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 S.E.2d \r\n  373, 376 (1996) (double jeopardy claim may not be raised for the first time \r\n  on appeal). Therefore we must decide whether an alleged violation of section \r\n  44-53-410 involves subject matter jurisdiction even though a double jeopardy \r\n  claim does not.\r\n\r\nEssentially, section 44-53-410 extends protection \r\n  against double jeopardy beyond the minimum constitutional requirements by barring \r\n  the prosecution of a person under the narcotics and controlled substances statutes \r\n  of this state when the person has been convicted or acquitted in federal court \r\n  or the courts of another state of a violation based on the same conduct. \r\n  (2) Section 44-53-410 provides that a person's conviction or acquittal \r\n  under federal law or the law of another state \"is a bar to prosecution \r\n  in this State.\" Â§ 44-53-410 (emphasis added). The statute's plain language indicates \r\n  the legislature's intent to simply limit the State's right to prosecute in such \r\n  circumstances. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Estate of Hancock, 345 S.C. 81, 86, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 845, 847 (Ct. App. 2001) (legislative intent is primarily determined \r\n  by reference to the plain language of the statute). The legislature could have \r\n  expressly circumscribed the jurisdiction of trial courts in such cases, but \r\n  it did not do so. We therefore conclude section 44-53-410 is a limitation on \r\n  the prosecutorial rights of the executive branch and not on the authority of \r\n  the judicial branch. Because Rice raises this argument for the first time on \r\n  appeal, and because it does not involve a question of subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  it is not preserved for our review. State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, \r\n  476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (issues not raised to the trial court are not preserved \r\n  for appellate review). Accordingly, Rice's convictions for trafficking in crack \r\n  cocaine and conspiracy to traffic in crack cocaine are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Earlier state charges stemming \r\n  from the same alleged conduct were nolle prossed at the onset of the federal \r\n  prosecution.  \r\n2.  Under the dual sovereignty \r\n  doctrine, successive prosecution of the same conduct by separate sovereigns \r\n  is not a violation of the federal constitutional prohibition against double \r\n  jeopardy.

Means \r\n  appeals, alleging the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of his expert \r\n  witness, a neuropsychologist, which was offered to rebut Gates' implication \r\n  that Means' physical symptoms were not genuine. Means contends the exclusion \r\n  of this evidence prejudiced his case and resulted in a lower jury verdict. We \r\n  reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis appeal arises out of a three-car chain collision \r\n  that occurred on August 29, 1996, when Gates ran into the back of another vehicle, \r\n  which in turn struck Means' vehicle from behind. After the accident, Means was \r\n  treated for lower back and shoulder pain, as well as numbness in his arms and \r\n  legs. \r\n\r\nMeans filed this negligence action against Gates, \r\n  alleging he suffered physical injury, mental distress, lost wages, and substantial \r\n  expenditures for past and future medical treatment. In his amended answer, Gates \r\n  admitted simple negligence in causing the accident, but asserted \"Absence of \r\n  Injuries\" as a defense.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Means testified that he experienced chronic \r\n  lower back pain as a result of the accident, which interfered with his daily \r\n  activities and caused him distress. Means stated he had incurred medical expenses \r\n  of $28,951.34 and lost wages of $1,791.77 to date.\r\n\r\nDr. Gregory Jones, Means' primary treating physician, \r\n  diagnosed Means with an annular (outer layer) tear and herniated discs in the \r\n  thoracic, lumbar, and sacrum regions of his spine, along with nerve root compromise. \r\n  Dr. Jones stated Means probably would require nerve blocks indefinitely to control \r\n  his pain, a maximum of four a year, at a cost of more than $1,000 per procedure. \r\n  Dr. Jones stated -- to a reasonable degree of medical certainty -- that the \r\n  symptoms generated from Means' disc herniation were a direct result of the August \r\n  1996 automobile accident. Dr. Jones assigned Means a 10 percent impairment rating \r\n  to the lower back and legs. \r\n\r\nThe defense asserted Means' physical problems predated \r\n  the August 1996 collision and that the impact was not significant enough to \r\n  cause the injuries described by Means' treating physician. Gates hired Dr. Robert \r\n  Sopka to perform an analysis of the forces involved in the impact. Dr. Sopka \r\n  is a physics professor and department chair at the Community College of Baltimore \r\n  County in Catonsville, Maryland with experience in analyzing the physics of \r\n  motor vehicle collisions. Dr. Sopka testified he additionally worked for Forensic \r\n  Technologies, a litigation-services group, as a senior physicist, but was not \r\n  a certified accident reconstructionist.\r\n\r\nIn a videotaped deposition, Dr. Sopka testified \r\n  in detail about what he considered the fairly insignificant forces of impact \r\n  of the \"low-speed\" accident. Dr. Sopka stated he had reviewed the police report \r\n  and analyzed the weights of the vehicles and the passengers; further, he had \r\n  considered the characteristics of the particular makes of vehicles involved \r\n  in the accident and how they respond to impact, i.e., \"how crushable a vehicle \r\n  is.\" Dr. Sopka concluded \"that the speed change of Mr. Means' Dodge Ram Charger \r\n  [from the three-car collision] could have been no more than 5.2 miles per hour \r\n  in a forward direction\" and \"that the G forces experienced during this collision \r\n  were no more than 2.4 Gs, again, in the forward direction.\" Dr. Sopka described \r\n  one G as the normal acceleration of a falling object caused by gravity. Dr. \r\n  Sopka observed, \"If there's less impact, then there's less crush, and that's \r\n  the sort of thing we need to evaluate.\"\r\n\r\nGates also retained a radiologist, Dr. Barry F. \r\n  Jeffries, to testify regarding what, if any, injuries were caused by the automobile \r\n  accident. Dr. Jeffries specializes in neuroradiology and is licensed in Georgia \r\n  and Missouri. Dr. Jeffries explained \"[n]euroradiology is that branch of diagnostic \r\n  radiology that is concerned with the brain, the spinal cord, and the bony covering, \r\n  such as the skull and the spine. It also includes â€¦ [t]he structures of the \r\n  face and the neck.\" Dr. Jeffries reviewed Means' X-rays and MRI scans and opined \r\n  that Means' annular tear, disc herniation, and nerve root impingement were the \r\n  result of a natural degenerative process and not caused by the August 1996 collision.\r\n\r\nTo rebut this testimony, Means attempted to introduce \r\n  the videotaped deposition testimony of a neuropsychologist, Dr. Randolph Waid, \r\n  who stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty in the field of clinical \r\n  psychology that Means suffered from \"chronic pain syndrome\" that negatively \r\n  impacted his ability to pursue social, recreational, and vocational activities. \r\n  He further opined the chronic pain was probably caused by the August 1996 automobile \r\n  accident. Dr. Waid concluded Means' physical symptoms appeared genuine and not \r\n  the result of any psychological disturbance. The trial court ruled the deposition \r\n  was inadmissible. The jury thereafter returned a verdict for Means of $25,000. \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Means contends the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to admit any portion of the videotaped deposition of the neuropsychologist \r\n  who performed a series of psychological tests on him after the accident. Means \r\n  contends the testimony was necessary to rebut Gates' implication that his injuries \r\n  were not as severe as he had alleged and were the result of malingering. He \r\n  contends the exclusion of the testimony was prejudicial and resulted in a jury \r\n  verdict that was less in dollar amount than the sum of his medical bills. We \r\n  agree with Means that the exclusion of Dr. Waid's testimony constituted an abuse \r\n  of discretion and therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\"If scientific, technical, or other specialized \r\n  knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine \r\n  a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, \r\n  training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\" \r\n  Rule 702, SCRE.\r\n\r\nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony \r\n  is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, whose decision will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Payton v. Kearse, \r\n  329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998); Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. \r\n  342, 426 S.E.2d 785 (1993); Gazes v.

App. 2000), cert. filed.\r\n\r\nA court's ruling on the admissibility of a neuropsychologist's \r\n  testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion where the ruling is manifestly \r\n  arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair. Huntoon v. TCI Cablevision of Colo., \r\n  Inc., 969 P.2d 681 (Colo. 1998) (en banc). \"Before the Court of Appeals \r\n  will reverse a judgment for an alleged error in the exclusion of evidence, the \r\n  appellant must show prejudice.\" Potomac Leasing Co. v. Bone, 294 S.C. \r\n  494, 497, 366 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\nDr. Waid has a bachelor's degree in general psychology \r\n  from Temple University, a master's degree in psychology from the University \r\n  of Richmond, and a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of North \r\n  Texas following an internship at the Medical University of South Carolina in \r\n  Charleston (&quot;MUSC&quot;). \r\n\r\nDr. Waid worked as the director of psychological \r\n  services at a private psychiatric facility in Dallas, Texas before returning \r\n  to Charleston in 1982 to join MUSC's faculty in the departments of psychiatry \r\n  and neurology. In 1989, he became the director of MUSC's assessment center, \r\n  where he ran a clinic providing assessments for conditions such as chronic pain, \r\n  neurological disorders, and psychiatric disorders. In 1998, Dr. Waid became \r\n  a clinical associate professor in psychiatry and neurology at MUSC and opened \r\n  a private practice in Mount Pleasant. Dr. Waid is not a medical doctor and is \r\n  not licensed to prescribe medications. \r\n\r\nIn his videotaped deposition, Dr. Waid testified \r\n  Means was referred to him in April 1997 for evaluation of continuing pain and \r\n  lower back problems after extensive medication, physical therapy, and diagnostic \r\n  procedures had failed to provide relief. Means was referred to the doctor \"to \r\n  assess for any associated psychological problems along with his chronic pain \r\n  syndrome and to make recommendations with regard to Mr. Means' rehabilitation \r\n  needs.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of the evaluative process, Dr. Waid gave \r\n  Means \"a battery of psychological tests, primarily to measure for psychiatric \r\n  difficulties, specifically to measure for depression and anxiety, as well as \r\n  to measure his complaints related to pain and how they are affecting his life.\" \r\n  Dr. Waid testified he \"performed â€¦ a very extensive broad based psychological \r\n  test â€¦ [called] the Personality Assessment Inventory. It's made up of numerous \r\n  scales measuring areas of clinical symptomatology. The individual generally \r\n  has to respond to this rather extensive test in terms of whether the statement \r\n  is false, slightly true, mainly true, or very true.\" This test is used to tell \r\n  \"where a person is functioning in different areas of symptomatology.&quot;\r\n\r\nDr. Waid stated the test revealed Means \"really \r\n  had no significant elevations that would be suggestive of a psychiatric disturbance.\" \r\n  Means did have \"moderate elevations consistent with his complaints â€¦ about physical \r\n  functioning; health; and persistent pain â€¦.\" The test results also indicated \r\n  there \"was some mild or transient depression and anxiety\" associated with this \r\n  condition.\r\n\r\nDr. Waid concluded, \"In my opinion[,] Mr. Means \r\n  was suffering from a chronic pain syndrome that had resulted in a negative impact \r\n  in his ability to pursue â€¦ social, recreational, [and] vocational activities.\" \r\n  He stated to a reasonable degree of professional certainty in the field of clinical \r\n  psychology that the automobile accident of August 29, 1996, probably caused \r\n  Means' chronic pain syndrome and related difficulties. He further averred he \r\n  found no reason to believe Means' complaints of pain were not genuine.\r\n\r\nDr. Waid opined Means was \"a very good candidate\" \r\n  for using techniques for chronic pain management, including psychological strategies, \r\n  education, a review of potential medications, electrostimulation, acupuncture, \r\n  and other methods to assist Means in coping and living with pain more effectively \r\n  based on Means' \"willingness not to overuse medication, his desire to cope and \r\n  [to] continue â€¦ as best he could â€¦.\" Dr. Waid thought Means would benefit from \r\n  an outpatient chronic pain rehabilitation program directed by William Key at \r\n  MUSC, with an estimated cost of around $6,000.\r\n\r\nThe trial court reviewed the entire videotaped \r\n  deposition and ruled it was inadmissible. The court acknowledged Dr. Waid had \r\n  conducted tests and there was \"nothing to suggest the tests were not conducted \r\n  in accordance with [the] acceptable standard[s] of his practice and profession \r\n  nor that the results were not useful or beneficial.\" However, the court felt \r\n  Dr. Waid had not formed a diagnosis, and because he had referred Means to another \r\n  psychologist, Dr. Key, there was the indication that Dr. Waid \"really wasn't \r\n  treating at all.\" The court noted \"[t]he essence of [Dr. Waid's] testimony is \r\n  that he believed the plaintiff and believed that he certainly was suffering \r\n  from pain. And there's no question that this pain caused him great anxiety and \r\n  he talked about the reasons, the psychological reasons for that .â€¦ Other than \r\n  that, his testimony dealt with a -- really a variety of questions, [including] \r\n  malingering â€¦. Just a litany of â€¦ matters of really no useful benefit in this \r\n  case.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court stated although Dr. Waid's opinion \r\n  that Means was not a malingerer would probably be admissible, he had heard nothing \r\n  to suggest by way of cross-examination or otherwise that Means was a malingerer. \r\n  The trial judge concluded the testimony was not admissible because Dr. Waid \r\n  was not really rendering any treatment to Means and the court was unsure of \r\n  the purpose for the testimony.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Means was offering the expert testimony \r\n  of neuropsychologist Dr. Waid to show: a battery of tests had revealed no psychiatric \r\n  reason for his physical ailments; Means was suffering from chronic pain syndrome, \r\n  which is a psychological condition, although not a condition of disturbance; \r\n  and this condition was caused by the August 1996 automobile accident involving \r\n  Gates. Means contends this testimony was essential to rebut Gates' experts and \r\n  prejudiced the presentation of his case, as evidenced by the jury's low verdict.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Gates contends the trial court properly \r\n  excluded the evidence because it was not relevant and, even if admissible, was \r\n  more prejudicial than probative. See Rule 401, SCRE (\"'Relevant evidence' \r\n  means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is \r\n  of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable \r\n  than it would be without the evidence.\"); Rule 402, SCRE (\"Evidence which is \r\n  not relevant is not admissible.\"); Rule 403, SCRE (\"Although relevant, evidence \r\n  may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \r\n  of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by \r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative \r\n  evidence.\").\r\n\r\n \"A neuropsychologist is a specialist in the area \r\n  of clinical psychology, a discipline which focuses on the brain and behavioral \r\n  relationships of individuals who have brain impairment due to dementia, head \r\n  injury or other kinds of brain disease.\" Cunningham v. Montgomery, 921 \r\n  P.2d 1355, 1357 (Or. Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nIn Howle v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 288 S.C. \r\n  586, 593, 344 S.E.2d 157, 160 (Ct. App. 1986), this Court observed: \"Psychologists \r\n  have been allowed to give expert opinions as to mental and emotional condition, \r\n  and often causation, in many different types \r\n  of cases.\" (citations omitted). We further stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Section 40-47-40, which defines the term \"practice \r\n    of medicine,\" neither expressly nor implicitly bars a psychologist from testifying \r\n    as to diagnosis, prognosis, and causation. A psychologist is not incompetent \r\n    to give his opinion simply because he is not a licensed medical doctor. At \r\n    most, a psychologist's lack of a medical license affects his credibility and \r\n    is a proper subject for cross-examination and for comment during jury argument.\r\n\r\n  Section 40-55-50, which defines the practice \r\n    of psychology, likewise neither expressly nor implicitly bars a psychologist \r\n    from giving testimony as to diagnosis, prognosis, and causation. Indeed, Section \r\n    40-55-60, another statute included among those that regulate the practice \r\n    of psychology, contemplates that a psychologist may \"diagnose, \r\n    prescribe for, treat or advise a client with reference to complaints\" embraced \r\n    by psychological practice \"as determined by the Board [of Examiners \r\n    in Psychology].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 594, 344 S.E.2d at 161 (emphasis added) \r\n  (citations omitted) (alteration in original).\r\n\r\nIn Howle, we held: \"[A] psychologist, once qualified \r\n  as an expert witness by reason of education, training, and experience, is competent \r\n  to testify as to diagnosis, prognosis, and causation of mental and emotional \r\n  disturbance.\" Id. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nWe note the narrow question on appeal is not the \r\n  sufficiency of Dr. Waid's professional qualifications or whether his testimony \r\n  is outside the limits of psychological practice. The trial court expressly acknowledged \r\n  that Dr. Waid's testimony would be admissible to rebut an accusation of malingering \r\n  and, contrary to the court's determination, we conclude this is precisely the \r\n  implication raised by Gates when he pled \"Absence of Injuries\" as a defense \r\n  and presented expert witnesses who asserted: (1) the collision was one of low \r\n  impact; and (2) that there was no medical basis for Means' claim that the automobile \r\n  accident caused his symptoms. \r\n\r\nWe further conclude the determination whether Means \r\n  suffered from a condition of \"chronic pain syndrome\" and whether his symptoms \r\n  had their genesis in a psychological cause were areas within the expertise of \r\n  the neuropsychologist. Any flaws in Dr. Waid's analysis would go to the weight \r\n  and credibility of his testimony, not its admissibility, and this expert testimony \r\n  would supply specialized knowledge that would aid the jury in determining a \r\n  fact in issue. See Rule 702, SCRE (providing a qualified expert may testify \r\n  when \"scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge will assist the trier \r\n  of fact â€¦ to determine a fact in issue\"); Huntoon v. TCI Cablevision of Colo., \r\n  Inc., 969 P.2d 681 (Colo. 1998) (en banc) (holding the trial court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion by admitting neuropsychologist testimony, which \r\n  explained the use of a battery of tests to determine the impact of an injurious \r\n  event on an individual's ability to carry out everyday activities and identified \r\n  the causation of the plaintiff's organic brain injury); Sanchez v. Derby, \r\n  433 N.W.2d 523 (Neb. 1989) (finding the trial court abused its discretion in \r\n  excluding the testimony of a neuropsychologist that a motorist's behavioral \r\n  changes were caused by either a combination of post-traumatic stress disorder \r\n  and chronic pain syndrome or an organic affective disorder secondary to a mild \r\n  brain injury -- the appellate court stating the dispositive issue was whether \r\n  the testimony would supply specialized knowledge that would assist the jury \r\n  in determining a fact in issue).\r\n\r\nFinally, we find exclusion of the evidence was \r\n  not harmless error as there was no equivalent testimony presented to this effect. \r\n  Cf. Bernard v. Lott, 666 So.2d 702 (La. Ct. App. 1995) (holding the exclusion \r\n  of a neuropsychologist's opinion regarding whether the plaintiff suffered a \r\n  brain injury on the basis she was not a medical doctor was harmless error because \r\n  additional medical experts testified about how the results of the neuropsychologist's \r\n  testing supported a finding of a brain injury). Accordingly, we hold the trial \r\n  court erred in excluding the videotaped deposition of Dr. Waid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude the exclusion \r\n  of the neuropsychologist's testimony was reversible error warranting a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED and the case is REMANDED for trial.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3428","title":"Harris-Jenkins v.

Pursuant to this agreement, Nissan Car Mart was required to \r\n  pay $20,000 to the Jenkinses in exchange for their termination of legal action \r\n  against the dealer. Nissan Car Mart failed to pay the settlement amount despite \r\n  being ordered by the Circuit Court to do so.

Nissan Car Mart appeals the \r\n  portion of the order awarding the $1,500 to the Jenkinses for attorney's fees. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Jenkinses filed a complaint alleging fraud \r\n  and unfair trade practices against Nissan Car Mart. Nissan Car Mart offered \r\n  $20,000 to settle the case. The Jenkinses, through their attorney, accepted \r\n  Nissan Car Mart's offer. Following the Jenkinses' acceptance, Nissan Car Mart \r\n  wrote to the Jenkinses' attorney, proposing to pay the $20,000 in monthly payments, \r\n  rather than a lump sum. According to Nissan Car Mart's attorney, these terms \r\n  were necessary because the dealer did not \"have the cas[h] in lump sum.\" \r\n  The Jenkinses refused the payment terms. Nissan Car Mart did not pay \r\n  any of the settlement amount. Consequently, the Jenkinses moved for an order \r\n  to compel execution of the settlement agreement and requested sanctions against \r\n  Nissan Car Mart.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court ordered Nissan Car Mart pay -- \r\n  within 30 days of the order -- $20,000 plus 8 3/4% interest from the date of \r\n  the Jenkinses' acceptance of the settlement. The Circuit Court denied the Jenkinses \r\n  request for sanctions. Nissan Car Mart did not pay the ordered amount within \r\n  the 30 day period. The Jenkinses moved for sanctions, seeking the incarceration \r\n  of Bill Leadingham, president of Nissan Car Mart, until Nissan Car Mart paid \r\n  the $20,000 plus the accrued interest and costs, including attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court held a Rule to Show Cause hearing. \r\n  Following the hearing, the court issued an order mandating Nissan Car Mart pay \r\n  the $20,000 settlement amount. The court additionally ordered Nissan Cart Mart \r\n  pay the Jenkinses $2,673 in accrued interest and $1,500 in attorney's fees. \r\n  The court denied Nissan Car Mart's motion for reconsideration. Nissan Car Mart \r\n  appeals the circuit judge's award of attorney's fees to the Jenkinses.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whether the Circuit Court erred in assessing attorney's \r\n    fees against Nissan Car Mart due to its failure to satisfy its settlement \r\n    agreement with the Jenkinses?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.

Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d \r\n  915 (1982), the Supreme Court discussed the law relating to the contempt power \r\n  of our courts, specifically compensatory contempt:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The power to punish for contempt is inherent \r\n    in all courts. Its existence is essential to the preservation of order in \r\n    judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders and \r\n    writs of the courts, and consequently to the due administration of justice. \r\n    McLeod v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, 251 S.E.2d 746 (1979); State v. Goff, \r\n    228 S.C. 17, 88 S.E.2d 788 (1955) â€¦. Contempt results from the \r\n    willful disobedience of an order of the court, and before a person may be \r\n    held in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to the acts or \r\n    conduct upon which such finding is based. Edwards v. Edwards, \r\n    254 S.C. 466, 176 S.E.2d 123 (1970); Bigham v. Bigham, 264 S.C. 101, \r\n    212 S.E.2d 594 (1975).\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  Compensatory contempt is a money award for the \r\n    plaintiff when the defendant has injured the plaintiff by violating a previous \r\n    court order. The goal is to indemnify the plaintiff directly for harm the \r\n    contemnor caused by breaching the injunction.  Rendleman, Compensatory \r\n    Contempt: Plaintiff's Remedy When A Defendant Violates An Injunction, \r\n    1980 Ill.L.F. 971. Courts utilize compensatory contempt to restore the plaintiff \r\n    as nearly as possible to his original position. Therefore it is remedial.\r\n\r\n  We have recognized compensatory contempt in at \r\n    least two cases. In Ex Parte Thurmond, 1 Bailey 605 (1830), we stated \r\n    that when an individual right is directly involved in a contempt proceeding, \r\n    the court has the power to order the contemnor to place the injured party \r\n    in as good a situation as he would have been if the contempt had not been \r\n    committed, or to suffer imprisonment. In Lorick &amp; Lowrance v. Motley, \r\n    69 S.C. 567, 48 S.E. 614 (1904), we held that a contemnor may be required \r\n    to pay damages suffered by reason of his contemptuous action or suffer imprisonmentâ€¦.\r\n\r\nâ€¦.\r\n\r\nCompensatory contempt awards have been affirmed also by the United States Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n  â€¦.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the compensatory award should be limited to the complainant's actual loss.  Included in the actual loss are the costs\r\nin defending and enforcing the court's order, including litigation costs and attorney's fees.  The burden of showing what\r\namount, if anything, the complainant is entitled to recover by way of compensation should be on the complainant.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 382, 386-87, 287 S.E.2d at 917, 919-20 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nII. Statutory Attorney Fees\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the authority to award attorney's \r\n  fees can come only from a statute or be provided for in the language of a contract. \r\n  There is no common law right to recover attorney's fees. Jackson v. Speed, \r\n  326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997); American Fed. Bank, FSB v. Number One \r\n  Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 467 S.E.2d 439 (1996); Blumberg v. \r\n  Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 427 S.E.2d 659 (1993); Baron Data Sys., Inc. \r\n  v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989); Dowaliby v. Chambless, \r\n  344 S.C. 558, 544 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2001); Harvey v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Corrections, 338 S.C. 500, 527 S.E.2d 765 (Ct. App. 2000); Global \r\n  Protection Corp. v. Halbersberg, 332 S.C. 149, 503 S.E.2d 483 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998); Prevatte v. Asbury Arms, 302 S.C. 413, 396 S.E.2d 642 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990).\r\n\r\nThe Jenkinses, in their brief, do not assert any \r\n  statutory authority that authorizes a judge to award attorney's fees as sanctions \r\n  for nonpayment of a settlement agreement because no South Carolina statute exists \r\n  that confers this authority.\r\n\r\nIII. SCRCP/Attorney Fees\r\n\r\nDuring the Rule to Show Cause hearing, the Circuit \r\n  Court alluded that its ability to impose sanctions awarding attorney's fees \r\n  could come from the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (&quot;SCRCP&quot;). \r\n  In examining the SCRCP, there are several rules that allow the award \r\n  of attorney's fees as sanctions or costs. None of these rules, however, apply \r\n  to this particular situation. See Rule 11, SCRCP (allowing an award of \r\n  attorney's fees when the court finds the opposing party has filed pleadings \r\n  that were made in bad faith and/or frivolous); Rules 30 and 37, SCRCP (granting \r\n  award of attorney's fees as sanctions for discovery abuse); Rule 45, SCRCP (allowing \r\n  attorney's fees for placing on undue burden on a person responding to a subpoena; \r\n  Rule 54, SCRCP (allows imposing attorney's fees as costs when authorized by \r\n  statute); (1) Rule 56, SCRCP (permitting for \r\n  sanction awarding attorney's fees when affidavits are made in bad faith).\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, courts interpret statutes that \r\n  grant the power to award attorney's fees narrowly because these laws were enacted \r\n  in derogation of the common law. See Dowaliby v. Chambliss, 344 \r\n  S.C. 558, 562, 544 S.E.2d 646, 648 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"A statute allowing attorney \r\n  fees is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed.\") (citations \r\n  omitted)). Applying this standard by analogy when reading the SCRCP, we conclude \r\n  the Circuit Court has no power to sanction a party to pay the other party's \r\n  attorney's fees in a dispute over payment of money in a settlement agreement.\r\n\r\nIV. Settlement Agreement\r\n\r\nBecause no statutory authority exists to grant \r\n  attorney's fees in this situation, we must look to the language of the settlement \r\n  agreement itself to determine whether its terms provided for the payment of \r\n  attorney's fees in the case of breach. Settlement agreements are viewed as contracts \r\n  between the parties. See Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice \r\n  Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 343 S.C. 335, 540 S.E.2d 843 (2001) (holding \r\n  the enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement is a contract and viewed \r\n  as an action at law); Estate of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 484 S.E.2d \r\n  112 (Ct. App. 1997) (using contractual interpretation standard regarding ambiguous \r\n  language to determine whether to admit parol evidence about a property settlement \r\n  agreement); Arnold v. Yarborough, 281 S.C. 570, 316 S.E.2d 416 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984) (holding that once attorneys agree to settle a case, the settlement cannot \r\n  be repudiated unless fraud exists); Hall v. General Exch. Ins. Corp. of N.Y., \r\n  169 S.C. 384, 169 S.E. 78 (1933) (ruling that punitive damages are not available \r\n  for a breach of settlement agreement unless the breach of contract is accompanied \r\n  by a fraudulent act).\r\n\r\nThe language of the settlement agreement between \r\n  the Jenkinses and Nissan Car Mart does not provide for either party to collect \r\n  attorney's fees in case of a breach of the agreement. The letter to the Jenkinses' \r\n  lawyer states that Nissan Car Mart offered $20,000 to settle any and all claims \r\n  for the current pending litigation. The Jenkinses' lawyer's letter in return \r\n  merely stated the Jenkinses accepted the cash settlement. No other terms were \r\n  added. Courts are not allowed to add terms to an unambiguous contract. C.A.N. \r\n  Enters., Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 296 \r\n  S.C. 373, 378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1988) (\"We are without authority to alter \r\n  a contract by construction or to make new contracts for the parties. Our duty \r\n  is limited to the contract made by the parties themselves 'â€¦ regardless of its \r\n  wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or failure to guard their rights \r\n  carefully.'\") (citations omitted). Since there was no contractual language providing \r\n  that one party receive attorney's fees for a breach of the agreement and there \r\n  is no statutory authority to award attorney's fees, the Circuit Court erred \r\n  when it imposed a sanction on Nissan Car Mart requiring it to pay attorney's \r\n  fees to the Jenkinses.\r\n\r\nV. Civil Contempt/Attorney \r\n  Fees\r\n\r\nCourts, by exercising their contempt power, can \r\n  award attorney's fees under a compensatory contempt theory. Compensatory contempt \r\n  seeks to reimburse the party for the costs it incurs in forcing the non-complying \r\n  party to obey the court's orders. See Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. \r\n  106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1998) (\"In a civil contempt proceeding, a contemnor \r\n  may be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred in enforcing \r\n  the court's prior order, including reasonable attorney's fees. The award of \r\n  attorney's fees is not a punishment but an indemnification to the party who \r\n  instituted the contempt proceeding.\"); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, \r\n  345, 491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"A compensatory contempt award may \r\n  include attorney fees.\") (citation omitted); Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. \r\n  377, 386-87, 287 S.E.2d 915, 919-20 (1982) (\"Compensatory contempt is a money \r\n  award for the plaintiff when the defendant has injured the plaintiff by violating \r\n  a previous court orderâ€¦. Included in the actual loss are the costs of defending \r\n  and enforcing the court's order, including litigation costs and attorney's fees.\"). \r\n  In this case, the judge's order did not find Nissan Car Mart in contempt and \r\n  we cannot assume he was exercising the contempt power when he awarded attorney's \r\n  fees to the Jenkinses. The order only refers to his actions as sanctions.\r\n\r\nWe note and emphasize that South Carolina law does \r\n  not permit a person to be held in contempt for failure to pay a civil debt, \r\n  which has arisen solely out of a contractual obligation. Sanders v. Sanders, \r\n  30 S.C. 229, 9 S.E. 97 (1889). Furthermore, the Constitution of South Carolina \r\n  provides \"[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt except in cases of fraud.\" \r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 19; see also Carter v. Lynch, 429 F.2d 154 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1970); Stidham v. DuBose, 128 S.C. 318, 121 S.E. 791 (1924).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the order of the Circuit Court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Rule 54 does not create \r\n  a right to attorney's fees without authorization from a statute. Black v. \r\n  Roche Biomedical Labs., 315 S.C. 223, 433 S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (\"Rule 54(d) â€¦ provide[s] that a prevailing party shall \r\n  ordinarily be entitled to recover certain costs and disbursements.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1997, the Charleston County School \r\n  District (\"the School District\") entered into a written contract with Laidlaw \r\n  and the South Carolina Department of Education (\"the Department of Education\"), \r\n  whereby Laidlaw agreed to provide school bus transportation for the School District. \r\n  Under the terms of the contract, Laidlaw was to use the Department of Education's \r\n  school buses, and assumed the responsibility to transport students from January \r\n  21, 1997 until June 2000. The contract was based upon a traditional 180-day \r\n  schedule for each school within the School District, and contained the following \r\n  clauses in anticipation of changing demands or requirements for transportation \r\n  during the term of the contract:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Paragraph 4.  Method of Payment. In return \r\n    for the services to be provided herein, [the School District] agrees to compensate \r\n    LAIDLAW in the amount of 4,631,000 dollars annually (PRO-RATED FOR 96-97 REMAINING \r\n    YEAR) said sum is to be paid directly by check or indirectly in the form of \r\n    credits, as more fully set forth on Addendum I, attached hereto and incorporated \r\n    herein.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddendum I provides a four percent rate increase \r\n  each year and further states \"[a]s programs/schools are added or removed and \r\n  as enrollment changes the cost of transportation will increase or decrease on \r\n  a prorata [sic.] bus basis based on the existing contract.\" \r\n\r\nFinally, Paragraph 9 contains the following provisions:\r\n\r\n\r\n  a. In the event of reduced funding, the level of \r\n    service provided to [the School District] by LAIDLAW may be reduced in pro-rata \r\n    fashion, the specific services to be reduced to be negotiated between [the \r\n    School District] and LAIDLAW, and approved by [the Department of Education], \r\n    commensurate with the reduced funding level.\r\n\r\n  b. If the costs of operating the system exceed \r\n    the agreed amount currently projected to be appropriated for [the School District] \r\n    by the General Assembly, as contemplated hereunder, LAIDLAW shall be responsible \r\n    for notifying [the School District] of any such excess costs and identifying \r\n    the specific reasons therefor. [The School District] shall be responsible \r\n    for such excess costs only upon receipt of the notice as provided herein and \r\n    upon specific acceptance of responsibility therefor. Under no circumstances \r\n    will LAIDLAW obligate [the School District] or hold [the School District] \r\n    responsible for any costs/expenses which are not specifically addressed and \r\n    identified herein or contemplated under this Agreement, unless [the School \r\n    District] specifically agrees to such. (underlining in original)\r\n\r\n\r\n The School District brought this declaratory judgment \r\n  action when it discovered alleged overpayments to Laidlaw for bus services during \r\n  the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 school years. The School District also anticipated \r\n  an overcharge would be forthcoming from Laidlaw for the ensuing year. \r\n\r\nIn its answer, Laidlaw admitted the written contract, \r\n  but denied receiving any overpayment. Laidlaw asserted that the services it \r\n  provided had increased because (1) it had to provide the buses used for transportation; \r\n  (2) routes were extended or originally understated in length, and (3) additional \r\n  routes and students were added by the School District to accommodate magnet \r\n  schools, additional riders, and other activities. Laidlaw also asserted counterclaims \r\n  for set-off and/or payment for the extra services rendered under equitable causes \r\n  of action, namely, quantum meruit, contract implied in law, and promissory estoppel. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe School District moved to dismiss the equitable \r\n  counterclaims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, on the grounds that the contract \r\n  was admitted, and its terms specifically governed any expansion of services \r\n  or costs, precluding recovery in equity under theories of quantum meruit, implied \r\n  contract or promissory estoppel. The circuit court agreed, dismissing Laidlaw's \r\n  counterclaims. Laidlaw appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nA motion to dismiss a counterclaim must be based \r\n  solely on the allegations set forth in the counterclaim. See Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP; Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, \r\n  73 (1999). \"A Rule 12(b)(6) motion may not be sustained if facts alleged and \r\n  inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the [complainant] to \r\n  any relief on any theory of the case.\" Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, \r\n  300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602-3 (1995). The question is whether in the light most \r\n  favorable to the complainant, and with every doubt resolved on his behalf, the \r\n  counterclaim states any valid claim for relief. Toussaint v. Ham, 292 \r\n  S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987). The counterclaim should not be dismissed \r\n  merely because the trial court doubts the complainant will prevail in the action. \r\n  Id. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nLaidlaw contends it was entitled pursuant to Rule \r\n  8(e)(2), SCRCP, (1) to plead its equitable counterclaims \r\n  as alternative causes of action. \r\n\r\nInitially, we note the circuit court did not require \r\n  Laidlaw to elect between its causes of actions. Instead, the circuit court dismissed \r\n  Laidlaw's equitable counterclaims because there was a specific contract between \r\n  the parties and they were limited to that contract. Consequently, the court \r\n  concluded the equitable issues were not available to Laidlaw.\r\n\r\n\"It is well settled that parties are judicially \r\n  bound by their pleadings unless withdrawn, altered or stricken by amendment \r\n  or otherwise.\" Postal v. Mann, 308 S.C. 385, 387, 418 S.E.2d 322, 323 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1992). Any allegations, statements, or admissions contained in a pleading \r\n  are conclusive against the pleader, and a party cannot subsequently take a contrary \r\n  or inconsistent position. Id.; see Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Carroll, \r\n  314 S.C. 468, 445 S.E.2d 466 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\nHere, both the Complaint and the Answer and Counterclaim \r\n  allege the existence of the same written contract. By its plain terms, the admitted \r\n  contract controls the services to be performed and the compensation to be paid. \r\n  Paragraph 9 of the contract explicitly governs the expansion of services and \r\n  Laidlaw's entitlement to payment for associated costs and expenses. Therefore, \r\n  Laidlaw's entitlement to payment of consideration is determined by its performance \r\n  under the terms of the contract. By admitting the contract and its terms, including \r\n  paragraph 9, the parties have defined their relationship, and their rights and \r\n  obligations are governed solely by the contract terms. \r\n   (2) \r\n\r\nLaidlaw contends that its allegation in the Answer \r\n  and Counterclaim that the additional work was performed outside of the contract \r\n  must be accepted as true in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, thereby creating a factual \r\n  issue as to whether the written contract governs the controversy. We find this \r\n  argument to be without merit. Laidlaw's allegations clearly describe an extension \r\n  of the same services as those required under the original contract. The characterization \r\n  of the activity as \"outside the contract\" is not an allegation of fact, but \r\n  is an unsupported conclusion which is contrary to the admitted facts. Therefore, \r\n  the trial judge properly disregarded it. See Gaskins v. S. Farm Bureau \r\n  Cas. Ins. Co., 343 S.C. 666, 671, 541 S.E.2d 269, 271 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, replaces the Code Pleading rules regarding demurrers and \r\n  \"retains the Code Pleading standard . . . rather than the more lenient notice \r\n  pleading standard found in the federal rules.\") (citation omitted); Charleston \r\n  County Sch. Dist. v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 283 S.C. 48, 50, 320 S.E.2d \r\n  727, 729 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"A demurrer admits the facts well pleaded in the complaint \r\n  but does not admit the inferences drawn by the plaintiff from the facts, nor \r\n  does it admit conclusions of law.\"); Sease v. City of Spartanburg, 242 \r\n  S.C. 520, 527, 131 S.E.2d 683, 687 (1963) (finding allegations in the complaint \r\n  which merely characterize the facts are mere conclusions which are not admitted \r\n  by a demurrer).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit \r\n  court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n1.  \"A party may set forth two \r\n  or more statements of a cause of action or defense alternatively or hypothetically \r\n  . . . regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or on equitable grounds \r\n  or on both.\" Rule 8(e)(2), SCRCP \r\n2.  Laidlaw also argues the \r\n  trial court dismissed the counterclaims on the erroneous belief that equitable \r\n  claims were precluded against a public entity. We find this argument to be without \r\n  merit. The trial court's ruling was clearly not based on this premise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3430","title":"Barret v.

Barrett appealed her termination to the school board, which voted to terminate.  She appealed to the Circuit Court, which reversed the school board.  Applying the substantial evidence test, the Court of Appeals held substantial evidence existed in the record to support the school board's decision to terminate because Barrett manifested an evident unfitness for teaching based on her dishonesty in dealing with the ice cream account.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court.","date":"2001-12-31","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Roberta Barrett, \r\n          Respondent,\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    v.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Charleston County School District, \r\n          Appellant.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Charleston County\r\n  A.

Barrett appealed her termination \r\n  to the Circuit Court, which reversed the School Board's determination and reinstated \r\n  her to her teaching position. The School Board appeals the Circuit Court's ruling. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Barrett was terminated from her teaching position at Laing Middle School for dishonesty regarding her actions in\r\nhandling an ice cream sales account and her representations on a grant application form to Wal-Mart to fund a drama club trip\r\nand related activities.  Barrett appealed her termination to the Charleston County School Board, which affirmed her\r\ntermination, 4-1.  Barrett appealed the School Board's decision to the Circuit Court, which reversed the School Board's\r\ndecision and reinstated Barrett.  The Circuit Court also ordered that Barrett be compensated for executing her duties in\r\npreparing to teach in a 1999 summer program for gifted students.  The School Board appeals the Circuit Court's decision.\r\n\r\nBarrett began teaching at Laing Middle School in 1986.\r\nHer teaching roles were as the computer teacher, and then as the\r\ndrama teacher.  She also taught in the school's gifted student program during the summer months.  During the 1993 school\r\nyear, in an effort to raise money for the school for technology upgrades and other improvements, Laing Middle School, in\r\nconjunction with the Laing Parent Teacher Student Organization (\"PTSO\"), began a program selling ice cream to the Laing\r\nstudents after lunch. The ice cream was sold to the students at fifty cents a serving with an average unit cost of  twenty-five\r\ncents a serving.  A checking account was opened at NationsBank, which was dedicated solely to handling the ice cream\r\nproceeds and expenditures.\r\n\r\nSince the lion's share of the profits from the ice cream account were earmarked for technology upgrades, and Barrett was the\r\ncomputer teacher, Barrett was involved in the operation of the ice cream program from its inception.  Her initial role was\r\nlimited to rolling coins, counting the money, and making deposits into the account.\r\nFrom 1993-1995, Norma Kulseth\r\nmaintained the books and was responsible for writing the checks to pay the ice cream vendor.\r\nDuring the school year of 1995-1996, Jennifer Coe assumed the duties of maintaining the books and writing the checks to pay the vendor.  During their\r\nrespective tenures, Kulseth and Coe kept specific records regarding the deposits made and checks written to and from the\r\naccount. From 1993-1996, the ice cream account showed substantial profits and both Kulseth and Coe testified money was\r\nalways available in the account to pay the ice cream vendor.\r\n\r\nBy 1996, the PTSO had spent a substantial amount of the ice cream proceeds on technology upgrades and a discussion was\r\nheld about the future use of the ice cream monies.  Barrett was now the drama teacher and in the summer of 1996, during a\r\nmeeting between Kulseth, Barrett, and Walt Pusey, the Laing principal, Barrett assumed total control over the ice cream\r\naccount.   In addition to collecting and counting the money, Barrett's duties now included making the deposits, writing the\r\nchecks, and accounting for the funds.\r\n\r\n From the beginning, the technical operation of the ice cream program  was a slipshod affair with no internal controls in place\r\nat any step of the operation.  Pusey did not oversee the ice cream account, even though this task was within the purview of his\r\nduties as the principal.  The ice cream was kept in a separate freezer dedicated solely to the ice cream sales program and was\r\nrefilled by the ice cream delivery driver without anyone from the school checking the invoices to make certain that all the ice\r\ncream purchased was actually delivered.  The money box used to make change by volunteers and teachers who sold the ice\r\ncream was kept in a cabinet that was unlocked during the day and was without a log-in/log-out procedure to know who had the\r\nbox on a particular day.  There was not even a standardized amount of change kept in the money box from day to day to\r\ndetermine if the person selling the ice cream on that particular day was stealing money.  No records were kept of how much ice\r\ncream was sold to the children on a given day, given away, or sold at cost to the teachers.  The lack of internal controls made it\r\nimpossible to determine how much profit was made by the ice cream sales, or if any profit was made at all.  There were also\r\nisolated incidents of spoilage and vandalism that occurred throughout the ice cream sales program that were not recorded or\r\ntaken into account when determining whether or not the program was profitable.\r\n\r\nIn October 1998, Pusey informed Barrett that the PTSO wished to have a more active role in the ice cream account and that the\r\nproceeds would now go into a PTSO account rather than the separate dedicated ice cream account.  Christine Milroth took over\r\nthe bookkeeping and check-writing duties while Barrett continued to collect, count, and deposit the funds.  In December 1998,\r\nMilroth determined there were insufficient funds in the account to pay the outstanding ice cream bill.  Milroth began\r\ninvestigating the account. Suspicions were raised regarding Barrett's handling of the account when the account balance fell\r\nextremely short of the expected profits during the 1997-98 school year.  The method the school used to estimate profits was to\r\ntake the number of units purchased from the vendor and multiply it by twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nDianne Thomas, the Charleston County School District Auditor, was asked to audit the account for the years 1996-98, the\r\nperiod of time where Barrett had exclusive control over the account.  Thomas determined the account revealed a $19,000\r\ndifference between actual money taken in and the amount of the expected profit.  When Thomas reviewed the activities of the\r\naccount during Barrett's tenure, she discovered Barrett had written personal checks to the account on several occasions. \r\nBarrett's very first act when coming into sole control of the account was to write a $2,000 check out of the ice cream account,\r\nemptying the account, to her mother-in-law's account, over which Barrett had the power to withdraw money.  Also, Barrett did\r\nnot keep detailed records about the amounts deposited into the account, nor did she record invoices, in contrast to the record\r\nkeeping techniques used by Kulseth and Coe.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to determine Barrett's honesty, Milroth arranged a test situation where Barrett was given money to count and\r\ndeposit into the PTSO account.  Barrett was told that the money was uncounted.  In actuality, the money had already been\r\ncounted and the exact amount of the expected deposit was known. Barrett's actual deposit was less than the amount of money\r\ngiven to her to be deposited.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Barrett wanted to take her drama club students on a field trip to New York City.  Pusey denied her request for the trip\r\nto be a school-sponsored trip. In an effort to independently raise money for the trip, Barrett and her drama club students began\r\nselling candy outside of a local Wal-Mart. Barrett was informed that Wal-Mart had a matching grant program after a store \r\nmanager noticed what Barrett and her students were doing. Wal-Mart instituted the grant program to foster good will in the\r\ncommunity and to receive a tax break.  However, Wal-Mart could only obtain the tax break by giving the money to certain\r\ntypes of organizations, not individuals.  On the grant application form, Barrett checked the box stating she was representing a\r\nschool organization, which was the option closest to a drama club.\r\n\r\nWal-Mart awarded Barrett $1,000 based on the grant application.  Barrett took the money and deposited it into her personal\r\naccount rather than the school account. Barrett kept close track of the proceeds and their distribution from her personal\r\naccount.  Each student who went on the trip received $50 and Barrett kept receipts that showed the remaining proceeds, $500,\r\nwere spent on a production given at a local nursing home.  These receipts were offered to Wal-Mart.  The School Board cited\r\nthe handling of the grant application and the discrepancies in the ice cream account as grounds for dishonesty warranting\r\nimmediate termination.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\nUsing the proper standard of review is critical \r\n  to determine the proper outcome in this case. Barrett argues the correct standard \r\n  of review when evaluating a decision to terminate a teacher for evident unfitness \r\n  is proof the conduct demonstrating the evident unfitness be undeniably and abundantly \r\n  present. We disagree. South Carolina case law is clear and unambiguous respecting \r\n  the proper standard of review regarding the propriety of a teacher's termination. \r\n  It is the substantial evidence test. See Felder v. Charleston County \r\n  Sch. Dist., 327 S.C. 21, 489 S.E.2d 191 (1997); Kizer v. Dorchester County \r\n  Vocational Educ. Bd. of Trustees., 287 S.C. 545, 340 S.E.2d 144 (1986); \r\n  Lexington County Sch. Dist. One Bd. of Trustees v. Bost, 282 S.C. 32, \r\n  316 S.E.2d 677 (1984); Laws v. Richland County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 270 \r\n  S.C. 492, 243 S.E.2d 192 (1978); Barr v. Board of Trustees of Clarendon County \r\n  Sch. Dist. No. 2, 319 S.C. 522, 462 S.E.2d 316 (Ct. App. 1995); Hendrickson \r\n  v. Spartanburg County Sch. Dist. No. Five, 307 S.C. 108, 413 S.E.2d 871 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1992); Hilliard v. Orangeburg County Sch. Dist. No. Three, \r\n  300 S.C. 123, 386 S.E.2d 628 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\n\r\nBarrett cites Kizer v. Dorchester County Vocational \r\n  Education Board of Trustees, 287 S.C. 545, 340 S.E.2d 144 (1986) and Hall \r\n  v. Board of Trustees of Sumter County School District Number 2, 330 S.C. \r\n  402, 499 S.E.2d 216 (Ct. App. 1998), as authority to state that proof of conduct \r\n  must be undeniably and abundantly present. Barrett misapprehends these cases. \r\n  In Kizer, the Supreme Court was merely typifying the evidence as undeniably \r\n  and abundantly present, not articulating a new standard: \"Therefore, the officially \r\n  enunciated public policy of this State is to provide for immediate removal of \r\n  those whose conduct manifests evident unfitness. Such conduct is undeniably \r\n  and abundantly present in this case.\" Id. at 550, 340 S.E.2d at 147. \r\n  Earlier in the Kizer opinion, however, the Court stated that the substantial \r\n  evidence test was the proper test. Id. at 548, 340 S.E.2d at 146. Although \r\n  the Hall case references the \"undeniably and abundantly present\" language in \r\n  Kizer, a reading of the entire Hall opinion makes clear that the court \r\n  is not declaring a new standard of review but is applying the substantial evidence \r\n  test.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this Court is limited to examining the \r\n  record to determine whether substantial evidence existed to support the School \r\n  Board's decision to terminate Barrett for dishonesty in her dealings with the \r\n  ice cream account and the Wal-Mart grant application. \"The court cannot substitute \r\n  its judgment for that of the school board.\" Felder, 327 S.C. at 25, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d at 193 (citation omitted). \"'Substantial evidence' is not a mere scintilla \r\n  of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is \r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds \r\n  to reach the conclusion that the Board reached or must have reached in order \r\n  to justify its action.\" Laws, 270 S.C. at 495-96, 243 S.E.2d at 193 (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBarrett is a contract teacher.  As such, the rules regarding her termination fall under the South Carolina Teacher Employment\r\nand Dismissal Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 59-25-410 to -530.  It is undisputed that the School Board immediately terminated\r\nBarrett's employment without providing for a remedial corrective period.  The statute provides for certain situations where a\r\nSchool Board can immediately terminate a teacher:\r\n\r\n\r\nAny teacher may be dismissed at any time who â€¦ manifest[s] an evident unfitness for teachingâ€¦. Evident unfitness for\r\nteaching is manifested by conduct such as, but not limited to, the following: persistent neglect of duty, willful violation of rules\r\nand regulations of district board of trustees, drunkenness, conviction of a violation of the law of this State or the United States,\r\ngross immorality, dishonesty, illegal use, sale or possession of drugs or narcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-25-430 (1990).\r\n\r\nI.  Ice Cream Account\r\n\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record to support the School Board's finding that Barrett was dishonest in her dealings with\r\nthe ice cream account.\r\n\r\nA.  The $2,000 Check\r\n\r\nOne of Barrett's first actions when she took over exclusive control of the ice cream account was to empty the account by\r\nwriting a $2,000 check to her mother-in-law's personal checking account.  Barrett had signatory power to withdraw money\r\nfrom her mother-in-law's account.  When asked about her reason for writing the check to her mother-in-law's account, Barrett\r\nresponded that it was to reimburse her mother-in-law for paying invoices that were due to the ice cream vendor.\r\nHowever,\r\nBarrett testified that she never called her mother-in-law's bank to verify whether her mother-in-law had actually paid the\r\nmoney to cover the ice cream account before writing her the $2,000 check. There was also evidence in the record stating that\r\nthe amount actually owed the ice cream vendor for the period of time the $2,000 check covered was only $1,100.\r\n\r\nB.  Barrett's Personal Checks Written to the Ice Cream Account\r\n\r\nDuring Barrett's tenure of exclusive control over the ice cream account, a pattern emerged where she would periodically write\r\nchecks from her personal account to the ice cream account.  It is noteworthy that Kulseth and Coe did not write checks from\r\ntheir personal accounts to the ice cream account when they controlled the ice cream account.  Testimony revealed Barrett wrote\r\nthese personal checks to the ice cream account at times when funds were needed to cover checks written to the ice cream\r\nvendor, and always for an amount just enough to cover the amount due the vendor.  This fact coincided with Barrett's practice\r\nof taking the proceeds from the ice cream sales home and not making deposits for weeks at a time.  Barrett's stated reason for\r\nwriting personal checks to the ice cream account was to reimburse the account for rolled coins she gave her daughter for her\r\ndaughter's coin collection.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are only concerned with the existence of evidence and not its weight, it strains the limits of credulity to think that\r\nBarrett gave her child $1,300 in coins over a two year period.  Substantial evidence exists in the record to support the School\r\nBoard's belief that Barrett was taking the money home and only putting enough money in to pay the bills, thus ensuring the ice\r\ncream account would break even while enabling her to keep any excess for herself.\r\n\r\nC.  Short Deposits\r\n\r\nEven after Barrett relinquished exclusive control of the ice cream account, she remained involved by counting money and\r\nmaking deposits into the account.  When examinations and audits of the ice cream account revealed suspicions about Barrett's\r\nhandling of the account, Milroth and Cindy Hamlin,  the PTSO bookkeeper, designed a scenario to test Barrett's honesty.  They\r\ngave Barrett money from the ice cream proceeds and told her it had not been counted.  They then instructed Barrett to count the\r\nmoney and call the amount in to Milroth.  In fact, the money had already been counted and the amount that Barrett should have\r\nsubmitted to Milroth was known.  This method was used to test Barrett's veracity on two separate occasions.  The first time,\r\nBarrett submitted a figure that was $30 less than the counted amount.  The second time, Barrett reported an amount that was\r\n$14 less.\r\n\r\nJust after Milroth took over the ice cream account and determined that there were insufficient funds to cover the pending ice\r\ncream bill, she took a comprehensive inventory and kept meticulous records about what had been sold to the children during\r\nthe period.  By doing this, Milroth knew exactly how much money should have been collected during this period.  She called\r\nBarrett to find out how much money had been collected during this time.  Barrett responded that the amount was $300.  When\r\nMilroth stated the amount should be $460, Barrett increased her figure to $350 stating she had not counted all the coins.  Five\r\ndays later, Barrett actually deposited only $185 into the account, an amount just enough to cover the pending ice cream invoice. \r\nThe evidence of the short deposits is the most damaging evidence to Barrett's position that substantial evidence did not exist to\r\nsupport the School Board's finding because these are specific instances where records were kept to determine exactly how\r\nmuch money should have been deposited and every time, the amounts actually deposited were significantly less.\r\n\r\nD.  Shoddy Recordkeeping\r\n\r\nWhile cross-examining Barrett, the School Board's counsel asked Barrett questions regarding what records she kept of the\r\naccount.  Barrett admitted she did not keep a ledger, did not reconcile the bank statements, and did not keep specific track of\r\nthe amount of money in the account. She did admit to maintaining a check register; however, she never recorded any of the\r\npersonal checks she wrote as deposits to the ice cream account.  Barrett testified that she was just following the procedures of\r\nher predecessors who handled the account.  However, the testimony of Kulseth and Coe showed they both kept more complete\r\nrecords regarding the ice cream account than Barrett did.\r\n\r\nBarrett also stated a reason for her method of keeping records for the account was she was not a good record keeper.\r\nThe\r\nSchool Board could doubt this testimony in light of her handling the funds from the Wal-Mart grant that were deposited in her\r\nown personal account.  When Barrett received the grant from Wal-Mart, she gave every student who went on the field trip $50\r\nand spent the remaining $500 on the production costs for a play given at a nursing home.  In contrast of her handling of the ice\r\ncream account, she kept and noted every receipt of the expenditures made from the grant.  Her handling of the grant money is\r\nsubstantial evidence that Barrett could keep adequate financial records when it suited her to do so.  The contrast in her handling\r\nof the grant money in combination with her lack of keeping adequate records of the ice cream account, especially her failure to\r\nrecord her personal checks made to the ice cream account as deposits, is substantial evidence supporting the School Board's\r\nfinding that Barrett was seeking to conceal her activities regarding the ice cream account.\r\n\r\nII.  Wal-Mart Grant Application\r\n\r\nConsidering our decision that substantial evidence existed in the record to support the School Board's decision to terminate\r\nBarrett for dishonesty from her dealings with the ice cream account, we do not need to reach whether substantial evidence\r\nexisted to show Barrett was dishonest in her representations on the Wal-Mart application.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nApplying the substantial evidence test, we hold that substantial evidence existed in the record to support the School Board's\r\ndecision to terminate Barrett because she manifested an evident unfitness for teaching based on her dishonesty in dealing with\r\nthe ice cream account.  Accordingly, we reverse the Circuit Court's decision to reinstate and reimburse Barrett.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
