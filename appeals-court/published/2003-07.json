Strickland, Master-In-Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3658\r\nHeard March 11, 2003 â€“ Filed July 7, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDavid Randolph Whitt, Henry Guyton Murrel, and Pearce W. Fleming, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\nHoward S. Sheftman and J. Alton Bivens, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  In this foreclosure action, \r\n  we are asked to determine whether a promissory note secured by a real estate \r\n  mortgage is a negotiable instrument governed by Article 3 of the South Carolina \r\n  Uniform Commercial Code (â€œUCCâ€).Â  James R. Swindler, Marshalene S. Frady, and \r\n  Rebecca Spears (collectively, â€œthe Swindler Familyâ€) brought this action against \r\n  their sister-in-law, Nancy Swindler (â€œNancyâ€), to foreclose a mortgage encumbering \r\n  a 54.5-acre tract of land Nancy purchased from their mother, Margaret Swindler \r\n  (â€œMargaretâ€).Â  Nancy asserted various defenses, including that Margaret had \r\n  renounced the underlying debt by giving Nancy possession of the original Note.Â  \r\n  The master-in-equity concluded Article 3 of the UCC did not govern the transaction, \r\n  and therefore, the defense of renunciation under South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 36-3-605(1) (1976) [1]  \r\n  was not applicable.Â  The master entered a judgment of foreclosure and sale in \r\n  favor of the Swindler Family.Â  Nancy appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMargaret had four children â€“ the three Respondents \r\n  to whom we refer as the Swindler Family and a son, Timothy.Â  Timothy was married \r\n  to Nancy.Â  During Timothyâ€™s lifetime, Margaret conveyed a 54.5-acre tract of \r\n  land to Nancy to be Nancy and Timothyâ€™s residence.Â  In return, Nancy executed \r\n  a note, agreeing to pay Margaret $200,000.00 for the property.Â  The Note was \r\n  secured by a mortgage covering the property.\r\nAfter both Margaret and Timothy died, James Swindler \r\n  attempted to transfer a one-quarter interest in the Note and Mortgage to each \r\n  member of the Swindler Family in his capacity as personal representative of \r\n  Margaretâ€™s estate.Â  The Swindler Family then demanded payment of $150,000.00 \r\n  from Nancy, representing three-quarters of the amount due on the Note, and brought \r\n  this foreclosure action.\r\nNancy asserted as a defense that Margaret had renounced \r\n  the debt by delivering the original Note to her.Â  In support of her position, \r\n  Nancy cited section 36-3-605(1), which states in applicable part: â€œThe holder \r\n  of an instrument may even without consideration discharge any party . . . (b) \r\n  by renouncing his rights . . . by surrender of the instrument to be discharged.â€ \r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  During the trial, only Nancy testified and presented witnesses.Â  \r\n  Nancy established the Note and Mortgage had been sent to Margaret before execution, \r\n  and Margaret delivered the original Note and Mortgage to Nancy and Timothy before \r\n  her death.Â  The Swindler Family admitted Nancy has possession of the original \r\n  Note and Mortgage.\r\nThe master declined to apply section 36-3-605.Â  He \r\n  construed South Carolina Code Annotated section 36-3-103(2) (1976), [2]  governing negotiable instruments under Article \r\n  3, to superimpose the limitations of Article 9 onto Article 3.Â  Because Article \r\n  9 of the UCC, specifically South Carolina Code Annotated section 36-9-104(j) \r\n  (Supp. 2000), excludes from its application â€œthe creation or transfer of an \r\n  interest in or lien on real estate[,]â€ the master ruled Article 3 did not apply \r\n  to notes secured by mortgages on real estate.Â  He also found no evidence existed \r\n  to prove how Nancy obtained the original Note and Mortgage or to establish Margaret \r\n  intended Nancyâ€™s obligation to be discharged.Â  Therefore, he ruled the Swindler \r\n  Family was a proper holder of the Note and $150,000.00 was due.Â  The master \r\n  entered a judgment of foreclosure and sale in favor of the Swindler Family.Â  \r\n  Nancy filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the master denied.Â  \r\n  Nancy appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to foreclose a real estate mortgage \r\n  is an action in equity.â€Â  BB&amp;T of South Carolina v. Kidwell, 350 \r\n  S.C. 382, 387, 565 S.E.2d 316, 319 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  On appeal from an action \r\n  in equity, this Court may â€œfind facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.â€Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. \r\n  81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  Furthermore, this Court is not bound by \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s legal determinations.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (2000).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAmong the issues raised on appeal, Nancy asserts \r\n  the master erred by ruling Article 3 of the UCC does not govern a note secured \r\n  by a mortgage on real property.Â  Furthermore, pursuant to section 36-3-605(1), \r\n  Nancy argues a presumption arose that Margaret renounced the debt because Margaret \r\n  delivered the Note to Nancy prior to her death, and the Swindler family failed \r\n  to present any evidence to overcome the presumption.Â  We agree with both assertions \r\n  and reverse the masterâ€™s order.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Applicability of Article 3\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno \r\n  Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003).Â  Moreover, \r\n  â€œ[w]here the terms of the statute are clear, [this Court] must apply those terms \r\n  according to their literal meaning.â€Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; \r\n  Envtl Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002); see also \r\n  Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 369, 468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996) (holding \r\n  when â€œinterpreting a statute, words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning \r\n  without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s \r\n  operationâ€).\r\nArticle 3 applies to negotiable instruments.Â  Thus, \r\n  as an initial matter, we must determine whether the Note is a negotiable instrument \r\n  and a â€œnoteâ€ as defined by Article 3 of the UCC.Â  If not, then Article 3 would \r\n  clearly not apply and our inquiry would end.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 36-3-104 \r\n  (1976) provides:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Any writing to be a negotiable instrument within this chapter \r\n  must\r\n  \r\n  (a)&nbsp; be signed by the maker or drawer; and\r\n  (b) contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money \r\n  and no other promise, order, obligation or power given by the maker or drawer \r\n  except as authorized by this chapter; and\r\n  (c)&nbsp; be payable on demand or at a definite time; and\r\n  (d) be payable to order or to bearer.\r\n  \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; A writing which complies with the requirements of this section \r\n  is\r\n\r\n.Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â  .\r\n\r\n  \r\n  (d) a â€œnoteâ€ if it is a promise other than a certificate of deposit.\r\n  \r\n\r\nClearly each of these requirements is met in this \r\n  case.Â  Furthermore, neither party asserts the instrument fails to satisfy the \r\n  above criteria.\r\nHaving determined the Note is a negotiable instrument \r\n  and a â€œnote,â€ we next consider the masterâ€™s conclusion Article 3 does not apply \r\n  to a note secured by a real estate mortgage.Â  In this regard, it appears the \r\n  master misread section 36-3-103(2).Â  This section states â€œ[t]he provisions of \r\n  this chapter are subject to the provisions of the chapter on . . . secured transactions \r\n  [(Article 9)].â€Â  The master construed this statute to act as a limitation on \r\n  the application of Article 3 so as to exclude from coverage a note secured by \r\n  a real estate mortgage.Â  He bolstered his decision by noting â€œthe existence \r\n  of S.C. Code Â§ 29-3-330, which expressly provides methods for satisfying a mortgage \r\n  of real estate.â€\r\nWe conclude the master erred.Â  No provision in \r\n  Article 3 exists which distinguishes an unsecured note from a note secured by \r\n  a real estate mortgage.Â  Moreover, no provision in Article 9 excludes a note \r\n  secured by a real estate mortgage from the application of Article 3.Â  The negotiability \r\n  of a note is not altered by the execution of a related real estate mortgage.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-3-119(2) (1976) (stating a note remains subject \r\n  to the terms of Article 3 irrespective of the occurrence of any other transaction); \r\n  cf. Intâ€™l Minerals &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Matthews, 321 S.E.2d 545, \r\n  547 (N.C. Ct. App. 1984) (holding â€œincorporating into a note the liens that \r\n  secure its paymentâ€ does not affect the applicability of Article 3).\r\nThe Official Comment to section 36-3-119(2) states:\r\n\r\n5.Â  Subsection (2) rejects decisions which have carried the \r\n  rule that contemporaneous writings must be read together to the length of holding \r\n  that a clause in a mortgage affecting a note destroyed the negotiability of \r\n  the note.Â  The negotiability of an instrument is always to be determined by \r\n  what appears on the face of the instrument alone . . . .Â  [If the note] \r\n  merely refers to a separate agreement or states that it arises out of such an \r\n  agreement, it is negotiable.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  Furthermore, any â€œcontemporaneous \r\n  writing[,] e.g., a chattel mortgage given to secure a negotiable note[,] \r\n  is not read into the note to destroy its negotiability.â€Â  Id. reporterâ€™s \r\n  cmt (emphasis added); cf. Burch v. Ashburn, 295 S.C. 274, 278, \r\n  368 S.E.2d 82, 84 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œ[T]he contemporaneous execution of the two \r\n  writings does not affect the note, which is enforceable according to its tenor \r\n  without regard to any breach of theâ€ other agreement.).Â Â  Thus, even when executed \r\n  simultaneously with a mortgage, a note remains subject to the provisions of \r\n  Article 3.Â  See Northwestern Bank v. Neal, 271 S.C. 544, 546-47, \r\n  248 S.E.2d 585, 586 (1978).\r\nFurthermore, we do not agree with the masterâ€™s \r\n  construction of sections 36&#8209;3&#8209;103(2) and 36-9-104(j).Â  We conclude \r\n  these provisions are unambiguous and clearly state Article 3 governs a note \r\n  even when secured by a mortgage on real property.\r\nFirst, the master misquoted section 36-3-103(2) \r\n  to state Article 3 was subject to the â€œlimitationsâ€ of Article 9.Â  However, \r\n  this section states â€œ[t]he provisions of this chapter are subject to the provisions \r\n  of the chapter on . . . secured transactions [Article 9]â€ not â€œlimitations of \r\n  Article 9â€ as stated in the masterâ€™s order.Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Article 9 provides \r\n  it does not apply â€œto the creation or transfer of an interest in or lien on \r\n  real estate.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-104(j).Â  However, nothing in Article 9 \r\n  provides a limitation on the applicability of Article 3 to notes secured by \r\n  mortgages on real estate.\r\nMoreover, the Official Comment to section 36-3-103 \r\n  explains the interaction between Articles 3 and 9.\r\n\r\n2.Â  Instruments which fall within the scope of this Article \r\n  may also be subject to other Articles of the [UCC].Â  Many items in the course \r\n  of bank collection will of course be negotiable instruments, and the same may \r\n  be true of collateral pledged as security for a debt.Â  In such cases this Article, \r\n  which is general, is, in case of conflicting provisions, subject to the \r\n  Article[] which deal[s] specifically with the type of transaction or instrument \r\n  involved: . . . Article 9 (Secured Transactions).Â  In the case of a negotiable \r\n  instrument which is subject to . . . Article 9 because it is collateral, \r\n  the provisions of [Article 3] continue to be applicable except insofar as \r\n  there may be conflicting provisions . . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nReading sections 36-3-103(2) and 36-9-104(j) in conjunction, \r\n  especially in light of the Official Comment to section 36-3-103, we conclude \r\n  Article 3 controls the Note.Â  This interpretation reflects the clear intent \r\n  of the UCC; Article 9 controls over Article 3 only where some conflict between \r\n  the applicable provisions of Articles 3 and 9 exists.Â  Here, no conflict exists \r\n  because Article 9 does not address the underlying indebtedness of a security \r\n  interest.Â  See Midfirst Bank, SSB v. C.W. Haynes &amp; Co., Inc., \r\n  893 F.Supp. 1304, 1312-13 (D.S.C. 1994) (interpreting South Carolina law, holding \r\n  the inapplicability of Article 9 to a negotiable instrument does not affect \r\n  the application of Article 3); First Valley Bank v. First Sav. &amp; Loan \r\n  Assâ€™n of Cent. Indiana, 412 N.E.2d 1237, 1240-41 (Ind. Ct. App. 1980) (rejecting \r\n  the argument â€œthat mortgage notes, which are secured by liens on real estate, \r\n  lie entirely outside the coverage of the [UCC]â€ and adopting the view that Article \r\n  3 applies â€œto promissory notes secured by mortgagesâ€).\r\nWe also conclude the masterâ€™s reliance on South \r\n  Carolina Code Annotated section 29-3-330 (1991), governing the satisfaction \r\n  of real estate mortgages, is misplaced.Â  In his order, the master noted section \r\n  29&#8209;3&#8209;330 requires written satisfaction of a mortgage.Â  The master \r\n  found this language supported his ruling that renunciation of the debt under \r\n  Article 3 of the UCC was not intended by our Legislature to apply to a note \r\n  secured by a real estate mortgage.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 29-3-310 \r\n  (Supp. 2000) states a mortgagee â€œwho has received . . . satisfaction . . \r\n  . of his debts . . . secured by a mortgage on real estate shall . . . enter \r\n  satisfaction . . . on the mortgage.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  This section clearly \r\n  contemplates the satisfaction of a debt, the note, and the satisfaction of the \r\n  security interest for that debt, the mortgage, as separate actions.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to this section, the debtor must first satisfy the note, and then the mortgagee \r\n  must enter satisfaction of the mortgage.Â  Thus, the masterâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  section 29-3-330 supports his ruling with respect to Articles 3 and 9 is incorrect.\r\nIn this case, when Nancy made the Note, she executed \r\n  a document subject to the provisions of Article 3, not Article 9.Â  Her subsequent \r\n  or simultaneous creation of the Mortgage did nothing to change the nature of \r\n  the Note itself.Â  Thus, the Note remained subject to the provisions of Article \r\n  3.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Renunciation of Note\r\nHaving determined the Note is a negotiable instrument \r\n  governed by Article 3 of the UCC, we next address Nancyâ€™s argument that Margaret \r\n  renounced the debt by giving Nancy possession of the original Note.Â  We find \r\n  Nancyâ€™s possession of the original Note gave rise to the presumption that Margaret \r\n  renounced the debt prior to her death.Â  Moreover, the Swindler Family failed \r\n  to produce any evidence to rebut this presumption.Â  Thus, we conclude Nancyâ€™s \r\n  debt was discharged.\r\nAs noted above, section 36-3-605(1) provides: â€œThe \r\n  holder of an instrument may even without consideration discharge any party . \r\n  . . (b) by renouncing his rights . . . by surrender of the instrument to \r\n  be discharged.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  â€œWhen the obligor has possession [of \r\n  the instrument], the party suing on the instrument has to overcome a presumption \r\n  that the instrument was discharged.â€Â  2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. \r\n  Summer, Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 16-13 at 134-35 (4th ed. 1995) (emphasis \r\n  added); see also Winkel v. Erpelding, 526 N.W.2d 316, 319 (Iowa \r\n  1995) (â€œThe debtorâ€™s possession of the instrument creates a rebuttable presumption \r\n  of discharge.â€); Columbia Sav. v. Zelinger, 794 P.2d 231, 234 (Colo. \r\n  1990) (â€œPossession of the instrument by the debtor . . . is normally sufficient \r\n  to create a rebuttable presumption of discharge.â€).Â  Therefore, only if the \r\n  obligee can show the obligor is in possession of the instrument â€œâ€˜unintentionally, \r\n  or under a mistake, or without [] authorityâ€™â€ can the presumption be overcome \r\n  and the discharge proven to be without effect.Â  Peoples Bank of S.C. v. Robinson, \r\n  272 S.C. 155, 158, 249 S.E.2d 784, 785 (1978) (quoting 11 Am. Jur. 2d Bills \r\n  &amp; Notes Â§ 906 (1964)).\r\nAt trial, Nancy testified that prior to Margaretâ€™s \r\n  death, Margaret delivered the original Note to her.Â  Further, Nancy testified \r\n  that she was never informed her possession of the Note was by mistake or that \r\n  she had the Note without authority.Â  Moreover, the Swindler Family admitted \r\n  Nancy has possession of the original Note and provided no evidence or testimony \r\n  to indicate Margaret made a mistake by delivering the Note to Nancy or did not \r\n  intend for Nancy to be discharged from her obligation.\r\nTherefore, we conclude Nancyâ€™s testimony is sufficient \r\n  to create the presumption Margaret intended to discharge Nancy from her obligations \r\n  under the Note.Â  Because the Swindler Family did not produce any evidence or \r\n  argument to the contrary, they have failed to rebut this presumption.Â  Thus, \r\n  we conclude Nancyâ€™s original obligation to pay $200,000.00 for the 54.5-acret \r\n  tract of land is discharged.\r\nCONCLUSION [3] \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the masterâ€™s order finding \r\n  Article 3 of the UCC inapplicable to a note secured by a mortgage on real property \r\n  and ruling Margaret did not renounce her rights in the Note by surrendering \r\n  it to Nancy is reversed and this case is remanded with instructions to enter \r\n  satisfaction of the mortgage in accordance with section 29-3-310.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Much of the statutory authority governing notes and security interests \r\n    has been amended since the inception of this litigation.Â  However, in deciding \r\n    this case we must apply â€œthe law in effect at the time the cause of action \r\n    accrued [because it] controls the partiesâ€™ legal relationships and rights.â€Â  \r\n    Stephens v.

Hodge, Jr., of Darlington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â  Paul Thompson was tried \r\n  in absentia and without counsel.Â  He was convicted of discharging \r\n  a firearm into a dwelling and malicious injury to personal property over $1000 \r\n  but less than $5000.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to five years on each count \r\n  to run concurrently.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nVanessa Pearson was at home with her adult daughter, \r\n  Najwa, on October 30, 1999 when a man named Derrick came to her door and asked \r\n  for â€œJunior.â€Â  Pearson told him that no one by the name of â€œJuniorâ€ lived there.Â  \r\n  Thirty minutes later he came to her door again and asked for â€œJunior.â€Â  She \r\n  reiterated to him that no one by the name of â€œJuniorâ€ lived there.Â  Pearson \r\n  testified that Derrick, Paul Thompson, and Michael Graham then started shooting \r\n  at her car and into her house.Â  The damage to her car was about $4000.Â  Pearson \r\n  identified Peggy Wright as sitting in the backseat of the vehicle that the men \r\n  drove during the occurrence.\r\nGraham, Wright, and Thompson were tried together \r\n  for discharging a firearm into a dwelling and malicious injury to personal property \r\n  over $1000 but less than $5000.Â  The same counsel represented Graham and Wright.Â  \r\n  Thompson was not present nor did he have counsel present.Â  The judge told the \r\n  bailiff to call Thompsonâ€™s name three times at the courthouse door before the \r\n  jury selection began.Â  After Thompson did not respond, he was tried in his absence.Â  \r\n  Graham and Wright presented alibi evidence, which resulted in their acquittals.Â  \r\n  Thompson was found guilty as charged.\r\nA sealed sentence was given as required by law.Â  \r\n  The sealed sentence is NOT opened until the defendant is arrested and \r\n  before the court.Â  After his arrest, Thompson was brought before the court for \r\n  the opening of the sealed sentences.Â  Pursuant to State v. Smith, 276 \r\n  S.C. 494, 280 S.E.2d 200 (1981), the circuit judge opening the sealed sentence \r\n  is under the law the sentencing judge.Â  Exercising his discretion, the judge \r\n  sentenced Thompson to five years on each count, concurrently.\r\nAt sentencing, Thompsonâ€™s attorney professed that \r\n  Thompson appeared at four or five roll calls after his arrest on November 15, \r\n  1999.Â  During that time, Thompson requested through the Clerk of Court representation \r\n  from the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.Â  Thompson contends he was told he did not \r\n  meet the cut-off amount of money to qualify for a public defender.Â  He explained \r\n  to them that he had child support arrearage payments that virtually consumed \r\n  his salary and offered to produce documentation.Â  According to Thompsonâ€™s attorney, \r\n  no one would listen to him regarding his child support payments.Â  The court \r\n  refuted Thompsonâ€™s assertion, explicating that if Thompson had said he did not \r\n  have an attorney, one would have been appointed for him.\r\nA Bench Warrant was issued for Thompson on September \r\n  11, 2000 and another was issued on May 17, 2001.Â  During September 2001, Thompson \r\n  went to a rehabilitation facility in Maryland for cocaine and alcohol addiction.Â  \r\n  He left the facility on November 19, 2001.Â  He went to High Point, North Carolina \r\n  and then to his uncleâ€™s house in Bennettsville.Â  Thompson was tried on November \r\n  28, 2001.Â  Thompsonâ€™s brother testified that the family was only given fourteen \r\n  hours notice of trial.\r\nThe judge determined that a lawyer would have been \r\n  appointed for him if he had presented himself at trial:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â  Well, I can say here for the record if he \r\n  would have been here like the other two defendants were, didnâ€™t have a lawyer, \r\n  we would have appointed one for him.\r\n[THOMPSONâ€™S COUNSEL]:Â  Yes, sir, Your Honor.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  But you canâ€™t appoint one for him if he runs and \r\n  doesnâ€™t even come to court.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThompson argues the judge erred in denying his \r\n  motion for a new trial because he was denied the right to counsel at trial.\r\nI.Â  RIGHT TO COUNSEL\r\nIt is well established that a defendant may be \r\n  tried in his absence.Â  Rule 16, SCRCrimP (â€œExcept in cases wherein capital punishment \r\n  is a permissible sentence, a person indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies \r\n  may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried in his absence \r\n  upon a finding by the court that such person has received notice of his right \r\n  to be present and that a warning was given that the trial would proceed in his \r\n  absence upon a failure to attend the court.â€). \r\n  [2] Â  However, to try a defendant without counsel is a completely different \r\n  matter.Â  Pennsylvania v. Ford, 715 A.2d 1141, 1143 (1998) (citing Gideon \r\n  v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)).\r\nâ€œThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution \r\n  guarantee that a person brought to trial in any state or federal court must \r\n  be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be validly \r\n  convicted and punished by imprisonment.â€ Â Faretta v. California, 422 \r\n  U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 566 (1975); accord \r\n  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 339-40, 83 S.Ct. 792, 794, 9 L.Ed.2d \r\n  799, 802-03 (1963).Â  Moreover, an indigent criminal defendant may request the \r\n  court to appoint an attorney to represent him.Â  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344, \r\n  83 S.Ct. at 796-97, 9 L.Ed.2d at 802; see Scott v. Illinois, 440 \r\n  U.S. 367, 367, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 1159, 59 L.Ed.2d 383, 389 (1979) (â€œThe Sixth and \r\n  Fourteenth Amendments require that no indigent criminal defendant be sentenced \r\n  to a term of imprisonment unless the State has afforded him the right to assistance \r\n  of appointed counsel in his defense . . .â€).\r\nâ€œOf all the rights that an accused person has, \r\n  the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects \r\n  his ability to assert any other rights he may have.â€Â  United States v. Cronic, \r\n  466 U.S. 648, 654, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2044, 80 L.Ed.2d 657, 664 (1984).Â  The erroneous \r\n  deprivation of a defendantâ€™s fundamental right to the assistance of counsel \r\n  is per se reversible error.Â  State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. \r\n  552, 555, 478 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Chapman v. California, \r\n  386 U.S. 18, 23 n.8, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828 n.8, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)).Â  â€œActual \r\n  or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally presumed \r\n  to result in prejudice.â€Â  McKnight v. State, 320 S.C. 356, 358, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  352, 353 (1995) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 692, \r\n  104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 696 (1984)).\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL\r\nA defendant may surrender his right to counsel \r\n  through (1) waiver by affirmative, verbal request; (2) waiver by conduct; and \r\n  (3) forfeiture. Â State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 556, 478 S.E.2d 689, \r\n  690 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWaiver \r\n   \r\nA defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right \r\n  to counsel.Â  A waiver is an intentional and voluntary relinquishment of a known \r\n  right.Â  United States v. Goldberg, 67 F.3d 1092, 1099 (3d Cir. 1995); \r\n  Maxwell v. Genez, 350 S.C. 563, 571, 567 S.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  The courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental \r\n  constitutional rights, and do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental \r\n  rights.Â  Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 \r\n  L.Ed. 1461, 1466 (1938); Pitts v. North Carolina, 395 F.2d 182, 188 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1968).\r\n1. Waiver by Affirmative, Verbal Request\r\nWaiver is most commonly understood as an affirmative, \r\n  verbal request.Â  United States v. Goldberg, 67 F.3d 1092, 1099 (3d Cir. \r\n  1995); State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 556, 478 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996).Â  To effectuate a valid waiver of the right to counsel, the two-pronged \r\n  Faretta test must be met in which the accused is (1) advised of his right \r\n  to counsel and (2) adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation.Â  \r\n  Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 423-24, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990) (citing \r\n  Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975)).Â  \r\n  The trial judge must determine whether there is a knowing and intelligent waiver \r\n  by the defendant.Â  State v. Dixon, 269 S.C. 107, 236 S.E.2d 419 (1977) \r\n  (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 \r\n  (1938)).Â  If the trial judge fails to address the disadvantages of appearing \r\n  pro se, as required by the second prong of Faretta, \r\n  â€œthis Court will look to the record to determine whether petitioner had sufficient \r\n  background or was apprised of his rights by some other source.â€Â  Prince, \r\n  301 S.C. at 424, 392 S.E.2d at 463; accord Wroten v. State, 301 \r\n  S.C. 293, 294, 391 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1990).Â  While a specific inquiry by the \r\n  trial judge expressly addressing the disadvantages of a pro se \r\n  defense is preferred, the ultimate test is not the trial judge's advice but \r\n  rather the defendant's understanding.Â  Gardner v. State, 351 S.C. 407, \r\n  411-12, 570 S.E.2d 184, 186 (2002); Wroten, 301 S.C. at 294, 391 S.E.2d \r\n  at 576.Â  If the record demonstrates the defendant's decision to represent \r\n  himself was made with an understanding of the risks of self-representation, \r\n  the requirements of a voluntary waiver will be satisfied.Â  Id.\r\nPellucidly by his absence, Thompson did not make \r\n  an affirmative, verbal request to waive counsel.\r\n2.Â  Waiver by Conduct\r\nA defendant may waive his right to counsel through \r\n  his conduct.Â  United States v. Goldberg, 67 F.3d 1092, 1100 (3d Cir. \r\n  1995); State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, 128, 245 S.E.2d 606, 608 (1978); \r\n  State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 556, 478 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n  Most courts have held that the defendant must first be warned that his misconduct \r\n  will thereafter be treated as a waiver.Â  Boykin, 324 S.C. at 556, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d at 691.Â  â€œ[T]o the extent that the defendantâ€™s actions are examined under \r\n  the doctrine of â€˜waiver,â€™ there can be no valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment \r\n  right to counsel unless the defendant also receives Faretta warnings.â€Â  \r\n  Goldberg, 67 F.3d at 1100.Â  Any subsequent misconduct will be treated \r\n  as a â€œwaiver by conduct.â€Â  Boykin, 324 S.C. at 556, 478 S.E.2d at 690.\r\nIn State v. Cain, 277 S.C. 210, 284 S.E.2d \r\n  779 (1981), the appellant was tried in absentia and without counsel.Â  \r\n  Cain was represented by counsel at a preliminary hearing and both he and his \r\n  attorney were aware the case was coming up for trial.Â  Id. at 210, 284 \r\n  S.E.2d at 779.Â  The court found Cain was cognizant of his duty to keep in contact \r\n  with his attorney and the court.Â  Id.Â  The court held a waiver of the \r\n  right to counsel was inferable from his omissions.Â  Id. at 211, 284 S.E.2d \r\n  at 779.\r\nAlthough in the present case Thompson was tried \r\n  in absentia and without counsel, the facts in Cain are \r\n  quite different.Â  Unlike Thompson, Cain was represented by counsel at a preliminary \r\n  hearing.Â  Cain edifies:\r\n\r\nThe appellant was released on a general appearance bond and \r\n  was represented by counsel at a preliminary hearing.Â  Both the appellant and \r\n  his attorney knew the case was coming up for trial. The appellant knew he had \r\n  a duty to stay in touch with his attorney and with the court.\r\nWe held in State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, 245 S.E.2d \r\n  606 (1978) that a waiver of the right to counsel can be inferred from a defendant's \r\n  actions. In this case, the appellant failed to fulfill the conditions of his \r\n  appearance bond and neglected to keep contact with his attorney, although he \r\n  knew his trial was imminent. We think a waiver of the right to counsel is inferrable \r\n  [sic] from these omissions.\r\n\r\nId. at 210-11, 284 S.E.2d at 779 (footnote \r\n  omitted).\r\nThe case of State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, \r\n  245 S.E.2d 606 (1978), analyzes a trial scenario where the appellant participated \r\n  at trial, but did not have counsel.Â  The appellant was not indigent.Â Â  The trial \r\n  judge urged him on several occasions to retain a lawyer.Â  The case was continued \r\n  at least once to enable the appellant to hire an attorney.Â  Id. at 127, \r\n  245 S.E.2d at 607.Â  The judge asked an attorney with the Public Defenderâ€™s Office \r\n  to sit with him at trial to offer him advice and assistance.Â  Id.Â  Although \r\n  the appellant never expressly waived his right to counsel, the court held the \r\n  appellant waived his right to counsel by his conduct because he was given reasonable \r\n  time to secure counsel, he was financially capable of retaining counsel, and \r\n  the court had done all it could to advise him to seek counsel.Â  Id.\r\nThe facts in Jacobs are dissimilar to the \r\n  case sub judice.Â  Jacobs was present in the courtroom, he was \r\n  financially capable of retaining counsel, the judge had repeatedly encouraged \r\n  him to get an attorney, the judge continued the case at least on one occasion \r\n  for him to retain an attorney, and he had the assistance of a public defender \r\n  at trial.Â  Jacobs is enlightening:\r\n\r\nAppellant never expressly waived his right to counsel but \r\n  the trial judge found that he was very capable of retaining counsel, that the \r\n  court had done all it could do to urge him to do so, and that he had still not \r\n  employed a lawyer. The trial judge asked an attorney from the Public Defender's \r\n  Office to sit with him during his trial to give him advice and assistance. The \r\n  attorney advised the court that he was totally unprepared for trial but the \r\n  trial judge said that appellant's inaction had caused the situation. Appellant \r\n  agreed to allow the attorney to sit with him but indicated that he wanted him \r\n  to do nothing further in the case. The trial then proceeded.\r\n. . . .\r\nOn the facts of this case, we feel that the trial judge allowed \r\n  appellant, a non-indigent, a reasonable time in which to retain counsel and \r\n  that appellant did not make a sufficient showing of reasons for his failure \r\n  to have counsel present. He was on several occasions urged to retain counsel \r\n  and a phone was made available to him and additional time was given him in order \r\n  for him to make arrangements. When, on the day of trial, counsel was not present, \r\n  appellant did not name his attorney, if one had been retained, nor did he indicate \r\n  when counsel would be available. He gave no reasons for the absence of counsel \r\n  other than that he had been expecting his brother to bring a lawyer.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that, by his conduct, appellant waived his right \r\n  to counsel.\r\nId. at 127-28, 245 S.E.2d at 607-08.\r\nAn excellent academic explication of an appellant \r\n  tried in absentia and without representation is Pennsylvania \r\n  v. Ford, 715 A.2d 1141 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1998).Â  The appellant was originally \r\n  appointed counsel.Â  Id. at 1143.Â  He requested a continuance in order \r\n  to find private counsel.Â  Id.Â  The court then approved the withdrawal \r\n  of the court-appointed counsel.Â  Id.Â  Two weeks before jury selection \r\n  was initiated, the appellant fled the jurisdiction after violating his probation \r\n  in a prior unrelated case.Â  Id.Â  When the appellant did not appear for \r\n  jury selection, his private counsel filed a motion to withdraw, arguing that \r\n  the appellant had not paid a large portion of his fee and his absence impeded \r\n  trial preparation.Â  Id.Â  The court granted the motion and proceeded to \r\n  try the appellant in absentia and without counsel.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The court found the appellant did not validly waive his right to counsel because \r\n  there was no inquiry on the record as to whether the appellant was aware of \r\n  his rights or whether he knowingly waived them.Â  Id. at 1144.Â  The court \r\n  observed that this type of inquiry is â€œquite obviously impossibleâ€ when a defendant \r\n  fails to appear in court.Â  Id.Â  However, the court ruled that â€œ[f]ailure \r\n  to appear . . . is not tantamount to a knowing waiver.â€Â  Id.Â  The appellantâ€™s \r\n  fugitive status was not a per se waiver nor could it be punished \r\n  by the â€œnegation of constitutional rights.â€Â  Id.Â  His fugitive status \r\n  was a separate wrong with its own consequences.Â  Id.\r\nWhile Thompson did not have counsel withdraw at \r\n  the brink of trial, he similarly was not queried on the record as to whether \r\n  he was aware of his rights or whether he knowingly waived them.Â  The Ford \r\n  court acknowledged the impracticability of asking the defendant on the record \r\n  when he does not appear in court, but still found that a failure to appear does \r\n  not equate a knowing waiver.Â  Likewise, Thompsonâ€™s failure to appear does NOT \r\n  rise to the level of waiver.\r\nThe Indiana Court of Appeals thoroughly analyzed \r\n  a trial in absentia involving a defendant unrepresented by counsel.Â  \r\n  Slayton v. Indiana, 755 N.E.2d 232 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001).Â  Slayton appeared \r\n  in court three times before trial in which the court mentioned counsel but never \r\n  advised him of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.Â  Id. \r\n  at 234.Â  The State argued that Slayton never requested the court to appoint \r\n  counsel and that his failing to appear at trial â€œprevented the trial court from \r\n  providing him with counsel or from even determining his intention to have counsel.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 235.Â  Hence, the State maintained Slayton waived his right because \r\n  he never clearly exercised it one way or another.Â  Id.Â  The court found \r\n  the Stateâ€™s argument was flawed.Â  First, the court determined that Slayton wanted \r\n  â€œstandbyâ€ counsel.Â  Id. at 236.Â  Next, the court acknowledged the failure \r\n  to advise Slayton of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation relating \r\n  to the Faretta two-prong test.Â  Id.Â  Finally, the court recognized \r\n  the presumption against a waiver of the right to counsel.Â  Id.Â  The court \r\n  ruled â€œ[t]he Stateâ€™s argument for â€˜waiverâ€™ would turn this presumption on its \r\n  head, requiring a defendant to clearly exercise rights that were never explained \r\n  to him.â€Â  Id.Â  Based upon the record being void of any implication that \r\n  Slayton understood the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, the \r\n  court held the facts and circumstances of the case did not warrant a finding \r\n  of a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel.Â  Id.\r\nThe case at bar is most similar to the facts in \r\n  Slayton.Â  Both defendants were tried in absentia, unrepresented \r\n  by counsel, and had appeared in court several times before trial.Â  Neither of \r\n  the defendants was advised of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation \r\n  under Faretta.Â  Furthermore, the record in the instant case does not \r\n  reveal any inference that Thompson understood the dangers and disadvantages \r\n  of self-representation.Â  Thompson did not have a prior record which would have \r\n  familiarized him with the criminal court system.Â  Abiding by the presumption \r\n  against a waiver of the right to counsel, we conclude Thompson did not waive \r\n  his right to counsel through his conduct when he never was apprised of his right \r\n  nor the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nForfeiture \r\n   \r\nSome courts recognize forfeiture as a means to \r\n  waive the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  A defendant can forfeit his right \r\n  to counsel irrespective of his knowledge of either the consequences of his actions \r\n  or the dangers of self-representation.Â  United States v. Goldberg, 67 \r\n  F.3d 1092, 1100 (3d. Cir. 1995).Â  â€œ[B]ecause of the drastic nature of the sanction, \r\n  forfeiture would appear to require extremely dilatory conduct.Â  On the other \r\n  hand, a 'waiver by conduct' could be based on conduct less severe than that \r\n  sufficient to warrant a forfeiture.â€Â  Id. at 1101.Â  Situations where \r\n  a defendantâ€™s own conduct forfeits his right to counsel are unusual, typically \r\n  involving a manipulative or disruptive defendant.Â  State v. Coleman, \r\n  644 N.W.2d 283, 288 (Wis. Ct. App. 2002). \r\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in United \r\n  States v. McLeod identified methods in which a defendant could forfeit counsel:\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel, for example, may be \r\n  forfeited by a defendantâ€™s failure to retain counsel within a reasonable time, \r\n  even if this forfeiture causes the defendant to proceed pro se.Â  \r\n  See Fowler, 605 F.2d at 183.Â  Additionally, a defendant who misbehaves \r\n  in the courtroom may forfeit his constitutional right to be present at trial.Â  \r\n  See e.g., Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, \r\n  25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970); Foster v. Wainwright, 686 F.2d 1382, 1388-89 (11th \r\n  Cir. 1982), cert. denied 459 U.S. 1213, 103 S.Ct. 1209, 75 L.Ed.2d \r\n  449 (1983).Â  A defendant who causes a witness to be unavailable for trial forfeits \r\n  his right to confrontation.Â  See United States v. Thevis, 665 \r\n  F.2d 616, 630 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), cert. denied, \r\n  459 U.S. 825, 103 S.Ct. 57, 74 L.Ed.2d 61 (1982).Â  A defendant who escapes from \r\n  custody during his trial waives his Sixth Amendment rights to be present and \r\n  to confront witnesses during the trial.Â  See Golden v. Newsome, \r\n  755 F.2d 1478, 1481 (11th Cir. 1985).\r\nBy analogy, we conclude that under certain circumstances, \r\n  a defendant who is abusive toward his attorney may forfeit his right to counsel.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n53 F.3d 322, 325 (11th Cir. 1995) (footnotes \r\n  omitted).Â  McLeod had verbally abused and threatened to harm counsel in a telephone \r\n  conversation, at least four times had threatened to sue him, and had attempted \r\n  to persuade counsel to engage in unethical conduct.Â  Id. at 325.Â  His \r\n  behavior was â€œrepeatedly abusive, threatening, and coercive.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  326.Â  Consequently, McLeod forfeited his right to counsel.Â  \r\nMisconduct by a defendant directed toward counsel \r\n  is the quiddity of State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 478 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  Boykin verbally abused and physically threatened defense counsel.Â  \r\n  The judge granted the request of counsel to be relieved.Â  Id. at 554-55, \r\n  478 S.E.2d at 689-90.Â  Boykin elucidates:\r\n\r\nAlthough we do not condone Boykin's actions, we do not believe \r\n  they were so severe as to permanently deprive him of appointed counsel. Both \r\n  cases which have held a defendant forfeited his right to counsel involved a \r\n  course of conduct more egregious than the single incident alleged here. Accordingly, \r\n  we need not decide whether South Carolina should embrace the doctrine of forfeiture \r\n  because we find that Boykin's conduct in the one event related by Padgett was \r\n  not sufficient to constitute forfeiture.Â  While the trial judge was certainly \r\n  justified in granting Padgett's motion to be relieved as counsel, substitute \r\n  counsel should have been appointed for Boykin. Therefore, the decision of the \r\n  trial court is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\r\n\r\nWe decline to place our imprimatur upon Thompsonâ€™s \r\n  conduct or absence.Â  Our declination of approval of Thompsonâ€™s activities does \r\n  NOT mandate forfeiture of counsel.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nForfeiture of counsel is a drastic consequence, \r\n  requiring more than absence from trial.Â  We rule Thompson did NOT relinquish \r\n  his right to counsel through forfeiture.Â  \r\nBased on the record in its entirety, we hold Thompson \r\n  did NOT waive his right to counsel.\r\nHe was erroneously deprived of his fundamental \r\n  right to assistance of counsel.Â  This denial is per se reversible \r\n  error.Â  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  This case was decided without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Thompsonâ€™s waiver of his right to be present at \r\n    trial is not at issue on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3660","title":"Venture Engineering, Inc. v.

(â€œVentureâ€) appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order, finding Ventureâ€™s mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien did not encumber property owned by the South Carolina Public Service Authority \r\n  (â€œSantee Cooperâ€).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1995, Timberland Properties, Inc. (â€œTimberlandâ€) \r\n  purchased approximately 422 acres of real property owned by the State of South \r\n  Carolina but managed by Santee Cooper.Â  As part of the sale, Timberland agreed \r\n  to begin construction of a â€œtheme parkâ€ within 12 months from the date of the \r\n  purchase.Â  This provision was later amended, extending the time limit by 90 \r\n  days.Â  If Timberland failed to begin construction within the prescribed period, \r\n  Santee Cooper had the right to repurchase the property together with all improvements \r\n  for the original sale price.Â  The original deed and contract, along with the \r\n  subsequent amendment were properly recorded in the Horry County Register of \r\n  Deeds.\r\nSubsequently, Timberland hired Venture to perform \r\n  civil engineering services in connection with Timberlandâ€™s development of the \r\n  property.Â  However, Timberland failed to pay for Ventureâ€™s services, and Venture \r\n  filed a mechanicâ€™s lien on the property for $127,786.74 on May 6, 1997.Â  In \r\n  addition, Timberland failed to begin construction on the theme park as required \r\n  by its contract with Santee Cooper, and Santee Cooper repurchased the property \r\n  on May 16, 1997.\r\nIn June 1997, Timberland sought Bankruptcy protection \r\n  under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Several months later, Venture sought \r\n  to foreclose on its mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  In February 1999, the Bankruptcy Court \r\n  issued a Notice of Settlement and Sale, in which it advised all Timberland creditors \r\n  that Timberlandâ€™s bankruptcy trustee intended to submit a proposed settlement \r\n  to the Bankruptcy Court for its approval.Â  Among other things, the proposed \r\n  settlement indicated the trustee would sell the property to Santee Cooper free \r\n  and clear of all liens and encumbrances.Â  In addition, the notice indicated \r\n  any party objecting to the proposed settlement had to submit a written objection \r\n  within twenty days, pursuant to Rule 9014, District of South Carolina Bankruptcy \r\n  Rules.Â  Venture received a copy of the notice, but did not file any objection.\r\nSubsequently, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Approval \r\n  Order, approving the proposed settlement and sale.Â  The property was then transferred \r\n  to Santee Cooper, â€œfree and clear of all liens and encumbrances in accordance \r\n  with 11 U.S.C. Â§ 363.â€\r\nFollowing the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings, \r\n  Ventureâ€™s foreclosure action was referred to a master.Â  The master dismissed \r\n  Ventureâ€™s claim with prejudice, finding Ventureâ€™s claim was barred because Venture \r\n  failed to object to the sale of the property by the bankruptcy trustee free \r\n  and clear of all liens and encumbrances.Â  Venture appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAmong other things, Venture argues the master erred \r\n  in finding its claim was barred because it failed to object in Bankruptcy Court \r\n  to the proposed settlement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe United States Bankruptcy Code provides, in \r\n  relevant part: â€œ(b)(1) The trustee, after notice and a hearing, may . . . sell \r\n  . . . property of the [bankruptcy] estate . . . (f) free and clear of any interest \r\n  in such property of an entity . . . if . . . (2) such entity consents . . . \r\n  .â€Â  11 U.S.C. Â§ 363 (1999); see also In re Collins, 180 B.R. 447, \r\n  450 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995).Â  South Carolinaâ€™s local bankruptcy rules provide \r\n  the specific notice procedures the trustee must follow before the trustee may \r\n  sell the property.Â  SC LBR 6004-1(b) states: â€œMotions to sell property free \r\n  and clear of liens pursuant to . . . 11 U.S.C. Â§ 363 must be made using the \r\n  passive notice procedure prescribed by SC LBR 9014-2 . . . and must be served \r\n  on all parties in interest.â€Â  See SC LBR 9014&#8209;2 (stating, when \r\n  giving notice of a proposed settlement and sale, parties must adhere to South \r\n  Carolinaâ€™s local clerkâ€™s instructions).\r\nThe local clerkâ€™s instructions provide, in relevant \r\n  part, â€œthe moving party must serve on . . . any other interested party . . . \r\n  (1) The motion; (2) The notice of hearing of the motion; [and] (3) A proposed \r\n  order . . . .â€Â  SC CI 9014-2(b).Â  Furthermore, SC CI 9014-2(c) provides â€œAny \r\n  response, return and/or objection to the motion must be served no later \r\n  than twenty (20) days following the service date of the motion . . . .Â  (2)Â  \r\n  If the objection time expires without the filing of an [sic] response, return \r\n  and/or objection or other request, the proposed order will be promptly submitted \r\n  to the judge for his consideration.â€ (Emphasis added); cf. In \r\n  re Parrish, 171 B.R. 138, 140 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1994) (indicating a hearing \r\n  need only be held when, after having received notice, a creditor objects to \r\n  the proposed settlement).\r\nVenture received notice pursuant to the rules and \r\n  clerkâ€™s instruction noted above and was given an opportunity to object within \r\n  twenty days.Â  Venture did not object, but argues on appeal it was not required \r\n  to do so.Â  Venture bases this argument on its misplaced belief that because \r\n  both the bankruptcy trustee and Santee Cooper claimed title to the same property, \r\n  Venture was not required to make its claim until after the Bankruptcy Court \r\n  determined which entity owned the property.\r\nHowever, a bankruptcy trustee â€œhas the rights and \r\n  powers of a hypothetical creditor possessing a judicial lien which attaches \r\n  upon commencement of the case; the law treats a trustee as a hypothetical lien \r\n  creditor.Â  See 11 U.S.C. Â§ 544.â€Â  In re Parrish, 171 B.R. at 141 \r\n  (internal quotations omitted).Â  Once Timberland filed for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy \r\n  trustee took a judicial lien on the property.Â  Thus, notwithstanding the adversarial \r\n  position taken by Santee Cooper, the property remained subject to the trusteeâ€™s \r\n  judicially created lien until the date of the sale.Â  See id. (holding \r\n  â€œ[o]nce the property is sold and relinquished by the Trustee, the property ceases \r\n  to belong to the estate, and the Trusteeâ€™s fictional hypothetical lien terminates \r\n  on the date of saleâ€).Â  As such, we find Venture was required to timely object \r\n  to the trusteeâ€™s Notice of Proposed Settlement and Sale if it wished to protect \r\n  its interest in the property itself or the proceeds of the sale of the property.\r\nHaving failed to object to the sale, Venture consented \r\n  to having its lien extinguished.Â  See FutureSource, LLC v. Reuters \r\n  Ltd., 312 F.3d 281, 284 (7th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. \r\n  1769 (2003) (holding, although Futuresource was not a party to the bankruptcy \r\n  proceeding, it was a party in interest, and thus, it had a right to raise and \r\n  appear to be heard on any issue in the case.Â  Moreover, â€œit was notified of \r\n  [the sale and the purchase agreement] and had access to a copy of the agreement \r\n  yet it did not object to the sale or challenge the bankruptcy courtâ€™s order.â€); \r\n  see also In re Elliot, 94 B.R. 343 (E.D. Pa. 1988) (holding section \r\n  363(f)(2) permitted the bankruptcy trustee â€œto sell the property free and clear \r\n  of all liens because [the creditor] consented to the sale . . . by failing to \r\n  make any timely objection after receiving notice of the saleâ€).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find the master did not err in dismissing Ventureâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure \r\n  action.\r\nCONCLUSION [1] \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the masterâ€™s order dismissing \r\n  Ventureâ€™s claim with prejudice is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, J., and BEATTY, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because of our holding with respect to Ventureâ€™s failure to object \r\n    to the proposed settlement, we need not reach Ventureâ€™s other issues on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3661","title":"Neely v.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3661\r\nHeard April 10, 2003 â€“ Filed July 14, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nVACATED IN PART and\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCarolyn W. Rogers, of Rock Hill, for Respondents.\r\nS. Jackson Kimball, III, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTROM, Acting Judge:Â  Nancy Thomasson appeals \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the probate courtâ€™s order, which determined \r\n  Thomasson was not a child of John Thomas Neely, and therefore, not an heir of \r\n  his estate.Â  We vacate in part and reverse and remand in part.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThomasson was born on December 1, 1943.Â  Her birth \r\n  certificate lists her name as Nancy Jane Neely and her parents as John Thomas \r\n  Neely and Josephine Morgan.Â  Thomassonâ€™s parents, unmarried at the time of her \r\n  birth, married seven months later.Â  They separated approximately six months \r\n  after their marriage, but did not immediately seek a divorce.\r\nIn 1963, Morgan brought an action, seeking a divorce \r\n  from Neely.Â  She alleged one child was born to her and Neely.Â  Neely never answered \r\n  Morganâ€™s Complaint and was held in default.Â  The matter was referred to a special \r\n  master, who was to conduct a hearing, take evidence, and issue a report to the \r\n  circuit court, which would then enter a final order.Â  Pursuant to the order \r\n  of reference, the special referee issued a report in which he stated the evidence \r\n  adduced during the hearing proved one child was born to the parties and the \r\n  child was emancipated at the time of the hearing.Â  This finding was incorporated \r\n  by the circuit court in its final order granting Morgan a divorce.Â  Neither \r\n  party appealed this final decree.\r\nIn 1998, Neely died intestate.Â  Subsequently, Thomasson \r\n  asserted a claim in probate court, alleging she was Neelyâ€™s daughter, and therefore, \r\n  an heir to his estate.Â  Thomasson was appointed as the estateâ€™s personal representative.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, Neelyâ€™s brother and sister, Lyle Neely and Rita Russell (collectively, \r\n  â€œNeelyâ€™s Siblingsâ€), commenced this action, alleging Thomasson was not Neelyâ€™s \r\n  child and seeking judicial determination of Neelyâ€™s heirs. \r\n  [1] \r\nDuring the contested proceeding, the probate court \r\n  admitted blood-type evidence, indicating Thomasson had a blood type that could \r\n  not have been produced from the blood types of Neely and Morgan.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the probate court admitted DNA evidence, showing a 0.00% probability Thomasson \r\n  was Neelyâ€™s daughter.\r\nFollowing the hearing, the probate court found Thomasson \r\n  was neither Neelyâ€™s natural nor adopted child and no adjudication of paternity \r\n  occurred prior to Neelyâ€™s death.Â  Thus, the probate court ruled Thomasson was \r\n  not Neelyâ€™s heir for purposes of intestate succession.Â  Thomasson appealed the \r\n  probate courtâ€™s order to the circuit court, which affirmed the order.Â  Thomasson \r\n  appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nFor the first time, Thomasson argues the probate \r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue of paternity.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Thomasson argues this Court should vacate the probate courtâ€™s entire \r\n  order.Â  We agree the probate court did not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to adjudicate the issue of paternity.Â  However, we do not agree this Court must \r\n  vacate the entire order.\r\nInitially we note, our rules of error preservation \r\n  do not bar Thomassonâ€™s argument because she asserts a defect in the probate \r\n  courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See Tatnall v. Gardner, \r\n  350 S.C. 135, 137, 564 S.E.2d 377, 378 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œThe issue of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time including when raised for the \r\n  first time on appeal to this Court.â€).\r\nOur Court recently decided an almost identical case \r\n  in Simmons v. Bellamy, 349 S.C. 473, 562 S.E.2d 687 (Ct. App. 2002) (per \r\n  curiam).Â  We find Simmons controlling in the current situation.Â  In Simmons, \r\n  the probate court, relying on its jurisdiction to determine heirs during an \r\n  intestacy proceeding, issued an order in which it determined an infant born \r\n  after the decedentâ€™s death was the child of the decedent, and thus, his heir.Â  \r\n  349 S.C. at 475, 562 S.E.2d at 688.Â  The circuit court affirmed the probate \r\n  courtâ€™s order in its entirety.Â  Id.Â  This Court sua sponte raised \r\n  the issue of whether the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate \r\n  paternity and held it did not.Â  Id. at 476-77, 562 S.E.2d at 689.\r\nWhen rendering its decision, the Simmons court \r\n  considered the jurisdiction of both the family court and the probate court.Â  \r\n  This Court specifically considered whether the probate court could adjudicate \r\n  paternity as part of its inherent jurisdiction to determine heirs during an \r\n  intestacy proceeding.Â  However, after reviewing the applicable statutory authority, \r\n  specifically South Carolina Code Annotated section 20-7-420 (1976) (stating \r\n  â€œ[t]he family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction: . . . (7) To hear and \r\n  determine actions to determine the paternity of an individualâ€), this Court \r\n  unequivocally found the family court is vested with exclusive subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to adjudicate matters of paternity even when the question of a \r\n  decedentâ€™s heirs is properly pending before the probate court.Â  Simmons, \r\n  349 S.C. at 476-77, 562 S.E.2d at 689.\r\nWe find both the reasoning and result reached in Simmons \r\n  to be compelling.Â  The probate courtâ€™s jurisdiction extends to all matters â€œrelated \r\n  to . . . [the] determination of heirsâ€ â€œexcept as otherwise specifically provided.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a) (Supp. 2002).Â  However, section 20-7-420(7) of \r\n  the Childrenâ€™s Code reserves to the family court exclusive jurisdiction for \r\n  the adjudication of paternity.Â  Therefore, we find the probate courtâ€™s jurisdiction \r\n  is limited by section 20-7-420(7).Â  Moreover, section 20&#8209;7&#8209;420(7) \r\n  expressly provides the family court is to adjudicate paternity in intestacy \r\n  cases that have already been or will be commenced in probate court.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(7) (stating â€œ[t]he [paternity] action may be brought \r\n  . . . , if the father is deceased, in the county in which proceedings for probate \r\n  of his estate have been or could be commencedâ€).\r\nThus, having reviewed the applicable statutory authority \r\n  and relevant case law, we see no reason for this Court to depart from our decision \r\n  in Simmons.Â  However, although we agree with Thomassonâ€™s contention that \r\n  the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine her paternity, \r\n  we do not agree we must vacate the probate courtâ€™s entire order.Â  As \r\n  noted above, the probate court has jurisdiction to determine heirs in an intestacy \r\n  proceeding.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(i).Â  Thus, we find it necessary \r\n  to vacate only that portion of the probate courtâ€™s order in which it purported \r\n  to adjudicate Thomassonâ€™s paternity.\r\nII. Prior Adjudication of Paternity\r\nHaving determined the probate court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Thomassonâ€™s paternity, we must next decide \r\n  whether the court erred in finding the Neely-Morgan divorce decree was not a \r\n  final adjudication of Thomassonâ€™s paternity.\r\nIn relevant part, South Carolina Code Annotated section \r\n  62-2-109 (Supp. 2002) states â€œ[i]f . . . a relationship of parent and child \r\n  must be established to determine succession . . . (2)(ii) the paternity is established \r\n  by an adjudication commenced before the death of the father.â€Â  Thus, we must \r\n  determine whether the Neely-Morgan divorce decree, clearly issued prior to Neelyâ€™s \r\n  death, was a final adjudication of Thomassonâ€™s paternity.\r\n\r\nâ€œAny judgment or decree, leaving some further act to \r\n  be done by the court before the rights of the parties are determined [is not \r\n  final]; but if it so completely fixes the rights of the parties that the \r\n  court has nothing further to do in the action, then it is final.â€\r\n\r\nAdickes v. Allison &amp; Bratton, 21 S.C. 245, \r\n  259 (1884) (alteration and emphasis added) (quoting Freeman Judgments \r\n  Â§ 12), cited with approval in Mid-State Distribs., Inc. v. Century \r\n  Imports, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 335, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993).Â  A decree \r\n  of divorce is generally a final judgment of the court.Â  Culbertson v.

App. 2002) (â€œThe final written \r\n  order contains the binding instructions which are to be followed by the parties.â€).\r\nForty years ago, Morgan brought an action against \r\n  Neely.Â  Morgan sought a divorce and asserted Thomasson was the partiesâ€™ only \r\n  child.Â  Neely never answered Morganâ€™s Complaint and was held in default.Â  The \r\n  matter was referred to a special master, who conducted a hearing, took evidence, \r\n  and issued a report to the circuit court.Â  In the special refereeâ€™s report, \r\n  he stated the evidence adduced during the hearing proved one child was born \r\n  to the parties and the child was emancipated at the time of the hearing.Â  This \r\n  finding was incorporated by the circuit court in its final order granting Morgan \r\n  a divorce.Â  Neither party appealed.\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed the record, including the original \r\n  documents involved in the Neely-Morgan divorce action, we find the probate court \r\n  erred in concluding the divorce decree was not a final adjudication of Thomassonâ€™s \r\n  paternity.Â  Morgan alleged Thomasson was Neelyâ€™s child and Neely did not respond.Â  \r\n  Neely had the opportunity to contest Thomassonâ€™s paternity at the hearing and \r\n  did not do so.Â  This Court need not speculate why Neely did not contest Thomassonâ€™s \r\n  paternity during the divorce proceedings, but rather must only confirm Neely \r\n  was given the opportunity to do so.Â  Cf. Sub-zero Freezer Co. v. R.J. \r\n  Clarkson Co., 308 S.C. 188, 191, 417 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1992) (indicating \r\n  by analogy, â€œclaims [that] were either litigat[ed] in the prior actions or could \r\n  have been so litigatedâ€ may not be relitigated in a subsequent action).&nbsp;\r\nIn this case, the courtâ€™s order, granting Morgan a \r\n  divorce and finding the parties had one child, clearly â€œdisposed of every issue \r\n  in the case, directed judgmentâ€ and contained binding instructions for the parties.Â  \r\n  See Adickes, 21 S.C. at 259; Corbin, 351 S.C. at 621, 571 \r\n  S.E.2d at 97.Â  Because Neely never appealed the final decree it is the law of \r\n  the case and cannot now be challenged or ignored.Â  See  ML-Lee \r\n  Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of the case \r\n  and cannot be later challenged).Â  Thus, we find the divorce decree was a final \r\n  adjudication of Thomassonâ€™s paternity prior to Nellyâ€™s death as contemplated \r\n  by section 62&#8209;2-109(2)(ii).\r\nWe believe our holding supports the important public \r\n  policy interest of upholding the finality of judgments rendered by the courts \r\n  of this State, particularly when those judgments involve issues relating to \r\n  children.Â  Cf. Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., Op. No. 25627 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed Apr. 14, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 51, 63) (stating \r\n  South Carolina courts have long â€œrecognize[d] that important benefits are achieved \r\n  by the preservation of final judgmentsâ€).Â  Were we to hold otherwise, we would \r\n  be permitting Neelyâ€™s Siblings to assert challenges to Thomassonâ€™s paternity \r\n  that Neely chose not to assert.\r\nThus, because we find the divorce decree was a \r\n  final adjudication of Thomassonâ€™s paternity, we find the probate court erred \r\n  further in its determination of Neelyâ€™s heirs.Â  Therefore, based on our holding \r\n  that Thomasson is Neelyâ€™s child for purposes of intestacy proceedings, we remand \r\n  the case for the probate court to redetermine the heirs of Neelyâ€™s estate and \r\n  redistribute his estate in accordance with this opinion.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n [2] \r\nBecause the probate court did not have subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to adjudicate Thomassonâ€™s paternity and erred in deciding the Neely-Morgan \r\n  divorce decree was not a final adjudication of Thomassonâ€™s paternity, the probate \r\n  courtâ€™s order is\r\nVACATED IN PART and REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs.\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate \r\n  opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  (concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part):Â  I agree fully with the majorityâ€™s discussion and conclusion regarding \r\n  Issue I, the subject matter jurisdiction of the probate court to determine paternity.Â  \r\n  However, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s view on Issue II and respectfully dissent \r\n  therefrom.\r\nAlthough neither res judicata nor claim or issue \r\n  preclusion is strictly involved here because of the intervention of the statute, \r\n  much of the same analysis that would be required under those doctrines should \r\n  be utilized here.Â  See generally Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, \r\n  328 S.C. 201, 216-17, 493 S.E.2d 826, 834-35 (1997).Â  There is, however, one \r\n  significant difference.Â  The statute requires an adjudication of paternity, \r\n  not merely an opportunity for an adjudication.Â  In the final analysis, I do \r\n  not believe the divorce decree constituted an adjudication of paternity within \r\n  the contemplation of the statute.Â  \r\nA review of the divorce proceeding is revealing.Â  \r\n  The action was commenced by a complaint containing six brief factual paragraphs \r\n  together with two even more brief paragraphs setting forth the relief requested.Â  \r\n  The only factual paragraph related to paternity alleged that to the union one \r\n  child, Nancy Jane Neely Wells, was born â€œwho is now married and no longer dependent \r\n  on the plaintiff for support.â€Â  No relief was requested of the court relating \r\n  to this child, the prayer being limited to a divorce and â€œany other and further \r\n  relief as to the court may seem just and proper.â€Â  The defendant, John Thomas \r\n  Neely, defaulted.Â  A reference was held before a special referee.Â  In the minutes \r\n  of the reference, one question was asked about the child, as follows:Â  \r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I believe there was one child born \r\n  to this union and that child is now grown and married?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir.\r\nThat is the sum and substance of the testimony as \r\n  to paternity.Â  The referee then issued his report, which contains only one sentence \r\n  related to the child:Â  â€œThe evidence further showed that the parties to this \r\n  action are the parents of one child, who is now grown and married, and that \r\n  since this child is now married, there is no question of custody or support.â€Â  \r\n  None of the findings and recommendations by the special referee relate to the \r\n  child or the question of paternity.Â  There followed a perfunctory decree of \r\n  the court adopting in full the recommendations of the special referee and awarding \r\n  the plaintiff a divorce, without even mentioning the existence of a child.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is clear \r\n  that this action established only that the parties were entitled to a divorce \r\n  from one another.Â  However, the issue of the paternity of the child was not \r\n  necessary to that conclusion.Â  Paternity was never actually litigated, nor did \r\n  it have to be.\r\nI would, therefore, affirm the probate \r\n  court on this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  During the course of these proceedings, Rita Russell died, but her \r\n    estateâ€™s personal representative has continued in the same posture on her \r\n    behalf.Â  Thus, the parties to the action remain the same and this change does \r\n    not affect the outcome of the case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Because of our holdings with respect to the probate courtâ€™s lack \r\n    of subject matter jurisdiction and error in determining the Neely-Morgan divorce \r\n    decree was not a prior adjudication of paternity, we need not reach Thomassonâ€™s \r\n    other issues on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3596","title":"Collins Entertainment v.

Quinn, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nStephen L. Brown, Edward D. Buckley, \r\n  Jr., Donald J. Davis, Jr. and Stephen P. Groves, Sr., all of Charleston, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:&nbsp;&nbsp; Collins \r\n  Entertainment Corp. (Collins) brought this action against (1) Coats and Coats \r\n  Rental Amusement, d/b/a Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo, (2) Wayne Coats, \r\n  individually, and (3) American Bingo &amp; Gaming Corp. (ABG), alleging various \r\n  causes of action arising out of ABGâ€™s removal of Collinsâ€™ coin machines from \r\n  Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo.Â  The case was referred to the Charleston \r\n  County master-in-equity for trial with authority to enter a final judgment.Â  \r\n  ABG appeals (1) the masterâ€™s finding that it intentionally interfered in a lease \r\n  for the placement of Collinsâ€™ video poker machines in the two business establishments \r\n  and (2) the punitive damages award.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nT.A. Coats and his wife Darlene owned \r\n  or operated a business known as Coats and Coats Rental Amusement.Â  Wayne \r\n  Coats, their son, also appears to have been involved in the business.Â \r\nCoats and Coats Rental Amusement operated two bingo \r\n  halls, Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo, at two different locations.Â  \r\n  The locations had been procured by T.A. Coats subject to written real estate \r\n  leases between him and the individual property owners.\r\nOn March 28, 1996, Collins entered \r\n  into a six-year lease agreement with â€œCoats and Coats Rental Amusements d/b/a \r\n  Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo and Wayne Coats, individuallyâ€ for \r\n  the exclusive right to lease video poker machines at both locations.Â  The \r\n  parties were to split the revenues from operating the machines.Â  The \r\n  agreement further provided that, if the premises were sold, the buyer was to \r\n  assume the lease.Â  Wayne Coats signed the agreement individually and \r\n  on behalf of Coats and Coats Rental Amusement.\r\nIn 1997, ABG entered into negotiations \r\n  with T.A. Coats to purchase the assets of the Ponderosa and Shipwatch businesses \r\n  and to assume the ground leases to the properties on which they operated.Â  \r\n  The purchase and sale agreement required Coats and Coats to indemnify ABG \r\n  in the event ABG was sued for interfering with the video poker machine contract.Â  \r\n  Although T.A. Coats made ABG aware of the agreement with Collins, ABG \r\n  did not assume the lease and instead removed Collinsâ€™ machines from the premises.Â \r\nCollins then brought this action against Coats \r\n  and Coats, Wayne Coats, and ABG.Â  In its complaint, Collins asserted a claim \r\n  for breach of contract against Coats and Coats and Wayne Coats. Collins further \r\n  asserted causes of action for intentional interference with a contract, civil \r\n  conspiracy, and unfair trade practices against ABG.\r\nAt trial, the master dismissed the civil conspiracy \r\n  cause of action and found in favor of ABG on the unfair trade practices \r\n  claim.Â  The master, however, determined ABG was liable for intentional \r\n  interference with Collinsâ€™ contract and awarded actual damages of $157,449.66 \r\n  and punitive damages of $1,569,013.00. \r\n  [1] Â  The master denied ABGâ€™s post-trial motions.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motion to Amend Answer\r\nABG first contends the master erred in denying \r\n  its motion to amend its answer to conform to the evidence presented at trial.Â Â  \r\n  We find no error. \r\nIn its answer, ABG stated:Â  â€œThis Defendant admits \r\n  purchasing the businesses known as Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo from \r\n  Coats &amp; Coats Rental Agreement and Wayne Coats individually.â€Â  Before \r\n  calling any witnesses, Collinsâ€™ attorney read this statement into the record \r\n  verbatim without objection from ABG.Â  At trial, however, Wayne Coats \r\n  testified that he had no ownership interest in either business when ABG acquired \r\n  them. \r\nAfter the close of ABGâ€™s case, Collinsâ€™ attorney again \r\n  read the answer into the record.Â  This time, however, ABG moved to amend \r\n  the answer to conform to the proof.Â  In support of the motion, counsel \r\n  for ABG claimed: â€œAt the time the [a]nswer was drafted, that was the information \r\n  provided us.Â  We would ask that the [p]leadings be conformed to the proof presented.â€ \r\n  [2] Â  Collins objected to the motion, alleging the entire litigation \r\n  was based on the admission in ABGâ€™s answer.Â  The master denied the motion to \r\n  amend.\r\nCiting Rule 15(b) of the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Civil Procedure, ABG argues the master should have permitted it to amend \r\n  its answer to conform to the proof offered. \r\n  [3] Â  We agree, however, with Collins that Rule 15(b) is inapplicable to \r\n  this situation.Â  As this court stated in Sunvillas Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Square \r\n  D Co.:Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe rule covers two situations.Â  First, if an issue not \r\n  raised by the pleadings is tried by express or implied consent of the parties \r\n  the court may permit amendment of the pleadings to reflect the issue.Â  Second, \r\n  if a party objects to the introduction of evidence as not being within the \r\n  pleadings the court may permit amendment of the pleadings subject to a right \r\n  to grant a continuance if necessary. [4] \r\nHere, the issue prompting ABGâ€™s motion to amend was raised \r\n  in the complaint and admitted by ABG; therefore, the first situation did not \r\n  apply.Â  Moreover, because no objection was made as to any evidence being outside \r\n  the pleadings, the master could not have permitted an amendment pursuant to \r\n  the second part of the rule. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Interference \r\n  with Contractual RelationsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nA.\r\nABG asserts Collins failed to prove the \r\n  elements of intentional interference with contractual relations.Â  In our view, \r\n  however, the record has sufficient evidence to support a finding that Collins \r\n  proved each of the necessary elements.\r\nâ€œThe elements of a cause of action for tortious \r\n  interference with contract are:Â  (1) existence of a valid contract; (2) the \r\n  wrongdoerâ€™s knowledge thereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; \r\n  (4) the absence of justification; and (5) resulting damages.â€ \r\n  [5] \r\nAt trial, ABG contended (1) the parties to the \r\n  contracts for placement of the video poker machines at Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch \r\n  Bingo were Collins, Wayne Coats, and an entity called Coats and Coats Rental \r\n  Amusement owned by Wayne Coats; (2) the entity known as Coats and Coats Rental \r\n  Amusement that was owned by Wayne Coats was a North Carolina entity and separate \r\n  and distinct from the Coats and Coats owned by T.A. and Darlene Coats; and \r\n  (3) T.A. Coats held the ground lease on the properties where the businesses \r\n  were located.Â  ABG maintained that, because it negotiated with only T.A. Coats \r\n  for the ground leases, it could not have interfered with the video poker machine \r\n  agreement giving Collins the exclusive right to place its machines at Ponderosa \r\n  Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo, as that agreement did not involve T.A. Coats.\r\nThe master, however, found that Coats and Coats was a business \r\n  â€œconsisting of Wayne Coatsâ€™ mother and father, T.A. Coats, Wayne Coats, and \r\n  Darlene Coatsâ€ and that â€œT.A. Coats, Darlene Coats, and Wayne Coats operated \r\n  various aspects of the Ponderosa and Shipwatch businesses under various trade \r\n  names including Coats and Coats, Coats and Coats Rental Amusements, and Darleneâ€™s \r\n  Rental and Amusements, all of which were run and controlled by T.A. Coats.â€Â  \r\n  The master then determined that the â€œcontract between Collins and Coats \r\n  and Coats was negotiated by T.A. Coats and signed by Wayne Coats at his direction \r\n  and under the authority of T.A. Coats.â€Â  Finally, the master concluded \r\n  that â€œT.A. Coats ratified this contract by his actions subsequent to the placement \r\n  of Collins Machines at the Shipwatch and Ponderosa locations.â€ \r\nIn his deposition, T.A. Coats testified he negotiated the \r\n  contracts for the video poker machines to be placed in the Ponderosa and Shipwatch \r\n  locations. [6] Â  He further explained \r\n  that, because he was out of town when Collinsâ€™ representative brought the machines, \r\n  he instructed Wayne Coats to sign the contracts so the machines could be left \r\n  on the premises.Â  Finally, T.A. Coats testified that the Coats and Coats \r\n  entity that was a party to the Collins agreement was his business and, furthermore, \r\n  that the Coats and Coats entity that Wayne Coats established was not in existence \r\n  at that time. [7] \r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the record contains evidence \r\n  to support the masterâ€™s determination that Collinsâ€™ contract was with T.A. Coats \r\n  and not with Wayne Coats.Â  Although Wayne Coats may have signed the agreement, \r\n  the record supports the finding that he did this only with express authorization \r\n  from T.A. Coats to act on behalf of T.A. Coats and Coats and Coats Rental Amusement. [8] \r\nB.\r\nABG next contends it had no knowledge of any contract between \r\n  Collins and T.A. Coats and was told that Wayne had the video poker lease.Â  The \r\n  record, however, supports the finding that ABG knew that T.A. Coats was a party \r\n  to the contract at issue.\r\nT.A. Coats testified that he told Greg Wilson, Roy Stevens, \r\n  Richard Henry, and Barry Goldstein, all of ABG, that he had a contract with \r\n  Collins for the video poker machines.Â  In addition, ten of Collinsâ€™ video \r\n  poker machines were present in each location and, as required by state law, \r\n  were clearly marked as belonging to Collins.Â  T.A. Coats further stated \r\n  he told individuals at ABG that he was not going to breach the agreement and \r\n  that ABG had to remove Collinsâ€™ machines and contact Collins.Â  Roy Stevens, \r\n  ABGâ€™s state manager, testified he knew of the video poker lease with Collins \r\n  and ABG had a copy of the contract to review.Â  Barry Goldstein testified \r\n  that a copy of the Collins lease was passed around ABG â€œlike the Sunday comic \r\n  strip.â€\r\nC.\r\nABG further asserts there was no evidence presented at trial \r\n  that it either induced or coerced T.A. Coats or Wayne Coats into breaching the \r\n  video poker lease.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAccording to Roy Stevens, the purchase and sale agreement \r\n  was structured in such a way as to circumvent the Collins agreement.Â  Stevens \r\n  further testified that, if T.A. Coats refused to sell, ABG intended to run him \r\n  out of business.Â  In addition, Wayne Coats testified that (1) his family \r\n  never contemplated cancelling the Collins agreement until ABG was involved; \r\n  (2) an attempt was made to have ABG assume the Collins contract; and (3) a representative \r\n  from ABG advised his parents that â€œif they didnâ€™t sell out, that American Bingo \r\n  would eventually run them out.â€ \r\nD.\r\nFinally, ABG argues it was justified in its actions because \r\n  it believed that the Collins agreement was with Wayne Coats and that T.A. Coats \r\n  held only the ground leases on the properties.Â  As discussed above, however, \r\n  there was ample evidence to show that T.A. Coats was a party to the Collins \r\n  agreement and that ABG was aware of his involvement.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Expert \r\n  Testimony\r\nABG asserts the testimony from Collinsâ€™ \r\n  economic expert, Dr. Woodside, regarding Collinsâ€™ excess capacity of video poker \r\n  machines was hearsay and, therefore, the master improperly relied on this testimony \r\n  in calculating damages.Â  We hold the admission of Dr. Woodsideâ€™s testimony \r\n  was proper.\r\nDr. Woodside testified that Collins maintained \r\n  warehouses with additional machines.Â  He testified that, although he did not \r\n  know exactly how many machines Collins had in its warehouses, individuals with \r\n  Collins had informed him that Collins had sufficient excess capacity to fulfill \r\n  both the contract with T.A. Coats and any subsequent contracts.Â  In addition, \r\n  Dr. Woodside testified Collins routinely rotated machines from one location \r\n  to another.\r\nABG argues that what Collinsâ€™ employees had told \r\n  Dr. Woodside was hearsay.Â  We agree the information was hearsay, but hold, however, \r\n  that it was nevertheless admissible under Rule 703 of the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Evidence. [9] Â  \r\nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony \r\n  is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. \r\n  [10] Â  With regard to information on which an expert opinion is based, the \r\n  South Carolina Rules of Evidence provide as follows:\r\n\r\nThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert \r\n  bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the \r\n  expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts \r\n  in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, \r\n  the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence. [11] \r\n\r\nHere, Dr. Woodside relied on the information provided \r\n  by Collinsâ€™ employees to determine how to calculate Collinsâ€™ damages.Â  In order \r\n  to do this, he needed to assess Collinsâ€™ excess inventory of machines vis-Ã -vis \r\n  the number of locations it had available in which to place these machines.Â  \r\n  We therefore hold the hearsay testimony was the â€œtype reasonably relied \r\n  upon by experts in the particular fieldâ€ when determining how to calculate damages \r\n  and the master did not abuse his discretion in admitting the testimony. [12] \r\nIV.Â  Lost Volume \r\n  Seller Doctrine\r\nABG maintains the master erred in applying \r\n  the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ doctrine and in holding Collins did not have to mitigate \r\n  its damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe theory behind the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ \r\n  doctrine is as follows:\r\n\r\nIf the injured party could and would have entered into the \r\n  subsequent contract, even if the contract had not been broken, and could have \r\n  had the benefit of both, he can be said to have â€œlost volumeâ€ and the subsequent \r\n  transaction is not a substitute for the broken contract. The injured partyâ€™s \r\n  damages are then based on the net profit that he has lost as a result of the \r\n  broken contract. [13] \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina does not require a party \r\n  to make an unreasonable effort to mitigate. \r\n  [14] Â  Moreover, once Collins showed it had sufficient inventory â€œto place \r\n  as many [machines] as it could have found customers for,â€ [15]  it likewise established that any other deals it would have \r\n  made would have been in addition to, rather than instead of, the prior agreement.Â  \r\n  We therefore affirm the masterâ€™s use of the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ doctrine in \r\n  calculating damages in this case.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Punitive Damages\r\nABG contends the master erred in awarding punitive \r\n  damages because there was no evidence its actions were willful, intentional, \r\n  or with reckless disregard of Collinsâ€™ rights.Â  ABG further contends the amount \r\n  of punitive damages violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  \r\n  We find no error.\r\nA.\r\nÂ â€œThe purposes of punitive damages are to punish the \r\n  wrongdoer and deter the wrongdoer and others from engaging in similar reckless, \r\n  willful, wanton, or malicious conduct in the future.â€ [16] Â  â€œPunitive damages also serve \r\n  to vindicate a private right of the injured party by requiring the wrongdoer \r\n  to pay money to the injured party.â€ [17]   \r\nSouth Carolina Code section 15-33-135 provides that \r\n  â€œ[i]n any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the plaintiff has \r\n  the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing evidence.â€ [18] Â  Nevertheless, the trial court has considerable \r\n  discretion regarding the amount of damages, both actual or punitive. [19] Â  \r\nIn Gamble v. Stevenson, the supreme court mandated \r\n  the following procedure for appellate review of an punitive damages award:\r\n\r\n[T]o ensure that a punitive damage award is proper, \r\n  the trial court shall conduct a post-trial review and may consider the following: \r\n  (1) defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendantâ€™s \r\n  awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood \r\n  the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether \r\n  the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; \r\n  (7) defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and finally, (8) . . . â€œother factorsâ€ deemed \r\n  appropriate. [20] \r\n\r\nThe master based his conclusions on his findings \r\n  that the actions taken by ABG demonstrated ABGâ€™s culpability, awareness of the \r\n  contract and ultimate concealment of its desire to have Collinsâ€™ contract breached, \r\n  the harm that was caused, the deterrent effect of a punitive damages award, \r\n  and ABGâ€™s ability to pay.\r\nWe hold there was evidence that ABGâ€™s conduct was \r\n  willful, intentional, and in disregard of Collinsâ€™ rights.Â  Evidence was presented \r\n  at trial of ABGâ€™s intention to run T.A. Coats out of business if he did not \r\n  agree to its request to purchase his business.Â  ABG was made aware of the agreement \r\n  between Collins and T.A. Coats, but nevertheless set up the purchase of the \r\n  Ponderosa and Shipwatch locations in an attempt to avoid having to comply with \r\n  the provisions of the lease.\r\nAs the master noted, ABG was â€œaware of the fact \r\n  that Collins would suffer a serious economic loss if its contract was cancelled \r\n  and Collinsâ€™ machines were removed.â€Â  Also, ABG gained from procuring \r\n  the breach of the contract because it would not have to share the revenues with \r\n  Collins, but could instead install machines from another source and retain 100 \r\n  per cent of the profits.\r\nOn appeal, ABG focuses on the fact the video poker \r\n  industry no longer exists and, therefore, there is no opportunity for recidivism.Â  \r\n  Although the video poker gaming industry is no longer legal in South Carolina, \r\n  the conduct could nevertheless be continued in other industries.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the possibility of future conduct is only one of several factors to consider.Â  \r\n  Given the egregious conduct by ABG and its total disregard for Collinsâ€™ rights, \r\n  we uphold the masterâ€™s decision to award punitive damages.\r\nB.\r\nABG also maintains the amount awarded was excessive \r\n  and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \r\n  States Constitution.Â  Although the punitive damages award greatly exceeded Collinsâ€™ \r\n  actual damages, we hold the award did not violate due process.\r\nâ€œPunitive damages may properly be imposed to further \r\n  a Stateâ€™s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its \r\n  repetition.â€ [21] Â  â€œOnly when an award can fairly \r\n  be categorized as â€˜grossly excessiveâ€™ in relation to these interests does it \r\n  enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the \r\n  Fourteenth Amendment.â€ [22]   \r\nAs noted by the Supreme Court, â€œunlimited jury \r\n  discretionâ€”or unlimited judicial discretion for that matterâ€”in the fixing of \r\n  punitive damages may invite extreme results that jar oneâ€™s constitutional sensibilities.â€ [23] Â  Nevertheless, as one commentator \r\n  has recently noted, â€œ[g]enerally, attorneys should be cautioned against relying \r\n  on the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to argue the constitutionality \r\n  of awards.Â  Although the ratio is a factor universally argued, there is no consistent \r\n  pattern in its application.â€ [24] \r\n  \r\nIn BMW of North America v. Gore, the Supreme \r\n  Court provided the following â€œguidepostsâ€ for determining the reasonableness \r\n  of a punitive damages award:Â  (1) the degree of reprehensibility, (2) the ratio \r\n  of the punitive damages award to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff, \r\n  and (3) the comparison of the punitive damages award and the civil or criminal \r\n  penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct. \r\n  [25] Â  We examine each of these three factors as it applies to the present \r\n  case.\r\n1.\r\nâ€œPerhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness \r\n  of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s \r\n  conduct.â€ [26] Â  In the present case, ABGâ€™s \r\n  conduct was clearly wrongful, calculated, and improper.Â  ABG intentionally interfered \r\n  with a contract, and this interference inured to the detriment of one of the \r\n  parties to the contract.Â  Although ABG argues Collins suffered only economic \r\n  harm, the degree of reprehensibility was still significant.Â  ABG went to great \r\n  lengths to ensure that it would get out from under the Collins agreement, be \r\n  able to place its own machines at the Ponderosa and Shipwatch locations, and \r\n  then be entitled to indemnification if anything went awry.Â  Moreover, in addition \r\n  to the unusual indemnification provision in the purchase and sale agreement, \r\n  there was also evidence that ABG further attempted to insulate itself from liability \r\n  by creating a shell corporation with no assets in case â€œthe deal went sour.â€ [27] \r\n2.\r\nThe second factor is the ratio of punitive \r\n  damages to actual damages.Â  ABG contends a ratio of 10 to 1 is excessive.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  In his order, the master stated the award was â€œin part based upon \r\n  [his] firm conviction that American Bingo and others must not be allowed to \r\n  profit from misconduct of the type established in this case.â€ \r\n  [28] Â  Moreover, we note that, in recent reported decisions, the appellate \r\n  courts of this State have upheld punitive damages awards with relationships \r\n  to the actual damages awarded that have been comparably proportionate to the \r\n  ratio in the present case, even when the tortious conduct resulted in economic \r\n  rather physical harm. [29] \r\n3.\r\nFinally, in Gore, the Supreme Court \r\n  held that state courts, when reviewing punitive damages awards for excessiveness, \r\n  must â€œcompar[e] the punitive damages award and the civil or criminal penalties \r\n  that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.â€ [30] Â  Justice Stevens, writing for the Court in Gore, stated \r\n  that â€œa reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive \r\n  damages is excessive should â€˜accord â€œsubstantial deferenceâ€ to legislative judgments \r\n  concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.â€™â€ \r\n  [31] Â  In the present case, however, we were not able to locate any â€œlegislative \r\n  judgmentsâ€ imposing civil or criminal penalties for tortious interference with \r\n  a contract, and counsel has not directed our attention to any such statute.Â  \r\n  In our view, the absence of statutory sanctions for the specific misconduct \r\n  complained of here poses a dilemma not unlike that in cases in which the reviewing \r\n  court recognized that the statutory penalty was set at â€œsuch a low level, there \r\n  is little basis for comparing it with any meaningful punitive damages award.â€ \r\n  [32] Â  \r\nMoreover, we reject ABGâ€™s argument that the sanctions \r\n  provided in the South Carolina Antitrust Act and the South Carolina Unfair Trade \r\n  Practices Act are for â€œcomparable misconduct.â€Â  Historically, the availability \r\n  of these sanctions has not precluded punitive damages awards for related causes \r\n  of action even when the plaintiff has also recovered under one of these acts \r\n  in the same lawsuit. [33] Â  In our view, then, these statutory penalties \r\n  are not necessarily for â€œsimilar misconductâ€ to the extent that they would restrict \r\n  the right of a finder of fact to determine an aggrieved litigantâ€™s entitlement \r\n  to a well-established form of redress. \r\n  [34] Â Â  \r\nFinally, with regard to ABGâ€™s allegation that, \r\n  to date, the largest ratio of punitive damages to actual damages for tortious \r\n  interference with contractual relations in any reported decision issued in this \r\n  State is 6 to 1, [35]  we find it significant that, \r\n  notwithstanding the heightened scrutiny by the United States Supreme Court of \r\n  punitive damages awards in recent cases, the Court has been reluctant to impose \r\n  a bright-line ratio in a due process analysis. [36] Â  Moreover, the majority in Gore observed that â€œ[i]n \r\n  most cases, the ratio will be well within a constitutionally acceptable range, \r\n  and remittitur will not be justified on this basis.â€ \r\n  [37] Â  In our view, we hold the ratio of punitive to actual damages in this \r\n  case, which was less than 10 to 1, was not excessive in view of the evidence \r\n  of ABGâ€™s carefully orchestrated scheme to interfere with Collinsâ€™ contract and \r\n  of ABGâ€™s attempt to shield itself from liability. \r\n  [38] Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp; \r\n  V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion to Supplement\r\nABG contends the master erred in \r\n  failing to allow it to supplement the record with additional information regarding \r\n  its financial condition and more recent financial statements.Â  We find no abuse \r\n  of discretion. [39]   \r\nThe information ABG purportedly sought \r\n  to introduce consisted of a letter from an accounting firm concerning the current \r\n  financial status of Littlefield Corporation, the successor-in-interest to ABG.Â  \r\n  The certified public accountant who prepared the letter opined that, based on \r\n  his analysis, the amount of punitive damages awarded represented approximately \r\n  27 per cent of the available net equity of Littlefield.Â  ABG maintained this \r\n  information was not available when the case was tried in September 2000 and \r\n  did not become available until December 2000.\r\nThe master heard the case on September \r\n  18, 2000, and his final order was dated February 6, 2001.Â  ABG, however, did \r\n  not file its motion to supplement the record until March 19, 2001, more than \r\n  one month after judgment was rendered.Â  Even assuming the information that ABG \r\n  sought to include in the record was, as ABG contended, unavailable until December \r\n  2000, ABG has offered no reason as to why it never moved to supplement the record \r\n  during the weeks that passed between the time it received the documents and \r\n  the filing of the masterâ€™s order and instead waited until after judgment to proffer the information.Â  We hold this \r\n  reason alone is sufficient to justify the masterâ€™s denial of ABGâ€™s motion to \r\n  supplement the record.

Mosteller, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nB. Michael Brackett, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Janice Taylor Clark, the illegitimate daughter of Henry \r\n  Taylor, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision that the remainder devise to the \r\n  â€œchild or childrenâ€ of Taylor in Item I of Gordon Boyntonâ€™s will did not include \r\n  illegitimate children.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBoynton died testate in 1954, devising a life estate in an \r\n  860 acre farm to Taylor with the remainder to Taylorâ€™s child or children and \r\n  a contingent remainder to Boyntonâ€™s heirs at law should Taylor die without children. \r\n  Taylor died in 1995 with Clark as his only issue.Â  On December 6, 2000, Ervin \r\n  Mathias, as co-personal representative of Boyntonâ€™s estate, and Boyntonâ€™s heirs \r\n  filed a complaint in probate court seeking a declaratory judgment that Boyntonâ€™s \r\n  use of the words â€œchild or children,â€ by definition, excluded Clark because \r\n  she was illegitimate. [1] Â  By agreement of the parties, the matter was \r\n  submitted on stipulated facts and briefs to the probate court.Â  The probate \r\n  court found Clark was the â€œsole remainderman of the life estate interestâ€ under \r\n  Boyntonâ€™s will.Â  Mathias appealed to the circuit court.Â  Clark cross-appealed, \r\n  alleging the probate court erred in refusing to consider evidence outside the \r\n  written stipulations.Â  The circuit court dismissed the cross-appeal and reversed \r\n  the probate court. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen an appeal involves \r\n  stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to review whether \r\n  the trial court properly applied the law to those facts.â€Â  WDW Props. v. \r\n  City of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000).Â  â€œIn such cases, \r\n  the appellate court owes no particular deference to the trial courtâ€™s legal \r\n  conclusions.â€Â  J.K. Constr., Inc. v. W. Carolina Regâ€™l Sewer Auth., 336 \r\n  S.C. 162, 166, 519 S.E.2d 561, 563 (2001); see also Duke Power Co. \r\n  v. Laurens Elec. Coop., Inc., 344 S.C. 101, 104, 543 S.E.2d 560, 561-62 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal from the final order of the probate court, the circuit \r\n  court should apply the same standard of review that the Supreme Court or Court \r\n  of Appeals would apply on appeal.Â  In re Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 \r\n  S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nClark argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it applied 1954 law to construe the language of Boyntonâ€™s will.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, the provisions of a will and restrictions on the power \r\n  of testamentary disposition are determined according to the law in effect at \r\n  the time of the testatorâ€™s death or the time when the will is executed.Â  79 \r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Wills Â§ 55 (2002); see 4 Bowe-Parker, Page on Wills \r\n  Â§ 30.27 (1961 &amp; Supp. 2003); 96 C.J.S. Wills Â§ 880 (2001).Â  A will \r\n  speaks at the time of the testatorâ€™s death.Â  See, e.g., Shelley v. \r\n  Shelley, 244 S.C. 598, 605, 137 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1964); Landrum v. Branyon, \r\n  161 S.C. 235, 246-48, 159 S.E. 546, 550 (1931).Â  The modern probate code, which \r\n  took effect in 1987, states â€œa substantive right in the decedentâ€™s estate accrues \r\n  in accordance with the law in effect on the date of the decedentâ€™s death.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-100(b)(4) (Supp. 2002).Â  Boynton executed his will in \r\n  August 1954 and died three weeks later.Â  Thus, the law as it existed in 1954 \r\n  applies.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nClark insists to construe the will the court should apply the law as it existed \r\n  at the time of the death of the life tenant Taylor.Â  Clark relies on the holding \r\n  in Freeman v. Freeman, 323 S.C. 95, 100-105, 473 S.E.2d 467, 471-73 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) and Haskell v. Wilmington Trust Co., 304 A.2d 53 (Del.Â  1973) \r\n  superseded by statute as stated in Annan v. Wilmington Trust Co., \r\n  559 A.2d 1289, 1292 n.2 (Del. 1989).Â  Freeman concerned an illegitimate \r\n  heir who was not permitted to inherit from her putative father because she could \r\n  not satisfy the condition set out in Mitchell&nbsp;v. Hardwick, 297 S.C. \r\n  48, 51, 374 S.E.2d 681, 683 (1988) that she conclusively establish paternity \r\n  within the statutory timeframe.Â  Freeman did not involve a testate estate, \r\n  will construction, or a determination of whether the date of death law or subsequent \r\n  law controlled the construction of a will.Â  Further, even though Haskell \r\n  may be persuasive, holdings of the Delaware Supreme Court are not binding on \r\n  this court.Â  We know no rule or precedent under South Carolina law requiring \r\n  a testator who makes a devise to a class whose membership could close at a point \r\n  after the testatorâ€™s death to contemplate all the changes that could occur in \r\n  the controlling law subsequent to his death.Â  Thus, the law as it existed in \r\n  1954 controls. \r\nClark argues that the application of more current law would require an equal \r\n  protection analysis under Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762 (1977), which \r\n  held it unconstitutional to create legal distinctions between legitimate and \r\n  illegitimate childrenâ€™s inheritance rights under statutes of descent and distribution, \r\n  and its progeny.Â  See Mitchell v. Hardwick, 297 S.C. 48, 374 S.E.2d \r\n  681 (1988); Wilson v. Jones, 281 S.C. 230, 314 S.E.2d 341 (1984).Â  In \r\n  the alternative, Clark urges retroactive application of Trimbleâ€™s equal \r\n  protection doctrine if the court determines 1954 law controls. \r\nThe equal protection analysis in Trimble is inapplicable.Â  \r\n  The question before this court is whether Boynton intended to include illegitimate \r\n  children when he used the term â€œchild or children of Henry Taylorâ€ in his 1954 \r\n  will.Â  Trimble addresses the question of an illegitimate childâ€™s right \r\n  or ability to inherit from the intestate estate of his parent pursuant to a \r\n  state intestacy statute. No state action or intestacy in this case requires \r\n  the application of equal protection principles.Â  Equal protection is only implicated \r\n  where there is state action.Â  See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., \r\n  457 U.S. 922 (1982).Â  Private conduct does not raise an equal protection violation.Â  \r\n  See id.Â  South Carolina law is well settled that a testator may \r\n  devise his property any way he sees fit, as long as it is not contrary to law \r\n  or public policy.Â  See Hellams v. Ross, 268 S.C. 284, 290, 233 \r\n  S.E.2d 98, 101 (1977); Brown v. Drake, 275 S.C. 299, 270 S.E.2d 130 (1980).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nClark also relies on the public policy advanced by the probate court \r\n  that applying 1954 common law would be unconstitutional, contrary to In re \r\n  Estate of Mercer, 288 S.C. 313, 317, 342 S.E.2d 591, 593 (1986) (citing \r\n  Trimble, 430 U.S. at 762)Â  (â€œThe stateâ€™s interest in the sanctity of \r\n  marriage is not substantially related to limiting the inheritance rights of \r\n  a certain class of illegitimate children.â€).Â  Clarkâ€™s reliance on Mercer \r\n  is misplaced.Â  Mercer found South Carolina Code Annotated Â§ 21-7-480 \r\n  (1976) unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because it limited what \r\n  a married man could devise to his mistress or illegitimate child.Â  The facts \r\n  and result are inapposite to the issue in this case, since no statute prohibits \r\n  Boynton devising to illegitimate children.Â  Rather, our concern is determining \r\n  the testatorâ€™s intent under the intestacy law, which he is presumed to know.\r\nClark argues the court erred in determining the remainder to Taylorâ€™s â€œchild \r\n  or childrenâ€ in Boyntonâ€™s will excluded illegitimate children.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, the law provides that the \r\n  word â€œchildrenâ€ does not include illegitimate children, except when the testatorâ€™s \r\n  intent to include them is clear.Â  96 C.J.S. Wills Â§ 934 (2001).Â  The \r\n  law of South Carolina in 1954 embraced this view.Â  See Shearman v. \r\n  Angel, 8 S.C. Eq. (Bail. Eq.) 351 (1831) (illegitimate children cannot take \r\n  with legitimate children where testator devises to â€œchildrenâ€); Wish v. Kershaw, \r\n  8 S.C. Eq. (Bail. Eq.) 353 (1827) (parol or extrinsic evidence cannot be admitted \r\n  to show testatorâ€™s intent to include illegitimate takers); see also \r\n  Coleman Karesh, Wills 7 (1977) (general rule of construction that gift \r\n  by will to testatorâ€™s children or the children of another includes only legitimate \r\n  children). \r\nClark argues that Wish and Shearman are limited to \r\n  a narrow set of facts where legitimate and illegitimate children are competing \r\n  to take from the same devise.Â  She cites the courtâ€™s language in Wish \r\n  that:Â  â€œIf there had been any legitimate children, they would have been understood \r\n  to be the persons designated [to take as â€œchildrenâ€]; but there being none, \r\n  we are driven to the inquiry, whether there are any persons in existence, who \r\n  had acquired the reputation of children.â€Â  Clark interprets the courtâ€™s opinion \r\n  to mean that where the only surviving child is illegitimate, then extrinsic \r\n  evidence may be introduced to prove reputation as a child.Â  Clark then presents \r\n  the family courtâ€™s determination and evidence presented in that case as proof \r\n  of her reputation as Henry Taylorâ€™s illegitimate child.Â  \r\nWe decline to accept Clarkâ€™s interpretation of the holding in Wish.Â  \r\n  In Wish, the testatrix died leaving an illegitimate grandchild and several \r\n  legitimate grandchildren.Â  The issue was whether extrinsic or parol evidence \r\n  could be admitted to prove there was an illegitimate grandchild and that the \r\n  testatrix intended to include her.Â  Parol evidence was excluded.Â  The court \r\n  in Wish cited case law that â€œan illegitimate child was held not to be \r\n  under the description of a child contained in the Will; although the testator \r\n  knew the state of the family, and that there were several illegitimate, and \r\n  no legitimate children.â€Â  \r\nBoth Clark and Taylor were alive in 1954 when Boynton executed his will.Â  Boynton \r\n  did not choose to designate Clark as a devisee by name or description.Â  He chose \r\n  instead to leave a remainder interest to the â€œchild or childrenâ€ of Henry Taylor.Â  \r\n  â€œ[P]rovisions in a will are presumed to be made with an understanding of, and \r\n  intent to act pursuant to, law and public policy as it exists when the will \r\n  is executed . . . .â€Â  80 Am. Jur. 2d Wills Â§ 1219 (2002).Â  The common \r\n  law governing testamentary dispositions in 1954 recognized a narrow definition \r\n  for the terms â€œchildâ€ and â€œchildrenâ€ to mean only legitimate children.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the remainder interest to the â€œchild or children of Henry Taylorâ€ in Boyntonâ€™s \r\n  will does not include illegitimate children.Â  \r\nClark argues the circuit court erred in dismissing her cross-appeal \r\n  that the probate court erred by refusing to consider evidence outside the partiesâ€™ \r\n  agreed stipulation of facts.Â  We disagree.\r\nClark agreed to submit the matter to the probate court on stipulated facts.Â  \r\n  She made no objection to limiting the record to the stipulations nor did she \r\n  reserve the right to present evidence outside of the stipulations.Â  4 C.J.S. \r\n  Appeal &amp; Error Â§ 185 (1993) (A party who voluntarily acquiesces in \r\n  or takes a position inconsistent with the right to appeal impliedly waives or \r\n  is estopped to assert his right to appellate review.).Â  Thus, Clarkâ€™s cross-appeal \r\n  was properly dismissed.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  This case overlaps with a closely related paternity action \r\n    filed by Clark.Â  This court affirmed the family courtâ€™s finding that Taylor \r\n    was Clarkâ€™s father.Â  Clark v.

[and] the right of reasonable access across the properties \r\n  of [Lighthouse] as may be necessary from time to time to maintain the water \r\n  and sewer systems.â€\r\nAlmost two decades after the easement was granted, \r\n  South Island began leasing space on top of its water tower to Telecom for the \r\n  installation of antennae, support equipment, and emergency power generation \r\n  equipment.Â  To install and maintain the telecommunications equipment, South \r\n  Island leased to Telecom the use of the easement, permitting Telecom to travel \r\n  over Lighthouseâ€™s property.Â  Following the execution of the lease agreements, \r\n  Telecom began moving equipment onto and through the easement.Â  None of the equipment \r\n  was necessary for maintaining the water or sewer systems.\r\nLighthouse brought this declaratory judgment action \r\n  to enjoin South Island from using its property in violation of the easement.Â  \r\n  The parties stipulated the question presented was whether the easementâ€™s use, \r\n  as provided in the lease agreements, constituted a non-permitted use of the \r\n  easement property.Â  The circuit court found the easement did not permit South \r\n  Island to use the easement property for any purpose except â€œto operate and maintain \r\n  [Lighthouseâ€™s] water and sewer systems.â€Â  Thus, the circuit court ruled the \r\n  easementâ€™s use, as contemplated in the lease agreements, was a non-permitted \r\n  use of the easement property.Â  South Island appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Extent of Easement\r\nSouth Island argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  finding the easement does not permit South Island or its assignees to use the \r\n  easement across Lighthouseâ€™s property for any purpose except â€œto operate and \r\n  maintain [Lighthouseâ€™s] water and sewer systems.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal \r\n  nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts \r\n  v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  â€œ[T]he \r\n  determination of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in equity.Â  \r\n  Thus, this Court may take its own view of the evidence . . . .â€Â  Tupper v. \r\n  Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997) (internal \r\n  citation omitted).\r\nSouth Island argues the granting clause of the \r\n  easement created a complete and absolute estate, which could not be limited \r\n  by the subsequent description of the easement.Â  As authority for its position, \r\n  South Island cites and strongly relies on Abbeville County v. Knox, 267 \r\n  S.C. 38, 225 S.E.2d 863 (1976) and Stylecraft, Inc. v. Thomas, 250 S.C. \r\n  495, 159 S.E.2d 46 (1968) for the proposition that once an estate has been granted \r\n  in a deed, subsequent words attempting to limit the grant of that estate are \r\n  ineffective.Â  However, South Islandâ€™s reliance on these two cases is misplaced.\r\n\r\nIn [Groce v. S. Ry. Co., 164 S.C. 427, 162 S.E. 425 \r\n  (1932) and Stylecraft], the granting clause created a fee simple estate \r\n  in the grantee.\r\n\r\n.Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â  .\r\n\r\n[Thus, the] court held in both cases that [any subsequent] \r\n  limitations upon the use of the property conveyed were ineffectual under the \r\n  established rule that where the granting clause in a deed conveys a fee simple \r\n  title that estate may not be cut down by subsequent words in the same instrument.\r\n\r\nDouglas v. Med. Investors, Inc., 256 S.C \r\n  440, 446, 182 S.E.2d 720, 722-23 (1971) (emphasis added). [1] Â  In the present case, the deed in question never granted South \r\n  Island a fee estate.Â  Thus, we find these cases and the general premise of law \r\n  for which they are cited are not applicable with respect to the grant of an \r\n  easement.\r\nThe grant of an easement does not create a complete \r\n  and absolute estate.Â  See id. at 445, 182 S.E.2d at 772 (holding \r\n  â€œ[a]n easement is . . . not an estate in lands in the usual senseâ€).Â  Rather, \r\n  â€œ[a]n easement is a right which one person has to use the land of another for \r\n  a specific purpose,â€ Steele v. Williams, 204 S.C. 124, 132, 28 \r\n  S.E.2d 644, 647 (1944) (emphasis added), and â€œgives no title to the land on \r\n  which the servitude is imposed.â€Â  Morris v. Townsend, 253 S.C. 628, 635, \r\n  172 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1970).\r\nâ€œThe general rule is that the character of an express \r\n  easement is determined by the nature of the right and intention of the parties \r\n  creating it.â€Â  Smith v. Commâ€™rs of Pub. Works of City of Charleston, \r\n  312 S.C. 460, 467, 441 S.E.2d 331, 336 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  To determine the purpose \r\n  of the easement, we must evaluate the intention of the parties when the easement \r\n  was granted.Â  In doing so, the â€œ[c]lear and unambiguous language in grants of \r\n  easement[s] must be construed according to terms which parties have used, taken, \r\n  and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  S.C. Pub. Serv. \r\n  Auth. v. Ocean Forest, Inc., 275 S.C. 552, 554, 273 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1981).Â  \r\n  Moreover, we must effectuate the partiesâ€™ intention â€œunless that intention contravenes \r\n  some well-settled rule of law or public policy.â€Â  Gardner v. Mozingo, \r\n  293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 391 (1987).Â  \r\nIn reviewing the law of this state, we find â€œno \r\n  settled rule of law which would prohibit [us from] giving effect to the intent \r\n  of the partiesâ€ when construing the grant of an easement with its subsequent \r\n  description where both are contained within the same instrument.Â  See \r\n  Douglas, 256 S.C at 446, 182 S.E.2d at 722.\r\nContained within the deed conveying the adjoining \r\n  property to South Islandâ€™s predecessor is the grant of the easement at issue \r\n  in this case, which provides South Island an\r\n\r\neasement . . . over all open area[s], driveways, and parking \r\n  lots . . . to service the said water and sewer lines and ingress and egress \r\n  to all adjacent pump stations, wells, tank sites, etc.\r\n\r\n.Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â  .\r\n\r\nto do whatever acts are necessary . . . to operate and maintain \r\n  the . . . water and sewer systems . . . [and] the right of reasonable access \r\n  across the properties of [Lighthouse] as may be necessary from time to time \r\n  to maintain the water and sewer systems.\r\n\r\nClearly the easement grants South Island the right \r\n  to use Lighthouseâ€™s property.Â  However, reading the grant in light of the clear \r\n  and unambiguous terms contained within the easementâ€™s description, we agree \r\n  with the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that the easement does not permit South Island \r\n  to use the easement property for any purpose except â€œto operate and maintain \r\n  [Lighthouseâ€™s] water and sewer systems.â€Â  Thus, because the easement is limited \r\n  to those acts necessary to operate and maintain the water and sewer systems, \r\n  we conclude neither South Island nor Telecom is permitted to use the easement \r\n  as access over Lighthouseâ€™s property to install and maintain telecommunications \r\n  equipment.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Alter or Amend\r\nAfter the circuit court issued its initial order, \r\n  South Island moved pursuant to Rules 52(b), 59(e), and 60(a), SCRCP, to have \r\n  the circuit court amend its judgment.Â  Specifically, South Island asked the \r\n  circuit court to review its order and clarify a contradictory factual finding.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, the circuit court issued an amended order in which it changed \r\n  the contradictory factual finding to conform with its original legal conclusion.Â  \r\n  South Island argues the circuit court erred in amending its order.\r\nIn its motion to alter or amend the judgment, South \r\n  Island asked the circuit court to review its order and clarify a contradictory \r\n  finding.Â  The rules cited by South Island in its motion specifically provide \r\n  the circuit court with the authority to amend its findings or correct clerical \r\n  mistakes.Â  See Rules 52(b), 59(e), &amp; 60(a), SCRCP.Â  Thus, in light \r\n  of South Islandâ€™s request, we find the circuit court did not err in amending \r\n  its order to remove any confusion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order, finding the grant of the easement does not permit South Island or its \r\n  assignees to use the easement across Lighthouseâ€™s property for any purpose except \r\n  â€œto operate and maintain [Lighthouseâ€™s] water and sewer systems,â€ and the easementâ€™s \r\n  use, as contemplated in the lease agreements, constituted a non-permitted use \r\n  of the easement property is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., and STROM, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Although Douglas does not directly address Abbeville County, \r\n    we find its discussion of Groce and Stylecraft consistent with \r\n    our reading of Abbeville County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3665","title":"Fisher v.

Poindexter, individually and d/b/a/ Low Country Tops Wrecker \r\n  Service, and Speedway of South Carolina, Incorporated (â€œSpeedwayâ€), for injuries \r\n  suffered after falling from a wrecker truck at the Myrtle Beach Motor Speedway. \r\n  [1] Â  All parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment seeking a determination \r\n  of whether the Release and Waiver of Liability and Indemnity Agreement signed \r\n  by Fisher bars Fisherâ€™s recovery.Â  The trial court partially granted Fisherâ€™s \r\n  motion for summary judgment as to Stevens and Poindexter.Â  The trial court also \r\n  denied summary judgment to Speedway, finding a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  existed concerning whether a master/servant relationship existed between Speedway \r\n  and Fisher. [2] Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 10, 2000, Fisher served on a wrecker crew at \r\n  Speedway.Â  Fisher signed a release to gain access to the pit area where the \r\n  wrecker was located and did not pay admission.Â  Fisher had signed the release \r\n  and served on a wrecker crew on numerous prior occasions.Â  The release states \r\n  in applicable part:\r\n\r\nRELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT\r\nTHIS SECTION MUST BE CAREFULLY READ AND SIGNED BY THE APPLICANT \r\n  IN CONSIDERATION OF BEING PERMITTED TO ENTER FOR ANY PURPOSE ANY RESTRICTED \r\n  AREA (herein defined as including but not limited to the racing surface, pit \r\n  areas, infield, paddock area, grandstand area, and all walkways, concessions, \r\n  and other areas appurtenant to any area where any activity related to the EVENT(S) \r\n  shall take place) or being permitted to compete, officiate, observe, work for, \r\n  or for any purpose participate in any way in the EVENT(S) . . . .Â  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  HEREBY RELEASES, WAIVES, DISCHARGES AND COVENANTS \r\n  NOT TO SUE THE PROMOTERS, PARTICIPANTS, RACING ASSOCIATION, SANCTIONING ORGANIZA- \r\n  TION OR ANY SUBDIVISION THEREOF, TRACK OPERATOR, TRACK OWNER, OFFICIALS, VEHICLE \r\n  OWNERS, DRIVERS, PIT CREWS, ANY PERSONS IN ANY RESTRICTED AREA . . .

EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED further expressly agrees \r\n  that the foregoing release, waiver, and indemnity agreement is intended to be \r\n  as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the Province or State in \r\n  which the EVENT(S) is conducted . . . . \r\n\r\nDuring a race on the day of the accident, two racecars \r\n  crashed on the racing surface and Fisherâ€™s wrecker responded to retrieve one \r\n  of the vehicles.Â  Fisher was riding on the back of a wrecker driven by Stevens \r\n  and owned by Poindexter.Â  After briefly slowing down to ask if the driver of \r\n  the first car needed assistance, the wrecker moved off towards the second car.Â  \r\n  Fisher fell off the wrecker, suffering severe head injuries.Â  \r\nFisher brought suit alleging negligence, gross negligence, \r\n  and recklessness.Â  Stevens, Poindexter, and Speedway asserted the release as \r\n  an affirmative defense.Â  All parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, \r\n  asking for a determination of whether the release acted as complete bar to Fisherâ€™s \r\n  claims.Â  The trial court granted partial summary judgment to Fisher against \r\n  Stevens and Poindexter, finding the release, as a matter of law, does not bar \r\n  Fisherâ€™s claims.Â  The court denied summary judgment to Speedway, finding an \r\n  issue of fact existed concerning whether Fisher was an employee of the Speedway, \r\n  thus invalidating the release as being contrary to public policy.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 537 (1991).Â  Summary judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable \r\n  issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably \r\n  drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.â€Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, \r\n  61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Partial \r\n  Grant of Summary Judgment\r\nStevens and Poindexter argue the trial \r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment to Fisher and finding the Release inapplicable \r\n  to them as a matter of law.Â  Stevens and Poindexter contend the Release applies \r\n  to them pursuant to the language releasing â€œVEHICLE OWNERS, DRIVERS, [and] . \r\n  . . ANY PERSONS IN ANY RESTRICTED AREAâ€ from any liability.Â  \r\nOur Supreme Court, in recognition of the \r\n  freedom of private parties to contract as they choose, previously has upheld \r\n  exculpatory contracts such as the one in this case.Â  Huckaby v. Confederate \r\n  Motor Speedway, Inc., 276 S.C. 629, 281 S.E.2d 223 (1981); Pride v. Southern \r\n  Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 244 S.C. 615, 138 S.E.2d 155 (1964).Â  In Huckaby, \r\n  the Court addressed a waiver and release form in the context of a racetrack \r\n  and held a waiver agreement voluntarily entered into by a racecar driver barred \r\n  his cause of action for negligence against the defendant speedway.Â  Huckaby, \r\n  276 S.C. at 630, 281 S.E.2d at 224.Â  The Court noted several jurisdictions have \r\n  upheld the validity of releases from liability for injuries arising in connection \r\n  with automobile racing against public policy challenges to their enforcement.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nHowever, notwithstanding the general acceptance \r\n  of exculpatory contracts, â€œ[s]ince such provisions tend to induce a want of \r\n  care, they are not favored by the law and will be strictly construed against \r\n  the party relying thereon.â€Â  Pride, 244 S.C. at 619, 138 S.E.2d at 157.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nCommon sense and good faith are the leading touchstones of \r\n  the construction of a contract and contracts are to be so construed as to avoid \r\n  an absurd result.Â  Where one construction would make a contract unusual or extraordinary \r\n  and another, equally consistent, would make the contract reasonable, fair and \r\n  just, the latter construction will prevail.Â Â  \r\n\r\nGeorgetown Mfg. &amp; Warehouse Co. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Agric., 301 S.C. 514, 518, 392 S.E.2d 801, 804 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990).\r\nStevens and Poindexter first claim they \r\n  are clearly encompassed within the language of the release since they were the \r\n  driver and owner, respectively, of the wrecker.Â  However, as the trial court \r\n  found, the terms â€œvehicle ownerâ€ and â€œdriverâ€ are used in this setting to denote \r\n  the owner and driver of a competing racecar.Â  The NASCAR rulebook governing \r\n  events at the Myrtle Beach Motor Speedway includes the terms â€œdriversâ€ and â€œcar \r\n  ownersâ€ within the definition of a â€œcompetitor.â€ [3] Â  These two terms of art are not used to identify any \r\n  owner or driver of any vehicle.Â  This provision cannot be construed to \r\n  exempt Stevens and Poindexter from liability for their negligence â€œâ€˜in the absence \r\n  of explicit language clearly indicating that such was the intent of the parties.â€™â€Â  \r\n  South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Combustion Engâ€™g, Inc., 283 S.C. \r\n  182, 191, 322 S.E.2d 453, 458 (Ct. App. 1984) (quoting Hill v. Carolina Freight \r\n  Carriers Corp., 71 S.E.2d 133, 137 (N.C. 1952)); see also Dobratz \r\n  v. Thomson, 468 N.W.2d 654 (Wis. 1991) (finding an exculpatory contract \r\n  unenforceable as a matter of law due to its ambiguity and uncertainty and stating \r\n  the facts and circumstances of the agreement must express the intent of the \r\n  parties with particularity).Â  Neither the wrecker, nor its owner or driver, \r\n  was explicitly mentioned in the release.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err \r\n  in strictly construing the language of the release to apply to only the owner \r\n  and driver of a competing racecar.Â  \r\nStevens and Poindexter additionally rely \r\n  on the phrase in the agreement purporting to release â€œANY PERSONS IN ANY RESTRICTED \r\n  AREAâ€ from liability.Â  As the trial court found, this phrase is overly broad \r\n  and its enforcement would offend notions of public policy.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina courts have not specifically \r\n  addressed whether an overbroad exculpatory contract contravenes public policy.Â  \r\n  In an analogous case, Murray v. Texas Co., 172 S.C. 399, 174 S.E. 231 \r\n  (1934), our Supreme Court addressed whether an indemnity provision relieved \r\n  a defendant from liability for its own negligence.Â  The Court found the following \r\n  provision to be broad and comprehensive, yet provocative of some doubt:Â  â€œThe \r\n  agent shall . . . exonerate the Company and hold it harmless from all claims, \r\n  suits, and liabilities of every character whatsoever and howsoever arising from \r\n  the existence or use of the equipment at said station.â€Â  Id. at 401-02, \r\n  174 S.E. at 231-32.Â  Resolving all doubt in favor of the plaintiff, the Court \r\n  found the parties did not intend for the contract to relieve the defendant from \r\n  all liability for its own negligence since it could have plainly stated such \r\n  if that was the intention of the parties.Â  Id. at 402-03, 174 S.E. at \r\n  232.Â  Thus, in Murray, the Court resolved the issue on a contractual \r\n  basis, rather than on public policy grounds.Â  See also Fed. Pac. Elec. \r\n  v. Carolina Prod. Enters., 298 S.C. 23, 28-29, 378 S.E.2d 56, 58-59 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989) (finding a broad, comprehensive indemnity provision to be nonetheless \r\n  provocative of some doubt concerning its application, thus resolving doubt in \r\n  favor of party against whom enforcement is sought).\r\nIn Richards v. Richards, 513 N.W.2d \r\n  118 (Wis. 1994), the court found an overly broad exculpatory contract void because \r\n  it was against public policy.Â  In Richards, a truck driverâ€™s employer \r\n  required the driverâ€™s wife to sign a â€œPassenger Authorizationâ€ form before she \r\n  could accompany her husband.Â  The language of the form purported to relieve \r\n  the employer and â€œall affiliated, associated, or subsidiary companies, partnerships, \r\n  individuals, or corporations, and all other persons, firms, or corporationsâ€ \r\n  from any and all liability for harm to the person signing the form.Â  Id. \r\n  at 119-122.Â  In holding this provision overly broad and in contravention of \r\n  public policy, the court noted the â€œvery breadth of the release raises questions \r\n  about its meaning . . . .â€Â  Id. at 122.Â Â Â  \r\nIf we agreed with Stevens and Poindexter, the language \r\n  of the release in the present case would release from liability any person in \r\n  the restricted area of the track, whether authorized to be there or not.Â  Any \r\n  person who somehow gained unauthorized access to the restricted area would then \r\n  be released from liability under this provision.Â  â€œAn exculpatory agreement \r\n  will be held to contravene public policy if it is so broad â€˜that it would absolve \r\n  [the defendant] from any injury to the [plaintiff] for any reason.â€™â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 121 (quoting College Mobile Home Park &amp; Sales, Inc. v. Hoffmann, \r\n  241 N.W.2d 174, 178 (Wis. 1976)).Â  In Richards, like the present case, \r\n\r\n\r\nthe release does not refer to an injury the plaintiff may \r\n  sustain while riding as a passenger in the specified . . . vehicle . . . [and] \r\n  purports to release the [defendant] from liability for any and all injury to \r\n  the plaintiff while the plaintiff is a passenger in any vehicle (not \r\n  necessarily one owned by the [defendant]) at any time . . . .\r\n\r\nRichards, 513 N.W.2d at 122 (emphasis added).\r\nÂ \r\nAccordingly, this provision is too broad \r\n  to be enforceable against Fisher and is void as against public policy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMoreover, strictly construing this broad provision \r\n  and resolving any doubt in favor of Fisher, it was not the intent of the parties \r\n  to give the contract the effect claimed by Stevens and Poindexter, given the \r\n  release could have plainly stated that Fisher agreed to relieve the wreckerâ€™s \r\n  owner and driver from all liability.Â  See Murray, 172 S.C. at \r\n  402-03, 174 S.E. at 232.Â  The contract did not clearly inform Fisher he would \r\n  be waiving all claims due to Stevensâ€™s and Poindexterâ€™s negligence.Â  See \r\n  Yauger v. Skiing Enters., Inc., 557 N.W.2d 60 (Wis. 1996) (finding an \r\n  exculpatory contract void as against public policy because it did not clearly \r\n  inform the plaintiff he was waiving all claims due to defendantâ€™s negligence).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe cases cited by Stevens and Poindexter \r\n  are distinguishable from the present case.Â  In each case, the plaintiff sued \r\n  the track owners, operators, promoters, or sanctioning body, all of whom are \r\n  parties clearly intended to be covered under waiver and release forms similar \r\n  to the one in this case. [4] Â  Moreover, none of the cases cited exempted \r\n  a defendant from liability based on the broad â€œcatch-allâ€ phrase relied on by \r\n  Stevens and Poindexter.Â  \r\nThe trial judge correctly determined the \r\n  Release did not bar Fisher from recovering against Poindexter and Stevens.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s partial grant of summary judgment.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Denial of \r\n  Speedwayâ€™s Motion for Summary Judgment\r\nSpeedway argues the trial court erred \r\n  in finding the release did not bar Fisherâ€™s claims as a matter of law.Â  The \r\n  trial court denied Speedwayâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact concerning whether a master/servant relationship existed \r\n  between Fisher and Speedway.Â  \r\nWe decline to address the merits of this issue.Â  \r\n  The denial of a motion for summary judgment is not directly appealable, even \r\n  after final judgment.Â  Olson v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3666\r\nHeard April 9, 2003 â€“ Filed July 21, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChief Appellate Defender Daniel T. Stacey, of SC Office of \r\n  Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Duane Dykes White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.: Dedric Thomason pled guilty \r\n  to two counts of resisting arrest in violation of South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 16-9-320 (Supp. 2001).Â  During sentencing, Thomason moved to withdraw \r\n  his guilty pleas, and the circuit court denied his motion.Â  On appeal, Thomason \r\n  contends the circuit court erred by refusing his request to withdraw his pleas \r\n  because the state failed to abide by a plea agreement.Â  Additionally, Thomason \r\n  argues we should reverse his sentences because they resulted from the courtâ€™s \r\n  bias and prejudice.Â  We affirm.Â \r\nFACTS\r\nA Greenville County grand jury returned a two-count \r\n  indictment against Thomason.Â  Each count charged him with resisting arrest involving \r\n  an assault on a law enforcement officer in violation of section 16-9-320(B).Â  \r\n  Thomason pled guilty to one count, and on the remaining count, he pled to the \r\n  lesser-included offense of resisting arrest under section 16-9-320(A).Â  Neither \r\n  Thomason nor the state advised the circuit court of any plea negotiations or \r\n  agreement.Â  The state recommended probation.Â  Â Â \r\nThe circuit court questioned Thomason to determine \r\n  if he understood the nature of the offenses, the possible punishments, and the \r\n  rights he would be waiving.Â  Thomason confirmed no promises had been made to \r\n  induce his guilty pleas.Â  During this questioning, neither the state nor Thomasonâ€™s \r\n  attorney alerted the circuit court to any plea agreement.\r\nHaving determined Thomasonâ€™s pleas were knowingly, \r\n  intelligently, and voluntarily entered, the circuit court accepted them, stating:Â  \r\n  â€œAll right.Â  Iâ€™ll accept his plea if the State gives me a substantial factual \r\n  basis for it.â€Â  The state then presented a limited summary of the facts and \r\n  recommended probation.Â  Thomason did not argue the summary was legally insufficient \r\n  to support the charges.Â  \r\nHearing the recommendation of probation, the circuit \r\n  court immediately advised Thomason, his attorney, and the state, the circuit \r\n  court was not bound by any recommendation and would be the sole judge of the \r\n  sentences to be imposed.Â  Thomasonâ€™s attorney acknowledged this fact and did \r\n  not mention a plea agreement to the circuit court.Â  \r\nThomasonâ€™s attorney then gave a factual presentation \r\n  in mitigation of the offenses, shifting blame for the incident to the arresting \r\n  law enforcement officers.Â  Hearing this, the circuit court asked if the solicitor \r\n  notified the officers regarding the pleas and the recommendation of probation.Â  \r\n  When the solicitor could not confirm the officers had been notified, the circuit \r\n  court recessed the hearing and summoned the officers to appear. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nThomason then moved to withdraw his guilty pleas, arguing, \r\n  for the first time, he had a plea agreement with the state limiting the stateâ€™s \r\n  factual presentation.Â  Thomason claimed allowing the officers to present controverted \r\n  facts would violate the plea agreement to his prejudice because he could not \r\n  contest their version of events in a guilty plea as he could through cross-examination \r\n  in a trial.Â  \r\nÂ  The circuit court refused to allow Thomason to \r\n  withdraw his pleas and resumed the sentencing when one of the two officers appeared.Â  \r\n  As Thomason feared, the officer presented facts adverse to Thomason and confirmed \r\n  he had not been notified of the guilty pleas or the solicitorâ€™s proposed recommendation \r\n  of probation.Â  \r\nFollowing the officerâ€™s presentation, Thomason \r\n  again moved to withdraw his pleas.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, opining \r\n  Thomasonâ€™s attorney and the state had misled the circuit court in the factual \r\n  presentation.Â  The circuit court rejected the recommendation of probation and \r\n  sentenced Thomason to one-year imprisonment for resisting arrest under subsection \r\n  (A) and six years imprisonment for resisting arrest with assault under subsection \r\n  (B).Â  Thomason appeals.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   \r\n      Was Thomason entitled to withdraw his guilty pleas as a matter of right \r\n  before the circuit court imposed sentence? \r\n   \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp; \r\n   \r\n      Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Thomason \r\n  to withdraw his guilty pleas based on the stateâ€™s breach of a plea agreement? \r\n   \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   \r\n      Was Thomasonâ€™s sentence a result of the circuit courtâ€™s bias and prejudice \r\n  resulting from anger at Thomasonâ€™s counsel? \r\n   \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Was Thomason entitled to withdraw his guilty \r\n  pleas as a matter of right before the circuit court imposed sentence?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThomason argues he was entitled to withdraw his guilty pleas \r\n  as a matter of right.Â  We disagree.Â \r\nâ€œAll that is required before a plea can be accepted is that \r\n  the defendant understand the nature and crucial elements of the charges, the \r\n  consequences of the plea, and the constitutional rights he is waiving, and that \r\n  the record reflect a factual basis for the plea.â€Â  Rollison v. State, \r\n  346 S.C. 506, 511, 552 S.E.2d 290, 292 (2001).\r\nA guilty plea may not be accepted unless it is voluntarily \r\n  and understandingly made.Â  Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969); \r\n  State v. Lambert, 266 S.C. 574, 577-78, 225 S.E.2d 340, 341-42 (1976).Â  \r\n  However, once a defendant enters a guilty plea, whether to allow withdrawal \r\n  of the plea is left to the sound discretion of the circuit court.Â  State \r\n  v. Riddle, 278 S.C. 148, 150, 292 S.E.2d 795, 796 (1982).\r\nThomason acknowledged he was guilty of the charges \r\n  and was voluntarily pleading guilty.Â  The circuit court questioned him to determine \r\n  whether the pleas were knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered. At \r\n  that stage, the circuit court stated it accepted the pleas pending presentation \r\n  of the facts by the state.Â  Thomason did not then move to withdraw his pleas.Â  \r\n  Next, the state presented facts legally sufficient to support the charges and \r\n  recommended probation.Â  Again, Thomason did not move to withdraw the pleas and \r\n  raised no objection to the sufficiency of the factual presentation given by \r\n  the state.Â  Thomason then began to discuss sentencing issues with the court.Â  \r\n  Under the authority of State v. Cantrell, 250 S.C. 376, 158 S.E.2d 189 \r\n  (1967), and State v. Barton,Â  325 S.C. 522, 481 S.E.2d 439 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997), we conclude the circuit court accepted Thomasonâ€™s guilty pleas and whether \r\n  to allow withdrawal rested within the sound discretion of the circuit court.\r\nIn Cantrell, a case factually similar to this case, \r\n  the defendant entered guilty pleas, which the circuit court accepted.Â  During \r\n  the preliminary stages of sentencing, the circuit court began to review the \r\n  defendantâ€™s prior statement to police.Â  In the statement, the defendant admitted \r\n  multiple prior offenses.Â  Based on this information, the circuit court indicated \r\n  it was not inclined to give a probationary sentence, whereupon the defendant \r\n  moved to withdraw his plea.Â  250 S.C. at 378, 158 S.E.2d at 190-91.\r\nUpholding the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny the motion to \r\n  withdraw the pleas, the supreme court noted a guilty plea â€œis a confession of \r\n  guilt made in a formal manner and is equivalent to and as binding as a conviction \r\n  after a trial on the merits.Â  It has the same effect in law as a verdict of \r\n  guilt and authorizes the imposition of the punishment prescribed by law.â€Â  Cantrell, \r\n  250 S.C. at 379, 158 S.E.2d at 191.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n accused is not permitted \r\n  to speculate on the supposed clemency of the judge and enter a plea of guilty \r\n  with the right to retract it if he finds that his expectation was not realized.â€ \r\n  Id. at 380, 158 S.E.2d at 192-93.Â  Thus, under those circumstances, our \r\n  supreme court ruled the decision to deny withdrawal of the plea rested within \r\n  the sound discretion of the circuit court.Â  \r\nIn Barton, the defendant entered his guilty pleas, \r\n  and the circuit court began to impose sentence.Â  Before the circuit court could \r\n  complete the publication of its sentence, Barton interrupted.Â  In a later motion \r\n  for reconsideration, Barton claimed he interrupted to withdraw his guilty pleas.Â  \r\n  Under those circumstances, this Court ruled the guilty pleas were entered, and \r\n  the proceeding entered the sentencing phase at the time of Bartonâ€™s interruption.Â  \r\n  Therefore, refusal to allow withdrawal of the accepted pleas was limited to \r\n  review for abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 525-28, 481 S.E.2d at 441-42.\r\nBased on this record, we conclude the guilty pleas in this \r\n  case were clearly accepted by the circuit court.Â  Thus, once the state completed \r\n  its recitation of the facts, the hearing entered the sentencing phase, and no \r\n  further ruling was required to accept the guilty pleas.Â  See Boykin, \r\n  395 U.S. at 242; Rollison, 346 S.C. at 511, 552 S.E.2d at 292; Cantrell, \r\n  250 S.C. at 380, 158 S.E.2d at 191; Barton, 325 S.C. at 531, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  at 443-44.Â  Therefore, whether to allow Thomason to withdraw his guilty pleas \r\n  was a matter resting within the sound discretion of the circuit court, and Thomason \r\n  could not withdraw his pleas as a matter of right.Â  See Riddle, \r\n  278 S.C. at 150, 292 S.E.2d at 796.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in \r\n  refusing to allow Thomason to withdraw his guilty pleas based on the stateâ€™s \r\n  breach of a plea agreement?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThomason argues he was entitled to withdraw his guilty \r\n  pleas because the state breached the terms of a plea agreement.Â  Thomason contends \r\n  the plea agreement required the state to notify the officers and ensure their \r\n  accord with the stateâ€™s factual presentation and proposed disposition.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, the circuit court may conduct \r\n  an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information \r\n  it may consider or the source from which the information may come, to assist \r\n  it in determining the sentence to be imposed.Â  State v. Gulledge, 326 \r\n  S.C. 220, 228, 487 S.E.2d 590, 594 (1997); Cantrell, 250 S.C. at 380, \r\n  158 S.E.2d at 191 (holding when sentencing a convicted defendant, a circuit \r\n  court exercises a wide discretion regarding the sources and types of evidence \r\n  it may use to assist it in determining the kind and extent of punishment to \r\n  be imposed).Â  As noted in Gulledge, â€œ[i]n a sentencing proceeding, evidentiary \r\n  rules are inapplicable[,]â€ and the court may consider inadmissible evidence, \r\n  so long as the information is relevant, reliable and trustworthy.Â  326 S.C. \r\n  at 228, 487 S.E.2d at 594.\r\nFurthermore, the circuit courtâ€™s inquiry into notification \r\n  of the victims is appropriate, as is providing an opportunity for the victims \r\n  to be heard during sentencing.Â  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 24. \r\nThomason argues the state agreed to limit the factual \r\n  presentation to those statements contained in the solicitorâ€™s factual presentation.Â  \r\n  Thus, Thomason contends allowing the officer to present his version of the events \r\n  violated the plea agreement and prejudiced him by limiting his ability to cross-examine \r\n  the witnesses.Â  However, no such plea agreement was divulged to the court prior \r\n  to the acceptance of the guilty pleas.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOur supreme court has recognized a plea agreement rests \r\n  on contractual principles.Â  State v. Gates, 299 S.C. 92, 94-95, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  886-87 (1989); see also Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, \r\n  262 (1971) (â€œ[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement \r\n  of the prosecutor . . . such promise must be fulfilled.â€); Alston v. State, \r\n  379 A.2d 754, 757 (Md. 1978) (â€œWhen the Stateâ€™s Attorney has given his word \r\n  in the form of a plea bargain and that bargain is accepted by the trial court, \r\n  it behooves the Stateâ€™s Attorney to make every reasonable effort to correct \r\n  any deviation from the bargain when the deviation is called to his attention.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, plea agreements will only be reviewed when \r\n  they are clearly delineated on the record.Â  In Thrift, our supreme court \r\n  ruled:\r\n\r\nToday, the complexity of cases dictates that a reliable \r\n  record exist containing the specific terms of any plea agreement.Â  We hold, \r\n  therefore, that effective with this decision, all plea agreements must be on \r\n  the record and must recite the scope, offenses, and individuals involved in \r\n  the agreement.Â  We also hold that prospectively for all plea agreements entered \r\n  after the filing of this opinion, we will limit our review of a plea agreement \r\n  only to those terms which are fully set forth in the record . . . .Â  [Furthermore,] \r\n  neither the State nor the defendant will be able to enforce plea agreement terms \r\n  which do not appear on the record before the trial judge who accepts the plea.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n312 S.C. at 295-96, 440 S.E.2d at 348-49. \r\nIn this case, there was no written plea agreement in \r\n  the record, and neither party identified an oral plea agreement meeting the \r\n  requirements of Thrift prior to the circuit courtâ€™s acceptance of Thomasonâ€™s \r\n  pleas.Â  Only after the circuit court accepted the pleas and undertook its duty \r\n  to examine all of the pertinent facts necessary to fashion an appropriate sentence \r\n  did Thomason assert, for the first time, there was a plea agreement limiting \r\n  the factual presentation.\r\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude Thomasonâ€™s assertion \r\n  was untimely and did not comply with Thrift.Â  Consequently, we cannot \r\n  review the alleged plea agreement.Â  \r\nIn so holding, we acknowledge our supreme court has \r\n  placed an affirmative, shared duty on circuit court judges and counsel to ensure \r\n  the scope of plea agreements is sufficiently entered on the record.Â  Thrift, \r\n  312 S.C. at 296, 440 S.E.2d at 349.Â  However, in this case, neither the state \r\n  nor Thomason alerted the circuit court to any plea agreement specifically limiting \r\n  the factual presentation given by the state.Â  Under these circumstances, the \r\n  circuit court fulfilled its duty under Thrift by inquiring, prior to \r\n  the acceptance of the pleas, whether any promises had been made to Thomason \r\n  in exchange for his guilty pleas.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Thomasonâ€™s argument that he was prejudiced \r\n  by his inability to cross-examine the witnesses is unavailing because he waived \r\n  his right to cross-examination of the witnesses when he knowingly, voluntarily, \r\n  and intelligently entered his guilty pleas. See Gulledge, 326 \r\n  S.C. at 228, 487 S.E.2d at 594.Â  As noted in Gulledge, the only constraint \r\n  on the information which may be considered by the circuit court at sentencing \r\n  is that it be relevant and have sufficient indicia of reliability.Â  Id.\r\nHaving failed to present an enforceable plea agreement, \r\n  Thomason argues no other basis for his claim the circuit court abused its discretion. \r\n  Â Consequently, we hold there was no abuse.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     Was Thomasonâ€™s sentence a result of the courtâ€™s \r\n  bias and prejudice resulting from anger at Thomasonâ€™s counsel?\r\n  \r\n\r\nThomason argues the circuit court was biased and prejudiced \r\n  against him because the circuit court was angry with his attorney.Â  \r\nDuring sentencing, Thomasonâ€™s attorney twice assured the \r\n  circuit court the solicitor had communicated with the arresting officers about \r\n  the guilty pleas.Â  Thomasonâ€™s attorney then clarified he believed the solicitor \r\n  had contacted the officers as a part of plea negotiations.Â  However, when the \r\n  arresting officer later appeared and denied any knowledge of the guilty pleas \r\n  or the sentence recommendation, the circuit court opined Thomasonâ€™s attorney \r\n  and the solicitor misled it.\r\nOn appeal, Thomason argues this exchange, coupled with the \r\n  lengthy sentence of incarceration, proves the severity of the sentences resulted \r\n  from the circuit courtâ€™s bias and prejudice.Â  We conclude this argument is not \r\n  preserved for appeal.\r\nâ€œGenerally, where bias and prejudice of a trial judge is \r\n  claimed, the issue must be raised when the facts first become known and, in \r\n  any event, before the matter is submitted for decision.â€Â  Butler v. Sea Pines \r\n  Plantation Co., 282 S.C. 113, 122-123, 317 S.E.2d 464, 470 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\n  For an appellate court to review an issue, a contemporaneous objection at the \r\n  trial level is required. State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  869, 873 (1994). â€œ[A]n objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into \r\n  focus the precise nature of the alleged error so it can be reasonably understood \r\n  by the trial judge.â€ State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 411, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  213, 216 (2001).Â  Moreover, a party cannot argue one theory at trial and a different \r\n  theory on appeal.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 \r\n  (1989).\r\nThomason made no motion for recusal. Further, he neither \r\n  objected to the sentence nor moved the circuit court to alter or amend the judgment.Â  \r\n  Thus, this argument is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Hoffman, \r\n  312 S.C. at 393, 440 S.E.2d at 873; Prioleau, 345 S.C. at 411, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  at 216; Bailey, 298 S.C. at 5, 377 S.E.2d at 584; see also \r\n  State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 424 (1999) (holding \r\n  an objection to sentence exceeding the maximum allowable by law does not raise \r\n  a question of subject matter jurisdiction and cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal).Â  \r\nWe recognize there is authority relaxing this rule where \r\n  the tone and tenor of the trial judgeâ€™s remarks are such that any objection \r\n  would have been futile. State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 74, 447 S.E.2d 186, \r\n  187 (1994).Â  However, the record in this case does not support such a conclusion.\r\nThe circuit court explained its policy to listen \r\n  to the facts before sentencing and emphasized sentencing was exclusively within \r\n  the purview of the circuit court.Â  The circuit court gave Thomason an opportunity \r\n  to respond to the officerâ€™s statements and made sure the additional facts had \r\n  been given to Thomason during discovery.\r\nContrary to Thomasonâ€™s assertion that there is \r\n  no other explanation for the harsher sentences imposed, the facts revealed by \r\n  the law enforcement officer were more egregious than the limited version of \r\n  events conveyed by the solicitor. [2] Â  Further, the sentences imposed by the circuit \r\n  court were within the range allowed by law.\r\nThroughout the sentencing proceeding, the circuit \r\n  court remained focused on the facts pertinent to sentencing, responding with \r\n  an appropriate and well-reasoned ruling to each argument raised by counsel.Â  \r\n  The record simply does not reasonably lend itself to the conclusion a timely \r\n  objection would have been futile.Â  Thus, notwithstanding the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  disappointment in the handling of the matter by counsel, we conclude this issue \r\n  was not raised to the circuit court and is not preserved for review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, Thomasonâ€™s sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL, J., and STROM, Acting Judge, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The solicitor who presented the case was substituting for the solicitor \r\n    assigned to handle the case. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The officerâ€™s version revealed he and his partner were called to \r\n    the scene because Thomason was shooting a firearm outside a residence.Â  The \r\n    officer testified Thomason repeatedly ordered his pit bull dog to attack the \r\n    officers as they tried to arrest him.Â  The dog did attack one of the two officers, \r\n    diverting his attention from the arrest.Â  The remaining officer fell to the \r\n    ground with Thomason on top of him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3667","title":"Overcash v.

Thomas Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3667\r\nHeard June 11, 2003 â€“ Filed July 21, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nF. Patrick Hubbard and Fred Walters, both of Columbia, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nJohn M. Mahon, Jr., Robert A. McKenzie, and Gary H. Johnson, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â Â Â  Karl Albert \r\n  Overcash, III, brought this private action for public nuisance against South \r\n  Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (â€œSCE&amp;Gâ€), seeking damages for personal \r\n  injuries he sustained when the boat he was operating collided with a wooden \r\n  dock constructed across a portion of Lake Murray.Â  Overcash alleges the dock \r\n  constituted a public nuisance and his â€œspecialâ€ personal injuries give rise \r\n  to a private cause of action.Â  The circuit court disagreed and granted SCE&amp;Gâ€™s \r\n  motion to dismiss Overcashâ€™s claim for failure to allege facts sufficient to \r\n  constitute a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We reverse and \r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe pertinent facts alleged \r\n  in Overcashâ€™s Complaint may be fairly summarized as follows.Â  SCE&amp;G was \r\n  the owner and project manager of the hydroelectric facility commonly know as \r\n  Lake Murray. Lake Murray is a navigable body of water within the applicable \r\n  statutory definition. [1] \r\nIn 1964, Sarah and Crawford Clarkson purchased \r\n  property on Lake Murray.Â  They constructed a 250 foot long wooden dock from \r\n  their property to a small island located over 100 yards away.Â  SCE&amp;G allowed \r\n  the dock to be built, deeded the island to the Clarksons reserving the sole \r\n  right to enforce covenants to prevent a nuisance or dangerous condition, and \r\n  granted a post-construction permit for the dock.\r\nAs part of its obligations to the Federal Energy \r\n  Regulatory Commission (â€œFERCâ€), SCE&amp;G conducted periodic, routine inspections \r\n  of the Lake Murray shoreline for the purpose of identifying structures built \r\n  in violation of FERC requirements.Â  SCE&amp;G had actual or constructive knowledge \r\n  the Clarksonsâ€™ dock existed and constituted an unlawful obstruction of the navigable \r\n  waterway.\r\nOn the night of July 17, 1999, Overcash was traveling \r\n  home by boat from his job at Lake Murray Marina.Â  His boat collided with the \r\n  dock and he was thrown forward and sustained severe personal injuries.\r\nOvercash brought this action seeking damages against \r\n  SCE&amp;G for the injuries he sustained, alleging, among other things, statutory \r\n  and common law public nuisance.Â  SCE&amp;G moved to dismiss Overcashâ€™s public \r\n  nuisance cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, arguing personal \r\n  injuries are not different in kind from the type of injury suffered or anticipated \r\n  by the public at large from a dock obstructing a navigable stream, and thus, \r\n  a private cause of action for damages based on public nuisance is not permitted.Â  \r\n  The circuit court agreed, concluding Overcash failed to allege facts indicating \r\n  he suffered a â€œspecial injuryâ€ such as would allow him to maintain a private \r\n  action for public nuisance.Â  Overcash appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion to dismiss a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, \r\n  must be based solely on the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.Â  \r\n  The motion will not be sustained if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably \r\n  deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the \r\n  case.Â  Washington v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 404, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  204, 206 (Ct. App. 1999);Â Â  McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 632-33, \r\n  494 S.E.2d 431, 433 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œ[A] judgment on the pleadings is considered \r\n  to be a drastic procedure by our courts.â€Â  Russell v. City of Columbia, \r\n  305 S.C. 86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991).Â  Therefore, pleadings in a case \r\n  should be construed liberally and the trial court and this Court must presume \r\n  all well pled facts to be true so that substantial justice is done between the \r\n  parties.Â  See Justice v. Pantry, 330 S.C. 37, 42, 496 S.E.2d 871, \r\n  874 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Overcash argues personal injury constitutes direct \r\n  and special injury, and the trial court erred in holding that a plaintiff who \r\n  suffers personal injury from colliding with a public nuisance blocking a public \r\n  right of way does not have a right to recover damages for that injury, either \r\n  at common law or pursuant to statute.Â  We agree.\r\nThe argument is deceptively simplistic in its phrasing.Â  \r\n  However, neither this Court nor our supreme court have had occasion to rule \r\n  on the precise question of whether personal injury, standing alone, constitutes \r\n  the type of â€œspecialâ€ or â€œparticularâ€ injury necessary to maintain a private \r\n  action for public nuisance in South Carolina.Â  Likewise, no reported decision \r\n  expressly determines whether, as found by the circuit court, some property right \r\n  must be injured in conjunction with a personal injury so that a personal injury \r\n  may serve as a harm sufficient to allow a private action for public nuisance.Â  \r\n  Finally, no reported decision specifically determines whether the danger of \r\n  colliding with an obstruction erected in a public waterway is a different type \r\n  of harm from that presented to the general public.Â Â  \r\nTo properly address these inquiries we find it necessary \r\n  to explore the historic development and application of nuisance law in this \r\n  state, both generally and particularly as it concerns a private right of action \r\n  for public nuisance.Â  In doing so, we venture, with some amount of consternation, \r\n  into what Dean William Prosser fittingly referred to as the â€œimpenetrable jungle \r\n  . . . which surrounds the word â€˜nuisance.â€™â€Â  W. Page Keeton, Dan B. Dobbs,Â  \r\n  Robert E. Keeton &amp; David G. Owen, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts Â§ \r\n  86 at 616 (5th ed., West 1984).\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Historical \r\n  Overview\r\nIn part, the mystery surrounding the common law of nuisance \r\n  arises because, although the word â€œnuisanceâ€ literally means nothing more than \r\n  harm, injury, inconvenience, or annoyance, the term has at times meant â€œall \r\n  things to all people, and has been applied indiscriminately to everything from \r\n  an alarming advertisement to a cockroach in a pie.â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).\r\nModern American public nuisance law is traceable to the medieval \r\n  English criminal writ of â€œpurpresture.â€Â  See 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries \r\n  on the Laws of England 167 (â€œWhere there is a house erected, or an enclosure \r\n  made, upon any part of the kingâ€™s demesnes, or of an highway, or common street, \r\n  or public water, or such like public things, it is properly called a purpresture.â€).Â Â  \r\n  At the time of its emergence, purpresture was not a tort but rather a criminal \r\n  remedy for infringement on the rights of the Crown (or general public), and \r\n  was enforceable solely by indictment brought pursuant to the police powers of \r\n  the sovereign.Â  Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, Â§ 86 at 617. [2] \r\nThe concept of a mutual sovereign and public right to seek \r\n  redress beyond criminal sanctions for interference with the rights of the general \r\n  public emerged in Sixteenth Century England with a line of cases â€œrecogniz[ing] \r\n  that a private individual who had suffered special damage might have a civil \r\n  action in tort for the invasion of the public right.â€Â  Id. at 618 n.14.Â  \r\n  Seminal among the cases credited with contributing to the development of both \r\n  the â€œspecial injury ruleâ€ and the less stringent â€œdifferent in degree ruleâ€ \r\n  is an â€œanonymousâ€ 1536 Kingâ€™s Bench decision.Â  Y.B. Mich. 27 Hen. 8, f. 26, \r\n  pl. 10 (1536).Â  The 1536 case involved an unnamed plaintiff who alleged the \r\n  defendant obstructed the Kingâ€™s highway in an attempt to prevent the plaintiff \r\n  from traveling from his house to his fields.Â  In a one-sentence opinion, Chief \r\n  Justice Bladwin, writing for the majority, concluded the plaintiff could not \r\n  maintain the action:\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this action does not lie to the plaintiff \r\n  for the stopping of the highway; for the King has the punishment of that, and \r\n  he has his plaint in the [criminal court] and there he has his redress, because \r\n  it is a common nuisance to all the Kingâ€™s [subjects], and so there is no reason \r\n  for a particular person to have an [action on his case]; for if one person shall \r\n  have an action by this, by the same reason every person shall have an action, \r\n  and so he will be punished a hundred times on the same case.\r\n\r\nId., quoted as translated in Denise E. Antolini, \r\n  Modernizing Public Nuisance: Solving the Paradox of the Special Injury Rule, \r\n  28 Ecology L.Q. 755 (2001).Â  In a brief but ultimately significant dissent, \r\n  Justice Fitzherbert opined:\r\n\r\nI agree well that each nuisance done in the Kingâ€™s highway \r\n  is punishable in the [criminal court] and not by an action, unless it be where \r\n  one man has suffered greater hurt or inconvenience than the generality have; \r\n  but he who has suffered such greater displeasure or hurt can have an action \r\n  to recover the damage which he has by reason of his special hurt.\r\n\r\nId. (Fitzherbert, J., dissenting).Â  Thereafter, Justice \r\n  Fitzherbert set forth the following hypothetical which has become legendary \r\n  in the labyrinthine path leading to the modern special injury rule:\r\n\r\nIf one makes a ditch across the highway, and I come riding \r\n  along the way in the night and I and my horse are thrown into the ditch so that \r\n  I have great damage and displeasure thereby, I shall have an action here against \r\n  him who made this ditch across the highway, because I have suffered more damage \r\n  than any other person.Â  So here the plaintiff had more convenience by this highway \r\n  than any other person had, and so when he is stopped he suffers more damage \r\n  because he has to go to his close.Â  Wherefore it seems to me that he shall have \r\n  this action pour ce special matiere [for the special matter], but if \r\n  he had not suffered greater damage than all other suffered, then he would not \r\n  have the action.\r\n\r\nId.Â  As Prosser noted centuries later: â€œIt was Fitzherbert \r\n  who was followed; and with this decision the crime of public nuisance became \r\n  also a tort in any instance in which the plaintiff could show damage which was \r\n  particular to him and not shared in common with the rest of the public.â€Â  William \r\n  L. Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 1005 \r\n  (1966) (footnote omitted).\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Modern \r\n  Development\r\nSimilar to English courts, American courts, including South \r\n  Carolina, continue to employ a broad definition of the term nuisance.\r\nâ€˜Nuisanceâ€™ has . . . variously been defined as â€“\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  conduct that is either unreasonable or unlawful and causes annoyance, inconvenience, \r\n  discomfort, or damage to others.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;that which unlawfully annoys or does damage to others.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  anything that works injury, harm or prejudice to an individual or the public.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;anything which works hurt, inconvenience, or damage on another.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  anything which works or causes injury, damage, hurt inconvenience, annoyance, \r\n  or discomfort to one in the legitimate enjoyment of his or her reasonable rights \r\n  of person or property.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  anything which causes a well-founded apprehension of danger.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  anything that essentially interferes with the enjoyment of life or property.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       -&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  something that is offensive, physically, to the senses, and which, by such offensiveness, \r\n  makes life uncomfortable.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n 58 Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 1 (2002).\r\nWhile numerous distinguishing considerations exist regarding \r\n  what generally constitutes a nuisance, American courts distinguish between private \r\n  and public nuisances in the same manner as was historically employed under English \r\n  common law.Â  â€œThe difference between public and private nuisance does not consist \r\n  in any difference in the nature or character of the nuisance itself, but only \r\n  in the degree, that is, in the extent or scope of its injurious effect.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at Â§ 31 (footnotes omitted).Â  â€œ[A] public nuisance affects the public at large, \r\n  while a private nuisance affects one or a limited number of individuals only.Â  \r\n  In other words, to be considered public, the nuisance must affect an interest \r\n  common to the general public.â€Â  Id. at Â§ 32 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn South Carolina, â€œ[a] public nuisance exists \r\n  whenever acts or conditions are subversive of public order, decency, or morals, \r\n  or constitute an obstruction of public rights.â€ State v. Turner, 198 \r\n  S.C. 487, 495, 18 S.E.2d 372, 275 (1942).Â  Further, to be deemed public, the \r\n  nuisance must affect a number of people.Â  See Morton v. Rawlison, \r\n  193 S.C. 25, 32, 7 S.E.2d 635, 638 (1940) (holding â€œ[a] public nuisance must \r\n  be in a public place or where the public frequently congregateâ€); State v. \r\n  Rankin, 3 S.C. 438, 447 (1872) (â€œWhether it be one or the other [public \r\n  or private] depends upon the extent of its existence.â€); but cf. Bowlin \r\n  v. George, 239 S.C. 429, 434-35, 123 S.E.2d 528, 531 (1962) (â€œ[A] nuisance \r\n  may effect a considerable number of persons in the same manner and yet not be \r\n  a public nuisance.â€ (quoting Woods v. Rock Hill Fertilizer Co., 102 S.C. \r\n  442, 450-51, 86 S.E. 817, 820 (1915))).Â  \r\nBesides the common law governing what constitutes \r\n  a nuisance, certain conduct is statutorily prohibited in South Carolina such \r\n  that a violation of the statute constitutes a nuisance.Â  See, e.g., S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (1987) (providing, in part, â€œ[i]f any person shall obstruct \r\n  any such stream, otherwise than as in Chapters 1 to 9 of this Title provided, \r\n  such person shall be guilty of a nuisance and such obstruction may be abated \r\n  as other public nuisances are by lawâ€).\r\nConforming to the development of English common \r\n  law, American courts have universally held a public nuisance affecting a purely \r\n  public right gives no right of action to an individual unless the individual \r\n  has suffered some particular or special damage.Â  Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton \r\n  on Torts, Nuisance Â§ 90 at 646.Â  Thus, where such a special damage exists, \r\n  the right of the injured individual to bring a tort action for nuisance subsists \r\n  separately from the right of public officials to bring civil actions for nuisance, \r\n  and of states to bring criminal actions against nuisance perpetrators.Â  58 Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 35 (2002).\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  The Special Injury Rule\r\nHaving universally adopted the general concept \r\n  that special injuries will support private rights of action for special damages, \r\n  American courts have found it an entirely more difficult task to determine what \r\n  constitutes â€œspecialâ€ or â€œparticularâ€ damage sufficient to support the private \r\n  tort action for public nuisance.Â  Courts have held a private individual may \r\n  establish standing to bring an action for public nuisance merely by having sustained \r\n  an injury in fact, and the concerns regarding a multiplicity of suits are satisfied \r\n  by any means, such as by way of a class action.Â  See Akau v. Olohana \r\n  Corp., 652 P.2d 1130 (1982).Â  A separate and antiquated view holds it is \r\n  sufficient to show oneâ€™s injury is different in degree only.Â  See Carver \r\n  v. San Pedro, L.A. &amp; S.L.R. Co., 151 F. 344 (C.C.S.D. Cal. 1906).Â  However, \r\n  most jurisdictions, including South Carolina, adhere to the view that the plaintiff \r\n  in such an action must establish damages different in kind, not degree, from \r\n  the damage shared by the general public stemming from the exercise of the same \r\n  rights.Â  See generally Huggin v. Gaffney Dev. Co., 229 S.C. 340, \r\n  92 S.E.2d 883 (1956); Brown v. Hendricks, 211 S.C. 395, 45 S.E.2d 603 \r\n  (1947); 66 C.J.S. Nuisances Â§Â§ 2, 76, 78-79 (1998); Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Torts, Â§ 821C (1979).\r\nAlthough it is clear an individual plaintiff seeking \r\n  to bring a tort suit for public nuisance in South Carolina must establish a \r\n  special injury which is different in kind, not merely in degree from that of \r\n  the general public, we are yet faced with the additional challenge of determining \r\n  the more particular matter of what constitutes an injury different in kind from \r\n  the injury suffered by the general public in the case of an obstruction of a \r\n  public waterway.Â  \r\nOnly a limited body of South Carolina case law \r\n  exists which even tangentially discusses the issue now before us.Â  Unlike other \r\n  jurisdictions, South Carolina has no bright-line rule indicating â€œ[p]ersonal \r\n  injuries are sufficient to show an individualâ€™s peculiar injury as required \r\n  to maintain an action for public nuisance,â€ or stated differently, â€œ[i]njuries \r\n  to a personâ€™s health are by their nature special and peculiar for the purposes \r\n  of maintaining such an action.â€Â  58 Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 252 (2002); \r\n  see also Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 821C (â€œWhen the public nuisance \r\n  causes personal injury to the plaintiff or physical harm to his land or chattels, \r\n  the harm is normally different in kind from that suffered by other members of \r\n  the public and the tort action may be maintained.â€); Prosser, Private Action \r\n  for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. at 1012 (â€œ[T]here can now be no doubt \r\n  that the nuisance action can be maintained where a public nuisance causes physical \r\n  injury.â€); see, e.g., Breeding v. Hensley, 519 S.E.2d 369 (Va. \r\n  1999) (allowing award for personal injuries resulting from bicyclistâ€™s collision \r\n  with trash dumpster left by city workers to obstruct public roadway); Gilmore \r\n  v.

Co., 16 N.W.2d 553 (Minn. 1944) (holding \r\n  injuries sustained due to obstruction of roadway by railroad train or automobile \r\n  held distinct from interference with the public right of travel); Downes \r\n  v. Silvia, 190 A. 42 (R.I. 1937) (reversing grant of demurrer where plaintiff \r\n  sustained injuries after encountering unguarded excavation site on private property \r\n  very near highway); Hammond v. Monmouth County, 186 A. 452 (N.J. 1936) \r\n  (allowing recovery for personal injuries when truck encountered unlighted and \r\n  unguarded excavation site); Baker v. City of Wheeling, 185 S.E. 842 (W. \r\n  Va. 1936) (holding pedestrian injured by falling into an unguarded declivity \r\n  below the end of a blind alley could maintain an action for public nuisance).\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Overcashâ€™s Special Injury\r\nIn this case, the circuit court found Overcashâ€™s accident \r\n  did not constitute an injury different in kind from that suffered by the general \r\n  public.Â  In support of this view, the circuit court reasoned, and SCE&amp;G \r\n  argues on appeal â€œall who forcefully collide with an obstruction face the prospect \r\n  of personal injury whether the obstruction is on a public highway or navigable \r\n  stream.â€Â  We find this rationale untenable.\r\nIn Drews v. E.P. Burton &amp; Co., 76 S.C. \r\n  362, 366-67, 57 S.E. 176, 178 (1907), our supreme court expressly determined, \r\n  when the obstruction of a public waterway was a nuisance, damage to the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  boat arising from a collision with the obstruction constituted a â€œspecial injuryâ€ \r\n  sufficient to maintain a tort action for nuisance.Â  In so holding, the court \r\n  reasoned damages sustained in the collision were a special injury to Drews and \r\n  not a general injury to the public.Â  The court determined the injury common \r\n  to both Drews and the public was the inconvenience resulting from the obstruction \r\n  of the right of way.Â  The sheer possibility a boater might collide with the \r\n  obstruction did not render it a nuisance.Â  Rather, its mere presence in the \r\n  public waterway constituted the public nuisance because it interfered with the \r\n  public right to travel unobstructed along the waterway.Â  Id.\r\nApplying this interpretation to the instant case, \r\n  we hold the circuit court erred in finding Overcashâ€™s injuries were not different \r\n  in kind from those of the general public.Â  We can discern no meaningful distinction \r\n  between the essential reasoning in Drews and the reasoning applicable \r\n  to the facts and circumstances as alleged in this case.Â  Applying the Drews \r\n  analysis, the public is â€œinjuredâ€ by the creation of the illegal obstruction \r\n  in the public waterway, and Overcash sustained injuries of a wholly different \r\n  kind when he collided with the dock. \r\n  [3] \r\nMoreover, we find the discussion in Carey v. \r\n  Brooks, 19 S.C.L. (1 Hill) 146, 147-48 (Ct. App. 1833), both instructive \r\n  and compelling.\r\n\r\nBut if by such nuisance, the party suffer a particular damage, \r\n  as if by stopping up a highway with logs, &amp;c. [sic] his horse throws him, \r\n  by which he is wounded or hurt, an action lies.Â  [B]ut if a highway is \r\n  stopped that a man is delayed in his journey a little while, and by reason thereof, \r\n  he is damnified or some important affair neglected, this is not such special \r\n  damage for which an action on the case will lie; but a particular damage to \r\n  maintain this action, ought to be direct and not consequential; as for instance, \r\n  the loss of his horse [a damage to a property interest], or some corporal \r\n  hurt in falling into a trench on the highway [a personal injury], &amp;c. \r\n  [sic].\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted).Â  \r\n  Clearly, in Carey, the court contemplated the precise situation we face \r\n  in this case.Â  We see no reason to ignore the clear example provided by the \r\n  court.Â  Furthermore, the courtâ€™s reasoning is sound.Â  In the Carey courtâ€™s \r\n  hypothetical, the public nuisance would be the blocking of the highway with \r\n  logs, causing each and every member of the public to be delayed.Â  The special \r\n  injury would be caused if the travelerâ€™s horse threw him into the roadside ditch.Â  \r\n  Likewise, in the present case, the public nuisance was created by building a \r\n  dock across a navigable waterway, causing each and every member of the public \r\n  to be delayed while traveling in Lake Murray.Â  The special injury arose when \r\n  Overcash struck the dock and was injured.\r\nWe further conclude the circuit court erred in \r\n  ruling an injury not incidental to a property interest will not support a private \r\n  action for a public nuisance.Â  The circuit court correctly noted South Carolina \r\n  public nuisance cases addressing the issue of special injury have largely been \r\n  predicated on injury either directly to property or incidental to a property \r\n  interest.Â  However, the circuit court misinterpreted these cases when it concluded \r\n  they limit recovery in nuisance solely to injury to property.\r\nIn its order, the circuit court cited Crosby \r\n  v. S. Ry. Co., 221 S.C. 135, 69 S.E.2d 209 (1952) for the proposition that \r\n  â€œIn order for a private individual to maintain a private action for damages \r\n  caused by a public nuisance, the special injury must involve the property rights \r\n  of the individual, and the public nuisance would then constitute a private nuisance.â€Â  \r\n  However, the plaintiffâ€™s cause of action in that case was founded on the allegation \r\n  that the public nuisance caused a diminution in the value of his land.Â  Id. \r\n  at 138-39, 69 S.E.2d at 210-11.Â  Naturally, it follows that the asserted injury \r\n  different in kind from that of the general public would necessarily involve \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s property rights.Â  Id.Â  However, nothing in Crosby \r\n  or any other authority cited by either the circuit court or SCE&amp;G indicates \r\n  an injury different in kind can exist only in the case of an injury to \r\n  a property interest.\r\nIn this regard, SCE&amp;G posits Teague v. Cherokee \r\n  County Mem. Hosp., 272 S.C. 403, 405, 252 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1979), overruled \r\n  on sovereign immunity grounds by McCall ex rel Andrews v. Batson, \r\n  285 S.C. 243, 247, 329 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1985) for the proposition that South \r\n  Carolina does not recognize a private action founded upon public nuisance when \r\n  only a personal injury results.\r\nIn Teague, the plaintiff brought an action \r\n  based in negligence for injuries she sustained when the heel of her shoe caught \r\n  in a hole in a stairway of a public hospital.Â  When the trial court granted \r\n  a demurrer to the complaint based on sovereign immunity, she re-pled her action \r\n  as one in nuisance.Â  The trial court again granted a demurrer on the grounds \r\n  of sovereign immunity because no allegation of interference with the use of \r\n  or any damage to private property, a necessary element of private nuisance, \r\n  existed in the complaint.Â  On appeal, the plaintiff argued her action was sustainable \r\n  as a private action for personal injuries arising out of a public nuisance.\r\nOur supreme court noted previous decisions had \r\n  stripped governmental immunity from the sovereign if the danger causing the \r\n  harm was in fact a nuisance, but noted this rule had never been extended to \r\n  a claim for personal injuries or death.Â  Speaking of an action for private nuisance, \r\n  the court noted â€œ[t]his position, while admittedly the minority view, is consistent \r\n  with the basic rationale upon which the nuisance exception originated, namely \r\n  as an action to recover for interference with the use or enjoyment of rights \r\n  in land.â€ Id. at 405, 252 S.E.2d at 297.Â  The court then stated: â€œThe \r\n  advantage of this position is indicated by the confusion and inconsistency resulting \r\n  in jurisdictions which have allowed tort actions for personal injuries caused \r\n  by a public nuisance.â€Â  Based upon these observations, SCE&amp;G argues the \r\n  Teague Court refused to recognize a cause of action for personal injuries \r\n  arising out of a public nuisance.Â  We disagree with this analysis.\r\nThe Teague Court noted that on appeal the \r\n  plaintiff portrayed her private cause of action as one for special injuries \r\n  suffered as a result of a public nuisance.Â  However, the court concluded â€œ[e]ven \r\n  if the condition of the hospital stairs rose to the dignity of a nuisance, either \r\n  public or private, which is tenuous at best, the basis of the appellantâ€™s claim \r\n  would still have to rest upon the negligence of the hospital and would require \r\n  suing the hospital in a tort action, which would find no authorization under \r\n  our statutes.â€ Id. at 406, 252 S.E.2d 298.Â  Thus, the court ruled the \r\n  action was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\r\nSignificantly, in reaching this conclusion, the \r\n  court referred to Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. \r\n  L. Rev. at 1003-05, in which Prosser noted the basis for liability for public \r\n  nuisance recognized by the courts has been either the violation of a statute, \r\n  as is alleged by Overcash in this case, or on any one of the three traditional \r\n  tort bases: intent, negligence or strict liability.Â  Unlike in this case, the \r\n  facts as alleged by the plaintiff in Teague were susceptible to only \r\n  negligence as a basis for underlying liability.Â  Otherwise stated, no basis \r\n  existed for claiming the stairway was a public nuisance.Â  Rather, in a light \r\n  most favorable to the plaintiff, only the condition of the staircase \r\n  was claimed as a public nuisance.Â  Thus, as the court recognized, ultimately \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s cause of action sounded in negligence, and was barred by sovereign \r\n  immunity.Â  We do not consider this dictum to be controlling, but in any event, \r\n  we do not interpret the ruling to rest on a conclusion that special injury will \r\n  sustain an action for public nuisance only if it involves damage to property \r\n  interests.\r\nIn the absence of any applicable authority limiting \r\n  special injuries solely to injuries to property interests, we decline to interpret \r\n  the South Carolina caselaw to restrict a private cause of action for public \r\n  nuisance to special property damage claims.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order dismissing Overcashâ€™s cause of action for public nuisance is reversed \r\n  and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (1987) (â€œAll streams which have \r\n    been rendered or can be rendered capable of being navigated by rafts of lumber \r\n    or timber by the removal of accidental obstructions and all navigable watercourses \r\n    and cuts are hereby declared navigable streams and such streams shall be common \r\n    highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of this State as to \r\n    citizens of the United States, without any tax or impost therefor, unless \r\n    such tax or impost be expressly provided for by the General Assembly . . . \r\n    .â€)\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Although the common law of private nuisance found its parentage at \r\n    the same time, it springs from entirely different legal roots.Â  The assize \r\n    of nuisance, introduced in thirteenth century England, was a criminal writ \r\n    affording incidental civil relief as redress for conduct on one personâ€™s land \r\n    resulting in the invasion of the land of another.

McIntosh and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Jimmy Wilds was indicted \r\n  for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK) and petit larceny.Â  The jury \r\n  found him guilty as charged.Â  The judge sentenced him to twenty years, suspended \r\n  to eight years with five years probation for ABIK and thirty days concurrent \r\n  for petit larceny.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 5, 2000, Wilds and Allen Ladd drove a vehicle \r\n  to Millerâ€™s Country Store to steal gasoline.Â  After the men exited the car, \r\n  the storeowner, Clarence Miller, and the cashier, Stanley Tuffill, became suspicious \r\n  and approached the men at the gas pump.Â  Tuffill stood at the front, right corner \r\n  of the car.Â  Miller was standing at the rear of the car.Â  Wilds entered the \r\n  driverâ€™s side of the car as Ladd â€œdove in the passenger side of the car.â€Â  Miller, \r\n  approaching the driverâ€™s side window from the rear, hollered at Wilds, â€œAre \r\n  you going to pay for this gas?â€Â  When Wilds looked at Miller, Miller showed \r\n  him the butt of a gun in his pocket.Â  Wilds immediately sped off, running over \r\n  Tuffill.Â  Tuffillâ€™s belt caught in the brake line, and he was dragged under \r\n  the car about 300 feet before being jarred loose.Â  While Tuffill was under the \r\n  car, Wilds swerved the car as he accelerated.\r\nIn Wildsâ€™ voluntary statement that was \r\n  introduced as evidence at trial, Wilds admitted seeing Tuffill in front of the \r\n  car, saying, â€œ[Tuffill] never said anything but he walked and stood in front \r\n  of the car.â€Â  Wilds acknowledged knowing Tuffill was under the car, â€œAlan was \r\n  screaming the dude was under the car, and the next time I saw him was in my \r\n  rear view mirror when he came out from under the car.Â  I didnâ€™t stop . . . .â€Â  \r\n  Lora Radford, a witness who saw the car speeding away from the store, said the \r\n  men â€œlooked like they were laughing.â€\r\nAt the end of the Stateâ€™s case, Wilds moved for a directed verdict \r\n  on the ABIK charge.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  At the close of evidence, \r\n  Wilds renewed his motion for a directed verdict.Â  The judge again denied the \r\n  motion.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial court is concerned with the existence \r\n  or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight, when ruling on a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002); \r\n  State v. Rosemond, 348 S.C. 621, 626, 560 S.E.2d 636, 639 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce \r\n  evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, \r\n  576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003); State v. Rothschild, 351 S.C. 238, 243, 569 \r\n  S.E.2d 346, 348 (2002).Â  The judge should grant a directed verdict motion when \r\n  the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State \r\n  v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 132, 322 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1984); State v. Horne, \r\n  324 S.C. 372, 379, 478 S.E.2d 289, 293 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, if there is \r\n  any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending \r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly \r\n  submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d \r\n  267, 273 (2002); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 190, 562 S.E.2d 320, \r\n  323 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed \r\n  verdict, this Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in \r\n  the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, \r\n  46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 364, 574 \r\n  S.E.2d 203, 205 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, \r\n  an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State \r\n  v. Venters, 300 S.C. 260, 264, 387 S.E.2d 270, 272-73 (1990); State v. \r\n  Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 232, 522 S.E.2d 845, 853 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilds contends the court erred \r\n  in failing to grant a directed verdict on ABIK based upon the insufficiency \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Specifically, Wilds argues the State did not offer any evidence \r\n  that he acted with malice.\r\nASSAULT AND BATTERY WITH INTENT TO KILL\r\nABIK is an unlawful act of a violent nature to \r\n  the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied.Â  \r\n  Tate v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 427, 570 S.E.2d 522, 527 (2002); Hill \r\n  v. State, 350 S.C. 465, 472, 567 S.E.2d 847, 851 (2002); State v. Tyndall, \r\n  336 S.C. 8, 21, 518 S.E.2d 278, 284-85 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  ABIK comprises all \r\n  the elements of murder except the death of the victim.Â  State v. Foust, \r\n  325 S.C. 12, 14, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1996); State v. Glenn, 328 S.C. 300, \r\n  310, 492 S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct. App. 1997); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 \r\n  (2003) (â€œâ€˜Murderâ€™ is the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either \r\n  express or implied.â€).Â  To be convicted of ABIK, the jury must be satisfied \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that if the victim had died, the defendant would have \r\n  been guilty of murder.Â  State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 396, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  283, 285 (2000); Glenn, 328 S.C. at 310, 492 S.E.2d at 398.\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL\r\nINTENT\r\nFurthermore, ABIK requires the intent to kill.Â  \r\n  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 15, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1996); State v. \r\n  Coleman, 342 S.C. 172, 176, 536 S.E.2d 387, 389 (Ct. App. 2000); State \r\n  v. Glenn, 328 S.C. 300, 310, 492 S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  It is \r\n  adequate if general intent is established; specific intent is not necessary.Â  \r\n  Sutton, 340 S.C. at 396, 532 S.E.2d at 285; Foust, 325 S.C. at \r\n  15, 479 S.E.2d at 51; Coleman, 342 S.C. at 176, 536 S.E.2d at 389.Â  Foust \r\n  inculcates:\r\n\r\nSuch intent may be shown by acts and conduct from which a \r\n  jury may naturally and reasonably infer intent.Â  See State v. Lyons, \r\n  102 N.C. App. 174, 401 S.E.2d 776 (1991); Colbert v. State, 84 Ga. App. \r\n  632, 66 S.E.2d 836 (1951).Â  See also 41 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 195 \r\n  (intent may be shown by acts and conduct of accused and other circumstances \r\n  from which the jury may naturally and reasonably infer intent; evidence of the \r\n  character of the means or instrument used, manner in which it was used, purpose \r\n  to be accomplished, resulting wounds or injuries, etc., are admissible to show \r\n  the intent with which the assault was committed); 41 C.J.S. Homicide \r\n  Â§ 179 (intent to kill may be inferred from the character of the assault, the \r\n  use of a deadly weapon with an opportunity to deliberate, or the use of a dangerous \r\n  or deadly weapon in a manner reasonably calculated to cause death or great bodily \r\n  harm; intent may be inferred when it is demonstrated that the accused voluntarily \r\n  and willfully commits an act, the natural tendency of which is to destroy another's \r\n  life).\r\n\r\n325 S.C. at 16 n.4, 479 S.E.2d at 52 n.4.\r\nII.Â  MALICE\r\nMalice is the wrongful intent to injure \r\n  another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent on doing wrong.Â  Tate \r\n  v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 426, 570 S.E.2d 522, 527 (2002); State v. Kelsey, \r\n  331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998); State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. \r\n  127, 128, 352 S.E.2d 480, 481 (1987).Â  It is the doing of a wrongful act intentionally \r\n  and without just cause or excuse.Â  Tate, 351 S.C. at 426, 570 S.E.2d \r\n  at 527; State v. Bell, 305 S.C. 11, 19, 406 S.E.2d 165, 170 (1991).Â  \r\n  Malice is defined as a formed purpose and design to do a wrongful act under \r\n  the circumstances that exclude any legal right to do it.Â  Hill v. State, \r\n  350 S.C. 465, 472, 567 S.E.2d 847, 851 (2002); State v. Fennell, 340 \r\n  S.C. 266, 275 n.2, 531 S.E.2d 512, 517 n.2 (2000).Â  In its legal sense, it does \r\n  not necessarily â€œimport ill-will toward the individual injured, but signifies \r\n  rather a general malignant recklessness of the lives and safety of others, or \r\n  a condition of the mind which shows a heart regardless of social duty and fatally \r\n  bent on mischief.â€Â  Id.; accord State v. Mouzon, 231 S.C. \r\n  655, 622, 99 S.E.2d 672, 675-76 (1957).Â  To prove recklessness or negligence, \r\n  the State is prohibited from relying on the termsâ€™ civil concepts; instead the \r\n  State must look to the meaning of the words as defined in criminal law.Â  State \r\n  v. Rowell, 326 S.C. 313, 317, 487 S.E.2d 185, 187 (1997).\r\nMalice may be either express or implied.Â  \r\n  â€œThe words â€˜express or impliedâ€™ add nothing to the meaning of the word â€˜malice.â€™Â  \r\n  They do not imply different kinds of malice, but merely the manner in which \r\n  the only kind known to the law may be shown to exist--that is, either by positive \r\n  evidence or by inference.â€Â  State v. Milam, 88 S.C. 127, 130, 70 S.E. \r\n  447, 449 (1911).Â  Express malice is when there is a deliberate intention to \r\n  unlawfully take the life of another.Â  40 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 34 (1991).Â  \r\n  Implied malice is when circumstances demonstrate a â€œwanton or reckless disregard \r\n  for human lifeâ€ or â€œa reasonably prudent man would have known that according \r\n  to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would \r\n  follow the contemplated act.â€Â  Id. at Â§ 35.\r\nAlthough malice must be aforethought, there is \r\n  no requirement that it must exist for any appreciable length of time before \r\n  the commission of the act.Â  State v. Cooper, 212 S.C. 61, 66, 46 S.E.2d \r\n  545, 547 (1948); State v. Ballington, 346 S.C. 262, 272, 551 S.E.2d 280, \r\n  285 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting State v. Fuller, 229 S.C. 439, 446, 93 S.E.2d \r\n  463, 467 (1956)).Â  It may be conceived at the very moment the assault occurs.Â  \r\n  Cooper, 212 S.C. at 66, 46 S.E.2d at 547 (quoting Milam, 88 S.C. \r\n  at 131, 70 S.E. at 449).\r\nPermissive Inference of Malice\r\nThe use of a deadly weapon gives \r\n  rise to a permissive inference of malice.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. \r\n  50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998); State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, \r\n  248, 471 S.E.2d 689, 697 (1996); State v. Mattison, 276 S.C. 235, 238, \r\n  277 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1981).Â  In South Carolina, an automobile is regarded as \r\n  a dangerous instrumentality.Â  Yaun v. Baldridge, 243 S.C. 414, 419, 134 \r\n  S.E.2d 248, 251 (1964); State v. Caldwell, 231 S.C. 184, 188, 98 S.E.2d \r\n  259, 261 (1957); State v. Sussewell, 149 S.C. 128, 145, 146 S.E. 697, \r\n  703 (1929); In re McFadden, 112 S.C. 258, 261, 99 S.E. 838, 839 (1919).Â  \r\n  The jury may draw an inference of malice from proof of the use of a deadly weapon \r\n  if it concludes such is proper after considering all of the facts and circumstances \r\n  in evidence.Â  Mattison, 276 S.C. at 239, 277 S.E.2d at 600.Â  In a charge \r\n  to the jury, the judge should make clear to the jury that it is free to accept \r\n  or reject the permissive inferences depending on its view of the evidence.Â  \r\n  State v. Peterson, 287 S.C. 244, 247, 335 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1985), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 405 S.E.2d 315 \r\n  (2001); see State v. Pilgrim, 320 S.C. 409, 415 n.3, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  108, 112 n.3 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œWhile the evidence in this case may give rise \r\n  to an inference the attack was committed with malice and intent to kill, the \r\n  inference is a permissive one which the jury is free to accept or reject.â€), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 \r\n  S.E.2d 50 (1996).Â Â  The supreme court has enunciated a proper jury charge:\r\n\r\nThe law says if one intentionally kills another with a deadly \r\n  weapon, the implication of malice may arise. If facts, are proved beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt, sufficient to raise an inference of malice to your satisfaction, this \r\n  inference would be simply an evidentiary fact to be taken into consideration \r\n  by you, the jury, along with other evidence in the case, and you may give it \r\n  such weight as you determine it should receive.\r\n\r\nState v. Elmore, 279 S.C. 417, 421, 308 \r\n  S.E.2d 781, 784 (1983), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. 45, 405 S.E.2d 315 (2001).Â  The court cautioned the Bench that only \r\n  slight deviations from the given charge would be acceptable.Â  Id.\r\nViewing the evidence and all reasonable \r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the State, we find that the jury could \r\n  infer that Wilds acted with malice aforethought.Â  Because an automobile has \r\n  been deemed a dangerous instrumentality, the jury was allowed to draw a permissive \r\n  inference of malice.Â  Furthermore, Wilds, in his statement, declared seeing \r\n  Tuffill standing in front of his car before he drove away.Â  Evidence was presented \r\n  that Wilds was swerving while accelerating and laughing as Tuffill was dragged \r\n  underneath the automobile.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the judge did not err in failing to grant a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
