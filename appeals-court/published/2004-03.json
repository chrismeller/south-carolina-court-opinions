Ellis, individually and on behalf of American \r\n  Survey, Inc., appeals from the trial judgeâ€™s grant of partial summary judgment \r\n  to Respondents.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the spring of 1998, Ellis, a licensed surveyor, \r\n  decided to start his own residential surveying company.Â  Ellis contacted Rusty \r\n  Bennett, a partner at the law firm of Davidson &amp; Bennett (the Firm) because \r\n  he needed an investor.Â  Ellis had performed prior survey work for the Firm.Â  \r\n  According to Ellis, Bennett agreed to invest in the company and stated:\r\n\r\nThat he would handle all of the legal paperwork and make \r\n  sure that the company was set up properly and that [Ellisâ€™s] rights were protected. \r\n  . . . [Bennett] said he would cover all legal advice involving [Ellis] and the \r\n  company, for [Ellis] not to worry about anything other than producing surveys.\r\n\r\nEllis believed that, in having the Firm invest \r\n  in the business, he would be able to perform work for the Firm and have the \r\n  Firm set up the surveying company in such a way that he was protected from liability.Â  \r\n  After Bennett invested, the business ownership was: Bennett â€“ 60%; Ellis â€“ 40%; \r\n  the 1000 shares of common stock would be divided proportionally, with no restrictions \r\n  placed upon them; Bennett would â€œset upâ€ the surveying company; and Ellis would \r\n  be employed by the surveying company.Â  Other than proposed business plans, no \r\n  written contracts or documents memorialize the agreement between Ellis and Bennett.Â  \r\n  The parties created American Survey, Inc. (American).Â  Bennett set up the company \r\n  and arranged for American to lease space in a building he owned.Â  At some point, \r\n  Bennettâ€™s law partner in the Firm, Eric Davidson, became a shareholder in American.Â  \r\n  Ellis claimed that, in January of 1999, he â€œwas told [the new percentage of \r\n  ownership] was one-third, one-third, one-third.â€Â  Bennett professed he â€œbelieve[d] \r\n  . . . the agreement . . . was that [he and Davidson] would hold 65 percent of \r\n  the shares and [Ellis] would have 35 percent of the shares.â€ \r\n  [1] \r\nSeveral months later, Bennett retired from \r\n  the practice of law and sold his interest in the Firm and the Firmâ€™s businesses \r\n  (including American) to his three partners: Davidson, Jarrell Wigger, and Mark \r\n  Weeks (hereinafter, â€œthe Firmâ€).Â  After Bennettâ€™s retirement, the Firm instructed \r\n  Ellis not to sign a new lease with Bennett.Â  The Firm met with Ellis after discovering \r\n  Bennett never filed Americanâ€™s corporate papers.Â  In fact, Bennett never kept \r\n  corporate minutes, records, or by-laws for American.Â  Ellis testified the members \r\n  of the Firm told him they were acting as attorneys for the corporation, and \r\n  that he should sign the papers as instructed. \r\nEllis and the Firm soon disagreed over the way \r\n  Ellis operated American.Â  At a meeting in March of 1999, Ellis told the Firm \r\n  he wanted to buy out their interest in American.Â  After offers and counteroffers \r\n  were made and rejected, the parties came to a verbal agreement about the buyout.Â  \r\n  The agreement was put into writing, and Ellis and Davidson faxed revisions back \r\n  and forth.Â  While admitting the buyout negotiations were â€œa matter strictly \r\n  of business,â€ Ellis stated the Firm did not advise him to obtain separate counsel, \r\n  and that he thought the Firm acted as attorneys on behalf of both American and \r\n  himself.Â  The agreement was not finalized, as Ellis wanted a written commitment \r\n  from the Firm that American would still continue to be used as the Firmâ€™s chief \r\n  surveying company.Â  In order to force a decision, Ellis informed the Firm that \r\n  he would close Americanâ€™s doors and terminate its employees if the Firm did \r\n  not agree to his terms.Â  The Firm then decided to close American themselves.Â  \r\n  They arrived at American with deputy sheriffs, terminated the employees, and \r\n  changed the locks.\r\nAt approximately the same time Ellis and the Firm \r\n  were in the midst of buyout discussions, the Firm decided to form a new surveying \r\n  company. Members of the Firm testified the new company, Absolute Survey Inc. \r\n  (Absolute), would be run by Kelly Davis and would perform surveying for the \r\n  Firm after Ellis bought their interests in American.Â  Ellis declared that, while \r\n  he was aware of Absoluteâ€™s formation, he did not realize it would be a competing \r\n  surveying company.\r\nOn behalf of American and in his individual capacity, Ellis filed \r\n  an amended complaint against the Firm (including the lawyers in their individual \r\n  capacities), American, Absolute, and Davis.Â  Ellis alleged various causes of \r\n  action, including breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, conversion, and \r\n  civil conspiracy.Â  The Firm and the lawyers in their individual capacities answered, \r\n  counterclaimed, and moved for summary judgment.Â  Additionally, the Firm asked \r\n  for summary judgment for Davis as to all claims against him.\r\nThe Circuit judge granted the Firmâ€™s summary judgment motion as to the causes \r\n  of action for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The judge denied \r\n  the motion for summary judgment as to the remaining causes of action.Â  Further, \r\n  the judge granted summary judgment in Davisâ€™s favor as to all causes of action \r\n  against him.Â  The judge denied Ellisâ€™s subsequent motion for reconsideration.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial judge err in classifying the relationship that existed between \r\n  the parties?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.\r\n        Did the trial judge err\r\n          in â€œdiscountingâ€ the expert witness affidavit?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial judge err in dismissing Kelly Davis as a party?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Laurens \r\n  Emergency Med. Specialists v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 375 (2003); Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 \r\n  (2002); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003); Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. \r\n  Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003); Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., \r\n  353 S.C. 449, 578 S.E.2d 711 (2003); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, \r\n  499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, \r\n  355 S.C. at 108, 584 S.E.2d at 377 (stating that in reviewing summary judgment \r\n  motion, facts and circumstances must be viewed in light most favorable to non-moving \r\n  party).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Baril \r\n  v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to \r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, \r\n  N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 578 S.E.2d 329 (2003); Regions Bank, 354 S.C. \r\n  at 659, 582 S.E.2d at 438; Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 340, 559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001); Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  All ambiguities, \r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most \r\n  strongly against the moving party.Â  Schmidt v. Courtney, Op. No. 3719 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 22, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 66); Bayle \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001); see also Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., \r\n  349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002) (â€œOn appeal from an order granting \r\n  summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to \r\n  the non-moving party below.â€).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of \r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Brockbank v. \r\n  Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000); Bayle, 344 \r\n  S.C. at 120, 542 S.E.2d at 738.Â  Summary judgment should not be granted even \r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is disagreement concerning \r\n  the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary \r\n  Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000).Â  However, when plain, \r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, \r\n  summary judgment should be granted.Â  Hedgepath, 348 S.C. at 355, 559 \r\n  S.E.2d at 336; Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).\r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary judgment has the initial \r\n  burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Regions \r\n  Bank, 354 S.C. at 659, 582 S.E.2d at 438; Trivelas v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Once the \r\n  party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence \r\n  of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest \r\n  on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank, \r\n  354 S.C. at 660, 582 S.E.2d at 438.Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward \r\n  with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  SSI Med. \r\n  Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990); Peterson v. \r\n  West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of \r\n  cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, \r\n  354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 868 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Relationship \r\n  Between the Parties\r\n\r\nA.Â  Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\nEllis argues the trial judge erred in finding there was no evidence of a fiduciary \r\n  duty between the Firm and Ellis and/or American.Â  We agree.\r\nA fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust \r\n  and confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.Â  \r\n  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003); \r\n  Redwend Ltd. Partnership v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003); Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, 368 S.E.2d 91 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988).Â  A fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special \r\n  confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is \r\n  bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one imposing \r\n  the confidence.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  711 (2003); Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 416 S.E.2d 629 (1992); SSI \r\n  Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990); Regions \r\n  Bank, 354 S.C. at 670, 582 S.E.2d at 444; Steele, 295 S.C. at 293, \r\n  368 S.E.2d at 93.Â  A relationship must be more than casual to equal a fiduciary \r\n  relationship.Â  Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 670, 582 S.E.2d at 444; Steele, \r\n  295 S.C. at 293, 368 S.E.2d at 93.\r\nAs a general rule, a fiduciary relationship cannot be created by \r\n  the unilateral action of one party.Â  Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 670, 582 \r\n  S.E.2d at 444; Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 483 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).Â  To establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship, the facts and \r\n  circumstances must indicate the party reposing trust in another has some foundation \r\n  for believing the one so entrusted will act not in his own behalf but in the \r\n  interest of the party so reposing.Â  Burwell v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, \r\n  288 S.C. 34, 340 S.E.2d 786 (1986).Â  The evidence must show the entrusted party \r\n  actually accepted or induced the confidence placed in him.Â  Regions Bank, \r\n  354 S.C. at 671, 582 S.E.2d at 444; State v. Parris, 353 S.C. 582, 578 \r\n  S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2003); Brown, 326 S.C. at 423, 483 S.E.2d at 484.\r\nWe find there are genuine issues of material fact as \r\n  to whether a fiduciary duty existed between the Firm and Ellis, in his individual \r\n  and representative capacities.Â  There is evidence that Ellis relied upon the \r\n  Firmâ€™s legal expertise and reposed a â€œtrust and confidenceâ€ in the Firm in their \r\n  joint business dealings.Â  The Firm had always tendered legal advice to Ellis, \r\n  even after American was set up.Â  For example, Davidson instructed Ellis to speak \r\n  to Wigger about an American employee who was injured in the course of his employment.\r\nWe rule that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether \r\n  the Firm breached a fiduciary duty in its treatment of Ellis, both in his individual \r\n  and representative capacities.Â  We disagree with the judgeâ€™s finding that any \r\n  such duty ended with the formation of American.Â  Bennett was integral to the \r\n  process of structuring and incorporating American.Â  When asked who â€œhad the \r\n  responsibility of handling all of the legal work with the formation of American,â€ \r\n  Bennett responded: â€œThat would have been me or our firm.â€Â  According to Ellis, \r\n  even after American was set up and Bennett left the Firm, the remaining members \r\n  of the Firm told Ellis they were acting as Americanâ€™s attorneys.Â  When queried \r\n  regarding whether he or the Firm gave advice to Ellis personally or to American, \r\n  Weeks answered: â€œAmerican Survey.â€Â Â Â Â  The Firm instructed Ellis about: (1) \r\n  breaking Americanâ€™s lease in Bennettâ€™s building and (2) following their advice \r\n  in signing papers to properly incorporate American.Â  In fact, when the parties \r\n  were engaged in buyout negotiations, Ellis testified he did not obtain separate \r\n  counsel because he believed the Firm acted as attorneys for both himself and \r\n  American.\r\nWe conclude genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether there was a \r\n  fiduciary duty and, if so, whether such duty was breached.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  trial judge erred in granting summary judgment on this issue.\r\n\r\nB.Â  Attorney-Client Relationship\r\n\r\nEllis contends the trial judge erred in finding there \r\n  was insufficient evidence of an attorney-client relationship between the Firm \r\n  and Ellis and/or American.Â  We agree.\r\nOur courts have recognized the attorney-client relationship is, by \r\n  its very nature, a fiduciary one.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. \r\n  449, 578 S.E.2d 711 (2003); Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  310 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Hotz v.

Piedmont Interstate Fair Assâ€™n, 217 S.C. 38, 59 S.E.2d \r\n  495 (1950) (stating that a fiduciary relationship always exists between attorney \r\n  and client).Â  The relationship between an attorney and a client is highly fiduciary \r\n  in its nature and of a very delicate, exacting and confidential character, requiring \r\n  a high degree of fidelity and good faith.Â  Weatherford, 340 S.C. at 582, \r\n  532 S.E.2d at 315; 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law Â§ 137 (1997).\r\nIn the instant case, the Firm was intricately involved in Americanâ€™s businessâ€”from \r\n  the time of its formation until the Firmâ€™s lockout of the company.Â  Bennett \r\n  drafted the initial incorporation papers for American and, after Bennett left \r\n  the Firm, the remaining Firm attorneys re-drafted and filed Americanâ€™s corporate \r\n  papers.Â  The following colloquy occurred during Ellisâ€™s deposition:\r\n\r\nQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Can you think of any other personal legal advice \r\n  that they have given you?\r\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.Â  At our second meeting at Davidson and Bennett, \r\n  the missing corporate books showed up that were at the James Island office the \r\n  whole time, and Eric stated that Jerry would be going over with me the corporate \r\n  books and what needed to be taken care of.\r\nJerry opened up the books sitting there at the table across from me and said, \r\n  none of this stuff ha[s] been done, all of the forms are blank.Â  That I could \r\n  get sued personally.Â  Mark Weeks jumped up and said, we are one station wagon \r\n  loaded full of kids with a soccer mom going through an intersection and having \r\n  one of our vehicles hit her, and that I could be sued personally and they could \r\n  take everything that I own.\r\nJerry flipped open the book and said, you need to sign here and we get our ass \r\n  offâ€”you need to sign here, you need to sign here.Â  I am sitting there going, \r\n  shit, I had no idea, Rusty was supposed to be taking care of this.\r\nAt the same time they are going, this company is a â€œCâ€ corp., Rusty put the \r\n  screws to us, we should have been a â€œSâ€ corp.Â  Rusty made it a â€œCâ€ corp. to \r\n  protect his ass.Â  That is the only reason Rusty did it.Â  He didnâ€™t give a shit \r\n  about you, Mark.Â  He has this thing as a â€œCâ€ corp.\r\nSign here, sign here, take care of this.Â  I am thinking, the signatures I am \r\n  putting on these blank sheets of paper, if you look, you will see they are not \r\n  only blank, but they are not dated, was to protect me from getting sued.Â  This \r\n  is what they are telling me sitting in that office--\r\nQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Who told you--\r\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  --they are protecting my rights.\r\nQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Who told you that?\r\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Mark Weeks, Jerry Wigger and Eric Davidson, sitting \r\n  in there.\r\nQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  What did you sign?\r\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  I signed every piece of paper they threw in front \r\n  [of] me that they said would cause me to get sued by some soccer mom loaded \r\n  up full of kids.\r\nQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  What were the papers that you signed?\r\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  I signed a bunch of papers.Â  I couldnâ€™t tell you \r\n  the exact one.Â  I tell you how quick it went, you need to sign here, flip, flip, \r\n  you need to sign here, flip, flip, and sign here and sign here, and this is \r\n  going to protect you, Mark, this is going to stop that soccer mom loaded full \r\n  of kids from suing you personally.\r\nQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  You mean by making sure that the corporation was \r\n  duly incorporated, is that what they were telling you?\r\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  What they told me, what Jerry Wigger told me, in \r\n  particular, as I was told from Eric, that he was a business attorney for the \r\n  group, was that a corporation has to act as a corporation.Â  It cannot act as \r\n  just some little fly by night, oh, yeah, we filed some paperwork with the State, \r\n  therefore, we have this corporate veil, we are impenetrable personally by it.\r\nJerry said that is what he did all day long is pierce the corporate veil in \r\n  order to go after personal assets, personal, private assets, and that he was \r\n  protecting me by me signing these documents.\r\n\r\nAfter American was properly formed, the Firm advised Ellis on at least one \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation matter and acted in Americanâ€™s interest in negotiating \r\n  a new lease for Americanâ€™s offices.Â  In addition, the Firm did not advise Ellis \r\n  to obtain outside counsel during the buyout negotiations.\r\nWe conclude there was ample evidence presented to overcome summary judgment \r\n  on this matter.Â  Concomitantly, the trial judge erred in finding there was insufficient \r\n  evidence of an attorney-client relationship.\r\n\r\nC.Â  Legal Malpractice\r\n\r\nEllis maintains the trial judge erred in finding there was no evidence of legal \r\n  malpractice.Â  We agree.\r\nIn order\r\nto prevail in a legal malpractice action, the plaintiff must prove four\r\nelements:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)&nbsp;\r\n        the existence of an\r\n          attorney-client relationship;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;\r\n        a breach of duty by the\r\n          attorney;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)\r\n        &nbsp;damage to the\r\n          client; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (4)\r\n        &nbsp;proximate\r\n          causation of the clientâ€™s damages by the breach.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSmith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp;\r\nGeurard, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612 (1996); Sims\r\nv. Hall, Op. No. 3703 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 8, 2003) (Shearouse Adv.\r\nSh. No. 43 at 60); Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 561 S.E.2d 654 (Ct. App.\r\n2002); Henkel v. Winn, 346 S.C. 14, 550 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 2001); McNair\r\nv. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ellis and American, \r\n  we find there was sufficient evidence presented on the issue of legal malpractice \r\n  to survive the Firmâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Factual issues exist as \r\n  to the (1) buyout negotiations; (2) subsequent lockout of the American offices; \r\n  and (3) Firmâ€™s formation of a rival surveying company, Absolute, in the midst \r\n  of these buyout negotiations.Â  We disagree with the trial judgeâ€™s finding that \r\n  no evidence exists as to damages.Â  The damages Ellis and American suffered in \r\n  this case flowed from the improper formation of American.Â  The Firm did not \r\n  perform several functions, including: issuing stock certificates, holding an \r\n  organizational meeting, writing by-laws, drafting an employment contract for \r\n  Ellis, and preparing documentation that Ellis loaned personal equipment to American.Â  \r\n  If the Firm had drafted these documents, the rights and responsibilities of \r\n  the parties could have been clearly laid out.Â  For example, stock restrictions \r\n  could have been implemented, corporate governance could have been set out, a \r\n  right of first refusal in transferring company stock could have been included, \r\n  and the procedure for valuing and selling American could have been devised and \r\n  agreed upon by the parties.Â  As a result of the Firmâ€™s poor drafting, Ellis \r\n  was not apprised of the proper procedures and methods for governing American.Â  \r\n  He was later literally and figuratively shut out of Americanâ€™s operation.Â  Further, \r\n  as there was no documentation of equipment loaned to American, Ellis lost several \r\n  pieces of personal property when the Firm effected a lockout of the company.Â  \r\n  Finally, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether these damages were \r\n  proximately caused by the Firmâ€™s improper formation of American.\r\nII.Â  Affidavit \r\n  from Expert Witness\r\nEllis asserts the trial judge erred in â€œdiscountingâ€ an affidavit from an expert \r\n  witness.Â  We agree.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony is a matter within the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial court.Â  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  205 (1998); Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 574 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002); Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 558 S.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  A trial courtâ€™s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. \r\n  392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002); Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, \r\n  354 S.C. 445, 581 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2003); State v.

App. 2003); Burroughs, 352 S.C. at 390, 574 \r\n  S.E.2d at 219.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when there is an error of law \r\n  or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  Fontaine v. \r\n  Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 354 S.E.2d 565 (1987); Fields, 354 S.C. at 451, \r\n  581 S.E.2d at 492; Hedgepath v.

App. 1988) (â€œBefore the \r\n  Court of Appeals will reverse a judgment for an alleged error in the exclusion \r\n  of evidence, the appellant must show prejudice.â€).\r\nRule 702, SCRE, articulates guidelines for the admissibility of expert \r\n  testimony.Â  Rule 702 provides: â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized \r\n  knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine \r\n  a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, \r\n  training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  \r\n  Rule 702, SCRE.Â  For a court to find a witness competent to testify as an expert, \r\n  the witness must be better qualified than the fact finder to form an opinion \r\n  on the particular subject of the testimony.Â  Mizell, 351 S.C. at 406, \r\n  570 S.E.2d at 183; Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, \r\n  487 S.E.2d 596 (1997); Crawford v. Henderson, 356 S.C. 389, 589 S.E.2d \r\n  204 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Fields, 354 S.C. at 452, 581 S.E.2d \r\n  at 492 (to be competent as expert, witness must have acquired, by reason of \r\n  study or experience, or both, such knowledge and skill in a business, profession, \r\n  or science that he is better qualified than the fact finder to form an opinion).\r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, Ellis presented an expert affidavit from Gregory \r\n  Adams, a University of South Carolina law school professor and expert on legal \r\n  ethics.Â  Adams concluded the Firm â€œincompetently set upâ€ American and failed \r\n  to properly advise Ellis about several important matters while forming the company.Â  \r\n  Adams opined there was an attorney-client relationship between the parties, \r\n  and that this relationship was subsequently breached by the Firmâ€™s actions.Â  \r\n  Adams noted the Firm engaged in transactions which conflicted with their responsibilities \r\n  to Ellis and American.Â  The trial judge ruled:\r\n\r\n[Adamsâ€™s] affidavit . . . cannot create the requisite factual \r\n  issue because it is based on factual assumptions about advice provided to Plaintiff \r\n  Ellis, which assumptions are not supported by the record in this case. . . . \r\n  [A]s the record establishes that the only potential legal advice provided to \r\n  Ellis was with regard to formation of the corporation and obtaining workerâ€™s \r\n  compensation insurance, Dr. Adamsâ€™ affidavit does not change this Courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that no attorney-client relationship existed between Ellis and the Defendants \r\n  that resulted in any damages alleged in this action.\r\n\r\nThe record supports Adamsâ€™s conclusions in the affidavit, and, when considered \r\n  in conjunction with Ellisâ€™s testimony, presented a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact about the questions of breach of fiduciary duty, the existence of an attorney-client \r\n  relationship, and legal malpractice.Â  As the affidavit was crucial to proving \r\n  the Firm breached a fiduciary duty in their attorney-client relationship with \r\n  Ellis and American, Ellis, in his individual and representative capacities, \r\n  was prejudiced by the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Hall v. Fedor, 349 \r\n  S.C. 169, 561 S.E.2d 654 (Ct. App. 2002) (explaining the client in a legal malpractice \r\n  action must generally establish the standard of care by expert testimony).\r\nThe trial judge abused his discretion in failing to give efficacy \r\n  to the expert witness affidavit.Â  Because this resulted in prejudice to Ellis \r\n  and American, it was error.\r\nIII.Â  Dismissal \r\n  of Davis\r\nEllis argues the trial judge erred in dismissing Kelly Davis from the lawsuit.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn the complaint, Ellis and American included Kelly \r\n  Davis, the surveyor for Absolute, as a party in this action on the grounds of \r\n  civil conspiracy and conversion.Â  The trial judge granted Davisâ€™s motion for \r\n  summary judgment as to all causes of action raised against him.Â  We agree with \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on this issue.\r\n\r\n A.Â  Civil Conspiracy\r\n\r\nA civil conspiracy consists of three elements: (1) a combination \r\n  of two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff; \r\n  (3) which causes the plaintiff special damage.Â  Lawson v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Corrections, 340 S.C. 346, 532 S.E.2d 259 (2000); Robertson \r\n  v. First Union Natâ€™l Bank, 350 S.C. 339, 565 S.E.2d 309 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  Lee v. Chesterfield Gen. Hosp., Inc., 289 S.C. 6, 344 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986).Â  Ellis did not prove Davis engaged in a civil conspiracy with the \r\n  Firm in order to purposely injure either Ellis or American.Â  We find no genuine \r\n  issue of material fact exists in the allegations levied against Davis.Â  Ellis \r\n  proved only that Davis was involved with the Firm in the formation of Absolute, \r\n  not that he undertook this enterprise for the purpose of injuring either Ellis \r\n  or American.Â  Because Ellis could not establish the second element of civil \r\n  conspiracy, the trial judge did not err in granting summary judgment in Davisâ€™s \r\n  favor.\r\n\r\nB.Â  Conversion\r\n\r\nConversion is the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right \r\n  of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration \r\n  of the condition or the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  Regions Bank v. \r\n  Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Davis is not liable \r\n  for Absoluteâ€™s alleged conversion of Americanâ€™s property.Â  Absolute is a corporation.Â  \r\n  Davis may use the disputed equipment but only in his capacity as a surveyor \r\n  employed by Absolute.Â  Ellis and American have not alleged that Davis personally \r\n  gained from the property in question.Â  They aver only that Absolute has benefited \r\n  from it.Â  Even if Davis had believed the property belonged to Ellis or American, \r\n  he would have had no authority to dispose of it without the approval of the \r\n  corporation.Â  In the Appellantsâ€™ brief, Ellis and American assert: â€œDavis is \r\n  the responsible party at Absolute.â€Â  However, Davis is a surveyor for Absolute.Â  \r\n  He is an employee of the corporation and a minority shareholder.Â  This does \r\n  not make him personally liable to Ellis and American for property that Absolute, \r\n  as a corporation, has allegedly converted.Â  The judge properly granted summary \r\n  judgment to Davis.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the foregoing, the trial judgeâ€™s order granting the Firmâ€™s motion \r\n  for partial summary judgment [2]  \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED. [3] \r\n HEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    While Ellis and Bennett disagree over the series of events leading to Davidsonâ€™s \r\n    participation in American, it is clear Davidson was involved early in Americanâ€™s \r\n    formation.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    On remand, the Circuit Court will evaluate all issues separately and distinctly \r\n    in regard to Mark W. Ellis, individually, and American Survey, Inc.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    Ellis alleges the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment while there \r\n    were outstanding motions and discovery in this case.Â  However, as we are reversing \r\n    and remanding this case on several issues, we need not reach this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3749","title":"Goldston v.

Wright, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\nLinda Weeks Gangi, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Cynthia P. Goldston, \r\n  as personal representative to the estate of Neil Bryan Goldston, Sr., appeals \r\n  the special refereeâ€™s ruling in favor of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance \r\n  Company in this declaratory judgment action concerning State Farmâ€™s obligation \r\n  to pay underinsured motorist coverage benefits.Â  We affirm, as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts in this case are undisputed.Â  \r\n  On August 22, 1991, Rickie D. Johnson was driving a pickup truck along a highway \r\n  in Georgetown County, South Carolina.Â  The truck ran off the highway and struck \r\n  Neil Bryan Goldston, Sr., who died from injuries sustained in the collision.Â  \r\n  Johnson was involved in repossessing three vehicles on behalf of his employer, \r\n  American Lenders Service Company of Charleston, Inc., at the time of the accident.Â  \r\n\r\nThe truck driven by Johnson was insured \r\n  under a policy issued by the South Carolina Insurance Company.Â  This policy \r\n  contained liability limits of $100,000 per person.Â  At the time of the accident, \r\n  the truck was titled under the name â€œS.C. Auto Sales &amp; Recovery, by A.M \r\n  Sprague, V.P.â€Â Â Â  S.C. Auto Sales and Recovery is not, and never has been, a \r\n  registered corporation, partnership, or other legal entity.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1974, Sprague formed a South Carolina \r\n  corporation under the name of Southern Recovery Service, Inc., for the operation \r\n  of a â€œcollateral recoveryâ€ or repossession business.Â  By amendment to the articles \r\n  of incorporation, the business was renamed to South Carolina Auto Recovery Services, \r\n  Inc.Â  Sprague was the sole owner and stockholder of this corporation.Â  \r\nIn September 1979, Sprague acquired a \r\n  franchise from American Lenders Service Company of Odessa, Texas (â€œAmerican \r\n  of Texasâ€) for the operation of a collateral recovery business under the name \r\n  American Lenders Service Company of Charleston.Â  From this time forward, the \r\n  business of South Carolina Auto Recovery Services, Inc. was conducted under \r\n  the name of American Lenders Service Company of Charleston.Â  In 1984, Sprague \r\n  and his wife, Linda, created a new South Carolina corporation under the name \r\n  of American Lenders Service Company of Charleston, Inc. (â€œAmerican of Charlestonâ€).Â  \r\n  They are the companyâ€™s sole owners, officers, and directors, and Sprague is \r\n  an employee.Â  All of the operating assets of South Carolina Auto Recovery Service, \r\n  Inc. were transferred to American of Charleston, and South Carolina Auto Recovery \r\n  Service, Inc. was dissolved in June 1985. \r\nAlthough the Spragues have conducted their \r\n  business under the name of American of Charleston since 1979, the trucks used \r\n  to perform their repossession business were both titled and insured under the \r\n  name of S.C. Auto Sales &amp; Recovery.Â  Even trucks purchased after the incorporation \r\n  of American of Charleston were titled and insured under the name of S.C. Auto \r\n  Sales &amp; Recovery.Â Â Â  \r\nAmerican of Charleston paid the purchase \r\n  price of the truck Mr. Johnson was driving at the time of the accident as well \r\n  as all of the insurance, taxes, gas, upkeep, and registration expenses.Â Â  The \r\n  truck is listed as an asset on American of Charlestonâ€™s financial statements, \r\n  and American of Charleston claimed depreciation of the truck on its income tax \r\n  returns.Â Â Â Â  Furthermore, the truck was used to repossess vehicles on behalf \r\n  of American of Charleston, and was being so used at the time of the accident. \r\n\r\nAppellant, the decedentâ€™s \r\n  personal representative, commenced wrongful death and survival actions against \r\n  the driver of the truck, the Spragues d/b/a S. C. Auto Sales and Recovery, American \r\n  of Charleston, American of Texas, and General Motors Acceptance Corporation \r\n  d/b/a GMAC Financial Services.Â  All parties answered denying liability for Goldstonâ€™s \r\n  death.Â  \r\nThe parties reached a settlement in which \r\n  the Appellant received $700,000.Â  The liability insurance carrier on the truck \r\n  involved in the accident, South Carolina Insurance Company, paid its limits \r\n  of $100,000.Â Â Â  The remainder of the settlement was paid by National American \r\n  Insurance Company (â€œNationalâ€).Â  American of Charleston maintained an insurance \r\n  policy with National consisting of a commercial general liability coverage, \r\n  commercial auto coverage, and commercial inland marine coverage, which contained \r\n  limits of $1,000,000.Â  American of Texas, the franchisor of American of Charleston, \r\n  maintained an additional commercial policy with National, which had essentially \r\n  the same commercial general liability coverage, commercial auto coverage, and \r\n  commercial inland marine coverage as the policy issued by National to American \r\n  of Charleston.Â  This policy also contained limits of $1,000,000.Â Â Â  \r\nState Farm, the Respondent, \r\n  issued an automobile insurance liability policy to the decedent, Goldston, which \r\n  contained underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $50,000 per person.Â  \r\n  State Farm consented to the settlement agreement described above, which ended \r\n  both the wrongful death and survival claims against all defendants, while agreeing \r\n  to preserve Appellantâ€™s claim to the underinsured motorist benefits under the \r\n  State Farm policy.Â  State Farm also stipulated that the damages recoverable \r\n  in the actions brought by Appellant exceeded $150,000.Â  \r\nAppellant commenced this declaratory judgment \r\n  action by filing a complaint seeking to determine whether State Farm was under \r\n  an obligation to pay the underinsured motorist benefits contained in the policy \r\n  issued to the decedent.Â  By agreement of the parties, the matter was referred \r\n  to a special referee.Â  After two hearings, the special referee issued an order \r\n  dismissing the action. \r\nThe refereeâ€™s order states the issue to be \r\n  decided was whether the commercial auto coverage or the commercial general liability \r\n  coverage under the National policies issued to American of Charleston and American \r\n  of Texas constitute â€œâ€˜applicable bodily injury liability and property damage \r\n  liability insurance policies or bonds that apply to the bodily injury suffered \r\n  by [the decedent].â€™â€Â Â  \r\nThe significance of this question lies in \r\n  the fact that if the policies constituted liability policies applicable to the \r\n  decedent, then by definition, the vehicle driven by Johnson could not be underinsured \r\n  because these policies would provide coverage in excess of the $150,000 in damages \r\n  stipulated to by the parties.Â  Therefore, Appellant would not be entitled to \r\n  collect the $50,000 in underinsured benefits provided for in State Farmâ€™s policy. \r\n\r\nThe special referee proceeded to make several \r\n  conclusions of law, all of which Appellant argues were in error.Â  First, the \r\n  referee determined that the status of the at-fault vehicle, for purposes of \r\n  the insurance policies issued by National to American of Charleston and American \r\n  of Texas, was that of a â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicle or, in the alternative, a â€œhired \r\n  auto.â€Â  By making this determination, the referee concluded that the commercial \r\n  auto coverage, as defined in the garage coverage form under the policies issued \r\n  by National, provided applicable coverage to satisfy Appellantâ€™s claims.\r\nThe second conclusion of law asserted that, \r\n  regardless of how the court characterized the at-fault vehicle under the National \r\n  policies, coverage existed to pay Appellantâ€™s claims because at the time of \r\n  the accident the vehicle was being used for garage operations.Â  Thus, the special \r\n  referee concluded the vehicle, and by necessity the accident, were covered under \r\n  the commercial auto coverage section of the National policies.Â  In fact, the \r\n  referee went on to state that because the â€œclear and unambiguous language of \r\n  the policy provides coverage for garage operations,â€ and because the driver \r\n  of the truck was performing garage operations at the time of the accident, clearly \r\n  the National policies provided coverage.Â  \r\nThe special refereeâ€™s third conclusion of \r\n  law was that coverage was also available for Appellantâ€™s claims under the commercial \r\n  general liability coverage section of the National policies.Â  Specifically, \r\n  after interpreting the pertinent provisions of the policies, the referee held \r\n  that because there were no applicable exclusions placing the acts of the at-fault \r\n  driver outside the policy, coverage was available under the commercial general \r\n  liability coverage section of the policy. \r\nAppellantâ€™s motion for reconsideration of \r\n  the refereeâ€™s rulings was denied.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the referee err in excluding certain facts from his order of dismissal contained \r\n  in the partiesâ€™ stipulation of facts and relevant to the issues being ruled \r\n  upon?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.\r\n         \r\n  Did the referee err by concluding that the truck operated by Johnson at the \r\n  time of the accident was a â€œnon-owned autoâ€ or, in the alternative, a â€œhired \r\n  autoâ€ for purposes of the commercial auto coverage section of the insurance \r\n  policies issued by National to American of Charleston and American of Texas?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.\r\n         \r\n  Did the referee err in concluding that the commercial auto coverage section \r\n  of the insurance policies issued to American of Charleston and American of Texas \r\n  provided liability insurance to pay the claims of Appellant because Johnson \r\n  was involved in garage operations at the time of the accident?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the referee err in concluding that the commercial general liability coverage \r\n  section of the policies issued to American of Charleston and American of Texas \r\n  provided coverage to pay the claims of Appellant?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         V.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the referee err in failing to conclude that there was a gap in coverage \r\n  between the at-fault vehicle and the policies issued to American of Charleston \r\n  and American of Texas?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         VI.\r\n         \r\n  Assuming coverage existed under the policies issued by National to American \r\n  of Charleston and American of Texas, did the referee err nevertheless in failing \r\n  to conclude that these policies should not be taken into consideration when \r\n  determining whether the vehicle was underinsured for purposes of receiving underinsured \r\n  motorist benefits?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nBecause declaratory judgment \r\n  actions are neither legal nor equitable, the standard of review depends on the \r\n  nature of the underlying issues.Â  Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., \r\n  354 S.C. 274, 279, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n  When the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine if coverage exists \r\n  under an insurance policy, the action is one at law.Â  Horry County v. Ins. \r\n  Reserve Fund, 344 S.C. 493, 497, 544 S.E.2d 637, 639-640 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the \r\n  appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they \r\n  are found to be without evidence that reasonably supports those findings.Â  Townes \r\n  Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 \r\n  (1976).Â  However, â€œâ€˜[w]hen an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, \r\n  an appellate court is free to review whether the trial court properly applied \r\n  the law to those facts.â€™â€Â  In re Estate of Boynton, 355 S.C. 299, 301, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, \r\n  342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000)).Â  In such a situation, the appellate \r\n  court does not have to defer to the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Id. at 301-02, \r\n  584 S.E.2d at 155 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Stipulation of Facts\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the special referee erred \r\n  in selecting facts from the stipulation of facts submitted by the parties because \r\n  his order dismissing the case did not contain facts Appellant feels were pertinent \r\n  to the issue under consideration.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough the referee premised the original \r\n  order dismissing the case by noting the parties â€œentered into the following \r\n  Stipulations of Facts,â€ this assertion was corrected in the refereeâ€™s order \r\n  ruling on Appellantâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  In the later order, the referee \r\n  corrected his previous assertion by noting that the facts in the original order \r\n  were taken from the partiesâ€™ stipulation of facts.Â  The referee stated that \r\n  the original order should have begun with the assertion that â€œ[t]he parties \r\n  entered into a Stipulation of Facts prior to the hearing in the above-captioned \r\n  action and this Court deemed the following facts salient to its decision.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThus, because the referee corrected any \r\n  possible error in his order on Appellantâ€™s motion for reconsideration, we find \r\n  this argument to be without merit.\r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Status of the At-Fault Vehicle\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the referee erred in \r\n  his determination that the at-fault vehicle was either a â€œnon-owned autoâ€ or \r\n  a â€œhired autoâ€ under the commercial auto coverage section of the insurance policies.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nThe commercial auto coverage sections \r\n  in the National policies issued to American of Charleston and American of Texas \r\n  provide, in pertinent part, that the policies supply liability coverage in the \r\n  amount of $1,000,000.Â  The policies explain that the coverage will only apply \r\n  to â€œthose â€˜autosâ€™ shown as covered â€˜autosâ€™.Â  â€˜Autosâ€™ are shown as covered â€˜autosâ€™ \r\n  by the entry of one or more of the symbols from the COVERED AUTOS Section of \r\n  the Garage Coverage Form next to the name of the coverage.â€Â  Beside the coverage \r\n  section titled liability in the American of Charleston and American of Texas \r\n  policies appear the symbols 28 and 29.Â  \r\nThe definitions for symbols 28 and 29 \r\n  are located in Section I of the garage coverage form contained in the commercial \r\n  auto coverage section of the policies.Â  Section I begins with a disclaimer which \r\n  provides, in pertinent part, that â€œ[t]he symbols entered next to a coverage \r\n  on the Declarations designate the only â€˜autosâ€™ that are covered â€˜autosâ€™.â€Â  Following \r\n  this disclaimer, section I goes on to define the available symbols, including \r\n  28 and 29.Â  The following definition is located next to symbol 28: â€œHIRED â€˜AUTOSâ€™ \r\n  ONLY.Â  Only those â€˜autosâ€™ you lease, hire, rent or borrow.Â  This does not include \r\n  any â€˜autoâ€™ you lease, hire, rent or borrow from any of your employees or partners \r\n  or members of their households.â€Â  The definition next to symbol 29 provides: \r\n  â€œNON-OWNED â€˜AUTOSâ€™ USED IN YOUR GARAGE BUSINESS.Â  Any â€˜autoâ€™ you do not own, \r\n  lease, hire, rent or borrow used in connection with your garage business described \r\n  in the Declarations.Â  This includes â€˜autosâ€™ owned by your employees or partners \r\n  or members of their households while used in your garage business.â€Â  \r\nBefore making the determination that the \r\n  at-fault vehicle was either a hired auto or non-owned auto, the special referee \r\n  stated that while â€œ[a]t first blush, one could believe that this Courtâ€™s job \r\n  was to determine the legal owner of the vehicle driven by Rickie Johnson in \r\n  order to determine coverage.Â  That is not the case.Â  The Court must determine \r\n  for purposes of the insurance policies what the status is of the vehicle driven \r\n  by Rickie Johnson.â€Â  We disagree with this statement.Â  We believe that legal \r\n  ownership is exactly what this court must determine before we can rule on whether \r\n  the vehicle was a covered auto.\r\nAs clearly stated in the policy language \r\n  in the excerpt above, the only autos covered under the policy are those falling \r\n  within the purview of symbols 28 and 29.Â  Symbol 28 refers to hired autos as \r\n  autos â€œyou lease, hire, rent or borrow.â€Â  Similarly, symbol 29 encompasses only \r\n  those autos that are not owned.Â  Therefore, to determine whether coverage exists, \r\n  this court must examine the ownership status of the at-fault vehicle.\r\n&nbsp;â€œThough a certificate of title constitutes \r\n  prima facie evidence of ownership for purposes of insurance coverage, this presumption \r\n  can be rebutted by evidence establishing someone other than the titleholder \r\n  is the true holder.â€Â  Pennell v. Foster, 388 S.C. 9, 15, 524 S.E.2d 630, \r\n  633 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Tollison v. Reaves, 277 S.C. 443, 445, 289 \r\n  S.E.2d 163, 164 (1982)).Â  Although in this case, the at-fault vehicle was titled \r\n  and insured under the name of S.C. Auto Sales &amp; Recovery, the evidence clearly \r\n  established that American of Charleston was its true owner.Â  American of Charleston \r\n  paid the purchase price of the truck, as well as all insurance, taxes, gas, \r\n  and required maintenance. Â Â Â Â  American of Charleston also maintained possession \r\n  of the truck and controlled the determination of how and when it would be utilized.Â  \r\n  American of Charleston listed the truck as an asset on its financial statements \r\n  and claimed depreciation of the truck on the companyâ€™s tax returns.Â  Finally, \r\n  at the time of the incident, the truck was being utilized to repossess three \r\n  vehicles on behalf of American of Charleston.Â  \r\nWe find these additional facts adequate \r\n  to rebut the prima facie evidence of ownership established by the title alone.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we hold that American of Charleston was the legal owner of the truck \r\n  at the time of the incident.Â  Accordingly, because American of Charleston owned \r\n  the truck at the time of the incident, it was neither a hired auto â€“ because \r\n  it was not leased, hired, rented, or borrowed â€“ nor a non-owned auto under the \r\n  policy issued by National to American of Charleston.Â  As such, we find the vehicle \r\n  was not a covered auto under the commercial auto coverage section of the policy.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\n\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercial \r\n  auto coverage\r\n\r\nThe special referee held \r\n  that regardless of how the vehicle was characterized â€“ as either a hired auto, \r\n  non-owned auto, or owned auto â€“ coverage existed because the vehicle \r\n  was being used for garage operations at the time of the accident.Â  Appellant \r\n  argues this ruling was in error.Â  We affirm the special referee on alternate \r\n  grounds.\r\nInsurance contracts are subject \r\n  to â€œthe general rules of contract construction.â€Â  Hansen ex rel. Hansen v. \r\n  United Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 68, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002) \r\n  (citing Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., \r\n  301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 461 (1990)).Â  The primary purpose of all \r\n  rules of contract construction is to determine the intent of the parties.Â  Id. \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  â€œIf the contractâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous, the \r\n  language alone determines the contractâ€™s force and effect.â€Â  Schulmeyer v. \r\n  State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003) \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  \r\n&nbsp;â€œâ€˜[A] contract is ambiguous only when \r\n  it may fairly and reasonably be understood in more ways than one.â€™â€Â  Hansen, \r\n  350 S.C. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 117 (quoting Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Life Ins. Co., 298 S.C. 404, 407, 380 S.E.2d 858, \r\n  860 (Ct. App. 1989)).Â  â€œWhere language used in an insurance contract is ambiguous, \r\n  or where it is capable of two reasonable interpretations, that construction \r\n  which is most favorable to the insured will be adopted.â€Â  Id. (quoting \r\n  Poston v. Natâ€™l Fid. Life Ins. Co., 303 S.C. 182, 187, 399 S.E.2d 770, \r\n  772 (1990)).\r\nThe schedule of coverages and covered autos \r\n  contained in the commercial auto coverage section of the National policies provides:\r\n\r\nThis policy provides only those coverages where a charge \r\n  is shown in the premium column below.Â  Each of these coverages will apply \r\n  only to those â€˜autosâ€™ shown as covered â€˜autosâ€™. â€˜Autosâ€™ are shown as covered \r\n  â€˜autosâ€™ for a particular coverage by the entry of one or more of the symbols \r\n  from the COVERED AUTOS Section of the Garage Coverage Form next to the name \r\n  of the coverage.Â  Entry of a symbol next to LIABILITY provides coverage for \r\n  â€˜garage operationsâ€™.â€Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nAfter considering this provision of the \r\n  policies, the special referee reasoned that because symbols 28 and 29 appear \r\n  beside the coverage titled liability, coverage also existed for garage operations.Â  \r\n  Section VI of the garage coverage form contained in the commercial auto coverage \r\n  section of the policies defines garage operations as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œGarage operationsâ€ means the ownership, maintenance or \r\n  use of locations for garage business and that portion of the roads or other \r\n  accesses that adjoin these locations.Â  â€œGarage operationsâ€ includes the ownership, \r\n  maintenance or use of the â€œautosâ€ indicated in SECTION I of this Coverage Form \r\n  as covered â€œautosâ€.Â  â€œGarage operationsâ€ also include all operations necessary \r\n  or incidental to a garage business.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe special referee considered the language \r\n  contained in this definition along with the appearance of symbols 28 and 29 \r\n  on the declarations page, and stated that â€œthere can be no question but that \r\n  there is liability coverage for garage operations which includes all operations \r\n  necessary or incidental to a garage business.â€Â  The referee concluded that because \r\n  the at-fault driver was engaged in repossessions when the accident occurred, \r\n  he was performing tasks necessary and/or incidental to American of Charlestonâ€™s \r\n  garage business.Â  In fact, the referee stated, â€œThe clear and unambiguous language \r\n  of the policy provides coverage for garage operations.Â  [The at-fault driver] \r\n  was performing garage operations at the time [the decedent] was killed; thus, \r\n  coverage is provided by the [National] policies.â€Â  \r\nTo add support to this statement, \r\n  the referee examined Section II of the garage coverage form contained in the \r\n  commercial auto coverage section of the National policies, which explains the \r\n  liability coverage under that section.Â  First, the form defines who an insured \r\n  is for covered autos.Â  The form then defines who an insured is other than for \r\n  covered autos, stating, â€œâ€˜insuredsâ€™ for â€˜garage operationsâ€™ other than covered \r\n  â€˜autos,â€™â€ include American of Charleston or American of Texas and their \r\n  â€œpartners, employees, directors or shareholders but only while acting within \r\n  the scope of their duties.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Because the at-fault driver \r\n  was an employee of American of Charleston, the referee concluded that he was \r\n  an insured for purposes of the policy and that it did not matter whether the \r\n  at-fault vehicle was a covered auto or not.Â  \r\nFinally, the referee examined the general \r\n  insuring agreement, which provided that National â€œwill pay all sums an â€˜insuredâ€™ \r\n  legally must pay as damages because of â€˜bodily injuryâ€™ or â€˜property damageâ€™ \r\n  to which this insurance applies, caused by an â€˜accidentâ€™ and resulting from \r\n  â€˜garage operations.â€™â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTaking all of the above excerpted \r\n  provisions together, the special referee concluded that coverage existed under \r\n  the commercial auto coverage section of the National policies because the at-fault \r\n  driver was an insured and because the decedentâ€™s injuries constituted bodily \r\n  injury, were caused by an accident, and resulted from garage operations.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the refereeâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that coverage existed under the commercial auto coverage section \r\n  of the National policies.Â  However, we disagree that the policy clearly and \r\n  unambiguously provided coverage under the facts of this particular case.Â  \r\nAs Appellant points out, the special refereeâ€™s \r\n  interpretation of the policy provisions at issue renders pointless the designation \r\n  of specific classes of autos included in the covered autos section of the policy.Â  \r\n  American of Charleston chose to include only symbols 28 and 29 on the covered \r\n  autos section of the commercial auto coverage section of the National policies.Â  \r\n  It had the option of choosing from among eleven possible auto designations, \r\n  but only chose two, indicating the covered autos under the commercial auto section \r\n  of the policies would include only hired autos and non-owned autos.Â  \r\nThe referee read the last sentence of \r\n  the garage operations definition together with the definition of insureds for \r\n  garage operations as preempting the designations of vehicles contained on the \r\n  garage coverage form in the commercial auto coverage section of the National \r\n  policies.Â  The last sentence of the garage operations definition states that \r\n  â€œâ€˜[g]arage operationsâ€™ also include all operations necessary or incidental to \r\n  garage business.â€Â  Further, the policy states that â€œâ€˜insuredsâ€™â€ for â€˜garage \r\n  operationsâ€™ other than covered â€˜autos,â€™â€ includes employees of American of Charleston \r\n  or American of Texas.Â  The special refereeâ€™s interpretation of these provisions \r\n  would have the policy providing coverage for any accident involving garage operations \r\n  no matter what designation of auto was involved.Â  Thus, even though American \r\n  of Charleston only chose to include hired autos and non-owned autos on the garage \r\n  coverage form, if an accident involving garage operations occurred with a vehicle \r\n  not falling within these designations, it would still be covered as garage operations \r\n  under the commercial auto section of the National policies.Â  \r\nBecause we find that the policy \r\n  language limiting coverage to non-owned and hired autos materially conflicts \r\n  with the policy language defining garage operations and insureds for garage \r\n  operations, we find that the policy provisions are open to more than one reasonable \r\n  interpretation.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that the policy provisions at issue \r\n  are ambiguous.Â  Hansen, 350 S.C. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 117.Â  Therefore, \r\n  based on the premise that ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance contract \r\n  should be construed in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, \r\n  we affirm the special referee in finding the commercial auto liability coverage \r\n  section of the National policies provided coverage for Appellantâ€™s claims.Â  \r\n  Diamond State Ins.

Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, \r\n  456 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1995).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercial \r\n  General Liability Coverage\r\n\r\nThe special referee ruled that coverage also \r\n  existed under the commercial general liability coverage section of the policies \r\n  issued by National to American of Charleston and American of Texas.Â  Appellant \r\n  maintains this ruling was in error.Â  We agree.\r\nAs noted in the discussion of the previous \r\n  issue, the general insurance agreement provides that National â€œwill pay all \r\n  sums an â€˜insuredâ€™ legally must pay as damages because of â€˜bodily injuryâ€™ or \r\n  â€˜property damageâ€™ to which this insurance applies.â€Â  An â€œinsured,â€ for purposes \r\n  of the commercial general liability coverage section of the National policies, \r\n  includes employees acting within the scope of their employment.Â  The referee \r\n  concluded Johnson was an insured under the commercial general liability coverage \r\n  section because he was engaged in the repossession of vehicles at the time of \r\n  the accident and thus, was acting within the scope of his employment.\r\nThe commercial general liability coverage \r\n  section contains an exclusion from coverage, however, which provides, in pertinent \r\n  part, that coverage does not apply to â€œâ€˜[b]odily injuryâ€™ or â€˜property damageâ€™ \r\n  arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any \r\n  aircraft, â€˜autoâ€™ or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any \r\n  insured.â€Â  \r\nThe referee found this exclusion did not \r\n  apply to American of Charleston because Appellant asserted multiple causes of \r\n  action in the underlying complaint that did not involve the use of an auto, \r\n  including a cause of action for negligent hiring and supervision.Â  The referee \r\n  further held that because the cause of action for negligent hiring and supervision \r\n  did not fall within the exclusion, coverage was provided under the policies.Â  \r\n  On appeal, State Farm argues that Appellantâ€™s causes of action for negligent \r\n  hiring and supervision as well as negligence in failing to provide the financial \r\n  resources necessary to safely perform repossession, failing to maintain a proper \r\n  fleet of repossession equipment, requiring employees to undertake excessive \r\n  amounts of work, and requiring employees to mainly work at night fall outside \r\n  the auto exclusion in the commercial general liability coverage section.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nIn finding Appellantâ€™s causes of action did \r\n  not involve the use of an auto, both the refereeâ€™s order and State Farmâ€™s argument \r\n  on appeal fail to recognize the specific language contained in the auto exclusion.Â  \r\n  The exclusion provides, â€œ[t]his insurance does not apply to . . . â€˜Bodily injuryâ€™ \r\n  or â€˜property damageâ€™ arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment \r\n  of others of an . . . â€˜autoâ€™. . . .â€Â Â  The terms bodily injury and property \r\n  damage are both defined terms in the insurance contract.Â  Bodily injury is defined \r\n  as â€œbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death \r\n  resulting from any of these at any time.â€Â  Property damage is defined as â€œ(a)Â  \r\n  [p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of uses \r\n  of that property; or (b) [l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically \r\n  injured.â€Â  Neither of these definitions limits the application of the auto exclusion \r\n  only to causes of action that arise out of the use or entrustment of \r\n  an auto.Â  Rather, these definitions assure the parties that the auto exclusion \r\n  applies to all bodily injury and property damage arising out of the use or entrustment \r\n  of an auto.Â  See McPhearson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. \r\n  316, 320, 426 S.E.2d 770, 771 (1993) (â€œ[H]old[ing] that for the purpose of construing \r\n  an exclusionary clause in a general liability policy, â€˜arising out ofâ€™ should \r\n  be narrowly construed as â€˜caused by.â€™â€); MGC Mgmt. Of Charleston, Inc. v. \r\n  Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 549-50, 520 S.E.2d 820, 824 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (stating that an automobile exclusion applied to the occurrence itself \r\n  and not the type of damages, and because the death arose from use of a car, \r\n  the policy excluded damages emanating from the death). In this case, regardless \r\n  of what specific cause of action Appellant asserted in the complaint, Appellant \r\n  was seeking to recover damages for bodily injury.Â  Furthermore, Appellant was \r\n  seeking damages for bodily injury arising out of the use or entrustment of an \r\n  auto because decedentâ€™s injuries resulted from being struck by an auto driven \r\n  by an employee of American of Charleston.Â  As a result, we find no applicable \r\n  coverage under the commercial general liability coverage section of the National \r\n  policies because the auto exclusion specifically excluded coverage for decedentâ€™s \r\n  injuries.Â  \r\n\r\n  V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Gap in Coverage\r\n\r\nAppellant asserts the special referee erred \r\n  in failing to conclude that the at-fault vehicle was not an underinsured vehicle \r\n  even if liability coverage existed under the National policies.Â  This argument \r\n  is premised on the idea that coverage under the National policies, if any, constituted \r\n  excess coverage because it was above and beyond the coverage required under \r\n  the South Carolina Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act. [1] Â  As such, Appellant asserts there was a gap in coverage due \r\n  to the deductible contained in the National policies and that the State Farm \r\n  underinsured motorist benefits should apply to cover that gap.Â  The referee \r\n  declined to find such a gap in coverage.Â  We agree.\r\nAs State Farm correctly points out, the only \r\n  deductible contained in the National policies is a $25,000 per claim deductible \r\n  on bodily injury and property damage under the commercial general liability \r\n  coverage section of the policies.Â  Because we have previously determined that \r\n  coverage does not exist to cover Appellantâ€™s claims under the commercial general \r\n  liability coverage section, this deductible would be inapplicable.\r\nFurthermore, even though we previously concluded \r\n  that coverage existed under the commercial auto section of the policies, that \r\n  section of the policies is not subject to a deductible.Â  As a result, we find \r\n  that the referee did not err in declining to find a gap in coverage.\r\n\r\n  VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consideration \r\n  of Other Policies\r\n\r\nAppellant asserts that, even assuming coverage \r\n  existed under the National policies, the referee erred in failing to conclude \r\n  that these policies should not be taken into consideration when determining \r\n  whether the vehicle was underinsured for the purpose of receiving underinsured \r\n  motorist benefits.Â  Appellant argues that under the compulsory system of automobile \r\n  liability insurance established by the South Carolina Motor Vehicle Financial \r\n  Responsibility Act, only â€œmotor vehicle liability polic[ies],â€ as defined by \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-20(5) (Supp. 2003) \r\n  [2]  should be taken into consideration when determining whether an insured \r\n  is entitled to underinsured motorist benefits.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 56-9-20(5) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) defines a motor vehicle liability policy, in relevant part, \r\n  as:\r\n\r\nAn ownerâ€™s or an operatorâ€™s policy of liability insurance \r\n  that fulfills all the requirements of Â§Â§ 38-77-140 through 38-77-230, certified \r\n  as provided in Â§ 56-9-550 or 56-9-560 as proof of financial responsibility and \r\n  issued, except as otherwise provided in Â§ 56-9-560, by an insurance carrier \r\n  duly authorized to transact business in this State, to or for the benefit of \r\n  the person or persons named therein as insured, and any other person, as insured, \r\n  using the vehicle described therein with the express or implied permission of \r\n  the named insured and subject to the following conditions . . . .\r\n\r\nAppellant asserts that the National policies \r\n  at issue in this case did not constitute motor vehicle liability policies, even \r\n  if they do provide coverage for decedentâ€™s injuries, because the policies did \r\n  not provide vehicle specific coverage as required by the definition of a motor \r\n  vehicle liability policy.\r\nIn support of this argument, Appellant asks \r\n  this court to read the definition of â€œinsured motor vehicle,â€ found in the Financial \r\n  Responsibility Act, together with the definition of â€œunderinsured motor vehicle,â€ \r\n  found in the automobile insurance chapter \r\n  [3]  of the code, to find that the only relevant insurance policies, for \r\n  purposes of underinsured motorist coverage, are motor vehicle liability policies.\r\nSection 56-9-20(1) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) defines an insured motor vehicle as follows:\r\n\r\nA motor vehicle as to which there is bodily injury \r\n  liability insurance and property damage liability insurance, meeting all of \r\n  the requirements of item (7) [4]  \r\n  of this section, or as to which a bond has been given or cash or securities \r\n  delivered in lieu of such insurance or as to which the owner has qualified as \r\n  a self-insurer in accordance with the provisions of Â§ 56-9-60 . . . .\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-30 (15) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (2002 and Supp. 2003) defines an underinsured motor vehicle as:\r\n\r\n[A] motor vehicle as to which there is bodily injury \r\n  liability insurance or a bond applicable at the time of the accident in an amount \r\n  of at least that specified in Section 38-77-140 and the amount of the insurance \r\n  or bond is less than the amount of the insuredsâ€™ damages.\r\n\r\nWe decline to limit the definition of underinsured \r\n  motor vehicle to those with vehicle specific liability insurance.Â  Courts must \r\n  take a statute as it is drafted and give effect to the legislative intent as \r\n  expressed in its language.Â  See State v. White, 338 S.C. 56, 58, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 261, 263 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A subtle or forced construction of words \r\n  in a statute for the purpose of expanding the operation of a statute is prohibited.Â  \r\n  See Moon v. City of Greer, 348 S.C. 184, 188, 558 S.E.2d 527, \r\n  530 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he lawmaking bodyâ€™s construction of \r\n  its language by means of definitions of the terms employed should be followed \r\n  in the interpretation of the act or section to which it relates and is intended \r\n  to apply.â€Â  Fruehauf Trailer Co., v. South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co., \r\n  223 S.C. 320, 325, 75 S.E.2d 688, 690 (1953).Â Â  \r\nNotably, the definition of an underinsured \r\n  motor vehicle does not contain the requirement that the applicable insurance \r\n  meet all the elements of a motor vehicle liability policy as the definition \r\n  of an insured motor vehicle does.Â  Rather, an underinsured motor vehicle is \r\n  defined as one to which there is bodily injury liability insurance [5]  at the time of the accident and the amount \r\n  of the insurance is less than the amount of the insuredâ€™s damages.Â  In this \r\n  case, there was bodily injury liability insurance at the time of the accident \r\n  from both the South Carolina Insurance Company policy and, as discussed above, \r\n  the commercial auto coverage section of the National policies.\r\nFurthermore, the State Farm underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  contained the following provision:Â  â€œThere is no coverage until the limits of \r\n  liability of all applicable bodily injury liability and property damage liability \r\n  insurance policies or bonds that apply to the bodily injury or property damage \r\n  have been used up by payment of judgments or settlements.â€Â Â  An endorsement \r\n  to the State Farm policy contains a definition of an underinsured motor vehicle \r\n  almost identical to the definition of an underinsured motor vehicle contained \r\n  in section 38-77-30 (14).Â  The endorsement states that â€œa motor vehicle, as \r\n  to which there is bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the \r\n  time of the accident in an amount of at least that specified in the Financial \r\n  Responsibility Act and the amount of insurance or bond is less than the \r\n  amount of the insuredâ€™s damages.â€Â  Because the National policies are applicable \r\n  bodily injury liability policies, we find the provision in the State Farm policy \r\n  excluding underinsured motorist coverage until the limits of liability of all \r\n  applicable bodily injury liability policies have been exhausted is effective \r\n  to bar Appellantâ€™s claim for underinsured motorist coverage under the State \r\n  Farm policy.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we \r\n  agree with the Appellant that the special referee erred in concluding the truck \r\n  operated by Johnson at the time of the accident was a non-owned or hired auto.Â  \r\n  We further agree with Appellant that the referee erred in concluding that the \r\n  commercial general liability coverage section of the National policies provided \r\n  coverage for Appellantâ€™s claims.Â  However, because we find that coverage existed \r\n  under the commercial auto coverage section of the policies, that no gap in coverage \r\n  existed, and that the National polices should be considered in determining whether \r\n  the vehicle was underinsured for purposes of receiving underinsured motorist \r\n  benefits, we affirm the special refereeâ€™s decision to dismiss the action, as \r\n  modified by this opinion.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  S.C.

McMaster, for Appellant.\r\nCarolyn Courville, of Houston, James Theodore Gentry, W. Howard \r\n  Boyd, Jr., Jennifer E. Johnson, and Ronald K. Wray, II, all of Greenville, for \r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Estalita Martin sued both her \r\n  health maintenance organization, Companion HealthCare, and Healthcare Recoveries, \r\n  Inc., alleging, among other things, that the amount they collected from her \r\n  in an exercise of Companionâ€™s subrogation right exceeded the cost of her medical \r\n  bills.Â  The trial court granted the defendantsâ€™ motions for summary judgment, \r\n  finding Martinâ€™s action was barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine \r\n  of voluntary payment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCompanion is a licensed health maintenance organization \r\n  that arranges for the provision of health care to its members by entering into \r\n  contracts with health care providers located throughout South Carolina.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to these arrangements, Companion compensates physicians, hospitals, clinics, \r\n  and other entities for health care provided to Companionâ€™s members. \r\nAppellant, Estalita Martin, was a member of Companion \r\n  when, on January 13, 1993, she was injured while riding a motorcycle.Â  Martin \r\n  brought suit against the other party to the accident.Â  The contract between \r\n  Companion and Martin gave Companion a subrogation right for amounts it paid \r\n  to health care providers on Martinâ€™s behalf for which she obtained compensation \r\n  from the at-fault driver in the motorcycle wreck litigation.Â  By letter dated \r\n  June 4, 1993, Martinâ€™s attorney assured Companion that he would â€œprotect [Companionâ€™s] \r\n  right of subrogation upon the settlement of the above matter and upon notification \r\n  from [his] client that these terms are acceptable.â€Â  \r\nThrough 1995, Companion paid total claims related \r\n  to Martinâ€™s accident in the amount of $13,721.45.Â  After Martin settled her \r\n  lawsuit against the at-fault driver, Companion instructed Healthcare Recoveries \r\n  to pursue a subrogation claim against Martin in the amount of $13,415.45. \r\n  [1] \r\nActing on behalf of Companion, Healthcare Recoveries \r\n  executed a release of Companionâ€™s subrogation right, dated August 4, 1995.Â  \r\n  In consideration for this release, Martin paid $13,415.45 to Healthcare Recoveries \r\n  on August 8, 1995.Â  \r\nMartin initiated this lawsuit against Companion and \r\n  Healthcare Recoveries more than four years later, in December 1999.Â  Although \r\n  the complaint asserts twelve different causes of action, the gravamen of Martinâ€™s \r\n  claims is that Companion could not legally assert its contractual right to subrogation, \r\n  [2]  or in the alternative, that Companion was not entitled to the amount \r\n  it recovered in subrogation.\r\nThroughout the discovery process, Martin demanded access \r\n  to Companionâ€™s â€œprovider contracts,â€ which Martin asserts would determine how \r\n  much Companion paid providers for Martinâ€™s medical expenses.Â  Companion failed \r\n  to respond to the request.\r\nCompanion and Healthcare Recoveries filed motions to \r\n  dismiss, which the trial court partially converted to motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  The court granted the motions, and Martin appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in converting the defendantsâ€™ \r\n  motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment \r\n  when Companionâ€™s provider contracts were not produced during discovery?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         3.&nbsp;\r\n         Are Martinâ€™s claims barred by the Statute of Limitations?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         4.&nbsp;\r\n         Are Martinâ€™s claims barred by the â€œvoluntary paymentâ€ \r\n  doctrine?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Propriety of the Motions for Summary \r\n  JudgmentÂ Â Â Â  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\nMartin first argues the trial court erred when \r\n  it converted the defendantsâ€™ motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn support of their motions to dismiss \r\n  based on the statute of limitations and the voluntary payment doctrine, Companion \r\n  and Healthcare Recoveries submitted affidavits from Rebecca Haberman, the claims \r\n  examiner who received the check from Martin in exchange for the release of subrogation \r\n  rights, and David Pankau, the senior vice-president of Companion who detailed \r\n  the amounts Companion paid on Martinâ€™s behalf. Martin filed a memorandum in \r\n  opposition to the defendantsâ€™ motions and provided affidavits from Timothy Schmidt, \r\n  an auditor for health benefits plans, and from Martin herself.\r\nWhen a court is considering a motion to \r\n  dismiss and matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded \r\n  by the court, â€œthe motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed \r\n  of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity \r\n  to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.â€Â  Rule 12(b), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  See also Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999) (stating that conversion of a motion to dismiss into a \r\n  motion for summary judgment is proper when the parties are afforded a reasonable \r\n  opportunity to respond to such matters).Â  \r\nWith respect to Companionâ€™s and Healthcare \r\n  Recoveriesâ€™ motions to dismiss based upon the statute of limitations and voluntary \r\n  payment defenses, the trial court considered matters submitted by the parties \r\n  outside the pleadings.Â Â  Importantly, Martin had notice that matters outside \r\n  the pleadings would be considered because she was served with the affidavits \r\n  two months prior to the motion hearing and was afforded the opportunity to respond.Â  \r\n  Indeed, Martin took advantage of this opportunity by submitting affidavits of \r\n  her own to the trial court along with her memorandum opposing the defendantsâ€™ \r\n  motions.Â  Thus, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s conversion of the defendantsâ€™ \r\n  motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment.\r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Summary Judgment\r\n\r\nMartin next argues the trial court should not have granted \r\n  summary judgment to Companion and Healthcare Recoveries without first permitting \r\n  her to conduct discovery relating to alleged contracts in which the medical \r\n  providers who treated Martin may have given Companion year-end rebates.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine \r\n  issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n  of law.â€Â  Cunningham ex. rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. \r\n  485, 491, 575 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2003).Â  When considering a motion for summary \r\n  judgment, the court views the evidence and all inferences that can be reasonably \r\n  drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, the trial court found Companion and Healthcare \r\n  Recoveries were entitled to summary judgment because Martinâ€™s claims were barred \r\n  by the three-year statute of limitations for causes of action for breach of \r\n  contract and fraud.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1)&amp;(7) (Supp. 2003).Â  Because \r\n  we agree with this ruling, we find that Martinâ€™s inability to discover the provider \r\n  contracts is irrelevant.\r\nAccording to the discovery rule, the three-year \r\n  statute of limitations found in section 15-3-350 begins to run when the underlying \r\n  cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.Â  Dean v. Ruscon \r\n  Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  Thus, the three-year \r\n  clock starts ticking on the â€œdate the injured party either knows or should have \r\n  known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises \r\n  from the wrongful conduct.â€Â  Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Transp., 344 S.C. \r\n  115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This determination is objective, \r\n  rather than subjective.Â  Id.Â  As such, the question is not whether the \r\n  particular plaintiff in this case actually knew she had a claim.Â  Instead, we \r\n  approach this inquiry by deciding â€œwhether the circumstances of the case would \r\n  put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of \r\n  his has been invaded, or that some claim against another party might exist.â€ \r\n  Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416Â  \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nHere, Martin, through her attorney, received a release \r\n  of Companionâ€™s right to subrogation by paying $13,415.45 to Healthcare Recoveries \r\n  in August of 1995.Â  At this date, Martin unquestionably knew Companion was seeking \r\n  subrogation and knew the amount of money Companion was seeking.Â  She did not \r\n  commence the present case, however, until December of 1999, four years after \r\n  she had reimbursed Companion.Â  \r\nDespite these uncontested facts, Martin \r\n  asserts the statute of limitations has not run because there is no evidence \r\n  that she knew or should have known at the time of payment that Companion and \r\n  Healthcare Recoveries may have been collecting more than the amount Companion \r\n  actually paid on her behalf.Â  Martin further argues she should be entitled to \r\n  review provider contracts between Companion and each of the health care providers \r\n  who treated her to determine whether the amount she paid Healthcare Recoveries \r\n  exceeded the amount Companion expended on her. \r\nNotably, during the four-year interim \r\n  between Martinâ€™s payment to Healthcare Recoveries and the filing of the instant \r\n  cause of action, Martin cannot point to any events, other than her original \r\n  payment of the claim and a meeting she had with attorneys, [3]  that caused her to â€œdiscoverâ€ \r\n  this claim.Â  In Dorman v. Campbell, 331 S.C. 179, 184, 500 S.E.2d 786, \r\n  789 (Ct. App. 1998), our court explained that the triggering of the statute \r\n  of limitations is â€œnot when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory \r\n  of recovery developed,â€ but rather when the facts and circumstances of an injury \r\n  would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim \r\n  exists.\r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that the very \r\n  latest Martin knew the facts and circumstances surrounding Companionâ€™s subrogation \r\n  lien was in August of 1995, when she paid $13,415.45 in exchange for a release \r\n  of Companionâ€™s subrogation rights.Â  Therefore, the statute of limitations began \r\n  to run at that time and expired in August of 1998.Â  Because the complaint in \r\n  this case was not filed until 1999, the trial court did not err in finding Martinâ€™s \r\n  claims were barred by the statute of limitations. \r\n  [4] \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Healthcare Recoveries is in the business of pursuing subrogation \r\n    claims on behalf of health plans and other health care payers.Â  Healthcare \r\n    Recoveries does not provide health care services or insurance, or make payments \r\n    to health care providers.Â  Instead, Healthcare Recoveries merely relieves \r\n    health plans like Companion of the administrative burden of pursuing and recovering \r\n    subrogation payments due to them.Â  At all times relevant to this action, Healthcare \r\n    Recoveries was under contract to handle Companionâ€™s subrogation claims in \r\n    South Carolina.Â  In return for a fee, Healthcare Recoveries acted on Companionâ€™s \r\n    behalf to recover its subrogation amount from Martin. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The court found that health maintenance organizations are entitled \r\n    to subrogate under South Carolina law, and Martin does not appeal from this \r\n    ruling.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Martin is represented in this action by the same \r\n    law firm that represented her in the 1995 motorcycle accident litigation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Because the trial court properly found Martinâ€™s \r\n    action was barred by the statute of limitations, we need not address her other \r\n    arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3751","title":"State v.

[1]   \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nSubsequently, Barnett was convicted on all the \r\n  charges and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for each of the kidnapping \r\n  charges, forty years imprisonment for each of the burglary charges, and five \r\n  years imprisonment for the grand larceny of a motor vehicle charge, all to run \r\n  concurrently.Â Â Â Â Â  Barnett appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBarnett argues the indictment for grand \r\n  larceny of a motor vehicle was insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because the body of the indictment did not allege the stolen vehicle was valued \r\n  at more than one thousand dollars.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn evaluating the sufficiency of an indictment, \r\n  this Court should â€œlook at the issue with a practical eye in view of the surrounding \r\n  circumstances.â€Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 \r\n  (1993); see also State v. Thompson, 305 S.C. 496, 504 n. 1, 409 \r\n  S.E.2d 420, 425 n. 1 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding when evaluating an indictment, \r\n  this Court should give â€œa common sense reading [to] the indictment as a wholeâ€).Â  \r\n  If the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable \r\n  the trial court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know \r\n  what he is called upon to answer, the indictment is sufficient to confer subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 777 (1998). â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether \r\n  it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the \r\n  defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  Browning v. State, 320 \r\n  S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (citations omitted).Â Â  â€œAn indictment \r\n  passes legal muster if it â€˜charges the crime substantially in the language of \r\n  the . . . statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the \r\n  offense charged may be easily understood . . . .â€™â€Â  State v. Reddick, \r\n  348 S.C. 631, 635, 560 S.E.2d 441, 443 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-19-20 (1985)).\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section \r\n  16-13-30(B) (2003) defines grand larceny as â€œ[larceny] of goods, chattels, instruments, \r\n  or other personalty valued in excess of one thousand dollars . . . .â€Â  See \r\n  State v. Parker, 351 S.C. 567, 570, 571 S.E.2d 288, 289 (2002) (â€œ[G]rand \r\n  larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of another, where \r\n  the value exceeds $1,000.â€).Â  Larceny is the taking and carrying away of the \r\n  goods of another without consent.Â Â  State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 49, \r\n  260 S.E.2d 719, 720 (1979).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is clear the indictment sufficiently alleges \r\n  larceny, a misdemeanor, as it alleged Barnett feloniously took a motor vehicle \r\n  from Rosa Daniels against the peace and dignity of the State.Â  See Brown, \r\n  274 S.C. at 49, 260 S.E.2d at 720 (holding larceny is the taking and carrying \r\n  away of the goods of another without consent).Â  However, the remaining inquiry \r\n  is whether the indictment sufficiently alleges the motor vehicle was worth more \r\n  than one thousand dollars, elevating the charge to grand larceny.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30(B).\r\nThis case is analogous to State v. Wilkes, \r\n  353 S.C. 462, 578 S.E.2d 717 (2003).Â  In Wilkes, the defendant was convicted \r\n  of one count of resisting arrest and two counts of assault on a correctional \r\n  facility employee.Â  One of the indictments was captioned, â€œASSAULT ON CORRECTIONAL \r\n  FACILITY EMPLOYEE Â§ 16-3-630,â€ and the other indictment was captioned â€œASSAULT \r\n  ON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY EMPLOYEE.â€Â  Both indictments alleged the defendant \r\n  â€œdid in Chester County on or about April 24, 1999[,] assault . . . [an officer] \r\n  while she[/he] was attempting to process him after his arrest.â€Â  Neither of \r\n  the indictments, within their bodies, alleged the officers were correctional \r\n  facility employees.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court vacated the two indictments \r\n  for assault on a correctional facility employee, holding the indictments were \r\n  jurisdictionally defective because they failed to allege the officer was a correctional \r\n  facility employee.Â  This Court further held the captions of the indictments \r\n  could not cure the otherwise defective indictments.Â  Id. at 464, 578 \r\n  S.E.2d at 718.\r\nOn grant of certiorari, our supreme court reversed, \r\n  holding the indictments were sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to the circuit court because, reading the captions in conjunction with the body \r\n  of the indictment, the indictments â€œstated the offense with sufficient certainty \r\n  and particularity to enable the trial court to know what judgment to pronounce \r\n  and . . . [the defendant] to know what he was being called upon to answer.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 465, 578 S.E.2d at 719.Â  \r\nIn the present case, although the body of the indictment \r\n  fails to specifically state the motor vehicleâ€™s value was in excess of one thousand \r\n  dollars, the caption of the indictment states the charge is â€œGRAND LARCENYâ€ \r\n  and cites â€œS.C. Code:Â  16-13-30(B)(1).â€Â  We conclude this language, coupled \r\n  with the language in the body of the indictment, is sufficient to state the \r\n  offense of grand larceny with certainty and particularity such that the circuit \r\n  court knew what judgment to pronounce and Barnett knew what to defend against.Â  \r\n  Thus, the indictment is not jurisdictionally defective.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.\r\nBEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate \r\n  opinion.\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Barnett \r\n  maintains the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the grand \r\n  larceny charge because he was not properly indicted on the charge.Â  Specifically, \r\n  he contends the language of the indictment could be construed to mean he faced \r\n  the misdemeanor charge of petit larceny rather than grand larceny, which is \r\n  a felony.Â  Put differently, Barnett alleges the indictment failed to include \r\n  an essential element of grand larceny â€“ that the value of the property stolen \r\n  was in excess of $1,000.Â  I agree.\r\nIn July 2000, a grand jury indicted \r\n  Barnett for two counts of kidnapping, two counts of first-degree burglary, and \r\n  grand larceny.Â  The caption of Barnettâ€™s indictment for grand larceny readÂ  \r\n  â€œGRAND LARCENY OF MOTOR VEHICLE UNDER $5000â€ and referenced S.C. Code Section \r\n  16-13-30(B)(1).Â  The body of the indictment alleged:Â  \r\n\r\nThat John Barnett did in Richland County on or about May 10, \r\n  2000, feloniously take and carry away the personal property of Rosa Daniels, \r\n  to wit:Â  1988 Pontiac 6000 with S.C. tag 542KJD, valued under $5000.00.\r\n\r\nGrand larceny involves stolen property valued in \r\n  excess of $1,000, whereas petit larceny applies to stolen property valued at \r\n  $1,000 or less.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30, et seq. (Supp. 2002); \r\n  State v. Parker, 351 S.C. 567, 570, 571 S.E.2d 288, 289 (2002).Â  â€œThe \r\n  monetary value of the goods taken is an element of the offense of grand larceny.â€Â Â  \r\n  Parker, 351 S.C. at 571, 571 S.E.2d at 290; see also Johnson \r\n  v. State, 319 S.C. 62, 64, 459 S.E.2d 840, 841 (1995) (grand larceny involved \r\n  taking and carrying away of goods valued at $200 or more; value is element of \r\n  grand larceny offense); Â State v. Ates, 297 S.C. 316, 318, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  98, 99 n.1 (1989) (â€œIn a grand larceny prosecution, value is critical \r\n  element; it is the State's burden to prove value of stolen goods exceeds $200.â€) \r\n  (emphasis added). [2] Â  \r\nThe circuit court lacks jurisdiction to convict \r\n  a defendant of an offense unless the defendant waives presentment, the offense \r\n  is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged in the indictment, or there \r\n  is an indictment that sufficiently states the offense.Â  State v. Owens, \r\n  346 S.C. 637, 648, 552 S.E.2d 745, 751 (2001).Â  â€œAn indictment is sufficient \r\n  if it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended \r\n  to be charged and apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared \r\n  to meet.â€Â  Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 4, 507 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1998) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The indictment sufficiency criteria must be viewed with a \r\n  â€œpractical eyeâ€; all the surrounding circumstances must be weighed before an \r\n  accurate determination of whether a defendant was or was not prejudiced can \r\n  be reached.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993). \r\n  This includes looking both at the face of the indictment and the circumstances \r\n  surrounding the trial.Â  See State v. Reddick, 348 S.C. 631, 636, \r\n  560 S.E.2d 441, 443 (Ct. App. 2002) (examining the indictment â€œon its faceâ€ \r\n  and considering the â€œevents at trialâ€ to determine whether the appellants were \r\n  on notice and apprised of the charges against them).\r\nThe caption of the indictment charged \r\n  Barnett with violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30(B)(1). The caption read \r\n  that Barnett was charged with â€œGRAND LARCENY OF MOTOR VEHICLE UNDER $5000.â€Â  \r\n  However, the body of the indictment failed to make specific reference to the \r\n  code section applicable to grand larceny, and did not list the elements of the \r\n  offense. â€œ[O]ne cannot infer the elements of an offense from the caption of \r\n  the indictment.â€Â  State v. McCloud, 354 S.C. 40, 47, 579 S.E.2d 534, \r\n  537 (Ct. App. 2003) (Shuler, J., dissenting) (citing State v. Lark, 64 \r\n  S.C. 350, 353, 42 S.E. 175, 176-77 (1902)); see also State v. Tabory, \r\n  262 S.C. 136, 141, 202 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1974) (â€œ[T]he State may not support \r\n  a conviction for an offense intended to be charged by relying upon a caption \r\n  to the exclusion of the language contained in the body of the indictment.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nOur supreme court used the phrase â€œpractical eyeâ€ \r\n  to determine whether an indictment is legally sufficient.Â  See Gunn, \r\n  313 S.C. at 130, 437 S.E.2d at 78.Â  Courts are called to examine the totality \r\n  of the circumstances to determine whether a defendant was aware of the crime \r\n  for which he was charged.Â  Id.Â  â€œAll the surrounding circumstances must \r\n  be weighed before an accurate determination of whether a defendant was or was \r\n  not prejudiced can be reached.â€ [3] Â  Viewing the indictment with a practical eye, \r\n  I believe the indictment was insufficient to apprise Barnett of the elements \r\n  of the crime he should have been prepared to meet.Â  Nothing in the record indicates \r\n  that Barnett was granted a preliminary hearing, whereby he could discover the \r\n  crimes for which he was being tried.Â  See McCloud, 354 S.C. at \r\n  44, 579 S.E.2d at 536.Â Â  Although the record reflects that the trial court and \r\n  solicitor made several references to Barnettâ€™s charges, doing so during the \r\n  trial did not allot Barnett sufficient notice to prepare his defense.Â  \r\nIn State v. Wilkes, our supreme court reversed \r\n  this Courtâ€™s decision to vacate two indictments for assault on a correctional \r\n  facility employee.Â  353 S.C. 462, 578 S.E.2d 717 (2003).Â  The body of the indictments \r\n  used the word â€œofficerâ€ to describe the victim, instead of â€œcorrectional facility \r\n  employee.â€Â  Otherwise, the body of each indictment included the elements of \r\n  the offense, as well as the title and code section of the charges. [4] Â  Moreover, the language in the body of the \r\n  indictment was phrased substantially in the language of the statute defining \r\n  the offense. See State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 \r\n  (1981).\r\nUnlike Wilkes, the body of the indictment \r\n  in this matter does not include all of the elements of the offense of grand \r\n  larceny, nor does it include the code section.Â  Moreover, in Wilkes, \r\n  the gist of the issue was one of semantics, not elements of the offense. The \r\n  question was whether, in the context of the indictment, â€œofficerâ€ and â€œcorrectional \r\n  facility employeeâ€ were synonymous as used in the statute. Wilkes, 535 \r\n  S.C. at 464, 578 S.E.2d at 718. It was patently clear the words were synonymous.Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, in the instant case there is no such clarity.Â  \r\n  In actuality, the body of the indictment merely charges petit larceny.Â  The \r\n  caption of the indictment lists the code section where grand larceny of more \r\n  than $1000 and less than $5000 is set forth.Â  This caption may assist the judge \r\n  in determining the proper sentence; however, it does not provide the missing \r\n  element required in the body of the indictment for grand larceny.Â  See \r\n  Tabory, 262 S.C. at 140, 202 S.E.2d at 854. Therefore, Barnett was not \r\n  on proper notice of the crime charged: the offense of petit larceny as charged \r\n  in the body of the indictment or, grand larceny as stated in the caption.Â  An \r\n  indictment should not leave this question for criminal defendants to decipher; \r\n  the law requires indictments to clearly answer this question. \r\nWeighing the circumstances surrounding Barnettâ€™s \r\n  indictment and subsequent conviction, I believe Barnett was not sufficiently \r\n  apprised of the elements of the crime of grand larceny.Â  I believe the indictment \r\n  could have been construed to involve stolen property valued at less than $1,000, \r\n  making the crime petit larceny, a misdemeanor.Â  Therefore, Barnett was prejudiced \r\n  by the missing property value from the indictment. For the foregoing reasons, \r\n  I believe the conviction for grand larceny should be vacated.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The indictment originally alleged Clanda James owned the motor vehicle.Â  \r\n    However, the indictment was amended to name Rosa Daniels as the owner of the \r\n    motor vehicle.Â  The amendment of the name of the victim under these circumstances \r\n    is not a jurisdictional flaw.Â  See State v. Johnson, 314 S.C. \r\n    161, 166, 442 S.E.2d 191, 194 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding an amendment changing \r\n    the name of the owner of the property listed in an indictment for breach of \r\n    trust did not change the nature of the offense); State v. Sweat, 221 \r\n    S.C. 270, 273-74, 70 S.E.2d 234, 235-36 (1952) (holding an amendment to a \r\n    larceny indictment did not change the nature of the offense, where the indictment \r\n    changed the name of the victim); see also State v. Guthrie, \r\n    352 S.C. 103, 111-12, 572 S.E.2d 309, 313-14 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding an element \r\n    is an essential ingredient of the crime when an amendment to that element \r\n    would materially change the proof required to convict the defendant of the \r\n    crime);Â  41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations Â§ 168 (1995) (stating \r\n    an amendment is substantive and thus not permitted unless â€œthe same defense \r\n    is available to the defendant both before and after the amendment and upon \r\n    the same evidenceâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Previously, the value of goods for grand larceny was $200 or more.Â Â  \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (1985).Â Â  The statute has been amended \r\n    to set the value of goods for grand larceny at more than $1,000.Â  S.C.

Heyward, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Charleston County\r\nR. Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3752\r\nHeard January 13, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  8, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh,Â  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson,Â  \r\n  Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor \r\n  Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  Anthony A. Heyward was \r\n  convicted for kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree (â€œCSCâ€), \r\n  and carjacking.Â  Subsequently, the circuit court sentenced him to life imprisonment \r\n  without parole for kidnapping, life imprisonment without parole for CSC, and \r\n  fifteen years imprisonment for carjacking, the sentences to run concurrently.Â  \r\n  Heyward appeals, arguing the circuit court erred by failing to start the jury \r\n  selection process de novo, where the circuit court found a juror to have been \r\n  struck in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROECDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nA grand jury indicted Heyward for kidnapping, \r\n  CSC, and carjacking.Â  During jury selection, the State moved for a Batson \r\n  hearing, arguing Heywardâ€™s strikes were exercised in a gender-based, discriminatory \r\n  manner.Â  The circuit court agreed.Â  However, rather than strike the entire jury \r\n  and begin the jury selection process de novo, the circuit court seated the juror.Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing the trial, the jury found Heyward \r\n  guilty of kidnapping, CSC, and carjacking, and the circuit court sentenced him \r\n  to life imprisonment without parole for kidnapping, life imprisonment without \r\n  parole for CSC, and fifteen years imprisonment for carjacking, the sentences \r\n  to run concurrently.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Heywardâ€™s appellate counsel reviewed the record, \r\n  concluded the appeal lacked merit, and filed a petition to be relieved.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) and State v. Williams, \r\n  305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), this court reviewed the record and brief, \r\n  denied counselâ€™s request, and ordered the following issue to be briefed:\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in seating a juror, whom it found \r\n  to have been struck in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), \r\n  rather than ordering the process of selecting the jury to start de novo as set \r\n  forth in State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 58, 358 S.E.2d 701, 704 (1987), \r\n  abrogated on other grounds by State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, \r\n  454 S.E.2d 317 (1995)?Â Â  \r\n\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. Order dated June 11, 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHeyward argues the circuit court committed reversible \r\n  error by failing to strike the jury and start the jury selection process de \r\n  novo, where the circuit court found a juror to have been struck in violation \r\n  of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venireperson \r\n  on the basis of race.â€Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 628, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  88, 90 (1999); see Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 85 (1986) \r\n  (holding the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits \r\n  a state prosecutor from exercising peremptory challenges to strike potential \r\n  jurors solely on the basis of race); see also Georgia v. McCollum, \r\n  505 U.S. 42, 50-55 (1992) (holding a prosecutor may challenge a defendantâ€™s \r\n  use of peremptory strikes); J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. \r\n  127, 129 (1994) (holding the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \r\n  is violated if the State strikes a juror on the basis of gender).\r\nOur supreme court has set forth a â€œbright line \r\n  testâ€ for determining if a juror has been struck in violation of Batson.Â  \r\n  See State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 57-58, 358 S.E.2d 701, 703-04 \r\n  (1987), abrogated by, State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 306, \r\n  454 S.E.2d 317, 320 (1995)).Â  Furthermore, if the circuit court finds a juror \r\n  has been struck in violation of Batson, our supreme court has mandated \r\n  that the circuit court strike the entire jury and begin the jury selection process \r\n  de novo.Â  Id. at 58, 358 S.E.2d at 704.Â  This mandate seeks to:Â  1) protect \r\n  the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial; 2) protect each venirepersonâ€™s right \r\n  not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory reasons; and 3) preserve \r\n  public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice by seeking to eradicate \r\n  discrimination in the jury selection process.Â  Haigler, 334 S.C. at 628-29, \r\n  515 S.E.2d at 90.\r\nIn this case, forty-one qualified jurors were randomly \r\n  drawn from the jury pool, and their names were placed on a consecutively numbered \r\n  list.Â  The remaining jurors in the pool were then excused from the courtroom.Â  \r\n  Beginning with the first name on the list, the circuit court called out each \r\n  juror in order, giving first the State and then the defendant the right to strike \r\n  the juror.Â  The jurors did not know who was struck by either side.\r\nFollowing jury selection, both parties made a Batson \r\n  challenge.Â  All of Heywardâ€™s strikes removed female jurors, and the State asserted \r\n  his strikes were exercised in a gender-based, discriminatory fashion.Â  Ultimately, \r\n  the circuit court concluded Heywardâ€™s reason for striking the sixteenth juror \r\n  on the list was pretextual, finding it to be a gender-based discriminatory strike.Â  \r\n  However, rather than striking the entire jury, the circuit court seated the \r\n  juror.Â  \r\nHaving seated the sixteenth juror on the list as juror number \r\n  nine (â€œjuror number nineâ€™), the circuit court moved the last juror of the twelve-person \r\n  jury to the first alternate jurorâ€™s position, removing the last alternate juror \r\n  completely. [1] Â  The court then \r\n  revisited each of the three remaining jurors selected in the initial process \r\n  in their original order, noting that Heyward had the option of striking another \r\n  juror because the court had denied his strike of juror number nine.Â  Heyward \r\n  declined to strike any of the three remaining jurors included on the original \r\n  panel.Â  \r\nInitially, we agree the circuit court erred by \r\n  seating the juror in violation of Jones. [2] Â  However, this does not end our inquiry.Â  Rather, \r\n  we must determine whether a harmless error analysis is appropriate, and if so, \r\n  whether the error in this case was harmless.\r\nIn State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  357 (1995), the circuit court quashed a jury, finding the defendant struck a \r\n  juror in a discriminatory manner.Â  Subsequently, upon starting the jury selection \r\n  process de novo, the defendant attempted to strike the same juror again, and \r\n  the circuit court seated the juror.Â  Id. at 51, 456 S.E.2d at 359.Â  Our \r\n  supreme court affirmed, holding â€œâ€˜a partyâ€™s right to use peremptory challenges \r\n  can be subordinated to a venirepersonâ€™s constitutional right not to be improperly \r\n  removed from jury service.â€™â€Â  Id. at 52, 456 S.E.2d at 359-360 (quoting \r\n  Jefferson v. State, 595 So.2d 38, 41 (Fla. 1992)). \r\n  [3] \r\nSubsequently, in State v. Short, 333 S.C. \r\n  473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999), our supreme court, analyzing a Batson challenge, \r\n  ruled, â€œno showing of actual prejudice is required to find reversible error \r\n  for the denial or impairment of the right to a peremptory challenge.â€Â  \r\n  Short, 333 S.C. at 477, 511 S.E.2d at 360.Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAs we interpret Franklin, seating a juror \r\n  who has once been improperly struck by a party in violation of Batson \r\n  is not, in and of itself, an impairment or denial of that partyâ€™s right to peremptory \r\n  challenges.Â  Consequently, under the circumstance of this case, a harmless error \r\n  analysis is appropriate and does not offend State v. Short. \r\nViewing the facts of this case, in light of the above, \r\n  we conclude no prejudice resulted from the failure to select a jury de novo, \r\n  as Heywardâ€™s right to exercise peremptory strikes was not impaired, and the \r\n  selection process provided Heyward with the same choices he enjoyed in the first \r\n  instance, with the exception of the unconstitutional strike of juror number \r\n  nine.Â  Thus, under the limited circumstances of this case, we hold the error \r\n  was harmless. State v. Wright, 304 S.C. 529, 534, 405 S.E.2d 825, 828 \r\n  (1991) (ruling there is no prejudice to defendant where he received what Batson \r\n  was intended to provide); see also Franklin, 318 S.C. at \r\n  52, 456 S.E.2d at 360.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Heywardâ€™s conviction is \r\n  AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  No alternates were needed in the trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]  We note that in Jones, the solicitorâ€™s \r\n    juror strikes were the subject of challenge.Â  Jones 293 S.C. at 57, \r\n    358 S.E.2d at 703.Â  In pertinent part, the court stated that when â€œthe solicitor \r\n    has failed to give a racially neutral reason for the contested peremptory \r\n    strikes, the process of selecting the jury shall start de novo.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n    Thus, Jones did not deal with the situation in this case, in which \r\n    the party who improperly strikes a juror demands a de novo jury selection \r\n    as a result of his/her own impropriety.Â  However, absent further guidance \r\n    from our supreme court, we conclude Jones is controlling on the issue.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] \r\n    We recognize the facts in Franklin are dissimilar in that the seating \r\n    of the juror over defense objection occurred during the de novo selection \r\n    mandated by Jones.Â  In that regard, the Courtâ€™s ruling was limited \r\n    by those facts. See Franklin, 318 S.C. at 53, 456 S.E.2d at \r\n    360 (â€œWe hold once a new venire has been selected in compliance with Jones, \r\n    supra, â€˜that it is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion to fashion the appropriate \r\n    remedy under the particular facts of each case and, as long as neither partyâ€™s \r\n    constitutional rights are infringed, that remedy may include the seating of \r\n    an improperly challenged juror.â€™â€ (emphasis added) (quoting Jefferson, \r\n    595 So.2d at 47).Â  We also note the Court took pains not to undermine the \r\n    requirement of Jones. Id. (â€œOur decision today does not impact \r\n    Jones.â€).Â  However, the Court did recognize that Jones was not \r\n    intended to cover all situations. Id. (â€œJones did not consider \r\n    the case where a party attempts repeatedly to strike a prospective juror in \r\n    violation of Batson. We do not accept the argument that Jones \r\n    mandates . . . the trial judge in all instances to â€˜give the offending party \r\n    exactly what he wanted, namely,â€™ a jury panel which unconstitutionally excludes \r\n    a particular juror.â€) (quoting People v. Moten, 603 N.Y.S.2d 940, 947 \r\n    (N.Y.

Schmidt, III, Dwight F. Drake and C. Mitchell Brown, all of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\nJames T. Hewitt, of Greenville, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: Â Deloitte &amp; Touche, L.L.P. appeals a circuit court order \r\n  denying its motion seeking arbitration.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, Deloitte commenced an action \r\n  against Unisys Corporation based on a contractual dispute. Unisys then gave \r\n  notice of and filed a demand for arbitration. Unisys also subsequently moved \r\n  to have the case dismissed under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(8), SCRCP. At the \r\n  time, Deloitte was opposed to arbitration and argued against Unisysâ€™s arbitration \r\n  demand.Â  The circuit court held that Deloitte could not be forced to arbitrate \r\n  its claims against Unisys, reasoning that the arbitration provision of the contract \r\n  under which Unisys made its request was unenforceable under South Carolina law \r\n  and incapable of being â€œrescuedâ€ by the Federal Arbitration Act. [1] Â  Unisys appealed the ruling, but the appeal \r\n  was dismissed as being interlocutory and premature. \r\nFollowing the dismissal of the appeal, \r\n  the parties resumed litigation. That process has lasted for nearly five and \r\n  one-half years.Â  The discovery phase has generated thousands of documents and \r\n  numerous motions and hearings. A three-day â€œPhase Iâ€ bench trial was conducted, \r\n  where Deloitte was allowed to present one of its claims. \r\n  [2]  The trial judge ruled in favor of Unisys. Deloitte then moved for arbitration \r\n  in August 2002, shortly before Unisys was to present its counter-claims in â€œPhase \r\n  IIâ€ of the trial. Deloitte asserted that it could â€œjoinâ€ Unisys in â€œvoluntary \r\n  arbitrationâ€ since Unisys had continued to maintain an open file with the American \r\n  Arbitration Association even after its demand for arbitration was denied. \r\nThe trial judge denied Deloitteâ€™s motion \r\n  for arbitration on August 15, 2002. He found Deloitteâ€™s motion to be duplicative \r\n  of Unisysâ€™s 1997 motion to compel arbitration. The trial judge reasoned that \r\n  Deloitte, having successfully contested Unisysâ€™s motion nearly six years earlier, \r\n  could not now argue in favor of arbitration.Â  In the alternative, the trial \r\n  judge found that Deloitte waived its right to seek arbitration by litigating \r\n  the case for five and one-half years.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial judge err in finding Deloitteâ€™s motion duplicative of Unisysâ€™s \r\n  1997 motion to compel arbitration?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Did the trial judge err in holding that Deloitte waived its right to seek arbitration \r\n  by engaging in the litigation process?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&nbsp;â€œThe question of the arbitrability of \r\n  a claim is an issue for judicial determinationÂ  . . . [and is] subject to de \r\n  novo review.â€ Stokes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 606, 609, \r\n  571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002) (citation omitted). However, the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s factual findings underlying the ruling will be disturbed only if there \r\n  is no evidence to reasonably support them.Â  Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton, \r\n  336 S.C. 658, 664, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Arbitration Motion&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nDeloitte argues that the trial judge erred in finding its \r\n  motion duplicative of Unisysâ€™s 1997 motion to compel arbitration.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Deloitte contends that the 1997 order merely held that Unisys could not force \r\n  Deloitte into arbitration under the arbitration clause in the contract, not \r\n  that the parties could not voluntarily arbitrate their dispute.Â  Therefore, \r\n  according to Deloitte, the 1997 order has â€œno effect in an instance, such as \r\n  this, where the parties agree to arbitrate.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nWe note at the outset that if Unisys were willing \r\n  to arbitrate the dispute, this current appeal would not exist.Â  In fact, Unisys \r\n  stated in its brief that there has not been an â€œopen invitationâ€ to arbitrate \r\n  from Unisys since the 1997 order. Indeed, the trial judge found in his 2002 \r\n  order that â€œ[t]he arbitration has been inactive and dormant for five and one-half \r\n  years, and the parties have not conducted any activity in that forum pursuant \r\n  to the ruling of [the circuit court] in 1997.â€Â  Deloitte maintains that parties \r\n  to a dispute reserve the right to choose arbitration even after the start of \r\n  litigation. And that may well be true. But such is not the case here. Unisys \r\n  wanted arbitration, but Deloitte opposed it. Unisys was forced to comply with \r\n  that wish following the circuit courtâ€™s 1997 ruling. That Unisys has â€œnever \r\n  withdrawn its demand for arbitrationâ€ is immaterial since the motion was denied. \r\n  Given that no arbitration is currently taking place between the parties, what \r\n  Deloitte is attempting to do here is to force Unisys into arbitration under \r\n  the contractual clause the circuit court found unenforceable in 1997. \r\n  [3]  We decline to do so. \r\nWe find that the trial judge did not err in ruling that Deloitteâ€™s \r\n  motion was duplicative of Unisysâ€™s 1997 motion to compel arbitration.\r\nII.Â  Waiver\r\nDeloitte also argues that the trial judge erred \r\n  in finding that Deloitte waived its right to arbitrate.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nâ€œIt is generally held that the right to enforce \r\n  an arbitration clause may be waived.â€ Liberty Builders, 336 S.C. at 665, \r\n  521 S.E.2d at 753 (citation omitted). â€œThere is no set rule as to what constitutes \r\n  a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the question depends on the facts of each \r\n  case.&quot; Id. To establish that there has been a waiver, a party must \r\n  show it has been unduly burdened by the other partyâ€™s delay in seeking arbitration.Â  \r\n  Sentry Engâ€™g &amp; Constr., Inc. v. Marinerâ€™s Cay Dev. Corp., 287 S.C. \r\n  346, 351, 338 S.E.2d 631, 634 (1985). \r\nThe trial judge relied primarily on Liberty Builders \r\n  in concluding that Deloitte waived its right to seek arbitration. There, the \r\n  parties sought assistance from the trial court on numerous occasions, and submitted \r\n  several motions, including motions to amend, compel, add parties, and dismiss. \r\n  Liberty Builders, 336 S.C. at 666, 521 S.E.2d at 753. Those proceedings \r\n  lasted for more than two years. Id. The time and work necessary to resolve \r\n  these motions resulted in substantial attorneysâ€™ fees for the non-moving party.Â  \r\n  This Court found that the non-moving party was prejudiced by the delay and that \r\n  the moving party had â€œwaived its right to enforce the arbitration clause by \r\n  submitting the dispute to the court and availing itself of that system for two \r\n  and one-half years.â€Â  Id. at 668, 521 S.E.2d at 754.\r\nIn the current case, Deloitte has availed itself of the litigation \r\n  process for approximately five and one-half years.Â  The parties have conducted \r\n  a significant amount of discovery, resulting in the production of thousands \r\n  of documents.Â  Significantly, Deloitte has also been permitted to try one of \r\n  its claims against Unisys.Â  Therefore, just like the non-moving party in Liberty \r\n  Builders, Unisys, the non-moving party here, has been prejudiced since it \r\n  was forced to start and maintain the litigation process. The trial judge was \r\n  correct in finding that Deloitte waived its right to seek arbitration.\r\nDeloitte argues that Liberty Builders is not controlling \r\n  because that defendant had not repeatedly argued that the dispute should be \r\n  arbitrated; it was only the plaintiff that belatedly demanded arbitration.Â  \r\n  We find this factual difference to be inconsequential.Â  Deloitte could have \r\n  submitted its case for arbitration when Unisys first sought arbitration in 1997.Â  \r\n  In fact, Deloitte could have chosen arbitration at any time, but it did not.Â  \r\n  Instead, after pursuing litigation for nearly six years, culminating in an unsuccessful \r\n  trial, Deloitte now wants to compel Unisys to arbitrate. That, it cannot do. \r\n\r\n CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.A.

Ellisor, of Lexington, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nCynthia Barrier Castengera, of Newland, N.C.; J. Mark Taylor \r\n  and C. Vance Stricklin, Jr., both of West Columbia, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â Â  LaRue D. Penny, Jr. (Husband) \r\n  and Sally Z. Green (Wife) both appeal from a family court order reducing Husbandâ€™s \r\n  child support and alimony obligations.Â  Husband also appeals Wifeâ€™s award of \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were divorced in February 1998.Â  \r\n  The family court judge adopted the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement and ordered \r\n  Husband to pay $2,750 per month in alimony until May 2002, with incremental \r\n  decreases after that date.Â  Husband was also ordered to pay $1,500 per month \r\n  in child support until May 2002, with the amount decreasing to $1,000 per month \r\n  after that date.\r\nIn 1999, between the \r\n  divorce and the initiation of this action, Wife moved to Atlanta with the children.Â  \r\n  In the fall of 2000, Husband left his Columbia pediatric practice and moved \r\n  to Atlanta, in part to be closer to his children.Â  Another factor in his relocation \r\n  was that Husband remarried and his current wifeâ€™s two children also live near \r\n  Atlanta. [1] Â  Husband filed this \r\n  action for a reduction in his support obligations, claiming his financial circumstances \r\n  had changed significantly.Â  Wife answered, denying Husband was entitled to a \r\n  decrease, and requested an increase in alimony, admonishment of Husband for \r\n  late support payments, enforcement of Husbandâ€™s debt payment obligations under \r\n  the divorce decree, and payment of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nIn the 1998 divorce \r\n  proceeding approving the partiesâ€™ agreement, Husbandâ€™s sworn financial declaration \r\n  stated his annual income wasÂ  $140,000.Â  In this action for a reduction, however, \r\n  Husband claimed his income at the time of the divorce was actually $165,226.Â  \r\n  He testified that his new employment in Atlanta provided him with a minimum \r\n  salary of $100,000, based on a three-day work week.\r\nFollowing a merits hearing, the \r\n  family court reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation to $2,000 per month and set \r\n  his child support obligation at $1,206 per month. \r\n  [2] Â  The family court based its decision to grant Husband a reduction on \r\n  Husbandâ€™s decreased income, finding Husband had actually earned $168,996 [3]  at the time of the divorce and imputing a salary of $120,000 \r\n  to Husband at the time of this action. Â The family court also awarded \r\n  Wife the value of $24,627 in attorneyâ€™s fees by directing Husband to pay $7,000 \r\n  in addition to the offset credit from his support overage.Â  Wife appeals both \r\n  orders, arguing the family court erred in reducing Husbandâ€™s support obligations.Â  \r\n  Husband appeals the final order, arguing the family court should have further \r\n  reduced his support obligations and asserting that the court should have awarded \r\n  him, not Wife, attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this \r\n  court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither is the court required \r\n  to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight \r\n  to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d \r\n  541, 541 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s appeal\r\nWife argues the family court erred in reducing Husbandâ€™s \r\n  child support obligation at the temporary hearing and in reducing Husbandâ€™s \r\n  alimony and child support obligations at the final hearing.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œFamily courts are empowered to modify child support \r\n  upon a proper showing of a change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting \r\n  parentâ€™s financial ability.â€Â  Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 196, \r\n  379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989) (citation omitted); see Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. at 477, 279 S.E.2d at 617 (finding the issue of child support is subject \r\n  to continuing review by the family court).Â  â€œTo warrant a modification in child \r\n  support, the change of circumstances must be either substantial or material.â€Â  \r\n  Fischbach v. Tuttle, 302 S.C. 555, 557, 397 S.E.2d 773, 774 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990).\r\nSimilarly, to justify modification of an alimony \r\n  award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  Thornton \r\n  v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997); see also \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985) (stating that changed conditions may warrant \r\n  a modification or termination of alimony).Â  Further, the change in circumstances \r\n  must be unanticipated.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d \r\n  727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Several considerations relevant to the initial determination \r\n  of alimony may be applied in the modification context as well, including the \r\n  partiesâ€™ standard of living during the marriage, each partyâ€™s earning capacity, \r\n  and the supporting spouseâ€™s ability to continue to support the other spouse.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nWe find Husband failed to show a substantial or \r\n  material change in circumstances.Â  The family courtâ€™s decision to reduce Husbandâ€™s \r\n  support was ostensibly based on two reasons, both of which we find to be erroneous.Â  \r\n  First, the family court found that Wifeâ€™s income had increased at the time of \r\n  the final hearing.Â  At the time of the divorce, Wifeâ€™s 1997 financial declaration \r\n  stated her gross monthly income was $1,273, and, at the time of the present \r\n  action, her 2001 financial declaration indicates monthly income of $2,269.92.Â  \r\n  It was error to base a reduction on this ground, however, because such a change \r\n  was expected.Â  By agreement of the parties, Husbandâ€™s alimony payments were \r\n  to be reduced over time, beginning only six months after the final order granting \r\n  modification.Â  Although the divorce decree does not explain the reason for the \r\n  automatic decreases in Husbandâ€™s support obligations, the record supports the \r\n  family courtâ€™s finding that they were in anticipation of Wife increasing her \r\n  income.Â  It thus was error for the family court judge to grant Husband a reduction \r\n  on this basis.Â  See, e.g., Brown v. Brown, 278 S.C. 43, \r\n  44, 292 S.E.2d 297, 297 (1982) (finding that while the wifeâ€™s income increased \r\n  since the divorce, this increase cannot be used to justify a reduction in alimony \r\n  because it was contemplated by the parties at the time of the divorce).Â Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s second basis for reducing support \r\n  was the Husbandâ€™s reduction in reported income.Â  We find, however, that Husbandâ€™s \r\n  reduced income failed to constitute a substantial change impacting his ability \r\n  to pay the obligations to which he originally agreed.Â  This conclusion is based \r\n  on our review of the family courtâ€™s analysis of the Husbandâ€™s initial income, \r\n  his current income, and his imputed income.\r\nFinancial declarations are sworn documents required \r\n  by Rule 20 of the South Carolina Rules of Family Court.Â  Here the family court, \r\n  which approved the partiesâ€™ agreement in February 1998, relied on Husbandâ€™s \r\n  representation of $140,000 in annual income, as reflected in his financial declaration.Â  \r\n  In this action for reduction, however, Husband testified his income in 1997 \r\n  had been under-reported by him and that it was actually $165,226.Â  The family \r\n  court then utilized this inflated figure as support for its decision to reduce \r\n  Husbandâ€™s support obligation, finding that Husbandâ€™s income had decreased substantially \r\n  since the 1998 divorce.Â  This was error.\r\nA party cannot misrepresent income and expenses \r\n  on a financial declaration for purposes of having an agreement approved and \r\n  then refute the accuracy of that document in a subsequent modification action.Â  \r\n  SeeÂ  Rogers v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 332, 540 S.E.2d 840, 841 \r\n  (2001) (relying on original financial declaration rather than other records \r\n  indicating an increased income in evaluating change of circumstances); see \r\n  also Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 336 S.E.2d 884 (Ct. App. 1985) \r\n  (concluding husband was barred by res judicata from subsequent \r\n  challenge of cost of living index incorporated in divorce decree).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find the family court erred in allowing Husband to contradict his previous \r\n  financial declaration in an effort to demonstrate a larger disparity from his \r\n  present income.Â  It was error for the family court to utilize Husbandâ€™s inflated \r\n  income of $168,996 rather than relying on the figure of $140,000 reported in \r\n  Husbandâ€™s original financial declaration.Â  We find the correct annual income \r\n  to attribute to Husband for purposes of evaluating his claim of changed circumstance \r\n  is $140,000, as reflected in his 1998 financial declaration.\r\nRegarding Husbandâ€™s current income, we believe \r\n  the family court was correct in imputing to Husband an annual income of $120,000, \r\n  rather than the $100,000 per year urged by Husband.Â Â  Initially we note that \r\n  Husbandâ€™s purported salary with his new practice in Atlanta is based on a one-year \r\n  contract that guarantees him a minimum of $100,000, based on a three-day work \r\n  week. \r\nMoreover, under the Child Support Guidelines, â€œincomeâ€ \r\n  is defined as â€œthe actual gross income of the parent, if employed to full capacity, \r\n  or potential income if unemployed or underemployed.â€Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. \r\n  114-4720(A)(1) (Supp. 2002).Â  The Guidelines provide further that â€œ[i]n order \r\n  to impute income to a parent who is unemployed or underemployed, the court should \r\n  determine the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent \r\n  based on that parentâ€™s recent work history, occupational qualifications, and \r\n  prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 114-4720(A)(5)(b).Â  Where a parent voluntarily lessens his or her earning \r\n  capacity, this court will closely scrutinize the facts to determine the parentâ€™s \r\n  capacity to earn, rather than his or her actual earnings.Â  See Robinson \r\n  v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 363, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\nÂ We recognize that following the partiesâ€™ divorce, \r\n  Husbandâ€™s medical practice underwent some detrimental financial changes. We \r\n  agree with the family courtâ€™s conclusion that Husbandâ€™s salary in Columbia before \r\n  he moved to Atlanta was roughly $120,000 per year.Â  This conclusion is supported \r\n  by Husbandâ€™s 1999 W-2 indicating his salary was approximately $130,000, and \r\n  his 2000 W-2 showing his salary at approximately $118,000.Â  The family court \r\n  correctly noted the recent reduction in Husbandâ€™s salary was brought about by \r\n  Husbandâ€™s voluntary decision to leave his Columbia medical practice and move \r\n  to Atlanta.Â  We reiterate that Husbandâ€™s purported $100,000 salary from his \r\n  Atlanta medical practice is a guaranteed minimum salary and is achieved by working \r\n  only three days per week.Â  When a spouse voluntarily undertakes a move that \r\n  will reduce his or her income, the family court may properly impute income to \r\n  that spouse.Â  Id.Â  The family courtâ€™s imputation of income to Husband \r\n  was tantamount to finding Husband underemployed.Â  As such, the court was justified \r\n  in examining Husbandâ€™s earning potential based upon recent work history and \r\n  qualifications.Â  Since Husband was earning approximately $120,000 before he \r\n  voluntarily moved to Atlanta, the family court did not err in imputing that \r\n  level of income to him.Â  This is especially true considering Husbandâ€™s current \r\n  job in Atlanta seems to allow Husband the opportunity to work more hours and \r\n  increase his annual salary.\r\nComparing Husbandâ€™s initial income to the income properly \r\n  imputed to him, Husbandâ€™s annual salary has decreased from $140,000 to $120,000.Â  \r\n  We find this decrease is not significant enough to severely impact his standard \r\n  of living or his ability to pay support obligations, particularly where that \r\n  decrease is due to a voluntary relocation.Â  See Townsend v. Townsend, \r\n  356 S.C. 70, 587 S.E.2d 118 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding that husbandâ€™s decrease \r\n  in income from $250,000 to $186,000 per year without showing of inability to \r\n  pay support obligations is not a substantial change in circumstances); Kielar \r\n  v. Kielar, 311 S.C. 466, 429 S.E. 2d 851 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating that involuntary \r\n  resignation resulting in a salary decrease from over $300,000 to roughly $180,000 \r\n  per year did not amount to substantial change in circumstances because it had \r\n  no impact on standard of living and ability to pay obligations).Â  Because there \r\n  was no substantial change in circumstances sufficient to support a reduction \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s alimony and child support obligation, we find the family court \r\n  erred in reducing Husbandâ€™s support obligations.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s \r\n  decision is reversed, and the partiesâ€™ previous alimony and child support agreement \r\n  as incorporated in the 1998 divorce decree is reinstated.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s appeal\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in not further \r\n  decreasing or terminating his alimony obligation.Â  Husband also contends the \r\n  family court erred in imputing to him a $120,000 annual income.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs discussed above, we find the family court erred \r\n  in reducing Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  Therefore, we cannot find, as Husband \r\n  argues, that the court did not reduce his obligation enough.Â  As also \r\n  explained above, we believe the family court was correct in imputing to Husband \r\n  an annual income of $120,000.Â  Thus, we find no merit to either one of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  alleged errors regarding his support obligations.\r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to \r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees in his favor.Â  Further, Husband argues the family court \r\n  erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nBefore awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court \r\n  should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the \r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial \r\n  conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard \r\n  of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 \r\n  (1992).Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be overturned absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d \r\n  901, 903 (1988).Â Â  \r\nWe find the family court was correct in granting \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife and not to Husband.Â  Though Wifeâ€™s annual income has \r\n  nearly doubled since the partiesâ€™ divorce in 1997, Husband has a much greater \r\n  earning potential as a pediatrician.Â  As such, Husband is clearly more able \r\n  to pay both his own attorneyâ€™s fees and those accrued by Wife.Â  Along those \r\n  lines, Husbandâ€™s standard of living will be better able to absorb the fees in \r\n  view of his income.Â  Finally and most importantly, Wife has now prevailed in \r\n  the Husbandâ€™s attempt to alter the support obligations.Â  Accordingly, the family \r\n  court judge did not err in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to her.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ The family courtâ€™s temporary and final orders decreasing \r\n  Husbandâ€™s child support and alimony obligations based on change of circumstances \r\n  are reversed, thereby reinstating the alimony and child support plan outlined \r\n  in the divorce decree of February 6, 1998.Â  We remand this matter to the family \r\n  court for a determination of alimony and child support arrearages.Â  The award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife is affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Husbandâ€™s current wife, while living in Columbia, earned between $20,000 \r\n    and $54,000 per year working as a registered nurse.

Hatfield, individually, and on behalf of the Hyman Law Firm, brought an action \r\n  against Susan Van Epps to recover attorney's fees she owed Law Firm. Van Epps \r\n  filed a counterclaim, asserting legal malpractice. Van Epps appeals the trial \r\n  judge's decision to grant a directed verdict in Law Firm's favor on a portion \r\n  of her malpractice cause of action and from the jury verdict, asserting the \r\n  trial judge made numerous errors. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nVan Epps and Leslie Stewart were \r\n  married in 1982. Both are physicians. The couple had two sons, born in 1987 \r\n  and 1989. They separated in 1995, and Stewart filed for divorce that same year. \r\n  On June 5, 1995, Van Epps hired Evander Jeffords of the Hyman Law Firm to represent \r\n  her in the divorce. At the time of the divorce, Stewart was a member of Pee \r\n  Dee Surgical Group. When Van Epps hired Jeffords, he was also representing a \r\n  senior partner of the Pee Dee Group, Dr. Bolick, in his divorce. \r\nPursuant to Law Firm's recommendation, \r\n  Van Epps obtained twenty affidavits from witnesses favoring her on the issue \r\n  of child custody. Van Epps was awarded custody at the temporary hearing. At \r\n  the divorce trial, Law Firm failed to call any witnesses to testify on Van Epps' \r\n  behalf on the custody issue. In fact, of the three witnesses besides Van Epps \r\n  who were called by Law Firm, two testified in support of its claim for attorney's \r\n  fees. 1 \r\nIn assessing the value of the Pee \r\n  Dee Group for purposes of equitable distribution, Jeffords suggested Van Epps \r\n  use Carroll Webster, a CPA whom Jeffords was also using in Bolick's divorce \r\n  action. At the time Jeffords selected him to perform the valuation for Van Epps, \r\n  Webster was performing personal accounting work for Van Epps and Stewart, and \r\n  he was also the CPA for Pee Dee Surgical Group. Webster used two contracts signed \r\n  by the members of the Pee Dee Group, a Stockholder Redemption Agreement and \r\n  a Salary Continuation Agreement2, in order to value the practice for the Bolick \r\n  divorce. Jeffords asked Webster to use the same formula in his valuation of \r\n  the medical practice for Van Epps' divorce. \r\nStewart filed his action for divorce \r\n  in June of 1995. The merits hearing was held on April 15 and 16, and May 28 \r\n  - 30, 1996. The only expert valuation of the Pee Dee Surgical Group introduced \r\n  at trial came from Webster, who testified the practice had a value of approximately \r\n  $52,000, using the Salary Continuation Agreement, and a value of $665, using \r\n  the formula set forth in the Shareholder Redemption Agreement. Stewart averred \r\n  in his financial declaration that the value of the practice was zero.\r\nThe family court ultimately granted \r\n  Van Epps a divorce based on Stewart's adultery. The court granted Stewart custody \r\n  of the parties' two children and ordered Van Epps to pay child support of $2,500 \r\n  per month. The family court adopted Webster's value of $52,258.00 for the practice. \r\n  On March 15, 1996, one month prior to the first day of the merits hearing, a \r\n  Stock Purchase Agreement was executed between McLeod Physician Services, Inc., \r\n  and the four shareholders of the Pee Dee Surgical Group whereby McLeod agreed \r\n  to purchase Stewart's practice for 3.1 million dollars. Pursuant to the contract, \r\n  the closing was scheduled for March 14, 1997. Stewart ultimately received $775,000 \r\n  for his interest pursuant to the sale. \r\nLaw Firm commenced this action in \r\n  November of 1998 to recover attorney's fees from Van Epps in the sum of $52,120. \r\n  Van Epps counterclaimed, alleging Law Firm was negligent in its representation \r\n  in her divorce. She claims Law Firm failed to present numerous witnesses regarding \r\n  the custody issue, failed to obtain a proper valuation of the Pee Dee Surgical \r\n  Group, and failed to inform her of a conflict of interest. The trial judge directed \r\n  a verdict in favor of Law Firm on the custody issue and sent the remaining issues \r\n  to the jury. After an Allen3 charge, the jury found for Law Firm, awarding it \r\n  $52,120 in attorney's fees, and found in favor of Law Firm on Van Epps' counterclaim. \r\n  After a successful request for pre-judgment interest of $18,100 on the original \r\n  attorney's fees, Law Firm was awarded an additional $19,090.37 in attorney's \r\n  fees and costs. Under the trial judge's order, the judgment against Van Epps \r\n  totaled $89,310.37. Van Epps appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Child Custody\r\nVan Epps argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in directing a verdict in favor of Law Firm on the claim of legal malpractice \r\n  regarding the child custody issue. We agree. \r\nVan Epps contends the trial judge \r\n  erred in directing a verdict in Law Firm's favor where there was evidence that \r\n  Law Firm's breach of the duty owed to her was the proximate cause of child custody \r\n  being granted to Stewart. When reviewing an order granting a directed verdict, \r\n  this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against \r\n  whom the verdict was granted. Carson v. Adgar, 326 S.C. 212, 216, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 3, 5 (1997).\r\nIt is undisputed that at the final \r\n  divorce hearing, Law Firm did not call any witnesses, other than Van Epps herself, \r\n  in support of her claim for custody. Stanley Feldman, an attorney, testified \r\n  for Van Epps as an expert witness. He opined Law Firm deviated from the standard \r\n  of care by failing to call any witnesses on Van Epps' behalf. According to Feldman: \r\n  &quot;[Law Firm's] failure to call witnesses in this case fell below the standard, \r\n  made the performance, or made the work below the standard in all fairness.&quot; \r\n  He also testified that: &quot;I think there has been a deviation from the standard \r\n  of care in the failure to present those witnesses and failure to present a proper \r\n  custody case.&quot; In response to Van Epps' counsel's question as to whether \r\n  he had an opinion as to &quot;most probably whether or not the failure to call \r\n  those witnesses was a contributing proximate cause &#133; to the loss of her \r\n  children,&quot; Feldman responded, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; No motion was made \r\n  to strike Feldman's testimony.\r\nAt the conclusion of Van Epps' case, \r\n  Law Firm moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the evidence failed \r\n  to establish that Law Firm's breach of duty to Van Epps was the proximate cause \r\n  of any damages. The trial judge ruled that because Feldman did not testify that \r\n  Law Firm's deviation from the standard of care most probably caused her to lose \r\n  custody, the evidence was not sufficient to submit the claim to the jury. \r\n In granting Law Firm's motion for \r\n  a directed verdict, the trial judge relied on Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; \r\n  Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991). There, the supreme court stated \r\n  that &quot;before expert testimony is admissible upon the question of the causal \r\n  connection between plaintiff's injuries and the acts of the defendant, the testimony \r\n  must satisfy the 'most probably' rule.&quot; Id. at 111, 410 S.E.2d at 543. \r\n  Nevertheless, the Baughman decision also specifically holds that: &quot;In determining \r\n  whether particular evidence meets this test it is not necessary that the expert \r\n  actually use the words 'most probably.' It is sufficient that the testimony \r\n  is such 'as to judicially impress that the opinion &#133; represents his professional \r\n  judgment as to the most likely one among the possible causes.'&quot; Id. (quoting \r\n  Norland v. Washington General Hospital, 461 F.2d 694, 697 (8th Cir. 1972)).\r\nFeldman fell short of testifying \r\n  that Law Firm's failure to call any witnesses, other than Van Epps, on the issue \r\n  of custody was the sole cause of her loss of custody; however, this was not \r\n  necessary in order to withstand Law Firm's motion for directed verdict. See \r\n  Sims v. Hall, Op. No. 3703 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 8, 2003) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 43 at 60) (&quot;Proximate cause does not mean the sole cause. \r\n  The defendant's conduct can be a proximate cause if it was at least one of the \r\n  direct, concurring causes of the injury.&quot;). While expert testimony is normally \r\n  required in a professional negligence action to establish both the standard \r\n  of care and the defendant's failure to conform to that standard, Feldman's testimony \r\n  satisfied that requirement. Feldman clearly testified that Law Firm deviated \r\n  from the standard of care in representing Van Epps and that this breach of care \r\n  was a contributing proximate cause in the loss of custody of her children. This \r\n  evidence was sufficient to create a jury issue as to whether the alleged breach \r\n  of the standard of care proximately caused damage to Van Epps. Stallings v. \r\n  Ratliff, 292 S.C. 349, 353, 356 S.E.2d 414, 417 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;The issue \r\n  of breach of duty does not turn on a ritual incantation of certain magic words \r\n  by an expert witness. Breach of duty is a fact question to be decided by the \r\n  jury on the evidence presented in each case.&quot;). \r\nThe trial judge erred in refusing \r\n  to submit the issue of Law Firm's negligence in its handling of Van Epps' custody \r\n  claim to the jury. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this issue for a new trial.\r\n\r\nII. Child Custody Affidavits\r\nVan Epps also argues the trial judge \r\n  erred in failing to allow the custody affidavits into evidence. We agree.\r\nAs noted earlier, Van Epps procured \r\n  twenty affidavits which were submitted to the family court at the temporary \r\n  hearing. Van Epps attempted to introduce these affidavits into evidence in this \r\n  action. The trial judge sustained Law Firm's objection to their introduction \r\n  on the basis of hearsay. This was error.\r\nIt is well settled that a statement \r\n  that is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted should not be \r\n  excluded as hearsay. R &amp; G Constr., Inc., v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., \r\n  343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000). These affidavits were \r\n  not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that Van Epps should \r\n  have been awarded custody of the parties' two children. Rather, they were offered \r\n  to show the extent of Law Firm's alleged negligence in failing to call any of \r\n  these witnesses at the final hearing. Although the trial judge ultimately agreed \r\n  with Van Epps' counsel that the affidavits were not being offered for the truth \r\n  of the matter asserted and were, therefore, not hearsay, the judge nevertheless \r\n  inexplicably refused to admit them, ruling instead that Van Epps should offer \r\n  a compilation of the affiants' names and the dates of each affidavit. \r\nWe hold that Van Epps was entitled \r\n  to introduce these affidavits into evidence to show the extent of Law Firm's \r\n  alleged negligence in failing to call any witnesses on her behalf at the custody \r\n  trial. The trial judge erred in sustaining Law Firm's objection on the basis \r\n  of hearsay.\r\n   \r\nIII. Business Valuation\r\nVan Epps claims it was error for \r\n  the trial judge to deny her directed verdict motion on the legal malpractice \r\n  issue regarding the value of the Pee Dee Group because the evidence showed Law \r\n  Firm did not present a proper business valuation. We disagree. \r\nThis court must affirm the denial \r\n  of a directed verdict motion when there is any evidence to support the ruling \r\n  below. Pike v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 332 S.C. 605, 610, 506 S.E.2d 516, 518 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998), aff'd as modified, 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000). During \r\n  the trial, Harry Wilson, an attorney, testified as to the standard of care of \r\n  family law attorneys. When asked whether he believed Law Firm deviated from \r\n  this standard of care in its efforts to value the Pee Dee Surgical Group, Wilson \r\n  stated, &quot;I do not believe that [Law Firm] has deviated from the standard \r\n  of care in regards to this business valuation.&quot; Although Van Epps' expert \r\n  disputed Webster's business valuation, Wilson's testimony was some evidence \r\n  that Law Firm did not breach the standard of care regarding the valuation. Therefore, \r\n  the denial of the directed verdict motion was proper.4 \r\n\r\nIV. Sale of the Pee Dee Surgical \r\n  Group\r\nVan Epps contends the trial judge \r\n  erred in refusing to allow into evidence the amount of the sale of the Pee Dee \r\n  Surgical Group to McLeod Hospital. We agree. \r\nThe trial judge, relying on McElveen \r\n  v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 506 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1998), ruled in limine \r\n  that the amount of the sale of the surgical practice to McLeod was not relevant \r\n  to the issue of the value of Stewart's practice for the purposes of marital \r\n  litigation. Moreover, the trial judge ruled that even if the evidence were relevant, \r\n  it would be highly prejudicial, and therefore inadmissible. We hold this was \r\n  error.\r\nMarital property is to be identified \r\n  and valued as of the date the marital litigation is filed or commenced. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-473 (Supp. 2002); Mallett v. Mallett, 323 \r\n  S.C. 141, 151, 473 S.E.2d 804 810 (Ct. App. 1996). However, it is equally well \r\n  settled that the parties to domestic litigation are entitled to share in any \r\n  appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation but \r\n  before divorce. See McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 497 n. 7, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  365, 369 n. 7 (1999) (&quot;We know of no authority, and the husband does not \r\n  cite any, that holds that only one spouse is entitled to any appreciation in \r\n  marital assets that occurs after the parties separate and before the parties \r\n  are divorced. We would think both parties would be entitled to any such appreciation.&quot;); \r\n  Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 187, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n  (affirming family court judge's decision to value stock in three businesses \r\n  as of December 31, 1997, the closest date to the parties' December 12, 1997, \r\n  divorce rather than as of the date of filing); Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. \r\n  222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;It is an unfortunate reality \r\n  that, given the volume of cases handled by our family courts, there often is \r\n  a substantial delay between the commencement of an action and its ultimate resolution. \r\n  Thus, it is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change, sometimes \r\n  substantially, between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution. \r\n  In such a case, the family court has the ability to consider the post-filing \r\n  appreciation or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.&quot;); \r\n  Mallett, 323 S.C. at 141, 473 S.E.2d at 804 (affirming valuation of husband's \r\n  business at time of final hearing where business had declined in value by more \r\n  than $30,000 since commencement of the action). \r\nGiven these authorities, the trial \r\n  judge erred in ruling that the evidence relating to the sale of the medical \r\n  practice was not relevant to the issue of the value of Stewart's practice for \r\n  purposes of the marital litigation. Moreover, to the extent the trial judge \r\n  based his decision on relevancy on the McElveen decision, it was also \r\n  in error. \r\nFirst, it must be noted that the \r\n  issue of the valuation of the husband's interest in his medical practice in \r\n  McElveen did not involve the question of the relevancy of any \r\n  evidence; rather, the McElveen court had to determine what evidence was \r\n  most probative on the issue of valuation. In McElveen, the parties stipulated \r\n  during the trial that the fair market value of husband's interest in his medical \r\n  practice was $250,000, specifically noting that the stipulation was reached \r\n  independently of substantially conflicting experts' opinions. Subsequent to \r\n  the trial but before the family court issued its decree, the wife moved to set \r\n  aside the trial stipulation as to the value of the husband's interest, to re-open \r\n  the evidence on this issue, and for sanctions. This motion was based on previously \r\n  undisclosed negotiations to sell the medical practice. The family court granted \r\n  the wife leave to undertake discovery pursuant to the post-trial motion and \r\n  reserved ruling on the issue of the medical practice valuation pending completion \r\n  of discovery. The family court found that negotiations to sell the husband's \r\n  medical practice did in fact begin prior to the time of the stipulation, that \r\n  they were relevant, and that they should have been disclosed during the original \r\n  discovery process. McElveen, 332 S.C. at 590, 506 S.E.2d at 5. As a result, \r\n  the family court set aside the parties' stipulation and re-opened the case for \r\n  the limited purpose of taking evidence on the issue of the fair market value \r\n  of the practice. Ultimately, the family court found that although negotiations \r\n  to sell the practice had taken place, a 1987 stock purchase agreement among \r\n  the shareholder-physicians was controlling on the issue of the valuation of \r\n  the husband's interest in the practice. Even though the value of the husband's \r\n  interest as calculated by the 1987 stock purchase agreement was less than the \r\n  value the parties had stipulated during the trial, the family court determined \r\n  the stipulated value was the correct value to be used in the division of the \r\n  marital property. \r\n Both parties in McElveen \r\n  appealed the issue of the valuation of the husband's interest in the medical \r\n  practice to this court, with the wife contending that the family court erred \r\n  in refusing to find that the letter of intent to purchase the medical group \r\n  for $19,800,652 was controlling as to the value of the husband's interest, and \r\n  the husband arguing that the family court erred in valuing his interest in the \r\n  practice in an amount exceeding the $183,000 stock purchase price established \r\n  by the 1987 stock purchase agreement. This court held the unaccepted offer to \r\n  purchase the entire practice was of little probative value, and the most probative \r\n  evidence of the value of the husband's interest in the medical practice was \r\n  derived from the 1987 stock purchase agreement. 332 S.C. at 593-594, 506 S.E.2d \r\n  at 6. \r\nImportantly, the stock purchase agreement \r\n  in McElveen, which we found probative, was exclusive. In other words, \r\n  Dr. McElveen was restricted by the terms of the agreement from transferring \r\n  his shares in the practice other than as computed by the formula set forth in \r\n  the agreement. In this case, the salary continuation agreement merely required \r\n  Dr. Stewart to give notice and a right of first refusal to his partners, but \r\n  the method of valuation was not limited to an exclusive formula unless no bona \r\n  fide offer from a third party existed. We held in McElveen that once \r\n  the family court set aside the stipulation, it was error for the court to return \r\n  to the value proposed in the stipulation without some evidence to support that \r\n  figure. Accordingly, we held the family court's decision to value the husband's \r\n  interest at the stipulated value of $250,000 rather than pursuant to the terms \r\n  of the 1987 stock purchase agreement was not supported by the evidence. We certainly \r\n  did not hold, however, that such an agreement was the only way to value \r\n  a medical practice or that other evidence of value was inadmissible. See \r\n  id. at 594, 506 S.E.2d at 6 (&quot;We do not intend by our holding to suggest \r\n  that a stock purchase agreement, where applicable, will always provide the best \r\n  evidence of fair market value. Our holding as to the determinative nature of \r\n  the stock purchase agreement in this case should be viewed as limited to the \r\n  facts presently before us.&quot;). \r\nThe trial judge thus erred in relying \r\n  on McElveen as support for his decision that the sale of the Pee Dee \r\n  Surgical Group was not relevant on the issue of valuation for purposes of the \r\n  marital litigation. In fact, we read McElveen to support our decision \r\n  that the sale of the Pee Dee group was clearly relevant for purposes of the \r\n  marital litigation. Evidence is relevant if it tends to make the existence of \r\n  any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable \r\n  or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Rule 401, SCRE. The \r\n  essence of Van Epps' malpractice claim against Law Firm relating to the evaluation \r\n  of Stewart's interest in the Pee Dee Surgical Group is that Law Firm's use of \r\n  Carroll Webster, rather than an independent witness who arguably would have \r\n  vigorously pursued the true value of the practice, resulted in the undervaluing \r\n  of Stewart's share in the practice. It is readily apparent that the agreement \r\n  to sell the practice to McLeod, which was entered into prior to the parties' \r\n  merits hearing and thereafter finalized, tends to make it more probable that \r\n  Van Epps' claim of malpractice was meritorious. It was thus error for the trial \r\n  judge to refuse to admit this evidence. \r\nWe likewise reject any contention \r\n  that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by the \r\n  danger of unfair prejudice to Law Firm. In assessing Van Epps' claim of malpractice \r\n  against Law Firm, the jury was clearly entitled to know that Stewart's interest, \r\n  which was valued at zero by Stewart and approximately $665 and $52,000 by Webster, \r\n  was ultimately purchased for $775,000, and that the agreement to purchase it \r\n  was signed by Stewart and his fellow shareholders prior to the merits hearing \r\n  in the parties' domestic action. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the issue \r\n  of malpractice as it relates to the business valuation for a new trial.\r\n  \r\nV. Conflict of Interest\r\nVan Epps argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in refusing to direct a verdict in her favor on the issue of legal malpractice \r\n  regarding a conflict of interest. We disagree.\r\nThis court must affirm the denial \r\n  of a directed verdict motion when there is any evidence to support the ruling \r\n  below. Pike, 332 S.C. at 610, 506 S.E.2d at 518. Van Epps contends a \r\n  conflict of interest existed due to Law Firm's representation of both Van Epps \r\n  and Bolick in their divorce actions. Professor John Freeman, appearing without \r\n  compensation, was qualified as an expert in lawyer's duties and legal malpractice, \r\n  based largely on his academic and other professional involvement in matters \r\n  of legal ethics. He stated, &quot;I believe there was an improper conflict of \r\n  interest, and I believe that Susan Van Epps suffered because that conflict of \r\n  interest was not dealt with properly.&quot; Professor Freeman further testified \r\n  that this conflict gave rise to Law Firm's failure to properly value Stewart's \r\n  interest and that, in his opinion, if there was an unethical conflict of interest, \r\n  no attorney's fees should be awarded. On the contrary, Jeffords testified that \r\n  although he disclosed his representation of Bolick to Van Epps, he did not consider \r\n  the representation to pose a conflict of interest and he therefore did not use \r\n  that term when speaking with Van Epps. Harry Wilson, an attorney qualified as \r\n  an expert on the standard of care of domestic attorneys, testified that he did \r\n  not believe Law Firm's representation of Bolick and Van Epps constituted a conflict \r\n  of interest.5 Accordingly, since there was conflicting evidence presented on \r\n  the issue of conflict of interest, the trial judge did not err in failing to \r\n  grant a directed verdict to Van Epps.6 \r\n  \r\n  VI. Attorney's Fees\r\n  \r\n  Van Epps claims the trial judge erred in refusing to direct a verdict in her \r\n  favor on the issue of attorney's fees. She asserts the trial judge should have \r\n  directed a verdict in her favor because Law Firm was not entitled to $52,120 \r\n  in uncollected attorney's fees in light of its legal malpractice and conflict \r\n  of interest. However, because we found the trial judge did not err in denying \r\n  Van Epps' directed verdict motions as to her claims for legal malpractice and \r\n  conflict of interest, we also find the trial judge did not err in denying her \r\n  motion for directed verdict on the issue of attorney's fees.7 See Pike, \r\n  332 S.C. at 610, 506 S.E.2d at 518 (requiring the appellate court to affirm \r\n  the denial of a directed verdict motion when there is any evidence to support \r\n  the ruling below). However, because the issue of attorney's fees is inextricably \r\n  linked to Van Epps' conflict of interest claim, the issue of attorney's fees \r\n  is also remanded to be determined de novo at the new trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial judge is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN \r\n  PART, and REMANDED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n The trial judge refused to permit \r\n  Van Epps' counsel to cross-examine Jeffords as to why he failed to call any \r\n  of the people who filed affidavits as witnesses at the final hearing. \r\n2 The salary continuation document, \r\n  by its own terms, applied only in the event of the retirement, death, or disability \r\n  of a shareholder. \r\n3 Allen v. United States, \r\n  164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154 (1896).\r\n4 Although we affirm the denial of \r\n  the directed verdict based on the record before us, our decision in no way affects \r\n  Van Epps' ability to move for a directed verdict on this issue at her new trial.\r\n5 We need not decide whether an attorney \r\n  licensed to practice law in this state is necessarily competent to testify as \r\n  an expert in the field of legal ethics because Van Epps, although initially \r\n  objecting to Wilson's qualification in this field, has not raised the issue \r\n  of Wilson's qualifications on appeal. \r\n6 Because the conflict of interest \r\n  issue was a part of Van Epps' overall claim for legal malpractice, our disposition \r\n  of this issue does not preclude Van Epps from re-trying the conflict of interest \r\n  issue at her new trial. Furthermore, because our decision to affirm the denial \r\n  of Van Epps' directed verdict motion is based on the record before us, our decision \r\n  does not impact Van Epps' ability to move for a directed verdict on this issue \r\n  at her new trial.\r\n7 We again note that our decision \r\n  to affirm the denial of Van Epps' motion for directed verdict as to attorney's \r\n  fees is based exclusively on the record before us. On remand, Van Epps may again \r\n  move for a directed verdict on this issue, and the trial judge shall rule on \r\n  her motion based upon the evidence presented at the new trial. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3756","title":"Matthews v.

Henry McKellar, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3756\r\nSubmitted February 9, 2004 â€“ Filed March \r\n  8, 2004\r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nW. Michael Duncan, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Lewis Cromer, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Richland County School District \r\n  One appeals the trial courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Delores Matthews following \r\n  a jury verdict on her claim under the Payment of Wages Act.Â  We dismiss the \r\n  appeal as being untimely. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 31, 2002, Matthews commenced \r\n  this action by filing a complaint alleging a cause of action under the South \r\n  Carolina Payment of Wages Act. [1] \r\n  Â  Matthews worked as a bookkeeper for School District when the events underlying \r\n  the current litigation occurred. \r\nMatthews averred she performed work for \r\n  School District during the summer months of 1999, for which she received no \r\n  compensation.Â  Specifically, Matthews sought remuneration of standard pay for \r\n  157.5 hours, overtime pay for 217.5 hours, and travel expenses of $1,053.Â  The \r\n  total amount sought in the complaint amounted to approximately $8,000. \r\nFollowing a jury trial on December 19, 2001, \r\n  a verdict was returned for Matthews in the amount of $10,000 actual damages.Â  \r\n  After the jury was dismissed, School District made a motion for judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict (â€œJNOVâ€) on the ground there was no evidence in the record to support \r\n  the amount awarded.Â  School District also made a motion for remittitur, specifically \r\n  asking the court to reduce the amount awarded to an amount supported by the \r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nThe trial court denied both of School \r\n  Districtâ€™s motions and upheld the verdict of $10,000.Â  School District received \r\n  a written copy of the entry of judgment on January 14, 2002, and moved pursuant \r\n  to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment on January 25, 2002.Â  This \r\n  motion restated the argument made in School Districtâ€™s JNOV motion that there \r\n  was no evidence to support the award of $10,000.Â  Matthews submitted a response \r\n  to School Districtâ€™s motion on January 31, 2002, in which she asked the court \r\n  to let the verdict stand, or, in the alternative, order a new trial nisi \r\n  and allow her to recover attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Included with this response, Matthews \r\n  filed three affidavits, each attesting to the fact that $8,000 in attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees was reasonable and appropriate.\r\nAt the hearing held on March 7, 2002, the \r\n  trial court began by questioning his authority to reconsider his denial of the \r\n  post-trial motion.Â  Counsel for both parties assured the court it had jurisdiction, \r\n  and the trial court ultimately granted School Districtâ€™s motion.Â  In its order \r\n  dated March 19, 2002, the trial court found the evidence supported a verdict \r\n  in the amount of $7,100.Â  However, the trial court also awarded Matthews attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees in the amount of $4,900.Â  Thus, the total awarded to Matthews following \r\n  the hearing was $12,000, rather than the original $10,000 awarded by the jury.Â  \r\n  School District filed its notice of appeal on April 19, 2002.\r\nSchool Districtâ€™s argument on appeal is that \r\n  the trial court erred in making a mandatory award of attorneyâ€™s fees in its \r\n  March 19th order when School District disputed Matthewsâ€™ claims for \r\n  wages and expenses in good faith.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe conclude the trial court lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to entertain School Districtâ€™s identical, successive post-trial motion and, \r\n  as a result, the appeal to this court is untimely, thereby depriving us of jurisdiction. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nRule 203(b)(1), SCACR, provides that the notice of \r\n  appeal from a civil action shall be served on respondents within thirty days \r\n  after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Although \r\n  timely motions for JNOV, to alter or amend the judgment, or for a new trial \r\n  stay the time for appeal until such time as written notice of entry of the order \r\n  granting or denying the motions is received, they do not extend the time for \r\n  appeal when, as in the current situation, the subsequent motions are merely \r\n  restatements of previous motions.\r\nRecently, in Collins Music Co. v. \r\n  IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied,Â  \r\n  123 S. Ct. 303 (2003), this court considered this very issue.Â  In Collins, \r\n  after a jury verdict was awarded against it, IGT made timely motions for JNOV, \r\n  new trial, and new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Id. at 560, \r\n  579 S.E.2d at 524.Â  All of these motions were denied by the trial judge and \r\n  IGT was served with a copy of the order on September 5, 2001.Â  Id.  \r\nIGT served a motion to alter or amend \r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, on September 12, 2001, which merely restated \r\n  the arguments made in the post-trial motions.Â  Id. at 561, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  at 524.Â  IGT received written notice of the entry of the order denying its motion \r\n  to alter or amend on November 5, 2001, and thereafter served its notice of appeal \r\n  on November 21, 2001.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nRelying on Coward Hund Constr. \r\n  Co. v. Ball Corp., 336 S.C. 1, 518 S.E.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding that \r\n  successive post-trial motions do not toll the time for appeal) and Quality \r\n  Trailer Products, Inc. v. CSL Equip. Co., 349 S.C. 216, 562 S.E.2d 615 (2002) \r\n  (holding that successive new trial or JNOV motions do not toll the time for \r\n  serving the notice of appeal), we held that because IGTâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion \r\n  did not raise any new issues, but rather repeated the arguments made in its \r\n  earlier motions, it was not a proper Rule 59(e) motion and thus, did not toll \r\n  the time for serving the notice of appeal.Â  Collins, 353 S.C. at 566, \r\n  579 S.E.2d at 527.Â  Therefore, because the issues raised in the subsequent motions \r\n  were preserved for review after the courtâ€™s first post-trial order, the time \r\n  to appeal lapsed while IGT was seeking a ruling on its subsequent Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe facts of the current case are similar \r\n  to those in Collins, Coward Hund, and Quality Trailer.Â  \r\n  School District made a motion for JNOV immediately following the juryâ€™s verdict \r\n  on the grounds that the evidence did not support the amount awarded by the jury.Â  \r\n  The trial court denied this motion.Â  School District received a written copy \r\n  of entry of the judgment on January 14, 2002, and moved pursuant to Rule 59(e) \r\n  to alter or amend the judgment on exactly the same grounds â€“ that the evidence \r\n  did not support the verdict.Â  The trial court issued an order on March 19, 2002, \r\n  granting School Districtâ€™s motion and awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  School District \r\n  filed its notice of appeal on April 19, 2002. Â \r\nWe find that School Districtâ€™s time for appeal began \r\n  to run when it received the written notice of judgment on January 14, 2002.Â  \r\n  Because School Districtâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion was nothing but a restatement of \r\n  the arguments it made in its post-trial motion, the Rule 59(e) motion did not \r\n  stay the time to file the notice to appeal.Â  While we recognize that the trial \r\n  court granted School Districtâ€™s second motion, making this case slightly different \r\n  from prior South Carolina cases on this issue, we conclude the trial court lacked \r\n  jurisdiction to consider School Districtâ€™s identical post-trial motion. Cf. \r\n  Leviner v. Sonoco Products, Co., 359 S.C. 492, 493-494, 530 S.E.2d 127, \r\n  127-128 (2000) (finding that a full written order issued by the circuit court \r\n  after the court had already issued a form order remanding the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  case was a nullity because neither party had made a timely motion to alter or \r\n  amend the judgment and the circuit court did not file a timely sua sponte order \r\n  altering or amending the judgment).Â  As explained in Collins, successive \r\n  post-trial motions are not appropriate unless the initial post-trial order alters \r\n  the judgment.Â  Here, the trial court declined to alter the juryâ€™s verdict in \r\n  any way after School Districtâ€™s initial post-trial motions. Thus, the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s jurisdiction ended and School Districtâ€™s time to appeal the verdict \r\n  began to run upon receipt of the trial courtâ€™s order denying School Districtâ€™s \r\n  post-trial motions.Â  The alternative of allowing trial courts to consider successive \r\n  post-trial motions would result in a partyâ€™s ability to appeal being governed \r\n  by whether its successive post-trial motion was granted or denied. \r\n  [3]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, \r\n  because School Districtâ€™s time for appeal began to run on January 14, 2002, \r\n  and School District did not file its notice of appeal until April 19, 2002, \r\n  its appeal is untimely.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order dated March 19, 2002, is vacated \r\n  for lack of jurisdiction, and the juryâ€™s original verdict is reinstated.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED. \r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C.

Â§Â§ 41-10-10 â€“ 110 (Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Although neither party raised this argument on appeal, this court is obligated \r\n    to evaluate subject matter jurisdiction on its own motion.Â  Ness v. Eckerd \r\n    Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 402, 566 S.E.2d 193, 195 (Ct.

We vacate in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\nThe property at issue in this case \r\n  is located in Georgetown County, in an area known as the Waccamaw Neck region. \r\n  Â In 1745, Percival Pawley and his wife conveyed the property \r\n  [1]  to two trustees, George Pawley and William Poole, â€œin Trust For The \r\n  Inhabitants On Waccamaw Neck for the Use of a Chapple or Church for divine worship \r\n  of the Church of England established by Law.â€Â  \r\nIn 1767, the General Assembly passed \r\n  an act creating the Parish in the â€œWaccamaw Neckâ€ region and appointing seven \r\n  men to serve as commissioners for the Parish. [2] Â  See Act No. 961 of May \r\n  23, 1767, 4 Stat. 266.Â  Later that year, one of the commissioners recorded the \r\n  1745 trust deed in Charleston County. \r\nAlthough \r\n  the charter was renewed on several occasions, [3]  in 1902 the Parish became concerned \r\n  that its charter had â€œprobably long since expired,â€ vesting its property with \r\n  the Diocese. [4]  Â To remedy this situation, \r\n  the Chancellor of the Diocese suggested the Parish apply to the South Carolina \r\n  Secretary of State for a corporate charter and request a quitclaim deed from \r\n  the Diocese. Â Later that same year, the Parish received its certificate \r\n  of incorporation from the Secretary of State. Â In 1903, the trustees \r\n  of the Diocese executed a deed that relinquished title of the property to the \r\n  Parish.Â  \r\nSubsequent \r\n  to the recording of this deed, the Parish leased parts of the property for uses \r\n  not authorized by the trust and mortgaged the property. \r\n  [5] Â  \r\nIn September \r\n  2000, after an ecclesiastical dispute arose involving the Parish, the Diocese, \r\n  and the National Church, the Bishop of the Diocese issued a notice setting forth \r\n  the canons of the Diocese and the National Church that limit the alienation \r\n  and encumbrance of church property.Â  This notice was recorded in the public \r\n  records of Georgetown County.Â  \r\nIn response \r\n  to the recording of this notice, the Parish filed a complaint in October 2000, \r\n  seeking a removal of the notice from the deed book and a declaration that it \r\n  owned the real and personal property located on Pawleyâ€™s Island.Â  The Diocese \r\n  and the National Church answered and counterclaimed, alleging the property was \r\n  owned by the Parish subject to the canons of the Diocese and the National Church. \r\n  \r\nThe Parish \r\n  requested the court appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests \r\n  of John and Jane Doe, the representatives of the descendants to the original \r\n  trustees of the 1745 trust. \r\nAfter \r\n  the circuit court appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the Does, \r\n  the Does petitioned for partial summary judgment on the issue of the ownership \r\n  of the real property, arguing they were the sole owners of the real property.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, the Parish aligned itself with the Doesâ€™ position. [6] \r\nAt the \r\n  hearing, the Diocese and the National Church defended against the Doesâ€™ claim, \r\n  [7]  maintaining the position that the Parish owned the real property and \r\n  they owned an interest in any property owned by the Parish. \r\nAfter hearing extensive argument \r\n  on the Doesâ€™ motion for summary judgment, the circuit court concluded the language \r\n  contained in the 1745 trust deed was clear and unambiguous and therefore refused \r\n  to consider parol evidence to explain the terms in the trust deed. Â The \r\n  circuit court granted the Doesâ€™ motion for partial summary judgment, ruling \r\n  â€œthe 1745 Deed created an active valid and binding charitable trust and legal \r\n  title to the Subject Property is held by the common law heirs of George Pawley \r\n  represented by John Doe and Jane Doe, and the equitable title is held by the \r\n  inhabitants of the Waccamaw Neck as the Trust beneficiaries.â€ Â In making \r\n  its ruling, the circuit court determined: 1) the Diocese and the National Church \r\n  did not have standing to assert Statute of Uses, adverse possession, laches, \r\n  and staleness; 2) the Statute of Uses did not execute the trust; 3) the trust \r\n  did not fail when the Church of England ceased to be recognized in the United \r\n  States; 4) the Parish did not acquire the property by adverse possession; 5) \r\n  the Doesâ€™ claim was not barred by laches; 6) the Doesâ€™ claim was not barred \r\n  by staleness; 7) the Diocese and the National Church were â€œat best, incidental \r\n  beneficiariesâ€ to the trust; and 8) the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to determine the ownership of the personal property.

Shoals Sewer, 308 S.C. 422, 428, 418 S.E.2d 546, 549 \r\n  (1992) (holding a party has standing to sue if the party has â€œa real, material, \r\n  or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to . \r\n  . . only a nominal or technical interest in the actionâ€); Duke Power v. South \r\n  Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 284 S.C. 81, 96, 326 S.E.2d 395, 404 (1985) \r\n  (â€œ[T]o have standing to present a case before the courts of this State, a party \r\n  must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit.â€); see \r\n  Town of Sullivanâ€™s Island v. Felger, 318 S.C. 340, 346, 457 S.E.2d 626, \r\n  629 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding the town has standing in a declaratory action to \r\n  determine whether Felger owns fee simple title to the property, even though \r\n  the town does not have a direct interest in ownership of the property).\r\nThe present lawsuit \r\n  began as an action with the Parish as plaintiff and the Diocese and the National \r\n  Church as co-defendants. Â The Parish initiated the lawsuit after the \r\n  Bishop of the Diocese filed a notice in the County of Georgetown Deed Book, \r\n  claiming the Diocese and National Church hold an interest in any property owned \r\n  by the Parish based on the canons of the Diocese and the National Church. [8]  Â In its complaint, the \r\n  Parish requested the circuit court declare it to be the sole owner of the property. \r\n  \r\nBecause the Parish \r\n  requested it be declared the sole owner of the property and did not simply ask \r\n  the circuit court to determine the claims between the Parish, the Diocese, and \r\n  the National Church, the circuit court heard arguments for the appointment of \r\n  representatives for anyone having an interest in the property.Â  The circuit \r\n  court appointed the Does to represent the claim of the descendants of the trustees \r\n  to the 1745 trust.Â  \r\nAfter being appointed, \r\n  the Does moved for partial summary judgment, claiming they alone held legal \r\n  title to the real property. Â The Parish supported this motion.Â  Unless \r\n  the Diocese and the National Church are able to assert the Parish owns the real \r\n  property, their claim to an interest in the property will be lost based solely \r\n  on the Parishâ€™s decision not to pursue the issue.Â  Thus, the Diocese and National \r\n  Church have a stake in any lawsuit that could affect the Parishâ€™s interest in \r\n  the property.\r\nTherefore, the \r\n  circuit court erred by ruling the Diocese and the National Church did not have \r\n  standing to assert Statute of Uses, adverse possession, laches, and staleness.Â  \r\n  Consequently, we reverse.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Summary Judgment\r\nStandard \r\n  of Review\r\nSummary judgment \r\n  is appropriate where â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \r\n  and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining \r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.â€ Strother v.

Statute of Uses \r\nThe Diocese \r\n  and the National Church argue the circuit court erred by ruling on summary judgment \r\n  that the Statute of Uses did not execute the trust.Â  We agree.\r\nIn a \r\n  trust where the trustee is instructed to use the property for the benefit of \r\n  another, the Statute of Uses executes to vest legal title with the beneficiary, \r\n  if the beneficiary is capable of taking legal title and the trustee has no active \r\n  duties. Restatement (Second) of Trusts Â§ 67 (1959); see id. at \r\n  cmt. b (â€œWhen the Statute of Uses executes a use or trust not only is the interest \r\n  of the beneficiary made legal but the interest of the person who otherwise would \r\n  hold subject to the use or trust is extinguished. The Statute thus has a double \r\n  effect in turning the equitable interest of one person into a legal interest \r\n  and extinguishing the legal interest of the other.â€); Johnson v. Thornton, \r\n  264 S.C. 252, 257, 214 S.E.2d 124, 127 (1975) (â€œIn a passive trust the legal \r\n  and equitable titles are merged in the beneficiaries and the beneficial use \r\n  is converted into legal ownership, but as to an active trust the title remains \r\n  in the trustee for the purpose of the trust.â€); see also Young v. \r\n  McNeill, 78 S.C. 143, 153, 59 S.E. 986, 989 (1907) (holding the Statute \r\n  of Uses will not execute the trust if the beneficiary of the trust is not capable \r\n  of taking legal title); Bowen v. Humphreys, 24 S.C. 452, 455 (1886) (holding \r\n  the Statute of Uses will not execute the trust â€œas long as there is anything \r\n  remaining for the trustee to do which renders it necessary that he should retain \r\n  the legal title in order fully to perform the duties imposed upon him by the \r\n  trustâ€).Â  \r\nThe Does argued \r\n  the Statute of Uses did not execute the trust.Â  According to the Does, the plain \r\n  language of the trust deed established the beneficiary was not capable of taking \r\n  legal title, and the trustee had active duties. \r\nThe circuit court \r\n  agreed with the Does, ruling the term â€œinhabitants on Waccamaw Neckâ€ referred \r\n  to the people living in the geographic region and ruling the language in the \r\n  deed imposed an affirmative duty upon the trustees to assure â€œcontinued use \r\n  of the property for a chapel or church and to ensure that divine worship [was] \r\n  maintained.â€ [9]  \r\nBecause of these \r\n  rulings, the circuit court refused to consider parol evidence regarding the \r\n  issues of whether the beneficiary was capable of taking legal title and whether \r\n  the trustee lacked affirmative duties. \r\nâ€œThe \r\n  primary consideration in construing a trust is to discern the settlorâ€™s intent.â€ \r\n  Bowles v. Bradley, 319 S.C. 377, 380, 461 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1995).Â  When \r\n  the beneficiary â€œis described in terms applicable . . . to more than one person \r\n  or thing, [parol] evidence is admissible to prove which of the persons or things \r\n  so described was intended.â€ [10]  Cuningham v. Cuningham, 20 S.C. 317, \r\n  330 (1883) (quoting James Wigram &amp; John Oâ€™Hara, A Treatise on Extrinsic \r\n  Evidence in Aid of the Interpretation of Wills 142 (1872)); see Bowles, \r\n  319 S.C. at 380, 461 S.E.2d at 813 (â€œ[W]hen there is no defect on the face of \r\n  a document but an uncertainty appears upon attempting to effectuate the document, \r\n  then the document contains a latent ambiguity and parol evidence is admissible \r\n  to determine the settlorâ€™s intent.â€).Â  Furthermore, the evidence must be considered \r\n  in light of the law as it existed at the time. See id. (holding \r\n  it was proper to review the case law applicable to the time when the settlor \r\n  wrote his trust deed to determine â€œissueâ€ had only one legal interpretation \r\n  at the time, meaning no latent ambiguity existed).\r\nIn adopting the \r\n  Doesâ€™ argument, the circuit court ignored the argument of the Diocese and the \r\n  National Church that â€œInhabitants on Waccamaw Neckâ€ referred to the Parish.Â  \r\n  According to the Diocese and the National Church, the settlor intended to deed \r\n  the property to the Parish but could not do so directly until such time as the \r\n  church was officially recognized by the government.Â  Based on this argument, \r\n  the Statute of Uses executed the trust once the Parish was officially established, \r\n  meaning the trustees had no continuing duties. [11] Â  \r\nTo advance \r\n  their point, the Diocese and the National Church offered parol evidence, statutes, \r\n  cases, and constitutions to demonstrate that in colonial times churches could \r\n  not be recognized by the government until they owned property, and they could \r\n  not own property until they had been officially recognized.Â  See Pawlet, \r\n  13 U.S. at 330 (holding â€œno parish church . . . could have a legal existence \r\n  until consecration and consecration was expressly inhibited unless upon a suitable \r\n  endowment of landâ€).Â  As such, a colonial practice arose in which a settlor \r\n  placed property in trust for a congregation until such time as the government \r\n  recognized the church. See id. at 331 (â€œ[I]t would form an exception \r\n  to the generality of the rule, that to make a grant valid there must be a person \r\n  in esse capable of taking it.Â  And under such circumstances until a parson \r\n  should be legally inducted to such new church, the fee of its lands would remain \r\n  in abeyance.â€).Â  The Diocese and the National Church argued this practice was \r\n  followed by the settlor as evidenced by the fact that the trust was not recorded \r\n  until the year the Parish was recognized by the government, approximately twenty \r\n  years after the trust was created.\r\nBecause uncertainty \r\n  arose when attempting to effectuate the trust deed, we hold â€œinhabitants on \r\n  Waccamaw Neckâ€ was a latent ambiguity, and it was error for the circuit court \r\n  to refuse to consider parol evidence, statutes, cases, and constitutions in \r\n  determining whether the beneficiary was capable of taking legal title and whether \r\n  the trustees lacked affirmative duties. \r\n  [12]  See Bowles, 319 S.C. at 380, 461 S.E.2d at 813 (â€œ[W]hen \r\n  there is no defect on the face of a document but an uncertainty appears upon \r\n  attempting to effectuate the document, then the document contains a latent ambiguity \r\n  and parol evidence is admissible to determine the settlorâ€™s intent.â€).\r\nWhen the parol \r\n  evidence is considered, there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as \r\n  to the meaning of â€œinhabitants on Waccamaw Neck.â€Â  Therefore, the circuit court \r\n  erred by ruling on summary judgment that the Statute of Uses did not execute \r\n  the trust. See George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  868, 874 (2001) (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition \r\n  of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Failure \r\n  of the Trust [13] \r\n\r\nThe Diocese and the National Church \r\n  argue the circuit court erred by ruling on summary judgment that the trust did \r\n  not fail when the Church of England ceased to be recognized in the United States. \r\n  [14] Â  We agree.\r\n\r\nâ€œCharitable trusts are entitled to \r\n  peculiar favor; the courts will construe them to give them effect, if possible, \r\n  and to carry out the general intention of the donor.â€ Colin McK.

Id. at 330-36, 195 S.E.2d \r\n  at 836-39.Â  In determining whether the trust failed, our supreme court stated \r\n  that because â€œa change in conditions which the Testator could not have reasonably \r\n  anticipatedâ€ occurred, the application of the trust language to the â€œfactual \r\n  situation [as it existed in 1971] result[ed] in certain latent ambiguities and \r\n  uncertainties.â€ Id. at 336, 332, 195 S.E.2d at 839, 838.Â  Thus, our supreme \r\n  court concluded it was proper to admit parol evidence to determine if the intent \r\n  of the testator could be carried out with a deviation from the literal words \r\n  of the trust or if the change of circumstances meant that the purpose of the \r\n  trust had been frustrated. Id. at 331-342, 195 S.E.2d at 837-43. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the present case, the \r\n  trust required the property be used to house a chapel for worship of the â€œChurch \r\n  of England established by Law.â€ Â When the settlor wrote this term in \r\n  1745, there was no ambiguity as to the meaning of the term.Â  The term referred \r\n  to the state church of England which was recognized by the ruling authorities \r\n  of the American colonies.Â  However, after the formation of the United States, \r\n  both the national constitution and state constitution disallowed the establishment \r\n  of a state-sponsored church.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. I (â€œCongress shall \r\n  make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \r\n  exercise thereof.â€); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 2 (â€œThe General Assembly shall make \r\n  no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise \r\n  thereof.â€). \r\nThus, a latent ambiguity arose \r\nonce the Church of England ceased to be recognized in the United States.Â  Therefore, \r\nthe circuit court erred by refusing to consider parol evidence concerning the \r\nlegal successor of the Church of England in the United States.Â  See Bonds, \r\n260 S.C. at 332, 195 S.E.2d at 838 (holding â€œthe application of [the trust] language \r\nto the current factual situation result[ed] in certain latent ambiguities and \r\nuncertaintiesâ€); cf. Pawlet, 13 U.S. at 323-36 (holding the court \r\nshould consider common law, statutes, and historical material in determining whether \r\na charter grant of â€œone share for a glebe \r\n[15]  for the church of England as by law establishedâ€ was either void or \r\ndevolved to the state after the American Revolution).Â  \r\nWhen \r\n  the parol evidence is considered, there is at least a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact as to whether the trust failed when the â€œChurch of England established \r\n  by lawâ€ ceased to exist in the United States.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred \r\n  by granting summary judgment to the Does on this issue. See George, \r\n  345 S.C. at 452, 548 S.E.2d at 874 (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\nC. Â Â Â Â  Adverse Possession\r\ni.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Evidence of Adverse Possession\r\nThe Diocese and \r\n  the National Church argue the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment \r\n  to the Does on the claim of adverse possession because ample evidence was presented \r\n  that the Parish had adversely possessed the property in excess of forty years.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nâ€œTo constitute \r\n  adverse possession, the possession must be continuous, hostile, open, actual, \r\n  notorious and exclusive for . . .

Monteith, 286 S.C. 176, 180, 345 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1986). \r\nWhere \r\n  the party claims the property under color of title, the statutory period is \r\n  forty years. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-380 (1977) (â€œNo action shall be commenced \r\n  in any case for the recovery of real property or for any interest therein against \r\n  a person in possession under claim of title by virtue of a written instrument \r\n  unless the person claiming, his ancestor or grantor, was actually in the possession \r\n  of the same or a part thereof within forty years from the commencement of such \r\n  action.Â  And the possession of a defendant, sole or connected, pursuant to the \r\n  provisions of this section shall be deemed valid against the world after the \r\n  lapse of such a period.â€); see Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 260 (7th \r\n  ed. 1999) (stating color of title is â€œa written instrument or other evidence \r\n  that appears to give title, but does not do soâ€).\r\nIn 1903, the Diocese \r\n  presented the Parish with a quitclaim deed to the property. Â At least \r\n  from 1903 to the filing of the lawsuit in 2000, the Parish continually possessed \r\n  the property at issue in this case. \r\n  [16]  Â During this period, the Parish built structures on the property, \r\n  improved the property, and sold burial plots from the property.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the Parish mortgaged the property on four separate occasions from 1959 to 1993.Â  \r\n  On each occasion, the Parish represented to the lender that it held fee simple \r\n  title to the property. [17] Â  \r\n  See Miller v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56, 62, 413 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1992) \r\n  (holding evidence of adverse possession included mortgage payments paid on the \r\n  property, taxes paid on the property, and boundary lines marked on the disputed \r\n  property); see also First Baptist Church of Woodruff v. Turner, \r\n  248 S.C. 71, 81, 149 S.E.2d 45, 49 (1966) (â€œâ€˜The giving of a deed or mortgage \r\n  by one in possession of land is ordinarily evidence of assertion of title.â€™â€ \r\n  (quoting Carr v. Mouzon, 86 S.C. 461, 467, 68 S.E. 661, 663 (1910))).\r\nThus, the Diocese \r\n  and the National Church presented ample evidence that the possession by the \r\n  Parish was continuous, hostile, open, actual, notorious, and exclusive from \r\n  at least 1903 to 2000, a period of nearly 100 years. See Presbyterian \r\n  Church of James Island v. Pendarvis, 227 S.C. 50, 57, 86 S.E.2d 740, 743 \r\n  (1955) (holding evidence of adverse possession included the churchâ€™s dealings \r\n  with the property as if it owned the property in fee simple for a period of \r\n  more than half a century, and the fact that the churchâ€™s title had not been \r\n  questioned for approximately fifty years).Â  Viewing the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to the Diocese and the National Church, there is at least a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact as to whether the Parish had adversely possessed the \r\n  property for at least forty years.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred by granting \r\n  summary judgment in favor of the Does on this issue. See George, \r\n  345 S.C. at 452, 548 S.E.2d at 874 (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\nii.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Requirement of Hostile Possession\r\nThe Diocese and \r\n  the National Church argue the circuit court erred by ruling on summary judgment \r\n  that the Parish was not in hostile possession of the property.Â  We agree.\r\nHostile possession \r\n  is â€œpossession asserted against the claims of all others.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n  1184 (7th ed. 1999).Â  \r\nAn adverse possession \r\n  claim fails if the claimantâ€™s possession is not hostile.

Eller, 298 S.C. 395, 397, 380 S.E.2d \r\n  853, 854 (Ct. App. 1989), for the proposition that possession cannot be hostile \r\n  if based on a mistaken belief of ownership.Â  \r\nOur supreme court \r\n  stated the rule that â€œpossession under a mistaken belief that property is oneâ€™s \r\n  own and with no intent to claim against the propertyâ€™s true owner cannot constitute \r\n  hostileÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  possession . . . is applicable only to cases involving boundary \r\n  disputes between adjoining landowners.â€Â  Perry, 316 S.C. at 226, 449 \r\n  S.E.2d at 251; see Pendarvis, 227 S.C. at 57-58, 86 S.E.2d at \r\n  743 (holding a partyâ€™s possession was adverse even when â€œdue to the long lapse \r\n  of time all parties, including the congregation and the ministers, had simply \r\n  forgotten the trustâ€).\r\nBecause the dispute \r\n  in this case concerns the entire piece of property and is not merely a boundary \r\n  dispute, the circuit court erred by applying Cook. [18] \r\nAs an additional \r\n  ground for finding the Parishâ€™s possession was not hostile, the circuit court \r\n  cited Frady v. Invester, 118 S.C. 195, 205, 110 S.E. 135, 138 (1921), \r\n  for the proposition that one who enters property based on permissive use may \r\n  not fulfill the hostility requirement of adverse possession. \r\n  [19] Â  \r\nAlthough our supreme \r\n  court noted a party cannot adversely possess property used with the permission \r\n  of the owner, it stated a party may adversely possess such property upon a clear \r\n  disclaimer of the ownerâ€™s title.Â  Monteith, 289 S.C. at 180, 345 S.E.2d \r\n  at 726; see Young v. Nix, 286 S.C. 134, 136, 332 S.E.2d 773, 774 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œWhere one enters land under permission from the title holder, \r\n  the possession can never ripen into an adverse title unless a clear and positive \r\n  disclaimer of the title under which entry was made is brought home to the other \r\n  party.â€).\r\nThe actions of \r\n  the Parish from at least 1903 to 2000, including leasing the property for uses \r\n  not permitted by the trust and mortgaging the property, could not have been \r\n  based on the permission of the trustees because no additional trustees were \r\n  appointed after the death of the last trustee in 1774. Â Further, none \r\n  of the four mortgages taken out by the Parish made reference to any ownership \r\n  interest related to the 1745 trust. \r\n  [20] Â  Thus, the circuit court erred in applying Frady to these facts.\r\nViewing the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to the Diocese and the National Church, there is \r\n  at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Parish fulfilled \r\n  the hostility requirement for adverse possession.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred \r\n  by granting summary judgment to the Does on this issue. See George, \r\n  345 S.C. at 452, 548 S.E.2d at 874 (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\niii. \r\n  Â Â Â Â  Repudiation of the Trust by a Beneficiary or a Trustee [21]  \r\nThe Diocese and \r\n  the National Church argue the circuit court erred by ruling on summary judgment \r\n  that the Parish had not repudiated the trust.Â  We agree. \r\nIn a claim for \r\n  adverse possession â€œwhere oneâ€™s possession was begun in privity with or in subservience \r\n  to the title of another,â€ adverse possession cannot begin until the trust is \r\n  openly repudiated by â€œa clear, positive, and continued disclaimer of the title \r\n  . . . [and the adverse claim is] brought home to the other party.â€ Bradley \r\n  v. Calhoun, 125 S.C. 70, 82, 117 S.E. 811, 815 (1923); cf. Ham \r\n  v. Flowers, 214 S.C. 212, 218-19, 51 S.E.2d 753, 756 (1949) (holding when \r\n  a party took possession of property to protect his interest as a mortgagee, \r\n  that party entered â€œthe premises in the quasi character of trustee for the mortgagor \r\n  and [could] not hold adversely to [mortgagorâ€™s] rights until he distinctly disavows \r\n  and repudiates his mortgagee relationship and notice thereof is brought home \r\n  to the mortgagorâ€).Â  \r\nRepudiation â€œneed \r\n  not be in specific words but may consist of conduct inconsistent with the existence \r\n  of the trust.â€ Pendarvis, 227 S.C. at 57-58, 86 S.E.2d at 743-44 (holding \r\n  the partyâ€™s leasing the property and using the property in a manner not consistent \r\n  with the trust was â€œtantamount to a repudiation of the trustâ€).\r\nAlthough the factual \r\n  situations in Calhoun, Ham, and Pendarvis involved trustees \r\n  adversely possessing against the trust, â€œ[t]he same requirements logically apply \r\n  to the possession by a beneficiary.â€ See Reasor v. Peoples Fin. Servs., \r\n  579 S.E.2d 742, 744 (Ga. 2003) (holding a trustee or a beneficiary may adversely \r\n  possess against the trust by denying the trust and possessing in a continuous, \r\n  hostile, open, actual, notorious, and exclusive manner); see also Lewis \r\n  v. Hawkins, 90 U.S. 119, 126 (1874) (holding a beneficiary can adversely \r\n  possess against the trust if a distinct denial of the trust or a possession \r\n  inconsistent with it is clearly shown).\r\nIn 1947, the Parish \r\n  leased portions of the property for uses not authorized by the trust. Â This \r\n  act constituted evidence of repudiation. See Pendarvis, 227 S.C. \r\n  at 57-58, 86 S.E.2d at 743-44.Â  \r\nFrom 1959 to 1993, \r\n  the Parish mortgaged the property at least four times, each time listing itself \r\n  as the owner of the property. [22]  Â Because neither the language of the \r\n  trust nor an order of the probate court authorized such action, mortgaging the \r\n  property was additional evidence of repudiation. See 27 S.C. Jur. Mortgages \r\n  Â§ 12(i) (1996) (â€œA trustee may not mortgage trust property unless the trust \r\n  agreement specifically authorizes such action without court approval.â€); see \r\n  also Chapman v. Williams, 112 S.C. 402, 405-06, 100 S.E. 360, 361 \r\n  (1919) (â€œThis court does not say that under no circumstances will it allow trustees \r\n  to put a mortgage on trust property, but three things must appear: (a) the necessity \r\n  for the mortgage must be absolute; (b) the trustees must consent to the mortgage; \r\n  and (c) the trustees must have the power to make the mortgage.â€).Â  \r\nViewing \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the Diocese and the National Church, \r\n  there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Parish \r\n  repudiated the trust.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment \r\n  to the Does on this issue. See George, 345 S.C. at 452, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  at 874 (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases \r\n  which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Laches\r\nThe Diocese \r\n  and the National Church argue the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment \r\n  to the Does on the claim of laches.Â  We agree.\r\nLaches \r\n  is an equitable doctrine, which â€œarises upon the failure to assert a known right.â€ \r\n  Ex parte Stokes, 256 S.C. 260, 267, 182 S.E.2d 306, 309 (1971); see \r\n  Byars v. Cherokee County, 237 S.C. 548, 559, 118 S.E.2d 324, 330 (1961) \r\n  (â€œLaches is the neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, \r\n  under circumstances permitting diligence, to do what in law should have been \r\n  done, or neglecting or omitting to do what in law should have been done for \r\n  an unreasonable and unexplained length of time and in circumstances which afforded \r\n  opportunity for diligence.â€).\r\nTo prove \r\n  laches, a party must establish: â€œ(1) delay, (2) unreasonable delay, [and] (3) \r\n  prejudice.â€ Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 528 \r\n  (1988); see Arceneaux v. Arrington, 284 S.C. 500, 503, 327 S.E.2d \r\n  357, 358 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œWhetherÂ  . . . [a claim] is barred by laches is to \r\n  be determined in light of the facts of each case, taking into consideration \r\n  whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other \r\n  party.â€).\r\nIn addition, \r\n  â€œthe circumstances must . . . [be] such as to import that the complainant had \r\n  abandoned or surrendered the claim or right which he now asserts.â€ Byars, \r\n  237 S.C. at 559, 118 S.E.2d at 330; see Pendarvis, 227 S.C. at \r\n  58, 86 S.E.2d at 744 (holding a party seeking to enforce a trust â€œmay become \r\n  barred by laches if he fails to proceed with reasonable diligenceâ€).\r\n\r\nAssuming the trust still exists, \r\n  no assertion of rights has been made on behalf of the trust in approximately \r\n  200 years.Â  During this 200-year period, the Parish leased the property for \r\n  uses not mentioned in the trust and mortgaged it on at least four different \r\n  occasions. [23] Â \r\nIn the mortgages \r\ndated 1979, 1988, and 1993, the Parish covenanted it was â€œlawfully seisedâ€ of \r\nthe property it was mortgaging. Â According to Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, \r\nâ€œseiseâ€ means to hold in fee simple.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1362 (7th \r\ned. 1999). Thus, for approximately fifteen years, the Parish was specifically \r\nclaiming to a third party that it held the property in fee simple. [24] Â  During this fifteen-year \r\ntime period, the Does did not challenge the Parishâ€™s claim of ownership, even \r\nthough a default on the mortgage could have resulted in foreclosure. \r\nPrejudice \r\n  is arguably shown because to allow the Does to assert ownership of the property \r\n  after such a delay could cause the outstanding balances on the mortgages to \r\n  come due immediately. Â See Arceneaux, 284 S.C. at 503, \r\n  327 S.E.2d at 358 (holding a claim is barred by laches if the delay prejudices \r\n  the other party).\r\nViewing \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the Diocese and the National Church, \r\n  there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Doesâ€™ claims \r\n  are barred by laches.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment \r\n  in favor of the Does on the issue of laches. See George, 345 S.C. \r\n  at 452, 548 S.E.2d at 874 (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition \r\n  of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\nE.Â Â Â Â Â  Staleness \r\nThe Diocese \r\n  and the National Church argue the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment \r\n  to the Does on the claim of staleness.Â  We agree.\r\nA stale \r\n  demand is â€œâ€˜one that has for a long time remained unasserted; one that is first \r\n  asserted after an unexplained delay of such great length as to render it difficult \r\n  or impossible for the court to ascertain the truth of the matters in controversy \r\n  and to do justice between the parties, or as to create a presumption against \r\n  the existence or validity of the claim, or a presumption that it has been abandoned \r\n  or satisfied.â€™â€ Pendarvis, 227 S.C. at 59, 86 S.E.2d at 744 (quoting \r\n  Bell v. Mackey, 191 S.C. 105, 123, 3 S.E.2d 816, 824 (1939)).\r\nWe find Pendarvis instructive \r\n  on this issue.Â  In Pendarvis, a trust was established in 1713. Pendarvis, \r\n  227 S.C. at 53, 86 S.E.2d at 741.Â  The deed was recorded in the Register of \r\n  Deeds Office for Charleston County within twenty years of the creation of the \r\n  trust. Id. at 56, 86 S.E.2d at 742.Â  However, the existence of the trust \r\n  was forgotten for the next 200 years. Id.Â  During this time period, the \r\n  church treated the property as its own. Id. at 52-56, 86 S.E.2d at 741-43.Â  \r\n  Because no successor trustees were appointed after the original trustees died, \r\n  no one representing the trust asserted ownership of the property pursuant to \r\n  the terms of the trust during this 200-year period. Id. at 54, 86 S.E.2d \r\n  at 742.Â  When the church decided to subdivide the property in 1945, the trust \r\n  was rediscovered and a suit was commenced to clear title to the property. Id. \r\n  at 56, 86 S.E.2d at 742.Â  In explaining numerous reasons not to enforce the \r\n  trust, our supreme court reviewed these facts and then stated a court â€œshould \r\n  not now undertake to enforce this ancient trust.â€ Id. at 57, 86 S.E.2d \r\n  at 743.\r\nSimilarly, in the present case, a \r\n  trust established in 1745 was recorded in the Register of Deeds Office for Charleston \r\n  County approximately twenty years after the trustâ€™s creation. Â The trust \r\n  was then forgotten for the next 200 years, during which time the Parish treated \r\n  the property as its own. Â No successor trustees were appointed after \r\n  the original trustees died, and thus, no one representing the trust asserted \r\n  any ownership rights to the property during this 200-year period. Â The \r\n  trust was rediscovered in 1986 and still no claim was made by the descendants \r\n  of the trustees for another twenty years. Â It was not until the Diocese \r\n  gave notice to the Register of Deeds Office for Georgetown County that both \r\n  the Diocese and the National Church held an interest in the property that a \r\n  lawsuit was filed in which the Does eventually asserted a claim to the property. \r\n  \r\nViewing \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the Diocese and the National Church, \r\n  there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as whether the Doesâ€™ claims \r\n  were stale. [25] Â  See \r\n  id. at 59, 86 S.E.2d at 744.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred by granting \r\n  summary judgment in favor of the Does on the staleness claim.Â  See George, \r\n  345 S.C. at 452, 548 S.E.2d at 874 (â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€).\r\nIII. \r\n  Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nStandard \r\n  of Review\r\nâ€œLack \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€ \r\n  Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998); see Eaddy v. Eaddy, 283 S.C. 582, 584, 324 S.E.2d \r\n  70, 72 (1984) (â€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction . . . may be raised at any stage \r\n  of the proceeding.â€).\r\nA. Â Â Â Â  Ascertaining Beneficiaries\r\n\r\nThe Diocese and the National Church \r\n  argue the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to declare the Diocese \r\n  and the National Church to be incidental beneficiaries of the trust.Â  To the \r\n  extent the circuit court order does this, we agree and vacate.\r\nThe probate court has exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  to â€œascertain beneficiaries.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-201(a)(3) (Supp. 2002). \r\n  Â A beneficiary â€œinclud[es] a person who has any present or future interest, \r\n  vested or contingent . . . and, as it relates to a charitable trust, includes \r\n  any person entitled to enforce the trust.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(2) (1987).\r\nThe circuit \r\n  court found the Diocese and the National Church were â€œat best, incidental beneficiariesâ€ \r\n  to the trust. Â To the extent that the circuit courtâ€™s statement was a \r\n  finding that the Diocese and the National Church were incidental beneficiaries, \r\n  we vacate.\r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Personal Property \r\nThe Diocese \r\n  and the National Church argue the circuit court erred by declaring it did not \r\n  have subject matter jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the personal \r\n  property.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œ[T]he \r\n  probate court has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings initiated by interested \r\n  parties concerning the internal affairs of trusts.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-201 \r\n  (Supp. 2002).\r\nIn its \r\n  complaint, the Parish sought a declaration that it owned the personal property \r\n  located on the real property. Â The Diocese and the National Church counterclaimed \r\n  for a declaration that all personal property located on the real property was \r\n  owned by the Parish, subject to an interest held by both the Diocese and the \r\n  National Church.Â  \r\nAfter \r\n  the circuit court determined the holders of both legal and equitable title to \r\n  the real property, the circuit court stated it had â€œno further jurisdiction \r\n  regarding this case.â€ Â In the Rule 59(e), South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure, motions to alter or amend the judgment, the Diocese and the National \r\n  Church noted the issue of personal property had not been resolved.Â  The circuit \r\n  court did not address this issue in its order denying the motion.Â  \r\nThe language \r\n  of the trust deed refers only to real property. [26]  Â Â Thus, because the \r\n  personal property is not subject to the trust, the probate court cannot have \r\n  exclusive jurisdiction over the personal property.Â  Accordingly, we remand this \r\n  issue to the circuit court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased \r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nVACATED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART \r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL \r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The Pawleys received the property \r\n    from John Hutchinsonâ€™s widow in 1731.Â  John Hutchinson received the property \r\n    in 1711 as a land grant from the Lords Proprietors. Â See Coburg \r\n    Dairy v. Lesser, 318 S.C. 510, 512 n.1, 458 S.E.2d 547, 548 n.1 (1995) \r\n    (â€œFrom 1672 until 1730, grants of land were made by the Lords Proprietors \r\n    who were granted enormous tracts of land in America by Charles II, King of \r\n    England.Â  The Lords Proprietors owned all of Carolina and acted in the stead \r\n    of the sovereign in making land grants.â€). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In 1770, the Royal Privy Council disallowed the Parishâ€™s colonial \r\n    charter. However, in 1778, the Parish was recognized by the government of \r\n    the newly formed state of South Carolina. Â See Act No. 1071 \r\n    of Mar. 16, 1778, 4 Stat. 407; S.C. Const. of 1778, arts. XII-XIII.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  In 1839, the original Parish charter was â€œrevivedâ€ for a fourteen-year \r\n    term.Â  See Act No. 2788 of December 21, 1839, 11 Stat. 70.Â  The charter \r\n    was renewed for an unspecified term in 1852.Â  See Act No. 4081 of December \r\n    16, 1852, 12 Stat. 137.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  According to an 1880 statute, title to â€œall property belonging to \r\n    any of the corporations or churches or dormant parishes formerly connected \r\n    with the [Episcopal Church for the South Carolina Diocese], but which have \r\n    now ceased to have active operation . . . or whose charters of incorporation \r\n    may have expiredâ€ vested in the Diocese.Â  See Act No. 222 of Feb. 20, \r\n    1880, 17 Stat. 257.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The Diocese authorized these mortgages.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  The Parish also filed a motion for summary judgment asking the circuit \r\n    court to declare â€œthe subject property [was] governed by the 1745 Trust Deed, \r\n    and as a matter of law [the Diocese] and [the National Church] have no right \r\n    to assert any interest in the said property.â€Â  The circuit court declined \r\n    to rule on the Parishâ€™s motion because of its disposition on the Doesâ€™ motion.Â  \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Neither the Diocese nor the National Church filed a cross-motion \r\n    for summary judgment.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  The quoted language from the canons of the Diocese read, in part, \r\n    â€œ[a]ll real and personal property held by or for the benefit of any Parish, \r\n    Mission or Congregation is held in trust for the Episcopal Church and the \r\n    Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of South Carolina.â€ Â The \r\n    quoted language from the canons of the National Church was nearly identical. \r\n    Â Although the Parish claims it is not bound by these canons, the Parish \r\n    does not deny it has been affiliated with the National Church since as early \r\n    as 1820 and with the Diocese since at least 1903.Â  We note the interpretation \r\n    of the canons is an ecclesiastical dispute and beyond the jurisdiction of \r\n    the civil court. See Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of Americas \r\n    v. Greater Fuller Tabernacle Fire Baptized Holiness Church, 323 S.C. 418, \r\n    421-23, 475 S.E.2d 767, 769-70 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œThe trial court . . . found \r\n    that the issue of whether the 1975 deed comported with Church discipline so \r\n    as to effectively transfer the subject property to the National Church was \r\n    ecclesiastical in nature, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the civil \r\n    court . . . . [In affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision, this Court stated], \r\n    [t]he interpretation of the Discipline, and what it mandates, is a matter \r\n    for the ecclesiastical tribunal of the National Church, not the civil court.â€); \r\n    see also Seldon v.

See \r\n    First Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank v.

Short, 298 S.C. 348, \r\n    349-50, 380 S.E.2d 826, 827 (1989), to support the proposition that parol \r\n    evidence is inadmissible to vary the terms of a deed in the absence of fraud, \r\n    mistake, or other grounds for reformation or rescission. Â Because the \r\n    Diocese and the National Church sought to introduce the parol evidence to \r\n    explain the term, not to vary it, we hold the circuit court erred in its reliance \r\n    on Beckham. See Shelley v. Shelley, 244 S.C. 598, 606, \r\n    137 S.E.2d 851, 855 (1964) (â€œâ€˜[E]vidence is admissible which merely intends \r\n    to explain and apply what the testator has written.â€™â€ (quoting McCall v. \r\n    McCall, 25 S.C.

Eq. 447, 456 (1852))).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [13]  The Does and the National Church assert this argument only if, upon \r\n    remand, the Statute of Uses is determined not to execute the trust in a subsequent \r\n    circuit court proceeding.Â  If the Statute of Uses executed the trust in 1767, \r\n    the possibility that the trust failed in the 1770s as a result of the disestablishment \r\n    of the Church of England in the United States is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [14]  As part of its ruling, the circuit court concluded the trust did \r\n    not fail when the Church of England ceased to be recognized as the official \r\n    church in the United States. Â The Diocese and the National Church argued \r\n    against this ruling, alleging the trust failed once the Church of England \r\n    was no longer â€œestablished by lawâ€ as required by the language of the trust.Â  \r\n    The Diocese and the National Church make this argument in connection with \r\n    their assertion that the Parish holds the property by adverse possession.Â  \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [15]  A glebe is the â€œ[l]and possessed as part of the endowment or revenue \r\n    of a church or ecclesiastical benefice.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 698 \r\n    (7th ed. 1999).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [16]  The Parish began possession of the property once it was chartered \r\n    in 1767.Â  There is some dispute as to whether the Parish existed continuously \r\n    from 1767 to 1903.Â  Because our analysis on adverse possession is not affected \r\n    by the events of this time period, we decline to comment on this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [17]  On each occasion, the Parish obtained permission from the Diocese, \r\n    as required by the canons of the Diocese and the National Church. Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [18]  Although the Parish admits it was not aware of the trust until 1986, \r\n    the deed was properly recorded in 1767 and remained on record from that time.Â  \r\n    Thus, the Parish had constructive notice of the trust. Â Pendarvis, \r\n    227 S.C. at 57-58, 86 S.E.2d at 743 (holding the parties had constructive \r\n    notice of the 1713 trust because it was recorded in the office of the Register \r\n    of Deeds in 1732).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [19]  Even Frady does not preclude a party whose possession began \r\n    under permissive use from adversely possessing the property, so long as the \r\n    party â€œeither surrendered the possession or gave notice of an adverse possession.â€ \r\n    Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [20]  See footnote 17, supra.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [21]  The Diocese and National Church assert this argument only if the \r\n    Parish is determined to be the beneficiary of the trust during a subsequent \r\n    circuit court proceeding or the Parish is determined to be the trustee of \r\n    the trust in a subsequent probate court proceeding. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 62-7-201(a)(1) (Supp. 2002) (stating the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction \r\n    to appoint trustees).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [22]  See footnote 17, supra.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [23]  This lawsuit was commenced in 2000.Â  The Parish mortgaged the property \r\n    for a fifth time in 2001. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [24]  See footnote 17, supra.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [25]  The dispute between the parties concerning the term â€œinhabitants \r\n    on Waccamaw Neckâ€ in the present case exemplifies why it is â€œdifficult or \r\n    impossible for the court to ascertain the truth of the matters in controversy \r\n    and to do justice between the parties.â€ Pendarvis, 227 S.C. at 59, \r\n    86 S.E.2d at 744.Â  The Parish claims this term should be read according to \r\n    its plain meaning.Â  The Diocese and the National Church contend the term had \r\n    a special meaning in colonial times and referred to the political unit that \r\n    would exist once a parish was established.Â  In attempting to ascertain the \r\n    intent of the settlor, we note the extreme difficulty in determining which \r\n    of these meanings would have been more prevalent in colonial times. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [26]  In their brief, the Does concede the personal property is not subject \r\n    to the trust. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3758","title":"Walsh v.

Walsh (Walsh), brought this action against Walshâ€™s \r\n  former wife, Joyce K. Woods (Joyce). In her complaint, Frances seeks relief \r\n  pertaining to the disposition of surviving spouse benefits made available through \r\n  Walshâ€™s retirement plan.Â  Frances appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  Joyceâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWalsh married his first wife, Joyce, \r\n  in 1957, and the two separated in 1970. Although they continued to live apart, \r\n  Walsh and Joyce remained married for twenty years after their separation. Â In \r\n  1989, Walsh retired from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) after \r\n  approximately forty years of employment.Â  During his tenure at DuPont, Walsh \r\n  participated in a DuPont sponsored pension benefits plan governed by the Employee \r\n  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1001 et. seq. \r\n  (â€œERISAâ€). Contemporaneously with his retirement, Walsh signed a Post Retirement \r\n  Company-Paid Survivor Benefits and Spouse Benefit Option designating Joyce, \r\n  to whom he was still married, as the sole beneficiary of his surviving spouse \r\n  benefits plan in the event he predeceased her. Walshâ€™s monthly benefit was therefore \r\n  reduced by the amount necessary to cover the cost of the survivor benefit plan.Â  \r\n\r\nWalsh and Joyce were divorced by order \r\n  of the family court dated August 24, 1990. Â Incident to the divorce, \r\n  Walsh and Joyce entered into an agreement which the family court approved, adopted, \r\n  and incorporated into the divorce decree.Â  The decree provided, in relevant \r\n  part:\r\n[T]he parties shall sign whatever documents or other paperwork \r\n  that is necessary to enforce this Agreement.Â  I find that the parties have further \r\n  agreed that each shall retain what .Â  .Â  . retirement plans, pension plans .Â  \r\n  .Â  . etc., that he or she has in his or her possession.Â  If the wife is required \r\n  to sign any papers concerning the husbandâ€™s retirement or benefit options from \r\n  DuPont of Westinghouse, then she shall sign those. \r\nIt is undisputed Walsh \r\n  never presented Joyce with any documents to sign regarding his retirement benefits, \r\n  and that neither party attempted to obtain a Qualified Domestic Relations Order \r\n  (QDRO) reassigning the surviving spouse benefits during Walshâ€™s lifetime.\r\nOn May 31, 1991, Walsh advised DuPont \r\n  he was divorced from Joyce and desired to change the beneficiary of his pension \r\n  plan to his wife Frances and requested the paperwork for this purpose \r\n  [1] .Â  In 1994, Walsh married Frances, with whom he had been involved since \r\n  1980. Â Â Â On November 30, 1994, Walsh wrote to DuPont again advising the \r\n  company that he was married to Frances and wished to designate her as beneficiary \r\n  under his retirement plan, and that the company should send him any documentation \r\n  necessary to effectuate the change in beneficiary.Â  Despite the May 31, 1991 \r\n  letter and other subsequent communications with DuPont wherein Walsh referred \r\n  to Frances as his designated beneficiary, the change Walsh requested \r\n  was never made legally effective.Â  \r\nWalsh died testate on January 27, 1996. Pursuant \r\n  to the terms of his will, Frances became the sole beneficiary and the Personal \r\n  Representative of his estate.Â  \r\nIn 1997, Frances instituted an \r\n  action against DuPont, which was removed to federal court; seeking a judicial \r\n  finding that Walshâ€™s surviving spouse benefits (SSB) should be paid to her and \r\n  not Joyce.Â  DuPont moved for and was granted summary judgment based on the fact \r\n  that no QDRO existed terminating Joyceâ€™s right to receive the benefits at the \r\n  time of Walshâ€™s retirement. \r\nThereafter, Frances contacted John W. \r\n  Harte, the attorney who represented Walsh in his divorce from Joyce, and requested \r\n  that he prepare and submit a QDRO to DuPont.Â  Harte prepared the QDRO, then \r\n  contacted Vickie Johnson, the attorney who represented Joyce in the divorce \r\n  action, and requested that she obtain Joyceâ€™s signature on the document. Joyce \r\n  did not sign the QDRO but authorized Johnson to sign it on her behalf.Â  Joyce \r\n  noted on the document, however, that she authorized her signature under protest \r\n  and out of concern she would be held in contempt of court if she refused to \r\n  sign.Â  \r\nIn August of 1998, Harte submitted the \r\n  QDRO to DuPont.Â  In a letter dated September 16, 1998, DuPont advised Harte \r\n  that the document was unenforceable as a QDRO inasmuch as â€œ[a] QDRO cannot be \r\n  entered after the death of the participant. A participant must be a living person.Â  \r\n  There was no QDRO in effect at the participantâ€™s death that awarded any benefits \r\n  to an alternate payee.Â  Therefore, there are no benefits payable pursuant to \r\n  a QDRO.â€ In addition, the letter from DuPont advised that even if the document \r\n  had been prepared at some point prior to Walshâ€™s death, it would nonetheless \r\n  be ineffective to divest Joyce of her surviving spouse benefits inasmuch as \r\n  ERISA requires that married participants be offered qualified joint and survivor \r\n  annuities and their spouses must be offered the option to accept or waive the \r\n  benefit.Â Â  Once this election is made, it is irrevocable. \r\nFrances filed the instant action against \r\n  Joyce on December 18, 2000, seeking recovery under seven theories of relief: \r\n  1) unjust enrichment; 2) â€œlaw of the caseâ€; 3) res judicata; 4) collateral estoppel; \r\n  5) breach of contract; 6) bad faith breach of contract; and 7) conversion. Joyce \r\n  answered, denying Frances was entitled to the relief sought in her complaint, \r\n  and asserted as defenses: 1) expiration of the statute of limitations; 2) failure \r\n  to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; 3) laches; and 4) res\r\njudicata. \r\n\r\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  Joyce argued, inter alia, that all of Francesâ€™s causes \r\n  of actions failed because the surviving spouse benefits vested in Joyce in 1989, \r\n  at the time of Walshâ€™s retirement, and she could not now be divested of her \r\n  right to the benefits.Â Â  Joyce further asserted the applicable statute of limitations \r\n  bars the claims.Â  In support of her cross motion, Frances asserted generally \r\n  that no genuine issues of material fact existed and specifically that Joyce \r\n  had waived her rights to the benefits in the divorce decree.Â  In addition, Frances \r\n  asserted that the court could enforce the property settlement agreement by requiring \r\n  Joyce to disgorge herself of all surviving spouse benefit payments she had received \r\n  in the past and will receive in the future by transferring the payments to Frances.\r\n&nbsp;By order dated January 28, 2001, the trial \r\n  court granted Joyceâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Specifically, the court \r\n  cited Hopkins v. AT&amp;T, 105 F.3d 153, 157 (4th Cir. 1997), for the \r\n  propositions that 1) surviving spouse benefits vest in a plan participantâ€™s \r\n  current spouse on the date the participant retires, whether or not spouses are \r\n  married at the time the participant dies, and 2) surviving spouse benefits may \r\n  not be paid to a spouse who marries a participant after the participantâ€™s retirement. \r\n  The trial court expressly determined the holding in Hopkins was determinative \r\n  of the entire case and, therefore, declined to address Joyceâ€™s other grounds \r\n  for summary judgment and further declined to reach Francesâ€™s cross motion for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJoyce argues in her Petition for Rehearing that \r\n  the dispositive issue on appeal is whether Francesâ€™s claims based on contract \r\n  and/or conversion are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  We agree. \r\n\r\nThe statute of limitations begins to run at the \r\n  time the cause of action accrues.Â  Harvey v. S.C. Dept. of Corrections, \r\n  338 S.C. 500, 508, 527 S.E.2d 765, 769 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Matthews v. \r\n  City of Greenwood, 305 S.C. 267, 269, 407 S.E.2d 668, 669 (Ct. App. 1991)).Â  \r\n  In analyzing a limitations defense, â€œ[t]he fundamental test for determining \r\n  whether a cause of action has accrued is whether the party asserting the claim \r\n  can maintain an action to enforce it.â€Â  Id. (quoting Matthews, \r\n  305 S.C. at 269, 407 S.E.2d at 669).Â  Thus, a particular cause of action accrues \r\n  â€œat the moment when the plaintiff has a legal right to sue on it.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe statute of limitations for both an action upon \r\n  a contract and a conversion claim is three (3) years. S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-3-530(1) \r\n  and (5) (Supp. 2003).Â  Additionally, under Â§15-3-535 an action predicated on \r\n  an injury to the person or rights of another not arising on contract must be \r\n  brought within three years after the person knew â€œor by the exercise of reasonable \r\n  diligence should have known that he had a cause of action.â€Â  Thus, under the \r\n  discovery rule the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injured \r\n  party either knows or should have known by the exercise of due diligence that \r\n  a cause of action arises from the wrongful conduct.Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., \r\n  321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  A cause of action arises when \r\n  it â€œshould have been discovered through exercise of reasonable diligence when \r\n  the facts and circumstances would have put a person of common knowledge and \r\n  experience on notice that some right had been invaded or a claim against another \r\n  party might exist.â€Â  Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 377, 500 S.E.2d \r\n  204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nTo determine whether the statute of limitations \r\n  has run, the Court does not consider whether the particular plaintiff in the \r\n  case before it knew he or she had a claim but rather â€œwhether the circumstances \r\n  of the case would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice \r\n  that some right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against another \r\n  party might exist.â€Â  Young v. S.C. Department of Corrections, 333 S.C. \r\n  714, 719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nIn the instant case, Frances retained counsel to enforce \r\n  her rights to her husbandâ€™s SSB when she learned that DuPont was paying the \r\n  SSB to Joyce regardless of any waiver of her rights to the benefits or approval \r\n  of that waiver by the family court.Â  On November 20, 1997, United States District \r\n  Judge Matthew Perry dismissed the claims Frances brought against DuPont.Â  We \r\n  hold that this dismissal should have put Frances on notice, and would put any \r\n  person of common knowledge and experience on notice, that she individually and \r\n  on behalf of Mr. Walshâ€™s estate had a cause of action against Joyce.Â  Because \r\n  Frances did not file her complaint against Joyce until December 11, 2000, over \r\n  three years after Judge Perry issued his order, Francesâ€™s claims against Joyce \r\n  are barred by the statute of limitations. [2] Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â  \r\nSTILWELL and HOWARD, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Apparently, Walsh thought he had a common law \r\n    marriage with Frances.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Having decided that the cause of action is barred \r\n    by the applicable statute of limitations, we need not address the remaining \r\n    issues raised on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3759","title":"QZO v.

Little, of Atlanta, GA; and William E. Hopkins, \r\n  Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nBlaney A. Coskrey, III, John E. Schmidt, III, Travis Dayhuff, \r\n  and Daniel J. Westbrook, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Darrin Moyer (â€œAppellantâ€) appeals several rulings from \r\n  the Circuit Court in favor of QZO, Inc., d/b/a Palmetto Ambulance Service (â€œPalmettoâ€), \r\n  including the denial of Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss based on lack of personal \r\n  jurisdiction, the granting of a temporary restraining order (â€œTROâ€), the imposition \r\n  of sanctions for violating the TRO, and the courtâ€™s decision to strike Appellantâ€™s \r\n  answer and declare him in default.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case arises out of a dispute between former business partners.Â  Appellant, \r\n  a citizen and resident of Richmond County, Georgia, is a fifty percent owner/shareholder \r\n  in Palmetto, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Georgia.Â  \r\n  Palmetto provides ambulance services and maintains offices in Augusta, Georgia, \r\n  and Columbia, South Carolina. \r\nKeith Stille, the president of Palmetto and the \r\n  other fifty percent shareholder, commenced this action by verified complaint \r\n  dated February 28, 2002.Â  The complaint alleged Stille had reason to believe \r\n  Appellant intended to open a competing ambulance service in violation of the \r\n  South Carolina Trade Secrets Act. [1] Â  The complaint stated that Palmetto \r\n  had reason to believe a computer belonging to the company, but in Appellantâ€™s \r\n  possession, contained evidence of Appellantâ€™s wrongful acts.\r\nThe complaint requested a TRO enjoining Appellant from using any \r\n  proprietary information and ordering Appellant to surrender the computer either \r\n  to Palmetto or a neutral third party.\r\nHaving determined that the information in Palmettoâ€™s computer was \r\n  in danger of being altered or destroyed before a hearing on the matter could \r\n  be accomplished, and that irreparable harm would result if the TRO were not \r\n  issued, the Circuit Court granted the TRO on the same day the original complaint \r\n  was filed.Â  The TRO ordered Appellant to immediately surrender Palmettoâ€™s computer \r\n  upon receipt of the order.\r\nAlthough the TRO was issued on February 28, 2002, and served on the \r\n  Appellant that same day, Appellant did not turn over the computer until seven \r\n  days later.Â  Upon receipt, counsel for Palmetto hired a computer expert to inspect \r\n  and retrieve any pertinent information that might be located on the computerâ€™s \r\n  hard drive.Â  However, the expertâ€™s examination revealed that the hard drive \r\n  was reformatted a day before the computer had been turned over to Palmetto, \r\n  effectively erasing any information the computer may have contained.\r\nOn March 8, 2002, and again on March 22, 2002, Palmetto filed amended \r\n  complaints adding additional grounds of liability as well as two more defendants.Â  \r\n  In a motion dated April 24, 2002, Appellant moved to dismiss the case pursuant \r\n  to Rule 12(b), SCRCP.Â  Specifically, Appellant averred the case should be dismissed \r\n  based on Rule 12(b)(1) â€“ lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 12(b)(2) â€“ lack \r\n  of personal jurisdiction; and 12(b)(8) â€“ that another action was pending between \r\n  the parties concerning the same subject matter as the current suit.\r\nBefore Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss was heard, Palmetto moved pursuant \r\n  to Rule 37, SCRCP, for sanctions to be imposed on Appellant for what Palmetto \r\n  alleged was a willful violation of the TRO issued by the court on February 28, \r\n  2002.Â  On July 9, 2002, a hearing was held concerning both motions.Â  In an order \r\n  dated July 30, 2002, the trial court denied Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss and \r\n  granted Palmettoâ€™s motion for sanctions.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nSpecifically, the court found Appellant willfully destroyed evidence \r\n  relevant to Palmettoâ€™s case.Â  Thereafter, while recognizing the severity of \r\n  the sanction, the trial court struck Appellantâ€™s pleadings and entered a judgment \r\n  of liability in favor of Palmetto.\r\nAppellant filed a motion to reconsider and a hearing was held on \r\n  September 30, 2002.Â  In an order dated October 8, 2002, the trial court reaffirmed \r\n  its earlier rulings and denied Appellantâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in denying Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss based on lack \r\n  of personal jurisdiction?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in issuing a TRO that provided no opportunity for Appellant \r\n  to be heard?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in sanctioning Appellant for an alleged violation of \r\n  the TRO?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the \r\n  trial court err in striking Appellantâ€™s answer and entering a default judgment \r\n  of liability in favor of Palmetto?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Denial of \r\n  Motion to Dismiss\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in failing to grant its motion to dismiss \r\n  based on lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough a pre-trial motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction \r\n  is not usually immediately appealable, it can be considered when other appealable \r\n  issues are presented to an appellate court.Â  See Mid-State Distribs., \r\n  Inc. v. Century Imps., Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 (1993); Cox \r\n  v. Woodmen ofÂ  the World Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 460, 556 S.E.2d 397 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).\r\nA two-step process is utilized to determine whether or not a South Carolina \r\n  court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant.Â  Southern \r\n  Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992).Â  \r\n  The trial court must first consider whether South Carolinaâ€™s long-arm statute \r\n  applies. [2] Â  Should the court \r\n  find the statute does apply, it must then determine whether the defendantâ€™s \r\n  contacts with South Carolina are such that an exercise of personal jurisdiction \r\n  would comport with due process.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs the trial court correctly pointed out in its order denying Appellantâ€™s motion \r\n  to dismiss, Appellantâ€™s conduct clearly falls within the purview of the long-arm \r\n  statute.Â  First, when Appellant was an officer and director working for Palmetto, \r\n  his office was located in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  After leaving Palmetto, \r\n  Appellant began operating a competing ambulance service under the name of Regional \r\n  Ambulance Service, Inc., with its principal place of business in West Columbia, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Because Appellant was transacting business in this state, the \r\n  long-arm statute is satisfied.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803(1)(a) (2003) \r\n  (stating a court may exercise jurisdiction over a person transacting business \r\n  in South Carolina).\r\nMoreover, the long-arm statute is satisfied because Palmetto averred in its \r\n  complaint that the alleged wrongful conduct occurred within South Carolina.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803(1)(c) (2003) (jurisdiction exists over \r\n  a person committing a tortious act in whole or in part in South Carolina).\r\nSignificantly, the nature of Appellantâ€™s current business in South Carolina \r\n  would subject him to general jurisdiction as well under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-802 \r\n  (2003).Â  Section 802 reads as follows:Â  â€œA court may exercise personal jurisdiction \r\n  over a person domiciled in, organized under the laws of, doing business, \r\n  or maintaining his or its principal place of business in, this State \r\n  as to any cause of action.â€Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nFurthermore, Appellantâ€™s contacts with South Carolina are such that the exercise \r\n  of jurisdiction would comport with due process.Â  In order for states to exercise \r\n  jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, due process requires that the defendant \r\n  have minimum contacts with the forum state â€œsuch that maintenance of the suit \r\n  does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.â€Â  \r\n  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291-92 (1980).\r\nThe due process analysis involves a two-step inquiry.Â  First, it must be determined \r\n  if the party has minimum contacts with the forum state.Â  One way to determine \r\n  whether a party has minimum contacts with a state is to determine whether he \r\n  or she â€œshould reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.â€Â  Burger \r\n  King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985).Â  Clearly, Appellantâ€™s \r\n  contacts were such in South Carolina that he should reasonably anticipate â€œbeing \r\n  haled into court [here].â€Â  He currently owns and operates a business in South \r\n  Carolina, worked for Palmetto in South Carolina, and allegedly committed the \r\n  complained of acts in South Carolina.Â  Thus, Appellant has the requisite minimum \r\n  contacts with the state to satisfy due process.\r\nSimilarly, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice would \r\n  not be offended by exercise of jurisdiction over Appellant.Â  To determine whether \r\n  an exercise of jurisdiction would comport with this standard, a number of factors \r\n  must be considered, including: (1) the duration of Appellantâ€™s activity in this \r\n  state; (2) the nature and circumstances of Appellantâ€™s acts; (3) inconvenience \r\n  to the parties by either the exercise or refusal to exercise jurisdiction; and \r\n  (4) South Carolinaâ€™s interest in exercising jurisdiction over the action.Â  Clark \r\n  v. Key, 304 S.C. 497, 405 S.E.2d 599 (1991).Â  This standard is met as well.Â  \r\n  Appellant maintained activity in South Carolina the entire time he worked for \r\n  Palmetto, and currently runs another business in this state.Â  All the acts of \r\n  which Palmetto complains occurred in South Carolina.Â  The exercise of jurisdiction \r\n  would not inconvenience the parties because Appellant currently runs a business \r\n  located in this state.Â  Finally, South Carolina has an interest in exercising \r\n  personal jurisdiction over this action because the acts complained of occurred \r\n  here.\r\nBecause we find Appellantâ€™s conduct falls within the purview of the long-arm \r\n  statute and comports with due process, we hold that the trial court did not \r\n  err in its refusal to grant Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss.\r\nAppellant avers that South Carolinaâ€™s â€œdoor closing statuteâ€ [3]  prevents a non-resident corporation from bringing \r\n  an action against a non-resident citizen within South Carolina.Â  Indubitably, \r\n  the â€œdoor closing statuteâ€ does NOT involve subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  See Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003).Â  \r\n  Because Appellant did not raise this argument below, it is not preserved for \r\n  our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal.â€).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  TRO\r\nAppellant makes a number of arguments concerning the TRO the court \r\n  issued on Palmettoâ€™s behalf.Â  However, these issues were not raised in the court \r\n  below and they are not preserved for our review.Â  See Regions Bank \r\n  v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Sanctions and Default Judgment\r\nBecause issues three and four are related, we find it prudent to \r\n  address them simultaneously.Â  Appellant contends the trial court erred by granting \r\n  sanctions, ordering Appellantâ€™s answer to be struck, and entering a default \r\n  judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision of whether or not to award sanctions is generally entrusted to \r\n  the discretion of the trial court.Â  See Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. \r\n  Orangeburg, 354 S.C. 445, 581 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2003) (decision of what \r\n  kind and whether to impose discovery sanctions is left to sound discretion of \r\n  Circuit Court); Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co., 327 S.C. 538, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 1997) (noting that imposition of sanctions is generally \r\n  entrusted to sound discretion of Circuit Court); see also Stone v. \r\n  Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 369 S.E.2d 840 (1988) (stating that contempt \r\n  decision should be reversed only when without evidentiary support or upon an \r\n  abuse of discretion by the trial court).Â  An appellate court will not disturb \r\n  this decision unless the trial court abused its discretion.Â  Griffin Grading \r\n  &amp; Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., 334 S.C. 193, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  716 (Ct. App. 1999); see also Karppi, 327 S.C. at 542, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  at 681 (stating that trial courtâ€™s exercise of its discretionary powers with \r\n  respect to sanctions imposed in discovery matters will be interfered with by \r\n  the Court of Appeals only if abuse of discretion has occurred).\r\nThe burden is on the appealing party to show the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in imposing sanctions for failing to comply with a discovery order.

Berry, 302 S.C. 97, 394 S.E.2d 7 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990).Â  \r\nAdditionally, it is undisputed that Appellant did not turn the computer over \r\n  to Palmetto until seven days after issuance of the TRO.Â  When the computer was \r\n  eventually turned over, it became clear that the hard-drive had been formatted \r\n  the day before, effectively erasing any information contained therein.Â  We conclude \r\n  there was evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that Appellant willfully \r\n  violated the TRO.\r\nAppellant asserts the trial court did not consider \r\n  the severity of the sanction when he ordered Appellantâ€™s pleadings struck.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  The trial court specifically mentioned in its order that â€œ[a]lthough \r\n  it is a severe sanction, the Court strikes [Appellantâ€™s pleadings] . . . in \r\n  response to [Appellantâ€™s] intentional defiance of this Courtâ€™s order of February \r\n  28, 2002 and his willful destruction of evidence.â€\r\nAppellant cites Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co., 327 S.C. \r\n  538, 489 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 1997), in support of his argument.Â  However, Karppi \r\n  is factually distinguishable from the present case.Â  In Karppi, this \r\n  Court held that the trial courtâ€™s sanction of striking the answer of a defendant \r\n  was unduly harsh under the circumstances, especially because of the profound \r\n  effect it had on the co-defendant to the litigation.Â  Here, the only party punished \r\n  is the Appellant, the party who clearly and willfully committed the misconduct.\r\nThe sanction imposed in the case of Griffin Grading &amp; Clearing, \r\n  Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., 334 S.C. 193, 511 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999), is similar to the sanction in the case sub judice.Â  After \r\n  Griffin Grading filed suit against Tire Service, the circuit judge struck Tire \r\n  Serviceâ€™s answer as a discovery sanction.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals determined \r\n  that the striking of Tire Serviceâ€™s answer as a discovery sanction was warranted \r\n  based on Tire Serviceâ€™s failure to comply meaningfully with four prior orders \r\n  compelling discovery, even after the imposition of the assessment of attorney \r\n  fees and after Tire Service was warned of the consequences of its failure to \r\n  comply with the courtâ€™s order.\r\nThe trial court in the instant case complied with the standards articulated \r\n  in Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co., 327 S.C. 538, 489 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997), and Griffin Grading &amp; Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. \r\n  Mfg. Co., 334 S.C. 193, 511 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding sanctions or ordering \r\n  Appellantâ€™s answer stricken.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    See S.C.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, of \r\n  Columbia; Solicitor Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.: Â Brandon Heath Rogers appeals \r\n  his conviction of criminal domestic violence (CDV), arguing the circuit court \r\n  erred by (1) upholding the decision of the municipal court, which was the trial \r\n  court, finding him guilty of CDV; (2) failing to hold that the municipal court \r\n  erred by not granting a directed verdict to him; and (3) failing to file an \r\n  order setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to \r\n  Rule 52(a), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn the morning of March 24, 2002, Brandonâ€™s \r\n  wife, Rebecca Lynn Rogers, went to the Westminster Police Department to report \r\n  an incident of CDV allegedly perpetrated by Brandon against her.Â  According \r\n  to Rebeccaâ€™s written and signed statement, Brandon and she argued the previous \r\n  night while riding in their car.Â  Rebecca told police that while they were arguing, \r\n  Brandon â€œwas smacking me in my face and in my head.â€Â  Later, when they arrived \r\n  at a gas station, Rebecca stated Brandon â€œsmashed my face there.â€Â  The couple \r\n  then drove to their home, where Rebecca claimed in her written statement to \r\n  police that Brandon â€œbusted my windshield,â€ â€œsmacked me in the head,â€ and â€œpunched \r\n  me in the side of the stomach.â€Â  According to Rebeccaâ€™s statement, when the \r\n  couple entered their house, Brandon made Rebecca â€œget into bed,â€ â€œdared me out \r\n  with a knife,â€ â€œhit me again,â€ and told her he would â€œhurt me really badâ€ if \r\n  she contacted law enforcement.Â  Among other things, Rebecca stated that Brandon \r\n  â€œthreaten[ed] to kill my parents and my brother.â€\r\nAt trial before the municipal court on \r\n  May 9, 2002, Rebecca confirmed she had written and signed the statement.Â  Brandonâ€™s \r\n  attorney initially objected to having Rebecca read the statement into evidence.Â  \r\n  However, she agreed to allow Rebecca read the statement into evidence â€œsentence \r\n  by sentence[,] and at the end of each sentenceâ€ allow Rebecca to acknowledge \r\n  whether she made that portion of the statement, and make additional comments \r\n  about that portion of the statement. \r\nRebecca proceeded to read the statement \r\n  into evidence, frequently reacting to portions of the statement with claims \r\n  that she did not remember the incidents cited in the report.Â  However, when \r\n  she read a sentence that stated Brandon had â€œsmackedâ€ her at the gas station, \r\n  she did not refute its accuracy or question her memory of the incident.Â  Among \r\n  other things, she also acknowledged that Brandon hit her â€œin the sideâ€ but claimed \r\n  that his action was accidental.Â  Furthermore, when asked under cross-examination \r\n  whether Brandon â€œthreatened [her] with a knife,â€ she responded, â€œYeah.Â  I mean[,] \r\n  he didnâ€™t have a knife but he told be he could get something but he didnâ€™t have \r\n  one he didnâ€™t point one at me or anything.â€\r\nAt the trialâ€™s conclusion, the municipal \r\n  court found Brandon guilty of CDV, noting that he found Rebeccaâ€™s signed and \r\n  written statement more credible than her testimony in court.Â  Brandon received \r\n  a time-served sentence, which amounted to twenty days in jail.\r\nBrandon then appealed to the circuit court, only \r\n  â€œupon the grounds of inadequate evidence to support a conviction and utilization \r\n  of improper evidence.â€Â  Following a hearing, the circuit court affirmed the \r\n  municipal court.Â  Brandon then filed a Rule 52, SCRCP, motion seeking a written \r\n  order from the circuit court that enumerated its findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, rejecting Brandonâ€™s efforts to \r\n  invoke civil procedural rules in a criminal appeal.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Finding of Guilt on CDV Charge\r\nBrandon argues the municipal court erred \r\n  in finding him guilty of CDV.Â  We are constrained to disagree, for the simple \r\n  reason that Brandon seeks to pursue specious arguments and to assign error to \r\n  matters that were not raised in the lower courts.\r\nBrandon was charged with CDV under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-20 (Supp. 2001), which provides that â€œ[i]t is unlawful to: \r\n  (1) cause physical harm or injury to a personâ€™s own household member, (2) offer \r\n  or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a personâ€™s own household member \r\n  with apparent present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of \r\n  imminent peril.â€Â  Here, Brandon does not allege an error of law, but instead \r\n  argues that evidence in the record fails to support either the municipal courtâ€™s \r\n  conclusion of his guilt or the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of his conviction.Â  \r\n  Brandon clearly misconstrues our standard of review, for in criminal appeals \r\n  we sit to review errors of law only.Â  See City of Landrum v. Sarratt, \r\n  352 S.C. 139, 141, 572 S.E.2d 476, 477 (Ct.App. 2002) (â€œIn criminal appeals \r\n  from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de \r\n  novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate \r\n  exception.Â  In reviewing criminal cases, [the court of appeals] may review \r\n  errors of law only.â€) (emphasis added). \r\n  [1] \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict\r\nBrandon argues that the circuit court erred in \r\n  failing to hold that the municipal court erred by not granting Rogers a directed \r\n  verdict.Â  However, Brandon neither made a directed verdict motion in the trial \r\n  court nor raised the issue in his intermediate appeal to the circuit court.Â Â  \r\n  Thus, the issue is not preserved, and we cannot address it.Â  See City \r\n  of Columbia v. Ervin, 330 S.C. 516, 519-20, 500 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1998)Â  \r\n  (an issue not raised in an intermediate appeal cannot be considered in a subsequent \r\n  appeal to the court of appeals or supreme court); Graniteville Mfg. Co. v. \r\n  Renew, 113 S.C. 171, 171, 102 S.E. 18, 19 (1920) (an issue not made before \r\n  the circuit court on appeal from a magistrate is not properly before the appellate \r\n  court.).\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Rule 52(a), SCRCP, Motion \r\nBrandon argues the circuit court erred in denying \r\n  his motionÂ  pursuant to Rule 52(a), SCRCP, seeking an order setting forth the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  We find this argument \r\n  unavailing, because the CDV charge against Brandon was a criminal matter to \r\n  which the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply.Â  See \r\n  Rule 1, SCRCP (stating â€œ[t]hese rules govern the procedures in all South Carolina \r\n  courts in all suits of a civil nature â€¦.).Â  Moreover, as noted above, the circuit \r\n  court, sitting in its appellate capacity, may not engage in fact finding.Â  We \r\n  find this issue meritless.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the judgment \r\n  of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  The standard of appellate review in circuit court from a civil \r\n    judgment in magistrate court differs markedly from its criminal counterpart \r\n    in magistrate or municipal court.Â  See Parks v. Characters Night \r\n    Club, 345 S.C. 484, 490, 548 S.E.2d 605, 609 (Ct. App. 2001) (construing \r\n    S.C. Code Ann.

McCulloch, Jr., both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAnthony D. Hoefer, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.: Â Â  Fleet Capital Leasing â€“ Technology \r\n  Finance (â€œFleetâ€) sought to enforce a Michigan default judgment against Seal \r\n  Jet of the Carolinas, Inc. (â€œSeal Jetâ€) pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement \r\n  of Foreign Judgments Act, South Carolina Code Annotated section 15-35-900 â€“ \r\n  960 (Supp. 2002).Â  Seal Jet defended, asserting the default judgment was void \r\n  because the Michigan court did not have personal jurisdiction over it.Â  The \r\n  circuit court found Seal Jet made a general appearance in the Michigan case, \r\n  and thus, the Michigan court had personal jurisdiction.Â  Furthermore, the circuit \r\n  court entered the judgment of $18,345.97, plus interest, against Seal Jet.Â  \r\n  Seal Jet appeals, arguing the circuit court erred by holding res judicata precluded \r\n  Seal Jet from raising the issue of personal jurisdiction as a defense to the \r\n  South Carolina proceeding.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFleet brought suit in Michigan against \r\n  Seal Jet, alleging it was formerly known as American High Performance Seals, \r\n  Inc. (â€œAmericanâ€), and was liable for breach of various leases signed by American.Â  \r\n  The complaint alleged the leases were subject to Michigan law. \r\nDaniel Hughes, President of Seal Jet, was served \r\n  with the summons and complaint.Â  Hughes responded to the suit by writing a letter \r\n  to the Michigan District Court denying Seal Jet was a party to the leases and \r\n  asking for a jury trial. \r\nThe Michigan court viewed this letter \r\n  as Seal Jetâ€™s answer to the lawsuit.Â  Fleet moved to strike the answer, arguing \r\n  a corporation can only appear through a licensed attorney.Â  Fleet asserted the \r\n  answer was therefore void and should be stricken. \r\nThe Michigan District Court granted Fleetâ€™s motion, \r\n  striking Hughesâ€™ letter.Â  Further, because this meant Seal Jet had not answered \r\n  the complaint, the Michigan court entered a default judgment against Seal Jet. \r\n\r\nFleet then submitted its Notice of Filing \r\n  of Foreign Judgment to the South Carolina circuit court to enroll the Michigan \r\n  judgment in South Carolina pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments \r\n  Act.Â  Seal Jet filed a motion for relief from the judgment.Â  Seal Jet asserted \r\n  that the Michigan court did not have personal jurisdiction over Seal Jet and \r\n  that Seal Jet and American were separate entities.Â  Seal Jet also contested \r\n  the merits of the underlying suit.Â  \r\nThe circuit court ruled Seal Jet could \r\n  not contest the merits of the Michigan action because to do so would be an impermissible \r\n  collateral attack in violation of the Full Faith and Credit clause of the United \r\n  States Constitution. U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 1.Â  Relying upon this courtâ€™s opinion \r\n  in Colonial Pacific Leasing Corp. v. Taylor, 326 S.C. 529, 484 S.E.2d \r\n  595 (Ct. App. 1997), the circuit court concluded Seal Jet had made a general \r\n  appearance in Michigan by means of Hughesâ€™ letters [1]  and was precluded by principles of res judicata from arguing \r\n  the Michigan court did not have personal jurisdiction.Â  The court entered judgment \r\n  against Seal Jet in the amount of $18,345.97 plus interest.Â  Seal Jet appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSeal Jet argues the circuit court erred by holding \r\n  res judicata precluded Seal Jet from raising the issue of personal jurisdiction \r\n  as a defense in the South Carolina proceeding.Â  We agree and remand.\r\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United \r\n  States Constitution requires the courts of one state give â€œsuch force and effect \r\n  to a foreign judgment as the judgment would receive in its own state.â€Â  Taylor, \r\n  326 S.C. at 532, 484 S.E.2d at 597; see U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 1 (â€œFull \r\n  Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and \r\n  judicial proceedings of every other State.â€).Â  However, â€œ[t]he Full Faith and \r\n  Credit Clause does not prevent the litigation of personal jurisdiction in an \r\n  action to enforce a foreign judgmentâ€ if the party did not make a general appearance \r\n  in the foreign jurisdiction. Taylor, 326 S.C. at 532-33, 484 S.E.2d at \r\n  596-97 (â€œOnly a defendant who â€˜remains aloofâ€™ by not making an appearance and \r\n  has a default judgment entered against him may contest the issue of personal \r\n  jurisdiction in a later proceeding.â€); see Alladin Plastics, Inc. \r\n  v. Wintenna, Inc., 301 S.C. 90, 92, 390 S.E.2d 370, 371 (Ct. App. 1990) \r\n  (â€œ[A] court is bound to enforce the judgment of a court in another state only \r\n  if the court in the other state had jurisdiction to render the judgment.â€); \r\n  see also Taylor, 326 S.C. at 533, 484 S.E.2d at 597 (â€œâ€˜A defendant \r\n  who appears [in the foreign jurisdiction] to litigate the merits without properly \r\n  preserving an objection to personal jurisdiction waives the right to raise the \r\n  objection in the initial proceeding and is bound by the resulting judgment.â€™â€ \r\n  (quoting Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice \r\n  and Procedure Â§ 4430 (1981))).\r\nIn determining whether a party made a \r\n  general appearance in the foreign jurisdiction, the laws of the state that rendered \r\n  the judgment must be applied.Â  Loyd &amp; Ringâ€™s Wholesale Nursery, Inc. \r\n  v. Long &amp; Woodley Landscaping and Garden Center, Inc., 315 S.C. 88, \r\n  91, 431 S.E.2d 632, 634 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œThe validity and effect of a foreign \r\n  judgment must be determined by the laws of the state that rendered the judgment.â€).Â  \r\n  Therefore, we look to Michigan law to resolve the issue of whether Hughesâ€™ letter \r\n  served as a general appearance by the corporation, Seal Jet. \r\nIn Michigan, â€œany action on the part of a defendant \r\n  that recognizes the pending proceedings, with the exception of objecting to \r\n  the courtâ€™s jurisdiction, will [normally] constitute a general appearance.â€ \r\n  Penny v. ABA Pharm. Co., 511 N.W.2d 896, 897 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993); see \r\n  Ragnone v. Wirsing, 367 N.W.2d 369, 370 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985) (â€œTwo requirements \r\n  must be met to render an act adequate to support the inference that there is \r\n  an appearance: (1) â€˜knowledge of the pending proceedingsâ€™ and (2) â€˜an intention \r\n  to appear.â€™â€ (quoting Rhodes v. Rhodes, 142 N.W.2d 508, 511 (Mich. Ct. \r\n  App. 1966)));Â  Deeb v. Berri, 325 N.W.2d 493, 496 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982) \r\n  (â€œThis Court has held that â€˜appearâ€™ as it is used in default proceedings should \r\n  be taken â€˜in its generic senseâ€™ as any act of a party acknowledging jurisdiction \r\n  of a court or invoking court action on his behalf.â€ (quoting Rhodes, \r\n  142 N.W.2d at 510)). Thus, as an initial matter, we note a letter sent to the \r\n  Michigan District Court that denies liability and asks for a jury trial is one \r\n  means of making a general appearance in Michigan.\r\nOur inquiry then becomes whether, under Michigan \r\n  law, a corporation makes a general appearance when its president sends such \r\n  a letter to the court.\r\nAccording to Michigan law, â€œ[a] party who enters \r\n  a general appearance and contests a cause of action on the merits submits to \r\n  the courtâ€™s jurisdiction.â€Â  Penny, 511 N.W.2d at 897.Â  A corporation \r\n  named as a party in a Michigan lawsuit can only appear through an attorney.Â  \r\n  Detroit Bar Assâ€™n v. Union Guardian Trust Co., 281 N.W. 432, 433 (Mich. \r\n  1938) (â€œWhile an individual may appear in proper person, a corporation, because \r\n  of the very fact of its being a corporation, can appear only by attorney, regardless \r\n  of whether it is interested in its own corporate capacity or in a fiduciary \r\n  capacity.â€); Peters Production, Inc. v. Desnick Broadcasting Co., 429 \r\n  N.W.2d 654, 655 (Mich. Ct. App. 1988) (â€œAn individual may appear in propria \r\n  persona; a corporation, however, can appear only by attorney regardless \r\n  of whether it is interested in its own corporate capacity or in a fiduciary \r\n  capacity.â€). \r\nAfter being served with a summons and complaint, \r\n  Hughes responded to the suit by writing a letter to the Michigan District Court \r\n  denying Seal Jet was a party to the lease and asking for a jury trial. \r\nAt the Michigan hearing, Fleet moved to strike \r\n  Hughesâ€™ letter, arguing the letter did not constitute an appearance by the corporation \r\n  and was void.Â  The Michigan District Court agreed.\r\nIt stands to reason that a person who is legally \r\n  incapable of representing a corporation in a court proceeding and whom the court \r\n  refuses to recognize for that purpose cannot bind the corporation by his actions.Â  \r\n  Although it may be true that Hughes intended to contest the merits of the lawsuit, \r\n  it is inconsistent to state Hughesâ€™ letter must be stricken from the court record \r\n  because Hughes was not authorized to speak for the corporation, and the letter \r\n  must be imputed to Seal Jet for purposes of determining if the corporation made \r\n  a general appearance.Â  \r\nOnce the letter was struck as not being an action \r\n  of the corporation, there was no evidence of a general appearance by the corporation \r\n  in the Michigan court proceedings.Â  In addition, there is no indication \r\n  in the record that the issue of personal jurisdiction has been previously litigated \r\n  by Seal Jet.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred by concluding res judicata precluded \r\n  Seal Jet from raising the issue of personal jurisdiction as a defense in this \r\n  proceeding. [2] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment \r\n  of the court is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED for further \r\n  proceedings.Â  \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Hughes wrote several letters to the Michigan District Court arguing \r\n    the merits of his defense and asking for procedural guidance.Â  All of the \r\n    letters were written by Hughes as the president and presiding officer of Seal \r\n    Jet.Â  There was no intercession by an attorney on behalf of Seal Jet, and \r\n    ultimately, none of Hughesâ€™ letters was recognized by the Michigan court as \r\n    a basis for relief.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Seal Jet also argues the circuit court erred by enrolling the Michigan \r\n    judgment because the Michigan court did not have sufficient evidence to conclude \r\n    Seal Jet was the same entity as American.Â  This issue involves the merits \r\n    of the case.Â  Thus, we decline to rule on this issue.Â  See Hamilton \r\n    v.

Aiken, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This is an action under the \r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act. Â The South Carolina Department of Transportation \r\n  (SCDOT) appeals the damages awards to Calvin L. Jeter, Quantilla Jeter, and \r\n  Phyllis P. Brown, arguing the trial court erred in (1) moving the action to \r\n  Fairfield County, (2) directing a verdict on the issue of Brownâ€™s negligence, \r\n  and (3) refusing to charge the defense of unavoidable accident.Â  We affirm in \r\n  part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nCalvin Jeter was operating a motorcycle on Secondary \r\n  Road 37, also known as Herbert Road, in Union County on July 12, 1997.Â  SCDOT \r\n  had recently resurfaced a portion of the road and left behind loose gravel.Â  \r\n  Phyllis Brown, Jeterâ€™s sister, was driving her vehicle in the opposite direction \r\n  when she saw a deer on the side of the road and applied her brakes.Â  Brown \r\n  lost control of her car, which collided with Jeterâ€™s motorcycle before falling \r\n  down a ravine. \r\nSeveral people who saw the road at or near the \r\n  time of the accident testified there was enough loose gravel on the road to \r\n  scoop up handfuls of it.Â  At trial, there was conflicting testimony from \r\n  eyewitnesses and SCDOT employees regarding whether any signs warning of loose \r\n  stones were posted at the time of the accident.Â  Brown maintained excess \r\n  gravel left on the road during the resurfacing caused her car to swerve into \r\n  Jeterâ€™s lane of travel when she applied her brakes.Â Â  \r\nJeter and his wife Quantilla filed two complaints \r\n  against SCDOT in the Union County Court of Common Pleas under the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act, alleging SCDOT had failed to maintain the road in a safe condition \r\n  and to warn travelers on the road that dangerous conditions existed.Â  Contending \r\n  Brown was a necessary party to the litigation so as to allow for apportionment \r\n  of fault under section 15-78-100(c) of the Act, [1]  SCDOT filed a third-party complaint in each action naming Brown \r\n  as a third-party defendant.Â  Brown then filed an answer and counterclaim \r\n  against SCDOT under the Act for personal injuries she allegedly sustained during \r\n  the accident.\r\nBrown later settled with the Jeters and \r\n  then moved under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, to dismiss the third-party complaint \r\n  filed against her.Â  The trial court ruled that, under Rule 19, SCRCP, \r\n  Brown was a necessary party to the action â€œsolely for the purposes of satisfying \r\n  the statutory requirement of section 15-78-100(c), that the trier of fact must \r\n  apportion liability in a special verdict specifying the proportion of monetary \r\n  liability of each defendant.â€ \r\nBrown then filed an amended answer and counterclaim, \r\n  in which she objected to venue in Union County.Â  Several days later, \r\n  she moved for a change of venue to Fairfield County based on the fact that she \r\n  was a resident of that county.Â  Over SCDOTâ€™s objection, the trial court \r\n  granted the motion and transferred the case to Fairfield County.Â  \r\nDuring the merits hearing, Brown moved for directed \r\n  verdicts on the issue of her negligence and SCDOTâ€™s defense of unavoidable accident.Â  \r\n  The Jeters joined in the motions.Â  After hearing arguments from counsel, \r\n  the trial court granted both motions.Â  Based on the finding that Brown \r\n  was not negligent as a matter of law, the trial court declined to submit to \r\n  the jury a special verdict form that would have allowed the jury to apportion \r\n  fault pursuant to South Carolina Code section 15-78-100(c).\r\nThe jury returned verdicts of $1,950,000 for Calvin \r\n  Jeter, $100,000 for Quantilla Jeter, and $150,000 for Brown.Â  By consent \r\n  order, the trial court reduced the verdicts in accordance with the statutory \r\n  caps set forth in the Act. [2] Â  After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial absolute \r\n  on numerous grounds, SCDOT filed this appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  SCDOT argues the trial court erred in trying \r\n  the case in Fairfield County instead of Union County.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Jeters brought this action under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Section 15-78-100(b) of the Act provides that â€œ[j]urisdiction \r\n  for any action brought under this chapter is in the circuit court and brought \r\n  in the county in which the act or omission occurred.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nSCDOT argues section 15-78-100(b) â€œprovides that \r\n  only the Circuit Court in the county where the act or omission occurred has \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction over an action brought pursuant to the Tort Claims \r\n  Act.â€Â  According to SCDOTâ€™s reasoning, because the accident occurred \r\n  in Union County, the Union County Court of Common Pleas had exclusive subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to hear this action.\r\nWe agree, however, with Brown and the Jeters that \r\n  section 15-78-100(b) addresses the issue of jurisdiction only so far as to confer \r\n  jurisdiction to hear such cases in the â€œcircuit courtâ€ [4]  while the remaining language in that section, â€œand brought \r\n  in the county in which the act or omission occurred,â€ addresses the issue of \r\n  venue. [5] Â  The caption to section \r\n  15-78-100 reads in pertinent part â€œWhen and where to institute action.â€ \r\n  [6] Â  Moreover, nothing in part (b) of the statute can be read to require \r\n  that a case arising under the Act must be â€œheardâ€ or â€œtriedâ€ in â€œthe county \r\n  in which the act or omission occurred.â€ \r\n  [7]   \r\nWe therefore hold section 15-78-100(b) did not \r\n  prohibit the trial court from considering Brownâ€™s motion to change venue.Â  Moreover, \r\n  considering the fact that Brown resided in Fairfield County, we hold the trial \r\n  court acted within its discretion in granting the motion. [8] Â  Because the action was originally \r\n  brought in Union County, where the accident occurred, we further hold the requirements \r\n  of section 15-78-100(b) were satisfied. [9] \r\n2.Â  We agree, however, with SCDOTâ€™s argument that the \r\n  trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of Brown on the issue of her \r\n  negligence and in not allowing the jury to apportion fault among all potential \r\n  tortfeasors, including Brown, as provided in South Carolina Code section 15-78-100(c). \r\n  [10] \r\nIn South Carolina, motorists have a common law duty \r\n  to keep a reasonable lookout to avoid hazards on the roadway. \r\n  [11]  Â In addition, motorists are required by statute to adjust their speeds \r\n  to reasonable and prudent levels considering the â€œactual and potential hazards \r\n  then existingâ€ [12]  and to drive their vehicles \r\n  within their lanes of travel. [13] \r\n  Â  \r\nSeveral witnesses testified \r\n  â€œloose stoneâ€ warning signs were in place at the time of the accident.Â  Larry \r\n  Crocker, a sign foreman for SCDOT, testified he was working in the area the \r\n  day before the accident and made sure signs warning of loose stones were in \r\n  place.Â  In addition, Junior Jenkins, who worked on Crockerâ€™s crew, testified \r\n  â€œthey have to put the signs up before anything hits the highway.â€Â  Finally, \r\n  Martha Jolly, a resident maintenance foreman for SCDOT, testified (1) the road \r\n  was resurfaced the day before the accident, (2) she was on the site the day \r\n  before the accident and saw warning signs erected on the road, and (3) such \r\n  signs normally stay up a few days after the work is done.Â  Although there \r\n  was some testimony suggesting the signs were not easily visible when the accident \r\n  occurred, the evidence to the contrary created a jury question on this \r\n  issue. [14] Â  A finding by the jury the signs had been in place could have \r\n  led to the inference that Brown had failed to keep her vehicle under control \r\n  and adjust her speed to conditions of which she either was or should have been \r\n  aware.\r\nSimilarly, there was evidence the hazards were open \r\n  and obvious.Â  Dr. Robert B. Roberts, who investigated the scene seventeen days \r\n  after the accident testified he could observe clearly where the road had been \r\n  re-surfaced.Â  Dr. Larry Josey, the Jetersâ€™ expert witness, opined a reasonable \r\n  person could visually recognize the road had been re-surfaced and Brown â€œshould \r\n  have been able to tell that this is a new piece of roadway.â€Â  In addition, \r\n  Quantilla Jeter testified she could see where the road construction started \r\n  when she arrived at the scene.Â  Even if SCDOT had not installed adequate \r\n  warning signs, then, the jury could have found Brown, in overlooking readily \r\n  apparent hazards in the roadway, had failed to maintain a proper lookout. [15] \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to \r\n  SCDOT, we agree there is more than one reasonable inference regarding whether \r\n  Brown was at fault in the accident.Â  We therefore hold that, under South Carolina \r\n  Code section 15-78-100(c), the trial court should have given the jury the opportunity \r\n  to apportion fault among all tortfeasors, including Brown.\r\n3.Â  It appears from SCDOTâ€™s brief that the question \r\n  of whether the trial court erred in refusing to charge the defense of unavoidable \r\n  accident becomes an issue in this appeal only if the directed verdict in favor \r\n  of Brown is affirmed. [16] Â  \r\n  We have reversed the directed verdict; therefore, we do not reach the issue \r\n  of whether the trial court should have charged the defense of unavoidable accident. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, AND REVERSED IN PART, AND \r\n  REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Section 15-78-100(c) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act provides \r\n    that â€œ[i]n all actions brought pursuant to this chapter when an alleged joint \r\n    tortfeasor is named as party defendant in addition to the governmental entity, \r\n    the trier of fact must return a special verdict specifying the proportion \r\n    of monetary liability of each defendant against whom liability is determined.â€Â  \r\n    S.C.

Blanchard, alleging he committed medical malpractice in negligently \r\n  failing to advise her husband, Robert (â€œMr. Fullerâ€), of the adverse results \r\n  of a cancer screening test.Â  Dr. Blanchard moved for summary judgment on his \r\n  defenses that the action was barred as a matter of law by the exclusive remedy \r\n  provision of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and because he owed \r\n  no duty of care to Mr. Fuller.Â  The circuit court granted Mrs. Fullerâ€™s cross-motion \r\n  for summary judgment on the two defenses, and Dr. Blanchard appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nMr. Fuller worked as a chemical \r\n  engineer at Westinghouse.Â  In 1996, Westinghouse offered a Prostate Specific \r\n  Antigen (PSA) test to its male employees as part of the blood work done for \r\n  their required annual physical examinations.Â  The usual procedure was for the \r\n  employee to have blood drawn for lab testing and then report to the physician \r\n  for a physical examination a week to ten days later.Â  At that time, the physician \r\n  would review the test results, report them to the employee, and give the employee \r\n  a copy.Â  An abnormal PSA result indicated that the patientâ€™s prostate gland \r\n  could be diseased and that the patient needed to seek further treatment.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nPursuant to an agreement between Westinghouse \r\n  and Doctors Care, Dr. Blanchard, an employee of Doctors Care, performed physical \r\n  examinations for the employees of Westinghouse and was on site twice a week \r\n  to perform these services for a total of about four hours each week.Â  Dr. Blanchard \r\n  and a nurse, who was a full-time Westinghouse employee, received all blood test \r\n  results and reviewed them before Dr. Blanchard conducted the physical examinations.Â  \r\n  Dr. Blanchardâ€™s established procedure was to report to each employee any abnormal \r\n  test results, give the employee one copy of the lab work, and recommend that \r\n  the employee see his family physician.Â  \r\nWestinghouse employees saw Dr. Blanchard \r\n  only for routine employment physicals or for examination prior to returning \r\n  to work after surgery or illness.Â  On average, he saw between ten and fifteen \r\n  employees during each session at Westinghouse.Â  Dr. Blanchard was paid by Doctors \r\n  Care and did not receive any payment for his services from Westinghouse.Â  \r\nIn October 1996, Mr. Fullerâ€™s blood was \r\n  drawn and sent for lab testing, which included a PSA test.Â  The report showed \r\n  a 5.0 PSA level.Â  Dr. Blanchard stated that upon seeing a PSA level of 5.0 he \r\n  routinely would have recommended to the employee that he consult his personal \r\n  physician.Â  He could not, however, specifically recall whether he informed Mr. \r\n  Fuller of the elevated PSA level or advised him to see his family physician.Â  \r\n  There was no notation in the medical chart completed by Dr. Blanchard that Mr. \r\n  Fuller was ever informed of the elevated PSA level.\r\nIn August 1997, Mr. Fuller again had a \r\n  PSA test performed as part of his annual physical at Westinghouse.Â  This time \r\n  Mr. Fullerâ€™s PSA level was more than double its previous reading.Â  Dr. Blanchard \r\n  advised Mr. Fuller that he should see his family physician.Â  Mr. Fuller sought \r\n  further treatment.Â  In September 1997, his urologist diagnosed him with prostate \r\n  cancer and informed him that his treatment options were limited because of the \r\n  progression of the cancer.Â  Mr. Fuller died from prostate cancer on November \r\n  25, 1998.Â  \r\nMrs. Fuller brought this action against Dr. Blanchard \r\n  alleging medical negligence in the wrongful death of her husband.Â  Dr. Blanchard \r\n  answered and asserted as affirmative defenses that the action was barred as \r\n  a matter of law because (1) the court did not have jurisdiction as the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Act was the exclusive remedy, and (2) he was acting as a company \r\n  physician and therefore did not have a physician-patient relationship with Mr. \r\n  Fuller giving rise to a duty of care.Â  Mrs. Fuller and Dr. Blanchard filed cross-motions \r\n  for summary judgment.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment to Mrs. \r\n  Fuller on Dr. Blanchardâ€™s two defenses.Â  The court found Dr. Blanchard was an \r\n  independent contractor, not an employee of Westinghouse, and that Mr. Fullerâ€™s \r\n  death was not a work-related injury.Â  The court additionally found that Dr. \r\n  Blanchard owed a duty of care, although limited, to Mr. Fuller.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nDr. Blanchard first contends the circuit court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment to Mrs. Fuller on his defense that he was \r\n  immune from suit because any medical malpractice claim was barred as a matter \r\n  of law by the exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is the exclusive \r\n  remedy against an employer for an employeeâ€™s work-related accident or injury. \r\n  [2] Â  The Actâ€™s exclusivity provision provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\nThe rights and remedies granted by this Title to an employee \r\n  when he and his employer have accepted the provisions of this Title, respectively, \r\n  to pay and accept compensation on account of personal injury or death by accident, \r\n  shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal \r\n  representative, parents, dependents or next of kin as against his employer, \r\n  at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury, loss of service or death. [3] \r\n\r\nâ€œThe exclusive remedy doctrine was enacted to balance \r\n  the relative ease with which the employee can recover under the Act:Â  the employee \r\n  gets swift, sure compensation, and the employer receives immunity from tort \r\n  actions by the employee.â€ [4] Â Â  \r\n\r\nFurther, as a general rule, this â€œimmunity is conferred \r\n  not only on the direct employer, but also on co-employees.â€ \r\n  [5] Â  Thus, an employee negligently injured by a co-employee conducting \r\n  the employerâ€™s business may not hold the co-employee personally liable in tort, \r\n  but must instead rely upon the remedies provided by the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act. [6] Â  \r\nSuch immunity does not extend, however, to third-party \r\n  tortfeasors who injure an employee acting within the course and scope of his \r\n  employment; in such cases, the employee may file a claim for workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  benefits for the injury and may also bring an action against the third party.Â  \r\n  Any recovery against the third party, however, is subject to subrogation. [7] Â  \r\nâ€œ[I]n general, treating physicians, as third parties \r\n  to the employer-employee relationship, do not fall within the immunity provisions \r\n  of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and are subject to suit.â€ \r\n  [8]   \r\nIn the case before us, the circuit court found \r\n  Dr. Blanchard was not entitled to blanket immunity under the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act because he provided his services to Westinghouse as an independent contractor, \r\n  not its employee; further, even if Dr. Blanchard were a co-employee, Mr. Fullerâ€™s \r\n  death from cancer was not work-related.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Dr. Blanchard contends the circuit court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment to Mrs. Fuller on his defense that her claim \r\n  was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  \r\n  Dr. Blanchard asserts that he and Mr. Fuller were co-employees and that Mr. \r\n  Fullerâ€™s death was a work-related injury.Â  \r\nâ€œWhether or not an employer-employee relationship \r\n  exists is aÂ  jurisdictional question.â€ \r\n  [9] Â  When the issue on appeal involves jurisdiction, we can take our own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  [10] Â  \r\nâ€œWhether a worker is an employee or independent \r\n  contractor is a fact-specific matter resolved by applying certain established \r\n  principles.â€ [11] Â  Our supreme \r\n  court has stated the general test concerns the extent of the employerâ€™s right \r\n  of control:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe general test applied is that of control by the employer.Â  \r\n  It is not the actual control then exercised, but whether there exists the right \r\n  and authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking, as to \r\n  the manner or means of its accomplishment.â€ [12] \r\n\r\nâ€œThere are four elements which determine the right \r\n  of control:Â  1) direct evidence of the right or exercise of control; 2) furnishing \r\n  of equipment;Â  3) right to fire; and 4) method of payment.â€ \r\n  [13] \r\nWe agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that Dr. Blanchard provided services to Westinghouse not as its employee, but \r\n  as an independent contractor.Â  As to the evidence of the right of control and \r\n  the furnishing of equipment, although Westinghouse apparently established Dr. \r\n  Blanchard would be available on its premises four hours per week and provided \r\n  a Westinghouse employee to assist as his nurse, the only evidence in the record \r\n  indicates that Dr. Blanchard scheduled employee visits, conducted a personal \r\n  review of the test results, and made his recommendations without any direct \r\n  supervision or instruction from Westinghouse, as such reviews came within the \r\n  scope of his own professional expertise.Â  Regarding the right to fire and the \r\n  method of payment, as noted by the circuit court, Dr. Blanchard was not employed \r\n  directly by Westinghouse; rather, he was on site four hours a week to provide \r\n  services pursuant to a contractual agreement Westinghouse had with Doctors Care.Â  \r\n  It was undisputed that Dr. Blanchard was not on Westinghouseâ€™s payroll and received \r\n  no compensation whatsoever from Westinghouse.Â  Rather, he was paid directly \r\n  by Doctors Care for his professional services.Â  Dr. Blanchard testified he was \r\n  not involved in negotiating the contract Doctors Care had with Westinghouse \r\n  and he was unaware of its terms.Â  Finally, there is no evidence in the record \r\n  that Westinghouse could have fired Dr. Blanchard.Â  \r\nIn Garcia v. Iserson, relied upon by Dr. \r\n  Blanchard, the Court of Appeals of New York held â€œthat the claim of an employee \r\n  for alleged malpractice [by] a physician whose professional services were made \r\n  available to the employee at the employerâ€™s expense and on its premises [fell] \r\n  within the scope of the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Law.â€ [14] Â  In Garcia, a physician \r\n  provided by the employer, Imperial Paper Box Corp., on the employerâ€™s premises \r\n  allegedly gave an Imperial employee an injection in a negligent manner.Â  The \r\n  court explained its reasoning as follows:Â  â€œThere was here a professional service \r\n  made available by the employer to its employees; the services were not available \r\n  generally to members of the public; [and the] plaintiff obtained the services \r\n  not as a member of the public but only in consequence of his employment.â€ [15] Â  The court concluded the plaintiffâ€™s exclusive remedy was \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation rather than a common-law action for malpractice because \r\n  the injury arose out of and in the course of the plaintiffâ€™s employment as a \r\n  result of the alleged negligence of another in the same \r\n  employ. [16] Â  \r\nWe find Garcia distinguishable in a major \r\n  respect - in Garcia it was undisputed that the physician was a co-employee \r\n  of the injured worker.Â  The court noted that the doctor was employed by Imperial \r\n  at a weekly salary to give medical care to its employees, that â€œ[t]he usual \r\n  payroll deductions were made from the doctorâ€™s salary check and he was covered \r\n  under Imperialâ€™s medical plan and its workmenâ€™s compensation insurance policy.â€ [17] Â Â Â  \r\nThe other cases cited by Dr. Blanchard are also \r\n  distinguishable on this basis. [18] Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court did not \r\n  err in finding Dr. Blanchard was an independent contractor and not a co-employee \r\n  of Mr. Fuller; therefore, Mrs. Fullerâ€™s malpractice claim is not barred by the \r\n  exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. \r\n  [19] Â  \r\nII.\r\nDr. Blanchard additionally asserts the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment to Mrs. Fuller on his defense that \r\n  he owed no duty of care to Mr. Fuller as a matter of law because there never \r\n  was a physician-patient relationship.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court ruled Dr. Blanchard â€œowe[d] a \r\n  duty of care, albeit limited,â€ to Mr. Fuller.Â  The court concluded Mrs. Fuller \r\n  was â€œentitled to go forward . . . [on] allegations that the defendant failed \r\n  to timely advise an employee of abnormal medical findings and failed to recommend \r\n  follow-up with another physician for testing, diagnosis or treatment.â€Â  The \r\n  court noted that â€œ[t]he parties stipulated that [Mrs. Fuller] will be able to \r\n  produce expert testimony that the defendant deviated from standard medical care.â€Â  \r\n\r\nWe find there is evidence to support the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling since there was an established protocol, which Dr. Blanchard \r\n  claimed to follow, which required him to inform employees of any adverse test \r\n  results and to advise them to seek additional medical treatment as necessary.Â  \r\n  In this case, irrespective of Dr. Blanchardâ€™s status as either a company doctor \r\n  or an independent contractor, Dr. Blanchard failed to inform Mr. Fuller of the \r\n  adverse results of a prostate cancer screening test and to advise him to seek \r\n  follow-up care from another physician.Â  Due to this omission, Mr. Fullerâ€™s PSA \r\n  level had doubled by the time the test was again performed, and Mr. Fuller died \r\n  from prostate cancer.Â  \r\nWe note that, ordinarily, â€œ[t]he existence of a \r\n  physician-patient relationship is a question of fact for the jury.â€ \r\n  [20] Â  Dr. Blanchard does not contend that questions of fact remain in this \r\n  case, so we do not consider that point here.Â  Rather, Dr. Blanchardâ€™s only contention \r\n  is that, based on the facts of this case as they are, the court committed an \r\n  error of law in granting summary judgment to Mrs. Fuller; he maintains his defense \r\n  should have prevailed.Â  Consequently, we find no basis on which to disturb the \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling. [21] \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.Â  KITTREDGE, J., concurs in a separate \r\n  opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  I concur.Â  However, I write \r\n  separately to express my concern with the jurisdiction of this court to entertain \r\n  this appeal.Â  In my judgment, Appellantâ€™s challenge on appeal is limited to \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s failure to grant him summary judgment. [22] Â  The refusal to grant summary judgment \r\n  is not appealable.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, 354 S.C. 161, \r\n  580 S.E.2d 440 (2003); Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 \r\n  (1994).\r\nPursuant to cross-motions for summary \r\n  judgment, the circuit court granted Respondentâ€™sÂ  motion.Â  On appeal, Appellant \r\n  claims error solely on the basis that the underlying action was barred as a \r\n  matter of law by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act and because he owed no duty of care to Respondentâ€™s husband.Â  It is significant \r\n  to note that these issues, as recognized by the majority, are predominantly \r\n  fact-driven.Â  See Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2002) (â€œWhether a worker is an employee or independent \r\n  contractor is a fact-specific matter resolved by applying certain established \r\n  principles.â€); Tumblin v. Ball-Incon Glass Packaging Corp.,Â  324 S.C. \r\n  359, 365, 478 S.E.2d 81, 85 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œThe existence of a physician-patient \r\n  relationship is a question of fact for the jury.â€).Â  The final brief and reply \r\n  brief of Appellant make no claim that there exists a genuine issue as to any \r\n  material fact.Â  As the majority correctly concludes, Appellant â€œdoes not contend \r\n  that questions of fact remain in this case.â€Â  In reaching the merits of this \r\n  appeal, the majority is essentially rehearing the cross-motions for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  I believe we have neither the authority to reconsider the denial \r\n  of Appellantâ€™s summary judgment motion nor the authority to grant him judgment \r\n  as a matter of law on the fact-specific issues presented. \r\nThus, the issue as presented \r\n  by Appellant is the functional equivalent of an appeal of the refusal to grant \r\n  summary judgment.Â  I would decline to address the merits and dismiss the appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Strickland v.

Ball-Incon Glass \r\n    Packaging Corp., 324 S.C. 359, 365, 478 S.E.2d 81, 85 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n    In Tumblin we observed that a physician who has been retained by a \r\n    third party to conduct an examination normally is not subject to a malpractice \r\n    claim by the individual examined unless the physician offered or intended \r\n    to treat, care for, or otherwise benefit the individual or injured the individual \r\n    in the course of the examination.Â  Id. at 365-66, 478 S.E.2d at 85.Â  \r\n    In the current appeal, Dr. Blanchard did not perform the screening tests merely \r\n    for the benefit of Westinghouse, the employer.Â  Rather, Dr. Blanchard acknowledged \r\n    that his practice was to inform the Westinghouse employees of any adverse \r\n    results from the cancer-screening tests and to advise them of the need to \r\n    seek further evaluation when necessary.Â  We believe this constitutes a benefit \r\n    to the employee and care that would fall within the exceptions delineated \r\n    in Tumblin.Â  \r\n  We note that in Tumblin, we held that \r\n    a physician fulfilled any responsibility he had to an employee by informing \r\n    her of an elevated blood pressure reading and suggesting that she follow up \r\n    with her private doctor.Â  Id. at 367, 478 S.E.2d at 86.Â  In contrast, \r\n    in the case before us Dr. Blanchard allegedly failed to inform Mr. Fuller \r\n    of the adverse results of a cancer-screening test and to advise him to seek \r\n    further treatment as necessary.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    \r\n [21] This case concerned \r\n    cross-motions for summary judgment regarding two of Dr. Blanchardâ€™s defenses; \r\n    the circuit court simultaneously granted Mrs. Fullerâ€™s motion for summary \r\n    judgment and denied Dr. Blanchardâ€™s motion.Â  On appeal, the parties have blurred \r\n    the distinction between the two motions.Â  Because the granting of a \r\n    motion for summary judgment is appealable while the denial of a motion \r\n    for summary judgment is not, we are addressing Dr. Blanchardâ€™s arguments to \r\n    the extent he appears to challenge the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment \r\n    to Mrs. Fuller as an error of law based on the facts of the case, although, \r\n    as stated, there has been an overlapping of these issues due to the procedural \r\n    posture of the case.Â  To the extent Dr. Blanchard appears to argue the court \r\n    should have granted his motion for summary judgment, the denial of summary \r\n    judgment is not properly before us and we do not address it.Â  See Silverman \r\n    v. Campbell, 326 S.C. 208, 486 S.E.2d 1 (1997) (reiterating that the denial \r\n    of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable, even after final judgment); \r\n    Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994) (stating the \r\n    denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable).Â  Neither party \r\n    makes this distinction in the briefs and Mrs. Fuller does not assert that \r\n    Dr. Blanchard is only arguing about the denial of his own motion for summary \r\n    judgment, so we have addressed the issues in the manner outlined above.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [22]  This is not an appeal from a merits hearing.Â  The appeal comes to \r\n    us in the posture of a grant of summary judgment.Â  While Appellantâ€™s final \r\n    brief and reply brief purport to appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s grant of \r\n    summary judgment in favor of Respondent, his argument is focused solely on \r\n    the lower courtâ€™s failure to grant him judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3764","title":"Hawkins v.

[1] \r\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn July 24, 1997, Hawkinsâ€™ business, Servicemaster \r\n  of Greenville, was flooded during a heavy rainfall, causing substantial damage \r\n  to the business and surrounding property.Â  Hawkins blamed the City for the damage, \r\n  arguing the flooding was caused by the Cityâ€™s neglect in designing and maintaining \r\n  its stormwater drainage system.Â  Accordingly, he brought the present action \r\n  asserting various causes of action stemming from the Cityâ€™s alleged acts and \r\n  failures to act.\r\nI.Â  The Servicemaster Property and \r\n  Surrounding Drainage System\r\nThe Servicemaster property is located in a low-lying \r\n  area on the east side of Greenville.Â  This part of Greenville has been heavily \r\n  developed with retail businesses and other large commercial developments.\r\nThe immediate area surrounding the Servicemaster \r\n  property forms a 3.24-square-mile stormwater basin.Â  Rainwater falling into \r\n  the basin drains downhill into nearby Laurel Creek.Â  Over the years, the City \r\n  and private developers made several improvements to the drainage system in the \r\n  basin.Â  When Hawkins moved Servicemaster to its Haywood Road location, drainage \r\n  around the property was handled primarily by two ninety-six-inch pipes installed \r\n  in Laurel Creek to expand the creekâ€™s ability to effectively handle runoff in \r\n  the area.Â  After a severe storm in 1991 caused flooding in the area, the City \r\n  installed an additional large, elliptical arched pipe in Laurel Creek to further \r\n  increase the creekâ€™s stormwater capacity.Â  In early July 1997, the City installed \r\n  â€œriprapâ€ along the banks of the creek to stem erosion that had occurred. \r\n  [2] \r\nII.Â  The 1991 Flood, Lawsuit and \r\n  Settlement\r\nA heavy rainstorm in July 1991 caused \r\n  the Servicemaster property and surrounding area to flood.Â  The Servicemaster \r\n  property suffered substantial damage when the excess runoff flooded into the \r\n  building, bringing mud and other debris.Â  As in the present case, Hawkins brought \r\n  suit against the City, claiming its actions caused the flooding.Â  Hawkins specifically \r\n  alleged the City was negligent â€œin failing to designâ€ and â€œmaintain a reasonably \r\n  adequate surface water drainage systemâ€ and â€œin failing to properly supervise \r\n  the surface water drainage system to ensure adequate flow of water during periods \r\n  of inc[l]ement weather.â€\r\nThe case was settled in 1994.Â  The City \r\n  paid Hawkins $4,000 in exchange for a â€œfull, complete and final release of all \r\n  damages arising out of the design, construction, maintenance, and operation \r\n  of the water drainage system on or adjacent to Bryland [sic] Drive.â€Â  This release \r\n  was executed in March 1994.Â  It provides:\r\n\r\n[Servicemaster] does hereby release, \r\n  relieve and forever acquit the City of Greenville, South Carolina, a municipal \r\n  corporation, their agents, employees, officers, successors, and assigns from \r\n  any and all liability arising out of or in any way connected with the water \r\n  and mud damage to [Hawkinsâ€™] place of business located at 1 Byrdland Drive which \r\n  occurred on or about July 30, 1991 and it is the intention in executing this \r\n  Release to forever discharge the City of Greenville from any and all claims, \r\n  demands, actions or causes of action which may exist, known or unknown, of any \r\n  and all damages, past, present and future, in any way connected with or arising \r\n  out of the aforesaid damages.\r\n. . . .\r\nIt is acknowledged and understood \r\n  that this is a full, complete and final release of all damages arising out of \r\n  the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of the water drainage system \r\n  on or adjacent to Bryland [sic] Drive, that no future or further payments will \r\n  be paid as a result thereof and that the persons and corporations in whose favor \r\n  this Release runs are herewith fully finally and forever discharged from any \r\n  and all liability with respect to the aforementioned property. \r\n\r\nIII.Â  The 1997 Flood and the Present \r\n  ActionÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn July 24, 1997, a record amount of rain fell \r\n  in and around Greenville in a short period of time. [3] Â  Stormwater draining into Laurel \r\n  Creek overwhelmed the creekâ€™s capacity, causing water to flood onto the Servicemaster \r\n  property and several nearby businesses.\r\nIn July 1999, Hawkins brought the present action \r\n  against the City, alleging causes of action for: (1) inverse condemnation, (2) \r\n  negligence in the Cityâ€™s design and maintenance of its stormwater drainage system, \r\n  (3) violation of South Carolina Code section 5-31-450, (4) trespass, (5) conversion, \r\n  and (6) nuisance.Â  Finding no genuine issue of material fact with respect to \r\n  any of these claims, the trial court granted the Cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; accord Trivelas v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 130, 558 S.E.2d 271, 273 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001); Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501 S.E.2d 746, \r\n  749 (Ct.

Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. \r\n  418, 392 S.E.2d 460 (1990)).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of \r\n  fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Lanham \r\n  v.

Lexington County Recreation \r\n  Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  â€œSummary judgment \r\n  is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable \r\n  to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Lanham, 349 S.C. at 362, 563 \r\n  S.E.2d at 333 (citing Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 688 (2000)).Â  \r\nâ€œAll ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising \r\n  from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party.â€Â  \r\n  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002) \r\n  (citing Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  413 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  â€œEven when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, \r\n  but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary \r\n  judgment should be denied.â€Â  Id. at 173-74, 561 S.E.2d at 656.Â  â€œBecause \r\n  it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked so no \r\n  person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.â€Â  \r\n  Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 138, 542 S.E.2d 743, 747 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (citing Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (1999)).Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court: Summary \r\n  judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \r\n  that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP; accord Baughman, 306 S.C. at 114-15, 410 S.E.2d at 545; \r\n  Murray, 344 S.C. at 138, 542 S.E.2d at 747 (citing Brockbank, \r\n  341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688; Wells, 331 S.C. at 301, 501 S.E.2d at 749). \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHawkins contends genuine issues of fact \r\n  exist for each of his claims that should have compelled the trial court to deny \r\n  the Cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Inverse Condemnation\r\nHawkins first argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to the City on his inverse condemnation claim, \r\n  contending he was deprived of his full rights to the Servicemaster property \r\n  without just compensation as a result of the Cityâ€™s design and maintenance of \r\n  the drainage system.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn action for inverse condemnation is appropriate where \r\n  the government takes private property for public use.Â  Quality Towing Inc. \r\n  v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 38, 530 S.E.2d 369, 373 (2000).Â  Inverse \r\n  condemnation is a cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover \r\n  the value of property which has been taken in fact by the governmental defendant, \r\n  even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted \r\n  by the taking agency.Â  Horry County v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 344 S.C. 493, \r\n  498, 544 S.E.2d 637, 640 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  While the typical taking occurs when \r\n  the government acts to condemn property in the exercise of its power of eminent \r\n  domain, the entire doctrine of inverse condemnation is predicated on the proposition \r\n  that a taking may occur without such formal proceedings.Â  Horry County, \r\n  344 S.C. at 498, 544 S.E.2d at 640.Â  â€œThe term â€˜inverse condemnationâ€™ describes \r\n  an action grounded, not on statutory condemnation power, but on the constitutional \r\n  proscription against the taking or damaging of property for public use without \r\n  just compensation.â€Â  Vicks v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 347 S.C. \r\n  470, 480, 556 S.E.2d 693, 698 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œOne basic difference between \r\n  condemnation and inverse condemnation is that in condemnation proceedings, the \r\n  governmental entity is the moving party, whereas, in inverse condemnation, the \r\n  property owner is the moving party.â€Â  South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t \r\n  v. Moody, 267 S.C. 130, 136, 226 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1976) (quoting 27 Am.Jur.2d \r\n  Eminent Domain Â§ 829 (1996)).Â  The action is not based on tort, but on \r\n  the constitutional prohibition of the taking of property without compensation.Â  \r\n  Horry County, 344 S.C. at 498, 544 S.E.2d at 640.\r\nAn inverse condemnation occurs when a \r\n  government agency commits a taking of private property without exercising its \r\n  formal powers of eminent domain.Â  To establish an inverse condemnation, a plaintiff \r\n  must show: â€œ(1) an affirmative, positive, aggressive act on the part of the \r\n  governmental agency; (2) a taking; (3) the taking is for a public use; and (4) \r\n  the taking has some degree of permanence.â€ Marietta Garage, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 352 S.C. 95, 101, 572 S.E.2d 306, 308 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002); Gray v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., \r\n  311 S.C. 144, 149, 427 S.E.2d 899, 902 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nIn the present case, Hawkins has failed \r\n  to allege any affirmative acts by the City which damaged the Servicemaster property \r\n  or otherwise diminished his rights in the property.Â  Most of the Cityâ€™s â€œactsâ€ \r\n  he avers support his inverse condemnation claim are merely failures to act. \r\n  Â Specifically, Hawkins asserts the City improperly allowed the development of \r\n  neighboring parcels of commercial property which altered the elevation of the \r\n  area and added strain to the Laurel Creek drainage pipes beyond their capacity \r\n  and then failed to replace these pipes.Â  The South Carolina cases addressing \r\n  inverse condemnation are uniform in requiring that the claim be proved by â€œaffirmative, \r\n  positive, aggressiveâ€ acts by the governmental agency. Allegations of mere failure \r\n  to act are insufficient.Â  See, e.g., Berryâ€™s On Main, Inc. v. City \r\n  of Columbia, 277 S.C. 14, 16, 281 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1981) (holding that proof \r\n  of inverse condemnation requires that â€œthere must be an affirmative, positive, \r\n  aggressive act on the part of the governmental agencyâ€); Gray v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. 144, 149, 427 S.E.2d 899, \r\n  902 (Ct. App. 1993) (listing as an element of inverse condemnation the requirement \r\n  that there be â€œan affirmative, positive, aggressive act on the part of the governmental \r\n  agencyâ€).\r\nThe only affirmative acts Hawkins cites as forming \r\n  the basis of his inverse condemnation claim are the replacement of the double-box \r\n  culvert with the large arched pipe in Laurel Creek in 1994 and the installation \r\n  of the riprap material along the banks of the creek in 1997.Â  The record contains \r\n  no evidence that either of these acts caused the flooding of the Servicemaster \r\n  property in 1997.Â  Hawkinsâ€™ own expert testified that the installation of the \r\n  large arched pipe likely improved the drainage situation in the stormwater basin.Â  \r\n  Regarding the effect of the riprap material on drainage in the Laurel Creek \r\n  basin, experts for both the City and Hawkins either offered no opinion on the \r\n  impact of the riprap or opined that it was impossible to determine whether installing \r\n  the riprap negatively or positively affected drainage.\r\nBased on the lack of any evidence showing an affirmative, \r\n  positive, aggressive act on the part of the City which would tend to prove the \r\n  Cityâ€™s actions caused or precipitated the flooding of the Servicemaster property, \r\n  we are compelled to affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on Hawkinsâ€™ \r\n  inverse condemnation claim.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Negligence\r\nHawkins argues the trial court erred in \r\n  finding his negligence claim against the City was barred under the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to 15-78-200 (Supp. 2003).Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort claims \r\n  against governmental entities.Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 203, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  It is the exclusive civil remedy available \r\n  for any tort committed by a governmental entity or its employees or agents.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. 2003); Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, \r\n  Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 215, 544 S.E.2d 38, 49 (Ct. App. 2001); Wells v. \r\n  City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 302, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n  The Tort Claims Act provides that the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, \r\n  and other governmental entities are â€œliable for their torts in the same manner \r\n  and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,â€ subject \r\n  to certain limitations and exemptions provided in the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  15-78-40 (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œGovernmental entityâ€ is defined by the act as â€œthe \r\n  State and its political subdivisions.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(d) (Supp. \r\n  2002); Flateau, 355 S.C. at 204, 584 S.E.2d at 416.Â  The provisions of \r\n  the Act establishing limitations on and exemptions to the liability of the State, \r\n  its political subdivisions, and employees, while acting within the scope of \r\n  official duty, must be liberally construed in favor of limiting liability of \r\n  the State.Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 15-78-20(f) (Supp. 2003); Steinke v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 396, 520 S.E.2d 142, \r\n  154 (1999); Arthurs v. Aiken County, 338 S.C. 253, 270, 525 S.E.2d 542, \r\n  551 (Ct. App. 1999); Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 331 S.C. 192, 205, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 160, 167 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The governmental entity asserting the \r\n  Act as an affirmative defense bears the burden of establishing a limitation \r\n  upon liability or an exception to the waiver of immunity.Â  Strange v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 430, 445 S.E.2d \r\n  439, 440 (1994); Steinke, 336 S.C. at 393, 520 S.E.2d at 152; Arthurs, \r\n  338 S.C. at 270, 525 S.E.2d at 551.Â  The Act does not create a new substantive \r\n  cause of action against a governmental entity.Â  Moore v. Florence Sch. Dist. \r\n  No. 1, 314 S.C. 335, 339, 444 S.E.2d 498, 500 (1994); Bayle v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 121, 542 S.E.2d 736, 739 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).Â  The Plaintiff must present evidence of the governmental entityâ€™s duty \r\n  to act in order to recover under the Act.Â  Arthurs, 338 S.C. at 270, \r\n  525 S.E.2d at 551.Â  The Tort Claims Act expressly preserves all existing common \r\n  law immunities.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 277, 246, 553 S.E.2d 496, \r\n  507 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The Tort Claims Act is a limited waiver of governmental \r\n  immunity.Â  Arthurs, 338 S.C. at 270, 525 S.E.2d at 551.Â  Section 15-78-60 \r\n  sets out thirty-seven â€œexceptionsâ€ to this waiver of sovereign immunity.Â  These \r\n  exceptions significantly limit the tort liability of government entities.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSeveral of these exceptions bear directly upon \r\n  the alleged acts and failures to act by the City with respect to the municipal \r\n  drainage system.Â  Specifically, under section 15-78-60, the City is not liable \r\n  for a loss resulting from: (1) â€œlegislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action \r\n  or inactionâ€; (2) â€œadministrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, \r\n  or quasi-judicial natureâ€; (3) â€œadoption, enforcement, or compliance with any \r\n  law or failure to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, \r\n  but not limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, \r\n  or written policiesâ€; (4) â€œthe exercise of discretion or judgment by the governmental \r\n  entity or employee or the performance or failure to perform any act or service \r\n  which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental entity or employeeâ€; \r\n  or (5) â€œregulatory inspection powers or functions, including failure to make \r\n  an inspection, or making an inadequate or negligent inspection, of any property \r\n  to determine whether the property complies with or violates any law, regulation, \r\n  code, or ordinance or contains a hazard to health or safety.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-60 (1), (2), (4), (5), and (13) (Supp. 2003).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFor each of these specific provisions, \r\n  the determination of immunity from tort liability turns on the question of whether \r\n  the acts in question were discretionary rather than ministerial.Â  A finding \r\n  of immunity under the Act â€œis contingent on proof the government entity, faced \r\n  with alternatives, actually weighed competing considerations and made a conscious \r\n  choice using accepted professional standards.â€ Wooten ex rel. Wooten v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999).Â  \r\n  â€œThe governmental entity bears the burden of establishing discretionary immunity \r\n  as an affirmative defense.â€Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 \r\n  S.C. 416, 428, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002).\r\nAlthough our courts have not applied the \r\n  Tort Claims Act to facts similar to those of the present case, the Supreme Court \r\n  of Texas has held that municipalities are not liable for the design and planning \r\n  of their sewage and drainage systems because these acts are considered quasi-judicial, \r\n  discretionary functions for which a government entity is not liable.Â  City \r\n  of Tyler v. Likes, 962 S.W.2d 489, 501 (Tex. 1997).Â  The court in City \r\n  of Tyler opined:\r\n\r\nThe duties of the municipal authorities \r\n  in adopting a general plan of drainage, and determining when and where sewers \r\n  shall be built, of what size and at what level, are of a quasi judicial nature, \r\n  involving the exercise of deliberate judgment and large discretion, and depending \r\n  upon considerations affecting the public health and general convenience throughout \r\n  an extensive territory; and the exercise of such judgment and discretion in \r\n  the selection and adoption of a general plan or system of drainage is not subject \r\n  to revision by a court or jury in a private action for not sufficiently draining \r\n  a particular lot of land.\r\n\r\nId.Â  We find a comparable degree of discretion \r\n  was granted to the City in the present case to exercise the measured policy \r\n  judgments required to build and maintain an adequate municipal sewer and drainage \r\n  system in Greenville. Accordingly, the City is immune from liability for negligence \r\n  claims arising out of the design and maintenance of the drainage system in the \r\n  Laurel Creek Basin.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Liability Under South Carolina Code Section \r\n  5-31-450\r\nHawkins next appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of \r\n  summary judgment as to his claim under South Carolina Code section 5-31-450.Â  \r\n  We find no error with the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nSection 5-31-450 mandates: \r\n\r\nWhenever, within the boundaries \r\n  of any municipality, it shall be necessary or desirable to carry off the surface \r\n  water from any street, alley or other public thoroughfare along such thoroughfare \r\n  rather than over private lands adjacent to or adjoining such thoroughfare, such \r\n  municipality shall, upon demand from the owner of such private lands, provide \r\n  sufficient drainage for such water through open or covered drains, except when \r\n  the formation of the street renders it impracticable, along or under such streets, \r\n  alleys or other thoroughfare in such manner as to prevent the passage of such \r\n  water over such private lands or property.Â  But if such drains cannot be had \r\n  along or under such streets, alleys or other thoroughfare, the municipal authorities \r\n  may obtain, under proper proceedings for condemnation on payment of damages \r\n  to the landowner, a right of way through the lands of such landowner for the \r\n  necessary drains for such drainage.Â  If any municipal corporation in this State \r\n  shall fail or refuse to carry out the provisions of this section, any person \r\n  injured thereby may have and maintain an action against such municipality for \r\n  the actual damages sustained by such person.\r\n\r\nApplying this statute, our courts have \r\n  held that liability does not obtain under section 5-31-450 absent some affirmative \r\n  act by the municipality which alters the course or increases the amount of stormwater \r\n  runoff onto private property.Â  See Brown v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville \r\n  County, 251 S.C. 220, 225, 161 S.E.2d 815, 817 (1968) (holding that unless \r\n  the landowner pleads and proves an overt act against the municipality proximately \r\n  causing the damages complained of, there is no cause of action under the statute).Â  \r\n  â€œThe statute does not purport to make the municipality an insurer of the landowner \r\n  against damage from surface water; it is only for such damage as results from \r\n  the municipalityâ€™s works that he may recover.Â  By the same token, a municipality \r\n  may not absolve itself from liability by diverting the surface water from its \r\n  streets into a natural watercourse too small to carry it off.â€Â  Hall v. City \r\n  of Greenville, 227 S.C. 375, 386, 88 S.E.2d 246, 251 (1955).Â  â€œThe statute \r\n  does not make the municipality an insurer of the landowner against damage from \r\n  surface water; it is only for such damage as results from the municipalityâ€™s \r\n  works that he may recover.Â  Therefore, unless the landowner pleads and proves \r\n  an overt act against the municipality proximately causing the damages complained \r\n  of, there is no cause of action under the statute.â€Â  Taleff v. City of Greer, \r\n  284 S.C. 510, 512, 327 S.E.2d 363, 364 (Ct. App. 1985) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n  â€œUnder this statute proof of negligence, in the usual sense of the word, in \r\n  the design or construction of the drainage facilities installed by a municipality \r\n  for the purpose of carrying off surface water along a street or other public \r\n  thoroughfare is not an essential ingredient of the cause of action in favor \r\n  of an adjacent landowner whose property has been damaged by surface water cast \r\n  upon it as the result of such construction.â€Â  Hall, 277 S.C. at 386, \r\n  88 S.E.2d at 251.Â  This section apodictically contemplates positive action by \r\n  a municipality to render it liable for damages.Â  Brown, 251 S.C. at 225, \r\n  161 S.E.2d at 817.\r\nHawkins failed to offer proof of any affirmative, \r\n  positive acts which would tend to show the actions of the City caused the flooding \r\n  of the Servicemaster property.Â  We approve the trial courtâ€™s finding that Hawkinsâ€™ \r\n  claim under section 5-31-450 fails.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Trespass\r\nHawkins appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of summary judgment as to his claim for trespass against real property.Â  We \r\n  find no error with the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nâ€œ[T]respass is any intentional invasion \r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s interest in the exclusive possession of his property . . \r\n  . .â€Â  Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 356, 559 S.E.2d \r\n  327, 337 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, \r\n  344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct.

Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 434 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993))).Â  â€œTo constitute actionable trespass, however, there must be an \r\n  affirmative act, invasion of land must be intentional, and harm caused must \r\n  be the direct result of that invasion.â€Â  Snow v. City of Columbia, 305 \r\n  S.C. 544, 553, 409 S.E.2d 797, 802 (Ct. App. 1991); accord Mack v. \r\n  Edens, 320 S.C. 236, 240, 464 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The gist \r\n  of trespass is the injury to possession, and generally either actual or constructive \r\n  possession is sufficient to maintain an action for trespass.Â  Macedonia Baptist \r\n  Church v. City of Columbia, 195 S.C. 59, 71, 10 S.E.2d 350, 355 (1940).\r\nFor a trespass action to lie, â€œthe act must be \r\n  affirmative, the invasion of the land must be intentional, and the harm caused \r\n  by the invasion of the land must be the direct result of that invasion.â€Â  Mack \r\n  v. Edens, 320 S.C. 236, 240, 464 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Hawkins \r\n  argues the same acts that he claims warrant a finding of inverse condemnation \r\n  also compel a finding of civil trespass.Â  Hawkins did not offer proof that any \r\n  action by the City caused the flooding of the Servicemaster property.\r\nHaving failed to show any affirmative \r\n  and intentional act necessary to sustain an action for trespass, we hold the \r\n  trial court properly granted summary judgment.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Conversion\r\nHawkins next argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment on his claim for conversion.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œConversion is the unauthorized assumption \r\n  and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging \r\n  to another, to the alteration of the condition or the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s \r\n  rights.â€Â  Crane v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 313 S.C. 70, 73, 437 \r\n  S.E.2d 50, 52 (1993).Â  â€œConversion may arise by some illegal use or misuse, \r\n  or by illegal detention of anotherâ€™s personal property.â€Â  Regions Bank v. \r\n  Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Conversion \r\n  is a wrongful act which emanates by either a wrongful taking or wrongful detention.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  It is well settled that a conversion action does not lie when alleging \r\n  the exercise of dominion or control over real property.Â  See 18 Am. Jur. \r\n  2d Conversion Â§ 7 (1998) (commenting that â€œan action for conversion ordinarily \r\n  lies only for personal property which is tangible, or at least represented by \r\n  or connected with something tangibleâ€ andÂ  â€œwill not lie for such indefinite, \r\n  intangible, and incorporeal species of property as a . . . leasehold estate \r\n  or interestâ€).Â  Therefore, to the extent Hawkinsâ€™ conversion claim pertains \r\n  to the actions of the City with respect to real property, the claim clearly \r\n  fails as a matter of law.Â  Additionally, Hawkins provided no evidence that the \r\n  City seized, disposed, denied use, or wrongfully took control of any goods or \r\n  personal chattels belonging to him or his business.\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to \r\n  grant summary judgment on Hawkinsâ€™ conversion claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFinding no genuine issue of material fact \r\n  with respect to any of Hawkinsâ€™ causes of action, we conclude summary judgment \r\n  in favor of the City was proper.Â  The judgment of the trial court is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  â€œRiprapâ€ is an industry term for piles of loose stone or angular \r\n    boulders built seaward of the shoreline to prevent erosion by waves or currents. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Testimony was offered at the summary judgment hearing that the National \r\n    Climatic Data Center recorded that 2.51 inches fell in Greenville during a \r\n    one-hour period on July 24, 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3765","title":"InMed v.

(collectively â€œMedQuestâ€) appeal a jury verdict in favor of InMed Diagnostic \r\n  Services, L.L.C. (â€œInMedâ€) under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (â€œUTPAâ€).Â  InMed \r\n  cross-appeals, arguing error in the award of attorney fees and the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  refusal to award treble damages.Â  We reverse the jury verdict.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe State Certification of Need and Health Facility \r\n  Licensure Act (â€œCON Actâ€) [1]  \r\n  governs the acquisition and use of medical equipment such as MRI machines in \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Under the CON Act, a medical provider must obtain a certificate \r\n  of need (â€œCONâ€) from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental \r\n  Control (â€œDHECâ€) before undertaking â€œthe acquisition of medical equipment which \r\n  is to be used for diagnosis or treatment if the total project cost is in excessâ€ \r\n  of $600,000. [2] Â  If the total \r\n  project cost in a given situation falls below the $600,000 threshold, the provider \r\n  may seek a determination from DHEC that the CON Act does not apply. [3] Â  A determination of this kind \r\n  is known as a non-applicability determination (â€œNADâ€).Â  The application \r\n  and review process to obtain a CON is more detailed and time-consuming than \r\n  that to obtain a NAD.\r\nDHEC regulations define â€œtotal project costâ€ as \r\n  â€œthe estimated total capital cost of a project including land cost, construction, \r\n  fixed and moveable equipment, architectâ€™s fee, financing cost, and other capital \r\n  costs properly charged under generally accepted accounting princip[les] as a \r\n  capital cost.â€ [4] Â  Under \r\n  generally accepted accounting principles, assets are recorded at historical \r\n  or invoice cost when they are acquired.\r\nMedQuest, formed in 1994, operates six facilities \r\n  in South Carolina that provide outpatient diagnostic imaging services, including \r\n  MRI services.Â  In 1998, MedQuest began negotiating with Siemens, a supplier \r\n  of MRI machines, for the purchase of new MRI machines. \r\n  [5] Â  Siemens and MedQuest reached an agreement providing that, as \r\n  MedQuest bought machines from Siemens, Siemens would give a major discount on \r\n  every third purchase.Â  MedQuest used two of these heavily discounted \r\n  purchases for its facilities in Columbia and Florence, South Carolina, and applied \r\n  to DHEC for a NAD for these acquisitions. \r\n  [6] Â  DHEC approved MedQuestâ€™s applications in early 1999. \r\nInMed, a competing provider of outpatient diagnostic \r\n  imaging services, was formed in 1998, when its founder, Robert Adams, purchased \r\n  the assets of Image Trust, an MRI provider in Florence and Columbia that had \r\n  ceased operations.Â  Adams subsequently purchased replacement MRI machines \r\n  for both locations and obtained a NAD for the Florence acquisition.\r\nBoth InMed and MedQuest challenged each otherâ€™s \r\n  NAD for their Florence locations.Â  InMed asserted that MedQuest substantially \r\n  understated the cost of its MRI equipment in its application to DHEC for a NAD.Â  \r\n  MedQuest asserted that InMed should have included a trade-in allowance for used \r\n  equipment in the total cost of the project.Â  The appeals went before \r\n  the Administrative Law Judge Division (â€œALJDâ€); however, they were subsequently \r\n  dismissed by agreement between the parties.\r\nSeveral months later, InMed commenced the present \r\n  action by filing a complaint in the Richland County Circuit Court.Â  In \r\n  its amended complaint, InMed alleged that the individual defendants â€œcombined \r\n  and conspired with each other to provide false and fictitious information to \r\n  DHEC concerning MedQuestâ€™s MRI equipment costs for its facilities in Columbia \r\n  and Florence.â€Â  The complaint also alleged unfair trade practices, common \r\n  law unfair competition, interference with prospective contractual relations, \r\n  and civil conspiracy.\r\nÂ MedQuest answered InMedâ€™s complaint, alleging \r\n  several affirmative defenses, including (1) that exclusive jurisdiction lay \r\n  with the ALJD, (2) that InMed had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, \r\n  and (3) that InMedâ€™s cause of action under the UTPA should be dismissed because \r\n  MedQuestâ€™s conduct was controlled by the CON Act and thus was not subject to \r\n  liability under the Act.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn a form order dated December 6, 2001, and again \r\n  in a formal order dated February 20, 2002, the circuit court granted summary \r\n  judgment as to all causes of action against Siemens.Â  The circuit court \r\n  also granted summary judgment in favor of MedQuest as to the civil conspiracy \r\n  and interference with prospective contractual relations claims; however, summary \r\n  judgment was denied as to the UTPA and common law unfair competition claims. \r\n\r\nInMedâ€™s remaining two claims were then tried to \r\n  a jury from December 10-13, 2001.Â  During the course of the trial, InMed \r\n  dropped the common law unfair competition claim, and only the UTPA claim went \r\n  to the jury.Â  The jury returned a verdict for InMed, awarding $2,107,898 \r\n  in damages.\r\nOn December 19, 2001, MedQuest moved for judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative, for a new trial.Â  The \r\n  next day, InMed moved for treble damages and attorney fees.Â  In a form \r\n  order dated January 10, 2002, the circuit court denied both motions, noting \r\n  further that attorney fees would be set following a hearing on the matter.Â  \r\n  On February 4 and 6, 2002, MedQuest and InMed, respectively, appealed the denial \r\n  of their motions.\r\nOn March 28, 2002, the circuit court heard InMedâ€™s \r\n  motion for attorney fees.Â  By form order dated May 2, 2002, the circuit \r\n  court awarded InMed $100,000 in attorney fees.Â  InMed filed a motion \r\n  to alter or amend this ruling, which was denied by form order on May 20, 2002.Â  \r\n  InMed appealed this ruling on May 29, 2002, and MedQuest likewise appealed \r\n  the order awarding attorney fees.Â  \r\nOn appeal, MedQuest argues the UTPA is inapplicable \r\n  to InMedâ€™s lawsuit because the purchase of medical equipment is specifically \r\n  regulated by DHEC.Â  MedQuest also argues that InMedâ€™s abandonment of \r\n  its appeal before the ALJD barred it from seeking relief in the circuit court.Â  \r\n  Finally, MedQuest contends that, even assuming its actions were subject \r\n  to the UTPA, there was no evidence of a UTPA violation.\r\nIn its cross-appeal, InMed argues that the circuit \r\n  court erred by refusing to award treble damages on its cause of action for unfair \r\n  trade practices.Â  InMed further asks that the attorney fees award of \r\n  $100,000 be vacated and the matter remanded to the circuit court for appropriate \r\n  findings as required by the controlling case law. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nMedQuest first argues the UTPA is inapplicable \r\n  to this case because medical equipment purchases are â€œactions or transactions \r\n  permitted under laws administered by any regulatory body or officer acting under \r\n  statutory authority of this state . . . or actions or transactions permitted \r\n  by any other South Carolina law,â€ which are specifically excluded under section \r\n  39-5-40(a). [7] Â  We agree.\r\nThe exemption provided in section 39-5-40(a) \r\n  was first interpreted in State ex rel. McLeod v. Rhoades. [8] Â  In Rhoades, the supreme court reversed \r\n  the overruling of a demurrer to a complaint of â€œâ€˜unfair and deceptive acts or \r\n  practicesâ€™ in connection with the public offering and saleâ€ of securities. [9] Â  Holding securities transactions fell within the exemption \r\n  provided by section 39-5-40, the supreme court adopted what has come to be known \r\n  as the â€œgeneral activityâ€ test and stated:Â  â€œInitially the burden is on the \r\n  party seeking the exemption to demonstrate its applicability.Â  Once the exemption \r\n  is demonstrated, the complainant must then show that the specific act in question \r\n  did not come within the exemption.â€ [10] Â  \r\nSeveral years later, however, in Ward \r\n  v. Dick Dyer &amp; Associates, the supreme court determined the general \r\n  activity test â€œwould not fulfill the intent of the Legislature in prohibiting \r\n  unfair trade practicesâ€ [11]  \r\n  and adopted the reasoning in a decision of a Tennessee appellate court, which \r\n  explained the purposes of a similar exemption as follows:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the exemption is to insure that a business \r\n  is not subjected to a lawsuit under the Act when it does something required \r\n  by law, or does something that would otherwise be a violation of the Act, but \r\n  which is allowed under other statutes or regulations.Â  It is intended to avoid \r\n  conflict between laws, not to exclude from the Actâ€™s coverage every activity \r\n  that is authorized or regulated by another statute or agency.Â  Virtually every \r\n  activity is regulated to some degree.Â  The defendantâ€™s interpretation of the \r\n  exemption would deprive consumers of a meaningful remedy in many situations. [12] \r\n\r\nIn the present case, InMed argues the \r\n  UTPA exemption should not apply to MedQuestâ€™s actions because â€œ[t]he CON Act \r\n  does not allow the provision of deceptive information to DHEC in order to evade \r\n  the requirements of the CON Act.â€Â  We agree, however, with MedQuest that \r\n  this is an unduly narrow interpretation of the law.Â  Whether MedQuest submitted \r\n  accurate information in support of its NAD applications was necessarily for \r\n  DHEC to determine as part of the administrative process in deciding whether \r\n  or not to grant such applications.\r\nThe stated purpose of the CON Act is â€œto promote \r\n  cost containment, prevent unnecessary duplication of health care facilities \r\n  and services, guide the establishment of health facilities and services which \r\n  will best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality services are provided \r\n  in health facilities in [South Carolina].â€ [13] Â  To these ends, the Act designates DHEC as â€œthe sole \r\n  state agency for control and administration of the granting of Certificates \r\n  of Need and licensure of health facilitiesâ€ \r\n  [14]  and expressly requires â€œsubstantive and procedural regulations . . \r\n  . to carry out [DHECâ€™s] licensure and Certificate of Need duties . . . , including \r\n  regulations to deal with competing applications.â€  [15] \r\nIn carrying out the legislative purpose of the \r\n  CON Act, DHEC has adopted Regulation 61-15, entitled â€œCertification of Need \r\n  for Health Facilities and Services.â€ \r\n  [16] Â  This regulation includes specific procedures for requesting exemptions \r\n  from the CON requirements. [17] \r\n  Â  The stated purpose of Regulation 61-15 is virtually identical to the stated \r\n  purpose of the CON Act. [18]  \r\n \r\n\r\nWe agree with MedQuest that the regulatory exemption \r\n  in section 39-5-40(a) is based on the concept that the legislature has determined \r\n  certain matters are appropriate for resolution by administrative agencies with \r\n  particular expertise, rather than by the general jurisdiction of a trial court. [19] Â  This concept is consistent \r\n  with the supreme courtâ€™s reasoning in Ward that the exemption â€œis intended \r\n  to exclude those actions or transactions which are . . . authorized by regulatory \r\n  agencies . . . .â€ [20] Â  \r\nWard concerned the \r\n  failure of an automobile dealership to inform the plaintiffs that a car it sold \r\n  to them had been involved in an accident. [21] Â  In that case, the dealership argued the \r\n  activity in question was regulated by Title 56 of the South Carolina Code, which \r\n  (1) requires automobile dealers to be licensed by the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Highways and Public Transportation; (2) subjects dealers who fail to secure \r\n  a license to criminal liability; (3) provides for denial, suspension, or revocation \r\n  of dealer licenses in certain cases; (4) declares certain unfair methods of \r\n  competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices to be unlawful; and (5) \r\n  allows for a private right of action for certain violations. \r\n  [22] Â  Nowhere, however, as far as we can tell, is there any reference in \r\n  the opinion or in the record to any statute or regulation governing the transaction \r\n  that formed the basis for the complaint, i.e., the sale of the car.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the supreme court did not base its holding on the argument that there was no \r\n  law allowing or authorizing the specific misconduct the defendant was alleged \r\n  to have committed. [23] \r\nIn contrast, the specific transaction at issue \r\n  in the present controversy is MedQuestâ€™s application for a NAD, a process for \r\n  which DHEC has formulated exacting procedural requirements.Â  Whether or not \r\n  MedQuest followed these procedures correctly is uniquely within the competency \r\n  of DHEC, whose involvement in the application process could continue beyond \r\n  granting the approval should it ever become apparent that a violation of the \r\n  CON Act occurred. [24] Â  To allow a jury in the court of common pleas \r\n  to make the determination that MedQuest had submitted misleading information \r\n  in support of its application for a NADâ€”especially after InMed declined to pursue \r\n  its administrative appeal of DHECâ€™s approval of the applicationâ€”would undermine \r\n  the purpose of the exemption in section 39-5-40(a), even as that section has \r\n  been narrowly interpreted in Ward, of â€œexclud[ing] those actions or transactions \r\n  which are allowed or authorized by regulatory agencies or other statutes.â€ [25] \r\nWe therefore hold the circuit court erred in declining \r\n  to hold that, as a matter of law, the regulatory exemption of section 39-5-40 \r\n  of the UTPA applies to this lawsuit and bars InMedâ€™s UTPA claim.Â  Because our \r\n  determination of this issue controls the case, we need not address MedQuestâ€™s \r\n  remaining arguments or InMedâ€™s cross-appeal concerning treble damages and attorney \r\n  fees.

Anderson, \r\n  Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nT. Preston Reid, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  The family court granted \r\n  Cheryl Howard Craig (Wife) and William Rhett Craig, III (Husband) a divorce \r\n  and divided the marital property.Â  The court set alimony and child support, \r\n  ordered the marital home be sold and the equity evenly distributed, granted \r\n  Wife a special equity interest in several nonmarital properties, and awarded \r\n  Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe parties were married in 1974, while Husband \r\n  was in medical school.Â  Soon thereafter, Husband commenced his service commitment \r\n  to the United States Army and the couple was stationed in Alaska.Â  They returned \r\n  to Charleston, where Husband finished his medical residency.Â  The parties later \r\n  moved to Greenville, where they continue to reside.Â  Husband and Wife have three \r\n  children.Â  At the time of the divorce, the oldest child lived at home as a result \r\n  of injuries suffered in a childhood bicycle accident.Â  The second child completed \r\n  college, but was residing at home while searching for employment.Â  The youngest \r\n  child was a junior in high school and also lived at the marital residence. \r\nWife has a Masters Degree in nursing and has been \r\n  employed as a critical care nurse.Â  She has been fully employed for several \r\n  years, though she worked part-time during a portion of the marriage.Â  She earns \r\n  approximately $60,000.00 per year.Â  Husband is a partner in a medical group \r\n  and specializes in internal medicine.Â  While his income declined when his group \r\n  separated, his income at the time of the hearing was approximately $200,000.00 \r\n  per year.\r\nThe parties had significant marital property, \r\n  including a house valued over $500,000.00 with equity of over $260,000.00, significant \r\n  personal property, Husbandâ€™s retirement account valued over $1.8 million, and \r\n  savings and investment accounts.Â  Husband had several nonmarital properties, \r\n  which he inherited from his father.Â  However, marital funds were used for some \r\n  improvements on the property after the inheritance. \r\nWife filed this action for divorce and \r\n  sought custody of the youngest child, division of the marital property, alimony, \r\n  child support, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband sought joint custody and admitted \r\n  his responsibility to pay child support.Â  Further, he sought equitable distribution \r\n  of the property, including the marital residence.\r\nBy consent at a temporary hearing, Wife \r\n  received sole custody of the minor child and retained use of the marital residence.Â  \r\n  Husband agreed to pay child support in the amount of $900.00 per month and the \r\n  mortgage on the residence of $3,425.00 per month.Â  Wife was allowed to withdraw \r\n  $20,000.00 to defray costs of litigation and other expenses.\r\nHusband admitted adultery prior to separation, \r\n  and this was the basis for the divorce.Â  The court concluded alimony of $500.00 \r\n  per month was warranted.Â  Wife was permitted to remain in the marital home until \r\n  the youngest son graduated from high school.Â  Until that time, she received \r\n  $850.00 in transitional alimony.Â  Once the son graduated, the marital home was \r\n  to be sold and the equity divided evenly between the parties.\r\nThe court found nonmarital assets owned \r\n  by Husband were not transmuted into marital property, but that Wife was entitled \r\n  to a special equity in the property.Â  The court concluded marital funds were \r\n  used for improvements and awarded Wife a special equity of $8,036.78.\r\nThe court further divided the remaining \r\n  marital property equally.Â  Wife was given the furniture, two retirement accounts, \r\n  a savings account, and her vehicle.Â  Husband was awarded some furniture, several \r\n  accounts, his vehicle, and the boat.Â  Husbandâ€™s retirement account was divided \r\n  such that the ultimate distribution was equal.\r\nAfter considering the fault of Husband \r\n  in the divorce, as well as the other appropriate factors, the court concluded \r\n  Wife was entitled to a contribution towards her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\n  She was awarded a total of $21,370.00, with Husband receiving credit for half \r\n  of the $20,000.00 that Wife was allowed to withdraw from an account pursuant \r\n  to the temporary order.\r\nWife filed a motion to alter or amend \r\n  the courtâ€™s judgment, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The court determined the \r\n  personal property was properly valued for purposes of equitable distribution.Â  \r\n  The requirement that the marital home was to be sold was reaffirmed; however, \r\n  the judge extended the time until the sale was required.Â  Finally, the last \r\n  major amendment was to the amount of alimony.Â  The transitional alimony was \r\n  set at $3,000.00 per month and was to be applied to the mortgage and expenses \r\n  of the marital home.Â  It was set to continue until December 2003 when the marital \r\n  home was to be offered for sale.Â  At that time, the periodic alimony was ordered \r\n  decreased to $875.00 per month.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has the \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992); Oâ€™Neill v. Oâ€™Neill, 293 S.C. 112, 359 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1987).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this Court \r\n  to disregard the factual findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are we required to ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n        \r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to award sufficient \r\n  permanent periodic alimony?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Did the trial court err in failing to award Wife \r\n  ownership of the marital residence instead of requiring its sale?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to award Wife \r\n  a sufficient special equity interest in Husbandâ€™s nonmarital property?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to properly value \r\n  the personal property for inclusion in the equitable distribution?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony\r\nWife maintains the trial court erred in \r\n  awarding transitional alimony and not awarding a greater amount of permanent \r\n  periodic alimony given the financial status of the parties and the lifestyle \r\n  to which Wife was accustomed.Â  We agree.Â  Luculently, the dissolution of the \r\n  marriage in this case resulted from the fault of the Husband.Â  The Husband committed \r\n  adultery pre-separation of the Husband and Wife.Â  The adultery committed by \r\n  the Husband destroyed this marital relationship.Â  Indubitably, the Husband is \r\n  at fault.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion \r\n  of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002); \r\n  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, 535 S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000); Hatfield \r\n  v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 364, 489 S.E.2d 212, 215 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAlimony \r\n  is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  \r\n  Spence v.

Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct.

Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2003); Hatfield, 327 S.C. at 364, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d at 215.Â Â  The court is required to consider all relevant factors in determining \r\n  alimony.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994); see also Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 290, 555 \r\n  S.E.2d 386, 391 (2001) (finding the trial courtâ€™s denial of alimony was erroneous \r\n  because the court did not address â€œseveral important factorsâ€ when determining \r\n  no alimony should be awarded).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Lide v. Lide, \r\n  277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).Â  â€œFault is an appropriate factor \r\n  for consideration in determining alimony in cases where the misconduct affected \r\n  the economic circumstances of the parties or contributed to the breakup of the \r\n  marriage.â€Â  Smith, 327 S.C. at 463, 486 S.E.2d at 523-24.\r\nSouth Carolina law requires the court \r\n  to award support sufficient to allow Appellant to maintain the standard of living \r\n  the parties had themselves chosen and lived by during their marriage.Â  The standard \r\n  of living established during this marriage was very high.Â  The parties lived \r\n  in one of the most influential neighborhoods in Greenville; vacationed at the \r\n  Husbandâ€™s family lake house, which is in a gated community; enjoyed recreating \r\n  on their boat; and drove luxury automobiles.\r\nâ€œAlthough rehabilitative alimony may be \r\n  an appropriate form of spousal support in some cases, permanent periodic alimony \r\n  is favored in South Carolina.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 95, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 531, 535 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œRehabilitative alimony may be awarded \r\n  only upon a showing of special circumstances justifying a departure from the \r\n  normal preference for permanent periodic support.Â  The purpose of rehabilitative \r\n  alimony is to encourage a dependent spouse to become self-supporting after a \r\n  divorce.â€Â  Id. (citing Johnson, 296 S.C. at 301, 372 S.E.2d at \r\n  114.).\r\nIn this case, the court concluded that \r\n  Wife should receive $875.00 in permanent periodic alimony.Â  We reject the finding \r\n  by the trial court on permanent periodic alimony.Â  His ruling completely overlooks \r\n  the standard of living in place at the time of the separation of the parties.Â  \r\n  We award the Wife $3000 per month of permanent periodic alimony.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Equitable Distribution\r\nWife contends the trial court erred in \r\n  distributing the marital property. First, she maintains the court assigned an \r\n  incorrect valuation to the personal property, which was awarded to her.Â  Second, \r\n  she asserts the family court should have awarded her sole possession of the \r\n  marital home instead of requiring it to be sold or her to purchase Husbandâ€™s \r\n  share.\r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within \r\n  the discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. \r\n  37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. \r\n  2002) provides the family court must consider fifteen factors and give each \r\n  weight as it determines.Â  On review, this court looks to the fairness of the \r\n  overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, the fact that this \r\n  court might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court \r\n  is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d \r\n  107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, \r\n  859 (Ct. App. 1996) (the reviewing court will affirm the family court judgeâ€™s \r\n  apportionment of marital property if it can be determined that the judge addressed \r\n  the relevant factors under section 20-7-472 with sufficiency for the reviewing \r\n  court to conclude the judge was cognizant of the statutory factors).\r\nIn this case, the overall distribution was fifty \r\n  percent of the estate to each party.Â  We find, given the statutory factors, \r\n  that this distribution is fair and equitable. Â Given the length of the marriage, \r\n  the value of the marital property, and the incomes of the parties, we find the \r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an even distribution of \r\n  the marital property.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Personal Property Valuation\r\nWife argues the family court erred in \r\n  its valuation of the personal property it awarded to her.Â  She maintains the \r\n  value assigned was much greater than the fair market value and does not have \r\n  a proper basis in the record.Â  We agree the family court erred in the value \r\n  assigned to the property.\r\nIn dividing marital property, the family \r\n  court must identify both real and personal property and determine the fair market \r\n  value of the identified property.Â Â  Perry v. Estate of Perry, 323 S.C. \r\n  232, 237, 473 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The value given personal property \r\n  should be its fair market value.Â  Id. at 238, 473 S.E.2d at 864.\r\nThe trial court found the value of the \r\n  personal property in Wifeâ€™s possession to be $185,743.00.Â  The trial court took \r\n  the value of the personal property off the Wifeâ€™s declaration of property and \r\n  then subtracted the value assigned to the furnishings in Husbandâ€™s possession.Â  \r\n  However, the court did not adjust for the values of various bank accounts and \r\n  other items also included in the delineation by Wife.Â  The $195,000.00 figure \r\n  offered by Wife clearly includes items such as vehicles and multiple savings \r\n  and investment accounts, as these are not delineated separately on the declaration \r\n  form.Â  Additionally, Wife submitted a more detailed valuation of the property, \r\n  which totaled $70,789.00.Â  Finally, Husbandâ€™s estimated valuation of the personal \r\n  property totaled only $62,000.00. \r\nWe find the family court failed to make \r\n  the proper adjustments in valuing the personal property assigned to Wife.Â  The \r\n  value is not the fair market value, as the figure used included items not awarded \r\n  to Wife as part of the personal property.Â  The only figures before the court \r\n  that valued only the personal property were the $70,789.00 offered by Wife and \r\n  the $62,000.00 offered by Husband.Â  \r\nWe remand to the court for a determination of an \r\n  accurate value of the personal property awarded to Wife.Â  Additionally, the \r\n  family court is instructed to maintain the fifty percent award for each party \r\n  by making the necessary adjustments to the distribution.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Marital Residence\r\nWife contends the family court erred in \r\n  not awarding her the marital residence and instead requiring her to buy out \r\n  Husbandâ€™s share or sell the home.\r\nIn order to effect an equitable apportionment, \r\n  the family court may require the sale of marital property and a division of \r\n  the proceeds.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-476 (Supp. 2002) (providing that â€œ[t]he court in making \r\n  an equitable apportionment may order the public or private sale of all or any \r\n  portion of the marital property upon terms it determinesâ€).Â  The court, however, \r\n  should first attempt an â€œin-kindâ€ distribution of the marital assets.Â  Donahue, \r\n  299 S.C. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745; Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. \r\n  412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988).Â  A family court may grant a spouse title to the \r\n  marital home as part of the equitable distribution.Â  Donahue, 299 S.C. \r\n  at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745.Â  Pursuant to section 20-7-472(10) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code, the court, in making apportionment, â€œmust give weight in such proportion \r\n  as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors: . . . (10) the desirability \r\n  of awarding the family home as part of equitable distribution.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-472(10) (Supp. 2003).\r\nSection 20-7-472 lists fifteen factors \r\n  for the family court to consider when making an equitable apportionment of the \r\n  marital estate.Â  Bowers, 349 S.C. at 97, 561 S.E.2d at 616.Â  The statute \r\n  vests the family court with the discretion to decide what weight should be assigned \r\n  to the various factors.Â  Id.Â  On review, this court looks to the overall \r\n  fairness of the apportionment, and if the result is equitable, that this court \r\n  might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nThe family court is to â€œcarefully consider the \r\n  claim of a party that the interests of that party or the children are so predominant, \r\n  when balanced against the interests of the other, that an award of exclusive \r\n  possession of the marital home is compelled.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 285 \r\n  S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nIt is not equitable for the home to be \r\n  sold and Wife required to move from the marital home.Â  Based on our review of \r\n  the evidence, we conclude the assets should be divided in-kind as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        HUSBAND:\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Health Source\r\n        $15,000.00\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Timberwoods\r\n

awarding the marital home to the Wife in the equitable \r\n  distribution as outlined above, we rule that the Wife must pay the mortgage \r\n  payment on the marital home.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Special Equity\r\nWife contends the family court failed \r\n  to award her a sufficient special equity in the nonmarital property inherited \r\n  by Husband.Â  She asserts the valuation of her work and the amount of marital \r\n  funds used to improve the property were greater than that calculated by the \r\n  trial court.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 20-7-473(5) \r\n  allows a special equity for the increase in value of nonmarital property resulting \r\n  from the material contribution of the nonowner spouse.Â  The spouse is entitled \r\n  to a special interest to compensate for the contributions made to the nonmarital \r\n  property and for the marital funds used in the improvement of the nonmarital \r\n  property.Â  See Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 159, 439 S.E.2d \r\n  312, 316 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nThe trial court in this case only considered \r\n  the monetary contributions from marital funds.Â  He made no allowance for Wifeâ€™s \r\n  contributions through her efforts or for any overall increase in the value of \r\n  the property.Â  If Wifeâ€™s contributions increased the value of the property or \r\n  if she put forth sufficient effort to result in a material contribution, this \r\n  needed to be considered by the family court.Â  We remand this issue to the trial \r\n  court to properly consider the full extent of Wifeâ€™s contributions, the full \r\n  amount of marital funds employed, and any increase in the value of the property \r\n  resulting directly from the contributions of Wife.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the amount of alimony provided \r\n  by the family court was not sufficient and equitable.Â  We conclude the overall \r\n  apportionment of property at fifty percent to each party was appropriate.Â  The \r\n  trial court did err in requiring the sale of the marital home.Â  We rule the \r\n  family court erred in its valuation of the special equity to be awarded Wife, \r\n  as it only considered the exact dollar amounts contributed and did not also \r\n  take into consideration any work done by Wife or the increase in the valuation \r\n  of the property as a result of Wifeâ€™s contributions.Â  We conclude the valuation \r\n  of the personal property was in error.Â  We hold the family court shall maintain \r\n  the same fifty-percent equitable distributions, but must make such changes as \r\n  necessary to the apportionment to adjust for changes in the valuation of the \r\n  personal property consistent with this opinion.Â  Accordingly, the decision of \r\n  the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\nCURETON, J., concurs and dissents in a separate \r\n  opinion.\r\nCURETON, AJ (Concurring and dissenting in part): \r\n  I disagree with the majority on the issues of the amount of alimony and \r\n  the award to Wife of exclusive ownership of the marital home. I treat these \r\n  issues together because they are so closely intertwined. \r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within \r\n  the family court judgeâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 97, \r\n  561 S.E.2d 610, 616 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2002) \r\n  lists fifteen factors for the family court to consider when making an equitable \r\n  apportionment of the marital estate and vests the family court with the discretion \r\n  to determine what weight should be assigned to each factor.Â  On review, this \r\n  court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and if the result \r\n  is equitable, taken as a whole, that this court might have weighed specific \r\n  factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe right of spouses to realize the benefits of \r\n  equity in a marital home has always been guarded in this state.Â  As the majority \r\n  correctly points out, the family court is to â€œcarefully consider the claim of \r\n  a party that the interests of that party or the children are so predominant, \r\n  when balanced against the interests of the other, that an award of exclusive \r\n  possession of the marital home is compelled.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 285 \r\n  S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The rationale for scrutinizing \r\n  such requests lies in the substantial burden upon the party who must defer realization \r\n  of the value of his or her share of the marital home.Â  Morris v. Morris, \r\n  335 S.C. 525, 534, 517 S.E.2d 720, 725 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nSome, but not all, of the compelling interests the court \r\n  may consider are:Â  (1) adequate shelter for minors; (2) the inability of the \r\n  occupying spouse to otherwise obtain adequate housing; (3) the size of the non-occupying \r\n  spouseâ€™s equity in the home relative to his other assets or income; (4) the \r\n  size of the home relative to the expected use and the cost of maintaining the \r\n  home in comparison to the benefits received; and (5) the potential duration \r\n  of the exclusive possession.Â  See Morris, 335 S.C. at 534, 517 \r\n  S.E.2d at 725.Â  \r\nThe threshold issue in this case is whether the \r\n  award of the house to Wife is required to maintain her standard of living or \r\n  whether the award of the exclusive ownership of the house places too great of \r\n  a burden on Husband.Â  The trial judge concluded it was not essential to her \r\n  standard of living to remain in the house, and I agree.Â  \r\nFactually, the house was acquired when the household \r\n  consisted of five persons, the parties and their three children. [1] Â  The children are now emancipated and are not a factor in considering \r\n  Wifeâ€™s needs.Â  The trial court properly allowed Wife the continued use of the \r\n  marital residence while the youngest child was still in high school.Â  \r\nThe house has five bedrooms, three and a half baths \r\n  and over 5000 square feet.Â  The trial court found that Wife had not demonstrated \r\n  she had any practical need for a home the size of the marital home now that \r\n  two children are completely emancipated.  \r\n  [2] Â  The costs of ownership of a house that size for one person greatly \r\n  outweigh any need or benefit obtained from allowing Wife to retain the property.\r\nThere is no indication Wife cannot find a suitable \r\n  home in the same or similar neighborhood, while greatly reducing her monthly \r\n  housing expenses.Â  She testified that she enjoyed the safety offered by the \r\n  neighborhood and the ability to walk the neighborhood pathways.Â  However, she \r\n  also admitted that other neighborhoods could offer just as much and be just \r\n  as secure.Â  \r\nThe trial court reasoned that the parties could \r\n  sell the marital home and realize over $250,000 from its sale.Â  Expert testimony \r\n  provided that the parties could then split the equity and each could purchase \r\n  another home for approximately $250,000 paying $125,000 down, and thereafter \r\n  have housing expenses of approximately $1664.00 per month instead of the $4,441.00 \r\n  per month expense on the marital home.Â  The court further concluded that unitizing \r\n  Wifeâ€™s claimed expenses and adding to them the $1664.00 projected housing expense, \r\n  her total expenses would be approximately $4,700.00 per month.Â  Finally, the \r\n  trial court concluded that by awarding Wife $875.00 per month in permanent alimony, \r\n  she would still have approximately $600 per month left after paying her expenses.Â  \r\n  Wifeâ€™s share of the equity in the home, coupled with her income, alimony, and \r\n  the other assets she receives in the distribution will allow her to obtain more \r\n  than sufficient housing and maintain her standard of living.\r\nQuestions concerning alimony rest within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, \r\n  351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based \r\n  upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.Â  McKnight v. McKnight, \r\n  283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984). In appeals from family \r\n  court, the appellate court has authority to find facts in accordance with its \r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  However, when an appellate court \r\n  chooses to find facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence, the court \r\n  must state distinctly its findings of fact and the reason for its decision.Â  \r\n  Dearybury, 351 S.C. at 283, 569 S.E.2d at 369.\r\nAlimony is a substitute for the support \r\n  that is normally incident to the marital relationship.Â  Ordinarily, the purpose \r\n  of alimony is to place the supported spouse, as nearly as practical, in the \r\n  position of support he or she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Alimony should not \r\n  dissuade a spouse, to the extent possible, from becoming self-supporting.Â  McElveen \r\n  v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œWhere, \r\n  as here, a wife has been awarded a fair percentage of the marital estate, it \r\n  is error to award her permanent alimony substantially in excess of her needs.â€Â  \r\n  Woodard v. Woodard, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987). Such an award â€œis in the nature of a division of the husbandâ€™s future \r\n  excess income.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe reason expressed by the majority for \r\n  increasing Wifeâ€™s alimony was to maintain her standard of living.Â  It became \r\n  clear during oral argument that but for the excessive mortgage payment Wife \r\n  would be burdened with if she remains in the marital home, there would be no \r\n  practical need for alimony in excess of the amount awarded by the trial court.Â  \r\n  Thus, the result of the majorityâ€™s decision to award Wife the marital home is \r\n  to artificially create a need for additional alimony to pay the expenses on \r\n  the marital residence.Â  \r\nClearly, Husband was at fault in the breakup of \r\n  this marriage and should incur some penalty for his marital fault.Â  The trial \r\n  court provided significant marital assets to Wife and allowed her to maintain \r\n  her standard of living without the extravagance of a home that is too costly \r\n  for her needs.Â  The award by the majority is excessive and unnecessary given \r\n  her lifestyle and actual needs.Â  As the trial courtâ€™s order is structured, I \r\n  fail to see an abuse of discretion in its award of alimony and the required \r\n  sale of the marital home.Â  I would affirm those awards. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  At time of trial, the court found that Wife, the \r\n    partiesâ€™ oldest child Zackery age 27, and a minor child lived in the home.Â  \r\n    The court further found that all of the children had the benefit of educational \r\n    trusts, from inheritances.Â  Additionally, while Zackery suffered a head injury \r\n    as a child in an accident, he â€œis capable of sole support and has other resources \r\n    to rely upon for his support.â€ At oral argument, Wifeâ€™s counsel informed the \r\n    court that only Zackery continued to remain in the marital home. In any event \r\n    there is no contention that Wife should be awarded the marital home to accommodate \r\n    the partiesâ€™ children.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The trial court concluded â€œ[t] his ruling does \r\n    not prevent [Wife] from buying [Husbandâ€™s] interest in the house (using the \r\n    agreed valuation) or on other terms mutually agreeable to them.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3767","title":"Hunt v.

Philip Murphy, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  The South Carolina Forestry \r\n  Commission (â€œSCFCâ€) appeals an order of the trial court, which held that a deed \r\n  granted to the SCFC in 1937 conveying a ten-acre tract of land merely conveyed \r\n  a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter and not a fee simple \r\n  absolute.Â  We reverse. [1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 11, 1937, The First Carolinas Joint \r\n  Stock Land Bank of Columbia issued a deed to the SCFC granting the commission \r\n  ten acres of land for the consideration of one dollar.Â  \r\nThe granting clause of this deed reads:\r\n\r\nThe First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbiaâ€¦ [has] \r\n  granted, bargained, sold and released, and by these presents [does] grant, bargain, \r\n  sell and release unto the said [SCFC] and their successors in office all \r\n  that certain piece . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe habendum clause provides:\r\n\r\nTo Have and to Hold all and singular the premises before mentioned \r\n  unto the said [SCFC] and their successors in office, and assigns forever.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nFollowing a description of the property \r\n  conveyed to the SCFC, the deed states:\r\n\r\n[T]his deed is upon the express condition that the grantee \r\n  shall with reasonable dispatch erect and maintain on said lands a suitable fire \r\n  tower or towers and suitable buildings for the keeper thereof, and use said \r\n  lands in furthering the cause of reforestation and forest protection, and should \r\n  the grantee at any time for a period of two years cease to use the property \r\n  aforesaid for said purposes the title thereto shall revert to the grantor, its \r\n  successors and assigns, provided, however, that in such case the grantee shall \r\n  have the right to remove any fire tower or towers or other buildings, if any \r\n  which the grantee may place on the said lands.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, The First Carolinas Joint \r\n  Stock Land Bank of Columbia sold a piece of property adjacent to the ten-acre \r\n  tract to Thomas Thain.Â  This deed to Thain intended to convey the reversionary \r\n  rights to the SCFCâ€™s ten-acre parcel.\r\nBy deed granted in 1943, Thain \r\n  conveyed various parcels of land to J.W. Hunt, Sr., including most of the tract \r\n  granted to Thain by the bank.Â  This deed purported to convey to J.W. Hunt, Sr., \r\n  the reversionary rights in the parcel at issue in this case.\r\nVia an instrument entitled â€œDeed of Reversionary \r\n  Rightsâ€ dated March 30, 1984, J.W. Hunt, Sr., conveyed to J.W. Hunt, Jr., and \r\n  William R. Hunt (â€œRespondentsâ€) any interest he had received from Thain by the \r\n  1943 deed in the ten-acre parcel at issue.\r\nIn 1984, Respondents asked the \r\n  SCFC for a wider easement across the ten-acre tract for the purpose of allowing \r\n  trucks greater accessibility in harvesting the tractâ€™s lumber.Â  Prior to granting \r\n  Respondents an easement, however, the SCFC requested they execute an estoppel \r\n  agreement whereby Respondents agreed they would not use the easement extension \r\n  as a basis for arguing that the property had reverted to them.Â  This document \r\n  was drafted by Respondentsâ€™ attorney and was signed by Respondents.Â  The agreement \r\n  did not profess to bind the SCFC and was not signed by any agent of the State \r\n  of South Carolina or the SCFC.\r\nWith the advent of airplane surveillance, \r\n  the use of fire towers for forest protection became obsolete.Â  In 1993 and 1994, \r\n  the fire tower and accompanying buildings located on the ten-acre parcel were \r\n  removed.Â  The SCFC and Respondents undertook preparations to transfer the land \r\n  to Respondents.Â  After about a year and half of working with the SCFC on obtaining \r\n  the ten-acre tract, [2]  the SCFC informed Respondents that their attorneys believed \r\n  that Respondents had no valid interest in the property.Â  Based on the SCFCâ€™s \r\n  refusal to transfer the land, Respondents initiated an action seeking a grant \r\n  of clear title to the ten-acre parcel.\r\nBy order filed June 28, 2001, the trial \r\n  court found that the SCFC was the owner of the land in question.Â  Following \r\n  a hearing on Respondentsâ€™ motion to reconsider, however, the trial court withdrew \r\n  its initial order and filed a substitute order.Â  In the substituted order, the \r\n  trial court found that the deed granting the land to the SCFC conveyed only \r\n  a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter.Â  Furthermore, the \r\n  court found that the conditional fee had terminated in 1997. Nevertheless, the \r\n  order denied Respondentsâ€™ claim to legal title of the land due to the fact that \r\n  inter vivos transfers of reversionary rights are invalid and without \r\n  effect in South Carolina. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe construction of a clear and unambiguous \r\n  deed is a question of law for the court.Â  Gardner v. Mozingo, 293 S.C. \r\n  23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 392 (1987); Hammond v. Lindsay, 277 S.C. 182, \r\n  184, 284 S.E.2d 581, 582 (1981).Â  â€œ[I]t is the duty of the court to construe \r\n  deeds and determine their legal effect, where there is no such ambiguity as \r\n  requires parol proof and submission to the jury.â€Â  26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ \r\n  168 (2001).Â  \r\n\r\nDeeds are construed to determine the intent of the parties.Â  \r\n  To construe a deed, a court looks first at the language of the instrument because \r\n  the court presumes it declares the intent of the parties.Â  When, and only when, \r\n  the meaning of a deed is not clear, or is ambiguous or uncertain, will a court \r\n  resort to established rules of construction to aid in the ascertainment of the \r\n  grantorâ€™s intention by artificial means where such intention cannot otherwise \r\n  be ascertained.\r\n\r\n23 Am.Jur.2d Deeds Â§ 192 (2002).Â  â€œ[I]f the \r\n  language of the deed is unambiguous, then its interpretation is a question of \r\n  law to be resolved by the reviewing court without resort to extrinsic evidence.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  While a trial courtâ€™s findings of fact in a nonjury action at law \r\n  should not be disturbed on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support, \r\n  a reviewing court is free to decide questions of law with no particular deference \r\n  to the trial court.Â  See Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 \r\n  S.C. 291, 296, 468 S.E.2d 292, 295 (1996); Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church \r\n  of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000); see Okatie \r\n  River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 \r\n  S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate \r\n  court standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.â€); \r\n  State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Moorer, 330 S.C. 46, 51, 496 S.E.2d \r\n  875, 878 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œIn legal actions, our scope of review extends only \r\n  to the correction of errors of law.â€).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe SCFC argues that the 1937 deed granted it the \r\n  ten-acre tract in fee simple absolute; thus they are under no legal obligation, \r\n  no matter how the property is used, to transfer the tract to Respondents.Â  We \r\n  agree.\r\nRespondents assert that the language following \r\n  the physical description of the property in the deed â€œcuts downâ€ the fee simple \r\n  conveyance of the granting clause to a fee simple determinable with a possibility \r\n  of reverter.Â  While this is certainly a sensible interpretation of this deed \r\n  when read in its entirety, this construction is nevertheless legally incorrect.Â  \r\n  It is a well established rule of law that where the granting clause of a deed \r\n  purports to convey title in fee simple, the estate may not be cut down by subsequent \r\n  words in the same instrument.Â  Shealy v. South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co., \r\n  278 S.C. 132, 135, 293 S.E.2d 306, 308 (1982) (â€œWhere granting clause in deed \r\n  purports to convey fee simple absolute title, subsequent provisions of deed \r\n  cannot diminish that granted or deprive grantee of incidents of ownership in \r\n  property.â€); County of Abbeville v. Knox, 267 S.C. 38, 40, 225 S.E.2d \r\n  863, 864 (1976) (holding where the deed conveyed fee simple absolute estate \r\n  in its granting clause by use of words of inheritance, provision inserted in \r\n  deed after description of property, that property would be used for industrial \r\n  development, is not a condition subsequent; instead, deed would be construed \r\n  as conveying a fee simple absolute estate); Stylecraft, Inc. v. Thomas, \r\n  250 S.C. 495, 498, 159 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1968) (finding that â€œthe granting clause \r\n  conveyed a fee simple absolute; the restrictive words following the description \r\n  of the property were ineffectual to cut down that estateâ€).Â  Only if the granting \r\n  clause is deemed â€œindefinite,â€ may the court look to other parts of the deed \r\n  to ascertain the intent of the grantor.Â  See Batesburg-Leesville Sch. \r\n  Dist. No. 3 v. Tarrant, 293 S.C. 442, 445, 361 S.E.2d 343, 345 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987).\r\nRespondents argue that the granting clause of the \r\n  1937 deed is indefinite due to the lack of the word â€œforever.â€Â  The granting \r\n  clause of the deed in question conveys the tract to the SCFC and â€œand their \r\n  successors in office.â€Â  Traditionally, the phrase â€œand their successors in office, \r\n  foreverâ€ is the classic language of inheritance used for granting a fee simple \r\n  absolute in land to a government entity.Â  See Hoogenboom v. City of \r\n  Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 316, 433 S.E.2d 875, 882 (Ct. App. 1992).Â Â Â  \r\nTo constitute a definite grant in fee simple absolute, \r\n  the granting clause of a deed must contain language of inheritance limiting \r\n  the grant to the intended grantee and his heirs.Â  McMichael v. McMichael, \r\n  51 S.C. 555, 557, 29 S.E. 403, 403 (1898); see also Wayburn \r\n  v. Smith, 270 S.C. 38, 42, 239 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1977) (â€œIt is the rule in \r\n  this State that where an incomplete or indefinite estate is conveyed by the \r\n  granting clause, as for instance where no words of inheritance accompany the \r\n  grant, or where the granting clause creates a life estate, resort may be had \r\n  to the habendum for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the grantor \r\n  and thus a life estate may be enlarged into a fee simple estate.â€); Atl. \r\n  Coast Lumber Corp. v. Langston Lumber Co., 128 S.C. 7, 9, 122 S.E. 395, \r\n  396 (1924) (â€œA conveyance of real estate not carrying the word â€˜heirsâ€™ cannot \r\n  convey the fee.â€); Tarrant, 293 S.C. at 445, 361 S.E.2d at 345 (finding \r\n  an indefinite estate was conveyed by the granting clause because of the omission \r\n  of words of inheritance; and therefore, resort was had to the habendum clause \r\n  for the purpose of ascertaining the intent of the grantors).Â  This court is \r\n  unaware, however, of any authority requiring the inclusion of words of perpetuity \r\n  such as â€œforeverâ€ in a deedâ€™s granting clause.Â  On the contrary, when looking \r\n  at case law concerning deeds granting fee simple to individuals, it appears, \r\n  by analogy, that no such language is necessary.Â  See Antley v. Antley, \r\n  132 S.C. 306, 309, 128 S.E. 31, 32 (1925) (â€œA deed to one and his heirs grants \r\n  a fee-simple estate.â€).Â  When conveying property to a government entity, the \r\n  words â€œsuccessors in officeâ€ contemplate the same principle of inheritance that \r\n  â€œheirsâ€ would in a deed granted to an individual.Â  While the phrase â€œsuccessors \r\n  in officeâ€ is bolstered by the word â€œforever,â€ the word is not logically required \r\n  to communicate the required limitation on inheritance.Â  \r\nFurthermore, in Shealy, the supreme court \r\n  held that the granting clause â€œgrant, bargain, sell and release unto the said \r\n  Lexington Water Power Company, its successors and assignsâ€ was a definite grant \r\n  of a fee simple estate.Â  278 S.C. at 134, 293 S.E.2d at 307.Â  The court did \r\n  so with no mention or record in its opinion of any words of perpetuity in the \r\n  deedâ€™s granting clause such as â€œforever.â€Â  We conclude, therefore, that the \r\n  word â€œforeverâ€ is not required in the granting clause of a deed for the clause \r\n  to constitute a definite grant of fee simple absolute.Â  \r\nWhen reading the 1937 deed in its entirety, it \r\n  does appear that the grantor intended the property to revert on the occurrence \r\n  of certain circumstances set forth in the deed.Â  While it is a cardinal rule \r\n  of deed construction that the intention of the grantor must be ascertained and \r\n  effectuated, this intention cannot stand if it contravenes some well settled \r\n  rule of law or public policy.Â  Wayburn, 270 S.C. at 41, 239 S.E.2d at \r\n  892.Â  In a â€œlong and unbroken line of decisions,â€ South Carolina courts have \r\n  approved the rule that where the granting clause in a deed purports to convey \r\n  title in fee simple absolute, that estate may not be cut down by subsequent \r\n  words in the same instrument.Â  Stylecraft, 250 S.C. at 497, 159 S.E.2d \r\n  at 47; accord Shealy, 278 S.C. at 135, 293 S.E.2d at 308; Knox, \r\n  267 S.C. at 40, 225 S.E.2d at 864.Â  This court â€œwill not undertake to overthrow \r\n  a rule of property so long established.â€Â  Purvis v. McElveen, 234 S.C. \r\n  94, 102, 106 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1959).Â  This rule of construction must be adhered \r\n  to even if it runs contrary to the express intentions of the grantor.Â  Stylecraft, \r\n  250 S.C. at 497, 159 S.E.2d at 47.Â  This contention is best expressed in Creswell \r\n  v. Bank of Greenwood, 210 S.C. 47, 55, 41 S.E.2d 393, 397 (1947) (quoted \r\n  in Wayburn, 270 S.C. at 43, 239 S.E.2d at 892-93), as follows:\r\n\r\n[I]ntention is unavailing to avoid [a rule of law] where \r\n  words of settled legal import are used and contrary principles are encountered.Â  \r\n  In such cases the intention will be conclusively presumed to accord with the \r\n  established meaning of the words and to conform to the fixed rules of construction.Â  \r\n  Otherwise, there would be little stability of land titles.\r\n\r\nUpon finding that the granting clause of the 1937 deed constitutes \r\n  a definite grant in fee simple, this court must hold that the purpose clause \r\n  following the property description is ineffectual.Â  The SCFC, therefore, owns \r\n  the ten-acre parcel in fee simple absolute, notwithstanding any comments Mr. \r\n  Bumble may care to make on the matter. \r\n  [3] Â Â  \r\nAlternatively, were we to assume arguendo that \r\n  the granting clause was indefinite, title in fee simple would still lie with \r\n  the SCFC.Â  It is the rule in this State that where an incomplete or indefinite \r\n  estate is conveyed by the granting clause, as in the instance where no words \r\n  of inheritance accompany the grant, resort may be had to the habendum clause \r\n  for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the grantor.Â  Wayburn, \r\n  270 S.C. at 42, 239 S.E.2d at 892; Bean v. Bean, 253 S.C. 340, 343-44, \r\n  170 S.E.2d 654, 655-56 (1969).Â  The habendum clause of the deed in question \r\n  reads, â€œTo Have and to Hold all and singular the premises before mentioned unto \r\n  the said [SCFC] and their successors in office, and assigns forever.â€Â  \r\n  When a habendum clause contains the traditional words of inheritance, it has \r\n  the effect of enlarging an indefinite granting clause into a fee simple.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Thus, any indefiniteness in the granting clause of the 1937 deed in question \r\n  is cured by the language utilized in the deedâ€™s habendum clause.\r\nRespondents assert, as an additional sustaining \r\n  ground, that the SCFC is estopped from contesting Respondentsâ€™ ownership of \r\n  the land.Â  We find that Respondents have abandoned this issue.Â  Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  cite no authority to support their contention that the actions of the SCFC warrant \r\n  a finding of estoppel.Â  Issues raised in a brief but not supported by authority \r\n  are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal.Â  See In \r\n  re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the order of \r\n  the trial court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Initially, the SCFC helped facilitate this transfer of title to Respondents.Â  \r\n    The parties agreed to what needed to be done prior to this transfer (e.g., \r\n    survey the land, establish proof of a clear chain of title, etc.) and agreed \r\n    to split the costs. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  In discussing this rule of law, the trial judge \r\n    referenced the characterâ€™s quote â€œIf the law supposes that, â€¦ the lawâ€™s a \r\n    ass â€“ a idiot.â€Â  Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist, Chapter 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3768","title":"Austin v.

Todd Darwin, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nGene Adams and Robert E. Davis, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Joseph Michael Austin and Sandra Austin (collectively, \r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€) brought an action against Specialty Transportation Services, \r\n  Inc. (Appellant) and its employee, Walter Ray Bishop, in connection with an \r\n  automobile accident.Â  Respondents obtained an entry of default against Bishop \r\n  and Appellant. [1] Â  The trial \r\n  court awarded actual and punitive damages to Respondents.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [2] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn November 18, 1999, Respondents were seriously injured in \r\n  an automobile accident when a tractor-trailer truck driven by Appellantâ€™s employee \r\n  hit their vehicle.Â  Respondents were traveling south on U.S. 29, and the truck \r\n  was approaching U.S. 29 from an Interstate 85 exit ramp.Â  A stop sign controlled \r\n  the truckâ€™s lane of traffic.Â  However, the driver of the truck failed to yield \r\n  the right of way to Respondentsâ€™ vehicle.Â  The truck entered U.S. 29 and struck \r\n  Respondentsâ€™ vehicle.\r\nJoseph was trapped in the vehicle for more than an hour.Â  \r\n  While Joseph was in the car, he was in tremendous pain, his leg was broken in \r\n  such a way that it was resting between his left shoulder and cheek, and he feared \r\n  he would burn to death.Â  Joseph sustained injuries to his lower back, neck, \r\n  right shoulder, right elbow, right leg, and right ankle.Â  Joseph was hospitalized \r\n  until December 1, 1999.Â  During his hospitalization, Joseph had surgeries on \r\n  his leg and received counseling for depression.Â  Joseph underwent two additional \r\n  surgeries after his release from the hospital and endured painful rehabilitation.Â  \r\n  Joseph described his injuries and resulting pain, including how they have altered \r\n  his life:\r\n\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Did you have immediate problems in all of those areas \r\n  [right knee, right leg, neck, hands, and fingers] after the accident on November \r\n  18, 1999?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  The leg was very evident that it was broken, and I had again a long \r\n  period of that.Â  I complained fairly early about my neck but everybody seemed \r\n  to be more concerned about the leg healing and basically being bedridden.Â  I \r\n  wasnâ€™t using my arm so I assumed that back problem or the neck problem wasnâ€™t \r\n  really apparent.\r\n. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Now, Joe what was the state of your fitness prior to \r\n  the accident?Â  Did you exercise regularly, walk, jog and things like that?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  Yes.Â  My download, or my basically the way Iâ€”instead of other people \r\n  have different ways of relieving stress.Â  My stress reliever is to walk behind \r\n  our house.Â  We had a place about a mile and a half down to a dam, on your way \r\n  you visit like hanging rock and then down to the dam, then you cross the river \r\n  and then you basically backtrack a different trial [sic], which the about the \r\n  same length, that was a daily ritual.Â  Cutting the grass, cutting the bushes, \r\n  pretty muchâ€”we built a deck on the back of our house, me and Sandra.Â  We decided \r\n  we wanted a deck so we built a deck.\r\nAnything I wanted to do.Â  We were going every weekend.Â  If we wanted \r\n  to go somewhere we would pack the car and just go.Â  Jonathan was in the Grand \r\n  Canyon at eight months.Â  It just all changed.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Joe, have you made that walk down to the river since \r\n  the accident occurred?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  No, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Can you make that walk now?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  No, sir.\r\n&nbsp;. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  When you came to [after the accident], Joe, what configuration \r\n  were you in?Â  \r\n[Joseph]:Â  Well, I was laying kind of over and I was looking basically at the \r\n  sole of my shoe of my right leg and I was wondering, â€œWell, how in the heck \r\n  was that there.â€\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Where was that?Â  Show the Judge with your hand.\r\n[Joseph]:Â  Basically, it was laying kind of here.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Youâ€™re showing on your left shoulder between your left \r\n  shoulder and your cheek.\r\n[Joseph]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Were you able to move as if to get out of the car?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  No.Â  Because the door had pressed in on me, and all I could see was \r\n  my foot and what I thought was blood everywhere, it was coffee from my wifeâ€™s \r\n  coffee.Â  And all of the sudden this blue flame shot in and smoke started rolling \r\n  in and I looked at my wife and told her to get away from the car.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  What were your thoughts when the blue flame rolled \r\n  through?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  I thought I was going to burn to death.\r\n. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  What goes through your mind?Â  What went through your \r\n  mind?\r\n[Joseph]: Itâ€™s just a lot of pain, discomfort, question and confusion whatâ€™s \r\n  happened.Â  At time an EMS person hops in the back seat and they start basically \r\n  taking my clothes off with the scissors and stabbing me with a needle.Â  Again, \r\n  it wasâ€”I was trying to get out with the good leg but the good leg was actually \r\n  trapped underneath the console of the car and this leg just over here.\r\n. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  . . . Were you on any pain medication?Â  When did you \r\n  first receive pain medication if you know?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  . . . And I remember a doctor [in the Emergency Room] saying, â€œSon, \r\n  can I take a look at that leg please?â€\r\nAnd I let go and he basically pulled it out and I must have passed out from \r\n  the pain because when I woke back up they were still doing similar things.Â  \r\n  I was trembling, it was cold and they wouldnâ€™t get me any medication because \r\n  they thought I had internal bleeding.\r\n. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Tell us about your neck and back, Joe.Â  What problems \r\n  do you have with your neck and arm?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  Basically, it stiffens up.Â  Like the tingles in the hands, if I drive \r\n  long distances with arms elevated basically I lose my grip capability, ability \r\n  of gripping or stiff gripping.Â  I can still grip like if the object is as big \r\n  as this I can grab it but if itâ€™s as small as a steering wheel on my car itâ€™s \r\n  hard.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Do you have pain in your neck and back?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  Yes, sir, thereâ€™s pain.Â  Thatâ€™s kind of become a thing that you have \r\n  everyday.Â  When you get up in the morning itâ€™s either the leg, itâ€™s the foot, \r\n  itâ€™s the back itâ€™s the beck [sic], itâ€™s the arms, itâ€™s the fingers.\r\n. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  And are you in pain on a daily basis in your leg?\r\n[Joseph]:Â  Yes, sir, neck and pack [sic].\r\n\r\nJosephâ€™s orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Michael Wayne Funderburk, estimates Joseph \r\n  will require surgery on his knee every two to five years for the remainder of \r\n  his life.Â  Dr. Funderburk assessed a forty percent permanent impairment to Josephâ€™s \r\n  lower right extremity.Â  Joseph has $170,010.62 in present and future medical \r\n  bills.Â  At trial, Dr. Funderburk discussed Josephâ€™s present and future condition:\r\n\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  All right, sir.Â  Tell us about \r\n  his course of recovery after that, Doctor.\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  Well, heâ€™s done very well for this fracture \r\n  in my opinion.Â  He certainly has a painful situation as far as his kneecap, \r\n  and this is because of extensive muscle trauma as well as the damage to the \r\n  inside of the knee.Â  Thereâ€™s a lot of scarring and limited mobility over that \r\n  segment, which worsens the arthritic problem underneath that kneecap because \r\n  thereâ€™s so much tethering from the muscle damage and the damage to the kneecap \r\n  proper.\r\nWe have subsequently performed arthroscopy surgery and debridement \r\n  of this, with some benefit.Â  I think that this is going to be a progressive \r\n  problem for him unfortunately.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Well, will he require, in your professional judgment, \r\n  debridement surgery in the future for that knee?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  Yes, I do believe he will.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  How often will he require that in your judgement, Doctor?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  You know, I think that as the arthritis and as the debris within \r\n  the knee builds up he may need this every two years to clean the knee out.Â  \r\n  The only other option you have is to replace the knee.Â  And I think in someone \r\n  this age you would hope that you could use conservative means to try to keep \r\n  this knee as long as you could before you performed a replacement type surgery \r\n  on him.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  This condition that he has in the knee underneath the \r\n  kneecap, is that a painful condition?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  It is.\r\n. . . .\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Okay.Â  Tell us aboutâ€”you said [Joe has] pain in the \r\n  neck and also some tingling or pain into the hands.Â  Tell us what that comes \r\n  from.\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  Well, anytime thereâ€™s swelling or problems around the neck from \r\n  degenerative changes or disk problems there can be neurological symptoms or \r\n  nerve pain down into the hands with numbness being one of the common findings \r\n  into the arms from the neck.Â  \r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Okay.Â  Are these permanent conditions?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  They are.Â  They can be progressive conditions that can worsen.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Is it fair to say theyâ€™re not going to get any better?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  I donâ€™t believe they are.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Okay.Â  Now Doctor, do you believe that Joe has sustained \r\n  a permanent injury to his legâ€”his lower right extremity?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Do you have an opinion as to the percent disability \r\n  he sustained to his lower right extremity?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  Iâ€™ve rated him at forty percent permanent \r\n  impairment to this extremity.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  And that rating is based upon what consideration?\r\n[Funderburk]:Â  That rating is based upon the consideration on limitation of \r\n  motion, the arthritis I know is going to occur within this knee as well as the \r\n  limitation of motion and pain in the right foot as well.Â  I felt that with the \r\n  progressive problems within the right knee as well as the permanency to the \r\n  right foot that this was a rating that I gave to his leg.\r\n\r\nSandra suffered injuries \r\n  to her breast, right hand, and neck.Â  She incurred $57,460.58 in liquidated \r\n  actual damages.Â  Sandra detailed her injuries:\r\n\r\nBasically I had a large bruise \r\n  over my left breast.Â  I ended up having, just from the force of the accident, \r\n  issues with my right hand.Â  It made it hard to pick up things, I broke dishes, \r\n  cookware, that kind of thing, and just issues with fine detail.Â  I had troubleâ€”actually \r\n  when they asked me to sign the informed consent I was hurting signing the informed \r\n  consent.Â  I had difficulty holding the pen to do, that kind, plus I had some \r\n  issues in the neck.\r\n\r\nSandra, who is a registered nurse, \r\n  cared for Joseph twenty-four hours a day for many months.Â  During this time, \r\n  Sandra missed work and lost several bonuses.Â  Sandra enunciated:\r\n\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  In addition to the fact that \r\n  you were under medical treatment, was there any other reason you had to be home \r\n  during that period of time?\r\n[Sandra]:Â  Yes.Â  Part of the stipulation for Joeâ€™s dismissal at the hospital \r\n  was that I would not work and be there for twenty-four hour care giver [sic].Â  \r\n  That was the agreement that we made with the physician to discharge my husband.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]: When Joe was discharged from the hospital, was he discharged \r\n  bedridden?\r\n[Sandra]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Was he discharged in traction?\r\n[Sandra]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]: Was that twenty-four hours a day? [Sandra]: Â Yes, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]: Was Joe able to get out of bed? [Sandra]:Â  No, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]: Was Joe able to go to the bathroom?\r\n[Sandra]:Â  No, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]: Was Joe even able to use a potty seat?\r\n[Sandra]:Â  No, sir.\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Did you have to do all of that for him?\r\n[Sandra]:Â  Yes, sir. \r\n\r\nSandra testified the accident has substantially changed her \r\n  familyâ€™s lives: \r\n\r\n[Respondentsâ€™ Counsel]:Â  Now, how is Joe doing now, Sandra? \r\n[Sandra]:Â  We learn to live with it.Â  Heâ€™s still depressed.Â  Heâ€™s not the same \r\n  guy fourteen years ago.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 2002, Respondents obtained an entry \r\n  of default against the driver of the truck and Appellant.Â  After a combined \r\n  hearing on the issues of relief from default and damages, the trial court denied \r\n  Appellantâ€™s motion for relief from default and awarded actual and punitive damages \r\n  to Respondents.Â  The trial judge awarded Joseph $850,000 in actual damages and \r\n  $2,158,000 in punitive damages.Â  He awarded Sandra $175,000 in actual damages \r\n  and $442,000 in punitive damages.Â  Appellant filed a motion to alter or amend \r\n  the judgment.Â  In response, Respondents filed a motion to open the judgment.Â  \r\n  The trial court denied Appellantâ€™s motion and granted Respondentsâ€™ motion.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial judge has considerable discretion regarding the amount of damages, \r\n  both actual or punitive.Â  Collins Entmâ€™t Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental \r\n  Amusement, 355 S.C. 125, 584 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2003); Kuznik v. Bees \r\n  Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 538 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Because of \r\n  this discretion, our review on appeal is limited to the correction of errors \r\n  of law.Â  Kuznik, 342 S.C. at 611, 538 S.E.2d at 32; Welch v. Epstein, \r\n  342 S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Our task in reviewing a damages \r\n  award is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine if there is any evidence \r\n  to support the damages award.Â  See Hutson v. Cummins Carolinas, Inc., \r\n  280 S.C. 552, 314 S.E.2d 19 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  AMOUNT OF DAMAGE AWARDS\r\nAppellant argues the evidence in the record does \r\n  not support the trial courtâ€™s excessive damage awards to Respondents.Â  We review \r\n  the damage awards separately and distinctly.\r\nA.Â  Actual Damages\r\nBeing mindful of the standard of review in the present case, which does not \r\n  require this Court to weigh the evidence, but merely determine if there is any \r\n  evidence to support the damage awards, we find the amounts of actual damages \r\n  awarded to Joseph and Sandra were proper.Â  See Hutson v. Cummins Carolinas, \r\n  Inc., 280 S.C. 552, 314 S.E.2d 19 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nActual damages are properly called compensatory damages, meaning \r\n  to compensate, to make the injured party whole, to put him in the same position \r\n  he was in prior to the damages received insofar as this is monetarily possible.Â  \r\n  See Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000).Â  Actual \r\n  damages are awarded to a litigant in compensation for his actual loss or injury.Â  \r\n  Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 134 S.E.2d 206 (1964).Â  Actual \r\n  damages are such as will compensate the party for injuries suffered or losses \r\n  sustained.Â  Id.Â  They are such damages as will simply make good or replace \r\n  the loss caused by the wrong or injury.Â  Actual damages are damages in satisfaction \r\n  of, or in recompense for, loss or injury sustained.Â  Barnwell v. Barber-Colman \r\n  Co., 301 S.C. 534, 393 S.E.2d 162 (1989).Â  The goal is to restore the injured \r\n  party, as nearly as possible through the payment of money, to the same position \r\n  he was in before the wrongful injury occurred.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 378, \r\n  529 S.E.2d at 533.\r\nActual or compensatory damages include compensation for all injuries \r\n  which are naturally the proximate result of the alleged wrongful conduct of \r\n  the defendant.Â  See Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. \r\n  567, 106 S.E.2d 258 (1958).Â  The basic measure of actual damages is the amount \r\n  needed to compensate the plaintiff for the losses proximately caused by the \r\n  defendantâ€™s wrong so that the plaintiff will be in the same position he would \r\n  have been in if there had been no wrongful injury.Â  See Rogers, \r\n  233 S.C. at 578, 106 S.E.2d at 264; Hutchison v. Town of Summerville, \r\n  66 S.C. 442, 45 S.E. 8 (1903).\r\nThe trial court awarded $850,000 in actual damages to Joseph.Â  Joseph presented \r\n  uncontested evidence of a total of $170,010.62 in present and future medical \r\n  bills.Â  He testified as to his extreme pain and suffering, impaired ability \r\n  to work, and loss of enjoyment of life.Â  Joseph underwent four surgeries and \r\n  is expected to receive surgery every two years for the remainder of his life.Â  \r\n  In addition, his doctor rated Joseph as having a forty percent permanent \r\n  impairment to his lower right extremity. \r\nThe trial court awarded $175,000 in actual damages to Sandra.Â  Sandra \r\n  presented uncontested evidence of $57,460.58 in liquidated actual damages.Â  \r\n  She testified as to the leave she took from her job as a registered nurse in \r\n  order to care for Joseph twenty-four hours a day for many months.\r\nWe find Joseph and Sandra presented sufficient evidence to support the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s actual damage awards.\r\nB.Â  Propriety of Punitive Damages\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in awarding \r\n  any punitive damages, as they were not supported by the record and are based \r\n  on improper considerations.Â  We disagree.\r\nPunitive damages, also known as exemplary \r\n  damages, are imposed as punishment.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 528 (2000).Â  Punitive damages are allowed in the interest of society \r\n  in the nature of punishment and as a warning and example to deter the wrongdoer \r\n  and others from committing like offenses in the future.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, \r\n  they serve to vindicate a private right by requiring the wrongdoer to pay money \r\n  to the injured party.Â  Id.\r\nPunitive damages serve at least three important \r\n  purposes: (1) punishment of the defendantâ€™s reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious \r\n  conduct; (2) deterrence of similar future conduct by the defendant or others; \r\n  and (3) compensation for the reckless or willful invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  private rights.Â  Id.Â  The paramount purpose for awarding punitive damages \r\n  is not to compensate the plaintiff but to punish and set an example for others.\r\nOn the issue of punitive damages, the highest \r\n  burden of proof known to the civil law is applicable.Â  Section 15-33-135 of \r\n  the South Carolina Code provides:\r\nIn any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, \r\n  the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (Supp. 2003).Â  Punitive \r\n  damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard \r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  35 (1996); Lister v. NationsBank of Delaware, 329 S.C. 133, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  449 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThere is no formula or standard that can \r\n  be used as a measure for assessing punitive damages.Â  However, factors relevant \r\n  to consideration of punitive damages are:\r\n\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  the character of the defendantâ€™s acts;\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  the nature and extent of the harm to plaintiff \r\n  which defendant caused or intended to cause;\r\n(3)Â Â Â Â  defendantâ€™s degree of culpability;\r\n(4)Â Â Â Â  the punishment that should be imposed;\r\n(5)Â Â Â Â  duration of the conduct;\r\n(6)Â Â Â Â  defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment;\r\n(7)Â Â Â Â  the existence of similar past conduct;\r\n(8)Â Â Â Â  likelihood the award will deter the defendant \r\n  or others from like conduct;\r\n(9)Â Â Â Â  whether the award is reasonably related to \r\n  the harm likely to result from such conduct; and\r\n(10)Â Â  defendantâ€™s wealth or ability to pay.\r\n\r\nSee Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, \r\n  406 S.E.2d 350 (1991); see also Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, \r\n  306, 536 S.E.2d 408, 422 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œUnder Gamble, the trial court \r\n  is not required to make findings of fact for each factor to uphold a punitive \r\n  damage award.â€).\r\nThis Court must affirm the trial courtâ€™s punitive damages \r\n  finding for the Respondents if any evidence reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s \r\n  factual findings.Â  See Carjow, LLC v. Simmons, 349 S.C. 514, 563 \r\n  S.E.2d 359 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A factual question as to punitive damages is presented \r\n  when there is evidence of a statutory violation.Â  See Wise v. Broadway, \r\n  315 S.C. 273, 433 S.E.2d 857 (1993).\r\n The trial court found Appellantâ€™s agent \r\n  violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-5-2330(b) \r\n  [3]  and -2740 [4]  (1991) \r\n  by failing to stop and yield the right of way to Respondentsâ€™ vehicle.Â  The \r\n  evidence in the record, which shows Appellantâ€™s vehicle did not stop at the \r\n  stop sign but entered the intersection and struck Respondentsâ€™ car, clearly \r\n  supports this finding.Â  â€œThe causative violation of a statute constitutes negligence \r\n  per se and is evidence of recklessness and willfulness, requiring the submission \r\n  of the issue of punitive damages to the jury.â€Â  Wise, 315 S.C. at 276, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  at 859.Â  Violation of a statute does not constitute recklessness, willfulness, \r\n  and wantonness per se, but is some evidence the defendant acted recklessly, \r\n  willfully, and wantonly.Â  Id.Â  The jury determines whether a party has been \r\n  reckless, willful, and wanton.Â  Id. at 277, 433 S.E.2d at 859.Â  However, even \r\n  in cases involving disputed liability, punitive damages are sustainable if there \r\n  is any evidence supporting a violation of a statute.Â  See, e.g., id. (evidence \r\n  of a violation of an applicable statute is a proper basis for submitting punitive \r\n  damages to the trial jury); Bethea v. Pedro Land, Inc., 290 S.C. 341, 350 S.E.2d \r\n  392 (Ct. App. 1986) (affirming finding of punitive damages in automobile accident \r\n  where record contained evidence from which the jury could draw inferences of \r\n  gross negligence).Â  Because the evidence supports the trial judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  that Appellantâ€™s agent violated a statute, we find it was proper to award punitive \r\n  damages to Respondents.\r\nAppellant claims the punitive damage awards were based on improper \r\n  considerations by the trial judge.Â  Appellant did not raise this argument at \r\n  trial.Â  Instead, Appellant raised this issue for the first time on appeal.Â  \r\n  This Court cannot address an issue not raised to the trial court.Â  See \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt \r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but \r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for \r\n  appellate review.â€).Â  Therefore, we decline to address whether the punitive \r\n  damage awards were based on improper considerations.\r\nC.Â  Punitive Damages\r\nThe trial court awarded $2,158,000 in punitive damages \r\n  to Joseph and $442,000 to Sandra.Â  We find the amount of punitive damages awarded \r\n  to Sandra and Joseph was proper.\r\nThe Appellant, in its brief, does NOT analyze \r\n  the issue of actual damages as compared to punitive damages.Â  Rather, the Appellant, \r\n  in a confusing and erroneous analysis states:\r\n\r\nJoseph Austin was ultimately awarded $850,000.00 \r\n  in actual damages, as well as the sum of $2,158,000.00 in punitive damages.Â  \r\n  The testimony at the damages hearing averred that Mr. Austin had incurred total \r\n  medical damages of $79,810.62 as of August 14, 2002.Â  There was further testimony \r\n  that future medical expenses could total as much as $90,200.00, for a total \r\n  of $170,010.62.\r\nThe award of $850,000.00 actual damages is \r\n  approximately 5 times the total figure of present and future medical expenses.Â  \r\n  Taking the $2,158,000.00 in punitives per the trial courtâ€™s order, the total \r\n  damages awarded Joseph Austin are more than 17 times the total medicals (present \r\n  and future).\r\nThe Respondents provide little clarity in \r\n  their brief:\r\nEven if this Court were to analyze the Austinsâ€™ \r\n  punitive damage awards in terms of a multiple of their respective actual damages, \r\n  this Court should still affirm the punitive damage awards.Â  Josephâ€™s punitive \r\n  award is only 12.8 times his actual damages award and Sandraâ€™s punitive damage \r\n  award is only a little over two times her actual damages award.\r\n\r\nIn contrariety to the mathematical comparisons \r\n  presented by the Appellant and Respondents in their respective briefs, we calculate \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) JOSEPHâ€™S PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD IS 2.54 TIMES HIS \r\n  ACTUAL DAMAGE AWARD.\r\n(2) SANDRAâ€™S PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD IS 2.5 TIMES HER \r\n  ACTUAL DAMAGE AWARD.\r\n\r\nIn Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  408 (Ct. App. 2000), this Court highlighted the case history regarding the determination \r\n  of whether punitive damages comport with due process:\r\n\r\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \r\n  prohibits states from imposing grossly excessive punishments on tortfeasors.Â  \r\n  BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 809 (1996).Â  In Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. \r\n  1, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), the Supreme Court determined whether \r\n  the Due Process Clause rendered a punitive damages award unconstitutional.Â  \r\n  The Court noted â€œunlimited jury discretionâ€”or unlimited judicial discretion \r\n  for that matterâ€”in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results \r\n  that jar oneâ€™s constitutional sensibilities.â€ Id. at 18, 111 S.Ct. at \r\n  1043, 113 L.Ed.2d at 20.Â  In Haslip, the Court upheld the punitive damages \r\n  award, finding Alabamaâ€™s post-trial procedures for scrutinizing such awards \r\n  and its appellate review â€œmakes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable \r\n  in their amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred \r\n  and to deter its repetition.â€Â  Id. at 21, 111 S.Ct. at 1045, 113 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 22.\r\nIn response to Haslip, the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court, in Gamble, supra, developed an eight factor post-verdict \r\n  review which trial courts are required to conduct to determine if a punitive \r\n  damages award comports with due process.Â  The Gamble factors are:\r\n  \r\n(1) defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) duration \r\n  of the conduct; (3) defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence \r\n  of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or \r\n  others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the \r\n  harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and \r\n  finally, (8) as noted in Haslip, â€œother factorsâ€ deemed appropriate.\r\n  \r\nGamble, 305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354.Â  \r\n  Under Gamble, the trial court is not required to make findings of fact \r\n  for each factor to uphold a punitive damage award.Â  McGee v. Bruce Hosp. \r\n  Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996).\r\n\r\nWelch, 342 S.C at 305-06, 536 S.E.2d at 422.\r\nThe trial judge is vested with considerable discretion \r\n  over the amount of a punitive damage award.Â  See Kuznik v. Bees Ferry \r\n  Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 538 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  This Courtâ€™s review \r\n  of the amount of punitive damages is limited to correction of errors of law.Â  \r\n  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love Chevrolet, Inc., 324 \r\n  S.C. 149, 478 S.E.2d 57 (1996).\r\nThe trial court awarded Joseph punitive damages that \r\n  are approximately 2.54 times his actual damages.Â  In State Farm Mut. Auto. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (2003), the United States \r\n  Supreme Court, in discussing punitive damages, stated:\r\n\r\n[W]e have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional \r\n  limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the \r\n  punitive damages award.Â  We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which \r\n  a punitive damages award cannot exceed.Â  Our jurisprudence and the principles \r\n  it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding \r\n  a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant \r\n  degree, will satisfy due process.\r\n\r\n123 S.Ct. at 1524 (citation omitted).Â  In Pacific \r\n  Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1 (1991), the Court found that an \r\n  award greater than four times the amount of compensatory damages was approaching \r\n  the line of constitutional impropriety.Â  Id. at 23-24.Â  Thereafter, the \r\n  Court, in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), cited \r\n  the 4-to-1 ratio again, looking to a long legislative history dating back 700 \r\n  years that provided for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple punitive damages.Â  \r\n  Id. at 581.Â  The Campbell Court inculcated: â€œWhile these ratios \r\n  are not binding, they are instructive.Â  They demonstrate what should be obvious: \r\n  Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while \r\n  still achieving the Stateâ€™s goals of deterrence and retribution . . . .â€Â  Campbell, \r\n  123 S.Ct. at 1524.\r\nUtilizing Gamble, Welch, and \r\n  Campbell, the punitive damage award in each instance is a single-digit \r\n  multiplier and comports with due process.\r\nThe punitive damage award to Joseph, which was approximately \r\n  2.54 times his actual damage award, was NOT excessive.Â  The punitive damage \r\n  award to Sandra, which was approximately 2.5 times her actual damage award, \r\n  was NOT excessive.\r\nII.Â  APPELLANTâ€™S \r\n  LIABILITY FOR AGENTâ€™S TORTS\r\nRespondents sued Appellant under a respondeat superior \r\n  theory.Â  Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the employer is liable for \r\n  the acts of an employee acting within the scope of employment.Â  South Carolina \r\n  Ins. Co. v. James C. Greene &amp; Co., 290 S.C. 171, 348 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. \r\n  1986).Â  Appellant never contested Respondentsâ€™ allegation that the driver of \r\n  Appellantâ€™s truck was an employee of Appellant and was acting within the scope \r\n  of his employment when the accident occurred.Â  In fact, Appellant admitted this \r\n  allegation upon entry of default.Â  â€œIt is well settled that by suffering a default, \r\n  the defaulting party is deemed to have admitted the truth of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  allegations and to have conceded liability.â€Â  Roche v. Young Bros. Inc., 332 \r\n  S.C. 75, 81, 504 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1998).\r\nAdditionally, Respondents were not required to \r\n  sue both principal and agent to recover from the principal under respondeat \r\n  superior.Â  See Lane v. Home Ins. Co., 190 S.C. 84, 2 S.E.2d 30 (1939).Â  They \r\n  had the choice to sue either the agent or principal or join both.Â  See Lane, \r\n  190 S.C. at 91, 2 S.E.2d at 32.Â  Because the truck driver was acting within \r\n  the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, the trial judge properly \r\n  found Appellant liable for the driverâ€™s torts.\r\nAppellant maintains the trial court erred in awarding \r\n  damages based on the actions of the driver because the driver was previously \r\n  dismissed as a party to this action.Â  Appellant cites two cases to support its \r\n  argumentâ€”Kirby v. Gulf Ref. Co., 173 S.C. 224, 175 S.E. 535 (1934), and Collins \r\n  v. Johnson, 245 S.C. 215, 139 S.E.2d 915 (1965).Â  Appellantâ€™s reliance on these \r\n  cases is misplaced.Â  These cases only stand for the proposition that, when a \r\n  principal and servant are sued together, a principal is not responsible for \r\n  punitive damages under respondeat superior when the agent was exonerated from \r\n  liability.Â  In the instant case, the truck driver was dismissed as a party to \r\n  the case, not exonerated from liability.Â  Concomitantly, Appellantâ€™s argument \r\n  fails.\r\nIII.Â  APPLICATION OF RULE 54(c), SCRCP\r\nAppellant asserts the trial court erred in refusing to alter or amend the damages \r\n  award based on Rule 54(c), SCRCP.Â  Rule 54(c) provides â€œ[a] judgment by default \r\n  shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the \r\n  demand for judgment.â€Â  Appellant argues Respondentsâ€™ complaint limits the damages \r\n  in the case, and therefore, the trial court erred when it granted Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  motion to open the judgment to amend the complaint to delete any prayer for \r\n  a specific sum.Â  We decline to address this issue.Â  Appellant did not appeal \r\n  the ruling by the trial judge that granted the motion to open the judgment.Â  \r\n  A portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination \r\n  by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case.Â  \r\n  Greenville Cty. v. Kenwood Enters., Inc., 353 S.C. 157, 577 S.E.2d 428 \r\n  (2003).Â  Thus, allowing the complaint to be amended to delete any prayer for \r\n  a specific sum is the law of the case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the trial court did not err in the amount \r\n  of actual damages awarded to Respondents.Â  We hold the amount of punitive damages \r\n  awarded to Sandra and Joseph was proper.Â  The trial court properly concluded \r\n  Appellant was liable for the torts committed by its agent.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  decision of the trial judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Respondents later voluntarily dismissed their claims against Bishop.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    S.C.
