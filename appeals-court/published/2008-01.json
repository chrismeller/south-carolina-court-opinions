Greene,Â  of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tVincent C. Northcutt and Jason A. Williams, both of Charleston,\r\n  for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: This\r\n  action originated from a workersâ€™ compensation claim filed by Tony Jones\r\n  (Jones) against his employer, Harold Arnoldâ€™s Sentry Buick, Pontiac, GMC\r\n  (Employer).Â  Jones argues the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission (Appellate Panel) improperly concluded Employer established the\r\n  defense of intoxication.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJones\r\n  asserted he suffered compensable injuries to his back and lower extremities as\r\n  a result of two falls that occurred on May 20 and May 21, 2004.Â  At the time of\r\n  his alleged injuries, Jones was a car salesman for Employer.\r\nJones\r\n  acknowledged an addiction to cocaine.Â  Jones admitted to using cocaine on May\r\n  16 and May 17, 2004.Â  However, Jones denied using cocaine on the dates of his\r\n  falls.Â   \r\nPrior to his alleged injuries, Jones voluntarily began counseling\r\n  with Kevin Shea, a certified addictions counselor.Â  On May 19, 2004, one day\r\n  prior to Jonesâ€™ first fall, Shea and Jones had a one-hour counseling session.Â \r\n  According to Shea, Jones did not exhibit any signs of being under the influence\r\n  of cocaine at this session.Â  However, Shea admitted he did not meet with Jones\r\n  on the dates of the falls, and therefore, Shea could not determine if Jones was\r\n  under the influence of cocaine during those days.Â  On the date of Jonesâ€™ first\r\n  fall, May 20, 2004, Jones tested positive for cocaine.Â   \r\nIn denying a compensable injury had occurred, Employer sought to\r\n  establish the affirmative defense of intoxication pursuant to S.C. Code Section\r\n  42-9-60 (Supp. 2006).Â  The Single Commissioner found Jones was intoxicated at\r\n  the time of his falls.Â  In so doing, the Single Commissioner specifically\r\n  concluded Jonesâ€™ testimony was not credible at either the hearing or at his\r\n  deposition.Â  The Single Commissioner further found Employerâ€™s witnessesâ€™\r\n  testimony to be more credible than Jonesâ€™ witnessesâ€™ testimony.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel affirmed the Single Commissioner in full as did the circuit court.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the\r\n  Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304,\r\n  306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, neither this Court nor the\r\n  circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C.\r\n  613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â   \r\nâ€œAny\r\n  review of the [C]ommissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial\r\n  evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511,\r\n  515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Accordingly, we limit review to\r\n  deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is supported by substantial evidence\r\n  or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571\r\n  S.E.2d at 95.  \r\nâ€œSubstantial\r\n  evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached.â€Â  Lockridge, 344 S.C. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.Â  â€œThe possibility of\r\n  drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\n  administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJones\r\n  argues substantial evidence does not support the conclusion he was intoxicated\r\n  at the time of his falls.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nGenerally,\r\n  the fault of an employee in a workersâ€™ compensation claim has no bearing on the\r\n  employeeâ€™s right to recover.Â  Zeigler v. S.C. Law Enforcement Div., 250\r\n  S.C. 326, 329, 157 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1967).Â  Section 42-9-60 makes an exception\r\n  to this general rule and states, â€œNo compensation shall be payable if the\r\n  injury . . . was occasioned by the intoxication of the employee . . . .â€Â  \r\n \r\nIntoxication\r\n  is a condition that results from the use of a stimulant, which renders\r\n  an employee impaired in his or her faculties to the extent that the employee is\r\n  incapable of carrying on the accustomed work without danger to the employee.Â  Reeves\r\n    v. Carolina Foundry &amp; Mach. Works, 194 S.C. 403, 408, 9 S.E.2d 919, 921\r\n  (1940).Â  Intoxication is an affirmative defense which requires\r\n  the party asserting the defense to carry the burden of proof.Â  Chandler v. Suitt Constr. Co., 288 S.C. 503, 504, 343 S.E.2d 633, 634 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  record is replete with testimony that requires this Court to conclude\r\n  substantial evidence exists to affirm the Appellate Panel.Â  On May 20, 2004,\r\n  the date of the first fall, Jones tested positive for cocaine.Â  Dr. Demi\r\n  Garvin, a toxicologist, testified the positive result was consistent with Jones\r\n  using cocaine on May 20, 2004.Â   \r\nDr.\r\n  Garvin further testified that cocaine use can result in red and glassy eyes,\r\n  slurred speech, and risk-taking behavior.Â  Dr. James Ballenger, a psychiatrist\r\n  with an expertise in substance abuse, testified that an individual under the\r\n  influence of cocaine exhibits the following signs: anxiety, memory loss,\r\n  clumsiness, slurred speech, red puffy eyes, and eyes darting back and forth.Â  \r\n \r\nLeslie\r\n  Wise, a parts manager for Employer, testified she immediately went to Jones\r\n  after Jonesâ€™ fall on May 20, 2004.Â  When asked if she noticed anything unusual\r\n  about Jonesâ€™ appearance, Wise responded, â€œYes.Â  I actually noticed his eyes\r\n  were, I say, dancing.Â  They were just moving . . . fast . . . just jumping\r\n  around.â€Â  Michael Dickey, a general sales manager for Employer, testified Jones\r\n  slurred his speech on May 20 and May 21, 2004, the dates of Jonesâ€™ first and\r\n  second falls.Â  Dickey also stated Jonesâ€™ eyes were glassy, red, and swollen on\r\n  May 20 and May 21, 2004.  \r\nWe\r\n  are cognizant of the fact that Jones produced witnesses on his behalf.Â  For\r\n  example, Robert Strong testified on behalf of Jones.Â  The parties were\r\n  acquainted with each other because both belonged to the same church.Â  On May\r\n  19, 2004, one day prior to Jonesâ€™ first fall, Strong was attempting to purchase\r\n  a vehicle from Jones.Â  Strong, along with Jones, took the prospective vehicle\r\n  for a test drive.Â  During this drive, Jones and Strong decided to have lunch.Â  \r\n \r\nÂ When\r\n  asked whether Strong observed anything unusual about Jones, Strong responded in\r\n  the negative.Â  Strong further stated Jones did not have red, swollen, or glassy\r\n  eyes on that day.Â  Strong also noted he had no difficulty in understanding\r\n  Jones.Â  However, the meeting between Strong and Jones occurred on May 19, 2004,\r\n  one day prior to Jonesâ€™ first fall.Â  Thus, it is possible for Jones to have\r\n  ingested cocaine after his meeting with Strong but prior to his fall.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the Single Commissioner found Jonesâ€™ and his witnessesâ€™ testimony less credible\r\n  than Employerâ€™s and Employerâ€™s witnessesâ€™ testimony.Â  See Lee,\r\n  350 S.C. at 78, 564 S.E.2d at 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œThe possibility of drawing\r\n  two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\n  administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€)\r\n  (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nANDERSON\r\n  AND SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4329","title":"James v.

Settana, Jr. and J. Eric Kaufmann, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Isiah James, Jr., brought this action against the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and\r\n  Pardon Services (the Department) alleging he was improperly denied parole and\r\n  that the Departmentâ€™s decision to allow him a parole review every two years rather\r\n  than each year constituted an ex post facto violation.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment to the Department, finding James had stated no viable\r\n  claim for relief and that the Departmentâ€™s review procedure did not constitute\r\n  an ex post facto violation.Â  James appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nI.\r\nJames\r\n  was convicted in 1979 of two counts of voluntary manslaughter and one count of\r\n  armed robbery.Â  The offenses were committed in 1978.Â  He received consecutive\r\n  sentences of thirty years in prison for each manslaughter charge and a\r\n  consecutive sentence of twenty-five years for the robbery charge.Â  James\r\n  brought this current action against the Department alleging he was improperly\r\n  denied parole after a hearing in 2005.Â  The Department moved for summary\r\n  judgment, asserting, among other things, that James presented no claim for\r\n  relief.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found no merit to Jamesâ€™s claim regarding the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  decision not to grant him parole and affirmed the Departmentâ€™s decision that\r\n  James was not entitled to a parole hearing every year rather than every two\r\n  years.Â  In granting summary judgment to the Department, the court found James\r\n  failed to state a cause of action and had not established the Department\r\n  committed an ex post facto violation in its decision to conduct parole hearings\r\n  every two years.Â  In addition, the court found Jamesâ€™s claims were barred by\r\n  the doctrine of res judicata and several provisions of the South Carolina Tort\r\n  Claims Act.Â  James appeals, arguing the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\n  judgment to the Department.\r\nII.\r\nUnder\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court may determine\r\n  summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences\r\n  which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter,&nbsp;328 S.C.\r\n  36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58&nbsp;(1997).\r\nIII. \r\nOn appeal, James asserts the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to the Department on the grounds that he did not have\r\n  an absolute right to parole and he had shown no ex post facto violation.[2]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court determined James failed to state a cause of action for relief\r\n  because inmates have no protected right to parole, only the right to a parole\r\n  hearing, citing Furtick v. South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole,\r\n    and Pardon Services, 352 S.C. 594, 576 S.E.2d 146 (2003).Â  The circuit\r\n  court stated a claim regarding the failure to grant parole, as opposed to a\r\n  claim that an inmate has been declared permanently ineligible for\r\n  parole, is not reviewable.Â  The court additionally found that, even if this\r\n  were a situation involving a determination that James was permanently\r\n  ineligible for parole, the proper procedure under Al-Shabazz v. State,\r\n  338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000) would have been to submit this action to\r\n  the Administrative Law Court (ALC), not the circuit court.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nIn Furtick,\r\n  our supreme court held the ALC[3] had jurisdiction to hear a defendantâ€™s appeal from the Departmentâ€™s decision\r\n  finding him ineligible for parole.Â  352 S.C. at 597-98, 576 S.E.2d at 148-49.Â \r\n  The court concluded that an inmate has a liberty interest in gaining access to the parole board, although there is no protected right to parole.Â  The court\r\n  explained, â€œIn our opinion, the permanent denial of parole eligibility implicates a liberty interest sufficient to require at least minimal due\r\n  process.â€Â  Id. at 598, 576 S.E.2d at 149.Â  The court observed section\r\n  24-21-620 of the South Carolina Code[4] generally provides for review for parole, but noted as follows:Â  â€œAlthough this\r\n  provision creates a liberty interest in parole eligibility, it does not create\r\n  a liberty interest in parole.â€Â  Id. at 598 n.4, 576 S.E.2d at 149 n.4; see\r\n    also Sullivan v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437,\r\n  443 n.4, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 n.4 (2003) (noting parole is a privilege, not a\r\n  right).Â   \r\nIn Al-Shabazz\r\n  v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), an inmate brought a\r\n  post-conviction relief action contesting a decision by the Department of\r\n  Corrections to take away his good-time credits.Â  Id. at 361, 527 S.E.2d\r\n  at 745.Â  Our supreme court held that the proper procedure an inmate should\r\n  follow is to seek review of the agencyâ€™s decision by the ALC, following the\r\n  terms of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).[5]Â  Id. at 369, 527 S.E.2d at 750.Â  Further, in Sullivan, the court\r\n  stated that an inmate has a right of review by the ALC that he is ineligible\r\n  for parole.Â  355 S.C. 437, 443 &amp; n.4, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 &amp; n.4. Â Â \r\nThus,\r\n  we hold the circuit court correctly found James did not present a viable claim\r\n  regarding the Departmentâ€™s decision to deny him parole as the denial of parole\r\n  is not a cognizable claim.Â  In addition, James should have followed the\r\n  procedures outlined in Al-Shabazz for review of his claims.\r\nLikewise,\r\n  we similarly reject Jamesâ€™s contention that the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  he failed to establish the Department committed an ex post facto violation by denying\r\n  him annual parole reviews.Â   \r\nIn Steele\r\n  v. Benjamin, 362 S.C. 66, 606 S.E.2d 499 (Ct. App. 2004), an action\r\n  involving a request for a writ of mandamus, we held, as an additional\r\n  sustaining ground to support the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of Steeleâ€™s claim,\r\n  that an administrative law judge should have reviewed Steeleâ€™s claim.Â  We\r\n  stated, â€œSteeleâ€™s complaint that the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  application of biannual parole review to him constituted an ex post facto\r\n  violation, potentially lengthening&nbsp;the period of his incarceration by one\r\n  year, implicated a liberty interest.â€&nbsp; Id. at 73, 606 S.E.2d at\r\n  503.Â  We observed that the ALC has jurisdiction to review matters that\r\n  implicate a liberty interest, and that a non-collateral matter such as an ex\r\n  post facto claim should be subject to administrative review under the terms of\r\n  the APA.&nbsp; Id. at 72, 606 S.E.2d at 502-03.Â  Accordingly, we hold\r\n  Jamesâ€™s ex post facto claim should have been brought before the ALC.Â  &nbsp; \r\n \r\nWe further agree with the circuit court that James did not\r\n  establish an ex post facto violation, in any event.Â  â€œAn ex post facto violation occurs when a change in\r\n  the law retroactively alters the definition of a crime or increases the\r\n  punishment for a crime.â€Â  Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 261, 531\r\n  S.E.2d 507, 509 (2000).Â  In Jernigan, our supreme court held that the\r\n  retroactive application of a state statute (section 24-21-645 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code) changing reviews for parole eligibility for violent offenders\r\n  from annual to biannual constitutes an ex post facto violation.Â  Id. at 264-66, 531 S.E.2d at 511-12.Â  The court noted, â€œThe law existing at the time\r\n  of the offense determines whether an increase of punishment constitutes an ex\r\n  post facto violation.â€Â  Id. at 261 n.3, 531 S.E.2d at 509 n.3.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn finding\r\n  there was no ex post facto violation, the circuit court rejected Jamesâ€™s\r\n  contention that the Department was retroactively applying section 24-21-645 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code[6] to allow him parole reviews only every two years instead of each year. Â The\r\n  circuit court noted section 24-21-645, which changed parole hearings for\r\n  violent offenders from annual to biannual reviews, was enacted in 1986.Â  The\r\n  court stated that at the time Jamesâ€™s crimes were committed in 1978, there was\r\n  no statute governing the frequency of parole hearings.Â  Rather, the frequency\r\n  of parole hearings was a matter determined by the Departmentâ€™s own policy.Â  At\r\n  the time of Jamesâ€™s crimes, the Departmentâ€™s policy called for reviews every\r\n  two years for prisoners serving sentences of thirty years of more.Â  The court\r\n  noted it was not until 1981, several years after Jamesâ€™s crimes, that another\r\n  statute, section 24-21-620, was amended to provide for annual parole reviews.Â \r\n  This provision is now limited to nonviolent offenders.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the circuit court that, because James remains subject to biannual\r\n  parole reviews, as was the law in 1978, there is no ex post facto violation in\r\n  this case.Â  The Department is simply applying the law in effect at the time\r\n  James committed his crimes, not retroactively applying section 24-21-645.Â  See Elmore v. State, 305 S.C. 456, 409 S.E.2d 397 (1991) (stating the law\r\n  existing at the time of the offense, not at the time of sentencing, determines\r\n  whether an ex post facto violation has occurred), overruled on other grounds\r\n    by Al-Shabazz v.

Foggie, Sr. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming in\r\n  part the order of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, but also\r\n  remanding two matters to the Commission. We find the interlocutory order of the\r\n  circuit court is not immediately appealable, and therefore dismiss this appeal.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFoggie\r\n  began working for General Electric around 1967.Â  On June 19, 2000, while\r\n  working as a machine operator, he was injured when a wrench he was using to\r\n  tighten a bolt slipped, causing him to fall.Â  Foggie sought benefits for\r\n  injuries to his back, neck, right shoulder, right upper extremity, and psyche\r\n  as a result of the accident, and claimed he was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled.Â  General Electric admitted Foggie suffered an injury by accident to\r\n  his right shoulder, but denied related injury to any other body part or system\r\n  and denied Foggie was permanently and totally disabled.Â   \r\nBy\r\n  order dated November 23, 2004, the Single Commissioner found Foggie sustained a\r\n  compensable injury to his back, right upper extremity, and psyche, and that he\r\n  was permanently and totally disabled â€œas a result of his injury by accident;\r\n  the combination of his related physical and psychological injuries, restrictions,\r\n  and limitations; and his inability to return to any work and complete loss of\r\n  earning capacity.â€Â  In reaching this determination, the Commissioner found it\r\n  was the opinion of Dr. Tollison that claimant was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled as a result of the combination of the physical and psychological\r\n  injuries caused by the injury by accident.Â  The Commissioner also noted Foggie\r\n  had received a prior workersâ€™ compensation award with General Electric\r\n  involving an injury to another part of his body, but found there was no\r\n  evidence concerning the amount of the disability and therefore General Electric\r\n  was not entitled to any credit for previous permanent partial disability\r\n  benefits paid for that claim.Â  While the Commissioner found Foggie suffered\r\n  from preexisting post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service with\r\n  the military in Vietnam, no finding was made as to General Electricâ€™s\r\n  entitlement to any credit for Foggieâ€™s previous disability assessment by the\r\n  Veteranâ€™s Administration.Â   \r\nGeneral\r\n  Electric appealed to the Appellate Panel contending, among other things, the\r\n  Single Commissioner erred in finding Foggie suffered an injury to his psyche,\r\n  finding Foggie was totally and permanently disabled, failing to award General\r\n  Electric credit for a prior 10% award in a previous workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  claim, and failing to give General Electric credit for a 30% award Foggie\r\n  previously received from the Veterans Administration.Â Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n  found Foggie sustained a compensable injury to his psyche and that he was\r\n  permanently and totally disabled, but determined General Electric was entitled\r\n  to credit for a previous 10% workersâ€™ compensation award involving Foggieâ€™s\r\n  leg.Â  While the Appellate Panel found Foggie suffered from preexisting post-traumatic\r\n  stress disorder as a result of his military service, it made no finding\r\n  regarding whether General Electric was entitled to any credit for this previous\r\n  disability.Â  The Appellate Panel, like the Single Commissioner, found Dr.\r\n  Tollison opined that Foggie was permanently and totally disabled as a result of\r\n  the combination of the physical and psychological injuries caused by the injury\r\n  by accident.Â   \r\nGeneral\r\n  Electric appealed to the circuit court, asserting the Commission erred in (1)\r\n  finding Foggie sustained an injury to his psyche, (2) finding Foggie was\r\n  entitled to permanent total disability benefits as a result of his injuries,\r\n  and (3) failing to grant General Electric a credit for a 30% disability\r\n  assessed by the Veterans Administration.Â  Foggie also appealed, contending the\r\n  Commission erred in granting General Electric credit for 10% loss of use of\r\n  Foggieâ€™s lower extremity as a result of a previous accident.Â  The circuit court\r\n  affirmed the Commissionâ€™s findings that Foggie sustained injury to his psyche\r\n  and that General Electric was entitled to a 10% credit for the prior workersâ€™\r\n  compensation award for Foggieâ€™s leg.Â  However, it remanded on the issue of\r\n  permanent total disability, as well as that of credit for the 30% psychological\r\n  disability.Â  The court found the Commission, in making its determination on\r\n  permanent total disability, considered a statement from Dr. Tollison which was\r\n  to have been excluded from the record.Â  The court thus remanded the case to the Commission with\r\n  instructions to review the record without considering the excluded material and\r\n  to determine whether its findings and conclusions should be altered in any way.Â  The circuit court remanded the issue of the 30%\r\n  disability assessed by the Veterans Administration for Foggieâ€™s combat-related\r\n  post-traumatic stress disorder, finding the Commission made â€œabsolutely no\r\n  ruling and no findings of any kindâ€ on the issue, and instructed the Commission\r\n  to review the record and applicable law and make specific findings concerning\r\n  General Electricâ€™s entitlement to the claimed credit.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFoggie\r\n  asserts the circuit court erred in (1) failing to find substantial evidence\r\n  supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that he is entitled to permanent total\r\n  disability compensation benefits, (2) affirming the Commissionâ€™s finding that\r\n  General Electric is entitled to credit for an unrelated award of 10% permanent\r\n  partial disability to Foggieâ€™s leg, and (3) failing to reject General\r\n  Electricâ€™s claimed credit for Foggieâ€™s alleged service-related disability.Â \r\n  General Electric contends, however, the order of the circuit court is\r\n  interlocutory and therefore not directly appealable.Â  We agree with General\r\n  Electric, and thus dismiss this appeal.\r\nAppellate\r\n  review of workersâ€™ compensation decisions is governed by the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act.Â  Geathers v. 3V, Inc., 371 S.C. 570, 576, 641 S.E.2d 29,\r\n  32 (2007).Â  Pursuant to section 1-23-390 of the South Carolina Code, â€œAn\r\n  aggrieved party may obtain a review of a final judgment of the circuit\r\n  court or the court of appeals pursuant to this article by taking an appeal in\r\n  the manner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules as in other\r\n  civil cases.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-390 (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added).Â  Thus,\r\n  our courts, â€œhave consistently held that an order of the circuit court\r\n  remanding a case for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is\r\n  not directly appealable.â€Â  Montjoy v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C.\r\n  52, 52, 446 S.E.2d 618, 618 (1994).Â  See also Davis v. La-Z-Boy Chair\r\n    Co., 287 S.C. 121, 122, 337 S.E.2d 238, 239 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding an\r\n  appeal from a circuit court order remanding a workersâ€™ compensation case for\r\n  the purpose of making specific findings of fact is interlocutory and not\r\n  reviewable by the court of appeals); Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C.\r\n  491, 491-92, 316 S.E.2d 385, 385 (1984) (holding the order of the circuit court\r\n  did not involve the merits of the action and was therefore interlocutory and\r\n  not reviewable by the supreme court for lack of finality); Hunt v. Whitt,\r\n  279 S.C. 343, 343, 306 S.E.2d 621, 622 (1983) (holding interlocutory order of\r\n  the circuit court remanding the workersâ€™ compensation matter for taking\r\n  additional medical evidence did not involve the merits of the action and therefore\r\n  was not reviewable by the court for lack of finality).\r\nOur\r\n  courts have recognized that, in some situations, remand orders from the circuit\r\n  court to the Commission may be immediately appealable.Â  In Brown v. Greenwood\r\n    Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied (Jan. 31, 2007), this court found the circuit courtâ€™s order finally determined\r\n  the issue on the merits - - that the employeeâ€™s smoking contributed to his\r\n  disability - - and that the remand by the circuit court determined with\r\n  finality whether there would be a reduction in compensation, only leaving the\r\n  determination of the percentage of apportionment for the Commission.Â  Id. at 387-88, 622 S.E.2d at 551. Â Accordingly, where the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  constitutes a final decision on the merits and the remand order has no effect\r\n  on the finality of the decision, the order is immediately appealable.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the case at hand, we find the circuit court order remanding the two issues\r\n  to the Commission is not a final decision on the merits and the order therefore\r\n  is not immediately appealable.Â  The circuit court did not make a final\r\n  determination regarding whether or not Foggie was totally and permanently\r\n  disabled, but remanded the matter for reconsideration by the Commission without\r\n  reliance on the evidence that had been excluded from the record.Â  The court\r\n  likewise did not make a final determination of whether General Electric was\r\n  entitled to a credit for a previous Veterans Administration disability award to\r\n  Foggie, but remanded the matter to the Commission to review the record and\r\n  applicable law and make specific findings as to any entitlement to credit\r\n  General Electric might have.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  do not find persuasive Foggieâ€™s argument that the order is immediately\r\n  appealable because the remand was unnecessary inasmuch as there is substantial\r\n  evidence supporting the permanent total disability issue and General Electric\r\n  is not entitled to a credit for the Veterans Administration disability as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  Both of these issues are clearly matters within the purview of\r\n  the Commission, not the circuit court or this court sitting in an appellate\r\n  capacity.Â  For in workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the\r\n  ultimate finder of fact, and final determination of witness credibility and the\r\n  weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel. Â Shealy\r\n    v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  Because\r\n  these issues have not been properly considered by the Commission, the\r\n  Commission having included admittedly excluded evidence on one and having\r\n  failed to make any findings whatsoever on the other, the circuit court was\r\n  correct in remanding the matters to the Commission.Â  See Baldwin v.\r\n    James River Corp., 304 S.C. 485, 487, 405 S.E.2d 421, 422-23 (Ct. App. 1991)\r\n  (wherein the court of appeals remanded the case to the workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  commission because the commission made insufficient findings of fact so as to\r\n  permit appellate review of the commissionâ€™s decision denying an award); Drake\r\n    v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 116, 124, 127 S.E.2d 288, 292-93\r\n  (1962), overruled on other grounds, Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343,\r\n  306 S.E.2d 621 (1983) (holding remand proper on circuit courtâ€™s own motion in a\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation case where the commission failed to make essential\r\n  findings of fact because â€œ[t]o hold otherwise would in such cases make the\r\n  determination of the rights of the parties turn upon the neglect of the\r\n  Commission to make essential findings of fact, or require the appellate court\r\n  to make the omitted findings of fact which our statute forbidsâ€).\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the appeal in this matter is  \r\nDISMISSED.[2]\r\nCURETON,\r\n  AJ., concurs.Â Â Â Â   \r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nPIEPER, J., dissenting:  \r\nRespectfully,\r\n  I dissent. Â I would hold that the circuit courtâ€™s order is subject to appellate\r\n  review.\r\nIn the case sub\r\n  judice, the circuit court finally determined an issue on the merits by\r\n  affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusion that General Electric was entitled\r\n  to a 10% credit for a previous workersâ€™ compensation award involving Foggieâ€™s\r\n  leg.Â  Thus, the circuit court did not merely remand for further proceedings,\r\n  but finally determined the defense of set-off or credit that ultimately will be\r\n  binding on the parties and the Commission on remand.\r\nIn Brown v.\r\n  Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2007), this\r\n  court determined that the claimantâ€™s smoking contributed to his disability.Â \r\n  The circuit court remanded to make findings as to the apportionment percentage\r\n  with a corresponding reduction in the claimantâ€™s disability award.Â  Although\r\n  the circuit court left the percentage of apportionment up to the Commission on\r\n  remand, this court nonetheless indicated that the panel would have no choice\r\n  but to allocate some part of the disability to a noncompensable cause and thus\r\n  held that the circuit courtâ€™s order constituted a final decision on the issue\r\n  of apportionment and was appealable.Â  Ultimately, the court reversed the order\r\n  of the circuit court on the apportionment issue.  \r\nHere the question\r\n  of the 10% credit or the amount thereof is no longer subject to review on\r\n  remand although potentially affected by the proceedings on remand.Â  While the\r\n  majority opinion correctly notes that the credit for the Veterans Administration\r\n  matter is not final, the majority does not address the final decision on the\r\n  credit issue as to Foggieâ€™s leg, which credit is unrelated to the Veterans\r\n  Administration matter.Â  I greatly respect the concerns of the majority for\r\n  judicial economy.Â  However, even if judicial economy is considered, I would\r\n  respectfully note that if the defense of set-off or credit is reviewed after\r\n  remand, then it is just as likely that the matter would be sent back again to\r\n  the Commission if that defense is ultimately overturned or modified which\r\n  weighs against those notions of judicial economy. Accordingly, I would hold\r\n  that determination by the circuit court regarding the 10% credit constitutes a\r\n  final decision on the defense of set-off or credit and is immediately\r\n  appealable.Â   \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We take no position on the remaining issues in\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  As previously noted, our courts have consistently\r\n  held that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional\r\n  proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.Â  Montjoy,\r\n  316 S.C. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618 (1994).Â  Additionally, piecemeal appeals are\r\n  not favored by the court and should be avoided.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville,\r\n  362 S.C. 191, 196, 607 S.E.2d 707, 709 (2005); Â Hercules, Inc. v. S.C.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This is an appeal from an order setting aside a tax sale concerning\r\n  a tract of land in Dorchester County, South Carolina.Â  The master found the\r\n  Dorchester County Delinquent Tax Collector failed to comply with statutory\r\n  notice requirements for a tax sale by failing to notify the property ownerâ€™s\r\n  children.Â  Â We reverse and reinstate the tax sale on the basis that the property\r\n  ownerâ€™s children had no interest in the property and were not entitled to\r\n  notice.Â   \r\nI.\r\nCharles\r\n  Hart (Husband) and Una Hart (Wife) once owned the property in question as\r\n  tenants in common.Â  Husband died intestate in 1985, survived by Wife and three\r\n  children (Children).Â  In 1986, it was agreed that title to the property would vest solely in Wife pursuant to a sale in aid of assets.Â \r\n  As a result, the probate court issued an order divesting the\r\n  Children of any interest in the property, leaving Wife as the sole owner.Â  The\r\n  1986 order called for the issuance of a deed to Wife.Â  This deed was not issued\r\n  until 2005, after the tax sale (which is the subject of this action) had been\r\n  completed.\r\nWife\r\n  paid the property taxes each year.Â  Wife, however, failed to pay the property\r\n  taxes beginning in 2001.Â  The deed of record in the land records office at the\r\n  time continued to show Wife and Husband as the property owners.Â  The tax\r\n  collector provided notice to Wife and Husband of the delinquency at the address\r\n  of record.Â  The taxes remained unpaid and the tax collector filed suit for a\r\n  tax sale for delinquent taxes, providing proper notice to Wife and Husband.\r\nAdolph\r\n  Fraser was the successful bidder at the tax sale.Â  The tax collector issued a\r\n  deed for the property to Fraser in April 2005, which was promptly recorded.Â \r\n  Thereafter, the deed contemplated by the 1986 probate order was issued and\r\n  recorded in August 2005.Â  Wife then issued a quit claim deed to James Bell in\r\n  September 2005.Â  Bell brought an action for quiet title against Fraser.Â  Bell claimed the tax sale was invalid due to lack of notice on the Children.Â  The master\r\n  agreed that the Children retained an interest in the property as a result of\r\n  Husbandâ€™s death intestate.Â  The master set aside the tax sale for failure of\r\n  the tax collector to provide notice to the Children.Â  The master declared Bellâ€™s title good.Â  Fraser appeals.\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  disposition of this appeal turns on the effect of the 1986 probate court order\r\n  divesting the Children of their interest in the property.Â  Fraser contends the\r\n  probate court order divested the Childrenâ€™s interest, notwithstanding the\r\n  failure in 1986 to issue and record the anticipated deed granting Wife title to\r\n  the property.Â  The question, then, is whether the issuance and recording of a\r\n  deed was necessary to give effect to the probate court order.Â  We find the\r\n  probate court order was, by itself, sufficient to bind the Children and\r\n  extinguish their interest in the property.Â  A probate court order is â€œbinding\r\n  on all parties in interest who are notified of the proceeding.â€Â  80 Am. Jur. 2d Wills Â§ 907 (2002).\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has described the effect of a probate court order\r\n  on multiple occasions.Â  â€œIt has been decided that the judgment of\r\n  the probate court as to the necessity of a sale of the realty, and a sale\r\n  pursuant thereto, is binding upon all parties to the record.â€Â  Dyson v.\r\n    Jones, 65 S.C. 308, 318, 43 S.E. 667, 671 (1903); see also Culler\r\n      v.

Wills Â§ 804 (2001) (â€œWith exceptions as to persons not notified and brought in as\r\n  parties, probate, until duly revoked or set aside, is generally considered as\r\n  binding on, or conclusive against, all the world, or on all parties, heirs, or\r\n  interested persons.â€).\r\nBecause the\r\n  Children were parties to the probate court proceedings in 1986, the 1986\r\n  probate court order divested Children of any interest in the property.Â  This is\r\n  so despite the approximate nineteen year lapse between the order and the\r\n  issuance of the deed.\r\nAccordingly, when\r\n  the tax collector was required to notify the property owners of the delinquent\r\n  tax, Wife was the only owner.Â  The tax collector sent proper notice to Wife.Â \r\n  The tax collector properly complied with the strict notice requirements of South Carolina law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 (Supp. 2006) (requiring notice of\r\n  delinquent property taxes be sent to â€œthe defaulting taxpayer and to a grantee\r\n  of recordâ€); Rives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C. 287, 293, 478 S.E.2d 878,\r\n  881&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (â€œFailure to give the required notice is a fundamental\r\n  defect in the tax proceedings which renders the proceedings absolutely\r\n  void.â€).Â  Here, the tax collector complied with section 12-51-40 by notifying\r\n  Wife, a fact which is undisputed.\r\nFinally, notice was\r\n  not improper because the tax collector attempted to notify deceased Husband.Â \r\n  The tax collector was not required to send notice to Husband, and we will not\r\n  find notice inadequate because a tax collector exceeded the statutory\r\n  notice requirements.Â  See S.C. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Atl. Land Title Co., 314 S.C. 292, 296, 442 S.E.2d 630, 632 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (holding â€œthat where, as here, notice of a tax sale exceeds the statutory\r\n  notice requirements, the tax deed may not be set aside on the basis of\r\n  insufficient noticeâ€).Â  Thus, the tax sale was proper, and Fraser has superior\r\n  title to the property.\r\nIII.\r\nFraser\r\n  is the owner of the real property pursuant to a valid tax sale.Â  The judgment\r\n  of the master is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4332","title":"State v.

McIntosh,\r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney\r\n  General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of\r\n  Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J.:Â  Appellant, Legaree Leavy Evans,\r\n  was indicted for and convicted of burglary in the first degree and possession\r\n  of burglary tools.Â  He appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in denying his\r\n  motion for directed verdict on the first-degree burglary charge because the\r\n  building in question did not qualify as a dwelling.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nAround\r\n  4:30 a.m. on December 21, 2004, a neighbor getting ready for work noticed the\r\n  lights on at the Shaw home on Gully Falls road in Pickens County.Â  Because the\r\n  neighbor knew the Shaws were rarely at the home and it was unusual to see\r\n  activity there, she called 9-1-1.Â  Deputies Porter and Sailors arrived at the\r\n  home to discover the lights on and the door open.Â  Deputy Sailors observed\r\n  someone near the back of a truck in the driveway, who turned and ran back\r\n  toward the house.Â  After Deputy Sailors radioed that a white male wearing an\r\n  orange shirt was running from the truck into the woods, Deputy Porter heard\r\n  someone behind the house and went after him.Â  There, he found appellant face\r\n  down on the ground with arms spread out.Â  Appellant had a flashlight and some\r\n  gloves with him.Â  A subsequent search of the truck revealed tools commonly used\r\n  in burglaries.Â   \r\nCharles\r\n  Shaw testified that he owned the home on Gully Falls Road for the past ten\r\n  years and this was a secondary residence.Â  He described the property as heavily\r\n  wooded, mountainous, and secluded.Â  His family had been â€œliving in it off and\r\n  on, going up there as a secondary house . . . until about three years ago.â€Â \r\n  Because of his wifeâ€™s medical condition and the treatments she received, they\r\n  were unable to live there or spend significant amounts of time there anymore.Â \r\n  However, Mr. Shaw testified he went to the home once every two weeks or once a\r\n  month, the utilities were all on, and the house was â€œready to be lived in.â€Â \r\n  The last time he and his wife had been to the property prior to December 21st\r\n  was December 5th of that year.Â  They remained at the house for about\r\n  two and a half to three hours on that day, retrieving some Christmas\r\n  decorations they had stored there, storing some other seasonal items, and\r\n  sitting in the home talking for about an hour and a half before they left.Â  On\r\n  cross examination, Mr. Shaw agreed they had been using the house as a storage\r\n  building â€œas circumstances prevented [them] from living thereâ€ for the past\r\n  three years.Â   \r\nMr.\r\n  Shaw and his wife met Detective Lovell and Lieutenant Robinson at the home the\r\n  following day.Â  When Mr. Shaw first entered the house, he found that plastic\r\n  storage containers he had used to store things had been emptied of their\r\n  contents and someone was using the containers to pack other items from the\r\n  home, such as teapots, music boxes, and plates.Â  Linens and towels from the\r\n  home were used to pad the items in the containers.Â  Missing from the home were numerous\r\n  teapots, a childâ€™s wagon, and a VCR.Â   \r\nFollowing\r\n  the close of the Stateâ€™s case, appellant moved for a directed verdict on the\r\n  first degree burglary charge, arguing there was no evidence the house was a\r\n  dwelling at the time of the alleged offense.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion, finding it was a factual question for the jury.Â  The jury returned\r\n  verdicts of guilty on both the burglary in the first degree and possession of\r\n  burglary tools charges.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe only issue raised on appeal is whether the trial court\r\n  erred in denying appellantâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the first-degree\r\n  burglary charge because the building did not meet the statutory definition of a\r\n  dwelling.Â  Appellant contends the undisputed evidence shows the property in\r\n  question was only a storage building, and though it had once been used as a\r\n  part-time residence, nobody had occupied or resided in it for at least three\r\n  years. Â Accordingly, he maintains it was no longer a dwelling house.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn reviewing a directed verdict motion, the trial court is\r\n  concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Parris,\r\n  363 S.C. 477, 481, 611 S.E.2d 501, 502-03 (2005). Â A defendant is entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict when the State fails to present evidence on a material element\r\n  of the offense charged.Â  State v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 586, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  392, 395 (2004).Â  On appeal from the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the\r\n  evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nâ€œA person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the\r\n  person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in\r\n  the dwelling, and . . . the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(3) (2003).Â  â€œDwelling houseâ€ as used in the arson\r\n  and burglary statutes is defined as â€œany house, outhouse,\r\n  apartment, building, erection, shed or box in which there sleeps a . . . person\r\n  who lodges there with a view to the protection of property.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-10 (2003).Â   \r\nIn the 1979 case of State v. Ferebee, 273 S.C. 403, 257\r\n  S.E.2d 154 (1979) our Supreme Court held that a vacant apartment unit,\r\n  abandoned a week prior by former tenants, was not a dwelling house for purposes\r\n  of the burglary statute.Â  Id. at 405, 257 S.E.2d at 155.Â  The court\r\n  found section 16-11-10 required the apartment have an identifiable occupant\r\n  sleeping or residing therein to so qualify, and while the temporary absence of\r\n  occupants will not prevent a residence from becoming the subject of a burglary,\r\n  it required that the occupant leave with the purpose of returning in order for\r\n  the apartment to be considered a dwelling.Â  Id.Â  In applying Ferebee to an arson case, our Supreme Court in State v. Glenn, 297 S.C. 29, 374\r\n  S.E.2d 671 (1988) determined, where the occupant had left over $10,000 worth of\r\n  personal possessions in a mobile home and had returned to the mobile home on\r\n  numerous occasions to gather some possessions, there was sufficient evidence\r\n  she did not vacate the home but left with the intention of returning.Â  Id. Â at 32, 374 S.E.2d at 672.Â  Accordingly, the court found the trial court did not\r\n  err in failing to direct a verdict on the second degree arson charge based on\r\n  Glennâ€™s argument that the home did not constitute a dwelling house under section\r\n  16-11-110.Â  Id.Â  Thus, â€œthe test of whether a building is a dwelling\r\n  house turns on whether the occupant has left with the intention to return.â€Â  Id. (analyzing Ferebee).Â  Temporary absence from a â€œdwellingâ€ is irrelevant.Â  State v. White, 349 S.C. 33, 36, 562 S.E.2d 305, 306 (2002).\r\nHere, there is sufficient evidence of the Shawsâ€™ intent to\r\n  return to the mountain property.Â  As noted by Mr. Shaw, they visited the home\r\n  about once every two weeks or month, the utilities were all on in the home, and\r\n  it was â€œready to be lived in.â€Â  They had previously been â€œliving in [the home]\r\n  off and on,â€ and the only reason the Shaws had not been staying overnight in\r\n  the home the last three years was his wifeâ€™s current medical condition\r\n  prevented them from doing so.Â  See William Shepard McAninch &amp; W.\r\n  Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina 445 (4th ed. 2002)\r\n  (â€œ[A] person could have more than a single dwelling house, any of which might\r\n  be the object of a burglary despite the occupantâ€™s absence for extended periods\r\n  of time, so long as he had an intention to return.Â  Consequently, a vacation\r\n  cottage would qualify as a dwelling house even though the owner had not been\r\n  there in months.â€). Â Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial\r\n  of appellantâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the first degree burglary charge.\r\nBased on the foregoing, Evansâ€™ conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4333","title":"State v.

Â We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nDantonio was involved in a three-car\r\n  collision on December 30, 2004 resulting in two fatalities.Â  The accident\r\n  occurred between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m. on Highway 17 by-pass near Murrells Inlet.Â \r\n  The Jeep Dantonio was driving struck a Honda driven by Katinka Mandoza as she\r\n  turned into the right lane of Highway 17 by-pass.Â  After hitting Mandoza, Dantonioâ€™s\r\n  Jeep crossed the median and collided with an oncoming vehicle.Â  The driver of\r\n  the oncoming car, Elise Anne Anderson, and her passenger, Derrick Michael Labar,\r\n  were killed.\r\nDantonio\r\n  had been drinking with friends at the Dead Dog Saloon since about 4:00 p.m. on\r\n  the afternoon of the accident.Â  At approximately 9:35 p.m., Dantonio paid the\r\n  bar tab for his party of four.Â  Thirty-seven beers were charged to Dantonioâ€™s bill.Â \r\n  Bartender Diane Tracy testified she was concerned about Dantonioâ€™s ability to\r\n  drive, but felt reassured when she learned his wife had the keys to the Jeep in\r\n  her possession.Â  Nevertheless, Dantonio was driving at the time of the\r\n  accident.Â  A blood sample drawn from Dantonio at 12:35 a.m., on December 31,\r\n  2004, revealed a blood alcohol concentration of .114.Â  Authorities arrested\r\n  Dantonio at the hospital for felony driving under the influence.\r\nCorporals\r\n  Dangerfield, Breland, and Jarrett of the South Carolina Highway Patrol\r\n  Multi-Disciplinary Accident Investigation Team (M.A.I.T.) were qualified as experts\r\n  in the field of collision reconstruction.Â  The team concluded neither roadway nor\r\n  weather conditions caused the collision.Â  Dantonio appeared to be driving at a\r\n  minimum of eighty-five (85) miles per hour in a fifty-five (55) mile per hour\r\n  zone.Â  His speed and the fact that Dantonio was driving under the influence\r\n  contributed to the accident.Â  The driver of the Honda was not responsible for\r\n  the collision because she stopped at the stop sign and saw Dantonioâ€™s Jeep at\r\n  least 343 feet down the roadway before she pulled out into the intersection.Â \r\n  An animation expert reported the data collected showed the collision would not\r\n  have occurred if Dantonio had been driving fifty-five (55) miles per hour.\r\n \r\nAt the\r\n  close of the Stateâ€™s case, Dantonio moved for a directed verdict of not guilty,\r\n  arguing the jury could not find beyond a reasonable doubt speed was the proximate\r\n  cause of the collision.Â  Dantonio averred the trial court should remove the\r\n  question from the jury by directing the verdict because the evidence did not\r\n  support a conclusion Dantonioâ€™s speed was the only cause of the accident.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court denied Dantonioâ€™s directed verdict motion, clarifying the ruling:\r\n\r\n\t[A]s I understand the law on a motion for directed verdict, the\r\n  defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce\r\n  evidence of the offense charged, and the trial court is charged with the duty\r\n  that, in reviewing a motion for a directed verdict the trial judge is concerned\r\n  with the existence of the evidence, not its weight.Â  In other words, if there\r\n  is direct evidence, or substantial circumstantial evidence, reasonably tending\r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, the case should go forward, and that is the\r\n  standard that Iâ€™m using, and I want to make that clear, because I understand\r\n  that to be the directed verdict standard. \r\n\tNow, with that I have made some excerpts from the testimony, as I\r\n  have heard it in this particular case.Â  Ms. Diane Tracy indicated she had\r\n  questions about the Defendantâ€™s condition, and was told the wife had the keys.Â \r\n  Ms. Mandoza indicated the accident had happened at night, but that night did\r\n  not cause a problem to her; she was on the phone with a girlfriend, with an ear\r\n  piece; that did not cause a problem with her; she was driving a stick-shift; that\r\n  was not a problem to her; the Defendant was in the other lane, the fast lane;\r\n  that wasnâ€™t a problem; her windows were fogged up, but she rolled one [down],\r\n  thatâ€™s not a problem for her; she looks left, right, left, sees the headlights\r\n  by the cinema sign, and her testimony, as I heard it was, I figured it was safe\r\n  enough to pull out in front of the Defendant.Â  She says she stopped at the stop\r\n  sign.Â  She indicates that she was, in no way, responsible for the accident.\r\n\tNow, whether or not this testimony is believable or not, whether\r\n  the Court believes it or not, whether itâ€™s human nature to deny responsibility\r\n  for a horrendous accident, or any cause to it, thatâ€™s not my job.Â  Thatâ€™s the\r\n  juryâ€™s job.Â  Iâ€™m concerned with the existence of evidence in this matter. \r\n\t\r\n\tFurther evidence in this case.Â  There is a stipulation of facts.Â  Two\r\n  young people died as a result of this accident.Â  Mr. Summers stated the\r\n  Defendant had an odor of alcohol.Â  He stated thatâ€”to Mr. Summers that he had a\r\n  couple of beers.Â  Corporal Dangerfield statedâ€”though there were different\r\n  accounts of what occurred, itâ€™s very difficult to calculate speed, theâ€”and he\r\n  indicated the collision occurred in the right lane.Â  Corporal Breland,\r\n  qualified to give his opinion, stated that the weather was no problem; the road\r\n  conditions were good; the site and distance were good.Â  He concluded the\r\n  Defendant was driving eighty-five miles an hour.Â  He said speed contributed to\r\n  the accident.Â  Corroboratedâ€”he said the evidence corroborated drinking; speed\r\n  at the impact was fifty-five miles an hour.Â  He stated he assumed Ms. Mandoza\r\n  had stopped at the stop sign.Â  He stated if the Defendant was going fifty-five\r\n  miles an hour there would have been no wreck.Â  Corporal Jarrett says that a\r\n  computer animation is a visual representation of what we believe happened; the\r\n  wreck would not have happened if the Defendant was going fifty-five miles an\r\n  hour; the Defendant was in the right lane and made an effort to steer away from\r\n  Ms. Mandoza.Â  Trooper Hughes:Â  The Defendant, at the hospital, had a strong\r\n  smell of alcohol about him.Â  Ms Barber:Â  The blood alcohol level was zero point\r\n  one one four at 12:35 A.M., significantly after the accident; the permissive\r\n  level is zero point zero eight.Â  That being a brief summation of the testimony\r\n  in this case, there is no question, in this Courtâ€™s mind that, looking at the\r\n  existence of evidence that, if that evidence was believed by the jury, there is\r\n  enough evidence to prove the Defendant guilty of the crimes charged, and at\r\n  this point in time the Court respectfully declines to grant your motion for a\r\n  directed verdict. \r\n\r\nAt the close of all evidence, Dantonio renewed his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict, professing Mandozaâ€™s act of entering the highway played a\r\n  role in the collision and would preclude a jury finding beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt Dantonioâ€™s speed was the proximate cause of the collision.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied Dantonioâ€™s motion:\r\n\r\n\tOnce again, the Court believes its responsibility, in response to\r\n  a directed verdict motion, is on this basis, that the defendant is entitled to\r\n  a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged, and the trial judge is concerned with the existence of evidence, not\r\n  with its weight.Â  If there is direct evidence or substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the [guilt] of the defendant, the case\r\n  must be submitted to the jury.\r\n\tIâ€™m not going to go back and review all of that testimony. Â I did\r\n  at the end of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  I just reaffirm that rendition of the facts I\r\n  previously gave.Â  \r\n\tFurther, in addition to that, I find that the evidence presented\r\n  thereafter only supports the finding by this Court that there is more than\r\n  sufficient evidence, if believed by the juryâ€”that being their job, to judge the\r\n  credibility and believability of the witnessesâ€”but there has been testimony and\r\n  evidence presented, if believed by the jury, that would prove the Defendant\r\n  guilty of the crimes charged by the State, and therefore I would respectfully\r\n  decline to grant your motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\tOn the\r\n  definition of proximate cause, the trial court instructed the jury:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tProximate cause is the direct cause, the immediate cause, the\r\n  efficient cause, the cause without which the death would not have resulted.Â \r\n  Now, there may be more than one proximate cause.Â  The acts of two or more\r\n  persons may combine together to be a proximate cause of the death of a person.Â \r\n  The Defendantâ€™s act may be regarded as the proximate cause if it is the direct\r\n  cause to the death of the victim.Â  The fact that other causes also contribute\r\n  to the death of the victim does not relieve the Defendant from responsibility.Â \r\n  The Defendantâ€™s act need not be the sole cause of death, but it has to be the\r\n  direct cause, without which the death of the victim would not have resulted,\r\n  and this has to be proved to you by the State of South Carolina beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.\r\n\tDantonio\r\n  objected to the proximate cause charge:\r\n\tI believe that the law, the actual law here should be that, unless\r\n  Mr. Dâ€™Antonio is at least fifty-one percentâ€”and I would argue much moreâ€”but at\r\n  least fifty-one percent the proximate cause, that it would be improper for\r\n  there to be a finding of guilt.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tI would prefer, and feel like it would be more appropriate and\r\n  more accurately reflect the law if, added to the word direct, the word main or\r\n  primary were added, then we would insure that all of us were operating with the\r\n  understanding that Mr. Dâ€™Antonio would have to be at least fifty-one percent\r\n  proximately causing it in order for him to be found guilty.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court declined to incorporate Dantonioâ€™s request, expounding the issued\r\n  charge properly instructed the jury on the law of proximate cause in South Carolina.Â  Shortly after beginning deliberation, the jury asked to rehear portions of\r\n  testimony and the jury instructions on proximate cause.Â  The part of the testimony\r\n  was replayed for the jury, and the trial court reiterated instructions on\r\n  proximate cause, intervening act, and unavoidable accident.Â  The jury returned\r\n  a verdict of guilty on the two felony driving under the influence charges.Â  Dantonio was sentenced to two concurrent seventeen-year terms of imprisonment.\r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v.

Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785,\r\n  793-94 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nSection\r\n  56-5-2945(A) of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2006) establishes the\r\n  elements of felony driving under the influence:Â   \r\n\r\n\tA person who, while under the\r\n  influence of alcohol, drugs, or the combination of alcohol and drugs, drives a\r\n  vehicle and when driving does any act forbidden by law or neglects any duty\r\n  imposed by law in the driving of the vehicle, which act or neglect proximately\r\n  causes great bodily injury or death to a person other than himself, is guilty\r\n  of a felony . . . .\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Grampus is the leading case in South Carolina setting forth the elements\r\n  of felony driving under the influence.Â  288 S.C. 395, 343 S.E.2d 26 (1986) abrogated\r\n    on other grounds by State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617\r\n  (1997).Â  A felony driving under the influence charge requires proof of three\r\n  elements:Â  (1) the actor drives a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol\r\n  or drugs; (2) the actor does an act forbidden by law or neglects a duty imposed\r\n  by law; and (3) the act or neglect proximately causes great bodily harm or\r\n  death to another person.Â  Id. at 397, 343 S.E.2d at 27; accord State\r\n    v. White 311 S.C. 289, 428 S.E.2d 740 (Ct. App. 1993); State v. Nathari,\r\n  303 S.C. 188, 399 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nIn\r\n  addition, section 56-5-2950(b)(3) of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp.\r\n  2006) provides in the criminal prosecution of a violation under section\r\n  56-5-2945, an alcohol concentration of eight one-hundredths of one percent or\r\n  more, as shown by chemical analysis of the personâ€™s breath or other body\r\n  fluids, gives rise to the inference the person was under the influence of\r\n  alcohol.  \r\nThe\r\n  State presented evidence satisfying the elements in section 56-5-2945(A) and from\r\n  which Dantonioâ€™s guilt may reasonably and logically be deduced.Â  The jeep\r\n  Dantonio was driving struck Mandozaâ€™s Honda.Â  Testimony indicated Dantonio had\r\n  been drinking during the hours prior to the accident, and his blood alcohol\r\n  concentration suggested he was under the influence of alcohol.Â  Collision\r\n  reconstruction experts opined Dantonio drove in excess of eighty (80) miles per\r\n  hour in a fifty-five (55) mile per hour speed zoneâ€”an act forbidden by law.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the State introduced evidence that but for Dantonioâ€™s speeding, the collision\r\n  with Mandozaâ€™s vehicle would not have occurred.Â  Considering the existence of\r\n  this evidence in a light most favorable to the State, we conclude the trial\r\n  court properly denied Dantonioâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.  \r\nDantonio\r\n  contends, as a matter of law, because a jury could not reasonably find his\r\n  speeding was the â€œsole,â€ â€œmain,â€ or â€œprimaryâ€ cause of the collision and\r\n  resulting fatalities, the trial court should remove the case from the jury and\r\n  direct a verdict.Â  South Carolina precedent concerning proximate cause does not\r\n  support this assertion.Â   \r\nA\r\n  defendantâ€™s act may be regarded as the proximate cause if it is a contributing\r\n  cause of the death of the deceased.Â  State v. Burton, 302 S.C. 494,\r\n  496-97, 397 S.E.2d 90, 91 (1990) (setting out the law of South Carolina on\r\n  proximate cause in a jury charge).Â  The defendantâ€™s act need not be the sole\r\n  cause of the death, provided it is a proximate cause actually contributing to\r\n  the death of the deceased. Â Id.\r\nâ€œOne\r\n  who inflicts an injury on another is deemed by law to be guilty of homicide\r\n  where the injury contributes mediately or immediately to the death of the\r\n  other.Â  The fact that other causes also contribute to the death does not\r\n  relieve the actor from responsibility.â€Â  State v. Riley, 219 S.C. 112,\r\n  112, 64 S.E.2d 127, 130 (1951) (citing State v. Doe, 218 S.C. 520, 520,\r\n  63 S.E.2d 303, 303 (1951)); accord State v. Jenkins, 276 S.C.\r\n  209, 211, 277 S.E.2d 147, 148 (1981) (finding one who inflicts an injury on\r\n  another is deemed by law to be guilty of homicide where the injury contributes\r\n  mediately or immediately to the death of the other).Â   \r\nDantonio\r\n  claims speed, as a contributing factor, is without legal significance because but\r\n  for Mandozaâ€™s entrance onto the highway in front of him, the accident would not\r\n  have occurred.Â  In support of this position, Dantonio cites Horton v.\r\n    Greyhound Corp., 241 S.C. 430, 128 S.E.2d 776 (1962).Â  Horton involved a claim alleging negligence in the death of a passenger who was killed\r\n  when the truck he was riding in collided with defendant Greyhoundâ€™s bus.Â  Id. at 430, 128 S.E.2d at 778.Â  The trial court directed a verdict in Greyhoundâ€™s\r\n  favor.Â  The sole issue on appeal was whether Horton sustained the burden of\r\n  producing evidence to support a reasonable inference of causal connection\r\n  between the speed of the bus and the fatal collision.Â  Id.  \r\nThe driver\r\n  of the truck in which Hortonâ€™s decedent was a passenger executed an unlawful\r\n  turn from behind another vehicle into the southbound lane of oncoming traffic.Â  Id. Â The Greyhound bus, traveling south at an allegedly high rate of\r\n  speed, collided with the truck. Â Id. Â In reviewing the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling, the South Carolina Supreme Court acknowledged the evidence was\r\n  sufficient to raise a jury issue as to whether the bus was being operated at an\r\n  excessive rate of speed.Â  Id.Â  However, the overarching issue was\r\n  whether a reasonable inference of causal connection between the busâ€™s speed and\r\n  the collision could be drawn.Â  Id. at 430, 128 S.E.2d at 781.  \r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  affirming the directed verdict, our Supreme Court stated:\r\n\tIt is abundantly clear that the primary efficient cause of the\r\n  collision was the unlawful act of the truck driver in turning his north bound\r\n  vehicle into the southbound lane of travel, which was occupied by the approaching\r\n  bus.Â  It is equally clear that the only evidence of a negligent or unlawful act\r\n  by the bus driver relates to excessive speed, which could not have resulted in\r\n  harm to [decedent] if the truck had remained in its proper lane of travel.Â  The\r\n  concurrence of excessive speed with this primary, efficient cause of the\r\n  collision does not impose liability on the defendants unless, without it, the\r\n  collision would not have occurred. \r\n\r\nId.Â Â Â Â   \r\nThe Court\r\n  emphasized speed, as a contributing factor in placing the bus in a particular\r\n  location on the highway, was without legal significance. Â Id. Greyhound was\r\n  rightfully in the proper lane of traffic on that portion of the highway. The\r\n  accident would not have occurred but for the truck driverâ€™s unlawful turn into\r\n  the path of the oncoming bus. Â Horton failed to establish evidence sufficient\r\n  to raise a reasonable inference that the collision would not have occurred but\r\n  for the negligence of the bus driver.Â  Id. at 430, 128 S.E.2d at 781-82.\r\nIn Clark\r\n  v. Cantrell, we observed that the application of Horton is limited\r\n  to cases with specific factual scenarios. Â 332 S.C. 433, 444, 504 S.E.2d 605,\r\n  611 (Ct. App. 1998) affâ€™d as modified by 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528\r\n  (2000).Â  â€œEach of those cases involved entry of a vehicle from a servient\r\n  roadway onto the main highway, in such an abrupt fashion that an accident could\r\n  not have been avoided, notwithstanding the excessive speed of the oncoming\r\n  vehicle.â€Â  Id. (quoting Tubbs v. Bowie, 308 S.C. 155, 158, 417\r\n  S.E.2d 550, 552 (1992)).\r\nHorton is factually distinguishable from the case sub judice and does\r\n  not support Dantonioâ€™s assertion of error.Â  Hortonâ€™s evidence failed to raise a\r\n  reasonable inference that but for the speed of the bus, the fatal collision\r\n  would not have occurred.Â  Here, the State presented evidence clearly supporting\r\n  the inference that but for excessive speed, Dantonioâ€™s Jeep would not have\r\n  collided with Mandozaâ€™s Honda and been propelled across the median into\r\n  oncoming traffic.Â  Unlike the truck driver in Horton, Mandoza turned\r\n  onto the highway lawfully, into the appropriate lane of traffic. Â She believed\r\n  Dantonioâ€™s vehicle was far enough away for her to safely turn into the right\r\n  lane. Â There is no evidence she entered the roadway so abruptly that the accident\r\n  could not have been avoided.  \r\nCollision\r\n  reconstruction testimony indicated Dantonio was traveling significantly in\r\n  excess of the lawful speed limit.Â  Additionally, medical test results showed\r\n  Dantonio was likely under the influence of alcohol.Â  Experts opined if Dantonio\r\n  had driven at fifty-five (55) miles per hour, the lawful speed limit, he would\r\n  not have collided with Mandoza.Â  The impact with Mandozaâ€™s Honda thrust his\r\n  Jeep across the median and into another vehicle, killing the two occupants.Â  This\r\n  evidence, if believed by the jury, could lead to the fair and logical deduction\r\n  that Dantonioâ€™s unlawful conduct was the proximate cause of the fatalities.Â  The\r\n  trial court did not err as a matter of law in submitting the case to the jury.\r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Instruction\r\nDantonio\r\n  alleges the trial court erred in charging the law on proximate cause.Â \r\n  Specifically, Dantonio argues the words â€œmainâ€ or â€œprimaryâ€ should supplement\r\n  the word â€œdirectâ€ in defining proximate cause.Â  We discern no error in the trial courtâ€™s instruction.Â \r\n \r\nGenerally, a trial\r\n  court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v.

Â We reverse and remand.\r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 11, 2002, Contractor and Homeowner[1] executed a five-page contract requiring Contractor to construct and install a\r\n  swimming pool, spa, and water feature at Homeownerâ€™s residence for a price of\r\n  $69,742. Â The partiesâ€™ contract contained\r\n  five labeled sections: (1) General Specifications: duties Contractor was\r\n  required to perform; (2) Miscellaneous: duties Homeowner was required to\r\n  perform, including excavating rock, hauling dirt, masonry work, landscaping,\r\n  etc; (3) Payment: Homeowner was required to make five separate payments\r\n  to Contractor upon completion of five corresponding tasks; (4) Agreed\r\n    Conditions: twenty-five (25) specific conditions mutually agreed to by the\r\n  parties; and (5) Witnesseth: a reiteration of Contractorâ€™s promise to\r\n  construct the pool and Homeownerâ€™s promise to pay $69,742 â€œat the five\r\n  intervals in accordance with the schedule of values.â€ Â The parties initialed and\r\n  dated each page of the contract.

If work progress payments are not made in full by the [Home]owner in the\r\n  amount and in the manner specified in this agreement, all work by Contractor[]\r\n  and his agents will immediately cease and all equipment . . . will be removed\r\n  from the pool site by Contractor. . . . [Home]owner shall pay to Contractor all reasonable attorney fees &amp; all costs &amp;\r\n  expenses incurred to collect any sums past due from [H]omeowner including but\r\n  not limited to all court costs. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHomeowner paid\r\n  Contractor the deposit on April 11, 2002, as specified. Â Contractor completed the Phase 1 digging work and,\r\n  on April 24, 2002, Homeowner paid Contractor the specified payment. Â Next, Contractor completed the Phase 2 shoot[2] and, on May 16, 2002, Homeowner paid Contractor the specified\r\n  payment. Â Contractor then completed the\r\n  Phase 4 deck pour; however, Homeowner refused to pay Contractor the specified\r\n  payment of $13,948. \r\nAfter\r\n  Homeowner refused to pay Contractor for his Phase 4 work, their contractual\r\n  relationship reached an impasse with Homeowner owing Contractor $19,345.[3] Â Pursuant to paragraph 14 of the Agreed Conditions,\r\n  Contractor suspended work on the job and removed his equipment from the site.[4] Â Homeowner made no further payments to\r\n  Contractor and did not contact him for nine months.Â   \r\nBy a letter\r\n  dated March 13, 2003, Homeownerâ€™s attorney proposed that his client put $18,000\r\n  into the attorneyâ€™s trust fund for payment to Contractor upon completion of the\r\n  pool project.Â  Contractor did not accept Homeownerâ€™s\r\n  offer.Â  Homeowner commenced this action\r\n  for breach of contract and conversion.Â  Contractor\r\n  answered, pleading affirmative defenses[5] and asserting a counterclaim for breach of contract and attorneysâ€™ fees. Â \r\nFollowing a\r\n  bench trial, the master concluded the contract language stating Homeownerâ€™s\r\n  payment obligations under the contract was â€œat best, ambiguous,â€ and that any\r\n  ambiguity must be construed against Contractor, as drafter of the contract. Â The master entered judgment in favor of\r\n  Homeowner on the breach of contract claim and awarded compensatory damages of\r\n  $30,000.Â  The master denied Homeownerâ€™s\r\n  conversion claim and Contractorâ€™s counterclaim.Â  Subsequently, Â the master denied Contractorâ€™s motion\r\n  to reconsider, alter or amend the order.Â  This appeal followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action to construe a contract is an action at law.Â  Pruitt v. S.C. Med.\r\n    Malpractice Liability Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).Â  Likewise,\r\n  â€œ[a]n action for breach of contract seeking money damages is\r\n  an action at law.â€ Â R\r\n    &amp; G Constr., Inc., v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424,\r\n  430, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000). Â When reviewing a judgment made in a law case\r\n  tried by a master without a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the masterâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact unless the findings are found to be without evidence reasonably supporting them. Â See Karl\r\n    Sitte Plumbing Co., Inc. v. Darby Dev. Co. of Columbia, Inc., 295 S.C. 70, 77,\r\n  367 S.E.2d 162, 166 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  However, â€œ[a] reviewing court is free to decide questions of law with no\r\n  particular deference to the trial court.â€Â  Hunt v. S.C. Forestry Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564,\r\n  569, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848-49 (Ct. App. 2004).  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Ambiguity\r\n  of Contract Language\r\nContractor first argues it was an error of law for the master to find that\r\n  the payment terms of the contract were ambiguous.Â  We agree.  \r\nâ€œIt\r\n  is a question of law for the court whether the language of a contract is\r\n  ambiguous.â€ Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299,\r\n  302-03 (2001).Â  In determining as\r\n  a matter of law whether a contract is ambiguous, the court must consider the\r\n  contract as a whole, rather than deciding whether phrases in isolation could be\r\n  interpreted in various ways: â€œ[O]ne may not, by pointing out a single sentence\r\n  or clause, create an ambiguity.â€ Â Yarborough v.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 348 (1976).Â  â€œWhether a contract is ambiguous is to be\r\n  determined from the entire contract and not from isolated portions of the\r\n  contract.â€Â  Farr v.\r\n    Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431, 433 (1975).Â   \r\nHomeowner\r\n  argues he was justified in refusing to pay Contractor for the deck pour because\r\n  the payment terms of the contract were ambiguous. Â However, Homeowner cannot create ambiguity\r\n  when it does not exist within the four corners: Â \r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  construing and determining the effect of a written contract, the intention of\r\n  the parties and the meaning are gathered primarily from the contents of the\r\n  writing itself, or, as otherwise stated, from the four corners of the\r\n  instrument, and when such contract is clear and unequivocal,\r\n  its meaning must be determined by its contents alone; and a meaning cannot be\r\n  given it other than that expressed. Â Hence\r\n  words cannot be read into a contract which import an intent wholly unexpressed when the contract was executed.\r\n\r\nMcPherson\r\n  v. J.E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C.\r\n  183, 204, 33 S.E.2d 501, 509 (1945).  \r\nHomeowner\r\n  attempts to create ambiguity by arguing the contract language implies that\r\n  actual â€œwork progressâ€ could be the partiesâ€™ intended basis for calculating both\r\n  the amount and scheduling of payments to Contractor.Â  Additionally, he argues the contract language\r\n  reasonably could be interpreted to imply that payments to Contractor could be\r\n  proportionate to Homeownerâ€™s subjective perception of the â€œvalueâ€ he had\r\n  received.[6] Â \r\nHomeowner\r\n  acknowledges he complied with the payment schedule until Contractor demanded\r\n  payment for the Phase 4 deck pour, stating he refused to make the Phase 4\r\n  payment because â€œhe surmised the pool was only twenty percent (20%) complete .\r\n  . . [and he] refused to send additional monies until the percentage of\r\n  completion more closely equaled the money paid.â€Â  In contrast, Contractor points to the four\r\n  corners of the contract and argues Homeowner breached the contract by failing\r\n  to pay for Phase 4 after the deck pour was completed.Â  Contractor\r\n  strengthens this position by referring to paragraph 14 of the Agreed Conditions\r\n  that expressly authorized Contractor to cease work if Homeowner failed to pay\r\n  for completed work according to the specified schedule.Â   \r\nHere,\r\n  we find the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous.Â  See Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp.,\r\n  328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œA contract is\r\n  ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively\r\n  by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire\r\n  integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages,\r\n  and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.â€).\r\n  Â Read as a whole, the contract states\r\n  that Homeowner is required to make five specific payments, each corresponding\r\n  to Contractorâ€™s performance of a specific task.Â  This payment schedule is explicitly explained in the section labeled\r\n  â€œPaymentâ€ and is later reinforced,\r\n  both in paragraph 14 of â€œAgreed Conditionsâ€ and in the final section of the\r\n  contract. Â Homeownerâ€™s actions in making the first three payments according to the\r\n  schedule set forth in partiesâ€™ written contract indicates that Homeowner and\r\n  Contractor shared a common understanding of the payment terms.Â   \r\nBecause\r\n  we find this contract is clear, explicit, unambiguous, and capable of only one\r\n  reasonable interpretation, the court does not look beyond the four corners to\r\n  discern the partiesâ€™ intentions. Â See Keith v. River Consulting, Inc., 365 S.C. 500, 506, 618 S.E.2d 302, 305\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005) (explaining parol evidence is admissible to discover the\r\n  partiesâ€™ intentions when a contract is silent Â regarding a particular issue). Â Therefore, we reverse the masterâ€™s finding\r\n  that the contractâ€™s payment terms were ambiguous.\r\nII.&nbsp; Breach of\r\n  Contract\r\nNext, Contractor argues there was no\r\n  evidentiary support for the masterâ€™s finding that Contractor breached the\r\n  partiesâ€™ contract. Â We agree.  \r\nâ€œ[E]vidence\r\n  that a party complied with the terms of the alleged contract or acted in\r\n  conformity therewith is relevant and admissible on the issues of the contractâ€™s\r\n  existence, the meaning of its terms, and whether the contract was\r\n  breached.â€Â  Conner\r\n    v. City of\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Forest\r\n    Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 473, 611 S.E.2d 905, 912 (2005). Â â€œThe failure to pay an instal[l]ment of the contract price as\r\n  provided in a building or construction contract is a substantial breach of the\r\n  contract, and gives the contractor the right to consider the contract at an\r\n  end, to cease work, and to recover the value of work already performed.â€ Â Zemp Constr. Co. v.\r\n    Harmon Bros. Constr. Co., 225 S.C. 361, 366, 82 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1954). Â \r\nHere, Homeowner\r\n  paid the first three installments as scheduled under the contract terms, yet he refused to make the Phase 4 installment after the deck was\r\n  poured. Â Homeowner explains he refused to make the Phase 4\r\n  payment because the project was, in his opinion, only twenty percent complete. However,\r\n  Homeowner is not permitted to reinterpret written contract terms midstream\r\n  because he is unhappy with the contract he executed. Â See Ecclesiastes Prod. Ministries v.\r\n    Outparcel Assocs., LLC, 374 S.C. 483, 498, 649 S.E.2d 494, 501 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (â€œParties [to a contract] are governed by their outward expressions and the\r\n  court is not at liberty to consider their secret intentions.â€); Bannon v.\r\n    Knauss, 282 S.C. 589, 593, 320 S.E.2d 470, 472 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (â€œInterpretation of the contract is governed by the objective manifestation of\r\n  the partiesâ€™ assent at the time the contract was made. Â It does not depend on the subjective, after\r\n  the fact meaning one party assigns to it.â€). Â We find Homeownerâ€™s failure to make the Phase\r\n  4 installment payment constitutes his substantial breach of the partiesâ€™ contract. Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Damages for Breach of\r\n  Contract \r\nBecause\r\n  Homeowner was the first party to breach the contract, we find he must bear the\r\n  liability for his nonperformance. Â â€œWhere\r\n  a contract is not performed, the party who is guilty of the first breach is\r\n  generally the one upon whom all liability for the nonperformance rests.â€Â  Willms Trucking Co., Inc. v. JW Constr.\r\n    Co., Inc., 314 S.C. 170, 178, 442 S.E.2d 197, 201 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994) (â€œWhen the language of a contract\r\n  is plain and capable of legal construction, that language alone determines the\r\n  instrumentâ€™s force and effect. Â The Â courtâ€™s duty is\r\n  to Â enforce the contract made by the\r\n  parties regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the\r\n  partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.â€). Â Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph 14 of the Agreed\r\n  Conditions of the partiesâ€™ contract, we find Contractor is entitled to attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees and court costs, and remand this issue for a determination of reasonable fees\r\n  and costs.  \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED. \r\nKITTREDGE, J., and THOMAS, J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Homeowner is\r\n  a college-educated, residential contractor who has built approximately 2,000\r\n  homes in the\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  Spartanburg\r\n  area that range in price from $130,000 to $650,000.Â  He has over thirty years of experience\r\n  working as a contractor.Â   \r\n[2]&nbsp; A â€œshootâ€ is a term for the installation\r\n  of a poolâ€™s inner shell.  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Contractor\r\n  alleged Homeowner\r\n  also did not pay invoices of $5,397 for additional work performed under the\r\n  contract, including: $3,688 for\r\n  specialized excavation necessitated by uncovered conditions, authorized by\r\n  paragraph 7 of the Agreed Conditions; $420 for an extra load of concrete; and\r\n  $1,289 for enlarging the pool deck. Â \r\n[4]&nbsp; Contractor\r\n  claims Homeowner owed him $22,833.Â  Contractor\r\n  testified he considered pursuing Homeowner to recover the outstanding balance under the original contract ($17,436)\r\n  and the amount past due for additional work performed ($5,397).Â  However, after comparing the payments\r\n  Contractor had received to date ($52,306) with his direct costs and overhead,\r\n  he found he was â€œbasically at a break-even point at that time, and it wasnâ€™t\r\n  worth pursuingâ€ an action against Homeowner.Â   \r\n[5]&nbsp; Contractor alleged, pursuant\r\n  to the conditions of their contract, that Homeownerâ€™s failure to pay for the\r\n  completed Phase 4 work justified his suspension of work.Â Â Â   \r\n[6]&nbsp; Homeowner cites Websterâ€™s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1985) as an authority for his\r\n  interpretation of the word â€œvalueâ€ in the contractâ€™s Schedule of Values,\r\n  stating that definition two defines â€œvalueâ€ as â€œa fair return or equivalent in\r\n  goods.â€Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4335","title":"State v.

Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor\r\n  David Michael Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Lawrence Marcus Tucker appeals the entry of his guilty plea in\r\n  which he waived his rights to appellate review and post-conviction relief.Â  He\r\n  argues his appearance in a South Carolina court violated the Interstate\r\n  Agreement on Detainers Act and his conviction should be vacated.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â  Tucker also argues the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea\r\n  in which he waived the right to file an action for post-conviction relief.Â  We find\r\n  this issue is not ripe for our review.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nTucker\r\n  was charged with two counts of assault with intent to kill and one count of\r\n  assault and battery with intent to kill after an incident in Calhoun County on October 20, 2002.Â  Following his May 13, 2003 Calhoun County Grand Jury indictments,\r\n  Tucker was convicted in a federal court of the unauthorized use of a device\r\n  while on bond and began serving his federal sentence.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  February 2006, Tucker was transferred from the Edgefield Federal Correctional\r\n  Institution to Calhoun County to dispose of the three indictments against him. Â Although\r\n  the State was prepared to proceed to trial, Tucker had never met with his\r\n  attorney and thus moved for a continuance.Â  The trial court granted his motion and\r\n  Tucker was returned to federal custody.\r\nOn\r\n  March 20, 2006, Tucker was again transferred into state custody to dispose of\r\n  the three indictments.Â  Before returning to Calhoun County, Tucker filed a\r\n  motion to dismiss the indictments based on a violation of the Interstate\r\n  Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD). Tucker argued solely under IAD Article IV(e),\r\n  the â€œanti-shuttlingâ€ provision, that his three indictments should be\r\n  dismissed.Â  After hearing arguments from both sides, the trial court ruled that\r\n  the purpose of the IAD, the timely disposition of charges, was not accomplished\r\n  upon Tuckerâ€™s February visit and as such the anti-shuttling provision of the\r\n  IAD did not apply to Tucker.\r\nAfter\r\n  the trial court denied his motion to dismiss, Tucker entered into negotiations\r\n  with the solicitor.Â  Tucker subsequently pled guilty in return for a recommended\r\n  sentence of seven years. Included in the plea agreement were a waiver of\r\n  Tuckerâ€™s right to file an appeal on his IAD motion and a waiver of his right to\r\n  file for post conviction relief (PCR).Â  Tucker waived both of these rights\r\n  several times during the trial courtâ€™s plea colloquy.Â  Tucker now appeals his\r\n  conviction and seeks to vacate his plea on the two rights he waived in the plea\r\n  agreement, namely, an appeal regarding the IAD motion and an appeal of his\r\n  waiver of the right to file a PCR.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Interstate Agreement on\r\n  Detainers\r\nTucker\r\n  asserts Article IV(e) of the IAD was violated and the trial court erred by not\r\n  dismissing the charges against him in light of the IAD violation.Â  We find\r\n  Tucker waived any such IAD violation by entering a guilty plea and expressly\r\n  waived the right to appeal any such violation under the terms of his guilty\r\n  plea.  \r\nThe\r\n  IAD is an interstate compact by which the states, the District of Columbia, and\r\n  the Federal Government have established uniform procedures for the transfer of\r\n  prisoners serving sentences in one state to another state[1] for the disposition of pending charges.Â  South Carolina enacted the IAD into\r\n  law in 1962. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-11-10 (2006).Â   \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003), this court found\r\n  that a violation of the IAD does not deprive a court of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Numerous courts have held\r\n  the rights created by the IAD are statutory in nature and do not rise to the\r\n  level of constitutionally guaranteed rights.Â  Pethel v. McBride, 219 W.Va. 578, 638 S.E.2d 727 (2006); U.S. v. Black, 609 F.2d 1330 (9th Cir. 1979), certiorari denied 101 S.Ct. 132, 449\r\n    U.S. 847, 66 L.Ed.2d 56 (â€œthe protections of the IAD are not founded\r\n  on constitutional rights, or the preservation of a fair trial, but are designed\r\n  to facilitate a defendantâ€™s rehabilitation in prison and to avoid disruptions\r\n  caused when charges are outstanding against the prisoner in another\r\n  jurisdictionâ€); Camp v. U.S., 587, F.2d 397, 400 (8th Cir.\r\n  1978) (holding the IAD is a statutory set of rules and does not amount to\r\n  constitutionally guaranteed rights); Diggs v. Owens, 833 F.2d 439, 442\r\n  (3rd Cir. 1987) (holding the IAD is a set of procedural rules, the\r\n  violation of which does not infringe a constitutional right); Reed v. Clark,\r\n  984 F.2d 209, 210 (7th Cir. 1993) (holding IAD procedures are not\r\n  constitutional rights).Â  The United States Court of Appeals for the\r\n  Third Circuit has held the IAD â€œconstitutes nothing more than a set of\r\n  procedural rules.â€ U.S. v. Palmer, 574 F.2d 164, 167 (3rd Cir. 1978).Â  The statutory right to dismissal due to an administrative\r\n  violation of these rules is therefore not â€œfundamental,â€ even though its impact\r\n  on a defendant may be great.â€ Id. (citing Blackledge v. Perry,\r\n  417 U.S. 21, 30 (1974)).\r\nTucker\r\n  contends Article IV(e)[2] of the IAD was violated when he was transferred to South Carolina custody in\r\n  March 2006 for disposition of the same charges he faced during a February 2006\r\n  appearance in a South Carolina court.Â  In the interim, Tucker was returned to\r\n  Edgefield Federal Correctional Institution, his â€œoriginal place of imprisonmentâ€\r\n  under the terms of the IAD. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-11-10, Art. IV(e) (2006).Â \r\n  Tucker argues under Alabama v. Bozeman, 533 U.S. 146 (2001), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court held â€œevery prisoner arrival in the receiving\r\n  State, whether followed by a very brief stay or a very long stay in the\r\n  receiving State, triggers IV(e)â€™s â€˜no returnâ€™ requirement,â€ and thus Tuckerâ€™s\r\n  return to South Carolina custody was in violation of the IAD. 533 U.S. at 154 (emphasis in original).\r\nThe\r\n  case sub judice is distinguished from Bozeman by the fact that\r\n  Tucker proceeded to enter a guilty plea following the denial of his motion to\r\n  dismiss.Â  Guilty pleas â€œgenerally act as a waiver[3] of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses.â€ State v. Thomason, 341\r\n  S.C. 524, 526, 534 S.E.2d 708, 710 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Munsch,\r\n  287 S.C. 313, 338 S.E.2d 329 (1985)).Â  In United\r\n    States v. Broce, the Supreme Court discussed guilty pleas and their\r\n  implications as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the\r\n  factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of\r\n  guilt and a lawful sentence. Accordingly, when the judgment of conviction upon\r\n  a guilty plea has become final and the offender seeks to reopen the proceeding,\r\n  the inquiry is ordinarily confined to whether the underlying plea was both\r\n  counseled and voluntary. If the answer is in the affirmative then the\r\n  conviction and the plea, as a general rule, foreclose the collateral attack.\r\n  There are exceptions where on the face of the record the court had no power to\r\n  enter the conviction or impose the sentence.[4] \r\n\r\n488 U.S. 563, 565 (1989).\r\nIn United States v. Palmer, the Court of Appeals for the\r\n  Third Circuit addressed the question we do now, namely, whether a defendant may\r\n  complain about violations of Article IV(e) of the IAD after pleading guilty\r\n  without reservation. 574 F.2d 164 (3rd Cir. 1978).Â  That court noted\r\n  that â€œalthough [defendant] moved to dismiss the indictment before sentencing,\r\n  he was not willing to surrender [the] benefits [of pleading guilty] by seeking\r\n  to withdraw his plea and â€˜take his chancesâ€™ on the outcome of his IAD motion.â€ Palmer,\r\n  574 F.2d at 166.\r\nWe hold that by proceeding with his guilty plea, Tucker waived any\r\n  and all defects regarding his return to state custody under the IAD.Â  In addition to implicitly waiving any violation of the\r\n  IAD by entering a guilty plea, we also find that Tucker expressly waived his\r\n  right to appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling on his IAD motion under the terms of\r\n  his guilty plea.Â   \r\nWhen the trial\r\n  court asked Tucker if he would like to enter a guilty plea or proceed to trial,\r\n  Tucker hesitated, conferred with counsel, and then proposed a guilty plea in\r\n  which he would â€œwaive his right to appeal that motion, and would plea in\r\n  exchange for a seven year sentence.â€[5] Â After the State agreed to Tuckerâ€™s plea offer, the trial court reviewed the\r\n  plea agreement during the plea colloquy:\r\n\r\n\tIn that\r\n  agreement the state has agreed to recommend a sentence in this case of seven\r\n  years in exchange for you waiving your right to file any appeal on the motion,\r\n  and you are also waiving your right to file any post conviction relief.Â  In\r\n  other words, you would not be allowed to appeal, or you would accept the\r\n  decision madeâ€¦ by the court earlier today in regards to the Interstate\r\n  Detainers Act. \r\n\r\nâ€œIt is the prerogative of any person to waive his rights, confess,\r\n  and plead guilty, under judicially defined safeguards, which are adequately\r\n  enforced.â€ Reed v. Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 685, 511 S.E.2d 396, 401 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999) (quoting State v. Armstrong, 263 S.C. 594, 597, 211 S.E.2d\r\n  889, 890 (1975)).Â  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\r\n  has held that a defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is\r\n  knowing and intelligent. U.S. v. Blick, 408 F.3d 162, 169 (4th Cir. 2005).Â  \r\n \r\nA guilty plea must also be knowingly and intelligently entered\r\n  into in order to be valid. State v. Boykin, 395 U.S. 238 (1969).Â  To knowingly and voluntarily enter a guilty plea a defendant must have a full\r\n  understanding of the charges against them and the consequences of the plea. State\r\n    v. Rikard, 371 S.C. 295, 300, 638 S.E.2d 72, 75 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  An\r\n  appellate court will review the totality of the circumstances to discern if a\r\n  plea was entered into knowingly and intelligently.Â  Hughey v. State, 255\r\n  S.C. 155, 157-58, 177 S.E.2d 553, 555 (1970).  \r\nAt the time of the guilty plea Tucker told the trial court he was\r\n  thirty-four years old, not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and not\r\n  coerced or promised anything in return for his plea. Tucker also showed a high level of savvy regarding the\r\n  criminal justice system by presenting and arguing his motion to dismiss on the\r\n  IAD although his attorneys were present.Â  The trial court questioned Tuckerâ€™s\r\n  understanding of the seven year sentence under his plea agreement instead of\r\n  the fifteen year sentence in the stateâ€™s original plea offer or the twenty year\r\n  sentence he faced if convicted at trial. Tucker answered that he agreed to\r\n  accept the seven years proposed in his plea agreement. We\r\n  find further proof that Tucker knowingly and intelligently entered into this\r\n  guilty plea expressly waiving his right to appeal his IAD motion since Tucker\r\n  is the one who conceived of and proposed this plea agreement.  \r\nII.\r\n  Post-Conviction Relief\r\nTucker\r\n  asserts the trial court erred by accepting a plea agreement made unreasonable\r\n  by a waiver of future post-conviction claims in addition to a waiver of the\r\n  right to appeal.Â  This issue is not ripe for our review.\r\nTuckerâ€™s\r\n  assertion presents the novel issue of whether a criminal defendant can waive\r\n  his ability to file for post-conviction relief (PCR) in a guilty plea where the\r\n  right to file an appeal is also waived.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has\r\n  held PCRs can be waived but the court has only addressed such a waiver in\r\n  capital cases after a prisoner has filed a PCR application.Â  Hughes v. State,Â  367 S.C. 389, 395, 626 S.E.2d 805, 808 (2006) (â€œThe\r\n  Court will issue an execution notice after that person either has exhausted all\r\n  appeals and other avenues of post-conviction relief in state and federal\r\n  courts, or after that person, who is determined by this Court to be mentally\r\n  competent, knowingly and voluntarily waives such appeals.â€); State v. Downs,\r\n  369 S.C. 55, 631 S.E.2d 79 (2006) (holding appellant is competent to waive his\r\n  appeals and be executed as his decision to waive those appeals is knowing and\r\n  voluntary).Â  In Downs the supreme court allowed a prisoner to waive his\r\n  PCR upon the finding he was competent to do so.Â  This issue was presented to\r\n  the supreme court after Downs had been convicted, sentenced, and filed a PCR\r\n  application.Â   \r\nWhile we are mindful of the supreme courtâ€™s rulings in capital\r\n  cases such as Downs, those matters are distinguishable from the present\r\n  case by the fact that specific PCR applications, not the prospective ability to\r\n  file a PCR, were waived.Â  In the matter sub judice we find the issue of\r\n  Tuckerâ€™s waiver of his right to file a prospective PCR application is beyond\r\n  the purview of this court as an error correcting authority. See State v. Elmore, 368 S.C. 230, 238, 628 S.E.2d 271, 275 (Ct. App. 2006) (recognizing the supreme court as the arbiter of legal\r\n  policy).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act provides a procedural framework for\r\n  collaterally attacking convictions and sentences. Al-Shabazz v. State,\r\n  338 S.C. 354, 366, 527 S.E.2d 742, 748 (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20 (2006).Â \r\n  Tucker has not sought post-conviction relief yet. The state has conceded that\r\n  if and when Tucker should attempt to file a PCR application, Tucker could raise\r\n  the issue of whether his plea agreement was made unreasonable by a waiver of post-conviction\r\n  claims.Â  Since Tucker has yet to file for post-conviction relief, we find the current\r\n  issue is not ripe for our review and we therefore decline to address it.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the trial court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Article II(a) of the IAD explains, â€œâ€˜Stateâ€™ shall mean a State of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.â€\r\n[2] If trial is not had on any indictment, information,\r\n  or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the\r\n  original place of imprisonment pursuant to article V(e) hereof, such\r\n  indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or\r\n  effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\r\n  S.C.

Dana Sinkler, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Charleston Southern University (the University) and Lowcountry Open Land Trust (Buyer)\r\n  entered into a contract for the sale and purchase, respectively, of real\r\n  property in Dorchester County, South Carolina.Â  The University is the\r\n  principal, but not sole, owner of the real property.Â  The University attempted\r\n  to terminate the contract, resulting in an action by Buyer for specific\r\n  performance.Â  The master-in-equity rescinded the Universityâ€™s purported\r\n  termination of the contract and ordered the parties to renegotiate their\r\n  contract and enter into a â€œwritten\r\n  extension agreement.â€Â  The purpose of the extension agreement was to provide\r\n  additional time within which to ascertain the varying ownership interests of\r\n  the multiple property owners.Â  The University appeals.Â  We affirm the master\r\n  only insofar as the Universityâ€™s interest in the property is concerned.Â  We\r\n  reverse that portion of the order requiring the parties to renegotiate their\r\n  contract.Â  The result of our holding is to grant specific performance as to the\r\n  Universityâ€™s undivided interest in the property.\r\nI.\r\nThe University and\r\n  Buyer entered into the contract on October 27, 2004, for approximately 63.38\r\n  acres of land located near Summerville in Dorchester County, South Carolina.Â \r\n  The University represented that it owned 61.70% of the property, and provided\r\n  the Buyer a list of twenty-seven other institutions and individual owners that\r\n  it believed held the remaining interest.[1]Â \r\n  The contract called for a total purchase price of $325,000, payable to each\r\n  individual owner agreeing to the sale, including the University, in an amount\r\n  to be determined in accordance with each ownerâ€™s interest in the\r\n  property.Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nBoth the University\r\n  and Buyer were aware of the unusual title and ownership issues.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  contract provided various options in the event Buyer was unable to obtain the\r\n  complete ownership interest in the property.Â  For example, in the event there\r\n  were any deficiencies in title, Buyer could give notice to the University to\r\n  cure such deficiencies.Â  If the University was unable or unwilling to cure the\r\n  claimed defects in title, or â€œin the failure of any Buyerâ€™s contingency\r\n  described,â€ Buyer could elect to cancel the contract or to â€œ[a]ccept such title\r\n  and/or condition of Property as [the University] can convey as performance in\r\n  full.â€Â  Thus, in the event Buyer was unable to obtain deeds conveying the full\r\n  ownership interest from the remaining owners, Buyer could cancel the contract\r\n  or take a deed from the University for its undivided interest in the property.Â \r\n  Moreover, Buyer could purchase the interest of other property owners who would\r\n  be willing to convey their ownership interest to Buyer.Â  In this regard, to\r\n  help determine title, the University agreed to contact the other owners and\r\n  attempt to obtain their agreement to sell their interest in the property.[2]Â   \r\nThe contract also\r\n  included two timeline provisions:Â  (1) an â€œInspection Period,â€ which was to\r\n  last for sixty days from the October 29, 2004 delivery date of the contract;\r\n  and (2) a â€œTitle Examination Period,â€ which was to begin on the expiration of\r\n  the Inspection Period and continue until the thirtieth day thereafter.Â  The\r\n  contract further provided that the closing date should take place â€œon or before\r\n  the expiration date of the Title Examination Period (or the first business day\r\n  thereafter if such date shall be a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday) at the\r\n  office of Buyerâ€™s attorney, or at such other date or place as the parties may\r\n  agree in writing.â€Â  The parties agreed the Title Examination Period expired no\r\n  later than January 31, 2005.Â  Thus, the projected closing date was January 31,\r\n  2005.Â  The contract did not include a â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ provision.Â \r\n \r\nOnce the parties\r\n  signed the contract, both the University and Buyer undertook efforts to verify\r\n  the other owners of the property.Â  On October 28, 2004, Buyer contacted Sidney\r\n  Jones, a title abstractor, to perform the title search.Â  Shortly after Jones\r\n  received the order, Jones told Buyer that he could not complete the work in the\r\n  time required due to his busy schedule and the number of owners he would have\r\n  to research.Â  Meanwhile, the University mailed a letter to all known owners\r\n  asking for information as to how they acquired title to the property and\r\n  seeking their consent to the sale of their property interest under the\r\n  contract.Â  On or about January 17, 2005, the parties discussed the status of\r\n  consents the University had received from the other owners.[3]Â \r\n  The projected closing date of January 31, 2005 passed without the parties\r\n  closing on the contract.\r\nOn March 11, 2005,\r\n  Sue Mitchell, Vice President for Business Affairs at the University, directed\r\n  William Bates, the Universityâ€™s attorney, to check on the status of the\r\n  contract so she could make a report to the Universityâ€™s Board of Trustees at\r\n  the next scheduled board meeting.Â  Bates contacted John Warren, III, Buyerâ€™s\r\n  attorney, who advised Bates that Buyer was waiting for the completed title\r\n  work.Â  Later that same day, Warren e-mailed Bates requesting an extension of\r\n  the contract.Â  Bates forwarded the request to Mitchell, who in return directed\r\n  Bates to issue a letter terminating the contract.Â Â Â   \r\nBates\r\n  sent a termination letter to Buyer on March 23, 2005.Â  Buyer responded by\r\n  filing this declaratory judgment action seeking specific performance on April\r\n  11, 2005.Â  Notwithstanding the filing of this declaratory judgment action, on\r\n  April 13, 2005, Bates delivered to Warren a copy of a Trust Agreement with\r\n  respect to the property.Â  The next day, Warren wrote to acknowledge receipt,\r\n  stating he would forward the document to Buyerâ€™s title examiner and he hoped\r\n  this would be â€œjust what we have been looking for to help establish the current\r\n  ownership.â€Â   \r\nOn\r\n  May 5, 2005, Buyer tendered a check to the University for $190,525 to purchase\r\n  the interest owned by the University.Â  The tendered check of $190,525 plus\r\n  $10,000 in earnest money Buyer had previously paid equaled $200,525, which is\r\n  61.70% of the total purchase price of $325,000.Â  The University did not accept\r\n  the money and refused to quitclaim its interest in the property to Buyer.Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe case proceeded\r\n  to trial.Â  In his final order, the master found (1) the contract did not\r\n  include a â€œtime was of the essenceâ€ provision, and (2) the University had\r\n  waived its right to enforce the closing date based on its actions after January\r\n  31, 2005.Â  As a result, the master rescinded the Universityâ€™s termination of\r\n  the contract and ordered the parties to renegotiate an extension of the\r\n  contract.Â Â  The University appeals.Â   \r\nII.\r\nBuyer filed a\r\n  declaratory judgment action.Â  â€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal\r\n  nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts\r\n    v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  To make\r\n  this determination, the appellate court must look to the essential character of\r\n  the cause of action.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343\r\n  S.C. 140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The character of the\r\n  action is generally ascertained from the body of the complaint, but when\r\n  necessary, â€œresort may also be had to the prayer for relief and any other facts\r\n  and circumstances which throw light upon the main purpose of the action.â€Â  Ins.\r\n    Fin. Servs., Inc. v. S.C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318\r\n  (1978); In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 278, 539 S.E.2d 703, 709\r\n  (2000) (citing Bell v. Mackey, 191 S.C. 105, 119, 3 S.E.2d 816, 824\r\n  (1939) (â€œThe nature of the issues as raised by the pleadings or the pleadings\r\n  and proof, and character of relief sought under them, determines the character\r\n  of an action as legal or equitable.â€)).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Buyer primarily asserted a claim for specific performance.[4]Â \r\n  An action for specific performance lies in equity.Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s\r\n    Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 290 (2000).Â  In an appeal from\r\n  an action in equity, tried by a judge alone, this court may find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Barnacle\r\n    Broadcasting, Inc., 343 S.C. at 146, 538 S.E.2d at 675.Â Â   \r\nIII.\r\nA.&nbsp; Specific\r\n  Performance\r\nThe\r\n  University claims the master erred in rescinding its termination of the\r\n  contract because Buyer was not ready, willing, and able to perform its\r\n  obligations under the contract on the closing date.Â  We disagree insofar as the\r\n  Universityâ€™s undivided interest in the property is concerned.Â  We agree with\r\n  the master that Buyerâ€™s failure to close on the projected closing date did not\r\n  entitle the University to terminate the contract because time was not of the\r\n  essence under the contract.Â  It is well settled that time is not of the essence\r\n  in a contract to convey land unless made so by its terms expressly or by\r\n  implication.Â  Faulkner v. Millar, 319 S.C. 216, 219, 460 S.E.2d 378, 380\r\n  (1995).Â  â€œWhen the contract does not include a provision that â€˜time is of the\r\n  essence,â€™ the law implies that it is to be done within a reasonable time.â€Â  Id.Â  Under the circumstances presented here, Buyer had a reasonable time to complete\r\n  performance of the contract.Â   \r\nThe masterâ€™s\r\n  decision to rescind the Universityâ€™s termination of the contract is buttressed\r\n  by other provisions in the contract and the conduct of the parties after\r\n  January 31, 2005.Â  For example, the contract included a provision allowing the\r\n  parties to agree to an alternative closing date.Â  Further, the conduct of the\r\n  University after the projected closing date shows that the University did not\r\n  believe time was of the essence.Â  More than a month after the projected closing\r\n  date, University Vice President Mitchell contacted Bates about the contract. Â Significantly,\r\n  Mitchell contacted Bates to determine the status of the contract, not to\r\n  declare a termination of the contract.Â  It was only after Buyer requested a\r\n  formal extension of the contract that the University advised Buyer that its\r\n  delay under the contract entitled the University to terminate the contract.Â \r\n  Additionally, even after this lawsuit was filed, the Universityâ€™s attorney\r\n  provided documentation to Buyerâ€™s attorney, which indicates there was a\r\n  continuing effort to complete the transaction. Â \r\nâ€œ[A] seller will\r\n  not be permitted to declare a forfeiture of the rights of the buyer for\r\n  nonperformance of any of the vital terms or conditions of the contract where\r\n  such nonperformance has been with the express or clearly evinced tacit or\r\n  implied consent of the seller.â€Â  Faulkner, 319 S.C. at 221, 460 S.E.2d\r\n  at 381.Â  Accordingly, we find the Universityâ€™s communications and actions after\r\n  January 31, 2005, demonstrate the tacit or implied consent of the University to\r\n  Buyerâ€™s nonperformance.Â   \r\nBy rescinding the\r\n  Universityâ€™s termination of the contract, the master, in effect, granted Buyer\r\n  specific performance.Â  â€œIn order to\r\n  compel specific performance, a court of equity must find: (1) there is clear\r\n  evidence of a valid agreement; (2) the agreement had been partly carried into\r\n  execution on one side with the approbation of the other; and (3) the party who\r\n  comes to compel performance has performed his or her part, or has been and\r\n  remains able and willing to perform his or her part of the contract.â€Â  Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 262, 603 S.E.2d 625, 628 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n  The party seeking to compel specific performance â€œmust be able to perform at\r\n  the exact time he requested specific performance, not some â€˜reasonable timeâ€™ in\r\n  the future.â€Â  Ingram, 340 S.C. at 106 n.1, 531 S.E.2d at 291 n.1.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  master found specific performance was appropriate as to the Universityâ€™s\r\n  interest because Buyer attempted to close on the contract by waiving the title\r\n  search and exercising its option under the contract to purchase only the\r\n  Universityâ€™s interest.Â  Paragraph 5 of the contract, entitled â€œTitle\r\n  Examination,â€ provides in relevant part as follows:  \r\n\r\n\tBuyer\r\n  shall examine title to the Property during the â€œTitle Examination Periodâ€ . . .\r\n  .Â  In the event there are any deficiencies in the title . . . Buyer shall give\r\n  written notice to [the University] . . . .Â  In the event that the [University]\r\n  is unable or unwilling to cure any claimed defect in title to the Property, or\r\n  in the failure of any Buyerâ€™s contingency described, the Buyer may elect either\r\n  of the following as Buyerâ€™s sole and exclusive remedy . . . i) Cancel the\r\n  within Agreement . . . ; or ii) Accept such title and/or condition of\r\n    Property as [the University] can convey as performance in full.Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nBuyer\r\n  unquestionably was willing and able to purchase the Universityâ€™s undivided\r\n  interest in the property as evidenced by the tender of $190,525.Â  Therefore,\r\n  under the terms of the contract, Buyer could at its option forgo a title\r\n  search, pay the University, and accept a quitclaim deed from the University.Â \r\n  We concur in the masterâ€™s grant of specific performance to the extent he\r\n  required the University to convey its undivided interest in the property to\r\n  Buyer.\r\nThe\r\n  Universityâ€™s final argument to defeat specific performance arises from its\r\n  claim that the title examination was a condition precedent to its obligation to\r\n  convey its undivided interest in the property.Â  A condition precedent to a\r\n  contract is â€œany fact other than the lapse of time, which, unless excused, must\r\n  exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance arises.â€Â  Worley v.\r\n    Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994).Â  â€œThe question of whether a provision in a contract constitutes a\r\n  condition precedent is a question of construction dependent on the intent of\r\n  the parties to be gathered from the language they employ.â€Â  Id.Â \r\n  (internal quotation omitted).\r\nWe\r\n  hold, as did the master, that the provisions concerning the title examination\r\n  do not rise to the level of a condition precedent.Â  As noted above, the\r\n  contract extended Buyer certain options in the event of title deficiencies,\r\n  including the right to â€œ[a]ccept such title and/or condition of Property\r\n  as [the University] can convey as performance in full.â€ Buyer proceeded at its\r\n  own peril in electing this bargained-for option under the contract and\r\n  tendering to the University 61.70% of the purchase price in exchange for a\r\n  quitclaim deed from the University.\r\nBefore\r\n  moving to the next issue, we do recognize that much of the Universityâ€™s\r\n  argument here centers on the varying interests of the other property owners.Â \r\n  Clearly, the interests of the other property owners cannot be determined\r\n  without a proper title examination.Â  Buyer does not contend otherwise in the\r\n  claim for specific performance against the University.Â  As far as its rights\r\n  under Paragraph 5 of the contract, Buyer simply seeks to enforce its\r\n  contractual right to â€œaccept such title . . . as [the University] can convey.â€ Â As\r\n  discussed below, we affirm the masterâ€™s order only to the extent it grants\r\n  specific performance to the Universityâ€™s undivided interest in the property. \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; The Extension\r\n  Agreement \r\nThe University\r\n  contends the master had no authority to order the parties to enter into an\r\n  undefined and indefinite extension agreement.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  masterâ€™s order instructed the University to rescind its termination of the\r\n  contract and for â€œboth parties to execute an appropriate written extension\r\n  agreement.â€Â  What is â€œappropriateâ€ is unknown.Â  The purpose of the extension\r\n  agreement concerned an undefined extension of time in which to determine the\r\n  ownership interests of the remaining owners.Â  It is one thing for a court to\r\n  impose a reasonable time period in a contract (based on the particular facts presented)\r\n  where time is not of the essence; it is quite another for a court to order the\r\n  parties to enter into a new agreement.Â  We are unaware of any legal authority,\r\n  and none has been cited to us, permitting a court to order parties to\r\n  renegotiate contract terms and enter into a new agreement.[5]Â   \r\nCourts\r\n  only have the authority to specifically enforce contracts that the parties\r\n  themselves have made; they do not have the authority to alter contracts or to\r\n  make new contracts for the parties.Â  Amick v. Hagler,&nbsp;286 S.C. 481,\r\n  485, 334 S.E.2d 525, 527&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985) (holding the trial judge properly\r\n  granted specific performance, but did not have the authority to give one party\r\n  the option of requiring the other party to provide owner financing because this\r\n  was not part of the partiesâ€™ contract).\r\nParties\r\n  have the right to make their own contracts.Â  Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,&nbsp;264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d 547, 550&nbsp;(1975); MailSource,\r\n    LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs., 356 S.C. 363, 369, 588 S.E.2d 635, 638-39&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2003) (stating, as a matter of first impression, that the appellate court\r\n  would decline to adopt a procedure used in other jurisdictions that extended\r\n  the non-compete period following a partyâ€™s breach to ensure the nonbreaching\r\n  party received the benefit of the bargain, the court stating there is no\r\n  support for such an extension under South Carolina law because it would, in\r\n  effect, rewrite the contract).Â   \r\nSuccinctly\r\n  stated, a court has no authority to rewrite a contract and impose unwanted obligations\r\n  and terms under the guise of specific performance or judicial construction.Â \r\n  Therefore, we reverse the portion of the masterâ€™s order requiring the parties\r\n  to renegotiate and enter into a new written extension agreement.Â  See, e.g., Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 171, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363\r\n  (2002) (â€œIt is not the function of the court to rewrite contracts for\r\n  parties.â€); E. Bus. Forms, Inc. v. Kistler, 258 S.C. 429, 189 S.E.2d 22\r\n  (1972) (finding the court may not make a new agreement for the parties into\r\n  which they did not voluntarily enter).Â   \r\nC.&nbsp; Failure to Include Legal Authority\r\nThe University\r\n  asserts the masterâ€™s failure to support his conclusions of law with any legal\r\n  authority is an error of law warranting reversal.Â  We agree that the master\r\n  failed to cite to any legal authority in his order.Â  We do not find, however,\r\n  that the lack of citation to legal authorities rises to the level of reversible\r\n  error.Â  This case was factually intensive, and the masterâ€™s order discusses in\r\n  detail the facts considered in making a decision to grant specific performance\r\n  to Buyer of the Universityâ€™s undivided interest.Â  While it may be unusual for a\r\n  trial court not to cite legal authority to support its conclusions, the master\r\n  generally discussed applicable legal concepts, such as whether time was of the\r\n  essence in the contract, whether Buyer and the University acted in good faith,\r\n  and whether the parties performed their obligations under the contract before\r\n  concluding specific performance should be granted.Â  We find no reversible\r\n  error.  \r\nIV.\r\nWe affirm the\r\n  masterâ€™s grant of specific performance as to the Universityâ€™s undivided\r\n  interest in the property.Â  We reverse the part of the order requiring the parties\r\n  to execute a new written extension agreement.Â  We therefore affirm the order\r\n  requiring the University to convey its ownership interest to Buyer.  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.Â  \r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  There is some variation on this point as the record\r\n  also contains a reference to twenty-eight other owners.Â   \r\n[2]Â  The contract expressly provided, however, that the\r\n  University made no representation or warranty that it would, in fact, be able\r\n  to deliver such agreements from the other owners.Â Â Â   \r\n[3]Â  According to a chart prepared by the University, as\r\n  of January 17, 2005, ten people had sent completed information and signed\r\n  consents to the sale of the property; one person had met with a University\r\n  official; six people had no information about how they acquired their interest;\r\n  three people referred the University to other sources; and seven people had not\r\n  yet responded.Â   \r\n[4]&nbsp; On appeal, the Buyer asserts the master was\r\n  interpreting the contract, so the action is one at law and this courtâ€™s scope\r\n  of review should extend only to the correction of errors of law.Â  As previously\r\n  discussed, although Buyer alleged a claim of breach of contract, the relief\r\n  sought is specific performance.Â  This is an action in equity.\r\n[5]Â  Moreover, it appears as of the time of trial Buyer\r\n  had not determined the varying ownership interests of the multiple remaining\r\n  owners.Â  Thus, Buyer was in no position to perform under the contract even as\r\n  late as the trial.Â  Under these circumstances, we would decline to grant Buyer\r\n  equitable relief with respect to the remaining property owners.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4337","title":"Cook v.

Â At trial, Grandfather and Mother presented\r\n  evidence regarding Daughterâ€™s residence.Â  Ultimately, the Master concluded Daughter\r\n  did not primarily reside with Grandfather, and therefore, she was not entitled\r\n  to recover the UIM benefits under the policies. Â This appeal follows.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â \r\n  â€œAn issue essentially one at law, will not be transformed into one in equity\r\n  simply because declaratory relief is sought.â€Â  Id. Â In South Carolina,\r\n  an insurance policy is a contract between the insured and the insurance company,\r\n  and the terms of the policy are to be construed according to contract law. Â Estate of Revis by Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 476, 484 S.E.2d\r\n    112, 115 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œContract actions are actions at law.Â  Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 508, 381 S.E.2d\r\n      736, 739 (1989).Â  \r\nOur\r\n  scope of review for a case heard by a master-in-equity who enters a final judgment\r\n  is the same as that for review of a case heard by a circuit court without a\r\n  jury.Â  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60-61, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157\r\n  (1988).Â  Therefore, we may not disturb the masterâ€™s findings of fact unless those\r\n  findings are â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous\r\n  conception or application of the law.â€Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 581, 500 S.E.2d 496, 498 (Ct. App. 1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  determination of resident relative status is a factual finding for the trial\r\n  court.Â  Langford, 330 S.C. at 581, 500 S.E.2d at 497.Â  This finding must\r\n  be affirmed unless no evidence reasonably supports it or the trial court made\r\n  an error of law.Â  Id. at 581, 500 S.E.2d at 498.Â  \r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n\r\nGrandfather\r\n  and Mother argue the Master erred in finding Daughter did not primarily reside\r\n  with Grandfather and, therefore, in finding Daughter was not entitled to UIM\r\n  coverage under Grandfatherâ€™s State Farm policies.Â  Specifically, Grandfather and Mother contend the Master failed to broadly\r\n  construe the applicable clauses of the policies.Â  They maintain under a broader\r\n  construction, the evidence would support a finding that Daughter primarily\r\n  resided with Grandfather.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn South Carolina, clauses of inclusion should be broadly\r\n  construed in favor of coverage, and when there are doubts about the existence\r\n  or extent of coverage, the language of the policy is to be â€œunderstood in its\r\n  most inclusive sense.â€Â  Buddin v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C.\r\n  332, 337-38, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967).Â  Courts should not, however, â€œtorture\r\n  the meaning of policy language in order to extendâ€ or defeat coverage that was â€œnever\r\n  intended by the parties.â€Â  Torrington\r\n    Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1975). Â â€œInsurance policies are subject to\r\n  general rules of contract construction.â€Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 234, 530 S.E.2d 896, 897 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  courts â€œshould give policy language its plain, ordinary and popular meaning.â€Â  Id. Â Â Â \r\nIn the present case, Grandfatherâ€™s three automobile insurance\r\n  policies issued by State Farm are at issue.Â  All three policies contain\r\n  language that extends UIM coverage to Grandfather, his spouse, and his\r\n  relatives.[1]Â \r\n  The policies define a relative as â€œa person related to you or your spouse by\r\n  blood, marriage or adoption who resides primarily with you.â€[2]Â  Giving the policy language its\r\n  plain, ordinary and popular meaning, it is clear to recover under the policy, a\r\n  person must be a relative of the policy holder by â€œblood, marriage or\r\n  adoption,â€ as well as â€œreside[] primarily withâ€ that policy holder.Â  Daughter is\r\n  related to Grandfather by blood; thus, the determinative issue is whether Daughter\r\n  resided â€œprimarily withâ€ Grandfather at the time of the accident.\r\nThe standard for determining whether an individual is a resident\r\n  of the same household was discussed in Buddin, where our Supreme Court stated,\r\n  â€œ[A] resident of the same household is one, other than a temporary or transient\r\n  visitor, who lives together with others in the same house for a period of some\r\n  duration, although he may not intend to remain there permanently.â€ Â 250 S.C. at\r\n  339, 157 S.E.2d at 636 (citing Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Home Indem. Co.,\r\n  50 Cal. Rptr. 508, 514 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1966)).Â  Since Buddin, this\r\n  standard has been applied to varying factual situations,[3] making it clear the resident relative\r\n  analysis depends heavily on the facts of each situation and has no bright line\r\n  test.Â  Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Horne, 356 S.C. 52, 61, 586 S.E.2d 865,\r\n  870 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  \r\nGrandfather and Mother argue the evidence does not support the Masterâ€™s\r\n  findings under the Buddin standard.Â  Specifically, they argue Daughter and Grandfatherâ€™s â€œuniqueâ€ living\r\n  arrangement comprised a singular residence.Â  Ample\r\n  evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the mobile home and the house\r\n  were separate residences. The parties stipulated Grandfather lived with his\r\n  wife in a two bedroom house located in Galivants Ferry, South Carolina.Â  Grandfather\r\n  owned the surrounding real estate.Â  A mobile home owned by Mother and her\r\n  husband, Billy Ray Smith (Father), was also located on the same property.Â  The\r\n  two structures had separate property tax assessments, electrical services,\r\n  phone services, septic tanks, and insurance policies. Â Mother and Father owned\r\n  the mobile home, while Grandfather owned the house.Â  Further, testimony\r\n  indicated the two structures were physically separate with a fence between\r\n  them.Â  Father testified he and Mother paid $100 a month in rent to Grandfather.Â \r\n  The record also reveals the bills and expenses for the two homes were paid separately.\r\n  Â While Grandfather testified he helped pay the bills for the mobile home\r\n  for a period of time, he confessed he only did so to help Mother and Father\r\n  because they could not afford to pay the bills.Â  Lastly, there was testimony Father\r\n  stayed in the mobile home exclusively and did not consider the two homes to be\r\n  a single residence.Â  Accordingly, we find that evidence supports the\r\n  conclusion the mobile home and house were in fact two separate residences.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, evidence supports the Masterâ€™s conclusion that Daughter resided\r\n  primarily in the mobile home and not in the house with Grandfather.Â  Several\r\n  witnesses testified Daughter, along with her parents and siblings, lived in the\r\n  mobile home, and Grandfather and his wife lived in the house.Â  The record also\r\n  shows the majority of the family possessions of Mother and Father were stored\r\n  in the mobile home, and Daughter and her siblings only kept a few toys and a\r\n  change of clothes in Grandfatherâ€™s house.Â  Grandfatherâ€™s wife testified that she\r\n  would care for the children while Mother was away, and the children would leave\r\n  Grandfatherâ€™s house and return to the mobile home as soon as Mother returned\r\n  home.Â  Therefore, we find the Master did not err in concluding Daughter did not\r\n  primarily reside with Grandfather.Â  Accordingly, we find the Master properly\r\n  found Daughter was not entitled to UIM benefits under Grandfatherâ€™s insurance policies.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Master is \r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nANDERSON and\r\n  SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The coverage also extends to permissive occupants and\r\n  users of the covered automobiles; however, this policy language is not\r\n  applicable in the instant case.Â   \r\n[2] The policyâ€™s definition of relative also includes\r\n  â€œunmarried and unemancipatedâ€ children\r\n  who are â€œaway at school.â€Â  This policy language, however, is not applicable in\r\n  the instant case.\r\n[3] See Auto-Owners Ins.

Jefferson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4338\r\nHeard November 7, 2007 â€“ Filed January 17,\r\n2008\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Patrick F. Stringer, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n        Timothy A. Domin, William L. Howard, Sr., Stephen L. Brown, and\r\n          Russell G. Hines, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, J:Â  Friends\r\n  of McLeod, Inc. (Friends) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s determination that its\r\n  appeal was untimely and that it lacked standing to appeal the decision of the City\r\n  of Charleston Board of Zoning Appeals (Board) granting the American College of the Building Arts (College) a special exception.Â  Friends also argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to find the Board acted arbitrarily and abused its\r\n  discretion in granting the special exception.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nOriginally, this matter began with a\r\n  request by the College to Charleston City Council to rezone McLeod Plantation\r\n  to a School (S) Overlay Zone district. Â At the time the area was zoned\r\n  residential.Â  The request arose from the Collegeâ€™s desire to purchase the\r\n  McLeod Plantation from the Historic Charleston Foundation (Foundation) and\r\n  establish a small college devoted exclusively to teaching construction and\r\n  preservation techniques on old and/or historic structures. Â Charleston City\r\n  Council approved the rezoning.Â  The College then applied to the Board for a\r\n  special exception to operate the College within the School (S) Overlay Zone\r\n  district. Â Both proponents and opponents heavily attended the Boardâ€™s hearing\r\n  on the exception.Â  After hearing the Collegeâ€™s proposal, the Board initially\r\n  denied the special exception.Â  Immediately thereafter, a Board member made a motion\r\n  to allow the special exception upon the condition the College operate with no\r\n  more than one hundred persons, including students, faculty, and staff. Â The\r\n  Board then voted to grant the exception. Â Subsequently, Friends, a collective\r\n  group of individuals, requested the Board reconsider its approval.Â  The Board denied\r\n  Friendsâ€™ motion to reconsider, and Friends appealed to the circuit court. \r\nFriends filed its initial appeal within the thirty-day time limit\r\n  prescribed by statute, but the summons and complaint named only the City of Charleston (City) and the Board as parties.Â  Several months later, Friends filed a motion\r\n  to amend the complaint and, pursuant to a consent order, joined the College as\r\n  a party. Â The circuit court found Friends did not timely perfect its appeal\r\n  because Friends failed to name College, a necessary party in the action, as a party\r\n  within the thirty-day time period for appeals allowed in decisions from a\r\n  zoning board. Â Additionally, the court found Friends neither had standing nor suffered\r\n  any individualized harm based on the record presented to the Board. Â In the\r\n  interests of judicial economy, the circuit court affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision on\r\n  the merits. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[T]he findings of\r\n  fact by the Board shall be treated in the same manner as findings of fact by a\r\n  jury, and the court may not take additional evidence.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2006).Â  See also Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals\r\n    for City of Beaufort, 346 S.C. 401, 405, 552 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n  Â In reviewing the questions presented by the appeal, the court shall determine\r\n  only whether the decision of the Board is correct as a matter of law. Â Id. Â Furthermore, â€œ[a] court will refrain from substituting its judgment for that of\r\n  the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with the decision.â€ Â Rest. Row\r\n    Assocs. v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 216, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446 (1999). Â â€œHowever,\r\n  a decision of a municipal zoning board will be overturned if it is arbitrary,\r\n  capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful purpose, or if the board has\r\n  abused its discretion.â€ Â Id.Â  The timeliness of an appeal from a zoning\r\n  boardâ€™s decision is a jurisdictional requirement and, as such, may be raised at\r\n  any time by either party or sua sponte by this court. Â Vulcan Materials Co.\r\n    v. Greenville County Bd. of Zoning AppealsÂ­, 342 S.C. 480, 489, 536 S.E. 2d\r\n  892, 896 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs a threshold\r\n  issue Friends asserts the circuit court erred in holding the appeal was\r\n  untimely because Friends failed to include College as a proper party.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder South Carolina law:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    person who may have a substantial interest in any decision of the board of\r\n    appeals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may appeal from a decision of the board to the circuit\r\n    court .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by filing with the clerk of the court a petition in\r\n    writing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [and said] appeal must be filed within thirty days\r\n    after the decision of the board is mailed.\r\n\r\nFriends maintains the statuteâ€™s\r\n  only requirement is that the appeal be filed within the thirty-day time period.Â \r\n  Having timely filed its appeal, Friends argues, a party should be able to amend\r\n  its pleadings to add a necessary party to the lawsuit.\r\nOur supreme court has\r\n  announced that development permittees are necessary parties to appeals of their\r\n  respective permits.Â  Spanish Wells Property Owners Assâ€™n v. Bd. of\r\n    Adjustment of the Town of Hilton Head Island, 295 S.C. 67, 69, 367 S.E.2d\r\n  160, 161 (1988).Â  Spanish Wells confronted the court with a situation similar\r\n  to the one here.Â  The circuit court had dismissed an appeal from a decision of\r\n  the Hilton Head Island Planning Commission for failure to name the development\r\n  permittee but had allowed the appellant fifteen days leave to add the permittee\r\n  as a party.Â  Id. at 67, 367 S.E.2d at 161.Â  Instead, the appellant\r\n  appealed the courtâ€™s ruling that a development permittee is a necessary party. Â Our\r\n  supreme court, addressing only that issue, adopted the majority view that a\r\n  development permittee is a necessary party to an appeal of its permit.Â  Id. at 69, 367 S.E.2d at 161. Â Â \r\nCollege, City, and Board\r\n  (collectively Respondents) maintain the appeal is not timely and must be\r\n  dismissed because College, as a necessary party, was not named in the initial\r\n  appeal or added within the thirty-day appeal period provided by section\r\n  6-29-820. Â Respondents argue that the Rules of Civil Procedure do not govern an\r\n  appeal from a decision of a zoning board. Â Austin v. Board of Appeals,\r\n  362 S.C. 29, 38, 606 S.E. 2d 208, 214 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Indeed, Austin states that the procedures governing appeals from zoning boards are\r\n  prescribed by statute, and the statute makes no provision for â€œamendment of the\r\n  grounds set forth in the petition.â€ Â Id. at 37, 606 S.E.2d at 213.Â  But\r\n    see Botany Bay Marina, Inc. v. Townsend, 296 S.C. 330, 333, 372\r\n  S.E.2d 584, 585 (1988) (wherein our supreme court stated that former section\r\n  4-27-280 governed appeals of a board of adjustment decision to the circuit\r\n  court, but the statute did not â€œaddress the appealability of interlocutory\r\n  decisionsâ€ of the board. Â The court then applied former Rule 72 of the Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure and concluded that the interlocutory order of the board was\r\n  appealable). Â Moreover, in Spanish Wells, the Board of Adjustment moved\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7), SCRCP, arguing the development permittee was a\r\n  necessary party to the appeal under Rule 19, SCRCP. Â 295 S.C. at 68, 367 S.E.2d\r\n  at 161.Â  Additionally, Rule 74, SCRCP, recognizes that statute governs the\r\n  procedure on appeal to the circuit court from the decision of inferior tribunals\r\n  and states further that â€œ[n]otice of appeal to the circuit court must be\r\n  served on all parties within thirty (30) days after receipt of written noticeâ€\r\n  of the decision from which appeal is made.Â  Rule 74, SCRCP (emphasis added). Â Clearly,\r\n  the College was a party to the proceeding before the zoning board because it\r\n  was the applicant for the special exception. Â However, Friends does not contend\r\n  College was served with the appeal documents within thirty days of the mailing\r\n  of the board decision. Â The timeliness of an appeal from the decision of a\r\n  zoning board is jurisdictional. Â Vulcan Materials, 342 S.C. at 489, 536\r\n  S.E.2d at 896. Â We therefore affirm the decision of the circuit court\r\n  dismissing the appeal for Friendsâ€™ failure to file and serve the notice of\r\n  appeal on College within thirty days of receipt of notice thereof.[1]\r\n Having concluded\r\n  Friendsâ€™ appeal is untimely, we vacate the remainder of the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order discussing standing and the merits.[2] Â The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\n KITTREDGE AND\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] We recognize section 6-29-280 provides that the time\r\n  for appeal runs from date of mailing (apparently to the parties). Â We do not\r\n  know how or when Friends received notice of the decision of the Board, but the\r\n  date Friends received notice of the Boardâ€™s decision is not an issue on appeal.\r\n[2]Â  While we agree with the trial court that Friendsâ€™\r\n  appeal was untimely and thus the trial court did not have jurisdiction to\r\n  decide the appeal on the merits, we nevertheless note that were we to decide\r\n  the appeal on the merits we would affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
