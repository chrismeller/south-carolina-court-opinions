Richardson Wieters, of Hilton Head Island; for Appellant.\r\nFrank H. Clabaugh, of Hilton Head Island; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAnderson, J.:Â  Southeastern Site Prep, LLC \r\n  (Southeastern) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order awarding Okatie River, LLC \r\n  (Okatie) $85,000 plus interest.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIncorporated on December 18, 1996, Okatie was formed \r\n  for the purpose of acquiring and developing a 927-acre plot of land known as \r\n  Indigo Plantation in Beaufort County.Â  Richard Covelli (Covelli) was named managing \r\n  member of Okatie, and G. Duane Deline and Sam Mollet were the principal shareholders.Â  \r\n  Okatie did not own Indigo Plantation, but it had an option to purchase the property.Â  \r\n  Okatie obtained the proper zoning to develop the property.Â  However, by January \r\n  1997, a lawsuit was filed by a third party which halted all development.Â  During \r\n  the pendency of the lawsuit, Okatie did not take any steps to develop Indigo \r\n  Plantation.Â  After the resolution of the lawsuit in December 1997, Okatie determined \r\n  that it would not develop Indigo Plantation, and it did not exercise its option \r\n  to purchase.Â  The sole purpose for organizing Okatie no longer existed.Â  Consequentially, \r\n  Okatie closed its office and dismissed Covelli on December 18, 1997.\r\nWhile development was on hold at Indigo \r\n  Plantation, Covelli contacted Thomas Viljac and Steve DeSimone about forming \r\n  another limited liability company for the purpose of performing site development \r\n  construction at various developments.Â  On February 25, 1997, articles of organization \r\n  were filed to create Southeastern.Â  The articles named Covelli as the manager.Â  \r\n  Covelli participated in discussions to develop an operating agreement for Southeastern \r\n  and attempted to negotiate an ownership interest in it.Â  The parties could not \r\n  agree on the operating agreement or on Covelliâ€™s percentage of ownership, and \r\n  they decided that Covelli would not have an active management role.Â  During \r\n  these discussions, Covelli transferred $85,000 of Okatieâ€™s funds to Southeastern \r\n  as â€œstart up funds.â€Â  Covelli wrote Southeastern a check for $70,000 on March \r\n  14, 1997 and another check for $15,000 on August 26, 1997.Â  Covelli gave Southeastern \r\n  an additional $15,000 from non-Okatie sources.Â  Southeasternâ€™s 1997 tax returns \r\n  referred to the total $100,000, including the $85,000 from Okatie, as an obligation \r\n  or loan.\r\nOkatieâ€™s principals, Mollet and Deline, did not \r\n  become aware of the $85,000 transferred to Southeastern until January 1998, \r\n  when they were wrapping up the business of Okatie.Â  Mollet and Deline contacted \r\n  DeSimone for the return of the money, and he initially indicated that he thought \r\n  the money belonged to Covelli.Â  If Covelli did not own the money, DeSimone said \r\n  Southeastern would return it to Okatie.Â  Viljac and DeSimone later asserted \r\n  that the money was given to them to secure a discount on work to be performed \r\n  at Indigo Plantation and refused to return the funds.\r\nWhen Southeastern filed its 1998 tax return, \r\n  it again noted that it had an obligation of $100,000.Â  However, Southeasternâ€™s \r\n  accountant made the following notation regarding the tax return:\r\n\r\nThe $100,000 â€œCovelli loanâ€ is comprised of the following:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        15,000.00&nbsp;\r\n         Advanced \r\n  by Rich Covelli personally\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        85,000.00&nbsp;\r\n         Advanced by a partnership which Rich Covelli was \r\n  formerly a member which was formed for the purpose of developing ______.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\nNor [sic] formal documentation exists for these advances.Â  \r\n  Per Thomas Viljac and Steve Dessimone [sic], these funds were non-refundable \r\n  advances to be used to offset future costs associated with the partnershipâ€™s \r\n  development.Â  Subsequently, the option to develop _____ expired and the partnership \r\n  has been dissolved.Â  Thomas Viljac has been verbally notified by an attorney \r\n  representing the partnership concerning repayment of the $100,000.Â  This is \r\n  as far as it has gone.Â  [Southeasternâ€™s] attorney has represented that there \r\n  is a possible claim to these funds, despite Thomasâ€™s position that they are \r\n  non-refundable.Â  Consequently, we have left the liability on the books as of \r\n  12/31/98.\r\n\r\nIn February 1998, Viljac executed an affidavit \r\n  concerning his transactions with Covelli.Â  In his affidavit, Viljac stated that \r\n  Southeastern contracted successfully with Indian Hills, another property development \r\n  company managed by Covelli, to perform site development.Â  Southeastern performed \r\n  the work and submitted invoices for work performed. \r\n  [1] Â  Viljac contended that Covelli gave him funds from Okatie to cover \r\n  start-up costs, and their understanding was that Okatie would be paid back â€œsolely \r\n  through a reduced price on any work to be performed at Okatie when it was developed.â€Â  \r\n  Viljac also declared:\r\n\r\nI further understand that our companyâ€™s internal financial \r\n  statements at one point may have reflected the Okatie advances as â€œcapital contributionsâ€ \r\n  by Mr. Covelli.Â  This was a misnomer.Â  In 1997, we changed our accounting software \r\n  to a new package offered by Peachtree Software which we were still learning, \r\n  and the internal financial statements are inaccurate.Â  [Southeastern] currently \r\n  treats the advances as loans from Mr. Covelli on behalf of Okatie.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nOkatie filed a complaint against Southeastern \r\n  in June 1999.Â  Okatie alleged the $85,000 was â€œeither loaned to, and/or advanced \r\n  to Southeastern by Covelli, without the knowledge or consent of Okatieâ€™s shareholders.â€Â  \r\n  The complaint acknowledged that Southeastern variously referred to the money \r\n  as a loan or as an advance payment for work to be done at Indigo Plantation.Â  \r\n  Okatie sought return of the funds and interest.Â  The parties stipulated that \r\n  the sum of $85,000 was in fact a loan.Â  At issue in the instant case \r\n  are the terms, conditions, and obligations of repayment.\r\nAt trial, Okatie called Viljac as an adverse \r\n  witness.Â  He denied that Covelli had any managing authority over Southeastern.Â  \r\n  Viljac maintained that his oral agreement with Covelli was that Okatie would \r\n  advance Southeastern $85,000 in exchange for Southeastern agreeing to perform \r\n  site preparation construction at a reduced cost at the Indigo Plantation development, \r\n  if Okatie decided to give the work to Southeastern.Â  Following Okatieâ€™s decision \r\n  not to develop Indigo Plantation, Viljac believed Southeastern was not obligated \r\n  to return the money, stating:\r\n\r\n  We refuse to refund that money dollar for dollar due to the \r\n  fact that the agreement between us and Mr. Covelli who controlled that property.Â  \r\n  The money was to be repaid for a reduction in construction costs on that project.Â  \r\n  Whether it was to happen tomorrow, a week from tomorrow, 20,000 years from tomorrow, \r\n  that was the agreement with our company and Mr. Covelli.\r\n\r\nViljac admitted that he called the money a â€œloanâ€ \r\n  from Okatie in his previous affidavit.\r\nViljac attested that Southeastern could have avoided \r\n  paying back the money by not bidding competitively on work at Indigo Plantation.Â  \r\n  According to Viljac, the agreement only applied to site preparation work performed \r\n  on the Indigo Plantation property; therefore, Southeastern would not perform \r\n  site preparation work for Okatie on another project at a reduced rate pursuant \r\n  to their agreement.Â  Viljac admitted the agreement with Covelli to perform site \r\n  construction at a reduced rate did not have a time limit for performance and \r\n  did not define how the reduced rate would be determined.\r\nDeline averred that although Covelli had \r\n  authority to enter into a contract for the purchase of the Indigo Plantation \r\n  property and to get zoning changes, he was not authorized by Okatie to begin \r\n  negotiations for site construction.Â  Because Okatie did not own Indigo Plantation \r\n  and the development was on hold pending the outcome of the lawsuit, Deline found \r\n  no need for Okatie to contract with Southeastern for site preparation.Â  After \r\n  reviewing Okatieâ€™s accounts, Deline discovered that Covelli misappropriated \r\n  nearly $800,000 in Okatie funds.Â  Okatie filed a lawsuit against Covelli for \r\n  return of the funds.\r\nSoutheastern called Covelli to testify.Â  \r\n  He avowed there was a specific agreement with Southeastern for Okatie to pay \r\n  $85,000 as an advancement to Southeastern for future site preparation at Indigo \r\n  Plantation at a reduced rate.Â  However, he admitted that Southeastern was not \r\n  really bound by the agreement to perform any actual work.Â  Covelliâ€™s 1999 affidavit \r\n  professed that the $85,000 was â€œnot conditioned upon performance of the horizontal \r\n  construction by [Southeastern], nor was it a loan, nor did [Southeastern] agree \r\n  to repay the money in the event that the work was not performed or not requested.â€\r\nThe circuit court found the testimony presented \r\n  in support of Southeastern was not credible.Â  Referring to the documents submitted \r\n  by Southeastern, including Viljacâ€™s affidavit and the tax returns, the court \r\n  concluded Southeastern treated the $85,000 as a loan.Â  The court treated the \r\n  money as a loan and determined the money was a loan payable on demand as a result \r\n  of there not being a due date.Â  The court further found that even if a contract \r\n  existed with the terms Southeastern proposed, the contract would be unenforceable \r\n  on the basis that it was unconscionable and â€œillusionary.â€Â  The court held that \r\n  Okatie was entitled to a judgment of $85,000 plus prejudgment interest, and \r\n  ruled Southeastern would be unjustly enriched if it did not pay Okatie the judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case concerns an action for money \r\n  had and received.Â  â€œThe action is at law for money had and received but it is \r\n  well-settled that equitable principles govern.â€Â  Town of Bennettsville v. \r\n  Bledsoe, 226 S.C. 214, 218, 84 S.E.2d 554, 556 (1954); accord McDonaldâ€™s \r\n  Corp. v. Moore, 237 F.Supp. 874, 877 (W.D.S.C. 1965).Â  In an action at law, \r\n  tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of review extends only to \r\n  the correction of errors of law.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., \r\n  Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000); Snell v. \r\n  Parlette, 273 S.C. 317, 322, 256 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1979).Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the circuit court err in finding the $85,000 advanced to Southeastern by \r\n  Okatie was a loan payable on demand?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the circuit court err in permitting Okatie to impeach its own witness?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the circuit court err in ruling the agreement was contrary to the evidence \r\n  produced at trial?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  MONEY HAD AND RECEIVED/IMPLIED BY LAW CONTRACT/QUASI-CONTRACT\r\nAn action for money had and \r\n  received exists where a defendant has money belonging to the plaintiff which \r\n  in equity should be repaid to the plaintiff.Â  Jackson v. White, 194 F. \r\n  677 (4th Cir. 1912); 42 C.J.S. Implied Contracts Â§ 11 (1991).Â  \r\n  â€œIn order to recover on a count for money had and received, . . . the plaintiff \r\n  must show he has equity and conscience on his side, and that he could recover \r\n  in a court of equity.â€Â  Marvin v. McRae, 10 S.C.L. (Rice) 171, 176-77 \r\n  (1839); accord Cary v. Curtis, 44 U.S. 236, 247 (1845); see \r\n  also Bledsoe, 226 S.C. at 218, 84 S.E.2d at 556 (in an action for \r\n  money had and received, contractor was not entitled in equity and good conscience \r\n  to retain the overpayment which would result in contractorâ€™s unjust enrichment \r\n  at the cityâ€™s expense).Â  Examples of when an action for money had and received \r\n  will lie are when the plaintiff paid money to the defendant under an unenforceable \r\n  contract or where the defendant received money from the plaintiff for a special \r\n  purpose and the money has not been applied to the purpose, the specific purpose \r\n  has been abandoned, or the specific purpose cannot be carried out.Â  42 C.J.S. \r\n  Implied Contracts Â§Â§ 14 and 19 (1991).Â  Once the requirements of an action \r\n  for money had and received are proven, the equitable principles of unjust enrichment \r\n  and restitution provide a remedy.Â  42 C.J.S. Implied Contracts Â§ 5 (1991).Â  \r\n  An action for money had and received is based upon a quasi-contract or a contract \r\n  implied in law.Â  King County v. Odman, 111 P.2d 228, 229 (Wash. 1941); \r\n  66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied Contracts Â§ 172 (2001).Â  The recent \r\n  development in the law in regard to an action in this nature is academically \r\n  reviewed with certitude in Myrtle Beach Hospital, Inc. v. City of Myrtle \r\n  Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000).Â  Our supreme court, in critiquing \r\n  prior precedent in this area, concluded â€œquantum meruit, quasi-contract, and \r\n  implied by law contract are equivalent terms for an equitable remedy.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 8, 532 S.E.2d at 872.Â  In addition, the court adopted the â€œScudder May \r\n  test as the sole test for a quantum meruit/quasi-contract/implied by law claim.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 9, 532 S.E.2d at 872.Â  This test mandates: (1) a benefit conferred \r\n  by plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; \r\n  and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make \r\n  it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its value.Â  Id. at \r\n  8-9, 532 S.E.2d at 872 (citing Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May, N.V., \r\n  312 S.C. 259, 440 S.E.2d 129 (1994)).Â  \r\nIn theory and actual practice, an action for money \r\n  had and received is subsumed and amalgamated under the theories of quantum meruit/quasi-contract/implied \r\n  by law actions.Â  See id.Â  Whereas the action for money had and \r\n  received is founded upon a quasi-contract or a contract implied in law, we are \r\n  bound by and apply with exactitude Myrtle Beach Hospital, Inc. to the \r\n  case sub judice.\r\nII.Â  SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\r\nSoutheastern argues the court erred in holding \r\n  the verbal agreement was a loan payable on demand because there was no evidence \r\n  to support the courtâ€™s decision.Â  We disagree.\r\nOkatie alleged in its complaint that the \r\n  $85,000 was money advanced, without its knowledge, to Southeastern as a loan \r\n  or as an advance payment for work to be done at Indigo Plantation.Â  The circuit \r\n  court found this was an action for money had and received or money lent.Â  \r\nSoutheasternâ€™s tax documents and financial \r\n  statements showed that it originally treated the $85,000 as a loan from \r\n  Okatie in 1997.Â  On various occasions, DeSimone informed Okatieâ€™s shareholders \r\n  that he would return the money, that he thought the money was from Covelli, \r\n  or that there was an agreement with Covelli which, in sum, did not require Southeastern \r\n  to return the money.Â  After the trial judge, who was able to observe the witnesses, \r\n  found both Viljacâ€™s and Covelliâ€™s testimony not credible with regard to the \r\n  contract, the judge relied upon the tax documents and Viljacâ€™s statement in \r\n  his original affidavit.Â  Southeastern, which failed to perform any work for \r\n  Okatie, should have returned the funds â€œin equity and good conscienceâ€ when \r\n  Okatie disbanded.Â  Applying the Scudder May test to this quasi-contract \r\n  or contract implied by law, we find in favor of Okatie.Â  Okatie conferred a \r\n  benefit upon Southeastern by advancing Southeastern $85,000.Â  Southeastern indubitably \r\n  realized the benefit by accepting and depositing the two checks.Â  Retention \r\n  of the $85,000 by Southeastern is inequitable if Southeastern does not repay \r\n  the amount to Okatie because it never rendered services or money to Okatie.Â  \r\n  Based on our standard of review, we find there was sufficient evidence to support \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Okatie proved their action for money had and \r\n  received.Â  Further, in view of the fact that no time was set for repayment of \r\n  the loan, the circuit court correctly held it was a loan payable on demand.\r\nIII.Â  IMPEACHING A WITNESS\r\n Southeastern argues the court erred in \r\n  allowing Okatie to impeach Viljacâ€™s testimony regarding the terms of the agreement.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nPrior to the adoption of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Evidence, the law provided that a party could not impeach its own witness.Â  \r\n  See State v. Russ, 208 S.C. 449, 452, 3 S.E.2d 385, 386 (1946) \r\n  (â€œGenerally, a party cannot impeach a witness he has introduced, either in a \r\n  criminal case or a civil case.â€).Â  One exception to the rule was where the witnessâ€™ \r\n  testimony took the party by surprise.Â  See Gilfillan v. Gilfillan, \r\n  242 S.C. 258, 261, 130 S.E.2d 578, 580 (1963) (â€œContradictory statements may \r\n  not be used to impeach a partyâ€™s own witness except upon a showing of surprise.â€); \r\n  Hicks v. Coleman, 240 S.C. 227, 230, 125 S.E.2d 473, 474 (1962) (In order \r\n  for a party to impeach his own witness based on surprise, it must appear â€œthat \r\n  the party has been actually surprised by the testimony of such witness, or that \r\n  he has been deceived or entrapped into introducing the witness because of such \r\n  contradictory statements.â€).Â  Further, a party was generally bound by the testimony \r\n  of that witness.Â  See Crider v. Infinger Transp. Co., 248 S.C. \r\n  10, 17, 148 S.E.2d 732, 735 (1966).\r\nEnacted in 1995, Rule 607, SCRE provides: â€œWHO \r\n  MAY IMPEACH.Â  The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including \r\n  the party calling the witness.â€Â  Rule 607, SCRE.Â  Parties may attack the credibility \r\n  of their own witnesses without having to show surprise.Â  Id.\r\nThe Note to the rule edifies in regard to the change \r\n  in courtroom practice.Â  The former law in this state mandated that a party vouch \r\n  for its own witness and could not impeach its witness unless the witness was \r\n  declared hostile upon a showing of actual surprise.\r\nIn contrariety to former law, Rule 607 inculcates \r\n  the Bench and Bar that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, \r\n  including the party calling the witness.Â  Southeastern cites pre-Rules of Evidence \r\n  cases to support its contention that Okatie could not impeach its witness, Viljac, \r\n  and was bound by Viljacâ€™s testimony.Â  Although Okatie presented Viljac as its \r\n  witness, it was certainly able to impeach him.Â  Concomitantly, Okatie had no \r\n  way to establish the necessary facts in the case other than to call the involved \r\n  parties to the stand.Â  Okatieâ€™s examination of Viljac exposed problems with \r\n  his credibility.Â  Using other evidence in the case, such as Viljacâ€™s affidavit \r\n  and the tax returns, Okatie was able to show that Southeastern considered the \r\n  $85,000 a loan.Â  Thus, Okatie was not bound by Viljacâ€™s testimony, and it merely \r\n  sought to show Viljacâ€™s bias through his testimony.Â  Based on Rule 607, SCRE, \r\n  this type of impeachment is proper.\r\nIV.Â  INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT\r\nSoutheastern proclaims that Okatie produced \r\n  no evidence to refute Covelli's and Viljacâ€™s testimony regarding the terms of \r\n  the verbal agreement.Â  Thus, Southeastern maintains the circuit court erred \r\n  in concluding the agreement was different from the evidence produced at trial.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe fact that testimony is not contradicted \r\n  directly does not render it undisputed.â€Â  Black v. Hodge, 306 S.C. 196, \r\n  198, 410 S.E.2d 595, 596 (Ct. App. 1991) accord Terwilliger v. Marion, \r\n  222 S.C. 185, 72 S.E.2d 165 (1952); Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 434, \r\n  532 S.E.2d 612, 615 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The court is not required to accept undisputed \r\n  evidence as establishing the truth where there is reason for disbelief.Â  Johnson \r\n  v. Painter, 279 S.C. 390, 392, 307 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1983).Â  \r\nThis is especially true where the court finds the \r\n  unchallenged testimony not convincing.Â  Credibility determinations regarding \r\n  testimony are a matter for the finder of fact, who has the opportunity to observe \r\n  the witnesses, and those determinations are entitled to great deference on appeal.Â  \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc.

Evans negotiated with Accent to purchase \r\n  a mobile home in the summer of 1997.Â  Accent agreed that if it sold Evans a \r\n  mobile home, it would make specific modifications to the mobile home to accommodate \r\n  her disabled sonâ€™s special needs related to his blindness, cerebal palsy, spastic \r\n  quadripalegia, and mental retardation.Â  It further agreed to deliver and set \r\n  up the mobile home, with the modifications complete, within time constraints \r\n  specified by Evans.\r\nThe contract Evans and Accent entered into for \r\n  the mobile home contained an express warranty against defects in materials and \r\n  workmanship.Â  It also included the following language:\r\n\r\nARBITRATION:Â  All disputes, claims or controversies arising \r\n  from or relating to this Contract or the parties thereto shall be decided by \r\n  binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by [Evans] with [Accentâ€™s] consent.Â  \r\n  This agreement is made pursuant to a action [sic] in interstate commerce and \r\n  shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1. \r\n\r\nAn â€œArbitration Agreementâ€ contemporaneously executed \r\n  with the contract provided more detailed terms governing the arbitration of \r\n  disputes between the parties.\r\nAccent delivered the mobile home \r\n  on September 22, 1997.Â  Following delays related to the set up of the mobile \r\n  home, Evans first moved into the home on October 18, 1997.\r\nIn June 1998, Evans sued \r\n  Accent for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of fitness, \r\n  negligence, and fraud.  [1] Â  \r\n  She alleged Accent failed to provide numerous items specified in their agreement, \r\n  including utility room cabinets, a remote-controlled garage door, and a larger \r\n  bathtub to accommodate her sonâ€™s therapy.Â  She professed numerous defects in \r\n  the mobile home, including leaks, holes in garage sheetrock, cracked kitchen \r\n  tiles, inadequate grouting, a hole in the bedroom wall, and numerous scratches.Â  \r\n  Additionally, she asserted the two halves of the mobile home were not properly \r\n  joined, the ductwork was poorly installed, which resulted in heating problems, \r\n  the refrigerator door was defective, and sand and debris were in her water.\r\nAccent answered in August 1998, generally denying \r\n  her causes of action for breach of implied warranty for fitness, negligence, \r\n  and fraud.Â  It argued it remedied problems for which she claimed a breach of \r\n  express warranty, but contended it had not satisfied her request for a larger \r\n  bathtub due to her alleged failure to cooperate with the selection of an appropriate \r\n  bathtub.Â  It averred it remedied all other defects for which it was responsible, \r\n  and any remaining defects were the responsibility of Fleetwood Homes of Virginia, \r\n  Inc., the mobile homeâ€™s manufacturer.Â  Accentâ€™s answer contained no mention \r\n  of the option of arbitration.\r\nDiscovery began in August 1999, when Accent served \r\n  Evans with a set of interrogatories.Â  Evans answered the interrogatories in \r\n  November 1999.\r\nThe case first appeared on the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  trial roster in December 1999.Â  Accent continued discovery by serving Evans \r\n  with a request to produce documents pursuant to Rule 34 of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\nAccent made a motion to the court seeking to dismiss \r\n  Evansâ€™s action in January 2000.Â  It sought to compel arbitration pursuant to \r\n  their contractâ€™s provisions.\r\nIn February 2000, Evans subpoenaed an Accent employee \r\n  with whom she had dealt when purchasing the mobile home.Â  The subpoena required \r\n  the employee to give his deposition at a specified time and place in March 2000.Â  \r\n  Accent did not seek an order of protection from the court to avoid the deposition \r\n  of its employee.Â  Instead, Accent noticed Evans that it wanted to take her deposition \r\n  on the same date when she planned to take Accentâ€™s employeeâ€™s deposition.Â  Depositions \r\n  of the employee and Evans were taken on March 6, 2000.Â  \r\nEvans served Accent with interrogatories on March \r\n  2, 2000 and supplemental interrogatories the next month.Â  Accent answered \r\n  the interrogatories in June 2000.Â  Evans served Accent with a request for the \r\n  production of documents in April 2000, which Accent answered in June 2000.\r\nOn March 29, 2000, the circuit court conducted \r\n  a hearing on Accentâ€™s dismissal motion.Â  Accent moved to dismiss the case so \r\n  that it could be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration provision in the contract \r\n  and the arbitration agreement contemporaneously signed with the contract.\r\nEvans countered that Accent knew of its right to \r\n  arbitrate when litigation began, but waived the right by taking advantage of \r\n  the judicial system by engaging in discovery.Â  She claimed that Accentâ€™s failure \r\n  to seek arbitration for approximately nineteen months after she initiated her \r\n  action prejudiced her because of the time delay.Â  She argued Accentâ€™s initiation \r\n  and use of discovery, unavailable in arbitration, further prejudiced her.\r\nIn a May 2000 order, the circuit court denied Accentâ€™s \r\n  motion.Â  It found Accent waived its right to arbitrate by failing to \r\n  seek arbitration for nineteen months after the action commenced even though \r\n  it knew of its right to arbitrate.Â  The circuit court found Evans suffered prejudice \r\n  from Accentâ€™s pursuit of discovery to which it would not have been entitled \r\n  under arbitration, causing her to incur â€œsubstantial costs.â€\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in \r\n  finding Accent waived its contractual right to compel arbitration?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe question of the arbitrability of a claim is \r\n  an issue for judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.â€Â  \r\n  Zabinski v.

Communications Workers of America, \r\n  475 U.S. 643, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986)).Â  Whether a party waived \r\n  its right to arbitrate is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review.Â  \r\n  Liberty Builders, Inc. v.

App. 2002).Â  Nevertheless, the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings underlying \r\n  that conclusion will not be overruled if reasonably supported by any evidence.Â  \r\n  Liberty Builders, Inc., 336 S.C. at 664-65, 521 S.E.2d at 753; Stokes, \r\n  351 S.C. at 609-10, 571 S.E.2d at 713.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCONTRACTUAL ARBITRATION/WAIVER\r\nAccent contends the trial \r\n  court erred in finding it waived its contractual right to compel arbitration.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe parties do not challenge \r\n  that their agreement contains provisions mandating arbitration of disputes between \r\n  the parties.Â  Furthermore, Accent does not contest that it knew about its right \r\n  to arbitrate under the agreement throughout the entire course of litigation \r\n  and discovery, but failed to exercise its right until approximately nineteen \r\n  months after Evans commenced litigation.\r\nâ€œArbitration laws are passed \r\n  in order to expedite the settlement of disputes and should not be used as a \r\n  means of furthering and extending delays . . . .â€Â  4 Am. Jur. 2d Alternative \r\n  Dispute Resolution Â§ 131 (1995).Â  â€œA party may waive the right to arbitration \r\n  by being unjustifiably slow in seeking arbitration.â€Â  Id. at Â§ 129.Â  \r\n  Hence, generally the right to enforce an arbitration clause may be waived.Â  \r\n  General Equip. &amp; Supply Co. v. Keller Rigging &amp; Constr., SC, Inc., \r\n  344 S.C. 553, 556, 544 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2001); Hyload, Inc. v.

Destiny, Inc., \r\n  321 S.C. 536, 537, 471 S.E.2d 135, 136 (1995); Towles v. United Healthcare \r\n  Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 34, 524 S.E.2d 839, 842 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nAccent argues that no evidence \r\n  supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that Evans suffered prejudice from its delay \r\n  in seeking arbitration.Â  Accent likens the facts in the present case to those \r\n  in General Equipment &amp; Supply.Â  In General Equipment &amp; Supply, \r\n  this court found no evidence of prejudice from delay in demanding arbitration \r\n  where a party sought arbitration after less than eight months of litigation \r\n  which â€œconsisted of routine administrative matters and limited discovery which \r\n  did not involve the taking of depositions or extensive interrogatoriesâ€ and \r\n  the parties availed themselves of the courtâ€™s services only twice before the \r\n  motion seeking arbitration was filed.Â  Id. at 557, 544 S.E.2d at 645.\r\nWe find the facts in the present \r\n  case more similar to those in Liberty Builders.Â  In Liberty Builders, \r\n  this court found evidence of prejudice where a party sought arbitration after \r\n  engaging in litigation over approximately two and one-half years.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  As in the case sub judice, the party seeking arbitration in Liberty \r\n  Builders obtained information from an opposing party through discovery before \r\n  seeking arbitration.Â  See Liberty Builders, 336 S.C. at 656-66, \r\n  521 S.E.2d at 753.Â  Here, Accent persisted with discovery by deposing Evans \r\n  after making its motion to dismiss.Â  Thus, we find evidence in the record that \r\n  Accent availed itself of discovery tools unavailable in arbitration, thereby \r\n  prejudicing Evans by obtaining information from her it might not have been able \r\n  to otherwise obtain.\r\nMoreover, Accentâ€™s prolongation of discovery \r\n  necessitated Evansâ€™s pursuit of discovery, thereby forcing her to incur costs \r\n  she would not have incurred in arbitration.Â  Thus, we find evidence that Accentâ€™s \r\n  continuation of discovery, rather than seeking arbitration in a timelier manner, \r\n  prejudiced Evans by forcing her to incur discovery costs.\r\nWe further note that, during \r\n  the pendency of a ruling on its motion to dismiss and compel arbitration, Accent \r\n  could have sought the circuit courtâ€™s protection under SCRCP 26(c)(1) from requirements \r\n  that it engage in further litigation.Â  As the party seeking arbitration, Accent \r\n  bore the onus to halt discovery by seeking the courtâ€™s protection.Â  Instead, \r\n  Accent failed to seek court protection and continued to engage in discovery \r\n  to its benefit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find abundant \r\n  evidence in the record to support the circuit courtâ€™s findings that Evans suffered \r\n  prejudice resulting from Accentâ€™s discovery activities and delay in seeking \r\n  arbitration.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Evans also sued Accentâ€™s sales manager, Doug Perkins, and her mobile \r\n    homeâ€™s manufacturer, Fleetwood Homes of Virginia, Inc.

Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Danny Thompson was indicted for first degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct, kidnapping, and carjacking.Â  A jury convicted Thompson of all \r\n  three charges.Â  The trial court sentenced him to concurrent thirty year terms \r\n  of imprisonment for criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping, and a concurrent \r\n  twenty year term of imprisonment for carjacking.Â  Thompson argues the trial \r\n  court erred in admitting improper hearsay testimony and in failing to declare \r\n  a mistrial after evidence of his prior bad acts was improperly introduced.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAt approximately 2:30 a.m. on October 8, 1999, the \r\n  victim parked her Camaro in a lot located on the University of South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  campus.Â  As the victim was exiting her car, a man approached her, pushed her \r\n  back inside the car, and jumped in the backseat.Â  The man grabbed the victim \r\n  by the hair and threatened to kill her if she did not drive him to his destination.\r\nThe victim cooperated \r\n  with the man and drove to a rural area in lower Richland County.Â  The man directed \r\n  the victim to pull her car over on a dirt road and he raped her.Â  After the \r\n  sexual assault, the man asked the victim for money.Â  When the victim indicated \r\n  she did not have any money, the man allowed her to exit the car.Â  The victim, \r\n  wearing only her skirt and a bra, then â€œtook offâ€ running toward some lights \r\n  she saw in the distance.Â  She â€œremembered that there were houses that way.â€Â  \r\n  The victim ran to a house on Lykesland Trail to ask for assistance.Â  The residents \r\n  telephoned 911 and the victim was taken to a hospital.Â  After the victim escaped, \r\n  the man drove off in her Camaro.\r\nThe victim was examined \r\n  at the hospital pursuant to the protocol for sexual assault victims.Â  Her clothing \r\n  was taken for evidence and a pelvic examination was performed.Â  The examination \r\n  revealed vaginal tears and bruising, which are indicative of forcible sexual \r\n  intercourse.Â  A sexual assault nurse examiner collected vaginal swabs from the \r\n  victim.\r\nThe victim described \r\n  her assailant to the police as a black male â€œa little bit shorter thanâ€ six \r\n  feet tall weighing about 160 pounds and wearing dark clothing.Â  She gave a description \r\n  of her car and the license plate number.\r\nOn the morning of the \r\n  assault, a police officer from the University of South Carolina went to the \r\n  parking lot where the victim was abducted and discovered that several cars in \r\n  the lot had been vandalized.Â  The officer noticed a Mitsubishi parked in the \r\n  lot without a student parking decal.Â  He ran a check of the license plate number \r\n  and discovered the Mitsubishi had been reported stolen.Â  Lynette Metze, the \r\n  owner of the Mitsubishi, testified that on October 7, 1999, her friend, Danny \r\n  Thompson, took her car without permission.Â  Metze stated that, after unsuccessfully \r\n  attempting to locate either Thompson or her car, she notified the police that \r\n  Thompson had stolen her car.\r\nActing on the information obtained \r\n  from the campus police officer and Metze, the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  issued a BOLO notice (â€œbe on the look-outâ€) for Thompson.Â  The police provided \r\n  a description of the victimâ€™s Camaro to the local media.Â  The next morning, \r\n  the police received an anonymous tip that the victimâ€™s Camaro was located on \r\n  Old Ferry Road in lower Richland County.Â  Officers went to Old Ferry Road and \r\n  found the victimâ€™s Camaro parked in a driveway of an abandoned farm.Â  A bystander, \r\n  who knew one of the officers, informed the investigators that the man driving \r\n  the Camaro could be found in a home located about 200 yards from where the car \r\n  was parked.Â  The Thompson family lived in the home, which was owned by Thompsonâ€™s \r\n  father.\r\nThe officers went to the home \r\n  and found Thompson.Â  Thompsonâ€™s father consented to a search of the house.Â  \r\n  The officers retrieved a pair of baggy, blue sweat pants that matched the victimâ€™s \r\n  description of her attackerâ€™s clothing.Â  The police drove Thompson to the police \r\n  station.\r\nAt the police station, Thompson \r\n  was read his Miranda rights and questioned by Sgt. Lancy Weeks.Â  Thompson \r\n  signed a statement in which he admitted taking Metzeâ€™s Mistubishi, abducting \r\n  the victim, raping her, and taking her car.Â  Thompson informed the officer questioning \r\n  him that the blue sweat pants retrieved from his home were the same pants he \r\n  wore when he raped the victim.Â  Additionally, Thompson wrote a letter to the \r\n  victim apologizing for his actions.\r\nThompsonâ€™s palm print was recovered \r\n  from the exterior of Metzeâ€™s Mitsubishi, but none of the prints found in the \r\n  victimâ€™s Camaro belonged to Thompson.Â  The police found Metzeâ€™s car keys inside \r\n  the victimâ€™s car.Â  The victimâ€™s wallet, which contained the driverâ€™s license \r\n  of the owner of one of the cars broken into on the campus parking lot, was discovered \r\n  on Air Base Road where Thompson told police he had driven the victimâ€™s car.\r\nThe victim was unable to identify \r\n  Thompson in a photo line-up that was presented to her.Â  However, the victim \r\n  testified that she did not look directly at her attacker during the assault \r\n  because she was afraid he might hurt her if he thought she could recognize him.\r\nAt trial, a forensic expert \r\n  declared that Thompsonâ€™s DNA matched the DNA obtained from the vaginal swabs \r\n  taken from the victim and the semen found on her underwear.Â  The expert further \r\n  opined that only one in thirty-two quadrillion persons have the same genetic \r\n  marker as Thompson.\r\nThe jury found Thompson guilty of first degree criminal sexual conduct, \r\n  kidnapping, and carjacking.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Hearsay/Bystander Statement\r\nThompson contends the trial court erred in admitting the police officersâ€™ \r\n  testimony about the bystander who told them that the person driving the Camaro \r\n  lived in the Thompsonsâ€™ home.Â  Thompson alleges this testimony was inadmissible \r\n  hearsay and, â€œeven if it were not hearsay, it was an improper reference to [Thompsonâ€™s] \r\n  character and its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Deputy Thomas Vail, with the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department, \r\n  testified an anonymous citizen reported that the victimâ€™s Camaro was on Old \r\n  Ferry Road.Â  He further stated that when he and Sergeant Bruce Scott arrived \r\n  at the scene, they found the car.Â  Thereafter, the Solicitor asked Deputy Vail \r\n  if he received any other information while at the scene.Â  Over Thompsonâ€™s hearsay \r\n  objection, Deputy Vail declared:\r\n\r\nWhile we were out with the vehicle, Sergeant Scott and myselfâ€”Sergeant \r\n  Scott saw an individual that he knew from personalâ€”personally.Â  This individual \r\n  who lives out in that area said, as I recall, he said, told Sergeant Scott, \r\n  the guy who was driving that car is over there and he pointed to a house just \r\n  at the intersection of Old Ferry and Congaree Road.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sergeant Scott, the bystander told him that â€œthe person that we \r\n  were looking for that was the [sic] driving the Camaro lived on Congaree Road \r\n  and he actually pointed to the mobile home.â€Â  Scott testified the bystander \r\n  told him that he did not want to be identified.\r\nThompson objected to the testimony of both Vail and Scott regarding \r\n  the bystander.Â  He claimed the testimony was hearsay.Â  Thompson maintained he \r\n  needed the opportunity to cross-examine the bystander because the bystander \r\n  directly implicated Thompson as the driver of the victimâ€™s car.Â  The trial court \r\n  overruled Thompsonâ€™s objection, concluding that the officersâ€™ testimony regarding \r\n  the bystander was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but \r\n  rather to explain the officersâ€™ reasoning for going to the Thompson home.\r\nA leading case in South Carolina in regard to evidence offered for \r\n  the purpose of explaining why a government investigation was undertaken is State \r\n  v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888 (1994).Â  Brown edifies:\r\n\r\nBrown argues the trial judge erred in failing \r\n  to direct a mistrial after two police officersâ€™ statements were admitted.Â  Brown \r\n  claims the officersâ€™ statements about receiving information before establishing \r\n  a surveillance, receiving complaints while in the neighborhood, and being â€œfamiliar \r\n  withâ€ the neighborhood were hearsay.\r\nEvidence is not hearsay unless it is an out of \r\n  court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State \r\n  v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. \r\n  1103, 112 S.Ct. 1193, 117 L.Ed.2d 434 (1992).Â  Additionally, an out of court \r\n  statement is not hearsay if it is offered for the limited purpose of explaining \r\n  why a government investigation was undertaken.Â  United States v. Love, \r\n  767 F.2d 1052 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1081, 106 S.Ct. 848, 849, \r\n  88 L.Ed.2d 890 (1986).Â  Here, these statements were not entered for their truth \r\n  but rather to explain why the officers began their surveillance.Â  These statements \r\n  are not hearsay and, therefore, the trial judge committed no error in allowing \r\n  these statements into evidence.\r\n\r\nBrown, 317 S.C. at 63, 451 S.E.2d at 893-94.Â  Evidence explaining why \r\n  law enforcement is in a particular area has been held to be relevant information \r\n  for the jury to consider.Â  State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  442 (Ct. App. 1995); State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 56, 419 S.E.2d 820 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992).\r\nThe case of Rhodes v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002), \r\n  is instructive.Â  Rhodes involves testimony from the victimâ€™s friend that \r\n  he gave the victim a middle school yearbook with the defendantâ€™s picture in \r\n  it because the friend had heard rumors that the defendant was involved in shooting \r\n  â€œa guy and a girl.â€Â  The Rhodes court determined:\r\n\r\nWe find that the testimony admitted in this case about Thompson \r\n  hearing petitioner was the shooter does not constitute hearsay.Â  The rule against \r\n  hearsay prohibits the admission of an out-of-court statement to prove the truth \r\n  of the matter asserted. E.g., Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 260 (2001).Â  Here, it was repeatedly made clear during trial that \r\n  the information Thompson had heard was â€œfrom the street,â€ i.e., a â€œrumor.â€Â  \r\n  It was not offered to prove that petitioner had committed the crimes, but rather \r\n  to explain Cookâ€™s identification of petitioner in the yearbook.Â  This in turn \r\n  led to petitionerâ€™s apprehension and the subsequent identification of him by \r\n  both victims via the photographic line-up.\r\n\r\nRhodes, 349 S.C. at 31, 561 S.E.2d at 609 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn the instant case, the officersâ€™ testimony regarding statements made by the \r\n  bystander were not entered for their truth but rather to explain and outline \r\n  the officersâ€™ investigation and their reasons for going to the Thompsonsâ€™ home.Â  \r\n  Thus, the evidence was not hearsay and was properly before the trial court.Â  \r\n  See Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 111, 525 S.E.2d 514, 518 (2000) \r\n  (finding statements made regarding unrelated crimes not hearsay where â€œofficers \r\n  were explaining their actions in pursuing the defendants and the statements \r\n  were not offered for their truthâ€); State v. Kirby, 325 S.C. 390, 396, \r\n  481 S.E.2d 150, 153 (Ct. App. 1996) (concluding testimony by police officer \r\n  about dispatcherâ€™s call was not hearsay where offered to explain â€œthe reason \r\n  for the initiation of police surveillance of the vehicle in questionâ€); State \r\n  v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 197, 456 S.E.2d 442, 444 (Ct. App. 1995) (ruling \r\n  testimony that defendant was in a â€œhigh drug traffic areaâ€ was not hearsay because \r\n  it was introduced as â€œbackground informationâ€ aboutÂ  the investigation).Â  Cf. \r\n  German v. State, 325 S.C. 25, 478 S.E.2d 687 (1996) (determining, in \r\n  context of post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, that \r\n  undercover drug agentâ€™s testimony that he had tips that defendant was distributing \r\n  drugs and that he had been given description of defendant that would make him \r\n  easily identifiable was not admissible to explain why police first stopped defendant, \r\n  and testimony was objectionable; noting that, while State v. Brown, supra, \r\n  allowed general statements referring to drug activity in an apartment complex \r\n  in which a defendant lived, agentâ€™s testimony in German specifically \r\n  referred to defendant and his character).\r\nII.Â  Mistrial\r\nThompson argues the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial based \r\n  on Deputy Vailâ€™s testimony concerning warrants against Thompson.Â  Thompson contends \r\n  the reference to the warrants â€œconstituted improper evidence of prior bad acts.â€Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe Solicitor questioned Vail \r\n  regarding what he and Scott were trying to ascertain when they approached the \r\n  Thompsonsâ€™ home.Â  Vail responded: â€œWe were trying to ascertain if the suspect, \r\n  the defendant at the time that we knew had warrants, Mr. Thompson, if he was \r\n  actually at the residence or not.â€\r\nThe decision to grant or deny \r\n  a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Cooper, \r\n  334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999); State v. Simmons, Op. No. 3572 (S.C. \r\n  Ct. App. filed Nov. 25, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 39 at 85); State v. \r\n  Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The courtâ€™s decision \r\n  will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to \r\n  an error of law.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000); \r\n  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); see also State \r\n  v. Arnold, 266 S.C. 153, 157, 221 S.E.2d 867, 868 (1976) (the general rule \r\n  of this State is that â€œthe ordering of, or refusal of a motion for mistrial \r\n  is within the discretion of the trial judge and such discretion will not be \r\n  overturned in the absence of abuse thereof amounting to an error of law.â€).\r\nâ€œThe power of a court to declare \r\n  a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, \r\n  and for very plain and obvious causesâ€ stated into the record by the trial judge.Â  \r\n  State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 28, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977); see also \r\n  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999) (granting of motion \r\n  for mistrial is extreme measure which should be taken only where incident is \r\n  so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way); Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. at 227, 522 S.E.2d at 851 (mistrial should only be granted in cases \r\n  of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain and obvious \r\n  reasons).Â  A mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and \r\n  a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled \r\n  to a mistrial.Â  Harris, 340 S.C. at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 628; see also \r\n  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (mistrial should \r\n  not be granted unless absolutely necessary; to receive mistrial, defendant must \r\n  show error and resulting prejudice).Â  â€œThe less than lucid test is therefore \r\n  declared to be whether the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the \r\n  ends of public justice.â€Â  State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d \r\n  471, 472 (1983).\r\nWe find that Deputy Vailâ€™s single reference to warrants that existed \r\n  against Thompson did not constitute sufficient prejudice to justify a mistrial.Â  \r\n  As an initial matter, there is no indication from Deputy Vailâ€™s testimony that \r\n  the warrants referred to unrelated charges or other bad acts committed by Thompson.Â  \r\n  Prior to the testimony concerning the warrants, the jury heard testimony that \r\n  a BOLO had been issued against Thompson based on the suspicion that he had been \r\n  involved in the attack of the victim.Â  Thus, it would be reasonable to assume \r\n  the jury inferred that the warrants related to the charged offenses.Â  Additionally, \r\n  a vague reference to a defendantâ€™s prior criminal record is not sufficient to \r\n  justify a mistrial where there is no attempt by the State to introduce evidence \r\n  that the accused has been convicted of other crimes.Â  See State v. \r\n  Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (determining law enforcement \r\n  agentâ€™s isolated testimony that he compared defendantâ€™s fingerprints with fingerprint \r\n  card agency had on record was not so prejudicial to defendant as to warrant \r\n  mistrial because it was questionable whether jury drew connection between fingerprint \r\n  card and defendantâ€™s prior criminal activity); State v. George, 323 S.C. \r\n  496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996) (recognizing appellantâ€™s possible drug dealing was \r\n  merely suggested and no testimony was presented concerning such behavior); State \r\n  v. Singleton, 284 S.C. 388, 326 S.E.2d 153 (1985), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) \r\n  (noting that references to defendantâ€™s prior crimes in arresting officerâ€™s testimony \r\n  that he told defendant that he was under arrest for escape and murder and that \r\n  he asked defendant where correctional truck was were extremely vague); State \r\n  v. Robinson, 238 S.C. 140, 119 S.E.2d 671 (1961), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) \r\n  (Court emphasizing that, even if the testimony created the inference in the \r\n  juryâ€™s mind that the accused had committed another crime, the State never attempted \r\n  to prove the accused had been convicted of some other crime).\r\nIII.Â  Harmless Error\r\nFinally, considering the overwhelming evidence of Thompsonâ€™s guilt, any possible \r\n  error that resulted in the introduction of the alleged hearsay evidence and \r\n  the testimony concerning the warrants was harmless.\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular \r\n  case.Â  State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998); State \r\n  v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990).Â  â€œNo definite rule of law \r\n  governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the \r\n  error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985). Â Error is harmless \r\n  when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  Mitchell, \r\n  286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 180 S.E.2d \r\n  888 (1971).Â  Where a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.Â  State \r\n  v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996); State v. King, 349 \r\n  S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nHere, the victimâ€™s car was located near Thompsonâ€™s home.Â  Moreover, \r\n  Thompson confessed to raping and abducting the victim, as well as taking her \r\n  car; he identified the clothes seized from his home as the ones he wore when \r\n  he raped the victim; and he wrote the victim a letter apologizing for his actions.Â  \r\n  Additionally, keys from the car Thompson took from Metze were found inside the \r\n  victimâ€™s car.Â  Furthermore, forensic evidence established that Thompsonâ€™s DNA \r\n  matched the DNA obtained from the vaginal swabs taken from the victim and semen \r\n  found in the victimâ€™s clothing.Â  Thus, there was overwhelming evidence indicating \r\n  Thompsonâ€™s guilt, and any perceived error from the officersâ€™ testimony was harmless.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Thompsonâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3585","title":"State v.

Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Murray Adkins was convicted of the murder of Greg Sims \r\n  and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He appeals \r\n  his convictions asserting the judge erred in the jury instructions and allowing \r\n  testimony about the victimâ€™s participation in high school athletics.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJosh Cramer, Tyrone Anthony, Marcus Hinton, Ryan Sims, and Greg Sims, \r\n  the victim in this case, were involved in a drug transaction that went awry \r\n  and ended in the deaths of three people.Â  Cramer received a telephone call from \r\n  Greg Sims, who told Cramer that he knew some people who wanted to purchase drugs.Â  \r\n  Anthony, Hinton, Greg Sims, and Ryan Sims rode to Cramerâ€™s house.\r\nUpon arriving at Cramerâ€™s house, Greg Sims exited the vehicle and told Cramer \r\n  the occupants of the vehicle wanted to â€œlookâ€ at the drugs.Â  Cramer entered \r\n  the vehicle and sat in the back seat.Â  Greg Sims stayed at Cramerâ€™s house while \r\n  Anthony, Hinton, Cramer, and Ryan Sims drove away.Â  Cramer directed Hinton to \r\n  drive to a location less than one mile from his house so the men could inspect \r\n  the pound of marijuana Cramer had brought with him.\r\nWhen Hinton stopped the car, Anthony asked to see the marijuana.Â Â  \r\n  Cramer gave the marijuana to Anthony, who then transferred it to Ryan Sims.Â  \r\n  Ryan Sims immediately jumped out of the car and ran away with the marijuana.Â  \r\n  Cramer stated that Hinton and Anthony pretended to look for Ryan Sims.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  Hinton drove back to Cramerâ€™s house and picked up Greg Sims.Â  After riding around \r\n  unsuccessfully searching for Ryan Sims, Cramer shot both Anthony and Hinton \r\n  in the head.Â  Greg Sims helped Cramer put the bodies of Anthony and Hinton in \r\n  the trunk of the car Hinton had been driving.\r\nCramer and Greg Sims went to Kimbell Leeâ€™s house to ask for Leeâ€™s \r\n  assistance in disposing the bodies.Â  Cramer stated: â€œI told [Lee] I needed his \r\n  help; that I was in way over my head.â€Â  Lee agreed to help.Â  According to Cramer, \r\n  Lee declared â€œthat he would page Murray [Adkins].â€Â  Cramer testified as to a \r\n  conversation he and Lee had regarding Greg Sims and Cramerâ€™s fear that Sims \r\n  would tell the police about the killings: â€œWell, I did say something to [Lee] \r\n  about what I felt like I had to do. . . . That was to kill Greg [Sims]. . . \r\n  . I told him what I was going to do next.â€\r\nAfter driving Hintonâ€™s car to a secluded area and leaving it, Cramer, along \r\n  with Greg Sims, rode with Lee to an apartment complex where Murray Adkins was \r\n  visiting with Anna Stanley.Â  Lee went to the door of the apartment and asked \r\n  Adkins to step outside.Â  Lee informed Adkins that Cramer â€œhad just killed two \r\n  people.â€Â  Adkins went back inside and told Stanley they had to leave.Â  Cramer, \r\n  Lee, and Greg Sims rode to Leeâ€™s uncleâ€™s home, where they picked up Adkins, \r\n  who had been dropped off at the house by Stanley.\r\nCramer, Greg Sims, Lee, and Adkins collectively decided the car with \r\n  the bodies in it should be burned.Â  Lee drove Cramer and Greg Sims back to the \r\n  car Hinton had been driving and left the two men there.Â  Cramer and Greg Sims \r\n  set the car on fire.Â  Afterward, they started running toward the place where \r\n  they planned to meet Lee and Adkins.Â  Cramer pointed a gun at Greg Simsâ€™s head \r\n  and pulled the trigger.Â  However, the gun did not fire.\r\nCramer and Greg Sims then returned to Leeâ€™s car.Â  Lee drove Cramer home.Â  Cramer \r\n  testified: â€œI got out and went in.Â  And [Adkins] come up to the window.Â  And \r\n  he asked me for my nine millimeter.Â  And I told him there was no more bullets \r\n  in it.Â  Then he asked forâ€”I had a rifle; but I told him that it had not been \r\n  shot. . . . The firing pin had broke, and it had not been fired.â€Â  According \r\n  to Cramer, Adkins told him â€œthat he would just get his own gun.â€Â  Lee corroborated, \r\n  to some extent, Cramerâ€™s account of what occurred when the men arrived at Cramerâ€™s \r\n  house.Â  Lee averred that â€œ[w]hen [Cramer] got out, Murray Adkins got out of \r\n  the car and them two went around the back of [Cramerâ€™s] houseâ€ and the two men \r\n  were â€œalone for some period of time.â€Â  Lee, Adkins, and Greg Sims left Cramerâ€™s \r\n  house.\r\nAdkins instructed Lee to drive to a location where Adkins claimed \r\n  he wanted to â€œget rid ofâ€ Cramerâ€™s gun.Â  Once the men reached this area, they \r\n  exited the car.Â  Lee stated Murray â€œsaid â€˜go look for a place to stash [the \r\n  gun] like a tree trunk or a rock.â€™â€Â  Lee testified:Â  â€œ[A]bout that time I looked \r\n  up, and [Adkins] just raised up and just started shooting; just shot Greg [Sims] \r\n  about six or seven times.â€\r\nDuring the early morning hours, Cramer returned â€œto the original scene of the \r\n  drug transactionâ€ to retrieve his pager which he had dropped.Â  When Cramer checked \r\n  his pager, he noticed that he had a voice mail.Â  Cramer declared: â€œI called \r\n  my pager to get the voice mail. . . . [I]t sounded like [Adkinsâ€™s] voice. . \r\n  . . All it said was â€˜I took care of that.â€™â€\r\nAfter police unraveled the story, Adkins was charged with Greg Simsâ€™s murder \r\n  and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Adkins \r\n  did not testify during the trial.Â  He was convicted of both offenses.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  JURY CHARGE ISSUES\r\nA.Â  Appellate Review of Jury Charges\r\nGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current \r\n  and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, \r\n  565 S.E.2d 298 (2002); State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 \r\n  (2001); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000); Cohens \r\n  v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 509 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 1998); see also \r\n  State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 534 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding \r\n  jury charge is proper if, as a whole, it is free from error and reflects current \r\n  and correct law of South Carolina).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, we \r\n  must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and \r\n  issues presented at trial.Â  Burroughs &amp; Chapin Co. v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No. 3575 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 9, 2002) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 71); see also State v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, \r\n  349 S.E.2d 339 (1986) (when reviewing jury charge for error, Court must consider \r\n  charge as a whole); see also Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000) (when reviewing jury charge for alleged error, appellate \r\n  court must consider charge as a whole in light of evidence and issues presented \r\n  at trial).Â  If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated \r\n  portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Keaton \r\n  ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999); \r\n  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991); State v. Jackson, \r\n  297 S.C. 523, 377 S.E.2d 570 (1989); see also State v. Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997) (jury instructions should be considered as \r\n  a whole, and if as a whole they are free from error, any isolated portions which \r\n  may be misleading do not constitute reversible error); Waldrup v. Metropolitan \r\n  Life Ins. Co., 274 S.C. 344, 263 S.E.2d 652 (1980) (stating appellate court \r\n  must view jury charge as a whole before assigning prejudicial error to a discrete \r\n  portion of the charge); State v. Hicks, 305 S.C. 277, 407 S.E.2d 907 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991) (in reviewing challenged jury charge, judgeâ€™s instructions must \r\n  be considered as a whole; Court of Appeals will not find error based upon isolated \r\n  excerpts which, standing alone, might be misleading).\r\nA jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, \r\n  it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  In re \r\n  McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001); State v. Johnson, \r\n  315 S.C. 485, 445 S.E.2d 637 (1994); State v. Burton, 302 S.C. 494, 397 \r\n  S.E.2d 90 (1990) (charge is sufficient if, when considered as a whole, it covers \r\n  law applicable to case).Â  The substance of the law is what must be charged to \r\n  the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 261, 565 \r\n  S.E.2d at 303; Keaton, 334 S.C. at 496, 514 S.E.2d at 574; State v. \r\n  Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994).\r\nA jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does \r\n  not require reversal.Â  Keaton, 334 S.C. at 497-98, 514 S.E.2d at 575; \r\n  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996); State v. Rabon, \r\n  275 S.C. 459, 272 S.E.2d 634 (1980); see also State v. Hoffman, \r\n  312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994) (as long as the charge is substantially \r\n  correct and covers the law, reversal is not required).Â  To warrant reversal, \r\n  a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous \r\n  and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 721 (2000); State v. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 539 S.E.2d 71 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000); see also Priest v. Scott, 266 S.C. 321, 223 S.E.2d \r\n  36 (1976) (in general, an alleged error in a portion of a charge must be considered \r\n  in light of the whole charge, and must be prejudicial to the appellant to warrant \r\n  a new trial).\r\nB.Â  Jury Charge â€“ \r\n  Exercise of the Right to Remain Silent\r\nAdkins argues he is entitled to a new trial because the judge, in \r\n  charging the jury, used the term â€œfailure to testifyâ€ to refer to Adkinsâ€™s choice \r\n  to exercise his right to remain silent.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the United States and South Carolina Constitutions, a defendant \r\n  has a right to remain silent and to not testify during his trial.Â  See \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12.Â  To make this right meaningful, \r\n  our courts have held that it is impermissible for the State to comment directly \r\n  or indirectly upon a defendantâ€™s failure to testify at trial.Â  See Gill \r\n  v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 552 S.E.2d 26 (2001); Johnson v. State, 325 \r\n  S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997); see also Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. \r\n  610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (holding accused has right to remain \r\n  silent and the exercise of that right cannot be used against him); State \r\n  v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002) (as a rule, solicitor \r\n  cannot comment directly or indirectly upon defendantâ€™s failure to testify at \r\n  trial).Â  â€œHowever, even improper comments on a defendantâ€™s failure to testify \r\n  do not automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.â€Â  \r\n  Gill, 346 S.C. at 221, 552 S.E.2d at 33.Â  â€œThe defendant bears the burden \r\n  of demonstrating that improper comments on his refusal to testify deprived him \r\n  of a fair trial.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œFurthermore, even if the solicitor makes an \r\n  improper comment on the defendantâ€™s failure to testify, a curative instruction \r\n  emphasizing the jury cannot consider [the] defendantâ€™s failure to testify against \r\n  him will cure any potential error.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe judgeâ€™s jury charge regarding the defendantâ€™s failure to testify \r\n  reads:\r\n\r\nI charge you now and emphasize to you that the failure of \r\n  the defendant in the trial of this case to testify in his own behalf is not \r\n  a factor to be considered by you in any way in your deliberations and in your \r\n  consideration on the question of the guilt or the innocence of the defendant.Â  \r\n  I charge you, it must not be considered by you in any manner whatsoever against \r\n  the defendant or mitigate against him in any respect whatsoever.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, a defendant has a constitutional right not to testify, \r\n  and the assertion of such constitutional right cannot and must not be considered \r\n  by you in your deliberations.Â  Under your sworn oath, you are to reach no inference \r\n  and draw no conclusion whatsoever from the fact that the defendant did not testify \r\n  in this case.Â  The failure of the defendant to testify should not even be discussed \r\n  by you in the jury room.Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the burden of proof as I have \r\n  stated to you is upon the State of South Carolina.Â  It is not incumbent upon \r\n  a defendant to prove his innocence, but the burden of proof always remains upon \r\n  the State of South Carolina to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  And failure \r\n  of a defendant to testify is not a factor to be considered by you in determining \r\n  the guilt or the innocence of the defendant.\r\n\r\nWhen defense counsel objected to the charge, the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  Your Honor, [I object to] the courtâ€™s \r\n  construction regarding the failure of the defendant to testify which we had \r\n  requested and we talked about yesterday.Â  In that instruction several times \r\n  as part of that instruction and as part of an instruction that may be a standard \r\n  instruction, we talk about the failure of the defendant to testify.Â  The failure \r\n  of the defendant to testify, . . . that wording in and of itself implies that \r\n  the defendant failed to do something; that he had an obligation he had to meet \r\n  and he failed to do it.Â  And as I said, I understand there may be a standard \r\n  instruction.\r\nThe Court:Â  Well, thatâ€™s what [your co-counsel] asked [m]e \r\n  to charge yesterday, sir.\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  Your Honor---\r\nThe Court:Â  I was going to use the word[s] â€œremain silent;â€ and [your co-counsel] \r\n  asked that we use the word[s] â€œfailure to testifyâ€ which I ordered the charge \r\n  for that.Â  Iâ€™ll note your exception. \r\n\r\nWe agree with Adkins that the trial court erred in using the phrase \r\n  â€œfailure to testifyâ€ in the jury charge.Â  Although the charge instructs the \r\n  jury they cannot consider the defendantâ€™s failure to testify during their deliberations, \r\n  the very use of the phrase â€œfailure to testifyâ€ creates an inference that the \r\n  defendant did not fulfill an obligation or duty.Â  The United States and South \r\n  Carolina Constitutions provide that there is no obligation or duty upon a defendant \r\n  to testify on his behalf during a criminal trial.Â  Moreover, our Supreme Court, \r\n  in Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 552 S.E.2d 26 (2001), found it is impermissible \r\n  for the State to comment directly or indirectly upon a defendantâ€™s failure to \r\n  testify at trial.Â  We disapprove of the use of this language when explaining \r\n  to the jury the impact of a defendant choosing not to testify on his behalf \r\n  during a criminal trial.\r\nHowever, we reject Adkinsâ€™s argument that he is entitled to a new \r\n  trial.Â  First, when viewing the challenged portion of the jury charge as a whole \r\n  with the rest of the judgeâ€™s instruction, we find the trial court adequately \r\n  charged the law regarding the defendantâ€™s right to remain silent and not to \r\n  testify during his criminal trial.\r\nSecond, Adkinsâ€™s attorney was the one who requested the charge using the language \r\n  â€œfailure to testify.â€Â  A party cannot complain of an error which his own conduct \r\n  created.Â  State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984); see \r\n  also State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996) (party \r\n  cannot complain of error which his own conduct has induced).\r\nFor the benefit of the Bench and the Bar, we propose the following jury charge \r\n  be used when instructing a jury in regard to a defendantâ€™s decision not to testify \r\n  during a criminal trial:\r\n\r\nThe defendant in this case has not testified.Â  This is his \r\n  constitutional right, and it is not a circumstance that you can take into your \r\n  consideration, or even allow to enter into your discussion in your jury room.Â  \r\n  Under the Constitution of South Carolina and under the United States Constitution, \r\n  it is his constitutional right not to testify.Â  The burden of proof is upon \r\n  the State of South Carolina to establish his guilt by competent testimony beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.\r\nThe fact that the defendant did not take the witness stand \r\n  and testify in his own behalf does not create any inference against him; the \r\n  jury must not permit that fact to weigh in the slightest degree against this \r\n  defendant, nor should this fact enter into the discussions or deliberations \r\n  of the jury in any manner.\r\n\r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jury Charge â€“Definition of Reasonable \r\n  Doubt â€“\r\nStateâ€™s Burden of Proof\r\nAdkins contends he is entitled to a new trial because the judge erred \r\n  when charging the jury on the definition of reasonable doubt and the Stateâ€™s \r\n  burden of proof.Â  Additionally, Adkins asserts the court erred in failing to \r\n  give a curative instruction.Â  We disagree.\r\nA defendant is not required to present a defense and can instead \r\n  rely entirely on the weakness of the Stateâ€™s case since the State has the burden \r\n  of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  See State v. Posey, \r\n  269 S.C. 500, 238 S.E.2d 176 (1977).\r\nThe judge used the following language when defining reasonable doubt \r\n  and the Stateâ€™s burden of proof:\r\n\r\nIf . . . upon the whole case you have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt or \r\n  the innocence of the defendant, he would be entitled to that reasonable doubt \r\n  and would be entitled to an acquittal and a verdict of not guilty at your hands.Â  \r\n  Likewise, should you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the defendant \r\n  has made out his defense, then he would be entitled to that reasonable doubt \r\n  and would be entitled to an acquittal and a verdict of not guilty.\r\n\r\nClearly, this portion of the jury charge was in error because it \r\n  states that reasonable doubt relates to whether the defendant has proved his \r\n  defense.Â  However, the charge, when considered as a whole, was correct.\r\nThe judge instructed:\r\n\r\nThese pleas of not guilty by [Adkins] places [sic] the burden \r\n  of proof on the State of South Carolina to prove the guilt of the defendant \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt before you, the jury, could convict the defendant \r\n  and find him guilty.\r\nI charge you, the Defendant Mr. Adkins, is presumed in law innocent of the charges \r\n  contained in each of these indictments.Â  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a cardinal \r\n  and fundamental rule of the law of evidence that a defendant, irrespective of \r\n  the enormity of the charges against him[,] will always be presumed innocent \r\n  of the crimes for which he is indicted unless and until the guilt of the defendant \r\n  has been proved by evidence which satisfies the jury of the guilt of the defendant \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n. . . .\r\nI charge you, the presumption of innocence accompanies the defendant from the \r\n  time of his appearance in this courtroom and continues with him throughout every \r\n  stage of this trial and continues with him after you retire to your jury room \r\n  to deliberate your verdict.Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the presumption of innocence \r\n  continues in existence to the benefit of the defendant until and unless you, \r\n  the ladies and gentlemen of the trial jury, reach the conclusion that the State \r\n  of South Carolina has proved the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.Â  The State of South Carolina is not required to prove the guilt of a \r\n  defendant beyond all doubt or beyond every doubt but beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n  every doubt.\r\nMadam forelady and ladies and gentlemen, I charge you a reasonable doubt is \r\n  the kind of doubt which would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.Â  \r\n  I charge you that the defendant is entitled to every reasonable doubt arising \r\n  in the whole case or any defenses asserted by him.Â Â  If, then, upon any issue \r\n  of fact essential to a conviction and a verdict of guilty you have a reasonable \r\n  doubt as to how that issue should be resolved, I charge you it would be your \r\n  duty to resolve that reasonable doubt in favor of the defendant.\r\nA defendant, ladies and gentlemen, is not required to prove his innocence; but \r\n  the State of South Carolina is required in law to prove every essential element \r\n  of the offense charged against the defendant by evidence which satisfies the \r\n  jury of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt before you could \r\n  convict the defendant and find him guilty. . . .\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, you should weigh all of \r\n  the evidence in this case, and after weighing all of the evidence in this case, \r\n  if youâ€™re not convinced of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, \r\n  then it would be your duty to find the defendant not guilty.Â  However, if after \r\n  weighing all of the evidence in this case you are convinced of the guilt of \r\n  the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, then likewise, ladies and gentlemen, \r\n  it would be your duty to convict the defendant and find him guilty.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . Ladies and gentlemen, the burden of proof as I have stated to you is upon \r\n  the State of South Carolina.Â  It is not incumbent upon a defendant to prove \r\n  his innocence, but the burden of proof always remains upon the State of South \r\n  Carolina to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the charge as a whole, the judge adequately \r\n  explained that the State has the burden of proving every element of a charged \r\n  offense and the defendant is not required to prove his innocence.Â  The language \r\n  defining reasonable doubt as â€œthe kind of doubt which would cause a reasonable \r\n  person to hesitate to actâ€ is the exact language expressly approved in State \r\n  v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d 372 (1991).Â  Examining the charge in \r\n  its entirety, we hold the judge adequately explicated the law on reasonable \r\n  doubt and burden of proof.\r\nII.Â  VICTIMâ€™S ACTIVITIES\r\nAdkins asserts he is entitled to a new trial because the Circuit \r\n  Court erred when it overruled his objection to testimony about the victimâ€™s \r\n  participation in high school sports. He maintains this testimony had no relevance \r\n  and was only offered to unduly prejudice the jury.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe following colloquy occurred during the Stateâ€™s direct examination \r\n  of Deborah Sims Swinton, the victimâ€™s mother:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  At that time prior to the night of March the second, \r\n  how many children did you have?\r\nA.Â  Three.\r\nQ.Â  What were their names and ages?\r\nA.Â  Greg 17, Jeremy eight, and Madison six at the time.\r\nQ.Â  Okay.Â  Greg, who of course is the victim in this case, \r\n  was 17 years old?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  Was he still in high school?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  Did he have outside employment other than high school?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  What kind [of] employment did he have?\r\nA.Â  He was a cook at a restaurant.\r\nQ.Â  Did he also participate in high school sports?\r\n  \r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  Judge; Iâ€™m going to object to this testimony.Â  \r\n  I donâ€™t see the relevancy or the probative value of this testimony.\r\nThe Court:Â  All right.Â  Whatâ€™s the testimony offered for, \r\n  Solicitor?\r\n[The State]:Â  Iâ€™m just laying a foundation of who it is \r\n  weâ€™re talking about thatâ€™s been murdered.\r\nThe Court:Â  All right.Â  I overrule the objection.Â  Iâ€™ll \r\n  allow a little bit; but we canâ€™t get too far.\r\n  \r\nQ.Â  Didnâ€™t he participate in high school athletics?\r\nA.Â  Yes, he did.\r\nQ.Â  What sports did he play in?\r\nA.Â  He played football, wrestle [sic], track, and baseball.\r\n\r\nThereafter, during Swintonâ€™s testimony, the State attempted to introduce a \r\n  school photograph of the victim.Â  Adkins objected and the judge sustained the \r\n  objection.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the \r\n  trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of \r\n  discretion.Â  State v.

Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 541 S.E.2d 813 (2001) (trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed on appeal under abuse of discretion \r\n  standard).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s determination of admissibility will not be disturbed \r\n  absent abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to the complaining party.Â  \r\n  State v.

Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 515 S.E.2d 98 \r\n  (1999), in support of his argument.Â  In Langley, the victimâ€™s sister \r\n  described how the victim acquired a family nickname and testified about the \r\n  victimâ€™s family.Â  She stated the victim attended Burke High School and played \r\n  in the band.Â  In addition, the Solicitor introduced a photograph of the victim \r\n  which the court allowed over defense objection.Â  The Supreme Court ruled that \r\n  admitting the photograph and the testimony about the victim and the victimâ€™s \r\n  family was not relevant and should have been excluded.Â  Id.  \r\nThis case differs from Langley.Â  Swinton testified in a very brief manner \r\n  regarding the nature of the victimâ€™s activities.Â  The judge sustained Adkinsâ€™s \r\n  objection to the photograph of the victim.Â  Swinton did not go into detail about \r\n  the victimâ€™s relationship with the family or how he acquired any family nicknames.Â  \r\n  Under these facts, allowing testimony that the victim played sports and attended \r\n  Northwestern High School, without more, does not rise to the level of abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  The judge did not err when he overruled Adkinsâ€™s objection to \r\n  Swintonâ€™s testimony.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Adkinsâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3586","title":"Ippolito v.

Smith-Yancey, both of Charleston; for Appellants.\r\nM. Anderson Griffith, of Aiken; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n HEARN, C.J.:Â  This is \r\n  an action in tort for loss of baggage and jewelry by Joseph and Marie Ippolito \r\n  against Hospitality Management Associates and Holiday Inns, Inc. (collectively \r\n  â€œInnkeeperâ€). The jury awarded the Ippolitos $210,000.Â  After the trial, Innkeeper \r\n  moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and new trial nisi remittitur, \r\n  arguing that its compliance with the South Carolina Innkeeperâ€™s Statute either \r\n  shielded it from liability or limited its liability.Â  Innkeeper also moved for \r\n  a new trial absolute, contending the trial judge erroneously admitted evidence \r\n  of past criminal incidents at the hotel.Â  The trial judge denied all three motions, \r\n  and Innkeeper appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nWhile traveling \r\n  from Florida to Connecticut, Mr. and Mrs. Ipppolito stopped in Walterboro, South \r\n  Carolina and paid for a room at a Holiday Inn.Â  At the hotel, Mr. Ippolito signed \r\n  a registration card on which was written, â€œThe management is not responsible \r\n  for any valuables not secured in safety deposit boxes provided at the front \r\n  office.â€ In addition to the language on the registration card, notice that the \r\n  hotel had safety deposit boxes available for guestsâ€™ valuables was also printed \r\n  on the pouch that enclosed the key-card to the Ippolitosâ€™ room.Â \r\nAfter bringing \r\n  their luggage to the room, the Ippolitos walked to a nearby restaurant, and \r\n  they returned approximately forty minutes later.Â  Upon their return, they noticed \r\n  that pieces of their luggage, which contained jewelry valued at over $500,000 \r\n  and approximately $8,000 in cash, were missing.\r\nThe Ippolitos \r\n  sued Innkeeper, alleging their property loss resulted from â€œ . . . the negligence, \r\n  gross negligence, reckless, willful, wanton and careless action . . .â€ of Innkeeper, \r\n  including â€œ. . . failing to post proper notices as required under South Carolina \r\n  law.â€ In its answer, Innkeeper generally denied the allegations and argued, \r\n  inter alia, that its liability was limited or eliminated because it complied \r\n  with South Carolinaâ€™s â€œInnkeepersâ€™ Statute,â€ which limits an innkeeperâ€™s liability \r\n  for guestsâ€™ loss of property where the Innkeeper provides â€œconspicuous noticeâ€ \r\n  that safety deposit boxes are available for the guestsâ€™ use. \r\nAt trial, Mrs. Ippolito \r\n  testified that, prior to the disappearance of their belongings, she looked around \r\n  the hotel room for notice of the availability of hotel safety deposit boxes \r\n  for her valuables, but saw no such notice.Â  Mr. Ippolito also testified he did \r\n  not see any notice of the availability of safety deposit boxes posted in the \r\n  room; however, he admitted that if such notice was posted, he may have overlooked \r\n  it.Â  Despite not seeing a notice in the room, Mr. Ippolito testified he was \r\n  aware that Innkeeper provided safety deposit boxes, but he chose not to request \r\n  a box from the Innkeeper because â€œ[he] felt that the less anybody knew what \r\n  [he] had[,] the better.â€ [1]  \r\n \r\n\r\nInnkeeper provided \r\n  testimony from several of its former and current employees regarding its security \r\n  procedures and its dedication to adhering to those procedures, particularly \r\n  for providing guests with notice of the availability of safety deposit boxes.Â  \r\n  Officer Arthur McTeer Sadler, who investigated the incident, also testified \r\n  on Innkeeperâ€™s behalf, claiming that although he made no mention of it in his \r\n  incident report, he saw a notice posted on the back of the hotel room door indicating \r\n  Innkeeper had safety deposit boxes available.Â  A security expert also testified, \r\n  saying Innkeeperâ€™s level of security at the time of the incident exceeded the \r\n  industry standard.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination \r\n  of the security expert, the trial judge overruled Innkeeperâ€™s objection and \r\n  allowed opposing counsel to ask whether the expert knew about past security \r\n  problems at Innkeeperâ€™s hotel in which Innkeeperâ€™s employees spied on guests \r\n  through peepholes.Â  The expert replied that he was not aware of those prior \r\n  incidents.Â  \r\nAt the end \r\n  of the trial, Innkeeper moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that (1) \r\n  it complied with the South Carolina â€œInnkeepersâ€™ Statute,â€ and (2) it did not \r\n  fall under an exception to the liability protection afforded by the statute \r\n  because there was no evidence Innkeeper acted willfully or wantonly.Â  The trial \r\n  judge granted Innkeeperâ€™s motion on willfulness, but denied Innkeeperâ€™s motion \r\n  regarding compliance with the statute.\r\nThe jury awarded \r\n  the Ippolitos $350,000 in actual damages.Â  However, the jury found that the \r\n  Ippolitos were forty percent comparatively negligent, and reduced the award \r\n  to $210,000.Â  Innkeeper promptly moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  (JNOV), new trial absolute, and new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial \r\n  judge denied all three motions, and this appeal follows.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the trial judge err in denying the JNOV motion because Innkeeper complied \r\n  with the statute, thus relieving it from liability for property missing from \r\n  the Ippolitosâ€™ hotel room?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the trial judge err in denying Innkeeperâ€™s new trial nisi remittitur \r\n  motion where no evidence of willful conduct existed?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the trial judge err in denying Innkeeperâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute \r\n  where the judge admitted evidence of past criminal incidents at the hotel that \r\n  Innkeeper contends were irrelevant to the Ippolitosâ€™ civil action?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially, we note \r\n  this is a matter of first impression in South Carolina.Â  Â Â  Although our Innkeeperâ€™s \r\n  Statute has been in place for over a century, until now, no appellate court \r\n  in our state has interpreted the statuteâ€™s meaning. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 45-1-40 \r\n  (1976).\r\nThe first portion of the South \r\n  Carolina Innkeeperâ€™s Statute states that Innkeepers who post a conspicuous notice \r\n  in guestsâ€™ rooms requiring guests to lock their doors, leave their keys at the \r\n  office, and deposit money and jewels in the Innkeeperâ€™s safety deposit box are \r\n  not liable for the loss of any baggage, money, or jewels left in the room.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Specifically, the statute states:\r\n\r\nWhenever an innkeeper shall post \r\n  and keep posted in a conspicuous manner in the room occupied by any guest \r\n  a notice requiring such guest to bolt the door of his room, or leaving his room \r\n  to lock the door and leave the keys at the office, and also to deposit such \r\n  money and jewels as are not ordinarily carried upon the person in the office \r\n  safe, and the guest shall neglect to comply with the requirements of such notice, \r\n  the innkeeper shall not be liable for the loss of any baggage of such guest \r\n  which may be lost or stolen from his room or for the loss of any money or jewels \r\n  not deposited in the safe.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\nThe statute further states that \r\n  regardless of this exemption from liability provision, even innkeepers who meet \r\n  the posting requirement will be liable for up to $500 for lost or stolen baggage \r\n  from the room and up to $2,000 for lost or stolen money and jewelry from the \r\n  safe if the innkeeperâ€™s negligence contributed to the guestâ€™s loss.Â  This part \r\n  of the statute reads as follows:\r\n\r\nProvided, however, that notwithstanding \r\n  the provisions of this section, any innkeeper who by his own negligence contributes \r\n  to the loss or damage to baggage or personal property, other than money or jewelry, \r\n  from guest rooms, or to the loss or damage to money or jewelry from his safe, \r\n  may be liable to the guest for the actual value of such baggage or personal \r\n  property or five hundred dollars, whichever is less, or the actual value of \r\n  such money or jewelry or two thousand dollars, whichever is less.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Accordingly, if an \r\n  innkeeper fails to post notice, this section is not applicable, and the innkeeperâ€™s \r\n  liability is not limited.Â  Likewise, even if an innkeeper is negligent, so long \r\n  as the innkeeper properly posts notice, the innkeeper will not be liable for \r\n  any money or jewelry left in the guestâ€™s room.Â  Only when guests abide by the \r\n  properly posted notice and the innkeeperâ€™s negligence contributes to the loss \r\n  of guestâ€™s baggage, jewelry, or money does the innkeeper have this limited liability.\r\nFinally, the \r\n  statute includes the following language providing no protection from liability \r\n  when an Innkeeperâ€™s willful or wanton conduct contributes to the guestâ€™s property \r\n  loss, even where the Innkeeper complies with the statuteâ€™s notice requirements:\r\n\r\nProvided, however, that, notwithstanding \r\n  the provisions of this section, any innkeeper who by his own willfulness contributes \r\n  to the loss or damage to the personal property of a guest shall not have his \r\n  liability limited in any manner by the provisions of this section.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  JNOV Motion\r\nInnkeeper first \r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its JNOV motion because it complied \r\n  with the statuteâ€™s notice requirements, thereby limiting its liability for property \r\n  missing from the Ippolitosâ€™ hotel room.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on \r\n  a JNOV motion, the trial court must view the evidence and inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motion.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, \r\n  336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).Â  The trial court must deny the \r\n  motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is \r\n  in doubt.Â  Id.Â  Here, the Ippolitos testified that neither of them saw \r\n  any conspicuously posted notice in their room indicating that the hotel had \r\n  safety deposit boxes available in which they could store their valuables.Â  Although \r\n  testimony from Officer Sadler, as well as several of Innkeeperâ€™s current and \r\n  former employees, contradicts this evidence, the existence of conflicting evidence \r\n  precludes us from finding as a matter of law that Innkeeper complied with the \r\n  statute.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  New Trial Nisi Remittitur Motion\r\nInnkeeper argues \r\n  the trial court erred in denying its motion for a new trial nisi remittitur, \r\n  arguing the Ippolitos failed to prove their loss resulted from its willful conduct \r\n  and that its liability should accordingly be reduced to conform with the statuteâ€™s \r\n  limits.Â  However, we need not reach this issue because the finder of fact implicitly \r\n  found that Innkeeper failed to comply with the statuteâ€™s notice requirements.Â  \r\n  Thus, Innkeeper cannot avail itself of the statuteâ€™s protection from liability, \r\n  regardless of whether its actions contributed to the Ippolitosâ€™ loss.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  New Trial Absolute \r\n  Motion\r\nFinally, Innkeeper \r\n  argues the circuit court erred in denying its motion for a new trial absolute, \r\n  where the court admitted evidence of past criminal incidents at the hotel that \r\n  Innkeeper contends were irrelevant to the Ippolitosâ€™ civil action.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission \r\n  and rejection of testimony is largely within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion \r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent appellantâ€™s showing that the trial \r\n  court abused its discretion or its decision was controlled by an error of law.Â  \r\n  Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 634, 500 S.E.2d \r\n  145, 154 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Here, Innkeeper presented evidence concerning the \r\n  quality of its security practices to refute allegations of negligence.Â  Significantly, \r\n  its security expert testified that he found the level of security at the hotel \r\n  to be â€œextremely good.â€Â  On cross-examination, the Ippolitos sought to question \r\n  Booth, the security expert, about his knowledge of peephole incidents at the \r\n  hotel, arguing the past incidents were relevant to the soundness of Innkeeperâ€™s \r\n  security standards and practices. The trial court allowed the testimony. The \r\n  Ippolitos asked Booth two questions regarding whether he learned about the peephole \r\n  incidents during his investigation of the incident.Â  Booth answered that he \r\n  did not.Â  \r\nBecause we find the Innkeeper \r\n  offered evidence concerning the quality of its security, we cannot say as a \r\n  matter of law that the trial court erred in admitting evidence contradicting \r\n  this testimony.Â  We find no evidence in the record indicating that Innkeeper \r\n  suffered any prejudice from the Ippolitosâ€™ two questions concerning Boothâ€™s \r\n  knowledge of the peephole incidents or his negative responses.Â  See Recco \r\n  Tape &amp; Label Co. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840 \r\n  (1994) (stating that to warrant reversal based on admission of evidence, an \r\n  appellant â€œmust show both the error of the ruling of law and resulting prejudice.â€)Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in denying Innkeeperâ€™s motion \r\n  for a new trial absolute.Â  See Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, \r\n  254-55, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990) (stating that an appellate court will uphold \r\n  a trial judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial unless it is â€œwholly unsupported \r\n  by the evidence, or the conclusion reached was controlled by an error of lawâ€).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and ANDERSON, JJ. \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In arguing its post trial motions, Innkeeper urged the court to consider \r\n    Mr. Ippolitoâ€™s actual knowledge of the availability of safety deposit boxes.Â  \r\n    However, to fall within the protections of the Innkeeperâ€™s Statute, the notice \r\n    innkeepers post must inform guests that they are required to place \r\n    their jewels and money in the innkeeperâ€™s safe. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 45-1-40 (1976).Â Â  \r\n    Here, Mr. Ippolito only admitted to knowing that Innkeeper had a safe available; \r\n    he did not admit to knowing he was required to place his money and jewelry \r\n    in that safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3587","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Tracey C. Green, all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  James Vang was convicted of \r\n  murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and armed robbery.Â  He appeals arguing \r\n  he is entitled to a new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 23, 1997, James Vang, Curtis Kesl, Kai \r\n  Yang, and Ae Khingratsaiphon drove from Charlotte, North Carolina to Aiken, \r\n  South Carolina to rob the Southside Pawn Shop.Â  The original plan was for Yang \r\n  to handcuff Carlton Ennis, the owner of the store, and rob him at gunpoint.Â  \r\n  However, once the men were in the store, Yang did not follow through on the \r\n  plan and exited the store.Â  The men left the scene and decided to drive around.Â  \r\n  While driving, Ae stated he would go in the store and kill Ennis.\r\nThe men then returned to the store and Ae reentered \r\n  the pawnshop armed with a gun.Â  The other three remained in the car.Â  Vang told \r\n  Yang to go get Ae, and when the two did not exit, Vang entered the store as \r\n  well.Â  Vang saw Yang standing by the video poker machines and joined him.Â  Ennis \r\n  approached them and told them they were too young to play the machines.Â  While \r\n  Ennis addressed the men, Ae approached him from behind and shot him in the back \r\n  of the head.Â  Ae threw a bag to Vang and told him to take the guns from the \r\n  store.Â  Vang collected the guns and the men left the shop and returned to Charlotte. \r\n  Â They were arrested the next day.Â  \r\nVang was charged with murder, conspiracy to commit \r\n  armed robbery, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm or a knife during \r\n  the commission, or attempted commission, of a violent crime.Â  Vang was tried \r\n  and convicted on the murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery \r\n  charges; however, the trial judge directed a verdict on the possession of a \r\n  firearm charge.Â  Vang argues he is entitled to a new trial based on any one \r\n  of the following grounds:Â  (1) a Stateâ€™s witness made a prejudicial statement \r\n  in the juryâ€™s presence; (2) the trial court failed to individually question \r\n  each juror following the receipt of an allegedly prejudicial note from the foreperson; \r\n  (3) the trial court incorrectly charged the jury on the law of withdrawal from \r\n  a conspiracy; (4) the trial court erred in admitting a prejudicial and inflammatory \r\n  photograph; and (5) the trial court failed to conduct an individual voir dire \r\n  of the members of the jury.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Prejudicial comment made by Stateâ€™s witness\r\nDuring the Stateâ€™s questioning of Lieutenant Robert \r\n  Anderson, the solicitor asked whether Anderson took a statement from Vang.Â  \r\n  While describing the circumstances of taking Vangâ€™s statement, Anderson said, \r\n  â€œMs. Poteat, [Vangâ€™s] attorney, accompanied me to Columbia where [Vang] was \r\n  being held in the Department of Juvenile Justice.â€Â  Vangâ€™s counsel objected \r\n  to this comment on the basis that it showed Vang was incarcerated and created \r\n  an unduly prejudicial inference to the jury that Vang is â€œa criminal.â€Â  The \r\n  trial judge overruled the objection, but cautioned the solicitor to not place \r\n  any undue focus on the fact that Vang was at the Department of Juvenile Justice \r\n  (D.J.J.) when the statement was given.\r\nVang argues the trial judge erred by not sustaining \r\n  the objection and issuing a curative instruction.Â  Vang asserts he is entitled \r\n  to a new trial because the jury was improperly influenced by Andersonâ€™s remark.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe admission or rejection of testimony is within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a \r\n  showing of abuse of discretion, legal error, and prejudice to the appellant.Â  \r\n  South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, \r\n  524, 548 S.E.2d 880, 886 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  A jury must consider the totality \r\n  of the circumstances under which a statement was given to determine whether \r\n  it was voluntarily made.Â  See State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, \r\n  52, 406 S.E.2d 315, 319 (1991) (â€œ[T]he jury should be instructed that they must \r\n  find beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was freely and voluntarily given \r\n  under the totality of the circumstances before the statement may be considered.â€)Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion because the jury must \r\n  consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding Vangâ€™s statement â€“ including \r\n  the setting in which it was made â€“ to assess its credibility and whether it \r\n  was voluntarily made.Â  Id.\r\nNor do we find that Vang was unfairly prejudiced \r\n  by Andersonâ€™s statement.Â  This evidence was cumulative to other testimony that \r\n  was admitted.Â  Prior to this trial, Vang testified as a witness during Aeâ€™s \r\n  criminal trial.Â  Vangâ€™s former testimony, which was read into evidence during \r\n  his trial without objection, indicated he was held in custody at D.J.J.Â  Because \r\n  this testimony is cumulative to Andersonâ€™s statement, we find any error harmless.Â  \r\n  See State v. Griffin, 339 S.C. 74, 77-78, 528 S.E.2d 668, 670 \r\n  (2000) (â€œThere is no reversible error in the admission of evidence that is cumulative \r\n  to other evidence properly admitted.â€).\r\nII.Â  Jury deliberations\r\nDuring Vangâ€™s trial, the judge received a note \r\n  from the foreperson of the jury asking, â€œAre our addresses confidential?Â  Do \r\n  the families have access to our addresses?â€Â  The judge immediately stopped the \r\n  proceedings and questioned the foreperson in chambers.Â  This discussion was \r\n  made part of the record.Â  The discussion revealed members of the jury were concerned \r\n  about being followed upon leaving the courthouse.Â  The foreperson also indicated \r\n  some members had expressed their discomfort with having to enter the court by \r\n  walking by â€œthe Oriental [sic] familyâ€ because the family looked at them as \r\n  they walked by.Â Â  Significantly, the judge specifically inquired as to whether \r\n  the comments arose as a result of the members discussing the evidence in the \r\n  case, and the foreperson twice indicated that it did not.\r\nVang, who is Asian, contends that the questioning between \r\n  the judge and the foreperson revealed a potential jury bias against Asians and \r\n  the judge should have individually questioned the jurors to determine if any \r\n  bias existed. Vang also contends the judge should have questioned each juror \r\n  individually to determine if the jury was participating in premature deliberations.Â  \r\n  Vang argues that the judgeâ€™s failure to individually question the jurors after \r\n  receiving the note is error and entitles him to a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis issue is not preserved.Â  When the trial judge \r\n  reentered the courtroom he stated,Â  â€œI have shared with the attorneys the impressions \r\n  I have of the in-camera matter.Â  I have stated that I would permit them \r\n  to have the transcription read back.Â  Both have indicated to me that they are \r\n  satisfied with what I communicated to them and they do not desire any further \r\n  inquiry related to [the in-camera matter].â€Â  Vangâ€™s counsel failed to \r\n  object to this ruling and counsel did not request individual questioning of \r\n  the jurors at this time.Â  Thus the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See \r\n  State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 312, 509 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1999) (to preserve \r\n  an issue of juror misconduct for appellate review a party must object at the \r\n  first opportunity at trial).\r\nIII.Â  Withdrawal charge\r\nVangâ€™s principal defense during the trial was that \r\n  he withdrew from the plan and Ae acted independently when he shot Ennis.Â  The \r\n  trial judge charged the jury on the law of withdrawal, and when doing so, added \r\n  language which had not previously been charged in South Carolina.Â  The trial \r\n  judge added the statement, â€œA person who continues in the common design cannot \r\n  claim withdrawal.â€Â  Vang argues this statement is an inaccurate statement of \r\n  law that misinformed the jury and resulted in prejudice to him.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ A trial judge is required to charge the correct \r\n  and current law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 246, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 15, 18 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œJury instructions should be considered \r\n  as a whole and if as a whole they are free from error, any isolated portions \r\n  which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  246-247, 534 S.E.2d at 18.Â  The law of withdrawal is set forth in State v. \r\n  Woods, 189 S.C. 281, 288, 1 S.E.2d 190, 193-94 (1939), which states that \r\n  one who has entered a common design to commit a crime escapes responsibility \r\n  for the acts of his associates â€œ . . . if, before the [crime] is committed, \r\n  he withdraws entirely from the undertaking, and the fact of his withdrawal is \r\n  communicated to his associates, under such circumstances as would permit them \r\n  to take the same action.â€\r\nViewed in its entirety, we believe the trial court \r\n  properly charged the jury on the law of withdrawal.Â  The judge stated,Â  \r\n\r\nIf a person completely withdraws from the common design or \r\n  plan and communicates his withdrawal to his associates under circumstances that \r\n  permit the associates to withdraw, then the person escapes criminal responsibility \r\n  for the acts of the associates.\r\nHowever, if the withdrawal was not communicated to a particular \r\n  associate or if that associate did not have an opportunity to withdraw after \r\n  the communication, then the person remains responsible for the actions of that \r\n  associate that were the natural and probable consequences of the common design.\r\nNow the law requires that a person involved in a common design \r\n  must withdraw entirely and completely from it and must communicate that withdrawal \r\n  to his associates.Â  A person who continues in the common design cannot claim \r\n  withdrawal.Â  Itâ€™s the burden of the State to prove that the defendant had \r\n  not withdrawn from an unlawful common design or plan at the relevant time.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Â \r\nThe trial judge justified charging \r\n  the additional language stating that without the language, the charge would \r\n  be misleading to the jury under the particular facts of this case.Â  The judge \r\n  indicated that without this language, the charge might be interpreted as relieving \r\n  oneâ€™s criminal liability upon communicating his withdrawal from the common plan, \r\n  even if he subsequently reentered the plan.Â  \r\nHere the jury could have believed Vang initially withdrew \r\n  from the plan but subsequently resumed the plan when he went back into the store \r\n  with Ae and Yang.Â  We agree with the trial judge that the additional language \r\n  was necessary under these circumstances to avoid misleading the jury about whether \r\n  Vang entirely withdrew from the plan.Â  The Woods charge requires a person \r\n  to withdraw entirely and unequivocally from the plan throughout the commission \r\n  of the entire plan and to communicate his withdrawal to all of the associates \r\n  involved in the plan.Â  Woods, 189 S.C. at 288, 1 S.E.2d at 193-94.Â  The \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s additional sentence does not state the law any differently.Â  The \r\n  substance of the law is what must be communicated to the jury, not any particular \r\n  words.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000).Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find no error in the charge.\r\nVang further argues the jury charge shifted the burden \r\n  to Vang to prove he withdrew and did not continue in the execution of the plan.Â  \r\n  The final sentence of the judgeâ€™s charge clearly communicates that the State \r\n  bears the burden to show that Vang had continued in the execution of the plan.Â  \r\n  The State presented evidence upon which the jury could infer Vang remained involved \r\n  in the plan by stealing the guns from the store after Ennis was shot.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  there was no error in the charge.\r\nIV.Â  Admissibility of the Photograph\r\nVang next argues the trial judge erred by allowing \r\n  the admission of a photograph depicting the shell casing of the fatal shot close \r\n  to Ennisâ€™s head.Â  Vang argues the photograph was cumulative to other photographs \r\n  admitted into evidence, did not corroborate the testimony of any witness, and \r\n  was introduced solely to arouse the passion and prejudices of the jury.Â  We \r\n  find no error. \r\nâ€œThe relevance, materiality and admissibility of \r\n  photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a \r\n  ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.â€ State \r\n  v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1999). â€œThe trial \r\n  judge must balance the prejudicial effect of graphic photographs against their \r\n  probative value.Â  To constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must create \r\n  a â€˜tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not \r\n  necessarily an emotional one.â€™â€Â  Hughey, 339 S.C. at 460, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  at 732.Â Â  A test to determine whether the trial judge abused his discretion \r\n  is whether the photographic evidence serves to corroborate the testimony of \r\n  witnesses offered at trial.Â  â€œIf the photograph serves to corroborate testimony, \r\n  it is not an abuse of discretion to admit it.â€Â  Rosemond, at 597, 518 \r\n  S.E.2d at 590.\r\nPursuant to a motion in limine, the trial judge \r\n  initially excluded the photograph because it was cumulative to another photograph \r\n  that showed the shell casing. Â However, the trial judge acknowledged \r\n  the ruling was only preliminary.Â  At trial, the State sought to introduce the \r\n  photograph to allow a firearms expert to opine the general type of the gun used \r\n  from the location of the shell casing in relationship to the body.Â  The State \r\n  argued the photograph in question better depicted the placement of the shell \r\n  casing as compared to the other photograph admitted by the court.Â  The pathologist \r\n  testified the position of the body and of the shell casing in relation to the \r\n  body corroborated her finding that the gunshot was a close contact wound.Â  \r\n  \r\nWe have reviewed the photograph and find no abuse of \r\n  discretion in its admission into evidence.Â  The trial judge initially denied \r\n  its admissibility but reevaluated the photograph in the context of the testimony \r\n  of the witnesses and found the photograph served to corroborate the testimony \r\n  offered by the firearms expert and the pathologist.Â  Because the photograph \r\n  corroborated this testimony, it was not an abuse of discretion to admit it.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nV. Individual voir dire of the jurors\r\nVang argues the trial judge erred by failing to individually \r\n  question each juror on matters of racial prejudice and bias, and by failing \r\n  to ask nineteen voir dire questions requested by Vang.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring voir dire, the trial judge informed the jurors \r\n  that they could come forward and speak personally to him when answering any \r\n  of the voir dire questions if discussing the matter openly would cause them \r\n  embarrassment.Â  Subsequently, the trial judge asked the jury venire, â€œLadies \r\n  and gentlemen, do any of you have any biases or prejudices that would cause \r\n  you to favor or disfavor any person associated with this case in any way, based \r\n  upon that personâ€™s race?Â  If so, please stand.â€Â  No one stood in response.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge is statutorily required to ask \r\n  the jurors whether they are related to either party, have any interest in the \r\n  cause, have expressed or formed an opinion, or know of any bias or prejudice \r\n  to either party.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1020 (Supp. 2001).Â  Specific individual \r\n  questions designed to reveal racial prejudices of the particular juror are required \r\n  only when â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ exist.Â  State v. Cason, 317 S.C. 430, \r\n  432, 454 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1995).Â  A special circumstance exists when race is \r\n  an integral part of the case.Â  Id.Â  However, â€œ[a] special circumstance \r\n  . . . does not exist . . . when the only racial fact in the case is that the \r\n  defendant and the victim are of different races.â€Â  Id. at 432, 454 S.E.2d \r\n  at 889-90.Â  In the absence of special circumstances, the questions asked pursuant \r\n  to the statute during general voir dire are sufficient to determine the existence \r\n  of bias or prejudice.Â  Id. at 432, 454 S.E.2d at 889.Â  The manner and \r\n  scope of any additional voir dire questions are in the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  \r\n  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 16, 482 S.E.2d 760, 765 (1997).Â  â€œ[A]s \r\n  a general rule, the trial court is not required to ask all voir dire questions \r\n  submitted by the attorneys.â€Â  Wall v. Keels, 331 S.C. 310, 318, 501 S.E.2d \r\n  754, 757 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nIn this case, the difference in race between the victim \r\n  and the defendant was the only racial fact before the court; therefore, no special \r\n  circumstances existed requiring individual questioning of the jurors.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge fulfilled his obligation upon asking the statutorily required \r\n  questions, which included the question regarding bias and prejudice. Cason, \r\n  317 S.C. at 432, 454 S.E.2d at 889.Â  \r\nMoreover, upon reviewing Vangâ€™s propounded questions, \r\n  we find the trial judgeâ€™s voir dire encompassed the relevant scope of the propounded \r\n  questions.Â  Therefore, no harm resulted to Vang from the trial judgeâ€™s refusal \r\n  to ask the specific voir dire questions.Â  It was entirely within the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  discretion to decide the manner and scope of the voir dire and we find no abuse \r\n  of that discretion. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no merit to any of the arguments \r\n  raised on appeal.Â  Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Vangâ€™s convictions \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3588","title":"In the Interest of Jeremiah W.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3588","description":"A juvenile appeals his convictions for breach of the peace and threatening a public official.

Richardson, \r\n  Senior Assistant Deputy Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia; \r\n  Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence; for State of South Carolina.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Jeremiah W. appeals his convictions \r\n  for breach of the peace and threatening a public official, arguing the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to grant his motions for directed verdict because (1) \r\n  his arrest for breach of the peace was unlawful, and (2) he was entitled to \r\n  resist the arrest so that his actions and comments following the arrest did \r\n  not constitute a threat against a public official.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 2000, two uniformed police officers employed to \r\n  provide off-duty security services at a Florence County apartment complex noticed \r\n  Jeremiah, a fourteen year-old juvenile, walking toward the front of the complex.Â  \r\n  Officer Mickey Cooke testified that Officer Gloria Howard told him she thought \r\n  Jeremiah had a trespassing warning against him.Â  Officer Cooke then attempted \r\n  to call Jeremiah over to his patrol car.Â  He testified that Jeremiah responded \r\n  by yelling profanity at him while continuing to walk.Â  Cooke then exited his \r\n  patrol car and approached Jeremiah.Â  He stated that upon â€œinterceptingâ€ the \r\n  juvenile, Jeremiah â€œturned around. . . . pulled his pants up.Â  And he went â€˜What?â€™ \r\n  in my face with his arms bowed out,â€ while in the presence of adults and children \r\n  outside the apartment complex.Â  Cooke testified that he took this as an aggressive \r\n  action; however, he acknowledged that Jeremiahâ€™s hands and arms were back, not \r\n  forward.Â  At that point, Officer Cooke placed Jeremiah under arrest for being \r\n  loud, boisterous, and using profanity in public, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-17-530 (1976).Â  \r\nOfficer Cooke then handcuffed Jeremiah and placed \r\n  him in the backseat of his patrol car to transport him to the detention center.Â  \r\n  Cooke, however, did not seatbelt Jeremiah in the car.Â  Cooke testified that \r\n  while en route to the detention center he attempted to question Jeremiah concerning \r\n  his identity and relatives whom he could call regarding Jeremiahâ€™s arrest.Â  \r\n  Jeremiah refused to give him any information, stating, â€œI ainâ€™t got to do what \r\n  you say.â€Â  Cooke then testified that Jeremiah became irate, began yelling profane \r\n  remarks, and attempted to stick his head through the plexi-glass panel separating \r\n  the back and front seats of the patrol car.Â  Officer Cooke believed Jeremiah \r\n  was puckering his lips as if he intended to spit on him.Â  Officer Cooke then \r\n  â€œcap-stunnedâ€ the backseat, spraying Jeremiah with a chemical agent.Â  He closed \r\n  the plexi-glass window and proceeded to the detention center.Â  He stated that \r\n  Jeremiah then began to threaten him, stating he would â€œblow [his] â€˜f---ingâ€™ \r\n  head off.â€Â  This led to the charge of threatening a public official in violation \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1040 (1976).\r\nOfficer Howard testified similarly to Officer Cooke; \r\n  however, she stated that she informed Officer Cooke another security officer \r\n  had stopped Jeremiah the day before and advised her that Jeremiah was going \r\n  to be placed on the â€œbanned and barred list.â€Â  She did not indicate to him, \r\n  as Cooke testified, that Jeremiah was already on a list banning individuals \r\n  form the property.\r\nAt trial, Jeremiahâ€™s attorney made a motion for \r\n  a directed verdict at the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  The family court \r\n  judge denied the motion.Â  Jeremiahâ€™s attorney renewed the motion at the end \r\n  of trial, which was also denied.Â  The family court judge found Jeremiah guilty \r\n  of both charges and committed him to the Department of Juvenile Justice for \r\n  a period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the refusal to grant a directed verdict \r\n  in a criminal case, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State to determine whether there is any direct or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which \r\n  guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. \r\n  346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â  The court is concerned with the existence \r\n  or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 \r\n  S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).Â  Furthermore, the court should not \r\n  refuse to grant the directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises \r\n  a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nJeremiah argues the trial court should have directed a verdict \r\n  of acquittal on the charge of breach of the peace because his conduct did not \r\n  constitute a breach of the peace.Â  We agree.\r\nThe offense of breach of the peace is defined as \r\n  â€œa violation of public order, a disturbance of the public tranquility, by any \r\n  act or conduct inciting to violence, which includes any violation of any law \r\n  enacted to preserve peace and good order.â€Â  State v. Poinsett, 250 S.C. \r\n  293, 297, 157 S.E.2d 570, 571, 572 (1967).Â  However, the crux of the offense, \r\n  and â€œ[w]hether [the] conduct constitutes a breach of the peace depends on the \r\n  time, place, and nearness of other persons.â€Â  State v. Peer, 320 S.C. \r\n  546, 552, 466 S.E.2d 375, 378 (Ct. App. 1996). While it is not necessary that \r\n  the peace actually be broken in order to sustain a conviction for the offense \r\n  of breach of the peace, there must be at least, â€œcommission of an unlawful and \r\n  unjustifiable act, tending with sufficient directness to breach the peace.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nHere, no actual breach of the peace occurred.Â  While the \r\n  State was not required to put up any witnesses who would specifically testify \r\n  that Jeremiahâ€™s actions caused them â€œto become violent or think about becoming \r\n  violentâ€ in order to establish a breach of the peace, there must be some evidence \r\n  that Jeremiahâ€™s actions/speech caused at least a minimal level of â€œnervousness, \r\n  frustration, anxiety,â€ anger, or other evidence that the peacefulness of the \r\n  neighborhood had been breached.Â  Id. at 549, 466 S.E.2d at 377 (stating \r\n  residentsâ€™ nervousness, anxiety and frustration which resulted in numerous calls \r\n  to law enforcement in response to appellantâ€™s â€œbooming music,â€ was ample evidence \r\n  for submission to the jury on breach of peace charge).Â  \r\nHere, the record reveals that the State did offer evidence \r\n  of the effect of Jeremiahâ€™s conduct on the bystanders through the officersâ€™ \r\n  testimony.Â  Officer Cooke testified that when he walked over to Jeremiah there \r\n  were several people outside standing on the sidewalk.Â  He stated Jeremiah â€œwas \r\n  just in front of a bunch of people trying to make a show basically.â€Â  He admitted \r\n  that Jeremiah never addressed the crowd or asked them to do anything.Â  Cooke \r\n  estimated there were ten to fifteen people approximately 30 to 40 feet away.Â  \r\n  Significantly, the bystanders â€œcame out to see what was going on. . . .[w]hen \r\n  I got out of the car and started walking after him.â€Â  The crowd never reacted \r\n  in any way after he arrested Jeremiah.Â  Officer Howard also estimated there \r\n  were approximately ten people outside, comprised of adults and children.Â  She \r\n  testified that the crowd did not become involved in the incident between Jeremiah \r\n  and Officer Cooke or react in any manner and stated â€œthey were just watching.â€ \r\n  (emphasis added)\r\nAt most, the officersâ€™ testimony amounted to evidence of \r\n  their own fear of a potential for a breach of the peace.Â  See Texas \r\n  v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 408-09 (1989) (rejecting stateâ€™s argument that \r\n  it need only prove a potential for breach of the peace to prove a violation, \r\n  and instead requiring â€œcareful consideration of the actual circumstances surrounding \r\n  such expression, asking whether the expression â€˜is directed to inciting or producing \r\n  imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.â€™â€) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  The evidence, however, reveals that this fear was unwarranted.Â  \r\nNor do we believe that the evidence supports an \r\n  arrest for breach of the peace as a result of Jeremiahâ€™s alleged â€œbowing upâ€ \r\n  at Officer Cooke.Â  â€œThe freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge \r\n  police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics \r\n  by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.â€Â  State v. Perkins, \r\n  306 S.C. 353, 355, 412 S.E.2d 385, 386 (1991) (citing City of Houston v. \r\n  Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 462-63 (1987)).Â  The United States Supreme Court has \r\n  consistently recognized that â€œthe First Amendment protects a significant amount \r\n  of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.â€Â  Hill, \r\n  482 U.S. at 461.Â  â€œThe State may not punish a person for voicing an objection \r\n  to a police officer where no fighting words are used.â€Â  State v. Pittman, \r\n  342 S.C. 545, 548, 537 S.E.2d 563, 565 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  Fighting words are words which â€œby their very utterance inflict injury or tend \r\n  to incite an immediate breach of the peace.â€Â  Perkins, 306 S.C. at 354, \r\n  412 S.E.2d at 386 (citations omitted).Â  â€œAs further noted by the Supreme Court, \r\n  the â€˜fighting wordsâ€™ exception may require narrow application in cases involving \r\n  words addressed to a police officer â€˜because a properly trained officer may \r\n  reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average \r\n  citizen.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nOfficer Cookeâ€™s testimony explaining the incident \r\n  is revealing.Â  When questioned whether it was Jeremiahâ€™s responsibility to come \r\n  over when he called to him, Cooke responded:Â  â€œ. . . [I]t was the loud and boisterous \r\n  way he said it and using profanity in public, thatâ€™s against the law. \r\n  . . . Thatâ€™s all it takes.â€ (emphasis added). Â He actually informed Jeremiah \r\n  that he was â€œunder arrest for breach of peace [sic] for being loud and boisterous \r\n  and using profanity in public.â€Â  Officer Cooke further testified in support \r\n  of his authority to arrest that Jeremiah bowed up at him when he stopped him.Â  \r\n\r\nJeremiah denied using profanity towards Officer Cooke.Â  \r\n  He testified that when stopped, he turned around to face Cooke, and â€œpulled \r\n  up my pants because I didnâ€™t have on my belt.â€Â  Jeremiah admitted bowing up \r\n  to Cooke in response to an alleged remark made by him; however, he described \r\n  the action as one where he pulled up his pants and asked â€œWhat?â€ while his arms \r\n  were back and his palms were facing open and out.Â  Officer Cooke agreed that \r\n  Jeremiahâ€™s arms were back, not forward.Â  \r\nIt is well settled that the use of profanity alone does \r\n  not constitute fighting words.Â  See Pittman, 342 S.C. at 551, \r\n  537 S.E.2d at 566.Â  Officer Cookeâ€™s own testimony indicates that his decision \r\n  to arrest Jeremiah was based on his language and the fact that he was being \r\n  loud and boisterous.Â  Cooke never stated that Jeremiah made any actual threats \r\n  towards him until he arrested Jeremiah and placed him in his patrol car.Â  Therefore, \r\n  from Cookeâ€™s own testimony, it appears that Jeremiahâ€™s arrest was based on nothing \r\n  other than his profane language, which does not fall within the fighting words \r\n  exception to the First Amendment, and his loud and boisterous conduct.Â  In State \r\n  v. Perkins, our supreme court determined that probable cause to arrest an \r\n  individual â€œrequires more than profanity or loud and boisterous behavior directed \r\n  at the officers.â€Â  Pittman, 342 S.C. at 551, 537 S.E.2d at 566 (discussing \r\n  Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991)).Â  Therefore, we find Jeremiah \r\n  was entitled to a directed verdict on the breach of peace charge.Â  \r\nHaving found Jeremiah was unlawfully arrested on the charge \r\n  of breaching the peace, we must next consider whether Jeremiahâ€™s response to \r\n  that unlawful arrest constituted a new and distinct crime, thereby justifying \r\n  his charge for threatening a public official.Â  This court recently considered \r\n  this issue in State v. Burton, 349 S.C. 430, 562 S.E.2d 668 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  In Burton, an officer unlawfully seized Burton in violation of \r\n  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).Â  In response, Burton fought with the \r\n  officer.Â  During the struggle, Burton removed a gun from his coat, pointed it \r\n  at the officer, and pulled the trigger several times.Â  The gun jammed, however, \r\n  and Burton was subdued and arrested.Â  After the arrest, Burton continued to \r\n  struggle and shout obscenities at the officers.Â  He also spit in an officerâ€™s \r\n  direction.Â  Id. at 433-34, 562 S.E.2d at 670. Burton was charged with \r\n  two counts of assaulting an officer while resisting arrest, one count of assault \r\n  with the intent to kill an officer, and one count of assault with a deadly weapon \r\n  with intent to kill an officer. Id.Â  \r\nThe State argued that despite the officerâ€™s unlawful seizure, \r\n  Burtonâ€™s assault and attempts to shoot the officer were new and distinct crimes \r\n  justifying his arrest.Â  Id. at 440, 562 S.E.2d at 673.Â  The State cited \r\n  State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 519 S.E.2d 786 (1999), for the proposition \r\n  that despite the strong causal connection in fact between lawless police conduct \r\n  and a defendantâ€™s response, if the defendantâ€™s response is itself a new and \r\n  distinct crime, the police may arrest the defendant for that crime.Â  Id. \r\n  at 194, 519 S.E.2d at 790.Â  This court declined to apply Nelson in \r\n  Burtonâ€™s case and held his behavior resulted from a â€œcontinuous flow of action \r\n  and conduct having a direct nexus to the defective Terry frisk and emanating \r\n  from the initial â€˜police-citizen encounter.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  Likewise, we believe \r\n  the actions that led to Jeremiahâ€™s charge for threatening a public official \r\n  were part of a continuous flow of action and conduct emanating directly from \r\n  his unlawful arrest for breach of the peace.Â  Accordingly, Jeremiahâ€™s convictions \r\n  are\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  Jeremiah W. (the juvenile) appeals his convictions for threatening \r\n  a public official and breach of the peace, arguing the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to grant his motions for directed verdict because (1) his arrest for \r\n  breach of the peace was unlawful and (2) the illegality of his arrest permitted \r\n  him to resist using deadly force, if necessary, so that his actions and comments \r\n  following his arrest did not constitute a threat against a public official.Â  \r\n  I would affirm.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict on Breach of Peace Charge\r\nThe juvenile first argues the trial court should \r\n  have directed a verdict of acquittal on the breach of the peace charge.Â  He \r\n  claims the underlying arrest was unlawful.Â  I disagree.\r\n  â€œBreach of the peace is a common law offense which \r\n  is not susceptible of exact definition.â€ \r\n  [1] Â  Breach of the peace is a generic term â€œembracing a great variety of \r\n  conduct destroying or menacing public order and tranquility.â€ [2] Â  â€œIn general terms a breach of peace is a violation of public \r\n  order, a disturbance of the public tranquility, by any act or conduct inciting \r\n  to violence, which includes any violation of any law enacted to preserve peace \r\n  and good order.â€ [3] Â  For a breach of the peace to \r\n  occur, it is not necessary that the peace actually be broken.Â  No more is required \r\n  than that the act be unjustifiable and have the tendency with sufficient directness \r\n  to break the peace. [4] Â  \r\nHere, an officer attempted to investigate a possible \r\n  trespassing violation based on information supplied by a fellow officer. \r\n  [5] Â  When the officer attempted to communicate with him, the juvenile walked \r\n  away and shouted a profane remark in the presence of private citizens.Â  When \r\n  directly confronted by the officer, the juvenile took an aggressive stance by \r\n  pulling up his pants, bowing out his chest, and getting in the officerâ€™s face.\r\nThe crux of the juvenileâ€™s argument is that he had \r\n  a right to be on the premises and that merely cursing in public and questioning \r\n  a police officerâ€™s conduct was not unlawful.Â  The juvenileâ€™s argument, however, \r\n  ignores the evidence that approximately ten children and adults stood in a nearby \r\n  public area when the juvenile yelled profane remarks at the officer.Â  It also \r\n  ignores the evidence of the juvenileâ€™s hostile and threatening demeanor when \r\n  the officer approached him with information that the juvenile might be trespassing.Â  \r\n  The juvenile, then, did not merely curse the officer. \r\n  [6] Â  He acted belligerently and aggressively toward the officer in a public \r\n  place while others looked on. [7] \r\n  Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would find that the State \r\n  presented sufficient evidence that the juvenile committed a breach of the peace \r\n  warranting the denial of his directed verdict motions.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict on \r\n  the Threatening a Public Official Charge\r\nThe juvenile next argues the trial court \r\n  should have directed a verdict of acquittal on the charge of threatening a public \r\n  official.Â  He contends he was entitled to use profanity and engage in other \r\n  actions while in custody because he was entitled to use deadly force to resist \r\n  an illegal arrest.Â  Since I would have found that the arrest was legal, I need \r\n  not reach this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  State v.

On en banc rehearing, we adhere to \r\nthe original decision of the three-judge panel, republished herein, and reverse \r\nand remand. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn February 1974, the City of Newberry annexed approximately \r\n  21.37 acres near state Highway 219 into its corporate limits. The area had been \r\n  assigned in 1971 to the Newberry Electric Cooperative exclusively by the Public \r\n  Service Commission (PSC) pursuant to the Territorial Assignment Act. Prior to \r\n  1991, however, the Cooperative never provided electric service to any customers \r\n  in the area. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, construction began on a Burger King located in \r\n  the annexed area. During construction, the City provided temporary electric \r\n  service. As the restaurant neared completion, Roger Skeen, a co-owner, requested \r\n  electric service from the Cooperative. Skeen, who previously had operated a \r\n  Burger King within the city limits, knew the City's electric rates were approximately \r\n  40% higher than the Cooperative's.\r\n\r\nIn August 1999, a line supervisor informed Charles Guerry, \r\n  the City's Utilities Director, that the Cooperative was attempting to connect \r\n  service. Guerry visited the construction site and advised the Cooperative to \r\n  stop the connection because the area was inside municipal limits. The Cooperative \r\n  ignored Guerry's instruction and continued to connect service by dropping a \r\n  line from one of its distribution poles that had been on the site for more than \r\n  forty years. \r\n\r\nThe City brought this action in November 1999 seeking an \r\n  order enjoining the Cooperative from furnishing electric power to the Burger \r\n  King. The Cooperative answered and counterclaimed for, inter alia, a judgment \r\n  declaring it legally entitled to provide service. On November 30, 2000, the \r\n  trial court held a hearing. Relying on stipulated facts, \r\n  (1) documentary evidence, and oral testimony, the court denied the \r\n  City's request for an injunction and instead issued a declaratory judgment finding \r\n  the Cooperative had a legal right to supply electric service to the Burger King. \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe material facts of this case, agreed to by written stipulation, \r\n  are undisputed. As a result, this Court will review \"whether the trial court \r\n  properly applied the law to those facts.\" WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, \r\n  342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000); see Duke Power Co. v. Laurens \r\n  Elec. Co-op., Inc., 344 S.C. 101, 543 S.E.2d 560 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). \r\n\r\nThe City argues the trial court erred in finding the Cooperative \r\n  could lawfully provide electric service to Burger King without the City's consent. \r\n  We agree. \r\n\r\nThe Legislature enacted the Rural Electric Cooperative Act \r\n  (RECA) \"for the purpose of supplying electric energy and promoting and extending \r\n  the use thereof in rural areas.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-210 (1990). As creatures \r\n  of statute, rural electric cooperatives \"only have such authority as the [L]egislature \r\n  has given them.\" Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 104, 543 S.E.2d at 562. The \r\n  RECA grants cooperatives the authority to supply electric energy only in rural \r\n  areas, i.e., areas with populations less than 2,500 persons. See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1) (1990); Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Town of \r\n  Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 471 S.E.2d 137 (1996). The City of Newberry, with \r\n  a population over 10,000 residents, is nonrural. \r\n\r\nThe RECA, however, also \"provides two exceptions permitting \r\n  a rural co-op to serve customers within a nonrural area . . . .\" Duke Power, \r\n  344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562; see Carolina Power, 321 S.C. at 542, \r\n  471 S.E.2d at 139 (stating Â§ 33-49-250(1) was amended in 1963 to provide \"two \r\n  exceptions\" to the requirement that cooperatives serve only rural areas). These \r\n  exceptions, the annexation exception and the principal supplier exception, are \r\n  found in the following language from the RECA: \r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he act of incorporating or annexing into a city \r\n    or town an area in which the cooperative is serving shall constitute the consent \r\n    of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to continue \r\n    serving all premises then being served and to serve additional premises within \r\n    such area until such time as the governing body of the city or town shall \r\n    direct otherwise  and such cooperative is empowered to so serve, but \r\n    it shall not extend service to any premises in any other part of such city \r\n    or town unless the cooperative was the principal supplier of electricity \r\n    in such city or town . . . . \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 33-49-250(1) (emphasis added); see Duke Power, 344 S.C. \r\n  at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the exceptions is to \"prevent the ouster \r\n  of co-ops from areas they have historically served due to population growth \r\n  or annexation.\" Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562. The statutory \r\n  language, therefore, \"contemplate[s] [a] co-op's continued service\" in an area \r\n  to which an exception applies. Id. Neither party herein contends the Cooperative \r\n  was the principal supplier of electricity in the annexed area. Accordingly, \r\n  our sole concern is the application of the annexation exception. \r\n\r\nThe trial court found Burger King had the option to choose \r\n  either the City or the Cooperative as its electric service provider. The court \r\n  based the finding on its interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-670 (Supp. \r\n  2001) because, in supplying power to the Burger King, the Cooperative merely \r\n  \"dropped a line\" and did not use the City's \"streets, alleys or other public \r\n  ways.\" (2) Section 58-27-670 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n  The furnishing of electric service in any area which becomes \r\n    a part of any municipality after the effective date of this section, either \r\n    by annexation or incorporation, whether or not the area, or any portion of \r\n    the area has been assigned pursuant to Â§ 58-27-640, is subject to the provisions \r\n    of Â§Â§ 58-27-1360 and 33-49-250, and any provisions of this article. No \r\n    poles, wires, or other facilities of electric suppliers using the streets, \r\n    alleys, or other public ways within the corporate limits of a municipality \r\n    may be constructed by an electric supplier unless the consent of the municipal \r\n    governing body is first obtained. Annexation may not be construed to \r\n    increase, decrease, or affect any other right or responsibility a municipality, \r\n    rural electric cooperative, or electrical utility may have with regard to \r\n    supplying electric service in areas assigned by the Public Service Commission \r\n    in accordance with Chapter 27 of Title 58. \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 58-27-670 (emphasis added). \r\n   (3) \r\n\r\nThe statute, therefore, declares that any electric service \r\n  provider annexed or incorporated into a municipality after June 6, 1984, the \r\n  date of enactment, must obtain the municipality's consent before using the \"streets, \r\n  alleys, or other public ways\" to erect poles, wires or other business facilities. \r\n  In reaching its conclusion, the trial court apparently employed reverse logic \r\n  to find that the statute also inferentially permitted an annexed electric service \r\n  supplier to provide new service without consent if it refrained from using the \r\n  municipality's public property. This was error. \r\n\r\nInitially, we note Â§ 58-27-670 by its own terms is inapplicable \r\n  under the facts of this case because the City annexed the area in question in \r\n  1974, a full ten years prior to the date of enactment. See City of Westminster \r\n  v. Blue Ridge Elec. Coop., 295 S.C. 93, 97, 366 S.E.2d 611, 613 (Ct. App. \r\n  1988) (\"[T]he Legislature intended the amended provisions of Sections 58-27-670 \r\n  and 58-27-1360 to apply to areas annexed or incorporated after the effective \r\n  date of the amendments (i.e. June 6, 1984).\"). Moreover, our supreme court has \r\n  interpreted Â§ 58-27-670 to mean that a rural electric cooperative possessing \r\n  a valid PSC territorial assignment to serve an area subsequently annexed is \r\n  \"permitted to continue service in that area to those premises being \r\n  served as of the date of the annexation or incorporation,\" but \"prohibited, \r\n  without prior consent of the municipality, from extending or expanding \r\n  service in that area by the use of any streets, alleys, public property or public \r\n  ways after the date of annexation or incorporation.\" City of Abbeville v. \r\n  Aiken Elec. Coop., 287 S.C. 361, 370-71, 338 S.E.2d 831, 836 (1985) (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n\r\nFinally, Â§ 58-27-670 expressly states it is subject to the \r\n  terms of Â§ 33-49-250, which clearly limit a cooperative's ability to provide \r\n  service in an annexed or incorporated area without the municipality's express \r\n  consent. The plain language of the annexation exception contained in Â§ 33-49-250(1) \r\n  provides that the act of annexation or incorporation by a municipality constitutes \r\n  its implied consent for a cooperative \"to continue serving all premises then \r\n  being served . . . .\" Thus, if a cooperative is serving existing customers, \r\n  it has a statutory right to continue serving them even after annexation. See \r\n  Â§ 33-49-250(1); Carolina Power, 321 S.C. at 543, 471 S.E.2d at 140 (\"[T]he \r\n  intent of the [L]egislature in adopting the annexation exception was to permit \r\n  co-ops to continue to serve existing customers and not require ouster of a co-op \r\n  due solely to a city's annexation.\"). The Cooperative admits it had no customers \r\n  in the annexed area prior to Burger King; hence, it does not fall within the \r\n  category of cooperatives afforded the City's implied consent. See Â§ 33-49-250(1); \r\n  Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 106, 543 S.E.2d at 563 (noting that where a cooperative \r\n  is not serving any customers at the time of annexation a decision barring it \r\n  from serving the annexed area does not result in an impermissible ouster). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, although the annexation exception also implies \r\n  consent for cooperatives to serve \"additional premises,\" i.e., new customers, \r\n  within an annexed area, the statute expressly limits a cooperative's authority \r\n  to provide new or increased service by allowing it only \"until such time as \r\n  the governing body of the city or town shall direct otherwise . . . .\" Â§ 33-49-250(1). \r\n  As the parties stipulated the City never consented to service by the Cooperative, \r\n  and the record reflects the City in fact \"direct[ed] otherwise\" when Charles \r\n  Guerry informed the Cooperative it needed to stop the installation of new service, \r\n  this aspect of the annexation exception is similarly unavailing to the Cooperative. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold Â§ 58-27-670 was an inappropriate \r\n  basis for the trial court's ruling. The trial court erred in finding the Cooperative \r\n  was authorized to provide electric service to the Burger King in the absence \r\n  of the City's consent. Accordingly, we reverse the court's declaratory judgment \r\n  in the Cooperative's favor, and remand for entry of an order enjoining the Cooperative \r\n  from providing such service. \r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON, GOOLSBY, CONNOR, ANDERSON, \r\n  HUFF, HOWARD and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n1.  The relevant stipulated facts include: \r\n  1) the City annexed the area in 1974, 2) the PSC assigned the area to the Cooperative \r\n  prior to annexation, 3) the City population estimate at the time was 10,542, \r\n  4) the Cooperative served no customers within the area prior to Burger King, \r\n  5) the City never consented to service by the Cooperative, 6) the Cooperative \r\n  moved no poles prior to beginning service, and 7) the Cooperative maintained \r\n  the poles and lines used to provide service both before and after annexation. \r\n\r\n2.  The parties agreed the Cooperative \r\n  did not use the streets, alleys, or public ways of the City in providing electric \r\n  service to Burger King.  \r\n3.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250 (1990) \r\n  enumerates the powers of rural electric cooperatives, while S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  58-27-1360 (Supp. 2001) permits, upon payment of just compensation, the ouster \r\n  of an annexed or incorporated electric supplier whom the municipality determines \r\n  is providing \"inadequate, undependable, or unreasonably discriminatory\" service. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3590","title":"State v.

Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Druanne D. White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Anthony Leroy Mattison appeals his conviction for possession \r\n  of crack cocaine.Â  He argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to \r\n  suppress evidence where (1) his consent was coerced and involuntary; (2) the \r\n  search exceeded the scope of his consent; (3) the search was not based on reasonable \r\n  suspicion; and (4) the search exceeded any scope authorized by Terry v. Ohio. \r\n  [1] Â  We affirm. [2] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 7, 2000, Patrol Officer William Jones, with the City of \r\n  Anderson Police Department, stopped a car traveling in Anderson because the \r\n  car had no rear license plate.Â  There were three people in the car.Â  Mattison \r\n  was seated in the back of the car, while the driver and another passenger were \r\n  seated in the front.\r\nWhen Officer Jones approached the vehicle, he observed the front seat passenger \r\n  â€œconcealing something in his left hand and reaching between his legs.â€Â  A consensual \r\n  search of the front seat passenger revealed he possessed crack cocaine.Â  He \r\n  was subsequently arrested.\r\nOfficer Jones noticed Mattison in the back seat of the car.Â  Jones \r\n  opened his door and asked Mattison, â€œDo you have anything on you?â€Â  Mattison \r\n  replied, â€œNo.â€Â  Jones then asked Mattison, â€œDo you mind if I check?â€Â  \r\n  Mattison responded, â€œGo ahead.â€Â  At Jonesâ€™ request, Mattison exited the vehicle \r\n  unassisted.Â  Jones conducted a pat-down of Mattison.Â  Officer Jones testified:\r\n\r\n  When I got around to the waistband area, [Mattison] kept, \r\n  in a nervous manner, reaching his hands back down, which led [to] more suspicion \r\n  that there might be something down there.Â  He kept putting them down.Â  I told \r\n  him several times, â€˜Keep your hands on the hood or on the trunk.â€™Â  He complied.Â  \r\n  He was very cooperative.\r\n  At that point, I checked the crotch area and I felt a hard \r\n  rock-like substance, which I immediately recognized to be crack cocaine.\r\n\r\nJones asked Mattison, â€œWhat do we have here?â€Â  Mattison replied, â€œOh, thatâ€™s \r\n  my thing.â€Â  As a safety precaution, Jones placed handcuffs on Mattison.\r\nJones unbuttoned the front of Mattisonâ€™s pants and, while wearing \r\n  a glove, retrieved a plastic bag wrapped in yellow tissue paper located near \r\n  Mattisonâ€™s genitalia.Â  The plastic bag contained approximately 6 grams of crack \r\n  cocaine.\r\nAt no time did Mattison verbally express a desire for the pat-down to cease.Â  \r\n  Officer Jones stated that Mattison did not appear to be under the influence \r\n  of drugs or alcohol.Â  Jones declared there was no question in his mind that \r\n  Mattison â€œgave voluntary consentâ€ to the pat-down.Â  Jones asserted he did not \r\n  have his gun drawn and used no coercion to solicit Mattisonâ€™s consent. \r\nWith the assistance of a police dog trained to detect illegal drugs, officers \r\n  found more crack cocaine under the driverâ€™s seat.Â  The driver of the car was \r\n  placed under arrest.\r\nAt the arrest scene, four police officers, including Officer Jones, \r\n  were present.Â  In addition, Staff Chaplain Lloyd Robinson was riding in the \r\n  car with Officer Jones and was at the scene.Â  Finally, Randall Human accompanied \r\n  one of the officers to the scene.Â  There were four police cars at the arrest \r\n  location.\r\nMattison was charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent \r\n  to distribute and possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within \r\n  proximity of a park. \r\nAt trial, Mattison moved to suppress evidence found from his frisk by the police \r\n  officer, claiming his consent was not given voluntarily.Â  In denying Mattisonâ€™s \r\n  suppression motion, the trial court, considering the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  ruled Mattison freely and voluntarily consented to the search because he did \r\n  not think police would search his genital area for drugs.Â  Additionally, the \r\n  court concluded that, after Mattison gave consent, he â€œstood by silently while \r\n  the search occurred[,] without objection.â€Â  At the close of evidence, Mattison \r\n  moved for a directed verdict â€œon the basis that the evidence that has been identified \r\n  as crack cocaine should have been excluded.â€Â  He further requested â€œthat Officer \r\n  Jones and anybody else[â€™]s testimony that [Mattison] consented should be excluded \r\n  under all the argumentsâ€ he made at the previous motion to suppress hearing.Â  \r\n  The court denied the motions.\r\nA jury convicted Mattison of simple possession of crack cocaine but \r\n  found him not guilty of the charge of possession of crack cocaine with intent \r\n  to distribute within proximity of a park.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;\r\n        \r\n       \r\n  Was Mattisonâ€™s consent coerced and involuntary?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;\r\n        \r\n       \r\n  Did the pat-down search of Mattison exceed the scope of his consent?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       III.\r\n        \r\n       \r\n  Was the pat-down search based on reasonable suspicion?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       IV.\r\n        \r\n       \r\n  Did the pat-down search exceed any scope authorized by Terry v. Ohio?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State \r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Missouri, \r\n  Op. No. 3563 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 12, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37 \r\n  at 50).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they \r\n  are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  105 (2000).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its \r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. \r\n  at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); \r\n  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to \r\n  the defendant.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001); State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based \r\n  on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 \r\n  (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits \r\n  unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  The South Carolina \r\n  Constitution provides similar protection against unlawful searches and seizures.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  Evidence obtained in violation of the \r\n  Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in both state and federal court.Â  See \r\n  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); Weeks \r\n  v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914); State \r\n  v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001); State v. Missouri, \r\n  Op. No. 3563 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 12, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37 \r\n  at 50); State v. Austin, 306 S.C. 9, 409 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\nI.Â  Voluntary Nature \r\n  of Consent to Search\r\nMattison contends the consent to search was coerced, rendering it \r\n  involuntary.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhether a consent to search was voluntary or the product of duress or coercion, \r\n  express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality \r\n  of the circumstances.Â  State v. Wallace, 269 S.C. 547, 238 S.E.2d 675 \r\n  (1977); State v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 552 S.E.2d 773 (Ct. App. 2001); \r\n  State v. Dorce, 320 S.C. 480, 465 S.E.2d 772 (Ct. App. 1995); see \r\n  also Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 511 S.E.2d 62 (1999) (existence \r\n  of consent is determined from totality of circumstances).Â  The State bears the \r\n  burden of establishing the voluntariness of the consent.Â  Schneckloth v. \r\n  Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); State \r\n  v. Harris, 277 S.C. 274, 286 S.E.2d 137 (1982); Wallace, 269 S.C. \r\n  at 550, 238 S.E.2d at 676; Brannon, 347 S.C. at 89-90, 552 S.E.2d at \r\n  775; Dorce, 320 S.C. at 482, 465 S.E.2d at 773; see also Palacio, \r\n  333 S.C. at 514, 511 S.E.2d at 66 (on motion to suppress, State has burden of \r\n  proving validity of consent).\r\nThe â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ test applies whether the consent was given \r\n  in a non-custodial or custodial situation.Â  Wallace, 269 S.C. at 550, \r\n  238 S.E.2d at 676; Brannon, 347 S.C. at 90, 552 S.E.2d at 775.Â  In a \r\n  custodial situation, the custodial setting is a factor to be considered in determining \r\n  whether consent was voluntarily given.Â  Wallace, 269 S.C. at 552, 238 \r\n  S.E.2d at 677; Brannon, 347 S.C. at 90, 552 S.E.2d at 775.Â  Custody alone, \r\n  however, is not enough in itself to demonstrate a coerced consent to search.Â  \r\n  Brannon, 347 S.C. at 90, 552 S.E.2d at 775; see also United \r\n  States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976) (finding \r\n  involuntary consent was not shown where defendant was arrested and in custody, \r\n  but consent was given while on a public street and not in confines of a police \r\n  station, he was given his Miranda warnings, and he was advised the results \r\n  of the search of his car could be used against him); Wallace, 269 S.C. \r\n  at 552, 238 S.E.2d at 677 (holding that custody itself is not enough to invalidate \r\n  a consent search).\r\nThe issue of voluntary consent, when contested by contradicting testimony, \r\n  is an issue of credibility to be determined by the trial judge.Â  State v. \r\n  Maybank, Op. No. 3566 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 12, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 37 at 90); Dorce, 320 S.C. at 482, 465 S.E.2d at 773.Â  A trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s conclusions on issues of fact regarding voluntariness will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as to be an abuse of discretion.Â  State \r\n  v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 391 S.E.2d 244 (1990) (dealing with voluntariness \r\n  of a statement); State v. Greene, 330 S.C. 551, 499 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).\r\nThere is no dispute that Mattison consented to Officer Jonesâ€™s request to search \r\n  him without imposing limits on the scope of the search.Â  No evidence indicates \r\n  Mattison gave consent while incompetent.Â  Moreover, the record reveals no overt \r\n  act, threat of force, or other form of coercion.Â  Mattison claims the fact that \r\n  he was â€œsurroundedâ€ by a drug dog and four police officers with squad cars flashing \r\n  blue lights demonstrated a â€œshow of forceâ€ that indicates coercion.Â  This argument \r\n  lacks merit, as their presence was necessary at a crime scene.Â  Thus, we cannot \r\n  say as a matter of law that this activity constituted coercion, because the \r\n  drug dog was instrumental in finding drugs in the car and the multiplicity of \r\n  suspects warranted the plethora of law enforcement officers.\r\nBased on the evidence in the record, we find no abuse of discretion in the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling that Mattisonâ€™s consent was voluntarily given.\r\nII.Â  Exceeding Scope \r\n  of Search\r\nMattison maintains that, if he did voluntarily consent to \r\n  a search, Officer Jones exceeded the permissible scope when he proceeded to \r\n  search Mattisonâ€™s groin area.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder our state constitution, suspects are free to limit the scope of the searches \r\n  to which they consent.Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  837 (2001).Â  â€œWhen relying on the consent of a suspect, a police officerâ€™s search \r\n  must not exceed the scope of the consent granted or the search becomes unreasonable.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 648, 541 S.E.2d at 843.Â  Even in a situation where police have \r\n  received a general and unqualified consent, â€œâ€˜the police do not have carte blanche \r\n  to do whatever they please.â€™â€Â  Id. at 648-49, 541 S.E.2d at 843 (quoting \r\n  3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure Â§ 8.1(c), at 612 (3d ed. 1996).Â  \r\n  The scope of the consent is measured by a test of â€œâ€˜objectiveâ€™ reasonablenessâ€”what \r\n  would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between \r\n  the officer and the suspect?â€Â  Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251, \r\n  111 S.Ct. 1801, 1803-04, 114 L.Ed.2d 297, 302 (1991).\r\nHere, Mattisonâ€™s co-passenger had just been searched and arrested after the \r\n  police found crack cocaine.Â  Immediately thereafter, in response to Officer \r\n  Jonesâ€™s question, â€œDo you have anything on you,â€ Mattison replied, â€œNo.â€Â  Officer \r\n  Jones then asked, â€œDo you mind if I check?â€Â  Mattison responded, â€œGo ahead.â€Â  \r\n  Mattison imposed no limits on the scope of the search he granted in response \r\n  to Officer Jonesâ€™s request to search him.Â  Mattison clearly consented to a search \r\n  of his body for drugs.Â  We conclude a reasonable \r\n  person would have understood that consent to encompass a search of Mattisonâ€™s \r\n  groin area.Â  See United States v. Rodney, 956 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. \r\n  1992) (noting that genital area is a frequent hiding place for drugs).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has described a typical pat-down search as \r\n  including a thorough search of the suspectâ€™s â€œarms and armpits, waistline and \r\n  back, the groin and area about the testicles, and entire surface \r\n  of the legs down to the feet.â€Â  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 17 n.13, 88 \r\n  S.Ct. 1868, 1877 n.13, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 903 n.13 (1968) (emphasis added).Â  A \r\n  suspectâ€™s â€œobjectively reasonableâ€ consent to a body search indicates consent \r\n  to a â€œtraditional frisk search,â€ including a â€œsweeping motionâ€ over the outer \r\n  garments of the crotch area.Â  See United States v. Ashley, 37 \r\n  F.3d 678 (D.C. Cir. 1994).Â  Mattisonâ€™s generalized consent authorized the kind \r\n  of â€œtraditional frisk searchâ€ undertaken here.Â  Furthermore, once Officer Jones \r\n  identified the presence of the crack cocaine, he was allowed to remove it.Â  \r\n  See United States v. Mattarolo, 209 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir. 2000).\r\nIII.Â  Withdrawal \r\n  of Consent\r\nMattison asserts he withdrew consent when he attempted to lower his \r\n  hands as the officer searched his groin area.Â  However, Mattison verbally gave \r\n  unequivocal consent and never stated that he withdrew his consent to the search. \r\n\r\nConduct falling short of â€œan unequivocal act or statement of withdrawalâ€ is \r\n  not sufficiently indicative of an intent to withdraw consent.Â  United States \r\n  v. Alfaro, 935 F.2d 64, 67 (5th Cir. 1991).Â  Effective withdrawal of a consent \r\n  to search requires unequivocal conduct, in the form of either an act, statement \r\n  or some combination of the two, that is inconsistent with consent previously \r\n  given.Â  Burton v. United States, 657 A.2d 741 (D.C. 1994).Â  We find Mattisonâ€™s \r\n  act of lowering his hands falls far short of an unequivocal act or statement \r\n  of withdrawal, something found in most withdrawal of consent cases.Â  See \r\n  United States v. Dichiarinte, 445 F.2d 126, 128-29 (7th Cir. 1971) (stating \r\n  defendant exclaimed, â€œThe search is over.Â  I am calling off the search.â€); United \r\n  States v. Miner, 484 F.2d 1075, 1076 (9th Cir. 1973) (finding a withdrawal \r\n  of implied consent to airport search where prospective airline passenger balked \r\n  at search of luggage, saying, â€œNo, itâ€™s personal.â€); United States v. Bily, \r\n  406 F. Supp. 726, 728 (E.D. Pa. 1975) (holding that defendantâ€™s statement, â€œThatâ€™s \r\n  enough.Â  I want you to stop,â€ was a withdrawal of consent); United States \r\n  v. Ibarra, 731 F. Supp. 1037 (D. Wyo. 1990) (noting motoristâ€™s act of closing \r\n  and locking trunk of his car after a police officerâ€™s consensual warrantless \r\n  search of trunk constituted withdrawal of that consent and barred further search); \r\n  Cooper v. State, 480 So. 2d 8 (Ala. Crim. App. 1985) (ruling that although \r\n  first search of airplane was pursuant to voluntarily and freely given consent \r\n  of defendant, his act of locking plane after he taxied plane to hanger area \r\n  and before being driven by police to nearby motel, effectively revoked defendantâ€™s \r\n  consent to any future searches); State v.

Hugh McAngus, of Columbia; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this Workersâ€™ Compensation case, Richard Pratt appeals \r\n  the Circuit Courtâ€™s affirmance of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s order \r\n  denying him benefits.Â  The Commission found Pratt did not sustain an injury \r\n  arising out of and in the course of his employment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRichard Pratt was employed by Morris Roofing, Inc., \r\n  a roofing and subcontracting business co-owned by Paul Morris and Ray Morris.Â  \r\n  Pratt was involved in a single-vehicle collision while driving a Morris Roofing \r\n  truck to work on May 11, 1999, from his home in Savannah, Georgia, to his job \r\n  location in Hilton Head.\r\nMorris Roofing provided transportation to its employees \r\n  in company trucks and vans.Â  The employer charged the employees thirty-five \r\n  dollars per week for this transportation, whether they rode in a work van or \r\n  drove a company truck.\r\nBefore the accident, Pratt occasionally drove a Blazer owned by Morris Roofing.Â  \r\n  Because Pratt had been arriving late to work, Paul Morris had a conversation \r\n  with Pratt on May 10, 1999, and specifically forbade him from taking the company \r\n  vehicle home.Â  Paul instructed Pratt to deliver the vehicle to another employee, \r\n  Tony Wilson, after Pratt completed the job he was working on that day.Â  Paul \r\n  informed Pratt that Wilson would then drive Pratt home and bring him back to \r\n  work the next day.Â  Wilson overheard the colloquy between Pratt and Paul Morris \r\n  and verified the conversation occurred.Â  Wilson stated he waited with the construction \r\n  crew for over two hours for Pratt to appear but he never showed up.\r\nAccording to Ray Morris, Pratt advised him that Paul had prohibited Pratt from \r\n  taking the vehicle home.Â  Pratt asked Ray to overrule Paulâ€™s directive, but \r\n  Ray refused to do so.\r\nDespite contrary instructions from Paul Morris, which were then buttressed \r\n  by Ray Morris, Pratt drove the company vehicle home the night of May 10, 1999.Â  \r\n  He was injured in a single-vehicle accident the next day as he returned to work.\r\nMelanie Adams, a claims specialist with CNA Insurance Company, met with Pratt \r\n  at his apartment the day he was released from the hospital.Â  Adams declared \r\n  Pratt admitted he was not supposed to take the vehicle home the night before \r\n  the accident but decided to take it home anyway against Paul Morrisâ€™ instructions.\r\nPratt testified that he was not forbidden to take the truck home, but merely \r\n  instructed not to take it home if he could not arrive at the job site on time.\r\nPratt alleged he sustained a compensable injury in the accident.Â  The Single \r\n  Commissioner ruled the injury did not arise out of and in the course of Prattâ€™s \r\n  employment.Â  The Commissioner found (1) Pratt knowingly violated his employerâ€™s \r\n  instructions not to take the company vehicle home and (2) the transportation \r\n  was not provided by the employer because Pratt was required to pay for it.Â  \r\n  The Full Commission, [1]  by unanimous vote, affirmed the Commissionerâ€™s \r\n  findings.Â  The Circuit Court affirmed the Full Commission.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nJudicial review of a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision is governed by the substantial \r\n  evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Gray v. Club Group, \r\n  Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 528 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2000); Lake v. Reeder Constr. \r\n  Co., 330 S.C. 242, 498 S.E.2d 650 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In an appeal from the \r\n  Commission, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where \r\n  the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. \r\n  Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); Stephen v. \r\n  Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (Supp. 2001); see also Etheredge v. Monsanto \r\n  Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating court may reverse \r\n  or modify Commissionâ€™s decision if substantial rights of appellant have been \r\n  prejudiced because administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions \r\n  are affected by other error of law).Â  This Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding \r\n  whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or \r\n  is controlled by some error of law.Â  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); see also Lyles v. Quantum Chem. \r\n  Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (in reviewing \r\n  decision of Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, Court of Appeals will not set \r\n  aside its findings unless they are not supported by substantial evidence or \r\n  they are controlled by error of law).\r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence \r\n  viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering \r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion \r\n  the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Etheredge, \r\n  349 S.C. at 456, 562 S.E.2d at 681-82; Broughton v. South of the Border, \r\n  336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The Appellate Panel is the ultimate \r\n  fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact.Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the \r\n  weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy \r\n  v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Parsons v. Georgetown \r\n  Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995); Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, \r\n  526 S.E.2d at 729.Â  The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct \r\n  and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson \r\n  v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont \r\n  Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999).Â  It is not within \r\n  our province to reverse findings of the Commission which are supported by substantial \r\n  evidence.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sphere of Employment\r\nPratt argues the Commission erred in finding that \r\n  his injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.Â  Pratt \r\n  contends he was acting within the scope of employment even though he had been \r\n  instructed not to drive the vehicle.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis Court, in Wright v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 314 S.C. 152, \r\n  442 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. 1994), articulated:\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court has succinctly stated the applicable law \r\n  on this question:\r\n  \r\n  [N]ot every violation of an order given to a workman will \r\n  necessarily remove him from the protection of the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act. \r\n  . . . â€œCertain rules concern the conduct of the workman within the sphere \r\n  of his employment, while others limit the sphere itself.Â Â  A transgression \r\n  of the former class leaves the scope of his employment unchanged, and will not \r\n  prevent the recovery of compensation, while a transgression of the latter sort \r\n  carries the workman outside of the sphere of his employment and compensation \r\n  will be denied.â€\r\n  \r\nJohnson v. Merchants Fertilizer Co., 198 S.C. 373, \r\n  378-379, 17 S.E.2d 695, 697-698 (1941) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  When an employer limits the sphere of employment by specific prohibitions, injuries \r\n  incurred while violating these prohibitions are not in the scope of employment \r\n  and, therefore, not compensable.Â  Black v. Town of Springfield, 217 S.C. \r\n  413, 60 S.E.2d 854 (1950).\r\n\r\nWright, 314 S.C. at 155, 442 S.E.2d at 188 (footnote \r\n  omitted).\r\nIn Wright, the employee and all hourly wage earners \r\n  were prohibited from approaching or apprehending suspected shoplifters.Â  Wright \r\n  ignored this rule.Â  The Court found that â€œWright left the sphere of his employment \r\n  by violating the specific orders not to confront, pursue, or apprehend suspected \r\n  shoplifters.â€Â  Id.Â  He was thus not entitled to Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  benefits.\r\nPratt invites the Courtâ€™s attention to Howell \r\n  v. Kash &amp; Karry, 264 S.C. 298, 214 S.E.2d 821 (1975).Â  In Howell, \r\n  the Court affirmed an award of compensation to a grocery store bag boy who injured \r\n  himself while chasing someone who had snatched a purse from a potential customer \r\n  outside the store.Â  The Court held that a good faith act outside the employeeâ€™s \r\n  regular duties is compensable if undertaken to advance the employerâ€™s interest, \r\n  even if the act does not further the employeeâ€™s assigned tasks.Â  Acts furthering \r\n  the employerâ€™s interest were identified: (1) recovery of the customerâ€™s money, \r\n  thereby enabling her to spend it in the store; and (2) the customer good-will \r\n  created by the bag boyâ€™s act.Â  Most importantly, there is no indication in Howell \r\n  that the employer had specifically prohibited the bag boy from chasing purse \r\n  snatchers, shoplifters, or any other type of fleeing criminal suspect.\r\nIn the present case, the testimony reveals Pratt \r\n  was acting against specific orders from his employer.Â  During direct examination, \r\n  Paul Morris stated:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  So, [Pratt] drove it home at least on the 9th and he \r\n  drove it to Moss Creek on the 10th?\r\nA.Â  Yeah.Â  Well, the 9th â€“ on the 10th, the day before the \r\n  accident, he â€“ the homeowner called me.Â  [Pratt] wasnâ€™t there.Â Â  They told me \r\n  he was going to be there at a certain time and he didnâ€™t get there on time.Â  \r\n  So, when he went and had communications with me, I told him that he couldnâ€™t \r\n  drive the truck home because he was late to the job.\r\nQ.Â  All right.\r\nA.Â  That ended that conversation about the truck.\r\n . . .\r\nQ.Â  And the â€“ what time did he leave Moss Creek [that night]?\r\nA.Â  I couldnâ€™t tell you the time he left Moss Creek.Â  I told \r\n  him to come to Sea Pines that â€“ to meet the guys and Tony would take him home \r\n  and he came and seen my younger brother at the office when he went to pick the \r\n  sprayer up and he said that I told him not to drive the truck and wanted to \r\n  know if he could and Ray told him he canâ€™t because I run the men.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Paul declared:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  Had you had trouble with Ricky Pratt not being on time \r\n  before?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  All right.Â  The day before this accident occurred, was \r\n  he late?\r\nA.Â  Yes, he was.\r\nQ.Â  And is that what resulted in your conversation with him, \r\n  that you couldnâ€™t have customers complain?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  Absolutely, yes, it was.\r\nQ.Â  And as a result of that, you told him not to take the \r\n  truck home again?\r\nA.Â  I did.\r\nQ.Â  Correct?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  And it was your intent that the van was going to pick \r\n  him up and drive him to the shop?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\n . . .\r\nQ.Â  And you found out at that point that Ricky [Pratt] had \r\n  not showed up with the truck?\r\nA.Â  Absolutely.\r\nQ.Â  Now, that was in violation of your specific instructions \r\n  to him?\r\nA.Â  Yes, it was.\r\nQ.Â  And that you had a business reason for doing that which \r\n  is to keep your customers happy and get him to work on time?\r\nA.Â  Yes, it was.\r\n\r\nMelanie Adams, the CNA claims specialist, testified \r\n  regarding her conversation with Pratt at his apartment: \r\n\r\nQ.Â  What did you ask him or what did you talk with him about, \r\n  about the day before the accident?\r\nA.Â  I asked him if he knew â€“ I specifically asked him if \r\n  he knew he was not supposed to take the company truck home that evening.Â  And \r\n  he said â€“\r\nQ.Â  Thatâ€™s something you found out from â€“\r\nA.Â  Well, I â€“ yes.\r\nQ.Â  Through investigation?\r\nA. The work comp adjustor had advised me that she had information \r\n  that he was not supposed to use that truck and I had spoken with some of our \r\n  insureds.Â  I had spoken with Paul and several other people.Â  And so, yes, I \r\n  was aware that the information was he was not to use the truck. So, I asked \r\n  him pointblank did you know you werenâ€™t supposed to use the truck.\r\nQ.Â  And what was his response?\r\nA.Â  He said he knew it.\r\nQ.Â Â  Did he tell you why he took the truck?\r\nA.Â  He said he didnâ€™t want to fool with having to take it \r\n  back to meet the guys.Â  Something to that effect.Â  I didnâ€™t want to fool with \r\n  it, it was too much trouble.Â  Something to that effect.\r\nQ.Â  That he knew he was not supposed to take the truck home?\r\nA.Â  He did admit that he did â€“ knew he was not to use the \r\n  truck.\r\n\r\nTony Wilson stated:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  Iâ€™ll repeat the question.Â  Did you overhear a conversation \r\n  between Paul and Ricky about Ricky being able to use the truck and taking the \r\n  truck?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  What did you hear discussed?\r\nA.Â  Paul had finally gotten a hold of Ricky and Paul was \r\n  on the job, I was standing right beside Paul Morris.Â  He told Ricky, said that \r\n  afternoon, because he was not getting to work on time, that it would be â€“ before \r\n  he left the island to bring the Blazer to me at my job in Sea Pines and I was \r\n  to take Ricky home and bring the Blazer to Paul Morrisâ€™ house.\r\nQ.Â  Now, did you ever see Ricky Pratt that day?\r\nA.Â  No, sir.\r\n\r\nWilson further expounded:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  Weâ€™ve talked about a conversation Paul had with Ricky, \r\n  right?Â  You were â€“ you heard that?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  And youâ€™ve already testified that he told him not to \r\n  take the truck home?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  But to deliver it to you, right?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  Did he discuss with him how he was supposed to get to \r\n  work the next day?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir, he did.Â  He told me and he told Ricky on the \r\n  phone that he would have someone come and pick him up the next morning.\r\n\r\nRelying on Hines v. Hendricks Canning Co., \r\n  263 S.C. 399, 405, 211 S.E.2d 220, 222-23 (1975), which determined â€œthe opinions \r\n  of the Supreme Court of North Carolina construing [the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  A]ct are entitled to great weight,â€ Pratt cites Hoyle v. Isenhour Brick &amp; \r\n  Tile Co., 293 S.E.2d 196 (N.C. 1982), to support his position.Â  Hoyle \r\n  is inapposite to the instant case.Â  In Hoyle, the evidence showed the \r\n  employee was faced with the choice of abandoning the furtherance of his employerâ€™s \r\n  business or acting in contravention of a previous order.Â  The Hoyle court \r\n  enunciated:\r\n\r\nLikewise, disobedience of a direct and specific order by \r\n  a then present superior breaks the causal relation between the employment and \r\n  the resulting injury.Â  This is patently so; the employeeâ€™s subjective belief \r\n  concerning the advisability of his course of action becomes irrelevant since \r\n  there would be no room for doubt as how best to serve his employerâ€™s interest \r\n  in the face of the employerâ€™s direct and immediate order.Â  Conversely, when \r\n  there is a rule or a prior order and the employee is faced with the choice of \r\n  remaining idle in compliance with the rule or order or continuing to further \r\n  his employerâ€™s business, no superior being present, the employer who would reap \r\n  the benefits of the employeeâ€™s acts if successfully completed should bear the \r\n  burden of injury resulting from such acts.Â  Under such circumstances, engaging \r\n  in an activity which is outside the narrow confines of the employeeâ€™s job description, \r\n  but which is reasonably related to the accomplishment of the task for which \r\n  the employee was hired, does not ordinarily constitute a departure from the \r\n  scope of employment.\r\n. . . We are therefore of the opinion that employeeâ€™s election \r\n  to disobey a prior given order did not break the causal connection between his \r\n  employment and his fatal injury if the disobedient act was reasonably related \r\n  to the accomplishment of the task for which he was hired. . . .\r\n\r\nHoyle, 293 S.E.2d at 202-203 (citations omitted).Â  \r\n  The court based its decision on the fact that the employee was acting in furtherance \r\n  of the employerâ€™s business, even though he was disobeying the employerâ€™s order.\r\nHere, the facts are dissimilar and contrastive.Â  \r\n  Thus, Hoyle has no precedential value.\r\nWe conclude the testimony in the record is sufficient \r\n  to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that Pratt chose to drive the truck home \r\n  in violation of his employerâ€™s prohibition, thus acting outside the scope of \r\n  his employment.Â  We hold Pratt left the sphere of his employment by violating \r\n  the specific order to deliver the vehicle to Tony Wilson.Â  Consequently, Pratt \r\n  was not entitled to Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEfficacy of â€œGoing and Coming Ruleâ€/Furnishing of\r\n   Transportation by Employer\r\n\r\n\r\n Pratt maintains the Circuit Court erred in\r\ndetermining the employer did not furnish transportation to him.&nbsp;\r\nWe reject this argument.\r\nPratt testified:\r\n\r\n  Q.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;\r\n  Were there any deductions from your hundred dollars a day?\r\n  A.&nbsp; Just workmanâ€™s comp, you\r\n  know.\r\n  Q.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;\r\n  Were there any deductions or payments between you and the company\r\n  relevant to transportation?\r\n  A.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;\r\n  He took out for gas.\r\n  Q.&nbsp; And how much was that?\r\n  A.&nbsp; I think it was 25 a week.&nbsp;\r\n  I think.&nbsp; I donâ€™t\r\n  remember.\r\n  Q.&nbsp; And was there any difference\r\n  in the 25 or â€“ dollars a week, or whatever figure was correct, when you\r\n  drove than when you were not driving?\r\n  A.&nbsp; No.\r\n\r\nRay Morris stated:\r\n\r\n  Q.&nbsp; What was\r\n  your arrangement for transportation of your employees?\r\n  A.&nbsp; The ones that did not have a\r\n  vehicle or no means of transportation to pick them up from their house and\r\n  drop them off at their house.&nbsp; We\r\n  charged them $35 a week.\r\n\r\nUnder the â€œgoing and coming rule,â€ an employee going\r\nto or coming from the place where his work is to be performed is not engaged in\r\nperforming any service growing out of and incidental to his employment, and,\r\ntherefore, an injury sustained by accident at such time does not arise out of\r\nand in the course of his employment.&nbsp; Medlin\r\nv.

The circuit court affirmed the disability \r\naward and reversed the award of medical payments. Claimant appeals the circuit \r\ncourt's reversal of the award of medical payments. Murrells Inlet VFW #10420 and \r\nNational Union Fire Insurance Company (collectively \"Employer\") also appeal. We \r\naffirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nClaimant suffered an admitted back injury on March 17, 1995, \r\n  while performing her duties as a bartender. Employer paid workers' compensation \r\n  benefits after the accident.\r\n\r\nClaimant visited various doctors between 1995 and 1997 in \r\n  South Carolina and North Carolina and was referred to Duke University Medical \r\n  Center in North Carolina, Coastal Orthopaedics in South Carolina, and Emory \r\n  University Spine Center in Georgia. In August of 1997, Dr. William Horton at \r\n  the Emory Spine Center independently evaluated Claimant. Employer denied Claimant's \r\n  request for authorization to receive treatment from Dr. Horton.\r\n\r\nClaimant filed a Form 50 on November 6, 1997, seeking additional \r\n  treatments from Dr. Horton. Employer admitted the accident, denied Claimant \r\n  was entitled to medical payments for Dr. Horton's treatments, and argued Claimant \r\n  had reached maximum medical improvement (\"MMI\"). After an August 19, 1998 hearing, \r\n  the single commissioner found Claimant had not reached MMI and ordered Employer \r\n  to pay for medical treatment provided by Dr. Horton. Employer appealed. The \r\n  full commission found Claimant reached MMI on March 9, 1998, upon her release \r\n  by her treating physician, Dr. Wilkins. At the hearing before the full commission, \r\n  Claimant sought to introduce a letter from Dr. Horton, which was not included \r\n  in the record before the single commissioner. The commission refused to admit \r\n  the letter, noting instead that the letter would provide Claimant with \"the \r\n  opportunity for a change of condition\" request.\r\n\r\nThe commission found a 25% permanent impairment to Claimant's \r\n  back. As explained by the circuit court: \"The [commission] also found that the \r\n  treatment rendered by Dr. Horton as indicated in the record at that time and \r\n  considered by the Single Commissioner did not arise out of the accident, and \r\n  also found that [Employer] was not responsible for such treatment. There was \r\n  no appeal from this order.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1999, Claimant filed a Form 50 for a change \r\n  in condition \"as evidenced by attached medical documentation and additional \r\n  medical documentation which may be submitted.\" As medical documentation, Claimant \r\n  relied on patient notes and two letters from Dr. Horton, and patient notes and \r\n  a letter from Dr. John Glaser, another treating physician. Dr. Horton's notes, \r\n  dated June 12, 1997, stated that Claimant \"might well be a candidate for endoscopic \r\n  fusion.\" Dr. Horton reiterated in a letter to Claimant dated January 30, 1998: \r\n  \"I would tell you that surgery remains a possibility although I cannot yet definitely \r\n  recommend it.\" In the second letter to Claimant's attorney, dated August 18, \r\n  1998, Dr. Horton wrote: \"Assuming L5-S1 is the source of her pain, a successful \r\n  fusion at L5-S1 would very likely decrease the tenure and/or severity of [Claimant's] \r\n  pain and impairment.\" Dr. Glaser's patient notes and letter dated October 14, \r\n  1998, corroborated Dr. Horton's recommendation for surgery. In his notes, Dr. \r\n  Glaser wrote: \"I basically agree with what Dr. Horton had to say. I think surgery \r\n  is an option for her.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1999, Employer filed a Form 51 denying a \r\n  change of condition. The single commissioner found Claimant had experienced \r\n  a change in condition effective August 18, 1998, the date of Dr. Horton's second \r\n  letter and reinstated Claimant's TTD. The commissioner further found Employer \r\n  should be responsible for Claimant's previous evaluations and treatment, and \r\n  for further evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment and surgery by Dr. William \r\n  Horton or his designees as \"it has been shown that such treatment may tend to \r\n  lessen the tenure and severity of Claimant's disability pursuant to 42-17-90.\"\r\n\r\nBy order filed January 11, 2000, the full commission affirmed \r\n  the single commissioner. Employer appealed to the circuit court. While the matter \r\n  was pending before the circuit court, Claimant filed a motion to compel reinstatement \r\n  of TTD. By order dated June 12, 2000, the Honorable Howard P. King, circuit \r\n  court judge, affirmed the finding of a change in condition but reversed the \r\n  award of medical payments for out-of-state providers concluding \"the Commission \r\n  lacks the authority to order additional treatment outside the state.\" Judge \r\n  King thus ordered further proceedings by the full commission regarding Claimant's \r\n  treatment. Employer and Claimant appealed to this court.\r\n\r\nBy order filed November 1, 2000, the Honorable John L. Breeden, \r\n  Jr. acted on the pending motion to compel past-due medical payments. Judge Breeden \r\n  ordered Employer to pay accrued installment payments for TTD from August 18, \r\n  1998, and imposed a penalty. Employer appealed this order. \r\n\r\nEmployer's Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Is Judge King's order finding a change in condition, \r\n  reinstating Claimant's TTD, and requiring Employer to cover future medical care \r\n  and treatment, supported by substantial evidence? (1)\r\n\r\n2. Did the commission exceed its authority in ordering Employer to pay for Claimant's medical bills under S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 42-17-90?\r\n\r\n3. Did Judge Breeden have jurisdiction to rule on Claimant's motion to compel \r\n  payment of past due workers' compensation benefits?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nClaimant's Issue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Did Judge King err in concluding any medical treatment to which Claimant is entitled should be performed only in South\r\nCarolina by a physician chosen by Employer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe determination of whether a claimant experiences a change \r\n  of condition is a question for the fact finder.  Krell v. S.C. State Hwy.\r\nDept., \r\n  237 S.C. 584, 588, 118 S.E.2d 322, 323-24 (1961). In Krell, our supreme court \r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the province of this Court to determine whether \r\n  the greater weight of the evidence supported the finding that a change had taken \r\n  place in the condition of the claimant such as would warrant an extension or \r\n  enlargement of the award, or whether the greater weight of the evidence supported \r\n  the finding that such change resulted from the injury . . . . Such facts must \r\n  be determined by those whose duty it is to find the facts. \r\n\r\n\r\n237 S.C. at 588, 118 S.E.2d at 323-24 (quoting  Cromer v. \r\n  Newberry Cotton Mills, 201 S.C. 349, 371, 23 S.E.2d 19, 28 (1942)). The Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act establishes the substantial evidence standard of review for factual \r\n  findings made by the commission.  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 133, 276 \r\n  S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981). Under the substantial evidence standard of review, this \r\n  court may reverse the commission's findings only when they are unsupported by \r\n  substantial evidence. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (Supp. 2001).  See\r\n Brayboy \r\n  v. Clark Heating Co., 306 S.C. 56, 58, 409 S.E.2d 767, 768 (1991) (citing the \r\n  substantial evidence standard of review in an action for change of condition).\r\n\r\n\"'Substantial evidence' is not a mere scintilla of \r\n  evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence \r\n  which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in \r\n  order to justify its action.\" Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306. The \r\n  \"possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does \r\n  not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial \r\n  evidence.\"  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn., 282 S.C. 430, \r\n  432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984).\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nEMPLOYER'S APPEAL\r\n\r\n1. Change of condition\r\n\r\nInitially, Employer argues Judge King improperly considered \r\n  Claimant's Form 50 regarding a change of condition rather than requiring Claimant \r\n  to have appealed the commission's order of December 30, 1998, which found MMI \r\n  effective March 9, 1998. Employer further argues the commission erred, in any \r\n  event, by finding a change of condition entitling Claimant to further medical \r\n  treatment and additional TTD payments.\r\n\r\nIn the change of condition action, the full commission found \r\n  Claimant experienced a change of condition effective August 18, 1998, the date \r\n  of the final letter from Dr. Horton in which he noted that additional surgery \r\n  \"would very likely decrease the tenure and/or severity of [Claimant's] pain \r\n  and impairment.\" Employer argues Dr. Horton's letter \"was presented at the first \r\n  hearing. . . . [and] was explicitly rejected.\" Thus, the condition now asserted \r\n  by Claimant existed when the commission entered its December 30, 1998 order.\r\n\r\nGenerally, an appeal of a workers' \r\n  compensation order is concerned with the conditions prior to and at the time \r\n  of the original award of the commission. Review for a change of condition is \r\n  concerned with conditions that have arisen thereafter.  Causby v. Rock Hill Printing \r\n  &amp; Finishing Co., 249 S.C. 225, 228, 153 S.E.2d 697, 698-99 (1967). If the \r\n  parties to the dispute fail to timely appeal the final award of the full commission, \r\n  then its order \"is conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-60 (Supp. 2001). Review as a change of condition is not available \r\n  as an alternative to, or substitute for, an appeal. Causby, 249 S.C. at 227, \r\n  153 S.E.2d at 698-99. However, where a claimant shows a change of condition, \r\n  \"the Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, \r\n  diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded. . . .\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-17-90 (1985).\r\n\r\n At the initial hearing on December 16, 1998, the commission \r\n  limited its determination to the facts considered by the commissioner, despite \r\n  Claimant's attempt to supplement the record with Dr. \r\n  Horton's August 18, 1998 letter. The commission's chairman, in excluding Dr. \r\n  Horton's letter, opined that the letter was more appropriate in an action for \r\n  a change of condition. Because the commission limited its order to a determination \r\n  of Claimant's condition prior to August of 1998, subsequent events, including \r\n  Dr. Horton's changed diagnosis in August of 1998, were appropriate for consideration \r\n  in an action alleging a change of condition. \r\nA change in condition occurs when the claimant experiences \r\n  a change in physical condition as a result of her original injury, occurring \r\n  after the first award. Causby, 249 S.C. at 227, 153 S.E.2d at 698. To justify \r\n  a modification of an award based on a change of condition, the claimant must \r\n  show the change in condition and its causal connection to the original compensable \r\n  accident. Krell, 237 S.C. at 588, 118 S.E.2d at 323. \"[T]he \r\n  issue before the Commission is sharply restricted to the question of extent \r\n  of improvement or worsening of the injury on which the original award was based.\"\r\n \r\n  Id. at 588-89, 118 S.E.2d at 324. In  Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls,\r\nInc., \r\n  this court explained:\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has recognized the purpose of . . . [permitting \r\n  an action for a change of condition] is to allow the commission to terminate \r\n  compensation in cases where the change in condition amounts to a complete recovery; \r\n  to increase compensation where the facts of the case reveal that the change \r\n  in condition is for the worse; and to allow it to diminish compensation where \r\n  the change in condition is for the better.\r\n\r\n325 S.C. 532, 537, 482 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe commission found Claimant experienced a change in condition \r\n  based in part upon the continued evaluations by Dr. Horton. Dr. Horton reviewed \r\n  Claimant's updated diagnostic tests including a discogram, \r\n  bone scan, and MRI, and opined that a surgical procedure would likely improve \r\n  Claimant's pain level and function and very likely \"decrease the tenure and/or \r\n  severity of [her] pain and impairment.\" (2) Both Dr. Horton \r\n  and Dr. Glaser recommended Claimant undergo further evaluation and back surgery. \r\n  Dr. Horton further concluded that \"a successful fusion at L5-S1 would very likely \r\n  decrease the tenure and/or severity of [Claimant's] pain and impairment.\"\r\n\r\nWe find substantial evidence supports the commission's \r\n  determination that Claimant experienced a change of condition entitling her \r\n  to further treatment.  See  Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, \r\n  583, 514 S.E.2d 593, 596-97 (Ct. App. 1999) (Although a claimant has reached \r\n  MMI, if additional medical care or treatment would tend to lessen the period \r\n  of disability, the full commission may be warranted in requiring such treatment.).\r\n\r\n2. Section 42-17-90\r\nEmployer next argues the commission exceeded its authority \r\n  in ordering Employer to pay for Claimant's medical \r\n  bills under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-17-90 permits the commission to review an application \r\n  for benefits based on a change of condition and \"make \r\n  an award ending, diminishing or increasing the  compensation previously awarded \r\n  . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90 (1985) (emphasis added). Employer argues \r\n  the commission is limited to a compensatory award and does not have the authority \r\n  to order the payment of medical bills.\r\nIn  Davis v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, our \r\n  supreme court rejected a similar argument. 289 S.C. 123, 125, 345 S.E.2d 245, \r\n  246 (1986). Inmate Davis worked as a kitchen helper while serving his youthful \r\n  offender sentence. He injured his back and sought workers' \r\n  compensation benefits. The single commissioner and full commission concluded \r\n  the injury was compensable and awarded Davis temporary total benefits and medical \r\n  benefits. The circuit court reversed. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-480 \r\n  (1976), our supreme court reinstated the full commission's award.  Id. \r\n\r\nSection 42-1-480 provides:\r\n\r\nAny inmate of the State Department of Corrections, . . . \r\n  in the performance of his work in connection with the maintenance of the institution, \r\n  . . . who suffers an injury for which compensation is specifically prescribed \r\n  in this Title, may, upon being released from such institution[,] . . . be awarded \r\n  and paid compensation under the provisions of this Title.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-480 (1985) (emphasis added). The circuit \r\n  court in  Davis held the term \"compensation\" under \r\n  section 42-1-480 excluded medical payments. Davis, 289 S.C. at 124-25, 345 S.E.2d \r\n  at 246. The supreme court disagreed stating:\r\n\r\nThe Worker's Compensation Act \r\n  should be liberally construed in furtherance of the purposes for which it was \r\n  designed. Any reasonable doubts as to construction should be resolved in favor \r\n  of the claimant by including him within the coverage of the Act rather than \r\n  excluding him. It would require a strained construction of the Act to allow \r\n  a former inmate compensation for permanent disability, yet deny him the medical \r\n  treatment which may prevent his injury from resulting in permanent disability.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 125, 345 S.E.2d at 246 (citation omitted).\r\nWe likewise hold that the term \"compensation\" \r\n  does not preclude the commission from awarding medical benefits to a claimant \r\n  under section 42-17-90.\r\n3. Motion to Compel\r\nEmployer finally argues Judge Breeden lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to hear and issue an order on Claimant's motion to \r\n  compel past-due total temporary disability payments for two reasons. First, \r\n  Claimant failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion to preserve the issue after Judge \r\n  King's order was filed. Second, once the final order was appealed to this court, \r\n  the circuit court lost jurisdiction of the case. We disagree.\r\n\r\nClaimant based her motion to compel payment of past-due \r\n  TTD on the full commission's January 2000 order, which \r\n  found a change in condition effective August 18, 1998. Though the initial circuit \r\n  court hearing was identified as \"[Claimant's] motion to compel the payment of \r\n  benefits,\" the parties principally argued the merits. Because Claimant's right \r\n  to receive arrearages was not resolved with finality until the order of June \r\n  12, 2000, it would have been premature to move to compel until then. The motion \r\n  to compel payments is a separate issue from the propriety of awarding them in \r\n  the first place.\r\n\r\nCircuit courts generally lose subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  of a case when a notice of appeal is filed and served. However, our appellate \r\n  court rules provide that \"[n]othing . . . shall prohibit \r\n  the lower court . . . from proceeding with matters  not affected by the\r\nappeal.&quot; \r\n  Rule 204, SCACR (emphasis added). \"Although service of notice of an intent to \r\n  appeal divests the lower court of jurisdiction over the order appealed, the \r\n  lower court retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by the\r\nappeal.&quot;  Jackson \r\n  v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 311, 486 S.E.2d 750, 761 (1997) (After defendants' timely \r\n  appeal of the jury's verdict, the trial judge had jurisdiction to determine \r\n  attorney's fee award to plaintiffs where plaintiffs had requested attorney's \r\n  fees prior to the appeal and defendants failed to appeal the propriety of awarding \r\n  attorney's fees pursuant to the statute.).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we conclude Judge Breeden had jurisdiction \r\n  to rule on Claimant's motion to compel payments, which \r\n  need not be presented first to the full commission.  See  McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly \r\n  Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 472, 313 S.E.2d 38, 41 (Ct. App. 1984) (circuit \r\n  court had jurisdiction over motion to compel disability payments).\r\n\r\nCLAIMANT'S \r\n  APPEAL\r\n\r\n1. Out-of-State Medical Providers\r\nClaimant argues Judge King erred in concluding that any \r\n  medical treatments she receives must be performed in South Carolina. Employer \r\n  argues the statutory and regulatory schemes require a claimant to accept the \r\n  medical provider chosen by the employer. \r\nRegulation 67-509 states that while a claimant is receiving \r\n  temporary compensation benefits, \"[t]he employer's \r\n  representative chooses an authorized health care provider and pays for authorized \r\n  treatment.\" S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-509(A) (1990). However, section 42-15-60 \r\n  of the Worker's Compensation Act provides, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical . . . treatment . . . shall be provided by the employer.\r\n \r\n  In case of a controversy arising between employer and employee, the Commission \r\n  may order such further medical, surgical, hospital or other treatment as may \r\n  in the discretion of the Commission be necessary. . . . [T]he employer may, \r\n  at his own option, continue to furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge \r\n  to the employee, and the employee shall accept an attending physician,  unless \r\n  otherwise ordered by the Commission. . . . The refusal of an employee to accept \r\n  any medical, hospital, surgical or other treatment when provided by the employer \r\n  or ordered by the Commission shall bar such employee from further compensation \r\n  until such refusal ceases and no compensation shall at any time be paid for \r\n  the period of suspension  unless in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances \r\n  justified the refusal, in which case the Commission may order a change in the \r\n  medical or hospital service.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\"[T]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the \r\n  court must ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature, and in interpreting \r\n  a statute, the court must give the words their plain and ordinary meaning without \r\n  resorting to a tortured construction which limits or expands the statute's \r\n  operation.\"  State v. Dickinson, 339 S.C. 194, 199, 528 S.E.2d 675, 677 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000). \"Statutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair \r\n  interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.\"  \r\n  TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, \r\n  478 (1998).\r\n\r\nThe full commission is afforded much discretion under Section \r\n  42-15-60. Where it deems it necessary, the commission may override an employer's \r\n  choice of medical provider and may excuse a claimant's \"justified\" refusal to \r\n  seek treatment from employer's provider. In these circumstances, \"the Commission \r\n  may order a change in the medical or hospital service\" provided the claimant. \r\n  Section 42-15-60 does not require the commission to limit its choice of medical \r\n  care to providers in South Carolina. Absent a specific directive by the legislature \r\n  to the contrary, we decline to read such a requirement into the statute.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the portion of the \r\n  circuit court's order finding substantial evidence in the record supported the \r\n  full commission's finding of a change of condition. We likewise affirm the award \r\n  of arrearages and penalties based on Claimant's motion to compel. Finally, we \r\n  reverse that portion of the order concluding the commission did not have the \r\n  discretion to order Employer to pay for medical treatment rendered to Claimant \r\n  by her out-of-state medical providers and reinstate the full commission's award. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nSHULER, J. concurs.\r\nSTILWELL, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J.: (dissenting).  \r\n  I respectfully dissent. I agree with the majority's analysis of and conclusion \r\n  regarding the motion to compel, but disagree with the decision affirming the \r\n  finding of a change of condition and reinstating temporary total disability \r\n  (TTD). I would therefore find it unnecessary to address the issue concerning \r\n  treatment by out-of-state medical providers.\r\nThe initial hearing before the single commissioner was held \r\n  on August 19, 1998. The resulting order was appealed to the full commission \r\n  which, among other things, refused to allow into evidence a letter from Dr. \r\n  Horton, found Claimant sustained a 25% permanent impairment to her back and \r\n  had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) on March 9, 1998 when she was \r\n  released by her treating physician. No appeal was taken from that order. If \r\n  the parties to a dispute fail to timely appeal the final award of the commission, \r\n  then its order \"is conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-60 (Supp. 2001). \r\nWe are now asked to affirm an award for a change of condition \r\n  based on that letter from Dr. Horton which was dated the day before the initial \r\n  hearing. I have difficulty justifying an award for a change of condition based \r\n  on a condition which admittedly existed prior to the initial award. \r\n\"[A] change in condition means a change in the physical \r\n  condition of the claimant as a result of the original injury, occurring after \r\n  the first award.\"  Cromer v. Newberry Cotton Mills, 201 S.C. 349, 357, 23 S.E.2d \r\n  19, 22 (1942). It \"can consist of either a change in the claimant's physical \r\n  condition that impacts his earning capacity, a change in the claimant's earning \r\n  capacity even though claimant's physical condition remains unchanged, or a change \r\n  in the degree of disability even though claimant's physical condition remains \r\n  unchanged.\"  Blair v. Am. Tel. &amp; Communications Corp., 477 S.E.2d 190, 192 \r\n  (N.C. Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted). (3)\r\nNot having appealed the full commission order finding MMI, \r\n  Claimant is bound by it, \r\n\r\nsubject of course to her right to review of it upon change \r\n  of condition as prescribed by Section [42-17-90]. But her suggestion here that \r\n  review under Section [42-17-90] was available to her as an alternative to, or \r\n  substitute for, an appeal, is without merit. An appeal is concerned with conditions \r\n  prior to and at the time of the original Opinion and Award, whereas review under \r\n  Section [42-17-90] is concerned with conditions that have arisen thereafter. \r\n  \r\n\r\nCausby&nbsp;v.

Craven Reg'l Med. Ctr., 468 S.E.2d 269, 274 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996). In\r\nLewis, where claimant complained of scar tissue, increased pain, and a continuing \r\n  condition present during the first award, the court held no change of condition \r\n  had been proven because \"this development and continuing incapacity is 'of the \r\n  same kind and character and for the same injury' that gave rise to plaintiff's \r\n  [initial] compensation . . . .\"  Id.\r\nClaimant admitted in testimony before the single commissioner \r\n  on the change of condition that she had initially requested surgery, which was \r\n  denied. She testified the pain was slightly worse but that she was essentially \r\n  claiming the same treatment for the same condition on which the initial award \r\n  was based. As Claimant's counsel conceded in the initial hearing before the \r\n  full commission, \"the condition is what it is now. It wouldn't constitute a \r\n  change later.\" Dr. Horton's August&nbsp;18, 1998 letter noted that additional \r\n  surgery \"would very likely decrease the tenure and/or severity of Ms. Gattis' \r\n  pain and impairment.\" As Employer noted, this \"evidence from Dr. Horton was \r\n  presented at the first hearing . . . [and] was explicitly rejected.\" There is \r\n  no evidence a medical change has occurred since the initial hearing, and Claimant \r\n  produced no evidence about nor did she argue any change in her earning capacity. \r\n  \r\nI would, therefore, reverse that portion of the order reinstating \r\n  TTD and authorizing additional and continuing treatment.\r\n1.

Parker, of Hampton; \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Gold Kist, Inc. appeals from \r\n  two circuit court orders finding it was prohibited from enforcing an arbitration \r\n  agreement adopted by an amendment to its bylaws.Â  Gold Kist argues that by signing \r\n  a membership agreement, McMillan was bound by Gold Kistâ€™s subsequently adopted \r\n  arbitration policy.Â  We agree and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nGold Kist is an agricultural cooperative organized \r\n  under and governed by the Georgia Cooperative Marketing Act and the Georgia \r\n  Non-Profit Code.Â  Gold Kistâ€™s membership consists of farmers, and the members \r\n  elect the Board of Directors, which governs the cooperative. Gold Kist maintained \r\n  a retail facility in Allendale, South Carolina, which sold farming supplies \r\n  until October 13, 1998.Â  The stock of the retail facility was delivered from \r\n  out of state.Â  \r\nMcMillan, a farmer, applied for membership \r\n  with Gold Kist on January 24, 1986, by signing a â€œMembership, Marketing, And/Or \r\n  Purchasing Agreement of Gold Kist.â€Â  The Agreement provided that by signing \r\n  up for a membership, new members agreed to abide by the bylaws of Gold Kist \r\n  then in effect as well as any bylaws the board of directors adopted in the future. \r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1991, McMillan signed an \r\n  acknowledgment that he received a copy of his membership agreement with Gold \r\n  Kist.Â  The agreement provided, among other things, that by signing a membership \r\n  agreement:\r\n\r\n[t]he member will be eligible for the benefits of membership \r\n  and also that the member will honor and abide by the rules of membership as \r\n  contained in the cooperativeâ€™s Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, and Board \r\n  of Directorsâ€™ policies, all of which may be changed from time to time.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nAlthough no arbitration policy had previously \r\n  existed, Gold Kistâ€™s Board of Directors adopted an arbitration policy on October \r\n  28, 1993.Â  The policy stated that any disputes between Gold Kist and its members \r\n  were subject to arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the \r\n  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.Â  The policy \r\n  also provided that it did not apply to â€œany purchases or sales between Gold \r\n  Kist and members, or any contracts for such purchases or sales, if the transactions \r\n  were completed or the contracts executed prior to the effective date of this \r\n  policy.â€Â  The policy became effective January 1, 1994.Â  \r\nOn the same date, Gold Kist amended its bylaws \r\n  to reflect the new arbitration policy.Â  The amendment to the bylaws provided:\r\n\r\nSection 7.Â  Disputes Between Gold Kist and Members:Â  Remedies.\r\n  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Arbitration.Â  Gold Kist and members will submit to binding arbitration \r\n  all disputes between the parties, whether governed by federal, state, or international \r\n  contract law, tort law, statute or treaty, and irrespective of the form of relief \r\n  sought, relating to or arising out of matters of a type declared by Gold Kistâ€™s \r\n  Board of Directors before the dispute arises to be of a type covered by Gold \r\n  Kistâ€™s arbitration policy. All such arbitrations shall be according to rules \r\n  and procedures adopted from time to time by Gold Kistâ€™s Board of Directors.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe board of directors amended the bylaws again \r\n  on October 25, 1996, and the arbitration section included in the 1993 amendment \r\n  was also included in the 1996 amendment.Â  \r\nMcMillan purchased lime for use on his farm from \r\n  Gold Kistâ€™s Allendale, South Carolina, store in 1996 and 1997.Â  The lime originated \r\n  in Tennessee.Â  McMillan apparently failed to pay for the products purchased \r\n  from Gold Kist.Â  \r\nOn November 27, 2000, Gold Kist sent McMillan a \r\n  demand for arbitration, alleging that McMillan owed it $57,337.40.Â  On January \r\n  30, 2001, McMillan filed two actions in circuit court against Gold Kist:Â  (1) \r\n  an action seeking damages for $75,000 in losses allegedly caused by defective \r\n  lime sold by Gold Kist or negligently applied by Gold Kist, resulting in damage \r\n  to his farm and decreased crop yield; and (2) an action seeking a declaratory \r\n  judgment that McMillan was not required to arbitrate his dispute with Gold Kist.Â  \r\n  He also sought a restraining order prohibiting Gold Kist from proceeding with \r\n  the arbitration.Â  Gold Kist denied McMillanâ€™s allegations and filed motions \r\n  to stay McMillanâ€™s action for damages and to compel arbitration.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the circuit court issued two \r\n  orders.Â  Regarding Gold Kistâ€™s motion to stay McMillanâ€™s action for damages \r\n  and to compel arbitration, the circuit court found that Gold Kist had failed \r\n  to prove McMillan was aware of the arbitration policy in the bylaws or that \r\n  he had agreed to be subject to the amendment.Â  Looking to the section of the \r\n  Georgia Code of Laws governing agricultural cooperatives, the circuit court \r\n  noted that section 2-10-86 did not authorize bylaws mandating arbitration.Â  \r\n  The circuit court determined that because Gold Kist failed to show McMillan \r\n  consented to change the terms of the original membership agreement to include \r\n  a mandatory arbitration clause, the arbitration policy did not apply to McMillan.Â  \r\n  The court denied Gold Kistâ€™s motion to stay damages and to compel arbitration.Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 24, 2001, the circuit court issued an order \r\n  ruling on McMillanâ€™s declaratory judgment action.Â  Relying on the same considerations \r\n  from the previous order, the circuit court determined the arbitration policy \r\n  was not binding upon McMillan.Â  Gold Kist appeals from both orders.Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhere, as here, the existence of a membership agreement \r\n  is not in question, the construction of the agreement is a matter of law.Â  See \r\n  Watts v. Monarch Builders, Inc., 272 S.C. 517, 252 S.E.2d 889 (1979) \r\n  (holding that in the absence of fraud, the construction of a clear and unambiguous \r\n  contract is a matter of law).Â  If the membership agreement is construed to contain \r\n  an arbitration clause, whether McMillanâ€™s claims are subject to arbitration \r\n  is an â€œissue for judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.â€Â  \r\n  Zabinski v.

Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609, 571 S.E.2d 711, \r\n  713 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing U.S. v. Bankers Ins. Co., 245 F.3d 315, 319 \r\n  (4th Cir. 2001)); see also General Equip. &amp; Supp. Co. v.

App. 2001) (â€œ[T]he determination of whether a party waived its right to \r\n  arbitrate is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review.â€).Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if there is \r\n  any evidence reasonably supporting the findings.Â  Liberty Builders, Inc. \r\n  v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 664-65, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGold Kist argues the circuit court erred in finding McMillan \r\n  was not bound by the amendment of the bylaws, and thereby finding the arbitration \r\n  clause inapplicable to McMillan.Â  We agree and reverse.\r\nI. Validity \r\n  of Gold Kistâ€™s Arbitration Policy\r\nInitially, we note that South Carolina law generally favors \r\n  arbitration.Â  See Cox v. Woodmen of World Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 460, \r\n  464, 556 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 2001) (citingÂ  Heffner v. Destiny, Inc., \r\n  321 S.C. 536, 537, 471 S.E.2d 135, 136 (1995)).Â Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption \r\n  in favor of the validity of arbitration agreements because of the strong policy \r\n  favoring arbitration.â€Â  Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, \r\n  37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 843-44 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Amending Bylaws To Include an Arbitration Clause\r\nFirst, we consider whether Gold Kist could amend its \r\n  bylaws to include an arbitration policy.Â  Because Gold Kist is an agricultural \r\n  cooperative formed in Georgia, actions it may take are governed by the Georgia \r\n  Cooperative Marketing Act.Â  Section 2-10-86 of the Act requires a cooperative \r\n  to adopt bylaws within thirty days of incorporation.Â  Ga. Code Ann. Â§ 2-10-86 \r\n  (a) (Supp. 2001).Â  However, the section does not specifically list arbitration \r\n  clauses.Â  Georgia law also provides that â€œ[i]t is a general rule that a corporation \r\n  may enact any bylaw for its internal management so long as such bylaws are not \r\n  contrary to its charter, a controlling statute, its articles of incorporation, \r\n  or violative of any general law or public policy.â€Â  Booker v. First Federal \r\n  Sav. and Loan Assâ€™n, 110 S.E.2d 360, 362 (Ga. 1959).Â  \r\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals recently addressed \r\n  issues very similar to the present action in Rushing v. Gold Kist, Inc., \r\n  567 S.E.2d 384 (Ga. App. 2002).Â  There, Gold Kist and a collection company filed \r\n  a motion to compel Rushing, a farming cooperative member, to arbitrate based \r\n  on his default on a note.Â  As in the present case, the membership agreement \r\n  provided that Rushing agreed to be bound by future amendments to the bylaws, \r\n  and it was signed by Rushing several years before Gold Kist adopted the amendment \r\n  to the bylaws mandating arbitration.Â  Although Rushing argued the arbitration \r\n  clause was not binding upon him because he did not agree to it, the court held \r\n  Rushing agreed to be bound by future amendments to the bylaws when he signed \r\n  the membership agreement, thus agreeing to bind himself to arbitration.Â  Id. \r\n  at 387-88.Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with this result \r\n  [1]  and find the circuit court erred in determining that Gold Kistâ€™s arbitration \r\n  clause was not validly adopted into its bylaws. In making its determination, \r\n  the circuit court relied heavily on the fact that arbitration clauses are not \r\n  specifically listed under section 2-10-86(a) of the Georgia Code, which addresses \r\n  cooperativesâ€™ bylaws.Â  However, this silence also indicates that Georgia law \r\n  does not specifically forbid agricultural cooperatives from having arbitration \r\n  clauses in their bylaws or from amending their bylaws to include such clauses.Â  \r\n  Therefore, where, as here, the arbitration clause is not contrary to the cooperativeâ€™s \r\n  charter, its articles of incorporation, a controlling statute, or public policy, \r\n  the cooperative can amend its bylaws to include such a clause.Â  See Booker, \r\n  110 S.E.2d at 262. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Governing \r\n  Law\r\nNext, we address whether Gold Kistâ€™s arbitration clause is \r\n  governed by the requirements of the South Carolina Arbitration Act or the Federal \r\n  Arbitration Act.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Arbitration Act delineates specific \r\n  notice requirements for arbitration clauses.Â  The Act provides that â€œ[n]otice \r\n  that a contract is subject to arbitration pursuant to this chapter shall be \r\n  typed in underlined capital letters, or rubber-stamped prominently, on the first \r\n  page of the contract and unless such notice is displayed thereon the contract \r\n  shall not be subject to arbitration.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10 (a) (Supp. \r\n  2001).Â  This section is strictly construed and failure to comply with its terms \r\n  renders the arbitration clause unenforceable.Â  See Zabinski, 346 \r\n  S.C. at 588, 553 S.E.2d at 114 (finding that this section of the South Carolina \r\n  Arbitration Act must be strictly construed).\r\nHowever, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts \r\n  state arbitration law in some instances.Â  â€œUnless the parties have contracted \r\n  to the contrary, the FAA applies in federal or state court to any arbitration \r\n  agreement regarding a transaction that in fact involves interstate commerce, \r\n  regardless of whether or not the parties contemplated an interstate transaction.â€Â  \r\n  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 \r\n  (2001); Cox, 347 S.C. at 464, 556 S.E.2d at 400.Â  Section 2 of the FAA \r\n  provides that a written provision in a contract requiring parties to submit \r\n  to arbitration arising out of controversies surrounding the contract â€œshall \r\n  be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law \r\n  or in equity for the revocation of any contract.â€Â  9 U.S.C. Â§ 2.Â  Thus, the \r\n  FAA does not impose specific procedures regarding how notice of arbitration \r\n  must be given in contracts.\r\nThe parties do not dispute that the arbitration clause failed \r\n  to meet the technical requirements of South Carolina law in that the notice \r\n  of arbitration was not in bold letters or stamped on the first page of the contract.Â  \r\n  However, because evidence in the record shows that some of the stock for Gold \r\n  Kistâ€™s store came from Tennessee, [2]  interstate commerce was involved.Â  \r\n  Thus, the FAA, which does not require special fonts or lettering in the arbitration \r\n  clause, preempts state law in this instance.Â  \r\nWe therefore hold that Gold Kist was permitted to amend its \r\n  bylaws to include an arbitration clause and that the arbitration clause is valid \r\n  under the FAA.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Applicability of the Arbitration Agreement to McMillan\r\nFinally, we consider whether the arbitration clause \r\n  was binding upon McMillan.Â  As a condition of membership, McMillan agreed that \r\n  future amendments to the bylaws would be binding on him.Â  We find that this \r\n  agreement did in fact bind McMillan to the subsequent amendment requiring arbitration.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Davis v South Carolina Cotton Growersâ€™ Co-op. Assâ€™n, \r\n  127 S.C. 353, 358, 121 S.E. 260, 261 (1924) (finding that where bylaws allowed \r\n  the director to determine the voting procedures, a subsequent resolution regarding \r\n  voting procedures was thereafter binding on all members); 18 Am.Jur.2d Cooperative \r\n  Associations Â§ 14 (1985) (â€œA member of a cooperative association may enter \r\n  into a contract to be bound by articles, bylaws, rules, and regulations of the \r\n  association theretofore or thereafter passed by the association . . . [and it \r\n  is] binding upon the association and its members.â€).Â  Although McMillan did \r\n  not specifically consent to the adoption of the arbitration policy into the \r\n  bylaws, his agreement in his membership application to confer the power to amend \r\n  bylaws upon the directors amounted to consent to the amendment and did not affect \r\n  the substance of his contract with Gold Kist.Â  See Rushing, 567 \r\n  S.E.2d at 387-88.Â  Further, although there is no evidence in the record that \r\n  McMillan was given actual notice of the amendment of the bylaws to include an \r\n  arbitration policy, he is still bound by the amendment because it did not affect \r\n  the validity of his contract with Gold Kist.Â  Roach v. Farmersâ€™ Mut. Ins. \r\n  Assâ€™n of Oconee Co., 102 S.C. 478, 481, 86 S.E. 950, 952 (1915) (stating \r\n  that a member is bound by amendments to or changes in the bylaws even if the \r\n  member had no notice of the changes except when the amendments affect the terms \r\n  of the contract). \r\nMcMillanâ€™s membership contract with Gold Kist provided, \r\n  in part, that he would provide agricultural products to Gold Kist for marketing \r\n  purposes and that he would purchase equipment or fertilizer from Gold Kist.Â  \r\n  The terms of this contract were not affected by the subsequent adoption of the \r\n  arbitration clause.Â  Since arbitration is favored, we find the circuit court \r\n  erred in holding Gold Kistâ€™s arbitration policy was not applicable to McMillan.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding the arbitration policy was not binding on McMillan, we REVERSE.\r\nCURETON and ANDERSON, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Whether or not Georgia law allows cooperatives \r\n    to amend their bylaws to include an arbitration policy was not precisely argued \r\n    in Rushing; however, the caseâ€™s holding implies that such amendments \r\n    are valid.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  McMillan argues Gold Kist failed to establish that the lime originated \r\n    outside the state because the affidavit attached to Gold Kistâ€™s motion to \r\n    compel arbitration only alleged that the lime â€œwould have originated in Tennesseeâ€; \r\n    it did not allege the lime did originate in Tennessee.Â  However, the \r\n    affidavit also states that Gold Kistâ€™s store in Allendale, South Carolina, \r\n    â€œsold . . . farm production supplies to local farmers, which were delivered \r\n    to the facility from out of state, either by tractor trailer or by rail.â€Â  \r\n    Therefore, we find the affidavit sufficiently establishes that the transaction \r\n    between McMillan and Gold Kist involved interstate commerce.Â  See generally \r\n    Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 263 (7th ed. 1999) (defining interstate commerce as \r\n    â€œ[t]rade and other business activities between those located in different \r\n    statesâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3594","title":"South Carolina Second Injury Fund v.

Johnson, III, of Columbia, \r\n          for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSHULER, J.: \r\n  In this workers' compensation case, the South Carolina Second Injury Fund appeals \r\n  from a circuit court order affirming the full commission's finding that Liberty \r\n  Mutual Insurance Company was entitled to reimbursement for death benefits paid \r\n  to the estate of Gilford R. Etheredge. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn May 1994, Gasque Farms owned and \r\n  operated approximately 2,700 acres of farmland in and around Elloree, South \r\n  Carolina. At the time, the business employed 62-year-old Gilford Etheredge to \r\n  assist in managing its farming operations. Etheredge's usual duties included \r\n  running errands, carrying fuel and dinner to field hands, and other similar \r\n  tasks. Etheredge, however, normally did not operate farm equipment.\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1994, Gasque Farms employees \r\n  intentionally set fire to a 104- acre cut-over wheatfield. Although the burning \r\n  of cut-over fields was standard practice, in this instance the fire blazed out \r\n  of control. Shortly after noon, the fire jumped across a ditch and highway and \r\n  began consuming a 55-acre field of unharvested wheat.\r\n\r\nManager Everett Gasque enlisted Etheredge \r\n  to assist in controlling highway traffic affected by the heavy smoke. Gasque \r\n  also sent Etheredge to retrieve a chainsaw to be used in containing the fire; \r\n  Etheredge made two trips but returned with non-operational saws on both occasions. \r\n  After a reprimand from Gasque, Etheredge spent the better part of the afternoon \r\n  dealing with the fire and its aftermath. At approximately 5:30 p.m., he climbed \r\n  into the cab of the farm pickup truck. As he cranked the engine, Etheredge suffered \r\n  a fatal heart attack and the truck rolled down an embankment and into a nearby \r\n  ditch. \r\n\r\n Etheredge's widow filed a claim against \r\n  Gasque Farms for workers' compensation death benefits. Liberty Mutual Insurance \r\n  Company, Gasque Farms' compensation carrier, accepted the claim and paid benefits \r\n  to Etheredge's estate. Liberty subsequently sought reimbursement from the South \r\n  Carolina Second Injury Fund. The Fund denied Liberty's reimbursement claim and \r\n  Liberty requested a hearing before the workers' compensation commission. \r\n\r\nFollowing a hearing in December 1999, \r\n  the single commissioner found Etheredge did not suffer an injury by accident \r\n  arising out of and in the course of his employment and therefore agreed with \r\n  the Fund that Liberty was not entitled to compensation pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(a) (1985). In addition, the commissioner noted the evidence \r\n  was insufficient to establish Gasque Farms' knowledge of Etheredge's preexisting \r\n  physical impairment as required by subsection (c) of the statute. \r\n\r\nLiberty appealed and the full commission \r\n  reversed. By order dated August 15, 2000, the commission held Etheredge's fatal \r\n  heart attack was a compensible accident caused by unusual and extraordinary \r\n  circumstances in his employment. The commission further concluded the knowledge \r\n  prerequisite of Â§ 42-9-400(c) was satisfied because Etheredge never knew he \r\n  had a heart condition. Finding the company met the conditions for reimbursement, \r\n  the commission ordered the Fund to reimburse Liberty, pursuant to Â§ 42-9-400(a), \r\n  for all aspects of the claim arising out of Etheredge's death.\r\n\r\nThe Fund petitioned the circuit court \r\n  for review. Following a hearing on January 3, 2001, the circuit court issued \r\n  an order affirming the full commission. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nStandard of Review \r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  establishes the applicable standard of review for decisions of the workers' \r\n  compensation commission. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); \r\n  Adkins v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 350 S.C. 34, 564 S.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\n  Pursuant to the Act, an appellate court\r\n\r\n\"shall not substitute its judgment \r\n  for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (1986). Thus, in reviewing a commission decision, \r\n  this Court will not overturn factual findings unless \"clearly erroneous in view \r\n  of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.\" Id. \r\n  at Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e); see Adams v. Texfi Indus., 341 S.C. 401, 404, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  124, 125 (2000). \"Substantial evidence\" is evidence which, considering the entire \r\n  record, would allow reasonable minds to arrive at the same conclusion reached \r\n  by the administrative agency. See Adams, 341 S.C. at 404, 535 S.E.2d at 125; \r\n  Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Second Injury Fund \r\n  is intended to \"encourage the employment of disabled or handicapped persons \r\n  without penalizing an employer with greater liability if the employee is injured \r\n  because of his preexisting condition.\" Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina \r\n  Second Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 516, 518, 458 S.E.2d 550, 551 (1995). Reimbursement \r\n  from the Fund is governed by section 42-9-400, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If an employee who has a permanent \r\n    physical impairment . . . incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident \r\n    arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in compensation \r\n    . . . for disability that is substantially greater, by reason of the combined \r\n    effects of the preexisting impairment and subsequent injury . . . than that \r\n    which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone . . . [the employee's] \r\n    employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the Second Injury \r\n    Fund . . . . \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400(a) (1985). \r\n  The statute also contains a \"knowledge\" provision that requires an employer \r\n  seeking reimbursement to demonstrate it either knew of the employee's preexisting \r\n  permanent physical impairment or did not know because the employee concealed \r\n  the condition or was unaware of it himself. Id. at Â§ 42-9-400(c).\r\n\r\nThe Fund first argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in affirming the commission's determination that Etheredge had a \r\n  preexisting permanent physical impairment as defined in Â§ 42-9-400(d). This \r\n  issue is not preserved. \r\n\r\nThe Fund's petition for review listed \r\n  forty-nine exceptions to the decision of the full commission. Although the transcript \r\n  from the hearing before the circuit court reveals the Fund challenged the commission's \r\n  finding that Etheredge's preexisting heart condition was a permanent physical \r\n  impairment as defined in Â§ 42-9-400(d), the circuit court's order fails to address \r\n  the issue. As the Fund did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion requesting a \r\n  ruling, the issue is not preserved for appellate review. See Shealy v. Aiken \r\n  County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000) (affirming court of appeals' conclusion \r\n  that issue that had been raised to but not ruled upon by the trial court was \r\n  not preserved for review where the appellant failed to make a Rule 59(e) motion \r\n  to alter or amend the judgment); Fraternal Order of Police v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Revenue, 332 S.C. 496, 501, 506 S.E.2d 495, 497 (1998) (finding argument \r\n  on appeal not preserved even where raised to the circuit court because \"that \r\n  court failed to rule on the issue and [appellants] failed to call this omission \r\n  to the circuit court's attention in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion\").\r\n\r\nThe Fund next asserts the circuit \r\n  court erred in affirming the commission's conclusion that Etheredge had no prior \r\n  knowledge of his heart condition. We disagree. \r\n\r\nAt autopsy, Dr. Joel Sexton determined \r\n  Etheredge had severe coronary atherosclerosis and concluded Etheredge died from \r\n  acute coronary insufficiency, i.e., a heart attack, as a result. In deposition \r\n  testimony, Etheredge's wife of thirty-four years, Connie, stated neither she \r\n  nor Etheredge was aware of any significant health problems prior to the heart \r\n  attack. She further testified Etheredge did not have high blood pressure, and \r\n  related that a physical examination by his personal physician in December 1993 \r\n  revealed no health problems other than a usual admonition for Etheredge to watch \r\n  his weight.\r\n\r\nAlthough Connie testified her husband \r\n  complained of chest pain the evening before he died, she stated he told her \r\n  it was \"like when you fell out of the tub . . . like a pulled muscle or something \r\n  . . . a bad rib.\" Etheredge advised Connie he thought the pain stemmed from \r\n  a job repairing an irrigation pump because the other employee with whom he had \r\n  been working \"complained about the same thing.\" In testimony before the commission, \r\n  farm manager Everett Gasque also averred he was unaware Etheredge, whom he had \r\n  employed for seven years, had any heart problems prior to the fatal attack. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Fund presented no evidence contradicting \r\n  either Gasque or Connie Etheredge's testimony and the obvious conclusion that \r\n  Etheredge was unaware of his coronary problems. We therefore agree with the \r\n  circuit court that the evidence presented would allow a reasonable mind to reach \r\n  the same result as the commission on this issue. \r\n\r\nThe Fund further contends the circuit \r\n  court erred in affirming the commission's finding that Etheredge's employment \r\n  conditions on May 24, 1994 were unusual or extraordinary. We discern no error. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAn employee who becomes sick or dies \r\n  of natural causes on the job \"does not suffer an accident arising out of employment \r\n  because the condition is a natural result or consequence that might be termed \r\n  normal and to be expected.\" Jennings v. Chambers Dev. Co., 335 S.C. 249, 255, \r\n  516 S.E.2d 453, 456 (Ct. App. 1999). However, an employee who dies of a heart \r\n  attack or other vascular injury while working may be entitled to workers' compensation \r\n  benefits if it is shown \"the death arose out of employment, in that it was brought \r\n  about by unexpected strain or over-exertion, or as a result of unusual and extraordinary \r\n  conditions of employment.\" Id.; see Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. \r\n  511, 520, 544 S.E.2d 842, 847 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating a claimant must prove \r\n  a heart attack was induced by unexpected strain or by unusual and extraordinary \r\n  conditions or there is no injury by accident). Although the record here discloses \r\n  that, for the most part, Etheredge's job involved running errands and otherwise \r\n  assisting in general farm management, it also reveals that the events of May \r\n  24, 1994 turned what was a usual task for farm employees--the burning of harvested \r\n  fields--into the extraordinary task of managing an out-of-control fire threatening \r\n  fifty-five acres of unharvested wheat.\r\n\r\nAs noted by the full commission and \r\n  circuit court, Etheredge spent several hours that afternoon helping contain \r\n  the fire and its effects. The fire was extinguished but revived on three separate \r\n  occasions. Gasque twice sent Etheredge for a chain saw to cut away dead trees; \r\n  when Etheredge retrieved non-operational saws both times, Gasque raised his \r\n  voice and cursed him. According to Gasque's testimony before the commission, \r\n  the whole area was \"very smokey\" [sic] and everyone working, including Etheredge, \r\n  was subjected to \"a good bit of smoke all day.\" Gasque explained that despite \r\n  being about fifty yards away at the time Etheredge's truck went into the ditch, \r\n  \"there was so much smoke there I could not see.\" \r\n\r\nAll told, Gasque related it had been \r\n  a stressful day for him and appeared stressful to others as well. He stated \r\n  he had experienced only one other similar fire in forty years of farming and \r\n  that he would \"never forget it.\" Based on this testimony and evidence indicating \r\n  an abnormally stressful work environment on May 24, we affirm the circuit court \r\n  decision holding substantial evidence supports the full commission's determination \r\n  of unusual or extraordinary employment conditions. See Brown v. La France Indus., \r\n  286 S.C. 319, 333 S.E.2d 348 (Ct. App. 1985); Poulos by Poulos v. Pete's Drive-In \r\n  No. 3, 284 S.C. 264, 325 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\nLastly, the Fund argues it was error \r\n  for the circuit court to affirm the commission's conclusion that these conditions \r\n  caused Etheredge's fatal heart attack. We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe requisite showing for compensability \r\n  in heart attack cases consists of two distinct parts--medical and legal--each \r\n  of which relates to causation. See 2 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's \r\n  Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 46.03[1] (2002). In general, the legal component \r\n  is established when the law defines what type of exertion or circumstance of \r\n  employment satisfies the \"arising out of\" test, while the required medical showing \r\n  resolves the question of whether the exertion or particular circumstance in \r\n  fact caused the injury. Id. \r\n\r\nSuccessful claimants must satisfy \r\n  both. See Shealy, 341 S.C. at 459, 535 S.E.2d at 444 (applying the \"heart attack \r\n  standard\" to mental-mental injuries and holding that \"[i]n order for Shealy \r\n  to recover workers' compensation benefits, he must prove both: (1) \r\n  that he was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in his employment; \r\n  and (2) that these unusual and extraordinary conditions were the proximate \r\n  cause of his mental breakdown\") (emphasis added); Moore v. City of Easley, 322 \r\n  S.C. 455, 462, 472 S.E.2d 626, 630 (1996) (&quot;[A]ngina is compensable only \r\n  to the extent that it causes disability and arises out of extreme or \r\n  unusual work circumstances.\"); Owings v. Anderson County Sheriff's Dep't, 315 \r\n  S.C. 297, 433 S.E.2d 869 (1993) (stating that where substantial evidence supported \r\n  finding claimant's heart problems were not causally related to his employment \r\n  activities, there was no error in concluding the injury did not arise out of \r\n  his admittedly physically demanding job training).\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the record must evince \r\n  a causal connection between any extreme exertion or extraordinary or unusual \r\n  conditions of employment and a claimant's heart-related injury or death. See \r\n  Lorick v. SCE&amp;G, 245 S.C. 513, 518, 141 S.E.2d 662, 664 (1965) (\"The mere \r\n  fact of death during employment is not a basis for an award. The death must \r\n  be proximately caused by an accident that arose out of the employment[,] and \r\n  the burden is on the claimant to establish such fact.\"). The burden lies with \r\n  the claimant to demonstrate causation by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. \r\n  Whether any causal connection exists between a claimant's employment and an \r\n  injury is a question of fact for the single commissioner or full commission. \r\n  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Fund contends \"[t]here \r\n  is no evidence that anything done . . . or experienced by [Etheredge] brought \r\n  about his death.\" A close inspection of the Fund's brief, however, reveals the \r\n  crux of its argument to be the lack of direct evidence, either testimonial \r\n  or documentary, lay or medical, connecting Etheredge's heart attack to the unusual \r\n  conditions of his employment on the afternoon of the fire. This argument is \r\n  misplaced.\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that evidence tending \r\n  to establish causation may be circumstantial or inferential in nature. As our \r\n  supreme court long ago stated: \r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Proof that the claimant sustained \r\n    an injury and that it arose out of and in the course of employment may be \r\n    established by circumstantial as well as by direct evidence where the circumstances \r\n    surrounding the occurrence of the injury are such as to lead an unprejudiced \r\n    mind reasonably to infer that it was caused by [the] accident . . . .\" \r\n\r\n\r\nHewitt v.

He had performed \r\n    those tasks, on a regular basis, without difficulty for some seven years, \r\n    notwithstanding his severe coronary disease. The duties that [he] was performing \r\n    on the afternoon of his death were clearly different. . . . Mr. Etheredge \r\n    was found dead as a result of a heart attack after a long afternoon of dealing \r\n    with the fire. Considering all of the evidence, including the evidence of \r\n    his pre-existing severe coronary artery disease, we find that the evidence \r\n    establishe[s] a causal connection between the unusual and extraordinary circumstances \r\n    in the employment and the fatal heart attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause substantial record evidence \r\n  supports this conclusion, we find no error. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., \r\n  concur.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
