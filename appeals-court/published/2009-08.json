Bannister, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Â William\r\n  Harris appeals from the master-in-equity's final order of dissolution of a\r\n  partnership, arguing the master erred in: (1) finding the separation agreements\r\n  were ambiguous; and (2) if the agreements were ambiguous, interpreting them to\r\n  include the health insurance claims and attorneys' fees as liabilities of all\r\n  three parties because they were not specifically included in the parties'\r\n  agreement.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  December 1997, Harris, Steven Ivester, and Michael Surprenant incorporated\r\n  Ideal Solutions, Inc. and Carolina Pay, Inc.[1]Â \r\n  Ideal Solutions provided its customers with employees and services, including\r\n  health insurance and workers' compensation insurance.Â  Carolina Pay provided\r\n  only payroll services to its customers.Â  Ideal Solutions used a broker to\r\n  acquire health insurance for its customers; however, it was discovered in\r\n  December 2001 that the insurance company chosen by the broker was fraudulent.Â \r\n  By the time Ideal Solutions learned of the sham, claims of covered employees\r\n  had not been paid.Â  Ideal Solutions also had similar problems with its workers'\r\n  compensation insurance.Â  The unpaid employee claims from the thirteen-month\r\n  period when Ideal Solutions did not have health insurance coverage were\r\n  potential liabilities of Ideal Solutions and its three partners.Â  Ideal\r\n  Solutions hired attorneys to sue the responsible parties and to defend it\r\n  against claims from employees for unpaid health insurance claims.\r\nIn February 2004, the parties discussed ending their business relationship\r\n  and signed a separation agreement on March 30, 2004.Â  The March 30, 2004\r\n  agreement divided the assets of Ideal Solutions into thirds, including its\r\n  customer lists.Â  After the division of the assets and liabilities, Ivester and Surprenant\r\n  decided to remain partners.Â  All three partners agreed Harris was to receive\r\n  $8,476 less than their assets for leaving the partnership.Â  Following the\r\n  agreement, the parties continued to negotiate and signed a new agreement\r\n  on April 30, 2004.[2]Â \r\n  After the April 30, 2004 agreement was signed, additional health care and\r\n  workers' compensation claims were filed against Ideal Solutions.Â  All of the\r\n  claims arose from the incidents which occurred more than two years prior to the\r\n  April 30, 2004 agreement.Â  However, the parties disagreed about the\r\n  interpretation of the April 30, 2004 agreement as it related to the health\r\n  insurance and workers' compensation insurance claims.Â  Harris claimed the April\r\n  30, 2004 agreement excused him from any responsibility for any claims that were\r\n  unknown at the time the agreement was executed.Â  Ivester and Surprenant\r\n  contended the agreement included the newly-filed claims.\r\nHarris filed a complaint against Ivester and Surprenant in circuit\r\n  court on January 15, 2005; however, by agreement, the parties waived a jury\r\n  trial and referred the matter to the master with leave to appeal directly to\r\n  the Court of Appeals.Â  The parties referred the matter to the master for the\r\n  purposes of dissolving the joint business entity on partnership principles;\r\n  conducting an accounting as to assets, liabilities, and interpreting the\r\n  agreement of the parties as to the dissolution of the business relationship.Â  The\r\n  master found the April 30, 2004 agreement to be ambiguous and allowed parol\r\n  evidence to determine the parties' intent.Â  In the final order of dissolution,\r\n  the master held the agreement included the health care claims that arose prior\r\n  to April 30, 2004, but became known after April 30, 2004.[3]Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nAn action to\r\n  construe a contract is an action at law. Â Pruitt v. S.C. Med. Malpractice\r\n    Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845\r\n  (2001). Â &quot;In an action at law, tried without a jury, the trial court's\r\n  findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence\r\n  which reasonably supports the court's findings.&quot; Â Stanley v. Atl. Title\r\n    Ins. Co., 377 S.C. 405, 409, 661 S.E.2d 62, 64 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Separation Agreements\r\nHarris\r\n  argues the master erred in finding the separation agreements were ambiguous.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The cardinal\r\n  rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the\r\n  parties' intentions as determined by the contract language.&quot;Â  McGill v.\r\n    Moore, 381 S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009) (quoting Schulmeyer\r\n      v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134\r\n  (2003)).Â  A contract must be read as a whole document so that ambiguity is not\r\n  created by a single sentence or clause.Â  Id.Â  Whether the contract is\r\n  ambiguous is a question of law for the court.Â  Id.Â  &quot;A contract is\r\n  ambiguous when the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible to more\r\n  than one interpretation.&quot;Â  Pee Dee Stores, Inc. v. Doyle, 381 S.C.\r\n  234, 242, 672 S.E.2d 799, 803 (Ct. App. 2009) (quoting S.C. Dep't of Natural\r\n    Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302\r\n  (2001)).Â  If an agreement is found to be ambiguous, the court should seek to\r\n  determine the parties' intent.Â  Ward v. West Oil Co., 379 S.C. 225, 239,\r\n  665 S.E.2d 618, 626 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;[W]hen the written contract is\r\n  ambiguous in its terms, . . . parol and other extrinsic evidence will be\r\n  admitted to determine the intent of the parties.&quot;Â  Charles v. B &amp; B\r\n    Theatres, Inc., 234 S.C. 15, 18, 106 S.E.2d 455, 456 (1959).\r\nHarris\r\n  argues the three agreements made between the parties should be construed as one\r\n  contract and considered as a whole to determine the parties' intentions.[4]Â Â \r\n  &quot;The general rule is that, in the absence of anything indicating a\r\n  contrary intention, where instruments are executed at the same time, by the\r\n  same parties, for the same purpose, and in the course of the same transaction,\r\n  the Court will consider and construe them together.&quot;Â  Cafe Assocs. v.\r\n    Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 10, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991).Â  In Cafe\r\n      Associates, the Court found the master did not err in reading the Asset\r\n  Purchase Agreement and the Covenant Not to Compete together because the two\r\n  agreements were substantially the same, covered the same subject matter, and\r\n  were executed during the course of the same transaction by the same parties for\r\n  the same purpose.Â  Id. at 10, 406 S.E.2d at 164-65.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  however, the two March 30, 2004 agreements were signed before Ivester and Surprenant\r\n  decided to remain partners.Â  Thus, the situation had changed when the April 30,\r\n  2004 agreement was signed.Â  As a result, the three agreements were not executed\r\n  during the course of the same transaction for the same purpose.Â  Thus, the\r\n  March 30, 2004 agreements should not be construed as the same agreement as the\r\n  April 30, 2004 agreement.\r\nHarris\r\n  argues the language of the April 30, 2004 agreement established that no new\r\n  expenses or liabilities were to be incurred unless they were specifically\r\n  agreed to by the parties and there was no evidence Harris agreed to accept\r\n  liability for health claims or attendant attorneys' fees after April 30, 2004.Â \r\n  Harris asserts the agreement provided that Ivester and Surprenant were to be\r\n  responsible for all expenses arising after April 30, 2004, including the new\r\n  health claims.Â  He also maintains item number nine under the expenses and\r\n  liabilities section of the April 30, 2004 agreement should not be read to\r\n  include the claims from the insurance company fraud that happened more than two\r\n  years prior to the signing of the agreement.Â  Harris testified his goal when\r\n  drafting the agreement was &quot;to make sure that we all documented what we\r\n  needed to document here right upfront before I left&quot; and that all the\r\n  assets and liabilities were identified.Â  He also testified it was his\r\n  understanding that the errors and omissions insurance would take care of all\r\n  the health insurance claims that were pending in April 2004.\r\nIvester\r\n  and Surprenant argue the later-filed health claims were a liability that\r\n  existed prior to the April 30, 2004 agreement; thus, they were implicitly\r\n  included in the agreement.Â  They argue they did not specifically include the\r\n  health claims in the April 30, 2004 agreement because they did not know how\r\n  much the claims were going to be.Â  Also, Ivester testified they did not include\r\n  them in the agreement because &quot;[a]t that time [they] really thought that\r\n  [they] would be able to get awards from Mr. Brown and other people by bringing\r\n  lawsuits against them to pay for anything that would come up.&quot;Â Â Â  However,\r\n  the agreement specifically includes workers' compensation claim payments even\r\n  though Ivester testified they did not know at that time exactly how much they\r\n  were going to have to pay.Â  They also included &quot;nominal&quot; attorneys'\r\n  fees for the health insurance claims.Â  Additionally, various other income and\r\n  expenses that they did not know the exact amount of were included in the\r\n  agreement.Â  Ivester testified there were no new agreements signed by Harris\r\n  after the April 30, 2004 agreement.\r\nSurprenant testified Harris knew there\r\n  were pending health care claims, and the partners would be personally liable if\r\n  they were not covered by the insurance.Â  Thus, he argues the health care claims\r\n  were a known liability at the time the April 30, 2004 agreement was signed.Â  He\r\n  further testified the partners had discussions about the future health claims,\r\n  and they all agreed they would continue to pay them as they had paid them in\r\n  the past.Â  Surprenant testified item\r\n  number nine of the expenses and liabilities section of the April 30, 2004\r\n  agreement covered any\r\n  mistakes created prior to the split up of the partners and those would be\r\n  liabilities of the partnership.Â  He also testified item number nine included\r\n  the pending health care claims.Â  \r\nDaniel Livengood, who was Ideal Solutions' accountant and was\r\n  involved in the agreement negotiations, testified that during one of the meetings,\r\n  he was told that item number nine under the expense and liability section of\r\n  the April 30, 2004 agreement was to be viewed &quot;as a catchall for other\r\n  items that might occur after . . . May 1st, but be tied back to having accrued\r\n  prior to that time.&quot;Â  Livengood testified that purchasing fraudulent\r\n  health insurance was a mistake that would fall under this category, and thus,\r\n  the April 30, 2004 agreement included the pending health care claims.Â  He also\r\n  testified all three partners discussed the contingent claims from the health\r\n  care fraud and the attorneys' fees were a contingent liability because they\r\n  resulted from actions that were taken prior to April 30, 2004.Â  He further\r\n  testified the health care claims were paid by Ideal Solutions prior to the\r\n  April 30, 2004 agreement.\r\nThe\r\n  master found the April 30, 2004 agreement was ambiguous and admitted parol\r\n  evidence to determine the intent of the parties concerning the health care\r\n  claims filed after the date of the agreement.Â  The master found Livengood's\r\n  testimony was &quot;determinative of the intention of the partners to their\r\n  agreement as to whether [the health care] claims were to be included as a\r\n  liability under item [nine], &quot;Expenses/Liability.&quot;Â  The master\r\n  further found Harris's interpretation of the agreement would lead to an absurd\r\n  result because he would share with his partners the awards from lawsuits filed\r\n  for health insurance problems, but would not be responsible for health care\r\n  claims that were filed after April 30, 2004.Â  Therefore, the testimony supports\r\n  the master's finding that the parties intended for the later-filed health care\r\n  claims to be included in the agreement as a liability of the partners.Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Liabilities\r\nHarris\r\n  argues that if the agreements were ambiguous, the master erred in including the health insurance claims and attendant\r\n  attorneys' fees as liabilities of all three parties because they were not\r\n  specifically included in the parties' agreement.Â  We disagree.[5]\r\nHarris\r\n  argues the April 30, 2004 agreement covered the issues regarding the health\r\n  insurance fraud and he was not responsible for expenses and liabilities that\r\n  arose after April 30, 2004.Â  Specifically, he argues the agreement mentioned\r\n  the health insurance claims and the attorneys' fees related to them, but did\r\n  not state he was liable for them.Â  Also, the agreement included workers'\r\n  compensation claim payments, but did not mention the health insurance claims\r\n  that resulted from the same event.Â  Thus, Harris asserts Ivester and\r\n  Surprenant's failure to include the health insurance claims and attorneys' fees\r\n  in the April 30, 2004 agreement bars them from now holding him partially\r\n  responsible because the new claims arose after the agreement was signed.\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, Ivester and Surprenant assert the health care claims were not\r\n  specifically included in the April 30, 2004 agreement because they were an old\r\n  liability, and thus, they were implicitly included in the agreement.Â  Surprenant testified item number nine under the expenses and liabilities\r\n  section of the April 30, 2004 agreement covered any mistakes created prior to the split up of the\r\n  partners and those would be liabilities of the partnership.Â  He also testified\r\n  item number nine included the pending health care claims.Â  He further testified\r\n  the partners had discussions about the future health claims and they all agreed\r\n  they would continue to pay them as they had been.\r\nAdditionally, Livengood testified item number nine was a catchall\r\n  for other items that might occur after the agreement was signed, but had\r\n  accrued prior to that time.Â  He also testified that purchasing fraudulent\r\n  health insurance was a mistake that would fall under this category, and thus,\r\n  the April 30, 2004 agreement included the pending health care claims.Â  He\r\n  further testified all three partners discussed that the health care fraud and\r\n  attorneys' fees were a contingent liability because they resulted from actions\r\n  that were taken prior to April 30, 2004.Â  Therefore, the evidence supports the\r\n  master's finding that Harris was responsible\r\n  for health insurance claims and attendant attorneys' fees that arose after\r\n  April 30, 2004.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the master's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although the business was incorporated, the parties ran it as a partnership. \r\n[2]Â  The\r\n  April 30, 2004 agreement stated: &quot;All revenue and expenses incurred after\r\n  April 30, 2004 will be the responsibility of Steven A. Ivester and Michael G.\r\n  Surprenant with the following exceptions . . . .&quot;Â  Under the section\r\n  titled &quot;Income/Revenue,&quot; item number ten stated, &quot;Awards from\r\n  law suites [sic] filed for Health Insurance problems.&quot;Â  The agreement also\r\n  excluded ten items under the section titled &quot;Expenses/Liabilities.&quot;Â \r\n  Only four of the ten items are pertinent to this appeal:Â  \r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Nominal attorney fees\r\n  . . . for pursuing E&amp;O [errors and omissions] coverage related to previous Health\r\n  problems\r\n\t2.&nbsp; Workers Comp claim\r\n  payments, if needed, to ISI [Ideal Solutions, Inc.] employers while ISI was\r\n  self-insured\r\n\t. . . \r\n\t9.&nbsp; Expenses related to\r\n  correcting mistakes and day to day client activities for clients prior to May\r\n  1, 2004 \r\n\t10.&nbsp; Any other expenses/liabilities\r\n  as agreed to by all partners\r\n\tAll partners must approve any expenses or liabilities after April\r\n  30, 2004 in writing.\r\n\r\n[3] The master's order also ordered that Harris\r\n  &quot;immediately pay to the partnership the $48,636.75 he has withheld, and\r\n  such payment shall be made immediately on the filing and service of this\r\n  Order.&quot;Â  Harris did not appeal this amount.Â  \r\n[4] The other two agreements Harris refers to are the two\r\n  March 30, 2004 separation agreements, one for Ideal Solutions and one for Carolina\r\n  Pay.Â  \r\n[5] This issue addresses Harris's second and third issue.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4604","title":"State v.

Hodge, Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:Â  Ricky L.\r\n  Hatcher appeals his conviction and sentence for distribution of crack cocaine\r\n  and distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a park.Â  He argues the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting drug evidence for which the State failed to\r\n  prove the chain of custody and in misstating to the jury the State's burden of\r\n  proof.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  October 6, 2006, a confidential police informant purchased forty dollars' worth\r\n  of crack cocaine from Hatcher.Â  Two police officers followed the informant and\r\n  maintained visual contact with him as he traveled to meet Hatcher.Â  The\r\n  informant wore a concealed microphone and made the purchase with money the\r\n  police provided.Â  The drugs were tied up in two small plastic baggies, which the\r\n  informant concealed in his mouth before leaving Hatcher's home.[1]Â \r\n  Maintaining one-way radio contact with police, the informant left Hatcher's\r\n  home by a different route than he had arrived, met his police contacts, and\r\n  delivered the drugs to them.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Jeffrey Locklear accepted the drugs from the informant, placed the baggies in a\r\n  plastic evidence bag, sealed the bag, and wrote certain identifying information\r\n  on it.Â  At trial, Officer Locklear testified he placed the evidence bag in a\r\n  &quot;BEST kit&quot; plastic bag for processing by the State Law Enforcement\r\n  Division (SLED).Â  Officer Locklear transported the BEST kit to SLED.Â  Agent\r\n  Marjorie Wilson, a SLED chemist, testified she received the BEST kit from\r\n  SLED's Log-In Department, processed the drugs, and returned them in a newly\r\n  sealed bag to SLED's Log-In Department.Â  Officer Locklear testified the\r\n  evidence was returned to him in a heat-sealed bag that he brought to trial.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Hatcher objected to the admission of the drugs into evidence because the\r\n  State failed to establish a complete chain of custody.Â  The trial court\r\n  overruled Hatcher's objection, noting the drugs remained sealed in the bags\r\n  identified by the witnesses and a substantial chain of custody was established.Â \r\n  The jury convicted Hatcher of both offenses and the trial court sentenced him\r\n  to fifteen years' imprisonment on each count to run concurrently.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of evidence is\r\n  addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Williams,\r\n  297 S.C. 290, 293, 376 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1989).Â  &quot;On appeal, the question\r\n  presented is whether the trial court's decision is controlled by an error of\r\n  law or is without evidentiary support.&quot;Â  State v. Taylor, 360 S.C.\r\n  18, 23, 598 S.E.2d 735, 737 (Ct. App. 2004). Â If any evidence supports the\r\n  trial court's decision, the appellate courts will affirm it.Â  Id.\r\nI.&nbsp; Chain\r\n  of Custody\r\n&nbsp;Hatcher\r\n  contends the trial court erred in admitting the drug evidence when the State\r\n  failed to establish a complete chain of custody.Â  We agree. \r\n&quot;[A] party offering into evidence\r\n  fungible items such as drugs or blood samples must establish a complete chain\r\n  of custody as far as practicable.&quot; State v. Sweet, 374 S.C. 1, 6,\r\n  647 S.E.2d 202, 205 (2007).Â  When &quot;the substance\r\n  analyzed has passed through several hands the evidence must not leave it to\r\n  conjecture as to who had it and what was done with it between the taking and\r\n  the analysis.&quot;Â  Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 33-34, 100\r\n  S.E.2d 534, 537 (1957) (quoting Rodgers v. Commonwealth, 90 S.E.2d 257,\r\n  260 (Va. 1955)).Â  However, each person who handled\r\n  the evidence is not required to testify.Â  Sweet, 374 S.C. at 7,\r\n  647 S.E.2d at 206.[2]Â  When &quot;other\r\n  evidence establishes the identity of those who have handled the evidence and\r\n  reasonably demonstrates the manner of handling of the evidence, our courts have\r\n  been willing to fill gaps in the chain of custody due to an absent\r\n  witness.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Nevertheless, evidence is inadmissible under this\r\n  rule when the offering party omitted a link in the chain of possession by\r\n  failing to establish the identity of each custodian at least as far as\r\n  practicable.Â  State v. Governor, 362 S.C. 609, 612, 608 S.E.2d 474, 475\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005). Â \r\nFirst, the State argues Hatcher's\r\n  objection at trial does not specifically mention the whereabouts of the drugs\r\n  during the 276-day period between the purchase and the analysis, a matter he\r\n  now complains of on appeal. Â However, we believe his objection was sufficiently\r\n  specific to identify the grounds for the trial court.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;[A]n\r\n  objection must be sufficiently specific to inform the trial court of the point\r\n  being urged by the objector.&quot;).Â  Hatcher objected:Â  \r\n\r\n\tYour Honor, I have not heard any\r\n  testimony about where the drugs were located in-between the alleged buy on\r\n  October the 6th, 2006, and when it was transported to SLED.Â  I don't know where\r\n  it was kept.Â  I have not heard anything about where at SLED â€“ Ms. â€“ Ms. Wilson\r\n  says that she got it from Log-In, she analyzed it, she took it back to Log-In.Â \r\n  I don't think there's really been a complete chain of custody here, and I would\r\n  object to the drugs being entered into as evidence.Â  \r\n\r\nHatcher's\r\n  point was the State failed to establish each link in its chain of custody.Â  The\r\n  trial court clearly understood this point and ruled:Â  &quot;[I]n my view, based\r\n  on recent cases, that is sufficient.Â  You don't have to have every dot and\r\n  cross every 'T', but there is a substantial chain here that would justify my\r\n  admitting it into evidence.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nHaving determined the issue was\r\n  adequately preserved, we now turn to the merits.Â  Officer Locklear and Agent\r\n  Wilson both acted as custodians of the evidence.Â  However, neither is directly\r\n  linked to the other by testimony or documentary evidence.Â  The party who\r\n  received the evidence at SLED is not identified and the State presented no\r\n  testimony regarding how the evidence was handled while in Officer Locklear's\r\n  possession or once it was surrendered at SLED.Â  Officer Wilson testified she\r\n  received the evidence from the Log-In Department, but that is the extent of her\r\n  testimony regarding how the evidence came to be in her custody.Â  The record\r\n  does not reveal the date the evidence was left at SLED or where it was stored\r\n  pending Officer Wilson's receipt and analysis more than eight months after the\r\n  undercover drug buy.[3]\r\nWhile the chain of custody is only\r\n  required to be established as far as is reasonably practicable, South Carolina\r\n  courts have consistently held that all persons in the chain of custody must be\r\n  identified and the manner of handling the evidence must be demonstrated.[4] Â Sweet, 374 S.C. at 7-8, 647 S.E.2d at 206-07 (holding\r\n  chemist's report inadmissible in absence of evidence the confidential informant\r\n  procured drugs from defendant); State\r\n    v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, 522, 426 S.E.2d 306, 309 (1992) (reversing trial\r\n  court's admission of blood alcohol evidence when the identity of person who\r\n  drew sample or transported it to the hospital laboratory was not in evidence); Raino\r\n    v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 258, 422 S.E.2d 98, 100\r\n  (1992) (affirming trial court's suppression of blood alcohol evidence when the\r\n  identity of any party handling the blood was unknown even though the laboratory\r\n  was in close proximity to the trauma where sample was drawn); State\r\n    v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 27-28, 598 S.E.2d 735, 739 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding chain of custody was established when identity of each\r\n  custodian was established through documentary evidence and testimony although\r\n  evidence custodian was unavailable to testify at trial or via affidavit); State\r\n    v. Joseph, 328 S.C. 352, 364-65, 491 S.E.2d 275, 281-82 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (holding chemist's report was inadmissible when chemist was not produced to\r\n  testify after timely objection to report and chemist was party who retrieved\r\n  evidence from SLED drop box, retained possession for six months, and conducted\r\n  testing).Â \r\n  These requirements are not met in this case.\r\nThe\r\n  confidential informant, Officer Locklear, and Officer Wilson all testified the\r\n  drug evidence had not been tampered with between its procurement from Hatcher\r\n  and its receipt and analysis.Â  However, evidence the drugs had not been\r\n  tampered with is not sufficient to overcome missing links in the chain of\r\n  custody.Â  See State v. Chisolm, 355 S.C. 175, 584 S.E.2d 401 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003) (overruled on other grounds by Taylor, 360 S.C. at 27, 598 S.E.2d at 739).Â  In Chisolm,\r\n  the trial court admitted drug evidence when the State offered no testimony or\r\n  affidavit from the two custodians in the chain of custody between the\r\n  investigating officer and the analyst.Â  Id. at 177-78, 584 S.E.2d at 403.Â \r\n  In reversing the trial court, this court stated:\r\n\r\n\tThere is no dispute that the\r\n  State did not submit the testimony of each individual who handled the evidence\r\n  nor did the State comply with Rule 6(b). The trial court, however, allowed\r\n    the introduction of the evidence despite the missing links in the chain because\r\n    the State demonstrated that the evidence had not been tampered with by the time\r\n    [the chemist] received it for analysis. This was error.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 180, 584 S.E.2d at 404 (emphasis added).\r\nJust as in Chisolm, the trial court in this case\r\n  relied on the lack of proof that the evidence was somehow tainted.Â  However,\r\n  that alone is not enough to establish a sufficient chain of custody. \r\nWe note the case before us\r\n  is distinguishable from the line of cases in which the identity of the\r\n  custodian and method of handling are known but the manner of handling was\r\n  irregular in some respect.Â  In such cases, evidence may be admissible with any\r\n  irregularities going to the weight of the evidence as opposed to its\r\n  admissibility.Â  See Governor, 362 S.C. at 613, 608 S.E.2d at 476 (finding chain of custody requirement satisfied when all\r\n  custodians of blood sample were identified although officer did not follow department\r\n  directives in handling evidence); State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 567-68, 598 S.E.2d 279, 286 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding urine sample admissible when custodians were identified\r\n  even though it could not be explained how sample became packaged in a Styrofoam\r\n  container); State v.\r\n    Johnson, 318\r\n  S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d 442, 444 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding crack-cocaine evidence admissible when parties in chain\r\n  of custody were identified although dates of transfer were not entirely\r\n  consistent).\r\nTherefore,\r\n  based on the application of chain of custody law in the aforementioned cases,\r\n  we find the State did not establish a sufficient chain of custody and the drug\r\n  evidence should have been suppressed.\r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Instruction\r\nHatcher asserts the trial court erred in\r\n  providing the jury with an inaccurate instruction.Â  He argues by stopping its\r\n  instruction in the middle of the phrase &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot;\r\n  the trial court implied to the jury the burden of proof was lower than\r\n  constitutionally mandated.\r\nWe decline to reach this issue because\r\n  our resolution of the first issue is dispositive.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue\r\n  is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Hatcher's\r\n  distribution convictions are\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The informant hid the drugs under his tongue because\r\n  he was concerned other police officers not involved in the operation might find\r\n  him with the contraband.Â  Hiding drugs under the tongue is a common method for\r\n  transporting smaller quantities of illegal drugs.\r\n[2] When an evidence custodian does not testify at trial,\r\n  the party offering the evidence may submit the custodian's certified or sworn\r\n  statement identifying the substance or its container, stating the custodian\r\n  possessed it, and indicating the substance &quot;was delivered in substantially\r\n  the same condition as when received.&quot;Â  Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.\r\n[3] We also note the record contains no testimony\r\n  regarding how the drug evidence was transported back to Officer Locklear.Â \r\n  However, this link in the chain of custody would not necessarily prevent\r\n  admission of Officer Wilson's report provided the other previous links were\r\n  sufficiently established.\r\n[4] In South\r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 628-30,\r\n  614 S.E.2d 642, 646-49 (2005), the court approved the admission of test results\r\n  relating to a blood sample although DSS was unable to identify the courier who\r\n  transported the samples from the collection facility to the testing facility.Â  While Cochran can be construed to loosen the requirements of custodial\r\n  identification, the court was careful to limit its holding to the specific\r\n  facts of that case.Â  Id. at 629 n.1, 614 S.E.2d at 646 n.1.Â  We find the facts of Cochran to be readily distinguishable from this case.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4605","title":"Auto-Owners Insurance Company v.

(C&amp;B) and Lowcountry Signs, Inc.\r\n  (Lowcountry), which both conducted business under the name C&amp;B\r\n  Fabrication.Â  Samuel Rhodes is the sole owner and shareholder of Piedmont\r\n  Promotions, Inc. (Piedmont), which owns or leases outdoor advertising space in\r\n  various locations.Â  In 1999, Rhodes entered into discussions with Eadon and\r\n  C&amp;B to design, fabricate, and erect three outdoor advertising signs on\r\n  property owned by Rhodes that bordered Interstate 77 in Fairfield County, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  In addition, Rhodes obtained the necessary permits in the name of\r\n  Piedmont with the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) to erect\r\n  the three signs.Â  As a result of those discussions, C&amp;B agreed to complete\r\n  the signs for $153,960.Â  Throughout the period of fabrication and installation\r\n  of Rhodes' signs, C&amp;B and Lowcountry held a Commercial General Liability\r\n  Policy (the Policy) with Auto-Owners Insurance Company (Auto-Owners).Â  \r\nApproximately\r\n  ten months following the installation of the signs, the middle sign was\r\n  discovered to be leaning towards I-77.Â  Rhodes contacted Eadon, informing him\r\n  of the problem, and Eadon eventually sent a crew to address the issue.Â  Three\r\n  days after the crew visited the site, one of the other signs fell across I-77,\r\n  blocking both lanes of southbound traffic.Â  Rhodes immediately requested that\r\n  Eadon remove all three signs; however, Eadon removed only the one that\r\n  previously had been leaning, refusing to take down the sole remaining sign.Â \r\n  SCDOT investigated the incident, requiring Rhodes to remove all the signs, and\r\n  also revoked Piedmont's permits to maintain signs on the property in the\r\n  future.Â  Accordingly, Rhodes had the remaining sign removed.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Auto-Owners sent a reservation of rights letter to Eadon regarding the\r\n  incident, stating it was unsure as to whether a claim existed under the\r\n  Policy.Â  Over the next few months, Auto-Owners paid several claims for damages\r\n  caused by the fallen sign, but stated the Policy did not cover the majority of\r\n  expenses that would be incurred following the loss.Â  Thereafter, Rhodes and\r\n  Piedmont brought suit (Tort action) against Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication,\r\n  alleging damages to the real estate owned by Rhodes and lost income by Piedmont\r\n  due to the negligent design, fabrication, and erection of the signs by C&amp;B,\r\n  which led to the destruction of the three signs and the loss of the SCDOT\r\n  permits.Â  While the Tort action was pending, Auto-Owners filed this declaratory\r\n  judgment action (DJ action) against Rhodes, Piedmont Promotions, Eadon, and\r\n  Lowcountry, to determine coverage provided under the Policy.Â  Auto-Owners\r\n  contended there had been no occurrence, as defined under the policy, or\r\n  alternatively, that certain exclusions contained within the Policy avoided\r\n  coverage.Â  The complaint also sought a stay of the Tort action pending the\r\n  resolution of the DJ action.Â  It does not appear that this request for a stay\r\n  was ever considered by the court, and, in fact, the DJ action was deferred\r\n  pending the resolution of the Tort action.\r\nThe Tort action\r\n  resulted in a jury verdict in Rhodes' favor for three million dollars in actual\r\n  damages and three million five hundred thousand dollars in punitive damages.Â \r\n  Following the verdict, Auto-Owners moved to continue the DJ action in order to\r\n  obtain a copy of the Tort action transcript, which was granted.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  all parties to the DJ action made motions for summary judgment.Â  Auto-Owners\r\n  also made a motion to amend its complaint, which was granted.Â  In its amended\r\n  complaint, Auto-Owners proposed changing its caption from &quot;Marion L. Eadon\r\n  d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrications, Inc.&quot; to &quot;Marion L. Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B\r\n  Fabrication,&quot; as well as contending in its pleadings for the first time\r\n  that Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B was not insured under its policy.Â  The circuit court\r\n  denied all motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  DJ action was set for a jury trial with respect to one issue; however, prior to\r\n  the introduction of any evidence, the parties entered into a stipulation which,\r\n  for the purposes of the DJ action only, reformed the named insureds on the\r\n  Policy to reflect the fact that Eadon had insured several different companies\r\n  under the Policy over its life, and each of the companies was understood to\r\n  have done business under the name C&amp;B Fabrication. Â The circuit court then\r\n  decided the remaining issues before it non-jury, finding:Â  there was an &quot;occurrence&quot;\r\n  under the Policy that resulted in property damage to Rhodes; none of the argued\r\n  exclusions applied; Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication was an insured under the\r\n  Policy, and with the exception of the actual contractual cost of the three\r\n  signs, the judgment rendered in the Tort action should be paid by Auto-Owners\r\n  up to the Policy's limits; and post-judgment interest would accrue on the jury\r\n  verdict until such time as Auto-Owners paid, offered to pay, or deposited a sum\r\n  certain with the court.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the litigation in the DJ action continued, and before the order of the circuit\r\n  court referenced above was published, Eadon appealed the verdict in the Tort\r\n  action to this court. Â In an unpublished opinion, the verdict was reversed\r\n  based on the trial court's failure to grant Eadon's motion to transfer venue,\r\n  and the matter was remanded for a new trial in Eadon's county of residence,\r\n  Clarendon County.Â  Rhodes v. Eadon, Op. No. 2006-UP-413 (S.C. Ct. App.\r\n  filed Dec. 15, 2006).Â  In light of this development, Auto-Owners filed a\r\n  supplemental Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion,[1] and/or in the alternative, a Rule 60(b)(2), (4) and (5), SCRCP motion,\r\n  contending that because the underlying verdict in the Tort action had been\r\n  reversed by this court, the court's order in the DJ action was also null and\r\n  void, based on the order's reliance on the evidence and testimony of the\r\n  vacated action.Â  \r\nThe circuit\r\n  court took the matter under advisement, and thereafter issued a supplemental,\r\n  and then a revised supplemental order. Â Based on this court's reversal of the\r\n  Tort action, the circuit court granted Auto-Owners' motion in part, striking\r\n  the portion of its order referencing the money damages awarded by the jury;\r\n  however, the remaining portions of the order, including the determination that\r\n  Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication was an insured, there was an occurrence, and\r\n  that none of the exclusions applied, remained in full force and effect.[2]Â \r\n  Auto-Owners now appeals this determination.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.&quot;Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369\r\n  S.C. 160, 164-65, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;When\r\n  the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage exists\r\n  under an insurance policy, the action is one at law.&quot; Â Auto Owners Ins.\r\n    Co., Inc. v. Hamin, 368 S.C. 536, 540, 629 S.E.2d 683, 685 (Ct. App. 2006).Â \r\n  &quot;When reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a\r\n  jury, the appellate court's jurisdiction is limited to correction of errors at\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Epworth Children's Home v. Beasley,&nbsp;365 S.C. 157, 164,\r\n  616 S.E.2d 710, 714&nbsp;(2005).Â  &quot;[T]he appellate court will not disturb\r\n  the trial court's findings of fact unless they are found to be without evidence\r\n  that reasonably supports those findings.&quot; Â Hamin, 368 S.C. at 540,\r\n  629 S.E.2d at 685.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. RULE 60(b)(2), (4), and\r\n  (5), SCRCP, MOTION\r\nAuto-Owners\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in denying its post-trial motion under Rule\r\n  60(b)(2), (4), and (5), SCRCP, to both vacate its prior order and/or stay the\r\n  case pending the resolution of the Tort action.Â  Auto-Owners maintains that,\r\n  because the underlying Tort action was reversed by this court, no duty to\r\n  indemnify exists, and the retrial of the underlying action could produce a\r\n  verdict for Auto-Owners, under which no duty to indemnify would exist.Â  Auto-Owners\r\n  further contends that, based on the only partial-vacation of the circuit court's\r\n  order, there still exists repeated reliance on findings of the jury in the Tort\r\n  action to support its rulings, which amounts to cause for relief under Rule 60.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA party seeking to\r\n  set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting\r\n  evidence entitling him to the requested relief. Â Bowers\r\n    v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991). Â Whether\r\n  to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court. Â Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15,\r\n  17 (1992). Â On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial court\r\n  abused its discretion in granting or denying such a motion. Â Saro Invs. v.\r\n    Ocean Holiday P'ship, 314 S.C. 116, 124, 441 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nRule\r\n  60(b) states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  On\r\n    motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his\r\n    legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\r\n    following reasons:\r\n  . . . Â Â Â  (2) newly discovered evidence which by due\r\n      diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under\r\n      Rule 59(b);\r\n  . . .Â Â Â Â  (4) the judgment is void;\r\n  \r\n    (5) the\r\n      judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon\r\n      which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer\r\n      equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n  \r\n\r\nRule 60(b)(2), (4), and (5).\r\nWhile there is authority\r\n  elsewhere[3] that a DJ action is not ripe for adjudication until the underlying action for\r\n  damages has been resolved, this does not appear to be the law in South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Â In order to state a cause of action under the Uniform Declaratory\r\n  Judgments Act,[4] a party must demonstrate a justiciable controversy.Â  Power v. McNair,\r\n  255 S.C. 150, 154, 177 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1970).Â  &quot;A justiciable controversy\r\n  is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial\r\n  determination, as distinguished from a dispute or difference of a contingent,\r\n  hypothetical or abstract character.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The Declaratory\r\n  Judgments Act is a proper vehicle in which to bring a controversy before the\r\n  court when there is an existing controversy or at least the ripening seeds of a\r\n  controversy.&quot;Â  Sunset Cay, LLC v. City of Folly Beach, 357 S.C.\r\n  414, 423, 593 S.E.2d 462, 466 (2004).Â Â  In Peoples Federal Savings &amp;\r\n    Loan Ass'n of South Carolina v. Resource Planning, the supreme court\r\n  affirmed a previous holding from this court to the effect that a case or\r\n  controversy regarding the validity of a pre-emptive right does not accrue until\r\n  the right has been asserted.Â  358 S.C. 460, 596 S.E.2d 51 (2004) (concurring in\r\n  the result reached in Webb v. Reames, 326 S.C. 444, 485 S.E.2d 384 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997)).Â  Here, under the Peoples Federal court's reading of a\r\n  justiciable controversy, a right has been asserted against Eadon and C&amp;B,\r\n  the alleged insureds under the Policy; therefore, this DJ action appears to be\r\n  ripe for review.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  several South Carolina courts have tacitly approved the ripeness of a DJ action\r\n  during the pendency of the underlying action for damages.Â  In Isle of Palms\r\n    Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Insurance Co., this court discussed a\r\n  general liability policy in a DJ action, determining the insurance company had\r\n  a duty to defend an underlying action, and that if the damages alleged in the\r\n  complaint in the underlying action were proven, the insurance company had a\r\n  duty to indemnify the insured.Â  319 S.C. 12, 14-20, 459 S.E.2d 318, 319-22 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1994).Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the supreme court was faced with a very similar procedural scenario in Owners\r\n    Insurance Co. v. Clayton, when the underlying\r\n  tort action was filed by a third party, and the insurer defended the insured\r\n  under a full reservation of rights.Â  364 S.C. 555, 557, 614 S.E.2d 611, 612-13\r\n  (2005).Â  Prior to the trial for damages, the insurer filed a DJ action to\r\n  determine its liability under the policy.Â  Id. at 557-58, 614 S.E.2d at\r\n  613.Â  The underlying action was tried to a verdict, and the jury awarded the\r\n  third party $1.25 million dollars.Â  Id.Â  While the DJ action was\r\n  pending, the verdict was appealed and ultimately affirmed.Â  The court in the DJ\r\n  action found the insurer had a duty to indemnify the insured, and that order\r\n  was both appealed and affirmed during the pendency of the appeal from the\r\n  underlying jury award.Â  Id.Â  Clayton is illustrative of the\r\n  approach this court should take in the case at bar.Â  Although there is no indication\r\n  that any party in Clayton requested a stay, or otherwise challenged the\r\n  continued validity of the DJ action as not being ripe, the situation presented\r\n  in Clayton is extremely similar to the situation presented here, with\r\n  the exception that the underlying action was not reversed on appeal.Â  While\r\n  certiorari was still pending in the underlying action, the supreme court\r\n  affirmed the insurer's duty to indemnify the insured; accordingly, we address\r\n  the merits of this appeal, even in the absence of a specified damages award.[5]\r\nConsiderations\r\n  of fairness and judicial economy also dictate that Auto-Owners' request to set\r\n  aside or stay the judgment in the DJ action should be denied.Â  It was\r\n  Auto-Owners itself that filed this DJ action, and it was Auto-Owners that\r\n  requested in its complaint that the Tort action be stayed pending resolution of\r\n  this action.Â  Auto-Owners obviously believed at that time that its DJ action\r\n  could and should be resolved independent of what transpired in the Tort\r\n  action.Â  It would be a waste of judicial time and resources to set aside the\r\n  judgment in the DJ action simply because the jury verdict in the Tort action\r\n  was reversed and remanded.Â  The propriety of the circuit court's resolution of\r\n  the coverage issues can be addressed whether or not a judgment against Rhodes\r\n  is in place.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court's denial of Auto-Owners' Rule\r\n  60(b) motion is affirmed, and this court will review the substantive arguments\r\n  Auto-Owners presents on appeal.\r\nHowever,\r\n  the continued inclusion of references to the Tort action jury, verdict, and\r\n  damages in the circuit court's order is moot in view of the reversal of that\r\n  verdict.Â  We therefore vacate the portions of the order under &quot;The Policy\r\n  Provisions&quot; section, referencing the Tort action.\r\nII. EADON d/b/a C&amp;B'S\r\n  STATUS AS AN INSURED UNDER THE POLICY\r\nAuto-Owners\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in concluding &quot;Marion L. Eadon d/b/a\r\n  C&amp;B Fabrication&quot; is an insured under the Policy.Â  Auto-Owners alleges\r\n  error in finding:Â  Marion L. Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication is the same entity\r\n  as C&amp;B Fabricators, Inc. and LowCountry Signs &amp; Fabrication, Inc.;\r\n  Eadon met the definition of an insured based on his actions being on behalf of\r\n  the corporations listed on the policy; and Eadon reasonably expected to be\r\n  covered for his actions regardless of what entity was actually listed as the\r\n  named insured.\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication is an insured under the Policy.Â  The\r\n  court based its conclusion on several factors.Â  First, the court noted that,\r\n  although the Policy was issued to Eadon and named the insured as &quot;C&amp;B\r\n  Fabrications Inc. &amp; Low Country Signs Inc.,&quot; neither of those two\r\n  companies actually existed at the time the Policy was issued.Â  Instead, the two\r\n  companies, C&amp;B Fabricators, Inc. and Lowcountry Signs &amp; Fabrication,\r\n  Inc., were chartered by Eadon, and in the stipulation entered into by the\r\n  parties to this DJ action, the Policy was reformed to reflect the fact that\r\n  these two companies were the named insured under the Policy, and they both did\r\n  business under the trade name, C&amp;B Fabrication.Â  Additionally, Eadon was\r\n  sued in the underlying Tort action as doing business under the same name,\r\n  C&amp;B Fabrication.Â  Thus, the circuit court determined, it was the belief of\r\n  all the parties privy to the Policy that it would serve as coverage for the\r\n  sign-making business conducted by C&amp;B and by Eadon.Â  \r\nThe Policy sets out\r\n  who is considered an insured under Section II:\r\n\r\n  Who is\r\n    an insured\r\n  1. If\r\n    you are designated in the Declarations as:\r\n  \r\n    c. An\r\n      organization other than a partnership or joint venture, you are insured.Â  Your\r\n      executive officers and directors are insureds, but only with respect to their\r\n      duties as your officers or directors.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court found the\r\n  foregoing provision controlling, as C&amp;B Fabrication was listed under the\r\n  Policy as a corporation.Â  Moreover, based on the testimony, evidence, and\r\n  pleadings presented at trial, it was established that Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B\r\n  Fabrication served as the contact person for the contract with Rhodes and\r\n  Piedmont for the fabrication, delivery and installation of the three outdoor\r\n  billboard signs.Â  Eadon also served as the conduit for acquiring the necessary\r\n  insurance coverage for C&amp;B.Â  Based on this evidence the circuit court found\r\n  that coverage applied to Eadon under Section 1.c. of the Policy, because his dealings\r\n  with Rhodes and Piedmont were conducted with respect to his duties as an\r\n  officer of the company.\r\nAuto-Owners'\r\n  contention centers around its argument that Eadon fails to meet the definition\r\n  of an insured under the contract because none of the activities for which he\r\n  was sued in the Tort action fall within his duties as an officer of the\r\n  corporation.Â  Auto-Owners relies on several cases from other jurisdictions to\r\n  support this argument, primarily Creel v. Louisiana Pest Control Insurance,\r\n    Inc., 723 So.2d 440 (La. App. 3. Cir. 1998).Â  In Creel, the\r\n  Louisiana court found that under the plain meaning of the policy, &quot;an\r\n  executive officer is precluded from being an employee and, thus, an insured\r\n  except when performing his executive duties.&quot;Â  Id. at 443.Â  Because\r\n  the facts leading to the action involved an accident that occurred when the\r\n  executive in question was en route to spray a house for insects and pests, the Creel court found he was not performing his duties as an &quot;executive&quot; when\r\n  the accident occurred, thus the language of the policy excluded his coverage\r\n  under any duties he conducted as an &quot;employee.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Auto-Owners argues we should infer a similar result here because the\r\n  allegations contained in the Tort action related only to the negligent\r\n  fabrication and installation of the billboard signs, with which Eadon did not\r\n  participate.\r\nIn order to reach a\r\n  similar result, this court would have to find, for what appears to be the first\r\n  time in South Carolina, that the duties of an officer and those of an employee,\r\n  as delineated by a general commercial liability policy, are mutually\r\n  exclusive.Â  We decline to make that distinction the law in South Carolina.Â  As a\r\n  natural by-product of any contention regarding the activities that Eadon\r\n  undertook, Auto-Owners additionally maintains Rhodes and Piedmont should be\r\n  judicially estopped from arguing that coverage under the Policy should be\r\n  applied to Eadon because he was acting on behalf of the corporation.Â  In the\r\n  Tort action, Rhodes sued Eadon as an individual, and was in the first instance\r\n  successful, arguing that Eadon should be liable for negligence because he was not acting on behalf of the corporation in contracting for the signs.Â  Auto-Owners\r\n  maintains that Rhodes should be estopped from now arguing the exact opposite to\r\n  this court.Â  However, Auto-Owners' contention fails the fourth element of the\r\n  test[6] for judicial estoppel:Â  the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort\r\n  to mislead the court.Â  While it is true that during the Tort action against\r\n  Eadon, Rhodes argued Eadon had acted in an individual capacity, in this DJ\r\n  action, Rhodes is a party only by virtue of having been included by\r\n  Auto-Owners, and is not in privity with either party under the Policy at\r\n  issue.Â  While we are mindful of the implications a decision that Eadon is an\r\n  insured under the Policy could have on Rhodes' case in the retrial of the Tort\r\n  action, such implications may not influence our analysis of the legal issues\r\n  before us. Â Instead, we are required to answer the questions before us based on\r\n  the facts alleged.Â  Therefore, insofar as Eadon's responsibilities involved him\r\n  in the procurement of the contract with Rhodes and Piedmont, or the commercial\r\n  general liability policy with Auto-Owners, we hold he was an insured under the\r\n  Policy.\r\nAuto-Owners also\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in applying the reasonable expectations\r\n  doctrine, because it has been rejected and generally discredited as a basis for\r\n  interpreting a contract that is found to be ambiguous.Â  A close reading of the\r\n  circuit court's opinion reveals several instances where it refers to the\r\n  expectations of both parties; however, the order goes on to clearly state that\r\n  any potential ambiguity arising from the confusion of the corporations and\r\n  trade names of the parties involved in the litigation was resolved with the\r\n  parties' stipulation prior to the case's submission to the court.Â  The court's\r\n  order clearly finds coverage based on Eadon's actions as a director of the\r\n  corporation.Â  As a result, Auto-Owners' contention is without merit, and\r\n  coverage under the policy was not based on the reasonable expectations of the\r\n  parties.\r\nIII. EXISTENCE OF AN\r\n  OCCURRENCE\r\nAuto-Owners contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding an occurrence took place, as defined under the Policy, because the\r\n  alleged damage sustained was only to the fabricated signs as a result of the\r\n  insured's own faulty workmanship.\r\nThe Policy in this\r\n  case reads, in pertinent part:\r\nCoverage\r\n  A. Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.\r\n  Insuring Agreement\r\n\r\n  \r\n    a. We\r\n      will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as\r\n      damages because of &quot;bodily injury&quot; or &quot;property damage&quot; to\r\n      which this insurance applies.\r\n    . . .\r\n    b. This\r\n      insurance applies to &quot;bodily injury&quot; and &quot;property damage&quot;\r\n      only if:\r\n    \r\n      (1) The\r\n        &quot;bodily injury&quot; or &quot;property damage&quot; is caused by an &quot;occurrence&quot;\r\n        that takes place in the &quot;coverage territory.&quot;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n. . .\r\n  \r\n  Section\r\n  V â€“ Definitions\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n  9. &quot;Occurrence&quot;\r\n    means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially\r\n    the same general harmful conditions.\r\n  . . .\r\n  12. &quot;Property damage&quot; means:\r\n  \r\n    a.\r\n      Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of\r\n      that property.Â  All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of\r\n      the physical injury that caused it; or\r\n    b. Loss\r\n      of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.Â  All such loss\r\n      shall be deemed to occur at the time of the &quot;occurrence&quot; that caused\r\n      it.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn occurrence, as described\r\n  above, means an accident, although that term is not specifically defined in the\r\n  Policy; however, the term has been defined by the supreme court in a case\r\n  concerning an identical commercial general liability policy as &quot;[a]n unexpected\r\n  happening or event, which occurs by chance and usually suddenly, with harmful\r\n  result, not intended or designed by the person suffering the harm or hurt.&quot;Â  Green v. U. Ins. Co. of America, 254 S.C. 202, 206, 174 S.E.2d 400, 402\r\n  (1970).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found there was an occurrence, distinguishing the case of L-J v. Bituminous\r\n    Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., 366 S.C. 117, 621 S.E.2d 33 (2005).Â  In L-J,\r\n  the supreme court found the alleged damage did not constitute property damage\r\n  under a similar commercial general liability policy, because the claim was\r\n  merely one for faulty workmanship that resulted in damages to the work product\r\n  alone.Â  Id. at 123, 621 S.E.2d at 36.Â  However, the supreme court did\r\n  note that a commercial general liability policy could provide coverage when a\r\n  claim for faulty workmanship alleged third party bodily injury or damage to\r\n  other property.Â  Id. n. 4.\r\nThe L-J court examined the case of High Country Associates v. New Hampshire\r\n  Insurance Co., in which a condominium homeowners' association sued the\r\n  condominium builder seeking damages due to the negligent construction of the\r\n  buildings.Â  648 A.2d 474 (N.H. 1994).Â  The High Country case dealt with\r\n  the alleged continuous moisture intrusion from a subcontractor's defective installation\r\n  of siding resulting in moisture seeping into the buildings, which caused\r\n  pervasive decay of the interior and exterior walls and loss of structural\r\n  integrity of the condos.Â  Id. at 476.Â  The High Country court\r\n  found the claim under a similar commercial general liability policy was not\r\n  simply one for damages resulting from faulty workmanship, but rather, was a\r\n  claim for negligent construction resulting in property damage to the other\r\n  property.Â  Id. at 477.Â  This amounted to an occurrence for which\r\n  coverage would be provided.Â  Id. at 478.\r\nFinding\r\n  a parallel between the facts in this case and those present in High Country,\r\n  the circuit court found the damage alleged by Rhodes to not merely be damages\r\n  sustained to the work product alone, due to faulty workmanship, but also to the\r\n  &quot;other property&quot; of Rhodes.Â  We find the circuit court's analysis of\r\n  the alleged damages to Rhodes' property to be a proper extension of the supreme\r\n  court's notation in L-J of the potential for recovery under facts\r\n  similar to High Country.[7]Â \r\n  As a result, the circuit court's finding that the damages were a result of the unexpected\r\n  happening of the sign falling, thus constituting an occurrence under the Policy,\r\n  is upheld.\r\nIV. FALLING OF THE SIGN\r\n  CREATED PROPERTY DAMAGE\r\nAuto-Owners\r\n  contends the property damages found by the circuit court did not comport with\r\n  the definition of &quot;property damage&quot; in the policy.Â  Auto-Owners also\r\n  maintains that any alleged damage stemming from Rhodes' inability to reinstall\r\n  signs on the property should be excluded because the evidence introduced in the\r\n  Tort action is that SCDOT's refusal to reissue the necessary licenses resulted\r\n  from its determination that Rhodes was conducting a sham business.\r\nAs previously\r\n  described above, the Policy provides that property damage is defined as:\r\n\r\n  12. &quot;Property\r\n    damage&quot; means:\r\n  \r\n    a.\r\n      Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of\r\n      that property.Â  All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of\r\n      the physical injury that caused it; or\r\n    b. Loss\r\n      of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.Â  All such loss\r\n      shall be deemed to occur at the time of the &quot;occurrence&quot; that caused\r\n      it.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAuto-Owners contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to apply the principles of Braswell v.\r\n    Faircloth, 300 S.C. 338, 387 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App. 1989) to this case.Â  In Braswell,\r\n  an insured lessee left hazardous waste on the lessor's property when it vacated\r\n  the premises.Â  Id. at 339, 387 S.E.2d at 708.Â  The corrosive chemicals\r\n  that were left ate through the valve of the storage tank that held them,\r\n  releasing 1000 gallons of chemicals into an adjacent field.Â  Id. at 340,\r\n  387 S.E.2d at 708.Â  DHEC issued an order requiring the lessor to clean up the\r\n  property, and thereafter, when the lessor sued the lessee, the insurer defended\r\n  and denied coverage.Â  Id. at 340-41, 387 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Affirming in\r\n  part the grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer, this court found an\r\n  occurrence under the policy, but determined that any &quot;damages&quot;\r\n  attributable to the costs of removing the stored wastes and chemicals that had\r\n  not yet leaked were not recoverable, since no property damage had yet\r\n  resulted.Â  Id. at 345, 387 S.E.d at 711.Â  This court relied upon two\r\n  Fourth Circuit cases for its holding:Â  the first held that an insurer was not\r\n  obligated to indemnify an insured under a commercial general liability policy\r\n  when the underlying action was a suit by the federal government to seek\r\n  compliance with the directives of regulatory agencies.Â  Maryland Cas. Co. v.\r\n    Armco Inc., 822 F.2d 1348 (4th Cir. 1987).Â  The second held that an insurer\r\n  was not obligated to indemnify its insured in a suit to recover the response\r\n  costs of removing hazardous wastes.Â  Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Milliken &amp;\r\n    Co., 857 F.2d 979 (4th Cir. 1988). \r\nHowever,\r\n  the holding in Braswell has since been modified by the supreme court,\r\n  which specifically rejected the reasoning of Armco and Milliken.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594\r\n  S.E.2d 455 (2004).Â  In Helena, a business involved in the agricultural\r\n  chemicals market was required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and\r\n  State Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) to clean up three\r\n  sites that had been contaminated.Â  Id. at 634, 594 S.E.2d at 456.Â \r\n  Thereafter, the business sought reimbursement from its insurance company for\r\n  the cost of the clean-up required by the EPA and DHEC; however, the trial court\r\n  granted insurers summary judgment on the claims.Â  Id. at 635, 594 S.E.2d\r\n  at 457.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reversing the trial court on appeal, the supreme court rejected the reasoning\r\n  found in the Armco and Milliken cases that the clean-up costs\r\n  were not &quot;damages&quot; as defined by the insurance policy.Â  Id. at\r\n  638-41, 594 S.E.2d at 458-60.Â  The supreme court found the fourth circuit cases\r\n  too narrowly construed the term damages within an insurance contract.Â  Instead,\r\n  the Helena court cited to a Maryland case which had also rejected the\r\n  reasoning of the fourth circuit cases, finding &quot;the insurer's pledge to\r\n  pay damages will apply generally to compensatory outlays of various kinds,\r\n  including expenditures made to comply with administrative orders or formal\r\n  injunctions.&quot;Â  Id. at 638, 594 S.E.2d at 458 (quoting Bausch\r\n    &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 625 A.2d 1021 (1993)).Â  The circuit\r\n  court analogized the insurer's duty to pay expenditures having to do with\r\n  environmental clean-ups to the case at hand, wherein SCDOT deemed the remaining\r\n  two signs unsafe, and required Rhodes to take them down.Â  We find the circuit\r\n  court's analysis of Helena to be accurate, and, therefore, the cost\r\n  associated with Rhodes' required removal of the final sign comports with the\r\n  broader definition of damages or physical injury to tangible property defined\r\n  in subsection 12.a.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court also found the diminution in value of Rhodes' property\r\n  attributable to the loss of his permits to erect signs in the future, fit\r\n  within the second part of the definition of property damage: loss of use of\r\n  tangible property.Â  Thus, the Policy would provide coverage for lost profits\r\n  from the inability to maintain signs on the property and contributing to its\r\n  overall diminution in value.Â  Furthermore, the current law of this state\r\n  appears to be that a commercial general liability policy is intended to provide\r\n  coverage for tort liability for physical damage to property of others, but not\r\n  for the insured's contractual liability which causes economic losses.Â  See Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 566,\r\n  561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002) (citing Isle of Palms Pest Control Co. v.\r\n    Monticello Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 12, 459 S.E.2d 318 (Ct. App. 1995), aff'd,\r\n  321 S.C. 310, 468 S.E.2d 304 (1996)).Â  \r\nAuto-Owners,\r\n  meanwhile, contends the circuit court ignored the evidence it presented that\r\n  the reason Rhodes could not reinstall the signs on his property was not that\r\n  SCDOT found them to be unsafe, but rather because Rhodes was conducting a sham\r\n  business.Â  See Rhodes v. Eadon, Op. No. 2006-UP-413 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. filed Dec. 15, 2006) (detailing in the Facts portion of the opinion that\r\n  Rhodes' application to SCDOT for new permits was denied because the Interstate\r\n  was not a qualifying commercial business, but was being operated as a sham.Â \r\n  Rhodes appealed the denial to the Administrative Law Court, which affirmed\r\n  SCDOT's finding of a sham activity).Â  However, this information and argument does\r\n  not negate the existence of evidence of property damages under the Policy,\r\n  requiring our affirmance of the circuit court under our standard of review on\r\n  appeal.Â  Rather, the evidence that Rhodes' application for a new license was\r\n  denied as a sham is evidence that should be introduced and properly weighed by\r\n  the jury in the retrial of the Tort action.\r\nV.

Columbia Lumber &amp; Manufacturing.\r\n    Co., 299 S.C. 335, 384 S.E.2d 730 (1989), in the context of when a builder\r\n  has violated a legal duty under a negligence action.Â  The supreme court in Kennedy stated:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    builder may be liable to a home buyer in tort despite the fact the buyer\r\n    suffered only &quot;economic losses&quot; where:Â  (1) the builder has violated\r\n    an applicable building code; (2) the builder has deviated from industry\r\n    standards; (3) the builder has constructed housing that he knows or should know\r\n    will pose serious risks of physical harm.\r\n\r\nId. at 346-47, 384 S.E.2d at 737-38; see also Colleton\r\n  Preparatory Academy, Inc. v. Hoover Universal, Inc., 379 S.C. 181, 666\r\n  S.E.2d 247 (2008) (discussing the exception to the economic loss rule in the\r\n  context of a home buyer).Â  Based on the evidence and testimony provided at trial,\r\n  the circuit court determined Eadon violated all three of these conditions.Â  The\r\n  circuit court was correct in its determination that Exclusion l does not apply,\r\n  as the &quot;products-completed operations hazard&quot; cannot serve as a broadly\r\n  written catch-all exclusion that would prohibit recovery no matter what\r\n  consequences &quot;arise out of&quot; the product of the insured.\r\nAuto-Owners next\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in finding Exclusion m does not apply.Â \r\n  Exclusion m expressly states that:Â  &quot;[t]his exclusion does not apply to\r\n  the loss of use of other property arising out of sudden and accidental physical\r\n  injury to &quot;your product&quot; or &quot;your work&quot; after it has been\r\n  put to its intended use.&quot;Â  The circuit court found, and we agree, that a\r\n  sudden and accidental physical injury to Eadon's product is precisely what\r\n  precipitated the events that led to the filing of this DJ action.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the caveat provided in the Policy itself prevents the applicability of Exclusion\r\n  m under the facts of this case. \r\nFinally,\r\n  Auto-Owners contends the circuit court erred in failing to apply Exclusion n.Â \r\n  As discussed by the circuit court, exclusions like n are commonly referred to\r\n  as &quot;sistership&quot; exclusions.Â  These exclusions are typically included\r\n  and applied to shield insurers from liability for the costs associated with\r\n  unanticipated product recalls, and do not apply to claims involving losses\r\n  resulting from the failure of the insured's product or work, when there is no\r\n  evidence of a general recall of similar products or materials from the market\r\n  place.Â  See Erie Ins. Exchange v. Colony Dev. Corp., 736 N.E.2d\r\n  941 (Oh. Ct. App. 1999); Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Chester â€“ O'Donley &amp;\r\n    Assocs., Inc., 972 S.W.2d 1 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).Â  The circumstances giving\r\n  rise to the Tort action, without question, did not involve a product recall;\r\n  therefore, the circuit court did not err in finding Exclusion n inapplicable to\r\n  this case.\r\nCONCLUSION[8]\r\nWe find it appropriate, in the interest of judicial\r\n  economy and fairness, as well as the previous positions taken by parties to\r\n  this action, for this court to reach the merits of this DJ action, rather than to\r\n  stay the case pending the retrial of the Tort action.Â  However, as noted above,\r\n  we vacate the portions of the circuit court's order, under &quot;The Policy\r\n  Provisions&quot; section, referencing the former verdict in the Tort action.Â \r\n  On the merits, we find the circuit court was correct in its determination that:\r\n  Â Eadon d/b/a C&amp;B Fabrication was an insured under the Policy; there was an\r\n  occurrence resulting in damages; and that none of the exclusions in the Policy\r\n  apply.Â  As a result, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nKONDUROS, J., and\r\n  JONES, A.A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prior to the\r\n  reversal of the verdict in the Tort action, Auto-Owners had filed both an\r\n  initial and an amended Rule 59(e) motion, as well as a motion for a new trial.Â  \r\n[2] This court's unpublished\r\n  reversal was later appealed to the supreme court, which denied certiorari.Â  \r\n[3] See Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London\r\n  v. Boeing Company, 895 N.E.2d 940, 959 (Ill. App. Ct. 2008) (an insurer's\r\n  duty to indemnify was not ripe, because an actual controversy, e.g. a legal\r\n  obligation to pay damages in the underlying action, did not yet exist).Â  In\r\n  addition, other courts have held that in order to eliminate the risk of\r\n  inconsistent factual determinations that could prejudice an insured, a\r\n  stay of a DJ action pending resolution of a third-party suit is appropriate\r\n  when the coverage question turns on facts to be litigated in the underlying\r\n  action.Â  See Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Superior Court, 861 P.2d\r\n  1153 (Cal. 1993); Cal. Ins. Guarantee Ass'n v. Superior Court, 231 Cal.\r\n  Rptr. 104 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991); Gen. of Am. Ins. Co. v. Lilly, 65 Cal.\r\n  Rptr. 750 (Cal. Ct. App. 1968); Constitution Assocs. v. N.H., Ins. Co.,\r\n  930 P.2d 556 (Colo. 1996); Citizens Communications Co. v. Am. Home Assurance\r\n    Co., 2004 WL 423059 (Me. 2004); Chantel Assocs. v. Mount Vernon Fire\r\n      Ins. Co., 656 A.2d 779 (Md. 1995).\r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§Â§ 15-53-10 to -140 (Supp. 2008).\r\n[5] This case is easily distinguishable from the\r\n  situation faced by the supreme court in Park v. Safeco Insurance Co. of\r\n    America, 251 S.C. 410, 162 S.E.2d 709 (1968).Â  In Park, the supreme\r\n  court held that a DJ action was not ripe for judicial pronouncement due to the\r\n  lack of a justiciable controversy, when the third-party, injured plaintiff\r\n  brought suit against the insurer prior to filing a legal complaint against the\r\n  alleged at-fault insured.Â  Finding the injured third party lacked the\r\n  contractual privity to preemptively sue to establish the parties' liabilities\r\n  under the insurance contract, the court found the insured must first become\r\n  liable for damages before any rights vested in the injured party.Â  The case\r\n  before us is substantially different than Park, because here, the\r\n  insured instituted this action after the Tort action complaint had been filed,\r\n  against both Eadon and Rhodes; therefore, an actual controversy exists, and the Park court's concerns over privity are not present.\r\n[6] The elements of\r\n  judicial estoppel include:Â  (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one\r\n  another; (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each\r\n  other; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some benefit; (4) the\r\n  inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and\r\n  (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.Â  Cothran\r\n    v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215-16, 592 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2004).\r\n[7] We note the\r\n  supreme court has considered a case with facts similar to those in High\r\n    Country, in Auto-Owners Insurance Co. v. Newman, Op. No. 26450 (S.C.\r\n  filed March, 10 2008), reaching the same result as the circuit court in this\r\n  case.Â  However, although an opinion in Newman was issued, rehearing was\r\n  subsequently granted by the court, and after arguments were held November 8,\r\n  2008, no substitute opinion has been published to date.Â  Therefore, while the\r\n  previously-released opinion is favorable to the result reached by the circuit\r\n  court, we did not rely on it for considerations of this appeal.\r\n[8] Auto-Owners also\r\n  presents several additional bases of error by the circuit court.Â  First,\r\n  Auto-Owners contends the circuit court erred in relying on findings of facts unsupported\r\n  by the record before it; specifically, where the order is inconsistent with the\r\n  transcript of the Tort action.Â  This argument is without merit because the\r\n  circuit court, as trier of fact in an action without a jury, is entitled to\r\n  make its own findings of fact.Â  Epworth,&nbsp;365 S.C. at 164, 616\r\n  S.E.2d at 714&nbsp;(&quot;When reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case\r\n  tried without a jury, the appellate court's jurisdiction is limited to\r\n  correction of errors at law.&quot;). Â Second, Auto-Owners contends the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding C&amp;B is entitled to payment from Auto-Owners for the\r\n  expense it incurred in the removal of the final sign left standing.Â  As\r\n  discussed above, Helena is instructive as to whether the costs of taking\r\n  down the third sign, in order to comply with SCDOT's mandate, falls under the\r\n  ambit of the plain and ordinary definition of the word damages.Â  357 S.C. 631,\r\n  594 S.E.2d 455 (2004).Â  Under our standard of review, there exists evidence in\r\n  the record to support the circuit court's determination on this matter;\r\n  therefore we will not set aside this finding on appeal.Â  See Hamin,\r\n  368 S.C. at 540, 629 S.E.2d at 685 (&quot;[T]he appellate court will not\r\n  disturb the trial court's findings of fact unless they are found to be without\r\n  evidence that reasonably supports those findings.&quot;).Â  Moreover, although\r\n  Auto-Owners states neither Eadon nor C&amp;B pursued a claim for reimbursement\r\n  in the DJ action, Eadon and C&amp;B's amended answer and counterclaim\r\n  specifically prays for the costs incurred by the Respondents in rectifying the\r\n  consequential damages caused by the removal of the signs. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4606","title":"Foster v.

In November 2005, Foster was treated for congestive heart failure\r\n    and spent several weeks in the hospital. After leaving the hospital,\r\n    Foster lived at Langston House, an assisted living facility, until December\r\n    2006. \r\n  While Foster was living in Langston House, Burbage\r\n    handled his finances. Â Burbage and Foster shared a joint checking account. Â Foster\r\n    claimed Burbage shared his account so she could use the funds to provide for\r\n    his care.Â  In October 2006, Burbage liquidated a CD belonging to Foster worth\r\n    $45,000 and deposited the money into their joint checking account.Â  She\r\n    later moved the money into a money market account in the Appellants' names.Â \r\n    After leaving Langston House, Foster moved into the home of his current wife,\r\n    Vera Snow.Â  \r\n  The Appellants failed to include Foster's complaint\r\n    and their answer in the record.Â Â  It appears from the trial court's order and\r\n    the arguments made at the summary judgment hearing that Foster filed suit\r\n    alleging the Appellants took money from his checking account and other property\r\n    from him.Â  Subsequently, it appears the appellants refused to return Foster's\r\n    property upon request.Â  Foster also asked the trial court to void the\r\n    deed he signed to his home. \r\n  Burbage\r\n    testified she was the trustee for her brothers, and she was to divide Foster's\r\n    property between the three siblings equally. However, Burbage also testified\r\n    she was not aware of any written trust declaration created by Foster. Â Foster\r\n    contends he signed the deed without reading it because he trusted his daughter\r\n    to act in accordance with his wishes. Â Â Â Furthermore, Burbage admitted\r\n    she made telephone money transfers from Foster's account into the money market\r\n    account totaling $73,800. Burbage testified the money was moved so it\r\n    would be protected and gain interest. She further testified that\r\n    Foster's property belonged to him even though it was in an account in the\r\n  Appellants' names.Â  \r\n  At trial, the Appellants argued Foster was mentally\r\n    incompetent. Burbage testified her father was not thinking rationally,\r\n    exhibited behavioral changes, and suffered from severe memory lapses. The\r\n    Appellants never produced any medical evidence to support their allegations,\r\n    and Foster testified he had never been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's\r\n    disease.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n  The trial court granted Foster's motion for summary\r\n    judgment. The trial court found there was no genuine issue of material\r\n    fact as to Foster's mental competence, voided the deed, and ordered the\r\n    Appellants to transfer Foster $73,800. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n    this court applies the same standard of review as the trial court under Rule\r\n    56, SCRCP.Â  Miller v. Blumenthal\r\n      Mills, Inc.,&nbsp; 365 S.C. 204, 219,\r\n    616 S.E.2d 722, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when no\r\n    issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n    judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;In determining whether\r\n    any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n    must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Pye\r\n      v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006).Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Deed\r\n  The Appellants argue the trial court erred in voiding the\r\n    deed signed by Foster conveying his home to Burbage as trustee. Â Specifically,\r\n    the Appellants rely on Cunningham v. Cunningham to support their\r\n    assertion that a trust instrument may consist of more than one writing.Â  81\r\n    S.C. 506, 62 S.E. 845 (1908). They contend the signed deed and Foster's will,\r\n    which leaves his home to his children, are enough evidence to prove a trust was\r\n    created.Â  Foster argues his will does not reference a trust and no written\r\n    trust agreement ever existed. Furthermore, Foster contends the deed named a\r\n    grantee that did not exist and is, therefore, void. Â We agree with Foster.\r\n  Here, the trial court found there was no trust\r\n    account; therefore, no trust existed. Accordingly, the trial court voided the\r\n    deed. To prove the existence of a trust, the following elements must be\r\n    shown: (1) a declaration creating the trust, (2) a trust res, and (3) designated beneficiaries. Â Whetstone\r\n      v. Whetstone, 309 S.C. 227, 231, 420 S.E.2d 877, 879&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n    1992).Â Â  Furthermore, the trust declaration must be in writing when the trust\r\n    property includes realty.Â  Id.Â  The Appellants have not produced a written declaration\r\n    creating a trust, and Burbage testified she was not aware of any trust Foster created.Â \r\n    Moreover, while the Appellants contend they are the beneficiaries of the trust,\r\n    they failed to present a trust document or any other evidence to support their\r\n    position. Because no written trust document was presented to the court, we do\r\n    not believe a trust existed. Therefore, Burbage was not a trustee.Â  Without a\r\nÂ \r\n  Although there are no South Carolina cases on point, the\r\n    facts of this case are similar to those in Gifford v. Linnell, where the\r\n    North Carolina Court of Appeals found a deed was void for lack of a grantee. Â 579\r\n    S.E.2d 440, 443 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003). Â The deed in Gifford specified the\r\n    property was conveyed to &quot;Beth Linnell, Trustee of Droffig Family\r\n    Trust.&quot;Â  Id. at 442.Â  The court found that because the deed\r\n    referred to Linnell as a trustee, she was a grantee only in her representative\r\n    capacity and not in her individual capacity.Â  Id. at 443.Â  Furthermore,\r\n    the court found that because the trust was not in existence on the date of conveyance,\r\n    the deed failed to identify a valid grantee.Â  Id. at 442.Â  Thus, the\r\n    court ruled that Linnell was not the intended grantee at the time of the deed's\r\n    execution, but rather was the representative of a non-existing legal entity. Â Id. at 443. Â Therefore, the court voided the deed for lack of a grantee.Â  Id. Â Â Adopting the court's reasoning in Gifford, we believe the use of the\r\n    words &quot;as trustee&quot; following Burbage's name indicates she was not a\r\n    grantee in her individual capacity.Â  Consequently, because a trust does not\r\n    exist, we find the deed is void because it designates a grantee that does not\r\n    exist.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment on\r\n    this issue.Â Â  \r\nII. Transfer of Funds\r\n  \r\n    A. Gift\r\n  \r\n  The Appellants argue the trial\r\n    court erred in granting summary judgment and ordering them to pay Foster $73,800.\r\n    Â Specifically, they contend a portion of this sum, the $45,000 CD, was a gift\r\n    from Foster.[2] Burbage contends the CD was a gift from Foster because he gave her the CD\r\n    and instructed her to split the money between the Appellants when it matured.Â  However,\r\n    she also testified that the money was moved so it would be protected and gain\r\n    interest. Â Foster testified the CD was not a gift. Â Because of the conflicting\r\n    testimony regarding the CD, we find a genuine issue of material fact exists as\r\n    to whether the CD was a gift from Foster. Â See Rule 56(c), SCRCP\r\n    (&quot;[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,\r\n    depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n    the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n    fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n    law&quot;). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's decision to award Foster\r\n    the $45,000 CD. \r\n  \r\n    B. Assisted Care Expenses\r\n  \r\n  The Appellants also argue the\r\n    trial court erred in granting summary judgment regarding the remaining portion\r\n    of the $73,800.Â  Specifically, they allege a portion of the funds was used to\r\n    pay Foster's assisted care expenses.Â  While the exact amount of funds spent on\r\n    Foster's assisted care expenses is unclear, the Appellants do allege they used\r\n    at least $6,800 to pay these expenses.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for\r\n    review.Â  At the summary judgment\r\n    hearing, the Appellants argued they were fiduciaries responsible for protecting\r\n    Foster's assets. Â However, they did not argue that the funds were used for\r\n    Foster's assisted care expenses.Â  Therefore, because the Appellants failed to\r\n    raise this argument to the trial court, this issue is not preserved for review.\r\n    Â S.C. Dept. of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301,\r\n    641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (holding that in order for an issue to be preserved\r\n    for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n    judge).\r\n  \r\n      C. Competency \r\n\r\nThe Appellants argue the trial court erred in finding there\r\n    was no genuine issue of material fact as to Foster's mental competency. We\r\n  disagree. \r\n  The trial court found the Appellants failed to present\r\n    competent evidence from a physician or otherwise to establish that Foster was mentally\r\n    incompetent. Â The Appellants contend there was ample testimony that Foster\r\n    suffered from dementia, was incapable of handling his own finances, showed\r\n    signs of confusion and memory loss, and was not thinking rationally. Foster testified\r\n    he had never been diagnosed with dementia and argues that the Appellants were\r\n    unable to present any medical evidence to support their allegations. Because\r\n    the Appellants failed to offer any evidence aside from Burbage's allegations\r\n    that Foster was mentally incompetent, we find the trial court did not err in\r\n    finding there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding Foster's mental competency. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (&quot;[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered\r\n    forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n    admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n    genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n    a judgment as a matter of law&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the grant of\r\n    summary judgment as to this issue.Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We find the trial court did not err in voiding the\r\n    deed and finding the Appellants failed to create a genuine issue of material\r\n    fact regarding Foster's mental competency. We do, however, find the trial court\r\n    erred in awarding Foster the $45,000 CD based on conflicting evidence presented\r\n    during the summary judgment hearing. Â Furthermore, we find the Appellant's\r\n    argument that the funds owed to Foster were used for his assisted care expenses\r\n    is not preserved for review.Â  Accordingly, the trial court's order is Â Â \r\n  AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n  SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Foster revoked Burbage's power of attorney in\r\n  December 2006.Â  Â \r\n[2] Foster argues this issue is not preserved for review\r\n  because the Appellants did not raise it to the trial court.Â  We find this issue\r\n  is preserved because Burbage testified in her deposition that Foster told her\r\n  to divide the CD between the Appellants when it matured.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4607","title":"Duncan v.

originating under the hood of their 2000 Ford Expedition, destroyed their\r\n  home.Â  The Duncans alleged Ford knowingly installed a defective speed control\r\n  deactivation switch into the vehicle, which caused it to ignite.Â  At the\r\n  conclusion of trial, the jury awarded the Duncans $620,759.79 in actual damages, reduced to $589,721.80\r\n  in proportion to their comparative fault, and $3 million in punitive damages.Â \r\n  Ford appeals.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nFord manufactured the Duncans' Ford\r\n  Expedition in December 1999.Â  A short time later, the Duncans purchased the\r\n  vehicle and drove it without major incident until March 1, 2005.Â  On that day, Anna Duncan parked her vehicle in the\r\n  carport next to her home and walked inside.Â  A few minutes later, her husband,\r\n  Jerry, walked outside and observed fire coming from underneath the hood of the\r\n  Expedition.Â  Upon seeing the fire, Jerry told his wife to call 911, tried to\r\n  put the fire out with a fire extinguisher, and attempted to drive the car away\r\n  from their home.Â  When the fire extinguisher failed and the car did not start,\r\n  Jerry attempted to use the hayfork on the front of his tractor to remove the\r\n  car from the premises.Â  However, this effort was also unsuccessful.Â  By this\r\n  time, the fire had spread to the carport, and strong winds quickly pushed the\r\n  flames from the carport to the Duncans' adjacent home.Â  The Duncans fled to the\r\n  end of the driveway and watched as the fire destroyed their home.Â  \r\nPrior to this\r\n  incident, Ford recalled two lines of vehicles because of under-hood fires.Â \r\n  First, in 1999, Ford recalled the panther platform line of vehicles, consisting\r\n  of the Lincoln Town Car, the Ford Crown Victoria, and the Mercury Grand\r\n  Marquis.Â  Later, in 2005, Ford recalled the F-Series line of vehicles,\r\n  including the Expedition.Â  Ford attributed the under-hood fires in both lines\r\n  of vehicles to the failure of the speed control deactivation switch (the\r\n  switch).Â  The switch, designed and manufactured by Texas Instruments, contained\r\n  a hydraulic side and an electrical side separated by a thin layer of plastic\r\n  called the kapton seal.Â  The chief function of the kapton seal was to prevent\r\n  brake fluid from entering the electrical side of the switch.Â  In both the 1999\r\n  and 2005 recalls, Ford determined the fires were caused by the failure of the\r\n  kapton seal to prevent fluid from entering the electrical side of the switch.Â \r\n  Ford first installed the switch in panther platform vehicles in 1992.Â  The next\r\n  year, Ford installed the switch in the F-Series line of vehicles.Â  The design\r\n  of the switch and its component parts has remained unchanged since its initial\r\n  installation in the panther platform line of vehicles in 1992.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOne month after the\r\n  1999 recall of the panther platform vehicles, a group of scientists employed by\r\n  Ford produced an internal document, the Special Investigation Team Report (SIT\r\n  Report), which analyzed the cause of the fires and proposed solutions to remedy\r\n  the problem.Â  In the report, dated June 11, 1999, Ford acknowledged it did not\r\n  completely understand the cause of the fires.Â  However, the report identified\r\n  one of the potential causes as the failure of the kapton seal to prevent brake\r\n  fluid from entering the electrical side of the switch.Â  The report did not\r\n  mention deviations in the manufacturing process at Texas Instruments as a\r\n  reason for the fires.Â Â  The report outlined ten possible solutions to remedy\r\n  the fires.Â  Ford did not implement any of these proposed solutions and did not\r\n  alter the kapton seal of the switch during the 1999 recall. \r\nAccording to Ford's\r\n  expert witness, Mark Hoffman, Ford neither incorporated the fixes proposed by\r\n  the report nor altered the kapton seal because it determined that the seal's\r\n  failure and the subsequent fires were caused by manufacturing problems at Texas\r\n  Instruments.Â  Specifically, Hoffman noted the change in the manufacturing\r\n  process at Texas Instruments, from a manual to an automated system, resulted in\r\n  component parts deviating from the specifications required by Ford.Â \r\n  Accordingly, during the 1999 recall, Ford took two steps.Â  First, it ensured\r\n  that Texas Instruments resolved its manufacturing issues.Â  Second, it replaced\r\n  the switches in the panther platform series deviating from its specifications\r\n  with switches conforming to its specifications.Â  \r\nThe Duncans'\r\n  expert, Jeff Morrill, made three observations when comparing the fire in the\r\n  Duncans' Expedition to the fires in the recalled 1999 panther platform line of vehicles.Â \r\n  First, the switches found in both were identical.Â  Second, the fires were\r\n  caused by the failure of the kapton seal to prevent brake fluid from entering\r\n  into the electrical side of the switch.Â  Third, Ford knew of the failure of the\r\n  kapton seals before manufacturing the Duncans' 2000 Expedition as evidenced by the\r\n  1999 recall itself and the SIT Report.Â  The Duncans then asked Kendrick\r\n  Richardson, an expert in mechanical engineering, whether Ford breached the\r\n  engineering standard of care, assuming the above observations reached by\r\n  Morrill were correct.Â  Richardson responded in the affirmative.Â  The trial\r\n  court precluded Ford from cross-examining Morrill and Richardson about the\r\n  manufacturing problems at Texas Instruments, ruling this line of questioning\r\n  was irrelevant.[1]Â  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the Duncans, awarding them $620,759.79 in\r\n  actual damages, reduced to $589,721.80 in proportion to their comparative\r\n  fault, and $3 million in punitive damages.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;[T]he\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence in general is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court.&quot;Â  Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C.\r\n  19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  &quot;To warrant reversal based on the\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of\r\n  the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable\r\n  probability the jury's verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or\r\n  lack thereof.&quot;Â  Id. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  Appellate courts\r\n  apply a de novo standard of review in determining whether an award of punitive\r\n  damages is constitutionally excessive.Â  Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman\r\n    Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 436 (2001).Â  However, the factual findings\r\n  made by the district court in conducting the excessiveness inquiry must be\r\n  accepted unless clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 435.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\r\nA.Â  Qualifications\r\n  of Jeff Morrill\r\nAt trial, Jeff\r\n  Morrill was qualified as an expert in the field of cause and origin of fire;\r\n  however, the trial court found he was not qualified to offer design opinions.Â  Ford\r\n  asserts the trial court erred by allowing Morrill to present design opinions.Â  Ford\r\n  alleges Morrill gave design opinions when he testified about the reasons for\r\n  the 1999 and 2005 recalls.Â  In addition, Ford argues Morrill presented a design\r\n  opinion when he concluded the cause of the recalls was the same.Â  Lastly, Ford\r\n  claims the trial court erred by allowing Morrill to testify about the 1999 SIT\r\n  Report because he never worked for Ford and had no firsthand knowledge\r\n  regarding the 1999 recall or the report.Â  We disagree.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe qualification\r\n  of an expert witness and the admissibility of expert testimony are matters\r\n  within the discretion of the trial court. Â Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier\r\n    Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997).Â  A trial court's\r\n  ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony constitutes an abuse of\r\n  discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair.Â  Means\r\n    v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 166, 558 S.E.2d 921, 924 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;The\r\n  facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion\r\n  or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert\r\n  at or before the hearing.&quot;Â  Rule 703, SCRE.Â  \r\nContrary to Ford's\r\n  assertions, Morrill testified exclusively in his area of expertiseâ€”cause and\r\n  origin of fireâ€”and never offered any design opinions.Â  He testified that Ford\r\n  recalled both lines of vehicles because of under-hood fires.Â  Next, Morrill stated\r\n  the cause of the fires in both lines of vehicles was due to the failure of the kapton seal to prevent brake fluid from entering the electrical side of the\r\n  switch.Â  Morrill never testified that the kapton seal was defectively designed;\r\n  rather, he only stated it caused fires.Â  As an expert in cause and origin of\r\n  fire, Morrill was qualified to offer such an opinion.Â  In forming his\r\n  conclusion, Morrill relied on the SIT Report.Â  Because he relied on the report\r\n  in forming his opinion, Morrill could testify about the report, regardless of\r\n  whether he possessed firsthand knowledge of the report, the recalls, or worked\r\n  at Ford.Â  See Hundley ex. rel. Hundley v. Rite Aid of S.C., Inc.,\r\n  339 S.C. 285, 295, 529 S.E.2d 45, 50 (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;An expert witness\r\n  may state an opinion based on facts not within his firsthand knowledge.&quot;); State v. Slocumb, 336 S.C. 619, 640, 521 S.E.2d 507, 518 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n  (noting an expert may testify about the facts or data upon which he or she\r\n  bases an opinion, as long as they are of a type reasonably relied upon by other\r\n  experts in the field). Â Accordingly, the trial court properly allowed Morrill\r\n  to testify in his area of expertise at trial and further, did not err in\r\n  allowing him to base his opinion on the SIT Report.Â Â  \r\nB.Â  Richardson Hypothetical\r\nNext, Ford argues\r\n  the trial court erred by allowing the Duncans to ask Kendrick Richardson\r\n  whether Ford breached its engineering standard of care based on the conclusions\r\n  of Morrill.Â  Ford asserts the question was misleading because it failed to\r\n  mention the manufacturing problems at Texas Instruments that led to the 1999\r\n  recall.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn expert can offer\r\n  opinions based upon hypothetical questions embracing facts supported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  Gazes v. Dillard's Dep't Store, Inc., 341 S.C. 507, 514, 534\r\n  S.E.2d 306, 310 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A hypothetical question need not include\r\n  all of the details in a particular case.Â  Brown v. La France Indus., 286\r\n  S.C. 319, 327, 333 S.E.2d 348, 353 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  It is sufficient that\r\n  substantially all the material facts necessary to the\r\n  formation of an intelligent opinion are included\r\n  in the hypothetical question.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nWe have already\r\n  determined Morrill was qualified to offer the testimony he presented at trial.Â \r\n  As a result, Richardson, an expert in the field of mechanical engineering,\r\n  could give his opinion as to whether Ford breached its engineering standard of\r\n  care based on Morrill's conclusions.Â  See Gazes, 341 S.C. at 514,\r\n  534 S.E.2d at 310 (noting an expert can answer hypothetical questions based\r\n  upon evidence admitted at trial).Â  In addition, the question was not misleading\r\n  even though it omitted the manufacturing problems at Texas Instruments.Â  The\r\n  question was based on Morrill's testimony and the SIT Report.Â  Neither Morrill's\r\n  Testimony nor the SIT Report referred to manufacturing issues at Texas\r\n  Instruments.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\r\n  allowing Richardson to respond to the hypothetical question posed by the\r\n  Duncans.Â  \r\nC.Â  Cross-examination of Morrill and Richardson\r\nFord asserts the\r\n  trial court erred in preventing it from asking the Duncans' experts, Morrill\r\n  and Richardson, who manufactured the switch and why Ford decided to recall the\r\n  panther platform line of vehicles in 1999.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\n&quot;The scope of\r\n  cross-examination rests largely in the discretion of the trial court.&quot;Â  Watson\r\n    ex rel. Watson v. Chapman, 343 S.C. 471, 482, 540 S.E.2d 484, 489 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000).Â  To warrant the reversal of a limitation placed on the scope of\r\n  cross-examination by the trial court, a manifest abuse of discretion and\r\n  prejudice must be demonstrated.Â  Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc.\r\n    v. Lighthouse Reality, Inc., 286 S.C. 261, 266, 332 S.E.2d 781, 784 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1985).Â  A manufacturer who incorporates into his product\r\n  a component made by another has a responsibility\r\n  to test and inspect such component, and his negligent\r\n  failure to properly perform such duty renders him liable for injuries\r\n  proximately caused as a consequence.Â  Nelson v. Coleman Co., 249 S.C.\r\n  652, 657, 155 S.E.2d 917, 920 (1967); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10\r\n  (2005) (&quot;One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or\r\n  to his property is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the\r\n  ultimate user or consumer, or to his property . . . .&quot;) (emphasis added).[2]\r\nInitially, the\r\n  trial court did not err in preventing Ford from asking Morrill and Richardson who\r\n  manufactured the switch.Â  As Nelson makes clear, Ford was legally\r\n  responsible for the switch in the event it failed and caused damage because it\r\n  incorporated the switch manufactured by Texas Instruments into its vehicles.Â \r\n  249 S.C. at 657, 155 S.E.2d at 920.Â  Therefore, the fact Texas Instruments\r\n  manufactured the switch was irrelevant.Â  See Rule 611(b), SCRE (&quot;A\r\n  witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any issue in the case .\r\n  . . .&quot;).Â  Next, we believe the trial court acted within its discretion in\r\n  precluding Ford from asking the Duncans' experts why it decided to recall the\r\n  panther platform line of vehicles in 1999.Â  Ford produced no evidence in\r\n  support of its contention that the 1999 recall was prompted by manufacturing\r\n  defects at Texas Instruments either before or during the cross-examination of\r\n  Morrill and Richardson.Â  Because no evidence supported Ford's claim that the\r\n  1999 recall was prompted by manufacturing defects at Texas Instruments, the\r\n  trial court acted within its discretion in preventing Ford from questioning the\r\n  Duncans' experts in that regard.Â  At this point in the trial, Ford's contention\r\n  that manufacturing defects at Texas Instruments caused it to recall vehicles in\r\n  1999 amounted to mere conjecture.Â  See State v. Johnson, 338 S.C.\r\n  114, 124, 525 S.E.2d 519, 524 (2000) (noting a trial court may limit\r\n  cross-examination that is only marginally relevant).Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court acted within its discretion.Â  Â \r\nMoreover, even if\r\n  the trial court committed error, Ford did not suffer any prejudice.Â  See Fields, 363 S.C. at 25, 609 S.E.2d at 509 (holding reversal based on the\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is not warranted absent a showing of both\r\n  error and resulting prejudice).Â  After preventing Ford from cross-examining the\r\n  Duncans' experts about Ford's reason for the 1999 recall, the trial court later\r\n  gave Ford the opportunity to recall Morrill and Richardson to the witness stand\r\n  and ask them about Ford's reason for the 1999 recall.Â  Ford, however, chose not\r\n  to do so.Â  In addition, Ford's expert, Mark Hoffman, testified about the\r\n  manufacturing defects at Texas Instruments as the reason for the 1999 recall.Â \r\n  This was precisely the information Ford sought to elicit from the Duncans'\r\n  experts during cross-examination.Â  See Baber v. Greenville County,\r\n  327 S.C. 31, 41, 488 S.E.2d 314, 320 (1997) (&quot;There is no error in\r\n  excluding testimony which is subsequently admitted into evidence.&quot;); S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Galbreath, 315 S.C. 82, 86, 431\r\n  S.E.2d 625, 628 (Ct. App. 1993) (&quot;Even if the trial court\r\n  erred in excluding evidence, there is no reversible error where the testimony would have been cumulative.&quot;).Â \r\n  Thus, even assuming the trial court committed error in limiting the scope of\r\n  Ford's cross-examination, such error does not warrant reversal on appeal\r\n  because Ford did not suffer any prejudice as a result.Â  \r\nD.Â  1999 Recall of Panther\r\n  Platform Vehicles\r\nFord contends the\r\n  trial court erred by admitting the 1999 recall of the panther platform line of\r\n  vehicles into evidence.Â  Ford asserts the switch failure in the recalled\r\n  panther platform line of vehicles was not substantially similar to the alleged\r\n  switch failure in the Duncans' Expedition.Â  Ford argues the switch failure and\r\n  subsequent recall of the 1999 panther platform line of vehicles was due to\r\n  manufacturing deviations at Texas Instruments.Â  By contrast, Ford asserts the\r\n  Duncans' Expedition contained a switch meeting Ford's specifications.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThe trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion by allowing the 1999 recall of the panther platform\r\n  line of vehicles into evidence.Â  Ford concedes the recalled panther platform vehicles\r\n  contained a switch with the same design and same component parts as the switch\r\n  found in the Duncans' Expedition.Â  Moreover, Ford's expert, Mark Hoffman, acknowledged\r\n  Ford recalled the panther platform vehicles because a failure in the kapton seal\r\n  allowed brake fluid to enter the electrical side of the switch.Â  Duncans'\r\n  expert, Jeff Morrill, testified the fire in the Duncans' Expedition started\r\n  because of an identical failure of the kapton seal.Â  These facts demonstrate that\r\n  the under-hood fires that prompted the 1999 recall of the panther platform line\r\n  of vehicles were substantially similar to the under-hood fire in the Duncans'\r\n  Expedition, which caused their home to be destroyed.Â  See Whaley v.\r\n    CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 483, 609 S.E.2d 286, 300 (2005) (noting\r\n  other incidents must be substantially similar to be relevant and admissible in\r\n  a products liability action).Â Â  \r\nE.Â  Emotional\r\n  Distress\r\nFord argues the\r\n  trial court erred by submitting Anna Duncan's claim for emotional distress to\r\n  the jury in the absence of expert testimony.Â  In addition, Ford contends the\r\n  trial court erred by charging the jury that the &quot;plaintiffs&quot; may\r\n  recover for emotional distress when only Anna presented evidence of emotional\r\n  distress.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nExclusive of the Duncans' claim for emotional distress, Jerry Duncan testified that they\r\n  sustained $627,958.59 in actual damages.[3]Â \r\n  The jury awarded the Duncans $620,759.79 in actual damages.Â  Therefore, because\r\n  the jury verdict is less than the evidence of actual damages presented at\r\n  trial, the verdict should not be disturbed on appeal.Â  See Burns v.\r\n    Universal Health Servs., Inc., 361 S.C. 221, 232, 603 S.E.2d 605, 611 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004) (stating the verdict will be upheld if any evidence sustains the\r\n  factual findings implicit in the jury's verdict).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nF.&nbsp; Threadgill\r\n  Appraisal\r\nFord contends the\r\n  trial court abused its discretion by not admitting Jack Threadgill's appraisal\r\n  of the Duncans' home into evidence because it qualified as a business record.[4]Â \r\n  At a minimum, Ford argues Threadgill's appraisal should have been admissible to\r\n  impeach Keith Ridgeway's appraisal of the Duncans' home because Ridgeway relied\r\n  on the factual information of Threadgill's appraisal.[5]Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nA report kept in\r\n  the course of regularly conducted business activity is admissible unless the\r\n  source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate\r\n  lack of trustworthiness.Â  Rule 803(6), SCRE.Â  However, subjective opinions and\r\n  judgments found in business records are not admissible.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion by excluding Threadgill's appraisal of the Duncans'\r\n  home.Â  Ford only sought to introduce the document to show the value Threadgill\r\n  assigned to the home.Â  The business records exception does not allow subjective\r\n  opinions to be introduced into evidence.Â  Threadgill's valuation of the Duncans'\r\n  home was nothing more than a subjective opinion.Â  In the alternative, Ford argues\r\n  the objective factual portions of Threadgill's appraisal should have been\r\n  admissible at trial.Â  However, Ford never sought to introduce the factual\r\n  portions of Threadgill's appraisal at trial; rather, Ford only sought to admit\r\n  Threadgill's estimate of the value of the Duncans' home.Â  Accordingly, Ford's\r\n  argument concerning the factual portions of the Threadgill appraisal is not\r\n  preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356\r\n  S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (stating issues not raised and\r\n  ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal).Â Â  \r\nII.Â  PUNITIVE DAMAGES\r\nA.Â  Reckless,\r\n  Willful, or Wanton Conduct \r\nFord\r\n  contends the jury's award of punitive damages should be reversed because its\r\n  conduct did not rise to the level of reckless, willful, or wanton.Â  Ford\r\n  contends it had no notice that switches meeting its manufacturing\r\n  specifications would cause fires.Â  Ford argues the Duncans' Expedition, unlike\r\n  the recalled panther platform line of vehicles, contained a properly\r\n  manufactured switch.Â  Although Ford acknowledges the recalled panther platform\r\n  line of vehicles contained a switch matching the same design and containing the\r\n  same component parts as the switch in the Duncans' Expedition, it asserts that\r\n  the fires under the hood of the panther platform line of vehicles were caused\r\n  by deviations in the manufacturing process at Texas Instruments.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  South Carolina law, punitive damages may be awarded to punish tortfeasors who\r\n  have acted in a &quot;reckless, willful, or wanton&quot; manner.Â  Taylor v.\r\n    Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 221, 479 S.E.2d 35, 46 (1996).Â  The plaintiff must\r\n  prove punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-33-135 (2005).Â  Clear and convincing evidence is: Â &quot;that\r\n  degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts\r\n  a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established.&quot;Â  Anderson\r\n    v. Augusta Chronicle, 355 S.C. 461, 473, 585 S.E.2d 506, 512 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003).Â  The clear and convincing standard is the highest burden of proof known\r\n  to civil law.Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298,\r\n  313, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â  \r\nClear and\r\n  convincing evidence supports the jury's award of punitive damages.Â  Here, Ford\r\n  knew the kapton seal it installed in automobiles could fail and that such\r\n  failure was causing fires before manufacturing the Duncans' Expedition in\r\n  December 1999.Â  Shortly after recalling the panther platform line of vehicles\r\n  in May 1999, Ford assigned a group of scientists to investigate the cause of\r\n  the under-hood fires in the panther platform vehicles.Â  The scientists detailed\r\n  their findings in the SIT Report, dated June 11, 1999, and identified the\r\n  failure of the kapton seal to prevent brake fluid from penetrating it as a\r\n  potential cause of the fires.Â  Ford argues manufacturing deviations at Texas\r\n  Instruments prompted the 1999 recall and caused the kapton seal to fail.Â \r\n  However, Ford never produced any document and only one witness, a mechanical\r\n  engineer at Ford, to support this claim.Â  In fact, the SIT Report never\r\n  mentioned the manufacturing problems at Texas Instruments.Â  Thus, the evidence\r\n  clearly demonstrates Ford had knowledge, as of June 11, 1999, the kapton seal could\r\n  fail and that this failure could cause fires.Â  In spite of this knowledge, Ford\r\n  did not make any changes to the switch itself or to the kapton seal; in fact,\r\n  Ford installed a switch in the Duncans' Expedition in December 1999 that was\r\n  virtually identical to that previously installed in the recalled vehicles.[6]Â \r\n  This conduct rises to the level of reckless, willful, and wanton. \r\nB.Â  Jury\r\n  InstructionsÂ Â Â Â  \r\nFord argues the\r\n  trial court should have instructed the jury not to consider conduct occurring\r\n  outside of South Carolina or harm to non-parties when deciding whether to award\r\n  punitive damages.Â  Ford contends evidence of two nationwide recalls created a\r\n  risk that the jury might award punitive damages to the Duncans on these\r\n  improper bases.Â  We disagree. \r\n&quot;The\r\n  practice of awarding punitive damages originated in principles of criminal law\r\n  to deter the wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses in the future.&quot;Â  James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 193, 638 S.E.2d 667, 670\r\n  (2006) (citing Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 393, 134\r\n  S.E.2d 206, 210 (1964)).Â  Because of the quasi-criminal nature of punitive\r\n  damages, the process of assessing punitive damages is subject to the\r\n  protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United\r\n  States Constitution.Â  Atkinson v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 361 S.C. 156,\r\n  164, 604 S.E.2d 385, 389 (2004).Â  The United States Supreme Court has\r\n  interpreted the Due Process Clause to prohibit a state from imposing punitive\r\n  damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of the state's\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408,\r\n  421 (2003).Â  &quot;[T]he Constitution's Due Process Clause forbids a State to\r\n  use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts\r\n  upon non-parties or those whom they directly represent . . . .&quot;Â  Philip\r\n    Morris v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 353 (2007).Â  When the evidence and\r\n  arguments submitted in the case create a risk of improper punishment, the trial\r\n  court must, upon request, properly instruct the jury on the constitutional\r\n  limits of punitive damages.Â  Id. at 357.\r\nNeither the\r\n  evidence nor the arguments in this case necessitated the jury charge argued by\r\n  Ford.Â  The Due Process Clause does not require the jury charge advanced by\r\n  Ford.Â  The Due Process Clause only requires such a charge when the evidence or\r\n  arguments presented at trial create a risk that the jury may award punitive\r\n  damages for conduct occurring outside of the state or for harm to non-parties.Â  Id. at 357.Â  Contrary to Ford's assertions, the Duncans did not\r\n  introduce evidence creating such a risk.Â  The Duncans introduced the 1999\r\n  recall solely for the purpose of demonstrating Ford's knowledge of the\r\n  defective kapton seal at the time it installed the same kapton seal in the\r\n  Duncans' Expedition.Â  In addition, the Duncans introduced the 2005 recall of\r\n  the Ford Expedition to demonstrate that the recall was due to the same failure\r\n  of the kapton seal that the Duncans claimed caused the fire in their\r\n  Expedition.Â  As the United States Supreme Court stated in TXO Prod. Corp. v.\r\n    Alliance Res. Corp., a plaintiff can introduce evidence of out-of-state\r\n  conduct to demonstrate the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's\r\n  conduct.Â  509 U.S. 443, 462 n.28 (1993).Â  Simply put, the Duncans only\r\n  introduced evidence of nationwide recalls to demonstrate the reckless or\r\n  willful nature of Ford's conduct in this case.Â  The Duncans never offered any\r\n  evidence of how many automobiles Ford recalled or how many injuries the\r\n  under-hood fires caused.Â  Accordingly, the Due Process Clause did not require\r\n  the jury charge suggested by Ford.Â  \r\nC.Â  Ford's WealthÂ  Â Â Â \r\nAt trial, the Duncans called Dr. Oliver Wood to testify about Ford's general wealth and its financial\r\n  ability to respond to an award of punitive damages.Â  During his testimony, Wood\r\n  testified as to Ford's net worth, assets, gross profits, and the amount of\r\n  compensation it paid executives.Â  Ford argues the trial court should not have\r\n  allowed Wood to testify because his testimony invited the jury to return an\r\n  award of punitive damages against it based solely on its financial well-being.[7]Â \r\n  In particular, Ford argues the amount of compensation it paid executives lacked\r\n  any relationship to its financial ability to respond to punitive damages and\r\n  was nothing more than a transparent attempt to appeal to the jury's passion.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Frazier\r\n  v. Badger, the South Carolina Supreme Court reaffirmed the proposition that\r\n  a defendant's ability to pay is a relevant factor in assessing punitive\r\n  damages.Â  361 S.C. 94, 106, 603 S.E.2d 587, 593 (2004) (citing Rogers v.\r\n    Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 106 S.E.2d 258 (1958)).Â  In Pac.\r\n      Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, the United States Supreme Court stated the &quot;financial\r\n  position&quot; of the defendant is one factor that can be taken into account in\r\n  assessing punitive damages.Â  499 U.S. 1, 20 (1991).Â  However, the Supreme Court\r\n  later acknowledged that evidence of a defendant's wealth creates the potential\r\n  that juries will use their verdicts to compensate plaintiffs in an arbitrary\r\n  fashion.Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 417; see also BMW of N. Am.,\r\n    Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 562 (1996) (&quot;The Due Process Clause of the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.&quot;). \r\nThe trial court\r\n  properly allowed Wood to testify about Ford's ability to respond to a punitive\r\n  damages award.Â  During his testimony, Wood testified beyond the mere net worth\r\n  of Ford and informed the jury of Ford's\r\n  assets, gross profits, and the amount of compensation it paid executives.Â \r\n  Appellate courts in our state have allowed testimony beyond a defendant's mere\r\n  net worth to establish its ability to pay a punitive damages award.Â  SeeÂ  Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 170, 536 S.E.2d 380, 386 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (allowing testimony of the defendant's assets, liabilities, net\r\n  worth, shareholders' equity, operating revenue, and net income per day to\r\n  establish whether the defendant could pay punitive damages).Â  In addition, Wood's\r\n  testimony concerning the state of Ford's economic affairs allowed the jury to\r\n  follow the instructions of the trial court and &quot;punish the defendant but\r\n  not [e]ffect economic bankruptcy.&quot;Â  Therefore, the trial court properly\r\n  allowed Wood to testify about Ford's ability to pay punitive damages and such\r\n  testimony did not offend the Due Process Clause.[8]Â  \r\nD.Â  The\r\n  Gore Guideposts[9]\r\nThere\r\n  are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on the award of\r\n  punitive damages.Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 416.Â  In Gore, the United\r\n  States Supreme Court identified three guideposts to be considered when\r\n  analyzing whether a punitive damage award is unconstitutionally excessive:Â  (1)\r\n  the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct; (2) the ratio between the\r\n  punitive damages award and the plaintiff's harm as measured by compensatory\r\n  damages; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed\r\n  in comparable cases.Â  517 U.S. at 575-83.Â  \r\n1.Â  Reprehensibility\r\n  of Ford's ConductÂ Â Â  \r\nThe principle that\r\n  punishment should fit the crime is deeply rooted in common-law jurisprudence.Â  Id. at 576 n.24.Â  Likewise, the amount of punitive damages imposed on a defendant\r\n  should reflect &quot;the enormity of his offense.&quot;Â  Id. at 575.Â \r\n  The Supreme Court has stated that &quot;punitive damages should only be awarded\r\n  if the defendant's culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so\r\n  reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve\r\n  punishment or deterrence.&quot;Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 419.Â  The Supreme\r\n  Court has instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant's\r\n  conduct by considering whether: \r\n\r\n\tthe\r\n  harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced\r\n  an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others;\r\n  the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved\r\n  repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of\r\n  intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nId.Â  In Campbell, the Court went on to state &quot;[t]he existence of any one of these\r\n  factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a\r\n  punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award\r\n  suspect.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe conduct in this\r\n  case caused only economic harm as the fire destroyed the Duncans' home and all\r\n  of their personal possessions.Â  Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of\r\n  Ford.Â  However, the fact that the conduct in question caused economic, rather than\r\n  physical, harm does not end our inquiry.[10]Â \r\n  As the Supreme Court stated in Gore, &quot;infliction of economic\r\n  injury, especially when done intentionally through affirmative acts of\r\n  misconduct, or when the target is financially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial\r\n  penalty.&quot;Â  517 U.S. at 576.Â  Accordingly, we continue our analysis.Â  Â \r\nMoving forward, we\r\n  find Ford acted with reckless disregard for the health and safety of others by\r\n  installing a switch in the Duncans' Expedition, which it knew could fail and\r\n  cause fires.Â  The facts of this case reveal that Ford knew two things before\r\n  manufacturing the Duncans' Expedition in December 1999.Â  First, as evidenced by\r\n  the May 1999 recall of the panther platform line of vehicles, Ford knew its\r\n  vehicles possessed a propensity to cause under-hood fires.Â  Second, as\r\n  evidenced by the SIT Report, dated June 11, 1999, Ford knew a potential cause\r\n  of the fires was the failure of the kapton seal to prevent brake fluid from\r\n  entering the electrical side of the switch.Â  Nonetheless, Ford took no steps to\r\n  remedy the problem before manufacturing the Duncans' Expedition.[11]Â \r\n  Instead, when Ford manufactured the Duncans' Expedition, it installed a switch\r\n  matching the same design and containing the same component parts as the\r\n  recalled panther platform line of vehicles.Â  In short, Ford installed a switch\r\n  into the Duncans' Expedition that it knew could cause fires.[12]Â \r\n  This conduct clearly amounts to a reckless disregard for the health and safety\r\n  of others.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nIn addition, Ford\r\n  did not simply install a rogue switch in the Duncans' Expedition which failed\r\n  and caused the vehicle to ignite into flames.Â  Rather, Ford displayed a pattern\r\n  of installing switches in its automobiles that caused fires.Â  See id. at 577 (&quot;Our holdings\r\n  that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender recognize\r\n  that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an\r\n  individual instance of malfeasance.&quot;).Â  This fact is clearly demonstrated by Ford's recall of the panther\r\n  platform line of vehicles.Â  In May 1999, Ford recalled the panther platform\r\n  line of vehicles because of under-hood fires.Â  One month later, in the SIT\r\n  Report, a group of scientists at Ford identified a defective switch as a\r\n  potential cause of the fires.Â  However, as mentioned above, Ford did nothing to\r\n  cure the defect in the switches.Â  In fact, the same defect that caused fires\r\n  under the hood of the recalled panther platform vehiclesâ€”the failure of the\r\n  kapton seal to prevent brake fluid from entering the electrical side of the\r\n  switchâ€”also caused the fire under the hood of the Duncans' Expedition.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Ford repeatedly installed a defective switch in its automobiles;\r\n  in turn, the same defect in the switch itself caused fires both in the recalled\r\n  panther platform line of vehicles and the Duncans' Expedition.Â Â  \r\nLastly, we find the\r\n  harm in this case was not the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit.[13]Â \r\n  That being said, the harm was not the result of a mere accident at Ford.Â  To\r\n  the contrary, the evidence demonstrates Ford installed a defective switch in\r\n  the Duncans' Expedition with the knowledge that the switch could fail and cause\r\n  fires.Â  In analyzing this factor of reprehensibility, we are cognizant of the\r\n  fact that an award of punitive damages may not be &quot;grossly out of\r\n  proportion to the severity of the offense.&quot;Â  Id. at 576.Â  While\r\n  Ford's conduct did not rise to the level of intentional malice, trickery, or\r\n  deceit, Ford's act of installing a switch in the Duncans' Expedition that it\r\n  knew could cause fires amounts to affirmative misconduct.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  considering all of the aggravating factors associated with reprehensible\r\n  conduct as set forth in Campbell, we conclude that Ford's installation\r\n  of a defective switch in the Duncans' Expedition:Â  evidenced a reckless\r\n  disregard for the health and safety of others; displayed a pattern of\r\n  installing switches in its automobiles that caused fires; and amounted to\r\n  affirmative misconduct.Â  Accordingly, we find Ford engaged in sufficiently\r\n  reprehensible conduct so as to justify the jury's award of three million dollars\r\n  in punitive damages.Â Â Â  Â \r\n2.Â  Reasonableness of Punitive Damages Award\r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court has refused to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio\r\n  between punitive and actual damages.Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 582.Â  However, the Supreme Court has consistently pointed out\r\n  that a reasonable relationship between punitive and actual damages must exist.Â  Id. at 580.Â  The Court has stated &quot;in\r\n  practice few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and\r\n  compensatory damages will satisfy due process.&quot;Â  Campbell, 538 U.S.\r\n  at 425.Â  Simply put, &quot;single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport\r\n  with due process, while still achieving the State's goals of deterrence and\r\n  retribution . . . .&quot;Â  Id. \r\nThe\r\n  reasonableness of a punitive damages award cannot be determined simply by\r\n  examining the relationship between the punitive damages award and the actual\r\n  damages award.Â  See Gore, 517 U.S. at 582 (&quot;[W]e have consistently rejected the\r\n  notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula\r\n  . . . .&quot;).Â  As the Supreme Court has made clear, the potential\r\n  harm the defendant's conduct could have caused the plaintiff may also be\r\n  considered.Â  Williams, 549 U.S. at 354; See Gore, 517 U.S.\r\n  at 581 (&quot;[T]he proper inquiry is whether there is a reasonable\r\n  relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant's\r\n  conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred.&quot;) (emphasis in\r\n  original) (quoting Haslip, 499 U.S. at 21).Â  In the end, a general\r\n  concern of reasonableness drives our inquiry.Â  TXO, 509 U.S. at 458. \r\nIn\r\n  light of the harm caused by Ford's conduct, and the potential harm Ford's\r\n  conduct could have caused to the Duncans, we find the punitive damages award in\r\n  this case was reasonable.Â  In this case, the Duncans sustained a significant\r\n  economic loss as a result of Ford's conduct.Â  Ford's installation of a\r\n  defective switch in the Duncans' vehicle caused the vehicle to ignite into\r\n  flames.Â  The resulting fire destroyed the Duncans' home along with all of their\r\n  personal possessions.Â  Aside from the actual harm suffered by the Duncans, Ford's\r\n  conduct threatened to inflict\r\n  serious physical injury to the Duncans as well.Â  With these considerations in\r\n  mind, we hold the jury's award of punitive damages, amounting to 5.087 times\r\n  the actual damages awarded in this case, was reasonable.[14]Â  \r\n3.Â  Comparable Civil FinesÂ  \r\nAppellate courts must compare the punitive damages award with the\r\n  civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.[15]Â Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 583.Â  In\r\n  doing so, reviewing courts &quot;should accord substantial deference to legislative judgments\r\n  concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.&quot; Â Id.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the Duncans were awarded three million dollars in punitive damages.Â  The South\r\n  Carolina legislature has not adopted legislation that levies fixed civil fines\r\n  against automobile manufacturers for the manufacturer of vehicles with\r\n  defective parts.Â  Our state's general products liability statute is the closest\r\n  piece of legislation contemplating the factual scenario before us.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 15-73-10 (2005).Â  It is of very little aid in our analysis because it does\r\n  not fix civil fines; rather, it merely imposes &quot;liability&quot; on\r\n  manufacturers who sell products in a defective condition.Â  Id.Â  Under\r\n  federal law, an automobile manufacturer that violates a safety standard, a\r\n  recall procedure, or manufactures a defective vehicle is liable to the federal\r\n  government for a civil penalty of no more than $5,000 for each violation, with\r\n  the maximum penalty not to exceed $15 million.Â  49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 30165(a)(1) (West.\r\n  2005).Â  \r\nIn previous cases,\r\n  our appellate courts have faced similar problems when attempting to compare the\r\n  punitive damages award with possible civil fines that could be imposed against\r\n  the defendant for similar misconduct.Â  In Collins, this court observed\r\n  there were no &quot;legislative\r\n  judgments imposing civil or criminal penalties&quot; for the conduct in\r\n  question.Â  355 S.C. at 142, 584 S.E.2d at\r\n  129.Â  Likewise, in James, our supreme court noted the applicable statutes imposed\r\n  civil fines not to exceed $30,000 for each violation.Â  371 S.C. at 197, 368 S.E.2d at 672.Â  In both cases,\r\n  our appellate courts affirmed a punitive damages award exceeding the ratio\r\n  between punitive and actual damages present in this case.Â  See id. at 196, 638 S.E.2d at 672 (upholding a punitive damages award 6.82 times the\r\n  actual damages award); Collins, 355 S.C. at 141, 584 S.E.2d at 129\r\n  (affirming punitive damages award that was 10 times the amount of the actual\r\n  damages award).Â  In doing so, both cases stated &quot;the statutory penalties are set at such a\r\n  low level, there is little basis for comparing it with any meaningful punitive\r\n  damage award.&quot;Â  James, 371 S.C. at 197, 368 S.E.2d at 672; Collins,\r\n  355 S.C. at 142, 584 S.E.2d at 129.Â  The applicable civil fines in this case\r\n  lead us to the same conclusion.Â  After reviewing the guideposts established by\r\n  the Supreme Court in Gore, we find the jury's award of three million dollars\r\n  in punitive damages was not unconstitutionally excessive.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of the trial court's ruling, both\r\n  parties acknowledged that Ford, not Texas Instruments, was liable for the\r\n  defective switch after installing it into its vehicles.Â  In addition, neither\r\n  party had introduced evidence of manufacturing problems at Texas Instruments.Â  \r\n[2] For liability to attach under the statute, the seller\r\n  must also be in the business of selling the defective product, and the product\r\n  must be expected to and ultimately reach the consumer without a substantial\r\n  change in condition.Â  Â§ 15-73-10 (2005).Â Â  Â Â \r\n[3] $440,000 for the house, $156,120.32 for personal\r\n  items, $21,000 for the use of the house, $9,734.47 for landscaping, $898.80 in\r\n  hotel stays, and $205.00 electrician fees.Â Â  \r\n[4] Â Threadgill was deceased at the time of the trial.\r\n[5] Threadgill valued the Duncans' home at $251,415.00,\r\n  while Ridgeway valued it at $295,711.00.\r\n[6] Ford repeatedly argues the SIT Report is being\r\n  read out of context.Â  However, the document is straight-forward.Â  It\r\n  establishes potential causes of the under-hood fires and offers solutions on\r\n  how to fix them.Â  According to the report, one of the two causes of the fires\r\n  is the failure of the kapton seal.Â Â  \r\n[7] Ford offered to stipulate that it had the ability to\r\n  pay an award of punitive damages.\r\n[8] We note this issue may not be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.Â  Prior to Wood's testimony, Ford asked the court to prevent Wood from\r\n  testifying about Ford's wealth.Â  The trial court denied Ford's request, stating\r\n  &quot;I will allow him to testify as to [the] ability [of] Ford . . . to pay a\r\n  punitive damages award.&quot;Â  However, the trial court informed Ford\r\n  &quot;I'll just have to deal with his testimony on any objections you may have\r\n  . . .Â  because I think some of it is probably appropriate and some of it is\r\n  probably not.&quot;Â  When Wood testified in regards to Ford's wealth, Ford\r\n  failed to object.Â  See State v. Kirton, 381 S.C. 7, 43, 671\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 125 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;To preserve an issue for review there\r\n  must be a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court.&quot;).Â  \r\n[9] We find the trial court conducted a proper post-trial\r\n  review of the punitive damages award pursuant to Gamble v. Stevenson,\r\n  305 S.C. 104, 111-12, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991).Â  The Gamble factors\r\n  include:Â  (1) defendant's degree of culpability; (2) duration of the\r\n  conduct; (3) defendant's awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar\r\n  past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from\r\n  like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to\r\n  result from such conduct; (7) defendant's ability to pay; and (8) other factors\r\n  deemed appropriate.Â  Id.Â  \r\n[10] Appellate courts in this state have allowed\r\n  plaintiffs to recover punitive damages when the defendant's conduct caused only\r\n  economic harm.Â  James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 196, 638\r\n  S.E.2d 667, 672 (2006); Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 203-04, 608 S.E.2d\r\n  129, 130 (2005); Collins Entm't Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental Amusement,\r\n  355 S.C. 125, 141, 584 S.E.2d 120, 129 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Â \r\n[11] The SIT Report proposed ten solutions to remedy the\r\n  under-hood fires.Â  Ford failed to implement any of the proposed solutions in\r\n  the report.Â  \r\n[12] Ford argues it did not know switches manufactured to\r\n  its specifications could fail and cause fires.Â  In order to accept Ford's\r\n  argument, we would have to agree with Ford that the 1999 recall and the\r\n  under-hood fires in the panther platform line of vehicles were the result of\r\n  manufacturing deviations at Texas Instruments.Â  As we have stated throughout\r\n  this opinion, Ford simply failed to demonstrate this at trial.Â Â Â  \r\n[13] The financial vulnerability of the Duncans is not\r\n  appropriate to consider in determining the reprehensibility of Ford in this\r\n  case.Â  The inapplicability of this factor to the case before us does not weigh\r\n  in favor of Ford or against the Duncans in our analysis.Â  \r\n[14] Appellate courts in this state have affirmed punitive\r\n  damage awards exceeding the ratio in this case.Â  See James, 371\r\n  S.C. at 196, 638 S.E.2d at 672 (upholding a punitive damages award 6.82 times\r\n  the actual damages award); Collins Entm't, 355 S.C. at 141, 584 S.E.2d\r\n  at 129 (affirming punitive damages award that was ten times the amount of the\r\n  actual damages award).Â Â  \r\n[15] More recently, the Supreme Court has questioned the\r\n  utility of considering criminal penalties when determining monetary awards.Â  Campbell,\r\n  538 U.S. at 428.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4608","title":"Hackworth v.

Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 499,\r\n  478 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A motion to strike that challenges a\r\n  theory of recovery in the pleading is in the nature of a motion to dismiss\r\n  under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  McCormack v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 632,\r\n  494 S.E.2d 431, 433 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A ruling on a motion to dismiss a claim\r\n  must be based solely on the allegations set forth on the face of the claim.Â  Id. at 632-33, 494 S.E.2d at 433.Â  The motion cannot be sustained if the acts\r\n  alleged and the inferences reasonably deductible therefrom would entitle the\r\n  plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.Â  Id. at 633, 494\r\n  S.E.2d at 433.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  tort of civil conspiracy has three elements: (1) a combination of two or more\r\n  persons, (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, and (3) causing\r\n  plaintiff special damage.Â  Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 208, 387\r\n  S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  The difference between civil and criminal\r\n  conspiracy is in criminal conspiracy, the gravamen of the offense is the\r\n  agreement itself, whereas in civil conspiracy, the gravamen of the tort is the\r\n  damage resulting to plaintiff from an overt act done pursuant to a common\r\n  design.Â  Id.; see also Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 567-68, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006) (&quot;The gravamen of the tort of\r\n  civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the plaintiff from an overt act\r\n  done pursuant to the combination, not the agreement or combination per se.&quot;).Â  \r\nA\r\n  claim for civil conspiracy must allege additional acts in furtherance of a\r\n  conspiracy rather than reallege other claims within the complaint.Â  Todd v.\r\n    S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 284, 293, 278 S.E.2d 607, 611 (1981) rev'd on other grounds, 283 S.C. 155, 321 S.E.2d 602 (1984) quashed\r\n      in part on other grounds, 287 S.C. 190, 336 S.E.2d 472 (1985).Â  Moreover, because\r\n  the quiddity of a civil conspiracy claim is the special damage resulting to the\r\n  plaintiff, the damages alleged must go beyond the damages alleged in other\r\n  causes of action. Â Vaught, 300 S.C. at 209, 387 S.E.2d at 95.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Additional Acts in\r\n  Furtherance of the Conspiracy \r\nAn\r\n  unexecuted civil conspiracy is not actionable.Â  Charles v. Tex. Co., 199\r\n  S.C. 156, 163, 18 S.E.2d 719, 727 (1942).Â  The conspiracy becomes actionable,\r\n  however, once overt acts occur which proximately cause damage to the\r\n  plaintiff.Â  Todd, 276 S.C. at 292, 278 S.E.2d at 611.Â  In a civil\r\n  conspiracy claim, one must plead additional acts in furtherance of the\r\n  conspiracy separate and independent from other wrongful acts alleged in the\r\n  complaint, and the failure to properly plead such acts will merit the dismissal\r\n  of the claim.Â  See id. at 293, 278 S.E.2d at 611 (dismissing\r\n  plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim because &quot;the [civil conspiracy] action\r\n  does no more than incorporate the prior allegations and then allege the\r\n  existence of a civil conspiracy and pray for damages resulting from the\r\n  conspiracy.Â  No additional acts in furtherance of the conspiracy [were] plead&quot;); Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 611, 538 S.E.2d 15,\r\n  31 (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;Because [the third party plaintiff] . . .\r\n  merely realleged the prior acts complained of in his other causes of action as\r\n  a conspiracy action but failed to plead additional acts in furtherance of the\r\n  conspiracy, he was not entitled to maintain his conspiracy cause of\r\n  action.&quot;); Doe v. Erskine Coll., No. 8:04-23001RBH, 2006 WL\r\n  1473853, at *17 (D.S.C.

Mann,\r\n  39 S.C. 465, 469, 18 S.E. 1, 2 (1893).Â  General damages are inferred by the law\r\n  itself, as they are the immediate, direct, and proximate result of the act\r\n  complained of.Â  Sheek v.

Conspiracy Â§ 33, at 718[2],\r\n  holding &quot;Where the particular acts charged as a conspiracy are the same as\r\n  those relied on as the tortious act or actionable wrong, plaintiff cannot\r\n  recover damages for such act or wrong, and recover likewise on the conspiracy\r\n  to do the act or wrong.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nGreywood\r\n  argues Todd should be overturned because the C.J.S. excerpt cited by our\r\n  Supreme Court in that case does not stand for the proposition that a party\r\n  cannot plead and prove alternative theories of recovery.Â  Greywood reads this excerpt\r\n  to mean only that a party cannot recover monetary damages for both the\r\n  underlying wrong and the conspiracy to commit the wrong.\r\nEven\r\n  though Todd was decided before the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure (the Rules) were in effect, the holding in Todd does not\r\n  prevent a party from pleading alternative theories in cases involving civil\r\n  conspiracy.Â  It simply requires that when a party wishes to assert multiple\r\n  causes of action, including civil conspiracy, it must allege acts in\r\n  furtherance of the conspiracy and special damages that are separate and\r\n  independent of the other acts and damages that underlie the other causes of\r\n  action within the same complaint.Â  See Todd, 276 S.C. at 293, 278\r\n  S.E.2d at 611 (&quot;[T]he [civil conspiracy] action does no more than\r\n  incorporate the prior allegations and then allege the existence of a civil\r\n  conspiracy and pray for damages resulting from the conspiracy.Â  No additional\r\n  acts in furtherance of the conspiracy are [pled].&quot;); Vaught, 300\r\n  S.C. at 208, 387 S.E.2d at 94 (relying on Todd in affirming the trial court's\r\n  holding no conspiracy existed &quot;because Vaught could not predicate his\r\n  conspiracy cause of action on the same facts as his breach of contract\r\n  action&quot;).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the C.J.S. excerpt was not the only basis for our Supreme Court's ruling in Todd.Â \r\n  The Court in Todd held because a conspiracy only becomes actionable\r\n  &quot;once overt acts occur which proximately cause damage to the\r\n  [plaintiff],&quot; it is necessary for the plaintiff to plead special damages\r\n  apart from the damages listed as part of other claims in the complaint.Â  Todd,\r\n  276 S.C. at 292-93, 278 S.E.2d at 611.Â  In this case, Greywood's civil\r\n  conspiracy action merely incorporated the same alleged acts as its breach of\r\n  contract action.Â Â  \r\nGreywood\r\n  also argues Todd and its progeny cannot be good law because Todd was decided prior to the adoption of the Rules in 1985.Â  Specifically, Greywood\r\n  argues because the use of the demurrer was abolished by Rule 7(c), SCRCP, and\r\n  the demurrer was a &quot;critical factor&quot; in Todd, Todd is\r\n  no longer good law.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe\r\n  do not believe the demurrer was critical in Todd such that Todd ceased to be good law after the abolition of the demurrer.Â  In Todd, the\r\n  use of the demurrer as an instrument was not critical to the Supreme Court's\r\n  holding that special damages must arise from the conspiracy and be specifically\r\n  pled.Â  The validity of Todd does not depend on the viability of the\r\n  demurrer because the demurrer was merely the proper instrument at the time for\r\n  dismissing a claim for failure to properly plead the required elements.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A\r\n  &quot;sightline&quot; easement is a triangular-shaped easement which, in this\r\n  case, was to be located on the entrance road to the subdivision so as to allow\r\n  drivers leaving the subdivision a clear view of the traffic on Hammett Road.Â  \r\n[2] The current\r\n  citation for the quoted paragraph of Corpus Juris Secundum used in Todd is 15A C.J.S.

Â The two socialized\r\n  and bought drinks at the bar. Â Before leaving the bar, Koehler became involved\r\n  in a verbal altercation with Holland. Â None of the eyewitnesses could determine\r\n  the subject of the argument, but they all confirmed that there was no physical\r\n  contact between the two men. Â After the argument dissipated, Koehler and Caruthers\r\n  left the bar through the south exit. Â Jeffrey Bennick (Bennick), the bar's\r\n  manager and bartender, witnessed Holland watching Koehler and Caruthers exit.Â  Holland then exited the bar through the north door. Â Bennick and Raphael Walke (Walke)\r\n  followed Koehler and Caruthers to try to prevent another altercation in the\r\n  parking lot. Â Bennick testified that Koehler took off his shirt while facing\r\n  Bennick and Walke, as if preparing for an altercation. Â Bennick assured Koehler\r\n  that nothing was going on and told him to get into his car. Â Koehler and Caruthers\r\n  then proceeded to get into Caruthers' car.\r\nHolland's friend, Carlos\r\n  Adams (Adams), realized that Holland was still agitated over his verbal\r\n  altercation with Koehler, and, therefore, Adams followed Holland out of the bar's\r\n  north door in an attempt to calm him down and determine what was happening. Â According\r\n  to Adams, Holland went to his car, reached inside, and then locked the door. Â He\r\n  then ran toward the passenger side of Caruthers' car, where Koehler was\r\n  sitting. Â At this point, Caruthers was attempting to drive out of the parking lot.\r\n  Â Holland began banging on the car's passenger side window and pulling on the passenger\r\n  door. Â Caruthers testified that Holland was pointing a gun at Koehler through the\r\n  window. Â Bennick never saw a gun, but he testified that the banging on the\r\n  window sounded like metal hitting glass. Â Adams testified that while he did not\r\n  see Holland pull anything out of his car that night, a few weeks earlier Holland had shown him a semi-automatic gun that he had in his car. Â \r\nCaruthers got out of her car and\r\n  went around to the passenger side of the car, yelling for Holland to stop\r\n  hitting her car. Â Holland continued to pull on the passenger door.Â  Both\r\n  Caruthers and Walke tried to pull Holland away from the car, but they were\r\n  unsuccessful.Â  Bennick\r\n  then saw the passenger door open, but he was unsure whether Holland was able to pull\r\n  the door open or whether Koehler opened the door himself. Â Holland and Koehler then\r\n  grabbed each other and locked arms, moving about fifteen to twenty feet away\r\n  from Caruthers' car.Â  According to Bennick, Koehler had his head down at this\r\n  time, while it appeared that Holland was hitting Koehler over the head. Â Then,\r\n  three shots were fired. Â After the third shot, Koehler fell to the ground. Â Holland then ran to his car and drove away. Â Koehler received a gunshot wound to the head\r\n  that led to his death, and Walke received a gunshot wound to his leg.Â  Holland was charged\r\n  with murder, possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime,\r\n  and assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  \r\nCrime scene investigators found\r\n  two shell casings at the scene.Â  South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division\r\n  (SLED) agent David Black determined the shell casings to be 9 mm Luger caliber\r\n  cartridge casings.Â  Agent Black also determined that the same gun fired the two\r\n  casings.Â  Also, the fatal bullet retrieved from Koehler's head was consistent\r\n  with 9 mm Luger caliber bullets. \r\nAt trial, defense counsel\r\n  objected to the State's questioning of Adams about his observation of a weapon\r\n  in Holland's possession weeks prior to the incident.Â  Counsel initially argued\r\n  that the testimony was not relevant, and the trial court overruled the\r\n  objection.Â  After a break in the trial, defense counsel asserted that he was\r\n  making his objection pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, on the ground the testimony's prejudicial\r\n  effect outweighed its probative value.Â  The trial court allowed Adams to answer the question, and Adams testified that a few weeks prior to the incident, Holland had shown him a semi-automatic gun that he kept in his car.Â  \r\nThe trial court also denied\r\n  counsel's request for a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter on the ground\r\n  there was no evidence of sufficient legal provocation.[1]Â \r\n  The jury returned a verdict of guilty for all three charges against Holland, and the trial court denied all of Holland's post-trial motions.Â  The trial court\r\n  sentenced Holland to fifty years of imprisonment for the murder conviction,\r\n  twenty years for the ABIK conviction, concurrent, and five years for possession\r\n  of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, to run consecutively to\r\n  the other sentences.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  1. Did the trial\r\n    court err in refusing the charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter?\r\n  2. Did the trial\r\n    court err in allowing Adams to testify about his observation of a weapon in Holland's possession prior to the incident?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the\r\n  discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not interfere unless the\r\n  rights of the appellant were prejudiced.&nbsp; State v. Bridges, 278\r\n  S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982).&nbsp;Therefore, this Court reviews\r\n  errors of law only and is bound by the trial court's factual determinations\r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.&nbsp; State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41,\r\n  48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Charge on\r\n  Voluntary Manslaughter\r\n Holland asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on voluntary\r\n  manslaughter because the evidence showed he acted in a sudden heat of passion\r\n  upon sufficient legal provocation.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The law to be charged must\r\n  be determined from the evidence presented at trial.&quot;Â  Cole, 338 S.C. at 101, 525 S.E.2d at 512.Â  In\r\n  determining whether the evidence requires a charge of voluntary manslaughter, the Court views the facts in a light\r\n  most favorable to the defendant.Â  State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474 S.E.2d 430, 431&nbsp;(1996).&nbsp; However, &quot;[a]n\r\n  instruction should not be given unless justified by the evidence.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Moultrie, 273 S.C. 532, 534, 257 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1979).Â  &quot;If a jury\r\n  instruction is provided to the jury that does not fit the facts of the case, it\r\n  may confuse the jury.&quot;Â  State v. Blurton, 352 S.C. 203,\r\n  208, 573 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002).Â  This Court will not reverse the trial court's\r\n  ruling regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\n  Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful\r\n    killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal\r\n    provocation. Â Heat of passion alone will not suffice to reduce murder to\r\n    voluntary manslaughter. Â Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation\r\n    must be present at the time of the killing. Â \r\n\r\nCole,\r\n  338 S.C. at 101, 525 S.E.2d at 513&nbsp;(internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n\r\n  &quot;The sudden heat of passion, upon\r\n    sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing to\r\n    manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge\r\n    and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and\r\n    render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce\r\n    what, according to human experience, may be called\r\n    an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.&quot; \r\n\r\nId. at 101-02, 525\r\n  S.E.2d at 513 (quoting State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474 S.E.2d 430 (1996)). \r\n&quot;[M]ere\r\n  words, no matter how opprobrious, are insufficient to constitute adequate legal\r\n  provocation when death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon.&quot;Â  State v. Rogers,\r\n  320 S.C. 520, 525, 466 S.E.2d 360, 362&nbsp;(1996).Â  Further, merely\r\n  displaying a willingness to fight, unaccompanied by any overt threatening act\r\n  toward a defendant, does not constitute sufficient legal provocation.Â  See State\r\n    v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 40-41,\r\n  476 S.E.2d 681, 682&nbsp;(1996)&nbsp;(holding that the trial judge properly refused to charge voluntary manslaughter despite\r\n  testimony that individuals approached the defendant as they were &quot;trash\r\n  talking&quot; and that one of the individuals removed his hat and &quot;stepped\r\n  out a little bit,&quot; demonstrating a willingness to fight, because there was no evidence that anyone made\r\n  an overt threatening act toward the defendant).\r\nMoreover, &quot;[t]he\r\n  exercise of a legal right, no matter how offensive to another, is never in law\r\n  deemed a provocation sufficient to justify or mitigate an act of\r\n  violence.&quot;Â  State v. Ivey, 325\r\n  S.C. 137, 142, 481 S.E.2d 125, 127&nbsp;(1997).Â  &quot;A victim's\r\n  attempts to resist or defend himself from a crime cannot satisfy the sufficient\r\n  legal provocation element of voluntary manslaughter.&quot;Â  State v. Shuler, 344\r\n  S.C. 604, 632, 545 S.E.2d 805, 819&nbsp;(2001).Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHere, there is\r\n  no evidence, nor any reasonable inferences from the evidence, that at the exact\r\n  moment Holland killed Koehler, Holland's rage was justified by legal provocation.Â  The rage experienced by Holland when he fired the fatal shot had already\r\n  been continuously sustained from the moment of his initial fury during the\r\n  verbal argument inside the bar.Â  Although the argument ended inside the bar, Holland's fury never subsided as he relentlessly pursued a retreating Koehler.Â  Holland saw Koehler and Caruthers leaving through the bar's south exit, and he immediately\r\n  stepped outside through the north exit and went directly to his car to retrieve\r\n  his gun.Â  He then ran\r\n  toward the passenger side of Caruthers' car where Koehler was sitting as Caruthers\r\n  was trying to drive out of the parking lot. Â Holland banged on the car's passenger\r\n  side window, pointed a gun at Koehler, and repeatedly yanked on the passenger door\r\n  to get to Koehler.Â  Holland also rebuffed attempts by Caruthers and Walke to\r\n  stop him from pursuing Koehler.Â  \r\nAt this point, Bennick saw the\r\n  passenger door open, but he was unsure whether Holland was finally able to open\r\n  the door\r\n  or whether Koehler himself opened the door.Â  However, even if Koehler opened\r\n  the door, that act could not be considered sufficient legal provocation because\r\n  it was obvious that Holland wanted to get Koehler out of the vehicle; Holland,\r\n  who was already furious and was armed, was on a mission to inflict harm.Â \r\n  Further, the witnesses' vague characterizations of the\r\n  physical contact between Holland and Koehler as &quot;tussling&quot; and\r\n  &quot;wrestling&quot; does not permit an inference that Koehler threw\r\n  any punches or otherwise posed a genuine threat to\r\n  Holland through any specific, identifiable hostile act.Â  There was\r\n  absolutely no evidence that Koehler did anything to pose\r\n  a genuine threat to the armed and determined Holland. Â \r\nHolland argues that the\r\n  following evidence showed sufficient legal provocation:Â  (1) the argument\r\n  inside the bar; (2) Koehler taking off his shirt in the bar's parking lot; (3) the\r\n  altercation between Holland and Caruthers; and (4) &quot;wrestling&quot;\r\n  between Holland and Koehler when the gunshots were fired.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the argument inside the\r\n  bar was not accompanied by any physical contact between Koehler and Holland or any threatening gestures by Koehler.Â  Therefore, the argument itself could not\r\n  serve as sufficient legal provocation because &quot;mere\r\n  words, no matter how opprobrious, are insufficient to constitute adequate legal\r\n  provocation when death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon.&quot;Â  Rogers,\r\n  320 S.C. at 525, 466 S.E.2d at 362.Â  When &quot;death\r\n  is caused by use of a deadly weapon, the\r\n  offending words must be accompanied by an overt, threatening act.&quot;Â  Id. at 525, 466 S.E.2d at 362-63 (quoting State\r\n    v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 399, 434 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1993) (internal\r\n  quotations omitted)).\r\nFurther, there\r\n  is no evidence, nor any reasonable inferences from the evidence, that Holland saw Koehler remove his shirt in the parking lot.Â  Even if Holland had seen Koehler\r\n  remove his shirt, and even if this was a signal that Koehler was ready for a\r\n  fight, merely displaying a willingness to fight, unaccompanied by any overt\r\n  threatening act toward a defendant, does not constitute sufficient legal\r\n  provocation.Â  See Johnson, 324 S.C. at 40-41,\r\n  476 S.E.2d at 682&nbsp;(holding that the trial judge\r\n  properly refused to charge voluntary manslaughter, despite\r\n  testimony that an individual approached the defendant and demonstrated\r\n  a willingness to fight, because there\r\n  was no evidence of any overt threatening act toward the defendant).\r\nMoreover, evidence\r\n  of the confrontation between Caruthers and Holland could not support a\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge because there is no evidence that she posed a threat\r\n  to Holland either by possessing a weapon or through hostile acts.[2]Â \r\n  Her attempt to pull Holland away from her car as he was trying to open the\r\n  passenger door to get to Koehler was justified and, therefore, did not rise to\r\n  the level of legal provocation.Â  See Ivey, 325 S.C. at 142, 481 S.E.2d at\r\n  127 (&quot;The\r\n  exercise of a legal right, no matter how offensive to another, is never in law\r\n  deemed a provocation sufficient to justify or mitigate an act of\r\n  violence.&quot;).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nAdditionally, the &quot;wrestling,&quot;\r\n  as described by one of the witnesses, between Holland and Koehler was initiated\r\n  by Holland and showed nothing more than Koehler's attempt to defend himself\r\n  from Holland's aggression.Â  &quot;The exercise of a legal\r\n  right, no matter how offensive to another, is never in law deemed a provocation\r\n  sufficient to justify or mitigate an act of violence.&quot;Â  Ivey, 325 S.C. at 142, 481 S.E.2d at\r\n  127.Â  &quot;A victim's attempts to resist or defend himself from\r\n  a crime cannot satisfy the sufficient legal provocation element of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.&quot;Â  Shuler, 344\r\n  S.C. at 632, 545 S.E.2d at 819; see also State v. Tyson, 283\r\n  S.C. 375, 379, 323 S.E.2d 770, 772&nbsp;(1984) (holding that the trial court\r\n  properly refused to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter because evidence\r\n  of a struggle as the victim resisted an armed robbery showed that the victim was\r\n  defending himself).Â  \r\nDuring oral\r\n  arguments, Holland's counsel insisted that the instant case is a classic case\r\n  of voluntary manslaughter.Â  In support of his argument, he discussed the following\r\n  cases: Â State v. Knoten,\r\n  347 S.C. 296, 555 S.E.2d 391&nbsp;(2001); State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 434 S.E.2d 272&nbsp;(1993); Carter v. State, 301 S.C. 396, 392 S.E.2d 184&nbsp;(1990), overruled on other\r\n    grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614&nbsp;(1999);\r\n  and State\r\n    v. Gilliam, 296 S.C. 395, 373\r\n  S.E.2d 596&nbsp;(1988).Â  The instant case is clearly distinguishable\r\n  from these cases.Â  Â Â \r\nIn Knoten, one of the\r\n  defendant's statements given to police indicated that the victim cut the\r\n  defendant with a knife and chased him out of her apartment into the frigid\r\n  weather while he was naked and that he reached into his trunk to obtain a metal\r\n  pipe, presumably to defend himself as he went back into the apartment to\r\n  retrieve his clothes.Â  347 S.C. at 303-04, 555 S.E.2d at 395.Â  As\r\n  he entered the apartment, the victim cut him with a knife a second time, and\r\n  the defendant then hit the victim on the head with the metal pipe.Â  347 S.C. at 304-05, 555 S.E.2d at 395-96.Â  Unlike\r\n  the evidence of the victim's second assault of the defendant in Knoten, there\r\n  is simply no evidence in the instant case that any action of Koehler after he\r\n  retreated from the bar precipitated a new provocation rising to the level of\r\n  &quot;legal provocation,&quot; sufficiently distinct from any provocation\r\n  Holland had already experienced inside the bar.Â  \r\nThe facts in the instant case are\r\n  also different from those in Lowry, in which there was testimony that\r\n  the victim moved toward the defendant in a menacing fashion with his arms and\r\n  hands outstretched toward the defendant as if to grab him.Â  315 S.C. at 398, 434 S.E.2d at 273.Â  The Lowry Court stated that this testimony tended to show that the victim was about to initiate a physical encounter when the shooting occurred.Â  315 S.C. at 399, 434\r\n  S.E.2d at 274.Â  There was no testimony in the instant case that\r\n  could be similarly characterized.Â  \r\nIn Carter, the defendant's\r\n  heat of passion was provoked by the victim's striking the defendant and\r\n  forcefully ejecting him from the victim's house.Â  301 S.C. at 397, 392\r\n  S.E.2d at 185.Â  And&nbsp;in Gilliam, the defendant's heat\r\n  of passion was provoked by the victim's firing a gun at the defendant.Â  296 S.C. at 397, 373 S.E.2d at 597. &nbsp;Here, Holland's rage was provoked by a mere verbal argument inside a bar, which does not rise to\r\n  the level of legal provocation.Â  Again, there is no reasonable inference\r\n  of a specific, identifiable hostile act of Koehler that posed a genuine threat\r\n  to Holland. Â The requirement that we view the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the defendant does not allow us to throw out all reason from our\r\n  analysis or to ignore the overwhelming, clear evidence of Holland's mission of\r\n  violence against Koehler&#9472;a state of mind that began before Koehler even\r\n  stepped out of Caruthers' vehicle.Â  Cf. Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage,\r\n    Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 296, 504 S.E.2d 347,\r\n  350&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1998)&nbsp;(&quot;In reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, the appellate court should\r\n  not ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.&quot;).\r\nIn sum, the trial court could\r\n  have determined that based on the lack of evidence of any genuine threat posed\r\n  by Koehler, a charge on voluntary manslaughter would have confused the jury.Â \r\n  Therefore, the trial court properly declined to give this charge.Â  See Blurton,\r\n  352 S.C. at 208, 573 S.E.2d at 804 (&quot;If a jury instruction is provided to the\r\n  jury that does not fit the facts of the case, it may confuse the jury.&quot;); Ivey, 325 S.C. at 142, 481 S.E.2d at 127 (holding that where no\r\n  actions by the victim constitute legal provocation, a charge on voluntary\r\n  manslaughter is not required). Â We find no abuse of discretion.Â \r\n  Therefore, we are unable to reverse on this ground.Â  See Williams,\r\n  367 S.C. at 195, 624 S.E.2d at 445 (holding that this Court will not reverse a\r\n  ruling on a jury instruction unless the trial court abused its discretion). \r\nII. Testimony\r\n  concerning handgun\r\nHolland argues that the trial court erred in allowing Adams to testify about his\r\n  observation of a weapon in Holland's possession prior to the incident because the\r\n  danger of the testimony's undue prejudicial effect outweighed its probative\r\n  value.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 403, SCRE,\r\n  states, &quot;[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value\r\n  is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\r\n  issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of\r\n  time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot;\r\n&quot;Unfair\r\n  prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest [a] decision on an improper\r\n  basis.&quot;Â  State v. Gilchrist, 329\r\n  S.C. 621, 627, 496 S.E.2d 424, 427&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).Â  The determination of whether the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative\r\n  value of evidence must be based on the entire record and will turn on the facts\r\n  of each case.Â  State v. Lyles, 379\r\n  S.C. 328, 338, 665 S.E.2d 201, 206&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2008).Â  \r\nThis Court reviews a\r\n  trial court's decision regarding the admissibility of evidence under Rule 403\r\n  pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and must give great deference to\r\n  the trial court's judgment.Â  State\r\n    v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 358, 543\r\n  S.E.2d 586, 593&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2001), overruled on other grounds byState v. Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494&nbsp;(2005).Â &quot;A trial [court's]\r\n  balancing decision under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate court believes it\r\n  would have decided the matter otherwise due to a differing view of the highly\r\n  subjective factors of the probative value or the prejudice presented by the\r\n  evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 358, 543 S.E.2d at 593-94.Â  The trial court's determination should be reversed only in\r\n  exceptional circumstances.Â  Id. at 357, 543 S.E.2d at 593.&nbsp;Â  \r\nHere, Adams' testimony concerning Holland's storage of a semi-automatic gun in his car within weeks prior to the incident was consistent\r\n  with the ballistic evidence gathered by investigators after the shooting.Â \r\n  Further, it solidified Caruthers' identification of Holland as the person who possessed the weapon used to kill Koehler and injure Walke.Â \r\n  Therefore, Adams' testimony was indispensable in proving\r\n  the elements of all three charges against Hollandâ€”possession of a weapon during\r\n  the commission of a violent crime, murder, and ABIK.Â  The trial court acted\r\n  within its discretion in determining that the probative value of Adams' testimony outweighed any danger that the jury might base its decision on improper\r\n  considerations.Â  See State\r\n    v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 634, 541\r\n  S.E.2d 833, 836&nbsp;(2001) (holding that\r\n  the probative value of a witness' testimony that he knew the defendant\r\n  possessed a nine millimeter pistol, which tended to identify the defendant as\r\n  the possessor of the murder weapon, outweighed any prejudice because the identity\r\n  of the user of the murder weapon was the critical issue at trial).Â  \r\nHolland also argues\r\n  that Adams' testimony was unduly prejudicial because it was evidence of a prior\r\n  bad act, showing Holland as a person of bad character. Â However, he did not\r\n  raise this specific ground before the trial court.Â  Therefore, this specific\r\n  argument is not preserved for this Court's review.Â  See State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5-6, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584&nbsp;(1989) (holding that an\r\n  issue is not preserved for review when a party argues one ground in the trial and then an alternative ground on appeal).Â  \r\nIn any event, there is nothing in\r\n  Adams' testimony concerning the handgun from which the jury could infer a prior\r\n  bad act on Holland's part.Â  The testimony did not indicate that Holland's mere possession of the handgun was illegal, that Holland had used the gun to\r\n  commit any bad acts prior to the incident, or that Holland had a criminal\r\n  record involving weapon-related offenses.Â  Notably, during oral arguments, Holland's counsel conceded that there was no negative inference that could be drawn from\r\n  the mere possession of a weapon unaccompanied by any other act. Â \r\nFurther, even if a prior bad act\r\n  could be inferred from the testimony, this evidence solidified Caruthers' identification of Holland as the person who\r\n  possessed the weapon used to kill Koehler and injure Walke.Â  The probative value of this identification evidence outweighed\r\n  any prejudicial effect.Â  Hence, it was admissible under both Rule 403\r\n  and Rule 404(b), SCRE, which provides that evidence\r\n  of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible to show identity.[3] Â Therefore, Adams' testimony did not constitute improper character evidence.Â  Cf. State v. Dickerson, 341 S.C. 391, 396-97, 535 S.E.2d 119, 121-22&nbsp;(2000)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that a murder defendant's drug use was admissible because the medical examiner's\r\n  testimony connected it to the violent &quot;overkill&quot; nature of the murder,\r\n  which involved multiple stab wounds, and thus it served to identify the defendant\r\n  as the &quot;overkill&quot; murderer). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Holland's conviction\r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] &quot;Voluntary manslaughter is the\r\n  unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient\r\n  legal provocation.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525\r\n  S.E.2d 511, 513&nbsp;(2000).\r\n[2] Cf. State v. Wharton,\r\n  381 S.C. 209, 214-15, 672 S.E.2d 786, 788-89&nbsp;(2009) (holding that there was no evidence of sufficient legal provocation\r\n  on the part of an individual who argued with the defendant because he did not\r\n  pose a threat to the defendant either by possessing a weapon or through hostile\r\n  acts).\r\n[3] Rule 404(b),\r\n  SCRE, states, &quot;[e]vidence of other crimes,\r\n  wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order\r\n  to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show\r\n  motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of\r\n  mistake or accident, or intent.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4577","title":"Butler v.

2) erred in refusing to\r\n  make the reduction in alimony retroactive to the date of the initial filing of\r\n  the action to modify alimony; 3) erred in failing to award the Husband more\r\n  fees and costs; and 4) erred in refusing to eliminate or further reduce the\r\n  requirement of life insurance for alimony payments.Â  Additionally, Husband\r\n  requested the family court detail its consideration of the Wifeâ€™s usufruct\r\n  interest.Â  The family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  decisions from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors\r\n  of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence. Â Semken v. Semken, 379 S.C. 71, 75, 664 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  Although this court may find facts in accordance with our own view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not required to ignore the fact\r\n  that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2008).Â  However,\r\n  â€œ[q]uestions concerning alimony rest with the sound discretion of the [family]\r\n  court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nARGUMENTS/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Failure to Terminate or\r\n  Further Reduce Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to\r\n  terminate alimony.Â  Alternatively, Husband contends the family court erred in\r\n  failing to further reduce alimony.Â  In support of his assertion, Husband notes\r\n  six â€œfundamental errorsâ€ of the family court and discusses each error in turn.Â \r\n  Husband contends these errors viewed alone or cumulatively warrant termination\r\n  of alimony or reversal and remand for a further reduction of alimony.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nA.Â  Wifeâ€™s\r\n  Usufruct Inheritance\r\nHusband and Wife agree\r\n  Wife inherited an undivided, one-third interest in her motherâ€™s estate.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Wife inherited a â€œusufructâ€ interest in her motherâ€™s estate, which is a term of\r\n  art under Louisiana law describing a type of interest in property.Â  The\r\n  interest is similar to the common law â€œlife estate.â€Â  Based on this\r\n  inheritance, Husband contends Wife could use the income from her usufruct\r\n  interest to become self-supporting; thus, the family court erred in failing to\r\n  terminate his alimony payments or alternatively further reduce the payments.Â Â Â  \r\nPermanent, periodic alimony\r\n  is a substitute for support which is normally incidental to the marital\r\n  relationship.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107,\r\n  113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Generally, the purpose of alimony is to place the\r\n  supported spouse, to the extent possible, in the position she enjoyed during\r\n  the marriage.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  However, upon a change in circumstances, the family court may modify\r\n  an alimony obligation.Â  See Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516,\r\n  586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Changes in circumstances must be\r\n  substantial or material to justify modification or termination of an alimony\r\n  award. Â Id. at 519, 586 S.E.2d at 140. Â Moreover, the change in\r\n  circumstances must be unanticipated. Â Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 589,\r\n  594 S.E.2d 171, 174 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThe party seeking modification has the\r\n  burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the unforeseen change\r\n  has occurred.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d 727,729\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nIn his motion for reconsideration, Husband asked the\r\n  family court to detail its consideration of Wifeâ€™s usufruct interest.Â  In\r\n  response, the family court acknowledged Wifeâ€™s entitlement to a usufruct\r\n  interest in her Motherâ€™s estate and asserted it â€œexpressly considered the\r\n  usufruct interest in assessing the value of [Wifeâ€™s] assets.â€ Â Further, the\r\n  family court stated it considered that Wife â€œis not entitled to the\r\n  principal and interest on the usufruct, but could only be granted either\r\n  the principal or the interest in the sole discretion of the Personal\r\n  Representative.â€Â  Moreover, the family court reiterated a statement from its\r\n  first order in the present action by stating:Â  â€œ[i]t is also uncontroverted\r\n  that [Wife] has yet to receive any of that money.â€Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the record, it remains unclear whether Motherâ€™s estate is producing\r\n  income.Â  If earnings are coming in, it is speculative as to what the actual\r\n  earnings are.Â  Husbandâ€™s expert, Max Nathan, testified Wife was entitled to\r\n  income on an ongoing basis.Â  Though Nathan attempted to value Wifeâ€™s interest\r\n  in the estate, he did not testify as to the value of the estateâ€™s earnings.Â \r\n  Without stating any numbers, Nathan mentioned estate property in his testimony\r\n  and stated: â€œItâ€™s rented and itâ€™s got a lease . . . Itâ€™s been collecting rents,\r\n  and she should be getting those rents.â€Â  Accordingly, it would be mere\r\n  speculation for any party to assign value to the estateâ€™s earning potential at\r\n  this point.Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  considering this appeal, we note with interest that Wife has not yet received any\r\n  money from the usufruct inheritance.Â  Wife testified she had made efforts to\r\n  obtain the earnings she is entitled to from her Motherâ€™s estate.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Wife testified:Â  â€œI have asked my [B]rother repeatedly [about the earnings].Â \r\n  He has been very evasive about it . . . He has not been forthcoming, and I have\r\n  -- I tried everything.â€Â  Additionally, Wife testified her Brother told her\r\n  â€œthere was nothing there.â€Â  Patrice Viton, one of Husbandâ€™s experts, also\r\n  indicated Wife had not received any earnings from her usufruct interest.Â \r\n  Additionally, a portion of Wife's Brother's deposition was read into evidence\r\n  during trial proceedings.Â  Wife's Brother replied â€œThatâ€™s correctâ€ when asked:Â \r\n  â€œYou advised that no assets had been distributed to [Wife] from her Motherâ€™s\r\n  estate; is that correct?â€Â  \r\nWe\r\n  recognize the family court reduced Husband's alimony obligation based on the\r\n  inheritance she received from her Father.Â  However, at this point in our review\r\n  of the family court's decision, we are concerned only with whether Wife experienced\r\n  a substantial or material change in circumstances based on the inheritance she\r\n  received from her Mother.Â  As noted above, Husband did not demonstrate that\r\n  Wife received any proceeds from the usufruct trust.Â  Further, it is a matter of\r\n  debate as to when or whether Wife will ever receive proceeds.Â  Not only do we find Wifeâ€™s circumstances unchanged,\r\n  but we believe at the time of the family court's decision Wife had not\r\n  experienced a substantial or material change in\r\n  circumstances with regards to her interest in her Mother's estate. Â Therefore,\r\n  Husband failed to meet his burden under Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511,\r\n  519, 586 S.E.2d 136, 140 (Ct. App. 2003) (requiring changes in circumstances must\r\n  be substantial or material to justify modification or termination of an alimony\r\n  award).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision based on Wifeâ€™s\r\n  unchanged circumstances. [1]Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Husbandâ€™s Ability to Pay\r\nHusband maintains the family court referred to and\r\n  relied upon his ability to pay in refusing to terminate alimony when his\r\n  ability to pay was never an issue in the case.Â  Instead, Husband argues:Â \r\n  &quot;the only issue was whether Wife needed alimony to maintain the marital\r\n  standard of living.&quot;Â  Additionally, Husband contends his ability to pay\r\n  alimony is &quot;not a consideration unless and until the court determines that\r\n  Wife needs alimony.&quot;Â  We disagree and find the family court did not err in\r\n  considering his ability to pay in making its decision.Â  \r\n&quot;Many of the same considerations relevant to the\r\n  initial setting of an alimony award may be applied in the modification context\r\n  as well, including the partiesâ€™ standard of living during the marriage, each\r\n  partyâ€™s earning capacity, and the supporting spouseâ€™s ability to continue to\r\n  support the other spouse.&quot; Â Miles, 355 S.C. at 519, 586 S.E.2d at\r\n  140. Â Per statute, the complete\r\n  list of factors the family court can consider in setting alimony include: (1) duration\r\n  of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3)\r\n  educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning\r\n  potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the\r\n  marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7)\r\n  current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of the parties; (8)\r\n  marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10)\r\n  marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support\r\n  obligations; as well as other factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008).Â  Therefore, the\r\n  family court did not err in considering Husbandâ€™s continued ability to pay\r\n  alimony as one factor in its decision pursuant to Miles and section\r\n  20-3-130(C) (4),(6), and (8) of the South Carolina Code.Â  \r\nC.Â  Wifeâ€™s Extinguished Expenses \r\nHusband contends the family court improperly\r\n  calculated his new alimony obligation by subtracting Wifeâ€™s total monthly expenses\r\n  from her total monthly income.Â  Husband maintains this â€œsimplistic approachâ€\r\n  overlooked Wifeâ€™s reduction in expenses since their divorce agreement, Wifeâ€™s\r\n  improper expenses for alimony purposes, and her substantial assets.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nHusband maintains many of Wifeâ€™s expenses at the time\r\n  of their divorce no longer exist.Â  Specifically, Husband maintains Wife no\r\n  longer has a mortgage payment, a North Carolina property expense, or child\r\n  support expenses.Â  In its order the family court found Wifeâ€™s satisfaction of\r\n  her mortgage obligation was â€œcertainly anticipated by the parties at the time\r\n  of the divorce . . .â€Â  We agree and also believe termination of Wifeâ€™s child\r\n  support obligation and North Carolina property expenses were in the partiesâ€™\r\n  contemplation when they divorced.Â  Based on this contemplation, we find the\r\n  family court did not err in refusing to terminate or further reduce Husbandâ€™s\r\n  alimony obligation based on Wifeâ€™s reduction in expenses.Â  See Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. at 589, 594 S.E.2d at 174 (requiring\r\n  the change in circumstances be unanticipated).Â  Therefore, the family court\r\n  properly considered the expenses and assets of each party in setting Husbandâ€™s\r\n  reduced alimony payment of $5,000 per month.Â  \r\nD.Â  Wifeâ€™s Improper Expenses and Frugal Lifestyle\r\nHusband contends Wifeâ€™s monthly expenses are excessive\r\n  in different sections of his brief.Â  We consolidated his assertions regarding\r\n  Wifeâ€™s expenses here.Â  Under â€œWifeâ€™s Expenses,â€ Husband argues the family court\r\n  erred in calculating his new alimony obligation by considering improper\r\n  expenses of Wife for financial declaration purposes.Â  Later, under â€œWifeâ€™s\r\n  Frugal Lifestyle,â€ Husband maintains Wife does not live a â€œfrugalâ€ lifestyle,\r\n  and Wife should not be allowed to use alimony to avoid becoming self-sufficient,\r\n  especially in light of her net worth.Â  Specifically, Husband maintains he\r\n  should not be responsible for several of Wifeâ€™s expenses including charitable\r\n  donations, contributions to their sonâ€™s medical school tuition, fresh flowers\r\n  and houseplants, household maintenance, and major home repairs.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFrugal or not, Wife is entitled to support which is normally incident to the marital\r\n  relationship. Â Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1988) (â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident\r\n  to the marital relationship.â€).Â  In this regard, Wife\r\n  testified she and Husband â€œalways had a history of donations,â€ and â€œthat has\r\n  been our history, and I continue to do that.â€Â  Furthermore, Wife testified she\r\n  and Husband â€œhad a history of helping our childrenâ€ and that she â€œwanted [their\r\n  son] not to have debt when he graduated.â€Â  Based on Wifeâ€™s testimony and other\r\n  financial considerations, we find the family court did not err in taking Wifeâ€™s\r\n  expenses into account in setting the current alimony obligation.Â  \r\nIn regards to Wifeâ€™s other expenses, including fresh\r\n  flowers and plants, and household maintenance, we do not believe Wifeâ€™s 2005\r\n  financial declaration expenses significantly differ from Wifeâ€™s initial\r\n  financial declaration expenses.Â  In 1995, Wife anticipated spending $1,485 in\r\n  â€œmaintenance,â€ while she estimated spending $1,793.88 in â€œmaintenanceâ€ in her\r\n  2005 financial declaration.Â  Furthermore, many of the same categories listed in\r\n  her initial declaration appear again in her 2005 declaration.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find Husband and Wife anticipated his alimony obligation would go toward many\r\n  of these â€œmaintenanceâ€ items.Â  We also note Wife listed fresh flowers and\r\n  plants in her 1995 financial declaration as well as house painting, maid\r\n  service, yard maintenance, tennis, cosmetics, jewelry, donations, expenses for\r\n  her two sons, and more.Â  Based on Wifeâ€™s detailed list of expenses, and her\r\n  candidness regarding them, again we find Husband anticipated having to continue\r\n  paying such expenses.Â  Furthermore, though Husband argues many of these\r\n  expenses are â€œnot the stuff of alimony,â€ such an assertion is untrue when the\r\n  parties established a certain standard of living during their marriage.Â  Hawley\r\n    v. Hawley, 363 S.C. 318, 323, 610 S.E.2d 309, 312 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œGenerally,\r\n  alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the\r\n  same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.â€) (internal citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not err in calculating\r\n  Husband's new alimony obligation by considering Wife's current expenses for\r\n  financial declaration purposes.Â  \r\nE.Â  Financial\r\n  Declarations of Wife and Net Worth\r\nFinally, Husband maintains the family court relied on incorrect\r\n  financial declarations of Wife.Â  Specifically, Husband contends the family\r\n  court found Wifeâ€™s net worth was $4.3 million, when Wifeâ€™s actual net worth was\r\n  $4.7 million.Â  Husband further discusses Wifeâ€™s net worth and asserts simply\r\n  that Wife is rich, and she could support herself for the rest of her life with\r\n  more than $3 million of â€˜availableâ€™ net worth.â€Â  Though we note Wife and\r\n  Husband both have substantial assets, we disagree with Husband's assertion that\r\n  she should be required to exhaust her net worth so he no longer has to pay\r\n  alimony.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that Husband and Wife have\r\n  substantial assets.Â  In its order, the family court found â€œ[Wife] is not\r\n  required to exhaust her assets over the course of her lifetime to maintain her\r\n  standard of living so that [Husband] can reduce his alimony payments.â€Â \r\n  Further, the family court found Wife believed and practiced never to invade\r\n  principal.Â  Finally, the family court held:Â  â€œ[Wife] has invested her assets\r\n  conservatively and that she has followed the same investment practice of\r\n  conservative investment which she learned from her father and which she and\r\n  [Husband] continued during the course of their marriage and continue today.â€Â  \r\nWe agree with the family court that Wife should not be\r\n  required to change investment strategies or invade her principal so Husband can\r\n  terminate or further reduce his alimony payments.Â  First, the parties\r\n  anticipated the otherâ€™s net worth would grow over time.Â  Penny v. Green,Â \r\n  357 S.C. at 589, 594 S.E.2d at 174 (finding change in circumstances must be\r\n  unanticipated to warrant reduction in alimony).Â  Second, Wife should enjoy a\r\n  position similar to the one she enjoyed when she was married.Â  Hawley v.\r\n    Hawley, 363 S.C. 318, 323, 610 S.E.2d 309, 312 (Ct. App. 2005) (explaining alimony\r\n  should place the supported spouse in the same position enjoyed during the\r\n  marriage).Â  In that regard, Wife should not have to exhaust resources or change\r\n  long-held investment beliefs.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s\r\n  decision on this issue.\r\nII.Â  Relate Back DateÂ  \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in refusing to\r\n  make the reimbursement of alimony relate back to the date of the filing of the\r\n  action.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe family court found alimony should be retroactive to the date\r\n  of the filing of the amended complaint, January 25, 2005.Â  Thus, the family\r\n  court required Wife repay Husband approximately $22,500 by June 30, 2006 based\r\n  on his overpayment.Â  However, later in the same order, the family court ordered\r\n  Wife reimburse Husband $22,500 for the alimony he has paid her for the months\r\n  June 1, 2005 through February 1, 2006, and that the $22,500 be paid on or\r\n  before June 30, 2006.Â  In oral argument, both sides stated it was unclear how\r\n  the family court determined Husband's retroactive alimony obligation.Â  We\r\n  believe the family court made an error regarding the retroactive date of\r\n  alimony and in its calculation of Wife's reimbursement obligation to Husband\r\n  based on his initial filing date and his amended filing date. \r\nHusband filed his initial complaint in the present action on June\r\n  17, 2002.Â  Subsequently, Husband amended\r\n  his complaint on January 25, 2005.Â  Therefore, it is unclear why the family\r\n  court required Wife to reimburse Husband for his overpayment from June 1, 2005\r\n  through February 1, 2006.Â  We remand this issue to the family court for\r\n  clarification and a recalculation of an amount relating back to Husbandâ€™s\r\n  initial filing in June of 2002, or his amended filing date of January 25,\r\n  2005.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Other Issues on\r\n  Appeal\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in refusing to terminate or proportionately\r\n  reduce his obligation to maintain life insurance to secure his alimony\r\n  obligations.Â  Later, in separate arguments, Husband maintains the family court\r\n  erred in refusing to order Wife to pay all fees and costs related to her\r\n  obstructive discovery tactics.Â  Additionally, Husband argues the family court\r\n  erred in refusing to order Wife to pay â€œordinaryâ€ fees and costs Husband\r\n  incurred by successfully litigating this case.Â  These issues are abandoned on\r\n  appeal.Â  Husband cited no statute, rule, or case in support of these arguments\r\n  in either his argument section or his â€œBackground Legal Principlesâ€ section.Â \r\n  Furthermore, he makes conclusory statements without supporting authority.Â \r\n  Therefore, we decline to address these issues on the merits.Â  Bryson v.\r\n    Bryson, 378 S.C. 502, 510, 662 S.E.2d 611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008) (â€œAn issue\r\n  is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument is\r\n  raised in a brief but not supported by authority.â€); see also Glasscock,\r\n    Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œ[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting\r\n  authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for\r\n  review.â€). Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court did not err in refusing to terminate or alternatively\r\n  reduce Husband's alimony obligations based on changed circumstances.Â  However,\r\n  we believe the family court erred in calculating Wife's reimbursement\r\n  obligation to Husband; accordingly, we remand this issue back to the family\r\n  court for a recalculation setting forth the appropriate dates and amounts with\r\n  specific findings of facts and conclusions of law.Â  All other issues raised to this court are abandoned on\r\n  appeal.Â  The decision of the family court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHUFF and THOMAS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Husband cited Sharps v. Sharps, 342\r\n  S.C. 71, 535 S.E.2d 913 (2000), for the proposition that in considering\r\n  requests to modify alimony, the family court should consider not only whether\r\n  the alleged change was contemplated but also whether the original alimony award\r\n  reflected the expectation of that future occurrence. Â However, we need not\r\n  reach this question because Wife has not experienced a substantial change in\r\n  circumstances at this time.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4610","title":"Milliken & Company v.

(2) breach of contract (covenant not to compete); (3)\r\n  breach of contract (confidentiality provision); (4) misappropriation of trade\r\n  secrets; (5) unfair trade practices; (6) breach of the implied covenant of good\r\n  faith and fair dealing; (7) breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act;\r\n  (8) conversion; and (9) breach of the duty of loyalty.Â  The causes of action\r\n  for conversion and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act\r\n  were the only causes of action against both Morin and Innegrity.Â  In his Answer\r\n  to Milliken's Amended Complaint, Morin asserted nine defenses including claims\r\n  that the Agreement was unenforceable and was void under public policy.Â  Morin\r\n  filed an Amended Answer, asserting five counterclaims: (1) breach of contract;\r\n  (2) breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act; (3) breach of the\r\n  implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (4) fraud and\r\n  misrepresentation; and (5) violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade\r\n  Practices Act.\r\nMorin\r\n  filed a Motion for Summary Judgment arguing, among other things, the\r\n  Agreement's covenant not to compete provision, the inventions assignment provision,\r\n  and the confidentiality provision were unenforceable.Â  The motion was denied.Â  Shortly\r\n  before trial, Milliken voluntarily dismissed four of its causes of action with\r\n  prejudice, including its two causes of action against Innegrity for conversion\r\n  and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  Morin filed a\r\n  Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, asserting Milliken's claim for the\r\n  assignment of several patents currently held by Innegrity fails as a matter of\r\n  law because Innegrity was dismissed from the case.[4]Â \r\n  After Milliken rested its case, Morin moved for a directed verdict on all\r\n  causes of action and the relief sought by Milliken relating to the patents and\r\n  patent applications owned by Innegrity.Â  The court denied the motion.\r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the trial, only four causes of action against Morin were\r\n  submitted to the jury: (1) breach of the inventions assignment provision of the\r\n  Agreement;[5] (2) breach of the confidentiality provision of the Agreement;[6] (3) violation of the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act; and (4) breach of the\r\n  duty of loyalty.Â  The jury found Morin liable for breach of the Agreement,\r\n  under its inventions assignment and confidentiality provisions, and awarded\r\n  Milliken $25,324 in actual damages.[7]Â \r\n  The verdict form submitted to the jury contained a single blank for the jury to\r\n  award actual damages should it find Morin breached the Agreement.Â  Neither\r\n  party objected to the form or requested a more detailed form.Â  The verdict form\r\n  did not specify which action by Morin constituted a breach of the Agreement, or\r\n  what particular invention or confidential information was involved in Morin's\r\n  breach of the Agreement.Â  \r\nMilliken\r\n  filed a Motion for Equitable Relief and to Alter or Amend Judgment, and Morin\r\n  filed a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the Alternative,\r\n  for a New Trial.Â  After a hearing on the motions, the court denied the motions\r\n  of both parties.Â  Milliken appeals and Morin cross-appeals.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for breach of contract based on an employment agreement\r\n  is an action at law.Â  King v.

S.C. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Comm'n, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989).Â  &quot;An 'adequate'\r\n  remedy at law is one which is as certain, practical, complete and efficient to\r\n  attain the ends of justice and its administration as the remedy in equity.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The party seeking an injunction must prove it has no adequate\r\n  remedy at law.Â  Strategic Res. Co. v. BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540, 544,\r\n  627 S.E.2d 687, 689 (2006).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn its Amended Complaint, Milliken requested actual damages and\r\n  permanent injunctive relief on its claims for breach of contract.Â  At trial,\r\n  Milliken presented evidence of past and future money damages it allegedly\r\n  suffered as a result of Morin's breach of the Agreement, specifically $1,403.26\r\n  in travel expenses for the conference Morin attended in California; $81,080.00\r\n  in benefits and salary compensation; $3,862.85 in paid unused vacation days;\r\n  and an estimated $60 to $65 million in future lost profits from the fiberglass\r\n  market.Â  \r\nThe verdict form submitted to the jury contained a single blank to award actual damages\r\n  should the jury find Morin breached the Agreement under either the inventions assignment\r\n  provision or the confidentiality provision.Â  Milliken did not object to the form; however, Milliken asked the judge to charge the jury on nominal\r\n  damages and suggested $100.00 as a symbolic nominal amount.Â  In his charge to\r\n  the jury on actual and nominal damages, the judge did not charge the jury with\r\n  a specific amount for nominal damages, but stated &quot;they have been referred\r\n  to as a trivial or trifling sum.&quot;Â  Neither party objected to the charge.Â \r\n  The verdict form did not specify whether the damages were for Morin's breach of\r\n  the inventions assignment provision, the confidentiality provision, or both.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury awarded Milliken $25,324.00 in actual damages, which is far from the\r\n  $100.00 amount Milliken requested as an example of nominal damages.Â  Also, the\r\n  amount of damages awarded by the jury appears to be a specific amount that was\r\n  calculated by the jury in some manner, as opposed to a general amount such as\r\n  $25,000.00.Â  Thus, we find Milliken had an adequate remedy at law, and the\r\n  trial judge correctly found Milliken was not entitled to equitable relief.[8]Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Morin's Appeal\r\nIn his cross appeal, Morin argues the circuit court erred by finding the inventions assignment and confidentiality\r\n  provisions of Milliken's Agreement were enforceable.[9]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal of the denial of a motion for a directed verdict or JNOV, this Court applies\r\n  the same standard as the trial court and views the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.

Dudley, 278 S.C. 674, 675, 301 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1983).Â \r\n  The enforceability of a covenant not to compete depends on whether it is: (1) necessary\r\n  for the protection of the legitimate interest of the employer; (2) reasonably\r\n  limited in its operation with respect to time and place; (3) not unduly harsh\r\n  and oppressive in curtailing the legitimate efforts of the employee to earn a\r\n  livelihood; (4) reasonable from the standpoint of sound public policy; and (5) supported\r\n  by valuable consideration.Â  Id. at 675-76, 301 S.E.2d at 143; Carolina\r\n    Chem. Equip. Co. v. Muckenfuss, 322 S.C. 289, 293, 471 S.E.2d 721, 723 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Muckenfuss,\r\n  this court determined a covenant not to divulge trade secrets had the effect of\r\n  a covenant not to compete, and thus, was subject to the same strict scrutiny.Â  Id. at 294, 471 S.E.2d at 723.Â  In making its decision, the court found the section\r\n  substantially restricted Muckenfuss's competitive employment activities by\r\n  preventing him from using the general skills and knowledge he acquired at\r\n  Carolina Chemical; was unlimited in time and territory; was far greater than\r\n  necessary to protect any legitimate business interest; and was unreasonable\r\n  from the standpoint of public policy because of its effects on both the\r\n  employee and the competitive business environment.Â  Id. at 294-95, 471\r\n  S.E.2d at 723-24.Â  The court also noted the provision defined trade secrets\r\n  &quot;so broadly that virtually all of the information Muckenfuss acquired\r\n  during his employment would fall within its definition.&quot; Â Id. at\r\n  296, 471 S.E.2d at 725.Â  \r\nAlso,\r\n  in Nucor Corporation v. Bell, 482 F.Supp. 2d 714, 729-30 (D.S.C. 2007),\r\n  the South Carolina District Court found a non-disclosure agreement was subject\r\n  to the same requirements as a non-compete covenant.Â  Using this standard, the\r\n  court determined the agreement was unenforceable because it defined &quot;'confidential\r\n  information' so broadly that virtually all of the information Bell acquired\r\n  during his employment would fall within its definition&quot; and &quot;forbid[]\r\n  Bell from engaging in any employment similar to his employment with\r\n  Nucor.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nMorin\r\n  asserts that both the inventions\r\n  assignment and confidentiality provisions should be scrutinized under the\r\n  standards of a covenant not to compete because both provisions were overly\r\n  broad; harsh and oppressive in curtailing his legitimate efforts to earn a\r\n  livelihood; inappropriate as they prevent him from using the general skills and\r\n  knowledge he acquired at Milliken; and unreasonable from the standpoint of\r\n  sound public policy.Â  However, the inventions assignment provision limited the\r\n  inventions to those made, authored, and conceived by Morin, either solely or\r\n  jointly with others, during his employment, whether or not during normal\r\n  working hours or whether or not at Milliken's premises, or within one year after\r\n  termination of his employment with Milliken.Â  It did not apply to inventions for\r\n  which no equipment, supplies, facility, or proprietary information of Milliken were\r\n  used; that were developed entirely on an employee's own time; that did not\r\n  relate directly to the current or anticipated business of Milliken; or that were\r\n  not the result of any work performed for Milliken.Â  Thus, the inventions\r\n  assignment provision was narrowly drafted to restrict the category of\r\n  inventions that were assigned to Milliken to those related to Milliken's\r\n  business or research, or that were created using Milliken's resources.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the inventions assignment provision was limited to one year and to\r\n  subject matter that Morin worked on or had knowledge of during his employment\r\n  with Milliken.\r\nMilliken's\r\n  confidentiality provision limits the information to all competitively sensitive\r\n  information of importance to and kept by Milliken for three years.[10]Â \r\n  The three-year provision did not prohibit Morin from disclosing or using any\r\n  and all information he learned working at Milliken, or using the general\r\n  knowledge and skills he learned while working there.Â  Furthermore, Morin\r\n  testified he could have obtained other jobs without violating the\r\n  confidentiality provision.Â  Thus, the confidentiality provision did not\r\n  substantially restrict Morin's competitive employment activities.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Morin argues the provisions were unenforceable because they were unlimited in\r\n  territory.Â  In Dudley, our supreme court found a &quot;geographic\r\n  restriction is generally reasonable if the area covered by the restraint is\r\n  limited to the territory in which the employee was able, during the term of his\r\n  employment, to establish contact with his employer's customers.&quot;Â  Dudley,\r\n  278 S.C. at 676, 301 S.E.2d at 143.Â  Furthermore, &quot;[w]hile 'the general\r\n  test is that contractual prohibitions must be geographically limited to what is\r\n  reasonably necessary to protect the employer's business . . . [p]rohibitions\r\n  against contacting existing customers can be a valid substitute for a\r\n  geographic limitation.'&quot;Â  Rockford Mfg., Ltd. v. Bennet, 296\r\n  F.Supp. 2d 681, 689 (D.S.C. 2003) (quoting Wolf v. Colonial Life and Accident\r\n    Ins. Co., 309 S.C. 100, 109, 420 S.E.2d 217, 222 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  Here,\r\n  the provisions were limited to competitors of Milliken, which is reasonably\r\n  necessary to protect Milliken's business.Â  Therefore, we find the trial judge\r\n  correctly found the confidentiality and inventions assignment provisions of\r\n  Milliken's Associate Agreement were enforceable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we affirm the circuit court's denial of Milliken's request for equitable relief\r\n  and the circuit court's finding that the inventions assignment and confidentiality\r\n  provisions of Milliken's Associate Agreement are enforceable.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Morin testified he is the president of Innegrity and\r\n  owns thirty percent of the company.Â  He also testified there are thirty-eight other\r\n  investors.\r\n[2]Â  InnoVenture is a convention where entrepreneurial\r\n  companies can make presentations to prospective investors.Â  \r\n[3] Â Morin also testified he told Milliken his company\r\n  would not interfere with Milliken's business, and he planned for Innegrity to\r\n  be a customer of and supplier to Milliken.Â  \r\n[4]Â  The court did not rule on Morin's motion at that\r\n  time, stating: &quot;I think we can take care of that matter after we take care\r\n  of the jury.Â  That would be something that I can hear you on at the end of the\r\n  verdict.Â  It might not even be an issue, who knows.Â  But if it is, then we will\r\n  address that later.&quot;\r\n[5] Â Milliken's &quot;Inventions Assignment&quot; provision\r\n  is found in section A of the Agreement and is as follows:\r\n\r\n\tWith\r\n  respect to Inventions made, authored and conceived by me, either solely or\r\n  jointly with others, (1) during my employment, whether or not during normal\r\n  working hours or whether or not at Milliken's premises; or (2) within one year\r\n  after termination of my employment; I will:\r\n\ta.&nbsp; Keep\r\n  accurate, complete and timely records of such Inventions, which records shall\r\n  be Milliken property and be retained on Milliken's premises.\r\n\tb.&nbsp; Promptly\r\n  and fully disclose and describe such Inventions in writing to Milliken.\r\n\tc.&nbsp; Assign\r\n  (and I do hereby assign) to Milliken all of my rights to such Inventions, and\r\n  to applications for letters patent, copyright registrations and/or mask work\r\n  regulations in all countries and to letters patent, copyright registrations\r\n  and/or mask work registrations granted upon such Inventions in all countries.\r\n\td.&nbsp; Acknowledge\r\n  and deliver promptly to Milliken (without charge to Milliken but at the expense\r\n  of Milliken) such written instruments and to do such other acts as may be\r\n  necessary in the opinion of Milliken to preserve property rights against\r\n  forfeiture, abandonment or loss and to obtain, defend and maintain letters patent,\r\n  copyright registrations and/or mask work registrations and to vest the entire right\r\n  and title thereto in Milliken.\r\n\tNOTICE:Â \r\n  This is to notify you that paragraph A of this Milliken &quot;Associate\r\n  Agreement&quot; you are being asked to sign as a condition of your employment\r\n  does not apply to an Invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or\r\n  proprietary information of Milliken was used and which was developed entirely\r\n  on your own time, and (1) which does not relate (a) directly to the business of\r\n  Milliken or (b) to Milliken's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or\r\n  development, or (2) which does not result from any work performed by you for\r\n  Milliken.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 4, the\r\n  Agreement defines &quot;Inventions&quot; as:\r\n\r\n\t&quot;discoveries,\r\n  improvements and ideas (whether or not shown or described in writing or reduced\r\n  to practice), mask works (topography or semiconductor chips) and works of\r\n  authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or registerable, (1) which\r\n  relate directly to the business of Milliken, or (2) which relate to Milliken's\r\n  actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (3) which result\r\n  from any work performed by me for Milliken, or (4) for which any equipment,\r\n  supplies, facility or Trade Secret or Confidential Information of Milliken is\r\n  used, or (5) which is developed on any Milliken time.&quot;\r\n\r\n[6] Milliken's &quot;Confidentiality&quot; provision is\r\n  found in section B of the Agreement and is as follows:\r\n\r\n\t&quot;I\r\n  also agree not to use, disclose, modify or adapt any Confidential Information\r\n  as defined in paragraph 3 hereinabove until three (3) years after the\r\n  termination of my employment except as authorized in the performance of my\r\n  duties for Milliken.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 3, the\r\n  Agreement defines &quot;Confidential Information&quot; as:\r\n\r\n\t&quot;all\r\n  competitively sensitive information of importance to and kept in confidence by\r\n  Milliken, which becomes known to me through my employment with Milliken and\r\n  which does not fall within the definition of Trade Secret above.&quot;\r\n\r\n[7]Â  The jury also found for Milliken on Morin's\r\n  counterclaims.Â  \r\n[8]Â  We do not reach the merits of Milliken's remaining\r\n  issues because this issue is dispositive of the case.Â  Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (stating that if an appellate court's ruling on a particular issue is\r\n  dispositive of an appeal, rulings on remaining issues are unnecessary).Â  \r\n[9]Â  Morin also argues that if one provision is found to\r\n  be unenforceable, the whole Agreement is unenforceable; however, we need not\r\n  address this issue because we find both provisions to be enforceable.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Morin raises this argument for the first time on appeal; thus, the\r\n  issue is not preserved.Â  Pye\r\n    v.

Â Fairchild requested a\r\n  jury trial and sought both actual and punitive damages.Â  Ultimately, Fairchild\r\n  entered into a covenant not to sue with SCDOT, and the Honorable Roger Young\r\n  dismissed SCDOT as a party to the action.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, both sides\r\n  presented evidence regarding what happened on the day of the accident, as well\r\n  as medical evidence regarding Fairchild's injuries.Â  Over the course of the\r\n  trial, both sides also made several motions.Â  Palmer moved for an independent\r\n  medical exam pursuant to Rule 35(a), SCRE, and sought to have it performed by\r\n  Dr. James Ballenger, a psychiatrist with whom Palmer had consulted as an expert\r\n  witness.Â  Ultimately, the trial court denied Palmer's request because Dr.\r\n  Ballenger was listed as an expert witness for the defense.Â  At the close of the\r\n  evidence, the trial court directed a verdict for Fairchild on Palmer's affirmative\r\n  defense of comparative negligence. Â Thereafter, Palmer renewed his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict as to punitive damages, and the trial court granted the motion.Â \r\n  The trial court also refused to charge the jury with several instructions requested\r\n  by Fairchild.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of trial, the\r\n  jury found in favor of Fairchild and awarded her $720,000 in damages.[2]Â \r\n  After the jury published its verdict, Fairchild moved for a judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, for a new trial nisi additur.Â  The trial court denied all of Fairchild's post-trial motions.Â \r\n  Both Palmer and Fairchild appeal. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Jury Instructions\r\nFairchild contends the trial\r\n  court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on three requested charges.Â  She maintains\r\n  the charges were timely submitted to the trial court, and the charges would\r\n  have assisted the jury in making an informed decision based on South Carolina\r\n  law; thus, the charges rendered were inadequate.Â  Palmer argues there were no\r\n  allegations or evidence of the intervening negligence of third persons in this\r\n  case.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury\r\n  on the charges.Â  Finally, Palmer submits Fairchild cannot demonstrate the\r\n  requisite error or prejudice to warrant reversal on this basis.Â  We agree with\r\n  Fairchild and find the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on\r\n  the requested charges.Â  \r\n&quot;An appellate court will\r\n  not reverse the trial court's decision regarding jury instructions unless the\r\n  trial court committed an abuse of discretion.&quot; Â Cole v. Raut, 378\r\n  S.C. 398, 404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or is not supported\r\n  by the evidence.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;A\r\n  trial court must charge the current and correct law.&quot;Â  Wells v. Halyard,\r\n  341 S.C. 234, 237, 533 S.E.2d 341, 343 (Ct. App. 2000). Â In reviewing a jury\r\n  charge for alleged error, an appellate court must consider the charge as a\r\n  whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;Ordinarily, a trial [court] has a duty to give a requested instruction\r\n  that correctly states the law applicable to the issues and evidence.&quot; Â Fernanders\r\n    v. Marks Constr. of S.C., Inc.,Â  330 S.C. 470, 473, 499 S.E.2d 509, 510 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998).Â  However, jury instructions should be confined to the issues made\r\n  by the pleadings and supported by the evidence. Â Baker v. Weaver, 279\r\n  S.C. 479, 482, 309 S.E.2d 770, 771 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  In Burns v. South\r\n    Carolina Commission for Blind, 323 S.C. 77, 80, 448 S.E.2d 589, 591 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (internal citations omitted) this court held:\r\nIf the\r\n  requested charge states a sound principle of law that is applicable to the\r\n  case, and not otherwise covered by the charge, refusal to charge it is error\r\n  and requires a new trial. Â Moreover, when general instructions to the jury are\r\n  insufficient to enable the jury to understand fully the law of the case and\r\n  issues involved, a refusal to give a requested charge is reversible error.\r\nTo warrant reversal, the\r\n  party seeking the requested jury charge must demonstrate error and prejudice.Â  Cole\r\n    v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 405, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008) (&quot;An erroneous\r\n  jury instruction, however, is not grounds for reversal unless the appellant can\r\n  show prejudice from the erroneous instruction.&quot;). Â &quot;An alleged error\r\n  is harmless if the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\n  the alleged error did not contribute to the verdict.&quot;Â  Wells, 341\r\n  S.C. at 237, 533 S.E.2d at 343. \r\nIn the present case,\r\n  Fairchild requested the trial court submit the following charges to the jury:[3]\r\nPlaintiff's\r\n  Request to Charge Number 11:Â  Liability exists for the natural and probable\r\n  consequences of negligent acts and omissions, proximately flowing there from.Â \r\n  Intervening negligence of a third person will not excuse the original wrongdoer\r\n  if such intervention ought to have been foreseen in the exercise of due care.Â  Matthews\r\n    v. Porter, 239 S.C. 620, 124 S.E.2d 321 (1962).Â  It is the law in South\r\n  Carolina that the negligence of a treating doctor is reasonably foreseeable. Â It\r\n  is the general rule that if an injured person uses ordinary care in selecting a\r\n  physician for treatment of his injury, the law regards the aggravation of the\r\n  injury resulting from the negligent act of the doctor as part of the immediate\r\n  and direct damages which naturally flow from the original injury.Â  Bessinger\r\n    v. Deloach, 230 S.C. 1, 94 S.E.2d 3 (1956); Graham v. Whitaker, 282\r\n  S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984).\r\nPlaintiff's\r\n  Request to Charge Number 12:Â  The intervening negligence of a third person will\r\n  not excuse the original wrongdoer if such intervention ought to have been\r\n  foreseen in the exercise of due care.Â  Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393,\r\n  321 S.E.2d 40 (S.C. 1984).Â  The negligence of an attending physician is reasonably\r\n  foreseeable.Â  Therefore, if an injured person uses ordinary care in selecting a\r\n  physician for treatment of her injuries, the law regards the aggravation of the\r\n  injury resulting from the negligent act of the physician as part of the\r\n  immediate and direct damages which naturally flow from the original injury.Â  Payton\r\n    v. Kearse, 319 S.C. 188, 460 S.E.2d 220 (Ct.App. 1995).\r\nPlaintiff's\r\n  Request to Charge Number 13:Â  I CHARGE YOU THAT &quot;if an injured person uses\r\n  ordinary care in selecting a physician for treatment of his injury, the law\r\n  regards the aggravation of the injury resulting from the negligent act of [or treatment\r\n  by] the physician as a part of the immediate and direct damages which naturally\r\n  flow from the original injury.&quot;Â  Bessinger v. DeLoach, 94 S.E.2d 3,\r\n  5, (S.C. 1956).\r\nIn its ruling regarding the\r\n  jury charge, the trial court stated it refused to charge the jury on the\r\n  requests because there was no evidence of negligence by an attending\r\n  physician.Â  However, Fairchild made a\r\n  compelling argument that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the\r\n  requested charges.Â  Fairchild argues defense counsel stressed the side effects\r\n  of the drugs Fairchild took and suggested she was overmedicated.Â  Palmer seems\r\n  to imply the overmedication, rather than Palmer's negligence, was the source of\r\n  many of Fairchild's ailments.Â  In support of his theory, Palmer called and\r\n  questioned several doctors and nurses to discuss Fairchild's course of\r\n  treatment.Â  The following statement by opposing counsel made during closing\r\n  arguments, in particular, was convincing that the charges were relevant:Â \r\n  &quot;So ask yourself, is it the chronic post-traumatic headache that is the\r\n  disabling headache, or is it the medication over-use that is the disabling\r\n  headache?&quot;Â  Therefore, we find Fairchild demonstrated error.Â  Moreover,\r\n  given the jury's verdict and the amount of damages at issue, we also find the\r\n  trial court's refusal to instruct the jury could have impacted the jury's\r\n  verdict, thereby proving prejudice.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred\r\n  in failing to instruct the jury on Fairchild's requested charges.[4]Â \r\n  Therefore, we reverse and remand.Â  \r\nII.Â  Punitive Damages\r\nFairchild maintains the trial\r\n  court erred in directing a verdict in favor of Palmer on Fairchild's punitive\r\n  damages claim because evidence presented a jury question as to whether Palmer\r\n  was reckless.Â  In support of her recklessness claim, Fairchild notes Palmer was\r\n  driving a large commercial truck in heavy traffic when the accident occurred,\r\n  but still maintained a speed of sixty-five to seventy miles per hour.Â  Based on\r\n  Palmer's conduct and his statutory violations, Fairchild maintains the jury\r\n  should have been permitted to consider whether Palmer acted recklessly.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Current South Carolina\r\n  Precedent\r\nWhen evidence presented at\r\n  trial yields only one conclusion concerning liability, the trial court may\r\n  properly grant a motion for directed verdict.Â  See Ecclesiastes Prod.\r\n    Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., 374 S.C. 483, 490, 649 S.E.2d 494, 497\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (â€œA motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and may\r\n  be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability.â€).Â \r\n  So long as no more than one inference is created from the evidence presented, a\r\n  jury issue is not created, and the trial court is proper in directing a\r\n  verdict.Â  Huffines Co. v. Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 187, 617 S.E.2d 125,\r\n  129 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding when the evidence is susceptible of more than one\r\n  reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the court may not grant a\r\n  directed verdict).Â  \r\n&quot;A plaintiff is entitled\r\n  to recover punitive damages if the act complained of is determined to be\r\n  willful, wanton or reckless.&quot;Â  Camp v. Components, Inc., 285 S.C.\r\n  443, 444, 330 S.E.2d 315, 316 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  A jury may award punitive\r\n  damages even &quot;when the wrongdoer does not actually realize that he is\r\n  invading the rights of another, provided the act is committed in such a manner\r\n  that a person of ordinary prudence would say that it was a reckless disregard\r\n  of another's rights.&quot; Â Id. (quoting Hicks v. McCandlish, 221\r\n  S.C. 410, 415-16, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1952)).Â  \r\nUnder current South Carolina\r\n  precedent, negligence per se is evidence of recklessness requiring the trial\r\n  court to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury.Â  Wise v. Broadway,\r\n  315 S.C. 273, 276, 433 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1993) (&quot;The causative violation of\r\n  a statute constitutes negligence per se and is evidence of recklessness and\r\n  willfulness, requiring the submission of the issue of punitive damages to the\r\n  jury.&quot;); Rhodes v. Lawrence, 279 S.C. 96, 97-98, 302 S.E.2d 343,\r\n  344 (1983) (&quot;In these circumstances, a jury question as to punitive\r\n  damages was clearly presented given the well settled rule that a showing of\r\n  statutory violation can be evidence of recklessness and willfulness.&quot;); Austin\r\n    v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 314, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004) (&quot;A factual question as to punitive damages is presented when\r\n  there is evidence of a statutory violation.&quot;).Â  These cases limit their\r\n  holdings to creating a jury question only and not recklessness per se.Â  In that\r\n  regard the Wise court held:Â  \r\nViolation\r\n  of a statute does not constitute recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness per se, but is some evidence that the defendant acted recklessly, willfully,\r\n  and wantonly. Â It is always for the jury to determine whether a party has been\r\n  reckless, willful, and wanton. Â However, it is not obligatory as a matter of\r\n  law for the jury to make such a finding in every case of a statutory violation.\r\n315 S.C. at 276-77, 433\r\n  S.E.2d at 859 (internal citations omitted).Â  In Austin, this court\r\n  upheld the Wise holding finding a jury question is created when evidence\r\n  supports violation of a statute rather than recklessness per se.Â  358 S.C. at\r\n  314-15, 594 S.E.2d at 875-76.Â  \r\nWise is factually similar to the present case.Â  There, Broadway\r\n  was following Wise at a distance of three to four car lengths and was driving a\r\n  heavy duty pickup truck with a half-full 140-gallon fuel tank in the back.Â  Wise,\r\n  315 S.C. at 275, 433 S.E.2d at 858.Â  When Wise braked in preparation for a\r\n  turn, Broadway, unable to bring his vehicle to a stop, hit Wise from behind.Â  Id. at 275, 433 S.E.2d at 859.Â  The trial court struck Wise's punitive damages\r\n  request after stating it did not believe a simple statutory violation gave rise\r\n  to a punitive damages charge.Â  Id. at 276, 433 S.E.2d at 859.Â  The\r\n  supreme court found the trial court erred and remanded the case for a new\r\n  trial.Â  Id. at 277, 433 S.E.2d at 859. \r\nThis court ruled similarly in Austin, and affirmed a trial court's submission of a punitive damages\r\n  claim to the jury.Â  358 S.C. at 320, 594 S.E.2d at 878.Â  There, while merging\r\n  onto U.S. 29, a tractor-trailer failed to yield to Austin's right of way.Â  Id. at 304, 594 S.E.2d at 870.Â  The truck struck Austin's vehicle, causing\r\n  injuries.Â  Id.Â  This court found Specialty Transportation's agent\r\n  violated certain statutes by failing to stop and yield to Austin's right of way\r\n  which established negligence per se.Â  Id. at 314, 594 S.E.2d at 875.Â \r\n  Therefore, submission of punitive damages to the jury was affirmed.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Cases Preceding Wise\r\nAs Palmer noted at oral\r\n  argument and in his briefs, Wise did not specifically overrule Bell\r\n    v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, 202 S.C. 160, 24 S.E.2d 177 (1943), and Cubbage\r\n      v. Roos, 181 S.C. 188, 186 S.E. 794 (1936). Further, as then Associate\r\n  Justice Toal noted in her dissenting opinion in Wise:Â  &quot;Where only\r\n  one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence, however, the\r\n  question becomes one of law for the court, and the court can refuse to submit\r\n  punitive damages to the jury, even though the letter of some statute has not\r\n  been observed by the defendant.&quot; Â 315 S.C. at 281, 433 S.E.2d at 861-62 (Toal\r\n  A.J., dissenting) (citing Bell, 202 S.C. 160, 24 S.E.2d 177 (1943)).Â  Â \r\nIn Bell, the jury\r\n  awarded both actual and punitive damages after Bell alleged Atlantic Coast failed\r\n  to maintain a railroad crossing in a manner safe for public use as required by\r\n  law.Â  202 S.C. at 163-65, 24 S.E.2d at 179.Â  There, the trial court refused to\r\n  direct a verdict on punitive damages and later refused to set aside the punitive\r\n  damages award.Â  Id. at 164-65, 24 S.E.2d at 179.Â  On review, the Bell court found no testimony supported the allegations in Bell's complaint.Â  Id. at 171, 24 S.E.2d at 182.Â  In referencing Cubbage, the court stated:Â \r\n  &quot;[W]e do not think that the existence of these statutes is controlling of\r\n  the question of punitive damages under the testimony herein, if indeed, such\r\n  statutes had any bearing on any phase of the case.&quot;Â  202 S.C. at 173, 24\r\n  S.E.2d at 183.Â  Additionally, the Bell court found:Â  &quot;It is not\r\n  enough for a plaintiff to show that the defendant neglected a duty imposed by\r\n  statute and that he would not have been injured if the duty had been\r\n  performed.&quot;Â  Id. at 174, 24 S.E.2d at 183 (citation omitted).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the court found &quot;the trial [court] erred in refusing to direct a verdict against\r\n  punitive damages, and in submitting the question of punitive damages to the\r\n  jury, and . . . in overruling the defendant's motion for a new trial with\r\n  respect to punitive damages.&quot; Â 202 S.C. at 175, 24 S.E.2d at 184.Â  Though\r\n  dicta rather than a holding, we find language from Bell in conflict with\r\n  later cases.Â  \r\nIn Cubbage, the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant a new trial\r\n  after the jury rendered a verdict on both actual and punitive damages.Â  181\r\n  S.C. at 203, 186 S.E. at 795.Â  There, the trial court believed it erred in\r\n  submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury even though evidence\r\n  demonstrated Roos was driving over the posted speed limit when he hit a child\r\n  crossing the street.Â  Id. at 190, 186 S.E. at 795.Â  After reviewing\r\n  several cases, the Cubbage court found:Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court has not held that the mere violation of the letter of a statute in and of\r\n  itself requires the [trial court] to submit an issue of recklessness,\r\n  willfulness, or wantonness where the evidence shows that the spirit of the\r\n  statute was being complied with, and the only reasonable inference from all the\r\n  testimony is that such violation of the statute did not in fact amount to a\r\n  reckless, willful, or wanton act. . . . In no case called to our attention has\r\n  the court held that the trial [court] is powerless to direct a verdict as to\r\n  punitive damages, or more properly speaking, peremptorily instruct the jury\r\n  that it cannot award punitive damages, even though the letter of some statute\r\n  has not been observed. To so hold would overrule the well-recognized principle\r\n  that if only one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence, it\r\n  becomes a question of law for the court, and not a question of fact for the\r\n  jury. Â Â \r\nId. at 195-96, 186 S.E. at 797.Â  When read in conjunction\r\n  with preceding cases like Bell and Cubbage, which are still in\r\n  effect, the law is unclear.Â  Although in conflict with Bell and Cubbage,\r\n  principles from Wise, Rhodes, and Austin are controlling\r\n  as the latest precedent, and until the South Carolina Supreme Court clarifies\r\n  this issue, trial courts are bound to charge the jury on punitive damages when presented\r\n  evidence of negligence per se.Â  \r\nIn the present case, because\r\n  evidence existed Palmer was negligent per se, we reverse the grant of Palmer's\r\n  directed verdict motion on punitive damages.Â  Specifically, evidence existed\r\n  Palmer was following another vehicle too closely and speeding.Â  Consequently,\r\n  the jury could have found he violated sections 56-5-1930(a) and 56-5-1520(A) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2006).Â  Therefore, because we are bound by supreme\r\n  court precedent, we find the trial court erred by granting Palmer's directed\r\n  verdict motion because a finding of a statutory violation may be considered by\r\n  the jury as evidence of recklessness.Â  Accordingly, we remand and instruct the\r\n  trial court to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury.Â  On remand, whether\r\n  or not punitive damages are warranted will be left to the jury's determination.\r\nIII.Â  Motion for New Trial\r\nAdditionally, Fairchild argues\r\n  the trial court erred in denying her motion for a new trial because the verdict\r\n  was grossly inadequate based on the evidence.Â  Specifically, Fairchild maintains\r\n  the trial court should have vetoed the jury's verdict using the thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine. Â Alternatively, Fairchild maintains the trial court could have\r\n  granted a new trial absolute on the inadequate verdict.Â  Given our ruling on the\r\n  jury instruction issue, we need not address this issue.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\n  its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Independent\r\n  Medical Examination\r\nNext,\r\n  Palmer argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for an Independent\r\n  Medical Examination (IME) of Fairchild. Â Specifically, Palmer contends\r\n  Fairchild did not pose a reasonable objection to his selection of Dr. Ballenger\r\n  to perform the IME.[5]Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, appellate\r\n  courts will be bound by the findings of the trial court on motions preliminary\r\n  to trial when the evidence conflicts or the findings are supported by evidence\r\n  and not clearly wrong or controlled by an error of law.Â  City of Chester v.\r\n    Addison, 277 S.C. 179, 182, 284 S.E.2d 579, 580 (1981); Askins v.\r\n      Firedoor Corp., 281 S.C. 611, 615, 316 S.E.2d 713, 715 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nPalmer moved for an IME\r\n  pursuant to Rule 35(a), SCRCP, and sought to have it performed by Dr. James\r\n  Ballenger, a psychiatrist with whom Palmer consulted as an expert witness.Â  At\r\n  the motion hearing, Fairchild objected to Dr. Ballenger's relationship with Dr.\r\n  Price, another expert in the case. Â Fairchild also argued Dr. Ballenger\r\n  should not perform an IME because he had reviewed Fairchild's medical records\r\n  to form an opinion and would be biased. Â Judge Young ruled that\r\n  Fairchild had raised a reasonable objection and informed the parties he would\r\n  appoint another physician to perform the examination. Â After Palmer moved for\r\n  reconsideration, Judge Young withdrew his order and recused himself from the\r\n  case.Â  \r\nSubsequently, a second\r\n  hearing was held off the record in Judge Buckner's chambers.Â  Judge\r\n  Buckner issued an order stating Palmer met the requirements of Rule 35(a), but\r\n  Dr. Ballenger could not perform the exam because he was an expert witness for\r\n  Palmer and had reviewed Fairchild's medical records.Â  The order further stated\r\n  there was no finding of bias on the part of Dr. Ballenger, but another physician\r\n  who had not reviewed the records and had not been retained as an expert witness\r\n  should perform the examination. Â The order gave Palmer the opportunity to\r\n  submit alternate psychiatrists to perform the exam, but Palmer was unwilling to\r\n  pay for another physician. Â Therefore, the trial court denied Palmer's\r\n  motion to have Dr. Ballenger perform an IME of Fairchild. Â At trial, the\r\n  court again stated that the motion for Dr. Ballenger to perform the IME was\r\n  denied not because of Dr. Ballenger's qualifications or whether he was biased,\r\n  but because he was listed as an expert witness in Palmer's discovery responses.Â  The trial court further stated that &quot;independent means independent and\r\n  that means no witness has previously been identified by the Plaintiff or the\r\n  Defendant gives the independent medical exam.&quot; Â \r\nPalmer argues Fairchild\r\n  failed to raise a reasonable objection to his motion requesting Dr. Ballenger\r\n  perform the IME. According to Rule 35(a) (emphasis added):\r\nIn any\r\n  case in which the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000 actual damages, and\r\n  the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party, or of\r\n  a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in\r\n  controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to\r\n  submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician or to produce for\r\n  examination the person in his custody or legal control. The order may be made\r\n  only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be\r\n  examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner,\r\n  conditions and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is\r\n  to be made, and shall be delivered to the person or persons making the\r\n  examination.\r\nThe\r\n  physician of the party to be examined may be present at the examination. Unless\r\n  the parties agree, or the court for good cause shown determines otherwise, the\r\n  examination shall be in the county where the person to be examined, or his\r\n  physician, resides. Special consideration shall be given to the convenience of\r\n  the person to be examined and that of his physician in setting the time and\r\n  place of the examination, and reasonable consideration shall be given to the\r\n  convenience of the examining physician. Upon reasonable objection to the\r\n    physician designated to make the examination, and if the parties shall fail to\r\n    agree as to who shall make the examination, the court may designate a\r\n    physician; but the fact that a physician was so designated shall not be admissible\r\n    upon the trial.[6]\r\nPer Rule 35, the court may\r\n  designate a physician to perform a mental or physical examination upon a\r\n  reasonable objection to the physician previously selected.Â  Here, we find\r\n  Fairchild had a reasonable basis to object to Dr. Ballenger because he had a\r\n  pre-existing relationship with Palmer.Â  Dr. Ballenger was listed as an expert\r\n  witness for the defense and had reviewed Fairchild's medical records.&nbsp; We\r\n  believe such a role and his previous involvement warrants a reasonable\r\n  objection for the trial court to sustain.&nbsp; See Main v. Tony L.\r\n    Scheston-Luxor Cab Co., 89 N.W.2d 865, 868 (Iowa 1958) (affirming the trial\r\n  court's ruling sustaining the plaintiff's objection to the defendant's choice\r\n  of physician to perform an IME because the physician was a client of defense\r\n  counsel); Adkins v. Eitel, 206 N.E.2d 573, 575 (Ohio Ct. App. 1965)\r\n  (holding the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the plaintiff to\r\n  submit to a medical examination by a physician who was a neighbor and client of\r\n  defense counsel);Â  see also Powell v. U.S., 149 F.R.D. 122, 124\r\n  (E.D.Va. 1993) (citing Adkins, 206 N.E.2d at 575 and Main, 89\r\n  N.W.2d at 868) (noting a social, business, or attorney-client relationship\r\n  between a physician and defense counsel would have been the basis for a valid\r\n  objection to a physician selected to perform a medical examination).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying\r\n  Palmer's motion for an IME by Dr. Ballenger and affirm its decision.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nFinally, Palmer argues the\r\n  trial court erred in directing a verdict for Fairchild on the issue of\r\n  comparative negligence. Â Specifically, Palmer contends Fairchild did not\r\n  take sufficient measures to avoid the accident.&nbsp; Based on Fairchild's\r\n  conduct, Palmer maintains the jury should have been permitted to consider\r\n  whether Fairchild acted negligently. Â Fairchild maintains there is no factual issue\r\n  about her conduct from which a jury could have reasonably concluded she was\r\n  comparatively negligent.[7] Â We agree with Fairchild.\r\nWhen evidence presented at\r\n  trial yields only one conclusion concerning liability, the trial court may\r\n  properly grant a motion for directed verdict.Â  See Ecclesiastes Prod.\r\n    Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., 374 S.C. 483, 490, 649 S.E.2d 494, 497\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (â€œA motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and may\r\n  be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability.â€).Â \r\n  So long as no more than one inference is created from the evidence presented, a\r\n  jury issue is not created, and the trial court is proper in directing a\r\n  verdict.Â  Henson v. Intâ€™l Paper Co., 358 S.C. 133, 147, 594 S.E.2d 499,\r\n  506 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding when the evidence is susceptible of more than one\r\n  reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the court may not grant a\r\n  directed verdict).\r\nPalmer argues Fairchild &quot;flashing&quot;\r\n  her brakes was not a sufficient warning to the traffic behind her. Â He\r\n  contends Fairchild's testimony that she coasted for a quarter of a mile before\r\n  the accident could reasonably be construed to mean that she was decelerating\r\n  without the warning of her brake lights to the traffic behind her. Â Furthermore,\r\n  Palmer argues Fairchild failed to take adequate measures to prepare for the\r\n  oncoming hazard and thus she was forced to make an abrupt stop.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Palmer contends the question of Fairchild's negligence was for the jury to\r\n  decide.Â  \r\nFairchild maintains her\r\n  testimony indicates she never took her foot off the brake as she approached the\r\n  trailer. Â She argues motorists do not have a duty to apply their brakes\r\n  in a certain way to adequately warn other motorists. Â Fairchild contends\r\n  the testimony at trial indicated Palmer saw her slowing down immediately after\r\n  the cars in front of them moved to the right lane and he began applying his\r\n  brakes because he realized she was slowing down.Â  Moreover, Fairchild notes\r\n  Palmer admitted in his testimony she made a safe choice in operating her\r\n  vehicle under the circumstances.Â  \r\n&quot;In order to establish a\r\n  cause of action in negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following three\r\n  elements: (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of that\r\n  duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from\r\n  the breach of duty.&quot; Â Snavely v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 379 S.C.\r\n  386, 394, 665 S.E.2d 222, 226 (Ct. App. 2008). Â A plaintiff may only recover\r\n  damages if his own negligence is not greater than that of the defendant. Id. Â A determination of the degrees of negligence attributable to the plaintiff and\r\n  the defendant presents a question of fact for the jury to decide.Â  Id. at\r\n  394-95, 665 S.E.2d at 226. Â &quot;In a comparative negligence case, the trial\r\n  court should grant a motion for directed verdict if the sole reasonable\r\n  inference from the evidence is that the non-moving party's negligence exceeded\r\n  fifty percent.&quot;Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 429,\r\n  611 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2005).\r\nAs Fairchild notes, under\r\n  South Carolina law, motorists do not have a duty to apply their brakes in a\r\n  certain way to adequately warn other motorists.Â  According to section\r\n  56-5-2150(c) of the South Carolina Code (2006): &quot;No person shall stop or\r\n  suddenly decrease the speed of a vehicle without first giving an appropriate\r\n  signal in the manner provided herein to the driver of any vehicle immediately\r\n  to the rear when there is opportunity to give such signal.&quot;Â  Appropriate\r\n  signals are defined as hand signals and signal lamps.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2180(a) (2006).Â  \r\nFairchild testified at trial\r\n  and in her deposition that she &quot;flashed&quot; her brakes to indicate to\r\n  the motorists behind her she may have to stop.Â  She further testified\r\n  she had her foot on the brake as she continued to coast in order to stay ahead\r\n  of the car behind her and not hit the trailer obstructing the highway. Â While\r\n  Fairchild testified she accelerated after twice applying the brakes in order to\r\n  say ahead of the traffic behind her, the evidence indicates she properly\r\n  signaled she was slowing down and preparing to stop.Â Â  Moreover, Palmer\r\n  testified he saw Fairchild's brake lights after the cars between his and\r\n  Fairchild's moved to the right lane. Â Palmer also testified Fairchild\r\n  made the safe choice when she slowed down, signaled to traffic behind her,\r\n  maintained control of her vehicle, and avoided impact with the trailer. Â Therefore,\r\n  the evidence in the record indicates Fairchild did not breach her duty to\r\n  signal to the motorists traveling behind her when she was slowing down and\r\n  preparing to stop.Â  \r\nPalmer also argues Fairchild\r\n  saw the trailer obstructing the road and did not take sufficient measures to\r\n  avoid it until the last possible moment. Â Palmer contends it was improper for\r\n  Fairchild to coast for a quarter of a mile down the highway and that a\r\n  reasonable jury could have concluded Fairchild saw the hazard ahead and did not\r\n  react properly.Â  Evidence in the record indicates Fairchild saw the trailer in\r\n  the roadway and slowed down to avoid impact.Â  Palmer presented no evidence\r\n  indicating Fairchild should have reacted differently when she saw the trailer\r\n  blocking her lane of the highway.Â  Moreover, motorists in South Carolina are\r\n  not under any duty to apply their brakes in a certain way when slowing down.Â \r\n  Thus, because Palmer failed to offer evidence Fairchild violated traffic laws,\r\n  was speeding or following too closely, or any other evidence to support an\r\n  inference of negligence, we affirm the trial court's grant of a directed\r\n  verdict on the issue of comparative negligence.Â  See Hurd, 363\r\n  S.C. at 429, 611 S.E.2d at 492 (&quot;In a comparative negligence case, the\r\n  trial court should grant a motion for directed verdict if the sole reasonable\r\n  inference from the evidence is that the non-moving party's negligence exceeded\r\n  fifty percent.&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the trial court's decision not to instruct\r\n  the jury on the substance of Fairchild's requested charges and reverse and\r\n  remand this case for a new trial.Â  Further, we also find the trial court erred\r\n  in directing a verdict in favor of Palmer on punitive damages.Â  Accordingly, on\r\n  remand, the trial court should submit punitive damages to the jury.Â  Because\r\n  reversing the trial court on its failure to instruct the jury on certain\r\n  charges will result in a new trial, we do not need to address whether the trial\r\n  court erred in refusing to grant a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi additur.Â  We affirm the trial court's decision regarding the IME and\r\n  affirm the trial court's decision to direct Fairchild's verdict on comparative\r\n  negligence.Â  The decision of the trial court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Marilee Fairchild's husband, Larry, was voluntarily\r\n  dismissed as a party to the civil action prior to the commencement of trial.Â \r\n  Therefore, for purposes of this opinion when we refer to Fairchild we reference\r\n  Marilee Fairchild only.\r\n[2] The trial court reduced the jury's award to $715,000\r\n  after determining the award should be offset by $5,000 from a prior\r\n  settlement.Â  \r\n[3] Jury instructions are written as they appear in the\r\n  Record on Appeal.Â  \r\n[4] Our ruling does not indicate the trial court was\r\n  required to instruct the jury on all requested charges.Â  Because of their\r\n  similarity, such a charge could be repetitive.Â  It is within the trial court's\r\n  discretion to determine which charges are relevant given the evidence\r\n  presented.Â Â  \r\n[5] Â Fairchild argues Palmer lacks standing to appeal the\r\n  trial court's ruling on the motion for an IME because he is not an aggrieved\r\n  party.Â  Specifically, Fairchild contends Palmer was not denied a\r\n  personal right by the trial court because the court granted him the right to an\r\n  IME of Fairchild, and because Palmer was not entitled to have the IME performed\r\n  by a specific physician.Â  Fairchild relies on Rule 201(b), SCACR, which\r\n  states &quot;only a party aggrieved by an order, judgment, sentence or decision\r\n  may appeal.&quot;Â  Fairchild also relies on First Union National Bank of\r\n    South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 565, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  in which this court found:\r\nAn\r\n  aggrieved party is one who is aggrieved by the judgment or decree when it\r\n  operates on his rights of property or bears directly on his interest, the word\r\n  aggrieved referring to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or\r\n  property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden or obligation. A party\r\n  cannot appeal from a decision which does not affect his interest, however\r\n  erroneous and prejudicial it may be to the rights and interests of some other\r\n  person.\r\nFairchild's argument lacks\r\n  merit because the trial court's denial of Palmer's motion for an IME by Dr.\r\n  Ballenger &quot;bears directly on his interest.&quot;\r\n[6] Â The second paragraph of Rule 35, SCRCP, is not a\r\n  part of the federal rule.Â  \r\n[7] Â Fairchild argues Palmer failed to make a proper\r\n  post-trial motion, and therefore, the comparative negligence issue is not\r\n  properly before the court.Â  Specifically, Fairchild maintains Palmer\r\n  never asked the trial court for a new trial or cited any error with respect to\r\n  its ruling on comparative negligence.Â  At the close of the evidence, the trial\r\n  court granted Fairchild's motion for a directed verdict.Â  We believe\r\n  this issue is properly before the court because it was raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4612","title":"Oaks v.

Heyward Clarkson, III, and John Harjehausen, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Â Ten Woodruff Oaks, LLC (TWO) brought\r\n  this action seeking, among other relief, a declaration that it was the owner of\r\n  an easement across property belonging to Point Development, LLC (Point).Â \r\n  Following a hearing, the Greenville County Master-in-Equity found (1) Point's\r\n  predecessor-in-title had granted an easement to TWO across the subject\r\n  property; and (2) Point was bound by the grant.Â  Point appeals the master's\r\n  rulings.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCICC\r\n  Associates (CICC), which is not involved in this appeal, was the owner and\r\n  developer of 270 acres of land located in Greenville County at New Woodruff\r\n  Road and I-85.Â  In 1998, Guy Kathe became president of the entity that was the\r\n  general partner of CICC.Â  Gilles Helou was a limited partner in CICC, and his\r\narchitectural firm was a design consultant for the development project. \r\nIn 1964, a prior owner of the CICC property granted to\r\n  Piedmont Natural Gas an easement for a gas booster station and a right of\r\n  ingress and egress to the station.Â  These conveyances were recorded in\r\n  Greenville County; however, the public record does not indicate any corresponding\r\n  plats were filed.Â  The agreement on record refers to a right-of-way and\r\n  easement of &quot;ten feet (10') in width except for the site of the proposed\r\n  regulator station . . . .&quot;\r\nÂ Soon after CICC purchased its property, TWO purchased an\r\n  adjoining parcel on which a 12,000-square-foot industrial warehouse was located.\r\n  Â TWO's property was located at the corner of Woodruff Oaks Lane and Old\r\n  Woodruff Road.\r\nOld Woodruff Road, then a public\r\n  right-of-way controlled by the State of South Carolina, traversed CICC's\r\n  property, TWO's property, and property owned by Hollingsworth Funds, Inc. Â In\r\n  conjunction with CICC's effort to develop its property, Kathe contacted TWO and\r\n  Hollingsworth about closing Old Woodruff Road.Â  On December 2, 1998, CICC and\r\n  TWO entered into a &quot;letter agreement&quot; from CICC addressed to John\r\n  Fort, a principal of TWO. Â Under this agreement, CICC would grant an easement\r\n  allowing travel from a new boulevard, later named Market Point Drive, to the\r\n  Piedmont Natural Gas booster station.Â  In return, TWO would establish an\r\n  ingress and egress easement between Woodruff Oaks Lane and the Piedmont Natural\r\n  Gas booster station.Â  The two easements were to overlap in front of the booster\r\n  station.Â  On January 14, 1999, the letter agreement was signed by Kathe on\r\n  behalf of CICC and Fort on behalf of TWO.\r\nAccording to the letter agreement, CICC\r\n  would prepare the necessary documents for recognition of the easement and for\r\n  relinquishment of public maintenance of Old Woodruff Road.Â  On January 22,\r\n  1999, an application was made to the Greenville County Engineering Division requesting\r\n  the County's relinquishment of the maintenance of Old Woodruff Road.Â  Both\r\n  Kathe and Fort signed the application on behalf of their respective principals. \r\nCICC began construction of Market Point\r\n  Drive in 1999.Â  Soon after, the curbs and median on the road were installed.Â \r\n  During this time, CICC had ingress and egress access over TWO's property as\r\n  provided in the letter agreement.Â  When the road was constructed, a curb cut\r\n  was included for the 25-foot easement.\r\nOn\r\n  April 30, 1999, CICC recorded with the Greenville County Register of Deeds\r\n  Office a subdivision plat of its property showing a 25-foot non-exclusive easement\r\n  for ingress and egress.Â  According to Kathe, the filing of the plat was\r\n  intended to effect the abandonment of Old Woodruff Road and to supply ingress\r\n  and egress access from Woodruff Oaks Lane to Market Point Drive. Â Furthermore,\r\n  it was Kathe's understanding that the recorded plat established the easement as\r\n  described in the letter agreement.Â  Likewise, Fort testified this plat\r\n  reflected what he and Kathe had agreed to regarding the abandonment of Old\r\n  Woodruff Road in exchange for the nonexclusive easement that TWO would receive for\r\n  access between Woodruff Oaks Lane to Market Point Drive.\r\nOn August 19, 1999, after CICC deeded a\r\n  portion of its property to REEF Capital, a revised plat was recorded.Â  This\r\n  plat showed the same 25-foot ingress and egress easement that appeared on the\r\n  plat filed on April 30, 1999.Â  On March 15, 2001, CICC recorded another plat\r\n  for &quot;The Point, Phase I&quot; commercial development that also showed the\r\n  easement.\r\nNeither TWO nor CICC ever followed through\r\n  with preparing, signing, or recording any easement agreements or deeds of\r\n  easement.; however, according to Kathe, there was never a recorded plat that\r\n  did not show the easement.\r\nIn\r\n  early 2003, Kathe left CICC.Â  Thereafter, Helou, who was licensed as an\r\n  architect in Europe and had advised CICC on architectural issues, took over as\r\n  general partner of CICC.Â  On March 17, 2003, CICC sold a portion of its\r\n  property to Point, a limited liability company owned by Helou and two other\r\n  individuals.Â  \r\nThe deed to Point expressly incorporated\r\n  the plat recorded by CICC on March 15, 2001, which included the ingress and egress\r\n  easement.Â  The reference to the plat appears in a section on the deed entitled\r\n  &quot;Less and Excepting Therefrom,&quot; which also contains the familiar\r\n  disclaimer that &quot;This conveyance is made subject to all restrictions,\r\n  setback lines, zoning ordinances, utility easements and rights of way, if any,\r\n  as may appear of record or on the subject property.&quot;\r\nShortly after the conveyance to Point, a Bob Evans\r\n  restaurant was constructed on a lot in the subdivision.Â  An easement to\r\n  accommodate the restaurant sign was granted and recorded on May 11, 2004, and\r\n  was accompanied by a plat showing the ingress and egress easement.\r\nIn the fall of 2005, because of increased traffic on New\r\n  Woodruff Road resulting from nearby commercial development, TWO decided to pave\r\n  the easement. Â On October 24, 2005, counsel for Point notified TWO's attorney\r\n  by letter that Point was taking the position that the easement shown on the\r\n  various plats &quot;was merely to denote the access route for the gas regulator\r\n  station.&quot;Â  The attorney also warned that any attempt by TWO to make road\r\n  improvements in that location would be treated as a trespass.\r\nOn November 9, 2005, TWO filed this action against\r\n  Point, Piedmont Natural Gas Company, and other defendants not involved in this\r\n  appeal, seeking a declaratory judgment of ownership rights to the easement.Â \r\n  TWO also sought damages against Point for interference with property rights and\r\n  injunctive relief to secure the use and enjoyment of the easement.Â  On November\r\n  18, 2005, Point answered, generally denying the allegations in TWO's complaint.Â \r\n  TWO later amended its complaint to add causes of action against Point for\r\n  breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and abuse of process. Â \r\nThe\r\n  matter was later bifurcated for a jury trial on TWO's claims for damages and a\r\n  reference to the master to adjudicate TWO's other causes of action.Â  On May 18,\r\n  2007, the master held a hearing on TWO's equitable claims.Â  By order filed June\r\n  12, 2007, the master issued an order in which he concluded TWO had a\r\n  non-exclusive 25-foot private easement from Woodruff Oaks Lane across the\r\n  subject property and connecting with Market Point Drive.Â  The master further\r\n  found (1) the easement was an express easement by grant and was valid as to\r\n  subsequent purchasers without notice because it was set forth on recorded\r\n  plats; and (2) Point did not fulfill its burden to present clear and\r\n  unequivocal evidence that TWO abandoned the easement. Â After denial of\r\n  its motion to reconsider, Point filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in finding the letter agreement \r\n\t\t\tcreated an express easement by grant from CICC to\r\n  TWO?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in finding Point had \r\n\t\t\tconstructive notice of TWO's ownership rights in the\r\n  easement?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The determination of the existence of an easement\r\n  is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an any evidence standard\r\n  of review when tried by a judge without a jury.&quot;Â  Slear v. Hanna,\r\n  329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  A finding concerning notice,\r\n  however, is reviewed to determine if it is supported by the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Cf. Anderson v. Buonforte, 365 S.C. 482, 492, 617\r\n  S.E.2d 750, 755 (Ct. App. 2005) (upholding a special referee's finding\r\n  concerning actual notice as &quot;supported by the weight of the evidence\r\n  within the record&quot;).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Creation of an\r\n  Easement\r\nIn support of its position that an\r\n  easement from CICC to TWO was never created, Point contends that the letter\r\n  agreement that CICC and TWO signed was at best a contract evidencing the\r\n  parties' intent to create an easement upon the preparation and recording of various\r\n  legal documents.Â  Point further asserts CICC and TWO failed to follow through\r\n  on numerous issues that were either required or contemplated by the letter\r\n  agreement, such as the preparation of reciprocal easement agreements and a specific\r\n  description of the easement terms. Â We disagree.\r\n&quot;As a general rule, to constitute a\r\n  grant of an easement, any words clearly showing the intention to grant an\r\n  easement are sufficient.&quot; Â 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses Â§\r\n  15, at 512 (2004). Â &quot;Whether a grant in a written instrument creates an\r\n  easement and the type of easement created are to be determined by ascertaining\r\n  the intention of the parties as gathered from the language of the instrument;\r\n  the grant should be construed so as to carry out that intention.&quot;Â  Smith\r\n    v. Comm'rs of Pub. Works of City of Charleston, 312 S.C. 460, 466, 441\r\n  S.E.2d 331, 335 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  &quot;If the language is uncertain or\r\n  ambiguous in any respect, all the surrounding circumstances, including the\r\n  construction which the parties have placed on the language, may be considered\r\n  by the court, to the end that the intention of the parties may be ascertained\r\n  and given effect.&quot;Â  25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements Â§ 18, at 516 (2004).[1]\r\nWe recognize the letter agreement has\r\n  language suggesting the agreement to establish an easement could be executory\r\n  in nature; however, contrary to what Point argues, this language does not\r\n  indicate the easement CICC intended to grant to TWO was contingent on the\r\n  completion of the various tasks enumerated in the letter.Â  As a practical\r\n  matter, enjoyment of the interest would require physical preparation of the\r\n  grounds subject to the easement, and legal work would have been necessary to\r\n  ensure that the easement remained enforceable as to subsequent title holders of\r\n  the estates involved.[2] Â Moreover, preliminary work for the easement had in fact begun, including the\r\n  closing of Old Woodruff Road, construction on Market Point Drive, and the installation\r\n  of the curbs and median on the road soon after.Â  For these reasons, we reject\r\n  Point's contention that the letter agreement unambiguously expressed that it did\r\n  not constitute the grant or creation of an easement. Â \r\nThe master found &quot;that the letter\r\n  evidenced CICC's express grant of an easement across its property allowing the\r\n  adjoining landowners to travel from Woodruff Oaks Lane to Market Point\r\n  Drive.&quot; Â In making this finding, the master noted he relied on the\r\n  testimony of both Kathe and Fort, both of whom were sophisticated individuals\r\n  with substantial business experience and testified to the effect that access\r\n  rights over CICC's property were effective as of April 30, 1999, when CICC\r\n  recorded a plat showing the easement as a 25-foot non-exclusive ingress and egress\r\n  easement.Â  Furthermore, the abandonment of Old Woodruff Road resulted in\r\n  substantial benefit to CICC both in the form of more saleable land for\r\n  individual lots and in the fact that negotiation of the abandonment required an\r\n  agreement with only TWO rather than with a variety of property owners.Â  In\r\n  addition, construction of Market Point Drive began in 1999, and a curb cut was\r\n  included for the 25-foot easement.Â  Finally, there appears to be no dispute\r\n  CICC received ingress and egress access across TWO's property as contemplated\r\n  in the letter agreement and exercised this right.Â  Thus the alleged\r\n  deficiencies cited by Point are not sufficient reason to reverse the master's\r\n  finding that CICC made an express grant of an easement across its property\r\n  allowing travel from Woodruff Oaks Lane to Market Point Drive.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the master\r\n  correctly relied on evidence outside the letter agreement in determining the\r\n  effect of the agreement.Â  We also hold this evidence supports the master's\r\n  interpretation of the agreement as one creating an easement interest rather\r\n  than as an expression of the intent to do so upon the satisfaction of certain\r\n  terms.\r\nII.&nbsp; Constructive Notice\r\nPoint next contends that even if the\r\n  letter agreement is deemed sufficient to constitute the express grant of an\r\n  easement from CICC to TWO, the master erred in finding the plat on record that\r\n  was incorporated into Point's deed was sufficient notice of TWO's purported\r\n  easement.Â  Specifically, Point advances the following arguments: Â (1) the\r\n  master incorrectly relied on authority concerning actual rather than\r\n  constructive notice of an easement; (2) the easement granted to Piedmont\r\n  Natural Gas in 1964, which was properly prepared and recorded, explained the\r\n  presence of the platted ingress and egress easement referenced in Point's deed;\r\n  and (3) the master's decision is untenable from a policy standpoint because it\r\n  rewards TWO for its failure to follow through on the letter agreement and\r\n  punishes Point for relying on properly recorded documents.Â  We disagree with\r\n  these arguments.\r\n&quot;[C]onstructive notice or inquiry\r\n  notice in the context of a real estate transaction often is grounded in an\r\n  examination of the public record because it is the proper recording of\r\n  documents asserting an interest or claim in real property which gives\r\n  constructive notice to the world.&quot;Â  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106,\r\n  119, 628 S.E.2d 869, 876 (2006).Â  Constructive notice, however, is not limited\r\n  to what is ascertainable from consulting public records.Â  As the supreme court\r\n  has explained:Â  \r\nConstructive or inquiry notice in the\r\n  context of a real estate transaction also may arise when a party becomes\r\n  aware or should have become aware of certain facts which, if investigated,\r\n  would reveal the claim of another.Â  The party will be charged by operation of\r\n  law with all knowledge that an investigation by a reasonably cautious\r\n  and prudent purchaser would have revealed.\r\nId. at 120,\r\n  628 S.E.2d at 876 (emphases added).Â  In making these statements, the court\r\n  emphasized &quot; 'the principle that the party is bound to the exercise of due\r\n  diligence, and is assumed to have the knowledge to which that diligence would\r\n  lead him,' &quot; noting also that &quot; '[t]here must appear to be, in the\r\n    nature of the case, such a connection between the facts disclosed and\r\n  further facts to be discovered, that the former could justly be viewed as\r\n  furnishing a clue to the latter.' &quot;Â  Id. at 120-21, 628 S.E.2d at 876\r\n  (quoting Black v. Childs, 14 S.C. 312, 321-22 (1880)) (emphasis added).Â  Cf. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54,\r\n  64-65, 504 S.E.2d 117, 123 (1998) (noting that under South Carolina case law\r\n  implied actual notice is classified as constructive notice because of the duty\r\n  to inquire).\r\nPoint correctly notes the master never expressly found\r\n  it had actual notice of the easement and that Frierson v. Watson, 371\r\n  S.C. 60, 636 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2006), one of the decisions on which the\r\n  master relied in finding the recorded plats referenced in its deed provided\r\n  adequate notice, concerned actual rather than constructive notice of an\r\n  easement.Â  Whether or not Frierson supports the master's decision\r\n  regarding constructive notice, the facts of this case support a finding that\r\n  Point could be charged with inquiry notice of the easement notwithstanding the\r\n  alleged deficiencies in the public record.\r\nThe conveyance from CICC to Point was &quot;subject to\r\n  all restrictions, setback lines, zoning ordinances, utility easements and\r\n  rights of way, if any, as may appear of record or on the subject property.&quot;Â \r\n  The deed expressly referenced a plat showing a 25-foot non-exclusive ingress\r\n  and egress easement.Â  That plat expressly indicated the easement was\r\n  non-exclusive and specified its width, length, and location.Â  The deed of\r\n  conveyance itself, therefore, provided inquiry notice to Point of the\r\n  encumbrance.Â  See Carolina Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 105,\r\n  217 S.E.2d 16, 19 (1975) (&quot;[W]here a deed describes land as is shown as a\r\n  certain plat, such becomes a part of the deed.&quot;).Â  Subsequent conveyances also\r\n  referenced plats showing the same easement.Â  \r\nBecause constructive notice is not necessarily confined\r\n  to the public record, we disagree with Point's argument that its belief that\r\n  the easement referred to in the plats was the recorded easement to Piedmont\r\n  Natural Gas was reasonable because &quot;there was no document whatsoever in\r\n  the public domain that would even remotely indicate that that easement was\r\n  anything other than the recorded [Piedmont Natural Gas] Ingress/Egress\r\n  Easement.&quot;Â  As noted in the appealed order, the 1964 deed referenced a 10-foot\r\n  easement and the subsequent plats show a 25-foot non-exclusive ingress and\r\n  egress easement.Â  Even if we accept Point's apparent position that the\r\n  discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the 1964 deed granted Piedmont\r\n  Natural Gas both a pipeline easement and an access easement, this explanation\r\n  is at best plausible rather than conclusive.Â  It did not absolve Point of the\r\n  responsibility to investigate whether the ingress and egress easement conveyed to\r\n  Piedmont Natural Gas in 1964 was in fact the same easement as that depicted in\r\n  the plat referenced in its deed.Â  \r\nAs the master noted, not only did CICC\r\n  file numerous plats including the one referenced in Point's deed depicting the\r\n  easement, it made a formal application to the Greenville County Engineering\r\n  Division for the relinquishment of maintenance of Old Woodruff Road and\r\n  recognition of the easement.Â  Furthermore, whether or not Helou had actual\r\n  notice of the easement, we cannot ignore that he had been a limited partner in\r\n  CICC since its formation in 1998 and took over the responsibilities of general\r\n  partner in 2003 after Kathe's departure.Â  According to the master, he also\r\n  &quot;executed on behalf of CICC the deed conveying title of 'The Point, Phase\r\n  I' development to his newly formed company Point Development, Inc.&quot;Â  Given\r\n  Helou's relationship with both CICC and Point, the contact with authorities\r\n  about matters related to the easement and the plats on record, we find it\r\n  unlikely that Point would not have had at its disposal the means for\r\n  ascertaining the ownership and nature of the easement at issue in this appeal.\r\nFinally, we reject Point's argument that\r\n  affirmance of the master's order would be against public policy.Â  As we have\r\n  emphasized, the determination of whether Point had constructive notice depends\r\n  on more than what public records can verify.Â  To the contrary, a resolution of\r\n  this question includes consideration of &quot;circumstances sufficient to put a\r\n  party upon the inquiry.&quot;Â  Black v. Childs, 14 S.C. 312, 321-22\r\n  (1880) (quoted in Spence, 358 S.C. at 120, 628 S.E.2d at 876).Â  Even\r\n  if we were to concede that TWO did not act promptly to perfect its easement,[3] we find no reason to believe that\r\n  this failure prevented Point from ascertaining the nature and extent of the\r\n  encumbrance depicted on the plat referenced in its deed.Â  Point's decision to\r\n  ignore such circumstances and rely solely on a title search cannot be viewed as\r\n  reasonable.Â  We therefore reject Point's argument that the master's decision to\r\n  uphold the easement is untenable from a policy standpoint.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the master's decision finding the letter\r\n  agreement of December 2, 1998, created an access easement from CICC to TWO.Â  We\r\n  further hold that the circumstances of this case support the master's finding\r\n  that Point had constructive notice of this easement.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In Smith, this Court cited to the same\r\n  principle as it appeared in an earlier edition of American Jurisprudence\r\n  Second.Â  Smith v.

Acts 470 (the Act).Â  The eight individual\r\n  districts, including District 20, called constituent districts, remained in\r\n  existence under the umbrella of the CCSD with the authority to control certain\r\n  aspects of the running of their own districts.Â  \r\nBuist Academy is a\r\n  county-wide magnet school established by the CCSD for intellectually gifted\r\n  children.Â  The school is physically located within the confines of District\r\n  20.Â  As of 2003, admission to Buist Academy was determined on the following\r\n  basis:Â  priority for one-fourth of available openings was given to students\r\n  residing in District 20; priority for another one-fourth of openings was reserved\r\n  for siblings of Buist Academy students; priority for one-fourth of openings was\r\n  given to students who would otherwise attend low-performing schools; and\r\n  priority for the final one-fourth of seats would be equal among students\r\n  county-wide.Â  The applications for the school have always exceeded the\r\n  available openings, and a lottery is used at the kindergarten level to select\r\n  students who will be tested to determine if they meet the academic requirements\r\n  for admission.Â  \r\nIn January 2006, the District 20 Board adopted a motion\r\n  giving priority for all seats to qualified students residing in District 20.Â  Any\r\n  remaining seats would be given to siblings of current Buist Academy students.Â  The\r\n  principal of Buist Academy, Sallie Ballard, appealed that action to the CCSD alleging\r\n  the District 20 Board did not have the authority to set attendance guidelines\r\n  for the school.Â  Principal Ballard was represented by CCSD's attorney, Alice\r\n  Paylor, and Paylor's services were paid for by CCSD.Â  Additionally, Paylor had\r\n  recently represented the CCSD Chairperson, Nancy Cook, in a legal matter free\r\n  of charge.\r\nOn June 13, 2006, the CCSD began a hearing to consider\r\n  the propriety of the District 20 Board's action, but the hearing was adjourned.Â \r\n  The hearing was not reconvened until September 29, 2007.Â  In the interim, Appellants\r\n  filed an action seeking to require the CCSD to recognize the January 2006\r\n  motion changing the admission guidelines for Buist Academy.\r\nWhen the hearing before CCSD was resumed, the CCSD voted\r\n  that the January 2006 motion was null and void.Â  Appellants appealed that\r\n  outcome alleging the CCSD erred in declaring the January 2006 motion null and\r\n  void and that their due process rights were violated because Paylor worked for\r\n  CCSD and represented Ballard in her appeal to that body.Â  Following a bench\r\n  trial, the circuit court determined the CCSD Board had the authority to set the\r\n  attendance guidelines for Buist Academy and Appellants had received due process\r\n  during the hearing.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  this case, our standard of review is mixed.Â  Whether Act 340 empowered the District\r\n  20 Board to establish attendance guidelines for Buist Academy calls for\r\n  interpretation of the Act.Â  Statutory interpretation is a question of law for\r\n  the court to be made without any particular deference to the lower court.Â  Thompson\r\n    ex rel. Harvey v. Cisson Constr. Co., 377 S.C. 137, 154, 659 S.E.2d 171, 180\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008). Â Whether the hearing before the CCSD Board violated Appellants'\r\n  due process rights was a factual question before the circuit court.Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate\r\n  court will not disturb the circuit court's findings of fact unless no evidence\r\n  reasonably supports them.Â  Townes Assoc. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266\r\n  S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Attendance Policy\r\nAppellants contend the District 20 Board\r\n  has the authority to determine which students would attend Buist Academy pursuant\r\n  to Section 7(1) of the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In interpreting\r\n  statutes, the [c]ourt looks to the plain meaning of the statute and the intent\r\n  of the Legislature.&quot;Â  State v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 649, 659\r\n  S.E.2d 101, 105 (2008).Â  &quot;All rules of statutory construction are\r\n  subservient to the maxim that legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used.&quot;Â  State v. Pittman, 373\r\n  S.C. 527, 561, 647 S.E.2d 144, 161 (2007). Â In ascertaining that intent, the &quot;court should not\r\n  focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of\r\n  the statute as a whole.&quot;Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v.\r\n    Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996). \r\nHere, each party claims authority to set\r\n  attendance guidelines for Buist Academy under different sections of the Act.Â  Appellants contend the District 20 Board should set\r\n  admissions guidelines at Buist Academy because it has authority to\r\n  &quot;determine the school within such constituent district in which any pupil\r\n  shall enroll.&quot;Â  Act No. 340, Â§ 7(1), 1967 S.C. Acts 470.Â  We interpret this language to mean a constituent\r\n  district may determine what school within that district a student who resides\r\n  in the district will attend.Â  Because Buist Academy's attendance zone is\r\n  county-wide, the authority given to a constituent district under section 7(1)\r\n  is not really implicated in this case as it does not involve the constituent\r\n  district making an assignment to a traditional neighborhood school.\r\nOn\r\n  the other hand, section 5(8) of the Act states the\r\n  CCSD has the authority to &quot;provide for intellectually gifted children a\r\n  program which shall challenge their talents.&quot;Â  Act No. 340, Â§ 5(8),\r\n  1967 S.C. Acts 470.Â  District 20 argues a\r\n  &quot;program&quot; and a &quot;school&quot; are not the same and the\r\n  legislature purposefully employed the terms to mean two different things.Â  While\r\n  the term program is not defined in the Act, we do not conclude the term program\r\n  cannot be interpreted to encompass the creation of a county-wide magnet school\r\n  such as Buist Academy.Â  It could likewise, as Appellants suggest, refer to the\r\n  establishment of a program within a pre-existing neighborhood school.[2]Â  \r\nStatutes dealing with the\r\n  same subject matter are to be construed together, if possible, to produce a\r\n  harmonious result.Â  Joiner ex rel Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).Â  The adoption of Appellants' interpretation of the Act\r\n  would be inconsistent with the authority given to CCSD under section 5(8).Â  Additionally, the\r\n  constituent districts only have the powers bestowed upon them by the Act in\r\n  Sections 6 and 7.Â  See Act No. 340, Â§\r\n  5, 1967 S.C. Acts 470 (&quot;In addition to the duties, powers and\r\n  responsibilities now provided by law for county boards of education, and for\r\n  school district trustees other than those devolved upon the constituent\r\n  trustees in Sections 6 and 7 of this act, the Board of the Charleston County School\r\n  District shall . . . .&quot;).Â  Those powers granted to the constituent\r\n  districts are subject to appeal to the CCSD.Â  See Act No. 340, Â§ 7, 1967 S.C. Acts 470 (&quot;The trustees in each\r\n  of the constituent districts shall have the power in their respective\r\n  districts, subject to the appeal to the Board of Trustees of the Charleston\r\n  County School District . . . .&quot;).Â  Therefore, because section 7(1) does\r\n  not empower the District 20 Board to set attendance guidelines at Buist\r\n  Academy, that authority is vested in the CCSD.\r\nOur adoption of Appellants'\r\n  position as to the Act would not seem to reflect legislative intent.Â  Placing all\r\n  emphasis on the physical location of a school such as Buist Academy would\r\n  permit a constituent school district to monopolize a county-wide magnet school\r\n  to the exclusion of all other students in the county.Â  That interpretation of\r\n  the Act leads to an absurd result unintended by the General Assembly.Â  See Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283\r\n  (2000) (&quot;We will reject a statutory\r\n  interpretation when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that\r\n  it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain\r\n  legislative intention.&quot;); Miller v. Lawrence Robinson Trucking,\r\n  333 S.C. 576, 582, 510 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;The\r\n  interpretation of a term set forth in a statute should support the statute and\r\n  should not lead to an absurd result.&quot;); see also TNS Mills, Inc.\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998) (&quot;Statutes,\r\n  as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation,\r\n  consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.&quot;).Â  Consequently,\r\n  we cannot adopt the interpretation of this statute proposed by Appellants, and\r\n  we conclude the circuit court properly found Act 340 grants the CCSD ultimate\r\n  authority with respect to setting admission criteria for Buist Academy.\r\nII.&nbsp; Due Process Rights\r\nAppellants further contend the conduct\r\n  of the hearing before the CCSD violated their due process rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court concluded the CCSD did\r\n  not waive its right to hear Ballard's appeal because of the delay in the\r\n  institution of the hearing in June 2006 and its resumption in September 2007.Â  The\r\n  record reflects the CCSD instructed the attorneys for both parties to set up a\r\n  time for reconvening the hearing.Â  This was not done.Â  Furthermore, the record\r\n  shows the CCSD and the District 20 Board were working on a compromise to\r\n  satisfy all parties during the hiatus, but those negotiations were ultimately\r\n  unsuccessful. Â The circuit court concluded Appellants should have filed a writ\r\n  of mandamus compelling the CCSD Board to act if the delay was unacceptable.[3]Â \r\n  While a writ of mandamus may or may not have been the proper procedural step\r\n  for Appellants, the record shows the delay in reconvening the hearing was at\r\n  least in part due to the ongoing negotiations between the two school boards and\r\n  the failure of both parties to pursue rescheduling the matter.Â  In addition,\r\n  the record shows all the qualified students from District 20 who sought\r\n  admission to kindergarten in 2007 were admitted.Â  So any delay, regardless of cause,\r\n  did not clearly prejudice District 20 students.[4]Â \r\n  Under those circumstances, the record supports the circuit court's conclusion\r\n  that the delay did not violate Appellants' rights.\r\nThe circuit\r\n  court found Appellants presented no evidence of substantial prejudice created\r\n  by Paylor's prior representation of Cook.[5]Â  See Felder v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 327 S.C. 21, 26, 489\r\n  S.E.2d 191, 193 (1997) (&quot;Substantial prejudice is required to establish a\r\n  violation of due process.&quot;).Â  Likewise, the circuit court found no\r\n  evidence Paylor had advised the CCSD Board while representing Ballard in the\r\n  hearing before it.Â  See Rule 1.8(l), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR (&quot;In any adversarial proceeding, a lawyer shall not\r\n  serve as both an advocate and an advisor to the hearing officer, trial judge or\r\n  trier of fact.&quot;).Â  We find the circuit court's conclusions are supported\r\n  by the record.\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the\r\n  ruling of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] District 20 is comprised of the peninsular area of\r\n  Charleston County.\r\n[2] In a similar vein, the CCSD\r\n  administers programs for handicapped students on an interdistrict basis based\r\n  on the authority given in section 5.Â  See Act No. 340, Â§ 5(8), 1967 S.C.\r\n  Acts 470 (&quot;The CCSD shall [p]rovide for physically and mentally\r\n  handicapped children educational programs organized and conducted in\r\n  cooperation with the social or civic organizations and agencies in the county\r\n  or community.&quot;).\r\n[3] &quot;The primary purpose of a writ of mandamus is to\r\n  enforce an established right and to enforce a corresponding imperative duty\r\n  created or imposed by law.&quot;Â  Wilson v. Preston, 378 S.C. 348, 353,\r\n  662 S.E.2d 580, 583 (2008).\r\n[4] Testimony in the record shows that two first-graders high\r\n  on the waiting list for District 20 students may have been admitted in 2007\r\n  under the policy adopted by the District 20 Board provided vacancies became\r\n  available.\r\n[5] While the circuit court's conclusions are supported\r\n  by the record, we caution elected officials and attorneys to avoid even the\r\n  appearance of impropriety in matters of public concern.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4614","title":"US Bank Trust National Association v.

Â We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\n In 2001, Bank\r\n  commenced a foreclosure action against the Bells' property, resulting in a\r\n  judgment of foreclosure dated July 17, 2002.Â  On August 2, 2002, the day before\r\n  the scheduled foreclosure sale, the Bells called Chase Home Finance, LLC\r\n  (Chase), the servicing agent for Bank, and spoke with Anita Gaines (now known\r\n  as Anita Stokes).Â  Stokes was a foreclosure analyst for Chase.Â  During the\r\n  telephone conversation, the Bells negotiated with Stokes to stop the\r\n  foreclosure sale and to reinstate the loan by entering into a payment\r\n  agreement.Â  The parties do not dispute the existence of the reinstatement agreement;\r\n  they dispute the due date of the second lump sum payment under that agreement.\r\nUnder the\r\n  reinstatement agreement, the Bells agreed to pay two lump sum payments totaling\r\n  $67,570.85, and also agreed to begin monthly payments.Â  Stokes\r\n  testified the first payment of $30,000 was to be paid immediately upon\r\n  execution of the reinstatement agreement and the remaining balance was to be\r\n  paid ninety days from the entry of the reinstatement agreement, which was\r\n  November 2, 2002. Â Stokes further testified she did not have the authority to\r\n  extend the time for payment beyond ninety days.Â  On the other hand, the Bells\r\n  testified the agreement required the initial payment indicated and also\r\n  required a second payment of $37,570.85 to be paid within twelve months from\r\n  the entry of the reinstatement agreement.Â  \r\nStokes\r\n  stated she did not presently know the whereabouts of the document containing\r\n  the reinstatement agreement; Bank did not produce the document at trial.Â  Stokes\r\n  claimed she placed the document containing the agreement in the Bells' file and\r\n  at some point transferred the file to Joseph Bryan.Â  According to Stokes, Bryan\r\n  gave the file to his manager, who unexpectedly died, resulting in the\r\n  document's misplacement.Â  \r\nAround\r\n  the time the reinstatement agreement was reached, Stokes made a record\r\n  referencing the agreement in a computerized recordkeeping database known as\r\n  FORTRACS History Notes.[1]Â \r\n  The FORTRACS notes were introduced into the record as evidence without\r\n  objection.Â  Stokes' note provided, in pertinent part:\r\nI\r\n  spoke to [Mr. Bell] and he stated that there was an error in the e-mail that I\r\n  had received. He is asking to pay thirty thousand dollars now and have the\r\n  remainder of the money in ninety days. He'll be paying his regular payment of\r\n  $2,134.52 for the months of September and October.Â  November 2, 2002[,] he will\r\n  have the remainder of the reinstatement funds, attorney fees[,] and cost. \r\nStokes testified\r\n  she reduced the agreement to writing and sent it to the Bells via e-mail.Â \r\n  Stokes asserted she later called the Bells, whereby they allegedly agreed to\r\n  the terms, signed the document, and returned it to Stokes by facsimile.Â  The\r\n  Bells testified they had no notes or other documents to support their assertion\r\n  that the second lump sum payment was due in August 2003. \r\nOn\r\n  August 12, 2002, the Bells made the first payment of $30,000, which Bank\r\n  accepted and eventually applied to the loan.Â  Additionally, the regular monthly\r\n  payments the Bells agreed to continue making were received in September,\r\n  October, and November.Â  \r\nOn November 1,\r\n  2002, after the initial monthly payments had been made, Stokes indicated she\r\n  spoke with Mr. Bell.Â  The note of her conversation provides, &quot;[s]poke to\r\n  Mr. Bell . . . he would be sending the rest of the reinstatement funds by\r\n  11/15/2002 [totaling $39,196.31].&quot;Â  On November 26, 2002, Stokes noted she\r\n  again spoke with Mr. Bell and he stated his check was being held up, but\r\n  promised it would arrive on December 5, 2002.Â  The note continues, &quot;[h]e\r\n  will [overnight] a check to us on 12/7/2002.&quot;Â  Stokes testified the delay\r\n  was allegedly due to the fact Mr. Bell was expecting some of his merchandise to\r\n  be sold. \r\nStokes\r\n  testified the Bells did not make the payment allegedly due by December 7,\r\n  2002.Â  Stokes claimed she proceeded to call the Bells on two separate occasions\r\n  (December 18, 2002, and January 16, 2003), leaving voice messages each time.Â \r\n  Stokes also testified the Bells failed to make the monthly payments for December\r\n  2002 and January 2003.Â  Stokes stated that on January 18, 2003, Mr. Bell\r\n  claimed he sent in the December and January monthly payments; however, there\r\n  were no records the payments were received. Â Moreover, the Bells never\r\n  presented any documents or other evidence as to these missed monthly payments. Â During\r\n  the same telephone conversation on January 18, 2003, Stokes also mentioned to\r\n  Mr. Bell that she &quot;would be getting all the funds posted to his account\r\n  and sent out a new referral to start a new foreclosure action unless he can\r\n  reinstate his account.&quot;Â  Notwithstanding, Stokes entered a note in\r\n  FORTRACS indicating the Bells' loan was fully reinstated as of February 7,\r\n  2003; Stokes subsequently testified as to the reason for the notation.\r\nBank renewed\r\n  its foreclosure action in May 2003.Â  On June 30, 2003, Bank filed an amended\r\n  complaint.Â  In the amended complaint, Bank alleged the amount due and owing on\r\n  the promissory note (the Note) and mortgage was $233,386.37 plus interest at a\r\n  rate of nine percent per annum from July 1, 2001, plus attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  The Bells denied this allegation.Â  Additionally, the Bells testified\r\n  they did not tender the second lump sum payment by August 2003 because Bank had\r\n  already renewed its foreclosure action and because Bank was returning the\r\n  Bells' monthly mortgage checks.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Bells' answer to the foreclosure action asserted several defenses and two\r\n  counterclaims, one for breach of contract and the other for promissory\r\n  estoppel.[2]Â \r\n  The Bells admitted they executed the Note in the original principal amount of\r\n  $243,200.00 and a mortgage securing the Note, constituting a lien on the\r\n  property.Â  \r\nMr. Bell\r\n  testified Bank started returning the monthly payments in February 2003, citing\r\n  insufficient funds to cure default.Â  Mr. Bell further testified the Bells\r\n  continued to make payments every month thereafter until filing for bankruptcy\r\n  protection in October 2005, despite Bank's rejection of the monthly payments.[3]Â  While\r\n  asserting he continued to make monthly payments until October 2005, Bell never\r\n  tendered the second lump sum payment even by the date he contends it was due.\r\nOn\r\n  October 15, 2005, Mr. Bell declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and notice of the\r\n  bankruptcy was filed in Bank's foreclosure action against Mr. Bell on December\r\n  19, 2005. Â On October 19, 2006, Bank and the bankruptcy trustee settled Mr.\r\n  Bell's interest in the counterclaims asserted against the Bank in the state\r\n  court foreclosure action.[4]Â Â \r\n  After Mr. Bell's bankruptcy case was closed, the foreclosure action was restored\r\n  to the active docket on March 28, 2007, pursuant to Bank's motion under Rule 40(j),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master-in-equity for York County presided over the nonjury trial in the\r\n  foreclosure action.Â  In his final order, the master-in-equity refused to allow the\r\n  foreclosure to proceed because Bank had failed to carry its burden of proving that\r\n  the terms of the reinstatement agreement required the second lump sum payment\r\n  to be made in November 2002.Â  In support of the decision, the master-in-equity\r\n  cited Bank's own annotation that the loan was fully reinstated as of February\r\n  2003.Â  Additionally, due to Bank's alleged repudiation of the agreement and subsequent\r\n  rejection of Mr. Bell's monthly payment checks, the master-in-equity determined\r\n  the Bells were not required to continue making payments to Bank because they\r\n  were not required to perform useless acts.Â  Finally, the master-in-equity\r\n  modified the Note by adding the accrued, but unpaid interest, and the escrow\r\n  funds to the principal balance, resulting in a new balance of $394,550.99.Â  The\r\n  net effect of this remedy was to increase the outstanding principal balance.Â \r\n  The master-in-equity allowed the Bells to repay the new principal balance with\r\n  interest at the rate set forth in the Note[5] in monthly installments over the remaining term of the loan.[6]\r\nThe\r\n  Bells filed a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, wherein they asserted the\r\n  following: (1) the award of accrued interest on payments which were made by the\r\n  Bells and rejected by Bank was not supported by the evidence or applicable\r\n  authority; (2) because Bank's rejection of the Bells' payments was wrongful,\r\n  increasing the Bells' payments by $2,000 per month over the payment required by\r\n  the original Note was not supported by the record; (3) the finding that Mr.\r\n  Bell admitted to missing the December 2002 and the January 2003 payments was\r\n  not supported by the record; and (4) the amount of the escrow balance was not\r\n  supported by the record.Â  In response, the master-in-equity entered a\r\n  supplemental order.[7]Â \r\n  In this order, the master-in-equity found Bank was not entitled to the accrued\r\n  interest of $126,080.68 added to the principal balance.Â  Notwithstanding, the\r\n  master-in-equity added the second lump sum payment of $37,570.85 to the\r\n  principal because the Bells did not make this payment as required by the\r\n  reinstatement agreement.Â  The net effect of these adjustments was to reduce the\r\n  outstanding principal balance to $306,041.16 and to reduce the monthly payment\r\n  from $3,629.79 to $2,815.52.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n      Did the master-in-equity err in ruling Bank had not\r\n        proven the Bells were in default on their loan?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n      Did the master-in-equity err in restructuring the\r\n        loan and modifying the terms of payment without the consent of Bank?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n      Did the master-in-equity err in ruling Bank was not\r\n        entitled to collect interest accrued on the loan?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      IV.\r\n       Did the master-in-equity err in ruling Bank was not\r\n        entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in attempting to collect the loan?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A\r\n  mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity.&quot;Â  Hayne Fed. Credit Union\r\n  v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997). Â In an appeal\r\n  from an action in equity, tried by a judge alone, we may find facts in\r\n  accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.[8]Â  Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. Charleston S. Univ., 376 S.C. 399,\r\n  407, 656 S.E.2d 775, 779 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;However, this broad scope of\r\n  review does not require an appellate court to disregard the findings below or\r\n  ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better position to assess the\r\n  credibility of the witnesses.&quot; Â Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382,\r\n  387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001). Â &quot;Moreover, the appellant is not relieved\r\n  of his burden of convincing\r\n  the appellate court the trial judge committed error in his findings.&quot;Â  Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d at 623.\r\nÂ Additionally, &quot;[a] legal question in an equity\r\n  case receives review as in law.&quot; Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003). Â Because questions of law may be decided with no\r\n  particular deference to the trial court, this court may correct errors of law in both legal and equitable\r\n  actions. Â I'On, LLC v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 1998)).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBank first\r\n  asserts the master-in-equity erred in ruling Bank had failed to prove the Bells\r\n  were in default on their loan.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  mortgage and a note are separate securities for the same debt, and a mortgagee\r\n  who has a note and a mortgage to\r\n  secure a debt has the option to either bring an action on the note\r\n  or to pursue a foreclosure action. \r\n  Lever v. Lighting Galleries, Inc., 374 S.C. 30, 33, 647 S.E.2d 214,\r\n  216&nbsp;(2007).Â  Any modification of a written contract must satisfy all\r\n  fundamental elements of a valid contract in order for it to be enforceable,\r\n  including a meeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all\r\n  essential terms of the agreement.Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101,\r\n  104-05, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989).Â  Thus, &quot;[w]hile a written contract can\r\n  be orally modified, there must be a meeting of the minds as to the\r\n  modification.&quot;Â  First Union Mortgage Corp. v. Thomas, 317 S.C. 63,\r\n  70, 451 S.E.2d 907, 912 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\nHere, the\r\n  existence of the reinstatement agreement is undisputed; instead, the parties\r\n  dispute when the second lump sum payment was due.Â  When interpreting an oral\r\n  contract, a court must give effect to the intentions of the parties. Â Keith\r\n  v. River Consulting, Inc., 365 S.C. 500, 506, 618 S.E.2d 302, 305 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) (citing Columbia E. Assoc. v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 299 S.C. 515, 519, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 259, 261 (1989)). Â The determination of the parties' intent is a\r\n  question of fact.Â  S. Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 349 S.C. 77, 81,\r\n  562 S.E.2d 482, 485 (Ct. App. 2002). Â To give effect to the parties'\r\n  intentions, the court will endeavor to determine the situation of the parties\r\n  and their purposes at the time the contract was entered.Â  Keith, 365\r\n  S.C. at 506, 618 S.E.2d at 305 (quoting Columbia E. Assoc., 299 S.C. at 519,\r\n  386 S.E.2d at 261).Â  When a contract is silent as to a particular matter, parol\r\n  evidence is admissible to reveal the intent of the parties.Â  Id.Â  \r\nGenerally, the\r\n  party seeking foreclosure has the burden of establishing the existence of the\r\n  debt and the mortgagor's default on that debt.[9]Â \r\n  Once the debt and default have been established, the mortgagor has the burden\r\n  of establishing a defense to foreclosure such as lack of consideration,\r\n  payment, or accord and satisfaction.Â  See Bandy v. Bandy, 187\r\n  S.C. 410, 413, 197 S.E. 396, 397 (1938) (holding the burden was on defendant in\r\n  mortgage foreclosure suit to establish her defense that mortgage and note\r\n  secured thereby were without valuable consideration by preponderance of\r\n  evidence).\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the master-in-equity concluded Bank failed to carry its burden of proving\r\n  the second lump sum payment was due in November 2002, and also accepted the\r\n  terms of the reinstatement agreement as asserted by Mr. Bell.Â  However, taking\r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we respectfully disagree,\r\n  and find that the preponderance of the evidence in the record establishes\r\n  default.\r\nStokes\r\n  testified that the reinstatement agreement between Bank and the Bells provided\r\n  the following:Â  (1) the Bells would make the first lump sum payment of $30,000\r\n  immediately (August 2002); (2) the Bells would make a second lump sum payment\r\n  of $37,570.85 in ninety days (November 2002); and (3) the Bellsâ€™ monthly\r\n  payments on the mortgage would increase to $2,134.52 beginning in September.Â \r\n  Stokes corroborated her testimony with several entries in the FORTRACS system,\r\n  which she contemporaneously made after telephone conversations with the Bells.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Stokes also testified that she was without authority to extend the\r\n  time for repayment beyond the ninety days allegedly agreed to in the\r\n  reinstatement agreement.\r\nThe\r\n  master-in-equity relied on a contradictory notation in Bank's FORTRACS system indicating\r\n  the loan was fully reinstated as of February 7, 2003, which, upon a cursory\r\n  review, corroborated Mr. Bell's testimony.Â  Notwithstanding, Stokes explained\r\n  the alleged discrepancy in her testimony:\r\nBack\r\n  in 2002 FORTRACS was a new system that we received, and it was still in a\r\n  tweaking process and back then when we wanted a file to go back to collections\r\n  . . . and sent to a new foreclosure, we had to close it out of this system, and\r\n  that was the only way of closing out is to put loan reinstated or loan paid off\r\n  and we didn't want to put loan paid off, so we used reinstated so it can go\r\n  back to the proper channels to be referred back to a foreclosure attorney.\r\nNothing in the record was\r\n  presented to dispute this explanation.Â  Moreover, the master-in-equity failed\r\n  to consider that even the Bells were not asserting that the loan was fully\r\n  reinstated as of February 2003.Â  Under the Bells' own version, the loan would\r\n  not have been current until August 2003.Â  Stokes' explanation for the\r\n  irregularity demonstrates that the entry actually conforms to Bank's position\r\n  on the default. In fact, Stokes further testified that this action was the\r\n  necessary entry to make in the FORTRACS system at that time for all accounts\r\n  being referred to an attorney for collection.\r\nFurther,\r\n  Mr. Bell agreed with several statements made by Stokes.Â  For example, Mr. Bell acknowledged\r\n  having numerous telephone conversations with Stokes over &quot;the next couple\r\n  of months&quot; regarding the agreement and to &quot;get the numbers together .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  Moreover, although Mr. Bell denied having told Stokes the full\r\n  amount of the balance due would be paid in November 2002 or December 2002, he\r\n  conceded he never tendered the second lump sum payment. Â Consequently, Bank\r\n  took the positive steps necessary to foreclose on the Bells' account due to the\r\n  Bells' failure to timely pay the second lump sum under the reinstatement\r\n  agreement. Â Therefore, a finding of default based on the missed second lump sum\r\n  payment is supported by the record.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  as the master-in-equity determined in his findings of fact, the Bells missed\r\n  their regular monthly payments in December 2002 and January 2003 after the\r\n  reinstatement agreement was entered.[10]Â \r\n  These missed payments each constitute a default by the Bells.[11]\r\nThe letters\r\n  sent from Bank to the Bells rejecting attempted monthly payments, beginning\r\n  with the February 2003 payment, support Bank's position on default.Â  Bank never\r\n  sent a rejection of payment letter prior to February 2003.Â  Once the Bells were\r\n  deemed to be in default because of the missed November 2002 lump sum payment,\r\n  or by virtue of the missed December 2002 and January 2003 monthly payments, Bank\r\n  was under no obligation to accept any monthly payments in February or\r\n  thereafter; moreover, Bank's legal right to declare the entire balance due and right\r\n  to commence a foreclosure action could not be taken away or nullified by a\r\n  partial tender.[12] See Allendale Furniture Co. v. Carolina Commercial Bank, 284 S.C.\r\n  76, 79, 325 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1985); Dargan v. Metro. Props., Inc., 243\r\n  S.C. 324, 325, 133 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1963); see also Ford Motor Credit\r\n  Co. v. Morales, 279 S.C. 388, 390, 308 S.E.2d 102, 102&nbsp;(1983) (&quot;A\r\n  payment of a debt is not considered made until it is accepted by the creditor\r\n  with the intention of extinguishing the debt.&quot;). Â Each letter sent by Bank\r\n  rejecting an attempted monthly payment shows that the sum tendered was less\r\n  than the total amount due on its account to cure the default.\r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  a technical default, the Bells contend that they are excused from making\r\n  payments because they tendered monthly payments and the payments were\r\n  improperly rejected.Â  The master-in-equity concluded that the Bells were\r\n  absolved from tendering the second lump sum payment because such an act would\r\n  be useless or futile in light of Bank's rejection of the Bells' monthly payments\r\n  between February 2003 and August 2003. Â This conclusion was based upon his finding\r\n  that the due date for the second lump sum payment was August 2003. Â However,\r\n  because we find the second lump sum payment was due in November 2002, rather\r\n  than August 2003, Bank was under no obligation to accept any payments\r\n  made by the Bells short of the amount required to satisfy the debt. Â See Allendale Furniture Co., 284 S.C. at 79, 325 S.E.2d at 531; Dargan,\r\n  243 S.C. at 325, 133 S.E.2d at 823.Â  Moreover, we do not find credible the\r\n  Bells' assertion that the Bankâ€™s rejection of payments since February 2003\r\n  justified their failure to tender the lump sum payment in August 2003;\r\n  notwithstanding this position, the Bells continued making monthly payments\r\n  until October 2005.Â  Similarly, because the Bells missed the monthly payments\r\n  in December 2002 and January 2003, Bankâ€™s lawful rejection of any payments\r\n  subsequent to the default arising from these missed monthly payments may not be\r\n  asserted as a defense against Bank.Â  Accordingly, we find the useless or futile\r\n  act doctrine does not apply to the factual circumstances of this case, and we reverse\r\n  this determination.\r\nBank also\r\n  asserts the master-in-equity erred in ruling it was not entitled to collect\r\n  interest accrued on the loan.Â  We agree.Â  As previously indicated, the parties\r\n  agree the only term disputed regarding the reinstatement agreement was the date\r\n  the second lump sum payment was due.Â  Nowhere in the record or briefs have the\r\n  parties indicated the reinstatement agreement touched upon the issue of\r\n  interest. Â As such, the underlying Note controls the issue of interest.\r\nThe\r\n  construction of a clear and unambiguous contract presents\r\n  a question of law for the court. Â Ward\r\n  v. West Oil Co., 379 S.C. 225, 238, 665 S.E.2d 618, 625 (Ct. App. 2008); see\r\n  also Pruitt v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass'n,\r\n  343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).

Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373,\r\n  378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1988). Â &quot;A court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms regardless of its wisdom or\r\n  folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights\r\n  carefully.&quot;Â  S.C. Dept. of Transp. v. M &amp; T Enters. of Mt.\r\n  Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 655, 667 S.E.2d 7, 13&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the Note provides that interest will be charged at a yearly rate of nine\r\n  percent on unpaid principal until the full amount of the principal has been\r\n  paid.Â  Moreover, &quot;[t]he interest rate required by this Section 2 is the\r\n  rate [Mortgagor] will pay both before and after any default described in . . .\r\n  this Note.&quot;Â  Thus, under the plain and unambiguous terms of the Note, Bank\r\n  is entitled to interest accrued on the unpaid principal before and after the\r\n  Bells defaulted.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the order regarding interest and\r\n  remand to the master-in-equity for calculation of the Bells' debt to Bank consistent\r\n  with the terms of the Note.\r\nBank asserts the\r\n  master-in-equity erred in ruling Bank was not entitled to recover attorney's\r\n  fees incurred in attempting to collect the loan.Â  Because we find the Bells\r\n  were in default, we agree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  general rule is that attorney's fees\r\n  are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or\r\n  statute.&quot; Â Baron Data Sys., Inc. v.\r\n  Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297&nbsp;(1989) (citing Hegler\r\n  v.

Â &quot;Where there\r\n  is a contract, the award of attorney's fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will\r\n  not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown.&quot;Â  Id. (citations\r\n  omitted). Â Here, the contract between the parties provided\r\n  for reasonable attorney's fees and\r\n  costs in the event of default. Â Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  the master-in-equity's denial of attorney's fees to Bank and remand the issue to\r\n  the master-in-equity for reconsideration and an appropriate award of attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665,\r\n  666 (1993) (reversing and remanding issue of attorney's fees for\r\n  reconsideration when the substantive results achieved by trial counsel were\r\n  reversed on appeal). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe note\r\n  the increased filing of cases requesting foreclosure in this State.Â  Many\r\n  people have been affected by the economy and currently face the unfortunate\r\n  specter of foreclosure. Â While we acknowledge the hardship our decision may\r\n  create, we also recognize the court's limited role in giving effect to the\r\n  contractual agreement between the parties. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  based upon our analysis herein, we reverse and remand the case to the\r\n  master-in-equity for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] FORTRACS History Notes is a system banks use to\r\n  document the activity on an account, including payments, arrangements,\r\n  conversations, or any other activity on the account.Â  Activity supposedly is\r\n  documented at the time the work is completed.Â  Stokes testified only important\r\n  conversations and arrangements were recorded. \r\n[2] The asserted defenses included the following: (1)\r\n  failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; (2) waiver,\r\n  estoppel, laches and/or unclean hands; (3) statute of limitations; (4) accord\r\n  and satisfaction; (5) intervening acts by Bank; and (6) payment.\r\n[3] The Bells' June 2005 monthly payment was the lone\r\n  exception wherein Bank retained the funds.Â  \r\n[4] At trial, Mrs. Bell abandoned her interest in the\r\n  counterclaims asserted against Bank.Â  \r\n[5] Section 2 of the Note reads: \r\n\r\n  Interest\r\n    will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of the principal has\r\n    been paid.Â  [Mortgagor] will pay interest at a yearly rate of 9.000 [percent].Â \r\n    The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate [mortgagor] will pay\r\n    both before and after any default described in . . . this Note.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[6] While we do not necessarily agree that the\r\n  master-in-equity had the authority to restructure the missed payments over the\r\n  term of the loan, we need not reach this issue in light of our disposition\r\n  herein and because this issue is not properly preserved for our review.\r\n[7] We granted Bank's motion to supplement the Record on\r\n  Appeal to include the post trial memoranda and post trial hearing transcript.Â \r\n  We also note Bank never filed a Rule 59(e) motion.\r\n[8] As indicated in their respective briefs, both parties\r\n  agree that this case is governed by the equitable standard of review.\r\n[9] See, e.g., Franklin Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Nicholas,\r\n  812 A.2d 51, 57-58 (Conn. App. Ct. 2002) (&quot;In a mortgage foreclosure\r\n  action, to make out its prima facie case, the foreclosing party had to prove by\r\n  a preponderance of the evidence that it was the owner of the note and mortgage\r\n  and that the [defendant] had defaulted on the note.&quot;) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted) (internal citations omitted); Campaign v. Barba, 805 N.Y.S.2d\r\n  86, 86 (N.Y. App. Div. 2005) (&quot;To establish a prima facie case in an\r\n  action to foreclose a mortgage, the plaintiff must establish the existence of\r\n  the mortgage and mortgage note, ownership of the mortgage, and the defendant's\r\n  default in payment.&quot;); In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. for 143,600.00,\r\n  577 S.E.2d 398, 406 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003) (&quot;In a foreclosure proceeding,\r\n  the lender bears the burden of proving that there was a valid debt, default,\r\n  right to foreclose under power of sale, and notice.&quot;); 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages Â§ 604 (&quot;[T]he burden of proof of any particular issue rests upon the party\r\n  asserting the affirmative of that issue under the pleadings.&quot;); cf. Paramount Fund, Inc. v. Cusaac, 282 S.C. 497, 499, 319 S.E.2d 354, 355\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (holding the mortgagee has the burden of proving a disputed\r\n  mortgage by the preponderance of the evidence). \r\n[10] Although the Bells' Rule 59(e) motion challenged\r\n  whether Mr. Bell admitted to missing their December 2002 and January 2003\r\n  monthly payments, we note that the master-in-equity's supplemental order did\r\n  not address the Bells' missed monthly payments.Â  Instead, the supplemental\r\n  order explicitly stated that the first order remained in full force and effect\r\n  in all respects, except as specifically modified by the supplemental order.Â \r\n  Moreover, while we agree the record does not indicate an admission of this fact\r\n  by the Bells, the record nonetheless supports a finding that the payments were\r\n  missed based on the direct testimony of Stokes on this issue. \r\n[11] Even if our view of the preponderance of the evidence\r\n  as to the due date of the second lump sum payment in November 2002 is\r\n  incorrect, the missed December 2002 and January 2003 payments each\r\n  independently establish a default.Â  Once default occurs by virtue of these\r\n  missed monthly payments, the reinstatement agreement conflict as to the second lump\r\n  sum payment is no longer controlling as the balance owed on the note is\r\n  accelerated, and Bank is entitled to foreclose based on that default.\r\n[12] Bell testified Bank accepted one monthly payment for\r\n  June 2005, and further testified to &quot;know of two others that [were] cashed\r\n  and then a bank check was sent back&quot; to him; however, we note these acts\r\n  do not constitute a waiver of Bank's rights to acceleration and foreclosure.Â  See Caulder v. Lewis, 287 S.C. 372, 375, 338 S.E.2d 837, 839 (1986) (holding\r\n  one or two late payments accepted after default do not establish waiver, and\r\n  acceleration of the debt may still be exercised).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
