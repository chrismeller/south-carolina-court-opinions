Lincoln, Rhonda S. Lincoln,\r\nKarl D. Buckman, Joyce Buckman, Charles T. Hallman, Jr., David Freeman, and\r\nPatricia Freeman challenge a circuit court order that upheld a decision of the Town\r\nof Mount Pleasant Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) to allow Respondents South\r\nCarolina Electric and Gas Co./SCANA Communications, Inc. (respectively\r\nSCE&G and SCANA) to construct a telecommunications tower. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n937 Whipple Road is owned by SCE&G and leased to SCANA. It is located in the\r\nTown of Mount Pleasant (Town) and adjoins Candlewood, a residential\r\nsubdivision.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, property adjacent to the Candlewood subdivision was re-zoned from R-1\r\nto Economic Development (ED). In an ED zoning district, a telecommunications\r\ntower is allowed as a \"conditional use.\" Such a use comes with certain conditions\r\nthat must be met before the Town Zoning Administrator can approve it. Approval\r\nof conditional uses are staff level decisions and do not require notification.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, SCANA representatives began discussions with the planning staff\r\nof the Town of Mount Pleasant (Town) regarding the installation of a\r\ntelecommunications tower at 937 Whipple Road. Over the next few months, a\r\nseries of meetings and correspondence exchanges took place between SCANA and\r\nthe Town Zoning Administrator. Subsequently, SCANA applied for a conditional\r\nuse permit to construct a tower at the site and later supplemented its application\r\nwith additional information. By letter dated May 27, 2009, Kent Prause, the Town\r\nZoning Administrator, approved SCANA's application, but with a condition that a\r\n\"fall zone\" plan be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and approved\r\nbefore any required building permits were issued. Prause also stated in his letter\r\nthat the documents SCANA submitted with its application satisfied other required\r\nterms and conditions for telecommunications towers, including health, safety, and\r\naesthetic considerations, as well as attempts either to co-locate on existing towers\r\nor to build upon existing buildings and structures. In addition, SCANA, as\r\nrequired by the State Historic Preservation Office, published in the Post and\r\nCourier, a newspaper of general circulation where the tower was to be located, to\r\n\nsolicit comments from interested persons. No comments were received, and the\r\nState Historic Preservation Office approved the project.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Prause contacted property owners in Candlewood whose properties\r\nabutted the Whipple Road site, as well as to another Candlewood resident who had\r\nbeen involved in prior rezoning issues regarding the site. Prause advised these\r\nindividuals that a permit for a 195-foot tall telecommunications tower had been\r\napproved. In addition to noting the information was provided \"as a courtesy\r\nbecause of your proximity to the site,\" Prause advised the recipients of their right\r\nto contest the decision by appealing to the BZA. No one who received Prause's\r\ncommunication responded.1\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, SCANA filed the required \"fall zone\" certificate, which verified the\r\nwind load capacity of the tower and the radius of its fall in the event of a structural\r\nfailure. It bore the signature and seal of a professional engineer licensed in South\r\nCarolina. A building permit was then issued in October 2009, and construction of\r\nthe tower took place. Construction of the tower began on October 6, 2009, and\r\nwas completed on October 20, 2009.\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 2009, Appellants Alan C. and Rhonda S. Lincoln appealed\r\nPrause's authorization of the tower to the BZA. On the same day, Appellant Mark\r\nBevivino also filed an appeal of the decision. All three individuals live in the\r\nCandlewood subdivision. In their respective appeals, the Lincolns and Bevivino\r\nalleged that (1) the tower was a safety hazard and (2) it detracted from the\r\naesthetics and character of the neighborhood. On November 30, 2009, the BZA\r\nheld a full evidentiary hearing on the appeals filed by the Lincolns and Bevivino.\r\nAt the hearing, the remaining Appellants appeared and voiced their concerns;\r\nhowever, none of them were made parties to either of the appeals. By a 4-2 vote,\r\nthe BZA affirmed Prause's decision. The BZA issued written orders on January 4,\r\n2010.\r\n\r\nOn February 3, 2010, the Lincolns, Bevivino, and the remaining Appellants filed a\r\npetition for judicial review of the BZA orders. The Charleston County Court of\r\nCommon Pleas held a hearing in the matter on September 13, 2010. By written\r\norder dated October 22, 2010, and filed October 26, 2010, the Court of Common\r\nPleas affirmed the BZA decision. In the appealed order, the court found (1)\r\nAppellants failed to present evidence that the BZA decision was an error of law\r\n\r\n1 The record indicates that Karl D. Buckman and Joyce A. Buckman were the only\r\nrecipients of Prause's letter who are also parties to this appeal.\r\n\nregarding safety or aesthetic considerations, (2) Appellants were precluded from\r\nraising concerns about co-location, (3) the record had ample evidence to support all\r\npertinent considerations regarding the BZA's decision to allow the tower, (4)\r\nBevivino and the Lincolns had standing to pursue their appeal because of the close\r\nproximity of their homes to the tower site, (5) the remaining Appellants' attempt to\r\nappeal were barred by the doctrine of law of the case, and (6) none of the\r\nAppellants could maintain this action under the \"public importance\" exception to\r\nstanding. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\nI.     Do Appellants have standing to seek redress in the circuit court regarding\r\n       their opposition to the tower or, in the alternative, can they maintain this\r\n       action under the public interest exception to standing?\r\n\r\nII.    Did the BZA commit procedural and substantive errors in allowing SCANA\r\n       to construct the tower?\r\n\r\nIII.   Are the notice provisions of the applicable Town ordinances against public\r\n       policy?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"The findings of fact by the board of [zoning] appeals must be treated in the same\r\nmanner as a finding of fact by a jury, and the court may not take additional\r\nevidence.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2012). In determining the\r\nquestions on appeal, both the circuit court and the appellate court \"must determine\r\nonly whether the decision of the board is correct as a matter of law.\" Id. \"A court\r\nwill refrain from substituting its judgment for that of the reviewing body, even if it\r\ndisagrees with the decision.\" Clear Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 372\r\nS.C. 230, 234, 642 S.E.2d 565, 567 (2007). \"However, a decision of a city zoning\r\nboard will be overturned if it is arbitrary, capricious, has no reasonable relation to a\r\nlawful purpose, or if the board has abused its discretion.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.     Standing\r\n\r\nWe first address Respondents' argument that, except for Bevivino and the Lincolns,\r\nAppellants lack standing to pursue this appeal. The circuit court held that these\r\nAppellants (\"additional Appellants\") lacked standing to bring this action in the\r\n\ncircuit court because they did not appeal the staff decision approving the\r\nconditional use to the BZA. Reasoning that the additional Appellants failed to\r\navail themselves of their right to appeal to the BZA, as provided in section 6-29-\r\n800(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), the circuit court held they were\r\nbound by Prause's decision, and their attempts to appeal to the circuit court were\r\nbarred by the doctrine of the law of the case.2 Based on a decision issued by this\r\ncourt after the briefs in this case were filed, we hold the additional Appellants'\r\nfailure to join in the appeal to the BZA does not preclude them from participating\r\nin the judicial review proceedings in the circuit court or to maintain an appeal in\r\nthis court.\r\n\r\nIn Newton v. Zoning Board of Appeals for Beaufort County, 396 S.C. 112, 719\r\nS.E.2d 282 (Ct. App. 2011), the Newtons appealed the county zoning board's\r\nissuance of a special use permit to the circuit court, which affirmed the board's\r\ndecision, and then appealed to this court. As a threshold issue, the zoning board\r\ncontended the Newtons' arguments were unpreserved because they failed to raise\r\nthem to the board during the administrative process. Noting, however, that section\r\n6-29-820(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) allows any \"person who\r\nmay have a substantial interest in any decision\" by the zoning board to appeal the\r\ndecision to the circuit court and \"does not require an appellant to attend a public\r\nhearing on the Board's decision or even to communicate his concerns to the Board\r\nprior to filing his petition with the circuit court,\" this court held \"the sole\r\npreservation requirement for a first-level appeal of a zoning board's decision is that\r\nan appellant must set forth his issues on appeal in a written petition and file that\r\npetition with the circuit court before the thirty-day filing period expires.\" Id. at\r\n117, 719 S.E.2d at 284 (emphasis added). Here, there was no dispute that the\r\nadditional Appellants satisfied this requirement. Furthermore, section 6-29-820(A)\r\nallows an appeal to the circuit court by \"any person who may have a substantial\r\ninterest\" in a zoning board decision. (emphasis added). All Appellants, having\r\nsatisfied the prerequisites for statutory standing, were entitled to maintain this\r\n\r\n2 Under section 6-29-800(B), appeals to a local zoning board \"may be taken by\r\nany person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the\r\nmunicipality or county\" \"within a reasonable time, as provided by the zoning\r\nordinance or rules of the board, or both\" or, \"[i]f no time limit is provided, . . .\r\nwithin thirty days from the date the appealing party has received actual notice of\r\nthe action from which the appeal is taken.\" This version of the statute took effect\r\non June 2, 2003.\r\n\naction in the circuit court. See Freemantle v. Preston, 398 S.C. 186, 194, 728\r\nS.E.2d 40, 44 (2012) (\"The traditional concepts of constitutional standing are\r\ninapplicable when standing is conferred by statute.\").\r\n\r\nRespondents have also argued the additional Appellants lack constitutional\r\nstanding and cannot invoke the public importance exception to the standing\r\nrequirement. Because we hold that the additional Appellants had statutory\r\nstanding and did not have to appeal the Town's staff decision to the BZA to\r\nmaintain their appeal in the circuit court, it is unnecessary to address these\r\narguments. See id.; ATC S., Inc. v. Charleston Cnty., 380 S.C. 191, 195, 669\r\nS.E.2d 337, 339 (2008) (\"Standing may be acquired: (1) by statute; (2) through the\r\nrubric of 'constitutional standing;' or (3) under the 'public importance' exception.\")\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nII.   Review of the BZA Decision\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the BZA committed the following errors of law as to the lack\r\nof compliance with code requirements to have the tower approved:\r\n\r\n(1) although the applicable ordinance required a showing that \"the proposed\r\nstructure will not endanger the health and safety of residents,\" the only evidence\r\nthat this condition was satisfied was an engineer's letter stating only general\r\nexpectations about the performance of the structure and what was likely to happen\r\nin the event of a structural failure.\r\n\r\n(2) as to aesthetic considerations and concerns about the impact of the tower on\r\nneighborhood character and the use of neighboring properties, most of the visual\r\nevidence only showed the tower in relation to Whipple Road and did not depict the\r\ntower from the vantage point of Candlewood subdivision residents.\r\n\r\n(3) SCANA did not proffer any evidence regarding attempts to co-locate the tower\r\nwith an existing tower or to place it on an existing structure.\r\n\r\nWe hold these arguments fail.\r\n\r\nAs to the first issue, based on the standard of review for both the circuit court and\r\nthis court, we affirm the circuit court's finding that the BZA's decision was\r\nsupported by competent evidence that the tower would not endanger the health and\r\nsafety of nearby residents and other individuals. The manufacturer and an engineer\r\nlicensed in South Carolina stated that the tower would withstand a wind gust of\r\n130 miles per hour and was designed to fall on itself within a radius of seventy feet\r\n\nof its base in the event of a collapse. These statements were further supported by\r\nconstruction drawings. As further noted by the circuit court, the project underwent\r\nscrutiny from the Town building inspector, the Federal Aviation Administration,\r\nthe Federal Communications Commission, and the Office of Ocean and Coastal\r\nResource Management.\r\n\r\nAs to the aesthetic concerns, the tower is located in an area encompassing diverse\r\nproperty uses, including not only single-family residences such as those in\r\nCandlewood, but also utility and industrial uses, overhead electrical easements,\r\ninstitutional uses, lighted ball fields, and multi-family residential complexes.\r\nAppellants offered at best only speculative evidence that the tower would detract\r\nfrom their property values.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to Appellants' claim that SCANA failed to present evidence that it\r\nattempted to locate the tower either with other telecommunications facilities or on\r\nexisting structures, the record includes evidence that SCANA had considered sites\r\nwhere its tower would be co-located with other towers but later determined these\r\nother sites were not feasible because SCANA had specific needs that could not be\r\naccommodated by the transmission poles already in place, either because the poles\r\nwere not tall enough or because the coverage objectives of prospective tenants of\r\nthe tower would necessitate unacceptable interruptions in electrical service during\r\nthe installation process.\r\n\r\nIII.   Notice Provisions\r\n\r\nSCANA has presented an additional argument in its brief that the notice provisions\r\nin the applicable Town ordinances are against public policy because they render an\r\nunclear and ambiguous result that prevents orderly economic development.\r\nSpecifically, SCANA complains that Appellants were allowed to challenge the\r\ntower after SCANA had gone to great lengths to obtain approval for it from the\r\nTown based on their claim that they first received \"actual notice\" of the Town's\r\napproval of the tower when they saw the completed structure. Given our\r\ndisposition of the issues raised by Appellants, it is unnecessary for us to address\r\nthe question of whether the notice provisions in the zoning ordinances at issue here\r\nare against public policy. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not\r\naddress remaining issues when its disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold all Appellants had standing to pursue judicial review of the BZA's\r\ndecision and to appeal the circuit court's decision to this court. As to the merits of\r\nthe appeal, we hold Appellants have not shown that the BZA abused its discretion\r\nor that the BZA's decision to allow the tower was arbitrary, capricious, or without\r\nreasonable relation to a lawful purpose. We decline to address SCANA's\r\narguments that the notice provisions under which Appellants were allowed to\r\nchallenge the Town's decision are against public policy.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5081","title":"The Spriggs Group v.

(Spriggs) attorney's fees, costs, and interest. We affirm in part,\r\nreverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis case arises from a dispute between Slivka and Spriggs regarding Spriggs'\r\nprovision of architectural services for Slivka's home. Spriggs designed all of the\r\nbuildings on Slivka's Colleton County plantation (the property), including the main\r\nhouse, two detached garages with apartments, potting shed, conservatory, stable,\r\nand grotto. Pursuant to a November 17, 2006 written proposal (the Agreement),\r\nSpriggs was to receive a fixed fee of $161,500 for its architectural and engineering\r\ndesign services, and hourly fees for any additional services. The fixed fee was\r\nsubsequently reduced to $152,402. Slivka paid half of the fee at the start of the\r\ndesign process and agreed to pay the remainder upon completion of the project.\r\n\r\nAccording to Slivka, he terminated Spriggs on December 12, 2008. Slivka\r\ncontends he picked up the remaining drawings from Spriggs' office and told\r\nSpriggs he did not want any more drawings. Spriggs, however, continued to\r\nperform its services under the Agreement. According to Ken Spriggs, principal of\r\nSpriggs, he was unaware Slivka had allegedly terminated Spriggs. In February\r\n2009, Spriggs submitted four invoices totaling $198,834.53 to Slivka for payment\r\nin accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Slivka admitted he owed Spriggs\r\n$76,201, the balance of the Agreement price, but disputed the additional charges\r\nand refused to pay Spriggs. Spriggs provided services to Slivka pursuant to the\r\nAgreement through May 2009.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Slivka's failure to pay Spriggs in accordance with the terms of the\r\nAgreement, Spriggs filed a mechanic's lien against the property on April 13, 2009.\r\nSlivka continued to refuse to pay Spriggs and posted a $265,112.71 cash bond to\r\nremove the lien from the property. Thereafter, on July 8, 2009, Spriggs\r\ncommenced a foreclosure action on the lien. In an amended complaint filed in\r\nMay 2010, Spriggs asserted claims for foreclosure of mechanic's lien, breach of\r\ncontract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, quantum meruit, and\r\nfailure to comply with section 27-1-15 of the South Carolina Code (2007). Slivka\r\ncounterclaimed for slander of title, violation of the Frivolous Claims Sanctions\r\nAct, tortious interference with contractual relationships with third parties\r\ndependent upon performance by Spriggs, and tortious interference with contractual\r\nrelationships with third parties resulting from defective notice of mechanic's lien.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 2011, Slivka offered to settle the case for $100,000, but Spriggs did\r\nnot accept the offer. Prior to trial, Spriggs filed a motion to strike Slivka's\r\naffirmative defenses and counterclaims. Thereafter, Slivka filed a motion for\r\nsummary judgment as to all of Spriggs' causes of action. Spriggs countered with\r\n\r\n \r\n\nits own motion for summary judgment. At the motions hearing, Slivka agreed to\r\nwithdraw certain counterclaims, and the circuit court denied both motions for\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\nThe parties proceeded to trial on all of Spriggs' causes of action and on Slivka's\r\ncounterclaims for slander of title, tortious interference with contractual\r\nrelationships with third parties dependent upon performance by Spriggs, and\r\ntortious interference with contractual relationships with third parties resulting from\r\ndefective notice of mechanic's lien. At trial, Spriggs asserted the additional\r\ncharges in its invoices were a result of Slivka's demands and changes, and they\r\nwere billed pursuant to the Agreement. Slivka maintained the additional charges\r\nwere not contemplated when the Agreement was made and Spriggs had a duty to\r\nadvise him before performing and charging for additional work.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Spriggs' case, the circuit court denied Slivka's directed verdict\r\nmotions as to Spriggs' causes of action for foreclosure of mechanic's lien, breach of\r\ncontract, and failure to comply with section 27-1-15. The circuit court also denied\r\nSpriggs' motion for a directed verdict as to the section 27-1-15 claim. Spriggs\r\nwithdrew its claims for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act and\r\nquantum meruit. Following Slivka's case, the circuit court denied Spriggs' motion\r\nfor a directed verdict as to Slivka's slander of title claim. Slivka also renewed his\r\ndirected verdict motions as to Spriggs' causes of action for foreclosure of\r\nmechanic's lien and failure to comply with section 27-1-15. The circuit court ruled\r\nboth causes of action would be submitted to the jury.\r\n\r\nSpriggs' foreclosure of mechanic's lien, breach of contract, and failure to comply\r\nwith section 27-1-15 claims were submitted to the jury, along with Slivka's slander\r\nof title claim.1 Following deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nSpriggs on all three of its causes of action and on Slivka's slander of title cause of\r\naction. The jury awarded Spriggs $173,990.53 in actual damages. Slivka made a\r\npost-trial motion seeking a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and/or a\r\nnew trial on Spriggs' foreclosure of mechanic's lien and failure to comply with\r\nsection 27-1-15 claims.2 The circuit court denied Slivka's JNOV motion and his\r\nsubsequent Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend. Spriggs made a post-\r\ntrial motion seeking attorney's fees, costs, and interest. The circuit court granted\r\nthe motion and awarded Spriggs $235,030.31 in attorney's fees and costs and\r\n                                                            \r\n1 Slivka withdrew both of his tortious interference with contractual relationships \n\r\nclaims. \n\r\n2 Slivka did not appeal the jury's verdict on Spriggs' breach of contract claim. \n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n$37,413.92 in prejudgment interest. Thereafter, the circuit court denied Slivka's\r\nRule 59(e) motion to alter or amend. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Statutory Interpretation\r\n\r\nSlivka argues the circuit court erred in submitting the question of whether the\r\nservices provided by Spriggs in January 2009 fell within the definition of \"labor\"\r\ncontained in section 29-5-10(a) of the South Carolina Code (2007) to the jury. We\r\nagree but find no reversible error.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 29-5-90 of the South Carolina Code (2007), a mechanic's lien\r\n\r\n             shall be dissolved unless the person desiring to avail\r\n             himself thereof, within ninety days after he ceases to\r\n             labor on or furnish labor or materials for such building or\r\n             structure, serves upon the owner . . . a statement of a just\r\n             and true account of the amount due him, with all just\r\n             credits given, together with a description of the property\r\n             intended to be covered by the lien. . . .\r\n\r\nSection 29-5-10(a) states:\r\n\r\n             [L]abor performed or furnished in the erection, alteration,\r\n             or repair of any building or structure upon any real estate\r\n             includes the preparation of plans, specifications, and\r\n             design drawings and the work of making the real estate\r\n             suitable as a site for the building or structure. The work is\r\n             considered to include, but not be limited to, the grading,\r\n             bulldozing, leveling, excavating, and filling of land\r\n             (including the furnishing of fill soil), the grading and\r\n             paving of curbs and sidewalks and all asphalt paving, the\r\n             construction of ditches and other drainage facilities, and\r\n             the laying of pipes and conduits for water, gas, electric,\r\n             sewage, and drainage purposes, and the disposal of any\r\n             construction and demolition debris, as defined in Section\r\n             44-96-40(6), including final disposal by a construction\r\n             and demolition landfill. Any private security guard\r\n             services provided by any person at the site of the building\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             or structure during its erection, alteration, or repair is\r\n             considered to be labor performed or furnished within the\r\n             meaning of this section. . . .\r\n\r\nFor its lien to be timely, Spriggs must have performed labor, within the definition\r\ncontained in section 29-5-10(a), on or after January 13, 2009. According to Andy\r\nBozeman, a Spriggs employee, Spriggs addressed a plumbing subcontractor's\r\nrequest to substitute the size of plumbing lines used on the project on January 13,\r\n2009. Bozeman also communicated with a mechanical engineer and answered\r\nquestions regarding the plumbing line substitution.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Slivka argued that while the timeliness of the lien was a question of fact\r\nfor the jury to decide, whether the construction administration services performed\r\nby Spriggs on January 13, 2009, fell within the statutory definition of labor was a\r\nquestion of statutory interpretation for the court. In response, Spriggs argued the\r\nquestion before the jury was one of timeliness, and the services it provided on\r\nJanuary 13, 2009, were clearly within the definition of labor. The circuit court\r\ndecided,     as to the mechanic's lien itself, I'm just going to submit it\r\n             to the jury. I'm going to read them the statute. I'm going\r\n             to give them the charge . . . . It's kind of long and\r\n             redundant but y'all can argue whether that is service that\r\n             falls within the mechanic's lien statute. And of course\r\n             you can argue the timeliness and all of that kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nSlivka contends the question of whether Spriggs' work fell within the purview of\r\nthe mechanic's lien statute was erroneously submitted to the jury. Spriggs\r\nmaintains the jury was properly instructed to determine whether its lien was valid\r\nand timely. Spriggs also notes the circuit court ruled post-trial it was \"implausible\r\nthat construction administration services would be excluded from the description\r\nof labor performed or furnished in the erection, alteration, or repair of any\r\nbuilding.\"\r\n\r\nWe find the circuit court erred in submitting the question of whether Spriggs' work\r\nfell within the purview of the mechanic's lien statute to the jury. See Catawba\r\nIndian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007)\r\n(holding the issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court).\r\nHowever, this error was harmless because, as discussed below, we find the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nconstruction administration services proved by Spriggs fell within the definition of\r\nlabor contained in 29-5-10(a).\r\n\r\nII.   Timeliness of the Lien\r\n\r\nSlivka argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict\r\nbecause Spriggs' lien was not timely. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, this Court\r\nmust employ the same standard as the [circuit] court by viewing the evidence and\r\nall reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\r\nWelch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The\r\n[circuit] court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one\r\ninference or its inference is in doubt.\" Id. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at 418. \"This Court\r\nwill reverse the [circuit] court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling\r\nbelow.\" Id. \"When considering directed verdict and JNOV motions, neither the\r\n[circuit] court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to\r\nresolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.\" Id. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at 419.\r\n\r\nFirst, Slivka contends the work performed by Spriggs on January 13, 2009, does\r\nnot fall within the definition of labor contained in section 29-5-10(a) because none\r\nof Spriggs' work involved \"the preparation of plans, specifications, and design\r\ndrawings.\" Slivka maintains none of the work performed by Bozeman occurred on\r\nsite, and the work only amounted to construction administration services. Slivka\r\nargues the circuit court erred in relying on Williamson v. Hotel Melrose, 110 S.C.\r\n1, 96 S.E. 407 (1918), in finding construction administration services are a type of\r\nlabor for which a mechanic's lien may be filed under the mechanic's lien statute. In\r\nWilliamson, our supreme court determined an architect who furnished plans and\r\nspecifications and \"superintended\" the construction of a project had performed\r\nlabor within the meaning of the mechanic's lien statute. 110 S.C. at 1, 96 S.E. at\r\n411. At the time, the mechanic's lien statute did not include the definition of labor\r\ncontained in the current statute. The statute at the time afforded a lien to \"any\r\nperson to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished.\" Id.\r\n\r\nSlivka maintains Williamson is not applicable because the current version of the\r\nmechanic's lien statute, section 29-5-10(a), contains specific activities determined\r\nby the legislature to be \"labor\" and does not include construction administration\r\nservices. Slivka argues the legislature could have included off-site construction\r\nadministration services of a design professional in its definition of labor but it\r\nchose not to. Furthermore, Slivka maintains Spriggs was not on-site directing the\r\n\r\n \r\n\nwork on the property like the architect in Williamson. Ken Spriggs testified he was\r\nnot directing any work or supervising the construction.\r\n\r\nWe find the construction administration services provided by Spriggs are labor\r\npursuant to the definition of labor in section 29-5-10(a). While the statute provides\r\nlabor \"includes the preparation of plans, specifications, and design drawings,\" it\r\nalso states labor includes \"the work of making the real estate suitable as a site for\r\nthe building or structure.\" Here, Spriggs' discussions with the plumber and\r\nengineer in January 2009 were part of its architectural services overseeing the\r\nproper construction of the property.\r\n\r\nSlivka also contends the circuit court erred in finding work performed by Spriggs\r\nin May 2009 supported the timeliness of the lien filed on April 13, 2009. At trial,\r\nBozeman testified he provided design sketches for an appraisal of the property in\r\nMay 2009. Slivka argues this work could not support the timeliness of Spriggs'\r\nlien because it was allegedly performed after the lien was filed. We find the circuit\r\ncourt did not err because the court's order does not explicitly say, as alleged by\r\nSlivka, that the May 2009 services were performed within ninety days of April 13,\r\n2009. While the circuit court order mentions the May 2009 services, it notes these\r\nservices were performed after the lien was filed. The court also specifically notes\r\nthe lien was filed within ninety days of January 13, 2009. Accordingly, we affirm\r\nthe circuit court's denial of Slivka's motion for a directed verdict on Spriggs'\r\nmechanic's lien claim.\r\n\r\nIII.   Attorney's Fees, Costs, and Interest\r\n\r\n\"A party cannot recover attorney's fees unless authorized by contract or statute.\"\r\nCullen v. McNeal, 390 S.C. 470, 491, 702 S.E.2d 378, 389 (Ct. App. 2010). Here,\r\nsections 27-1-5 and 29-5-10 of the South Carolina Code (2007) both authorize an\r\naward of attorney's fees to Spriggs. Pursuant to section 27-1-15,\r\n\r\n             [w]henever a contractor, laborer, design professional, or\r\n             materials supplier has expended labor, services, or\r\n             materials under contract for the improvement of real\r\n             property, and where due and just demand has been made\r\n             by certified or registered mail for payment for the labor,\r\n             services, or materials under the terms of any regulation,\r\n             undertaking, or statute, it is the duty of the person upon\r\n             whom the claim is made to make a reasonable and fair\r\n             investigation of the merits of the claim and to pay it, or\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             whatever portion of it is determined as valid, within\r\n             forty-five days from the date of mailing the demand. If\r\n             the person fails to make a fair investigation or otherwise\r\n             unreasonably refuses to pay the claim or proper portion,\r\n             he is liable for reasonable attorney's fees and interest at\r\n             the judgment rate from the date of the demand.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, pursuant to section 29-5-10(a), \"[t]he costs which may arise in\r\nenforcing or defending against the lien. . . , including a reasonable attorney's fee,\r\nmay be recovered by the prevailing party.\" \"The fee must be determined by the\r\ncourt in which the action is brought but the fee and court costs may not exceed the\r\namount of the lien.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe following six factors should be considered when determining reasonable\r\nattorney's fees: \"(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time\r\nnecessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\ncontingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary\r\nlegal fees for similar services.\" Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d\r\n750, 760 (1997). \"The decision to award or deny attorneys' fees under a state\r\nstatute will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\" Kiriakides v.\r\nSch. Dist. of Greenville Cnty., 382 S.C. 8, 20, 675 S.E.2d 439, 445 (2009). \"An\r\nabuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the [circuit] court are either\r\ncontrolled by an error of law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions.\" Id.\r\n\"Similarly, the specific amount of attorneys' fees awarded pursuant to a statute\r\nauthorizing reasonable attorneys' fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and\r\nwill not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\" Id.\r\n\r\nA.    Section 27-1-15\r\n\r\nSlivka argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on\r\nSpriggs' failure to comply with the section 27-1-15 claim. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSlivka contends Spriggs failed to present any evidence Slivka did not perform a\r\nfair and reasonable investigation because at the time Spriggs made its demand\r\nunder the statute the parties were involved in litigation initiated by Spriggs. We\r\nfind whether a fair and reasonable investigation of Spriggs' claim has been made\r\nand whether a valid portion of the claim was paid in a timely manner are questions\r\nof fact for the jury. See Hardaway Concrete Co., Inc. v. Hall Contracting Corp.,\r\n374 S.C. 216, 229, 647 S.E.2d 488, 495 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding whether a party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nmade a fair and reasonable investigation of the merits of a claim is a question of\r\nfact).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Slivka argues at the time the demand was made it was impossible to\r\ndetermine the \"valid\" amount due because of the parties' pending claims against\r\neach other for damages. Finally, Slivka maintains his failure to make a payment at\r\nthe time of the demand was not unreasonable because he had already paid the court\r\na cash bond exceeding the amount of Spriggs' claim. Slivka fails to cite any legal\r\nprecedent to support these arguments. Accordingly, we find these arguments are\r\nabandoned on appeal. See Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 599,\r\n635 S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting when an appellant fails to cite any\r\nsupporting authority for his position and makes conclusory arguments, the\r\nappellant abandons the issue on appeal).\r\n\r\nB.    Amount of Attorney's Fees and Costs\r\n\r\nSlivka argues the circuit court erred in awarding Spriggs $235,030.31 in attorney's\r\nfees and costs. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court determined Spriggs was entitled to $235,030.31 in attorney's fees\r\nand costs pursuant to sections 29-5-10 and 27-1-15. The court further found the\r\nfees and costs awarded were reasonable based upon the six criteria established by\r\nthe supreme court. The circuit court noted, \"[Spriggs] was required to expend\r\nconsiderably more time and effort on this case due to specific actions of [Slivka]\r\nwho created unnecessary delays, filed meritless motions, and forced [Spriggs] to\r\nincur additional attorney's fees and costs above and beyond what would otherwise\r\nhave been incurred.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, Slivka argues Spriggs was not entitled to recover $28,619.25 in staff member\r\nfees as part of its attorney's fees award. We find the circuit court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in including staff member fees in its award of attorney's fees. We note\r\nSlivka fails to cite any legal precedent to support this argument. Additionally, this\r\ncourt has upheld attorney's fees awards which included paralegal fees. See\r\nMcElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 602, 506 S.E.2d 1, 11 (Ct. App. 1998);\r\nCharleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 484, 458 S.E.2d\r\n431, 439 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\n\r\nNext, Slivka contends Spriggs' total recovery is limited to the amount of the cash\r\nbond he posted with the clerk of court. Slivka argues that pursuant to section 29-5-\r\n110 of the South Carolina Code (2007), the total payment to Spriggs is limited to\r\n\r\n \r\n\n$266,012.71, the amount of the cash bond he paid to the clerk of court. Therefore,\r\nSlivka maintains because Spriggs' verdict was $173,990.53, any award of\r\nattorney's fees under the mechanic's lien statute is limited to a maximum of\r\n$92,022.18. We disagree. Section 29-5-110 relates to the amount of the judgment\r\nand makes no mention of attorney's fees. Attorney's fees are specifically addressed\r\nin section 29-5-10, which provides that the costs and fees incurred in enforcing or\r\ndefending against the lien may be recoverable by the prevailing party up to the\r\namount of the lien. See § 29-5-10(a).\r\n\r\nFinally, Slivka argues the attorney's fees awarded by the circuit court are not\r\nreasonable and the circuit court order fails to specify which fees were awarded\r\npursuant to which statute. Although the amount of attorney's fees awarded in this\r\ncase, compared to the jury award, may not shock the conscience of this court, the\r\nneedle is definitely moving on the seismograph. The circuit court order is unclear\r\nas to which fees were awarded under which statutory authority. We note the\r\ncourt's award exceeds the amount permitted under the mechanic's lien statute.\r\nFurther, although theoretically possible, it is improbable an attorney's fee of almost\r\n$250,000 would be awarded for a net recovery of approximately $75,000 above the\r\n$100,000 settlement offered by Slivka under section 27-1-15. The circuit court\r\nmay have combined the two statutes to reach the figure, although the legality of\r\nthat procedure is not addressed in this decision. Moreover, the trial court surely\r\ndid not award fees for the two causes of action it dismissed or for the breach of\r\ncontract claim. Thus, because we find the circuit court's order is unclear, we\r\nreverse the court's award of $235,030.31 in attorney's fees to Spriggs and remand\r\nthe issue of attorney's fees to the circuit court for reconsideration. We order the\r\ncircuit court to clearly identify the statutory authority for its award and the fees\r\nincurred under each statute.\r\n\r\nC.    Prejudgment Interest\r\n\r\nSlivka argues the circuit court's award of $37,413.92 in prejudgment interest to\r\nSpriggs was not supported by statute. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe law permits the award of prejudgment interest when a monetary obligation is a\r\nsum certain, or is capable of being reduced to certainty, accruing from the time\r\npayment may be demanded either by the agreement of the parties or the operation\r\nof law. Butler Contr., Inc. v. Court St., LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 133, 631 S.E.2d 252,\r\n258 (2006). Generally, prejudgment interest may not be recovered on an\r\nunliquidated claim in the absence of agreement or statute. Id. The fact that the\r\namount due is disputed does not render the claim unliquidated for purposes of\r\n\r\n \r\n\nawarding prejudgment interest. Id. Rather, the proper test is \"whether or not the\r\nmeasure of recovery, not necessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions\r\nexisting at the time the claim arose.\" Id. \"The award of prejudgment interest will\r\nnot be disturbed on appeal unless the [circuit] court committed an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\" Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 435, 673\r\nS.E.2d 448, 457-58 (2009).\r\n\r\nWe find the circuit court did not err in awarding Spriggs prejudgment interest. We\r\nnote the court's award of prejudgment interest was not limited to Spriggs' cause of\r\naction for failure to comply with section 27-1-15. The court also awarded interest\r\non Spriggs' breach of contract claim, which was not appealed and is the law of the\r\ncase. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's award of prejudgment interest.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the construction administration services provided by Spriggs fell within\r\nthe definition of labor contained in section 29-5-10(a). Additionally, we affirm the\r\ncircuit court's award of prejudgment interest and denial of Slivka's directed verdict\r\nmotions as to Spriggs' section 27-1-15 and mechanic's lien claims. We reverse the\r\ncircuit court's award of attorney's fees and remand for reconsideration.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5083","title":"Cohen v.

The trial court refused to reform\r\n\nthe policy, finding Progressive made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage. We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Greg Cohen called Citizens Insurance Agency to purchase a policy for his\r\nmotorcycle. He remembers speaking with a female employee about the policy but\r\ndoes not recall her name. Meredith Thomason, a Citizens Insurance agent, does\r\nnot specifically recall speaking with Cohen but testified she wrote the quote sheet\r\ngenerated as a result of that call. She also signed the application form for Cohen's\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThomason does not remember the transaction with Cohen. Therefore, her account\r\nof how Cohen applied for the policy is based on the procedure she typically\r\nfollows for completing an application. She testified that a transaction begins with\r\na phone call, and she fills out a quote sheet while talking with the client. She then\r\ncreates an application form using input from the client, and prints it only after she\r\nand the client have discussed and agreed upon what types and limits of coverage he\r\nwants. When the client comes to Citizens Insurance's office to complete the\r\napplication, Thomason gives him an opportunity to read it. Going through each\r\npage of the application, she explains UIM coverage, tells the client he is not\r\nrequired by law to have it, and recommends the client buy UIM coverage with\r\nlimits equal to the other types of coverage he is purchasing. She also reviews\r\nwhich coverage the client is selecting and which he is rejecting in the application\r\nform. The client signs the application in several places, including an\r\nacknowledgment stating he has read the information that Thomason presented to\r\nhim regarding UIM coverage. Thomason then signs on a line indicating that the\r\nclient has completed and signed the application. After that, she gives the client a\r\ncopy. Thomason testified she never deviates from this procedure.\r\n\r\nCohen's recollection of applying for his policy differs from Thomason's procedure.\r\nHe testified that when he called Citizens Insurance, he told the agent, \"I want the\r\nsame coverage that I have on my Expedition, my other vehicle.\" He does not recall\r\ntalking on the phone about UIM coverage. The next day, he went to Citizens\r\nInsurance's office and spent less than five minutes signing paperwork. The\r\nemployee with whom he met did not explain what was in the paperwork, and\r\nCohen did not review the documents before signing them. They did not discuss\r\nwhat coverage limits he wanted or what would happen if he did not buy UIM\r\n\ncoverage and was later injured. He testified he did not tell the employee that he\r\ndid not want UIM coverage.\r\n\r\nThe application Cohen and Thomason signed includes an explanation of what UIM\r\ncoverage is and how it works. Additionally, using language nearly identical to that\r\nendorsed by the supreme court in Bower v. National General Insurance Co., 351\r\nS.C. 112, 119-20, 569 S.E.2d 313, 317 (2002), the application explains that UIM\r\ncoverage is optional and that it can be purchased up to the limits of the liability\r\ncoverage Cohen was purchasing. Another page, entitled \"Offer of underinsured\r\nmotorist coverage,\" has a table listing four levels of UIM coverage limits and the\r\nincreased premium Cohen would have to pay for each level. The highest of the\r\nfour levels is equal to the limits of the liability and uninsured motorist coverage\r\nCohen requested in the application form. Below that table, the application asks,\r\n\"Do you wish to purchase underinsured motorist coverage?\" and provides blanks\r\nnext to the words \"Yes\" and \"No.\" A computer-generated \"X\" appears in the blank\r\nnext to \"No.\" Thomason selected that \"X\" when she generated the form on her\r\ncomputer. The next line of the application states, \"If your answer is 'no' then you\r\nmust sign here,\" and then provides a signature line. Cohen signed on that line.\r\nBelow Cohen's signature, the application states, \"If your answer is 'yes,' then\r\nspecify the limits which you desire. These limits cannot exceed your motor\r\nvehicle insurance liability limits.\" The word \"REJECTED\" is typed below that\r\ninstruction. Based on this application form, Progressive issued Cohen a policy that\r\ndoes not provide UIM coverage.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Cohen was injured while riding his motorcycle. The Cohens filed this\r\ndeclaratory judgment action against Progressive and Auto-Owners Insurance\r\nCompany. They asked that Progressive's policy be reformed to provide UIM\r\ncoverage in the amount of the limits of the policy's liability coverage.1\r\n\r\nSitting nonjury, the trial court heard testimony from Cohen and Thomason and\r\nreviewed the application form. The court found Progressive made a meaningful\r\noffer of UIM coverage and Cohen rejected the offer. The Cohens filed a motion to\r\nreconsider, which the court denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Auto-Owners issued a policy for the Expedition. The parties stipulated that if the\r\ncourt reformed Progressive's policy to provide UIM coverage, then Auto-Owners'\r\npolicy would also provide UIM coverage.\r\n\n      II.\t   Whether the Trial Court Erred in Finding Progressive Made a\r\n             Meaningful Offer of UIM Coverage\r\n\r\nAutomobile insurers are required to \"offer . . . underinsured motorist coverage up\r\nto the limits of the insured's liability coverage.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-160\r\n(2002). Our supreme court has interpreted this language to require that \"the\r\ninsured . . . be provided with adequate information . . . to allow the insured to make\r\nan intelligent decision of whether to accept or reject the coverage.\" State Farm\r\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556\r\n(1987). In other words, \"the insurer's offer of UIM coverage must be\r\n'meaningful.'\" Atkins v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 376 S.C. 625, 630, 658 S.E.2d 106,\r\n109 (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Tucker v. Allstate Ins. Co., 337 S.C. 128, 130, 522\r\nS.E.2d 819, 820-21 (Ct. App. 1999), which relied on Wannamaker, 291 S.C. at\r\n521-22, 354 S.E.2d at 556-57). The Wannamaker court adopted a standard for\r\n\"determin[ing] whether an insurer has complied with its duty to offer [UIM\r\ncoverage].\" 291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556. The Wannamaker test requires the\r\nfollowing:   In general, for an insurer to make a meaningful offer of\r\n             UIM coverage, (1) the insurer's notification process must\r\n             be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing;\r\n             (2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional\r\n             coverage and not merely offer additional coverage in\r\n             general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the\r\n             insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the\r\n             insured must be told that optional coverages are available\r\n             for an additional premium.\r\n\r\nProgressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 349, 608 S.E.2d 569, 571\r\n(2005) (citing Wannamaker, 291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556).\r\n\r\n\"If the insurer fails to comply with its statutory duty to make a meaningful offer to\r\nthe insured, the policy will be reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM\r\ncoverage up to the limits of liability insurance carried by the insured.\" Floyd v.\r\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 261, 626 S.E.2d 6, 11 (2005) (citation and\r\nquotation marks omitted). \"The insurer bears the burden of establishing that it\r\nmade a meaningful offer.\" Atkins, 376 S.C. at 630, 658 S.E.2d at 109.\r\n\nThe question of whether an insurer met its burden of proving it made a meaningful\r\noffer of UIM coverage is a question of fact. See Floyd, 367 S.C. at 264, 626\r\nS.E.2d at 12 (stating \"[s]uch a case presents a factual issue\"). The trial court found\r\nProgressive met its burden of proving its offer satisfied each prong of the\r\nWannamaker test and, therefore, that it complied with section 38-77-160. On\r\nappeal, our role is limited to determining whether evidence in the record\r\nreasonably supports the trial court's findings. See Atkins, 376 S.C. at 630, 658\r\nS.E.2d at 109 (stating in a declaratory judgment action to determine whether an\r\ninsurer made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, \"the trial judge's factual\r\nfindings will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review of the record reveals there\r\nis no evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings\").\r\n\r\nThe trial court based its factual finding that Progressive made a meaningful offer of\r\nUIM in compliance with section 38-77-160 on the basis of (1) Thomason's\r\nexplanation of the coverage in her conversations with Cohen on the phone and in\r\nperson, (2) the contents of the application form Progressive used to make the offer,\r\nand (3) the fact that Cohen signed the application's acknowledgment stating he\r\nread the explanation of UIM coverage. The court stated \"the totality of the\r\ntransaction with . . . Thomason shows that Cohen was given a meaningful offer.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Thomason's personal explanation of UIM coverage, the court found she \"not\r\nonly orally presented the offer but also provided him with the written offer form,\"\r\nshe \"specified the limits of optional coverage up to Cohen's liability limits,\" she\r\n\"intelligibly advised him of the nature of the optional coverages,\" and she \"told\r\nhim that the optional coverages were available for an additional premium.\" These\r\nfindings were based on the trial court's credibility determination that Thomason\r\nfollowed \"her general procedure,\" which she spelled out in great detail. The court\r\nfound \"Thomason's testimony shows that the Wannamaker requirements for a\r\nmeaningful offer were met.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court also based its factual findings on the contents of the form\r\nProgressive used to make the offer. The court specifically found \"the offer form\r\nfully satisfied the five requirements of § 38-77-350(A)\" and \"it also satisfied the\r\nfour-element Wannamaker test.\" We agree with the trial court that the form, which\r\nwas prescribed by the South Carolina Department of Insurance and includes\r\nlanguage nearly identical to that endorsed by the supreme court in Bower,\r\ncontained all of the information required under subsection 38-77-350(A) and\r\nWannamaker. Based on Thomason's personal explanation and on the content of\r\nthe form, the court found \"the notification process [was] commercially reasonable.\"\r\n\nFinally, the trial court found that by signing the form, Cohen was deemed to\r\nunderstand its contents. Cohen signed the form in three places, including a page in\r\nwhich he acknowledged that he either read, or had someone read to him, the form's\r\nexplanation of UIM coverage and its offer of that coverage. See Floyd, 367 S.C. at\r\n263, 626 S.E.2d at 12 (stating \"a competent person usually is presumed to have\r\nknowledge and understanding of a document he signs, absent evidence his\r\nsignature was obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, or duress\").\r\n\r\nWe find the evidence described above reasonably supports the trial court's finding\r\nthat Progressive proved it met the Wannamaker test and therefore made a\r\nmeaningful offer in compliance with section 38-77-160.\r\n\r\n   III.\t The Significance of the Form Not Being \"Properly Completed\" \n\r\n         under Subsection 38-77-350(B) \n\r\n\r\nSubsection 38-77-350(B) of the South Carolina Code (2002) provides that if the\r\napplication form required by subsection 38-77-350(A) is \"properly completed and\r\nexecuted by the named insured it is conclusively presumed that [the offer complied\r\nwith section 38-77-160].\" Progressive concedes the form was not \"properly\r\ncompleted\" because Cohen did not personally make all the required marks on it\r\nand, therefore, Progressive does not get the presumption. See Floyd, 367 S.C. at\r\n262, 626 S.E.2d at 11 (\"An insurer enjoys a presumption it made a meaningful\r\noffer when a form is executed in compliance with [section 38-77-350]. The insurer\r\nmay not benefit from the [presumption] when the form does not comply with the\r\nstatute.\" (citations omitted)). Thus, there is no reason to further consider the terms\r\nor requirements of subsection 38-77-350(B).\r\n\r\nThe Cohens argue, however, that because the form was not \"properly completed\"\r\nin compliance with subsection 38-77-350(B), it is not a meaningful offer under\r\nsection 38-77-160 and Wannamaker. The argument is based on a\r\nmisunderstanding of a statement the supreme court made in Hanover Insurance\r\nCo. v. Horace Mann Insurance Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57, 389 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1990),\r\nand repeated in other cases including Floyd, 367 S.C. at 261, 626 S.E.2d at 11—\"a\r\nnoncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer at all.\" The Cohens' argument\r\nconfuses the requirement that the subsection 38-77-350(A) form be \"properly\r\ncompleted\" to get the subsection 38-77-350(B) presumption with the requirement\r\nthat an offer must be \"meaningful\" to comply with section 38-77-160. In essence,\r\n\nthe Cohens argue that an offer form must be \"properly completed\" under\r\nsubsection 38-77-350(B) or it is \"no offer at all.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Hanover, the insurer's compliance with section 38-77-350 was not an issue.2\r\nRather, the supreme court addressed only the requirement of a meaningful offer\r\nunder section 38-77-160. In Floyd, the court made the statement in its general\r\ndiscussion of the requirement of a meaningful offer to comply with section 38-77-\r\n160.3 In both cases, therefore, the court used the phrase \"noncomplying offer\" to\r\nrefer to the requirement of a meaningful offer and compliance with section 38-77-\r\n160. The court was not referring in either Hanover or Floyd, or in any of the other\r\nopinions in which it has used the phrase,4 to the subsection 38-77-350(B)\r\nrequirement of \"properly completing\" the subsection 38-77-350(A) form. The\r\nsupreme court has recently recognized, at least implicitly, that noncompliance with\r\nsubsection 38-77-350(B) does not mean there was no meaningful offer:\r\n\r\n             It is important to note \"[f]ailure to comply with section\r\n             38-77-350(A) does not automatically require judicial\r\n             reformation of a policy. Rather, even where an insurer is\r\n             not entitled to the presumption [in section 37-77-350(B)]\r\n             that it made a meaningful offer, it may prove the\r\n             sufficiency of its offer by showing that it complied with\r\n             Wannamaker.\"\r\n\r\n2In fact, subsection 38-77-350(B) did not apply in Hanover because the effective\r\ndate of the subsection occurred after the events that gave rise to the lawsuit.\r\nCompare 1989 S.C. Acts 513 (stating section 38-77-350 \"takes effect July 1,\r\n1989\") and 1989 S.C. Acts 461 (stating the \"form must be used by insurers for all\r\nnew applicants after December 1, 1989\") with Hanover, 301 S.C. at 55, 389 S.E.2d\r\nat 657 (stating the appeal was heard January 9, 1990).\r\n3 The supreme court did discuss subsection 38-77-350(B) later in Floyd, but it was\r\na separate discussion about the insurer's entitlement to the presumption available in\r\nthat section, not about compliance with the Wannamaker test or section 38-77-160.\r\n4See Ray v. Austin, 388 S.C. 605, 611, 698 S.E.2d 208, 212 (2010); Croft v. Old\r\nRepublic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 418, 618 S.E.2d 909, 917 (2005); Progressive\r\nCas. Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 348-49, 608 S.E.2d at 571; Bower, 351 S.C. at 116, 569\r\nS.E.2d at 315; Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 759\r\n(1996).\r\n\nWiegand v. U.S. Auto. Ass'n, 391 S.C. 159, 164, 705 S.E.2d 432, 435 (2011)\r\n(quoting Grinnell Corp. v. Wood, 389 S.C. 350, 357, 698 S.E.2d 796, 799-800\r\n(2010)).\r\n\r\nWe now expressly recognize it,5 and hold that an insurer's noncompliance with\r\nsubsection 38-77-350(B) does not render the use of the subsection 38-77-350(A)\r\nform a \"noncomplying offer.\" Rather, the phrase \"noncomplying offer,\" as used in\r\nHanover, Floyd, and other cases, refers to an offer that is not meaningful under\r\nWannamaker. Therefore, the insurer's inability to get the conclusive presumption\r\nunder subsection 38-77-350(B) does not mean the insurer did not make a\r\nmeaningful offer in compliance with section 38-77-160. Rather, it simply means\r\nthe trial court must make the factual determination of whether the insurer made a\r\nmeaningful offer. The trial court made that factual determination here.\r\n\r\nOur holding is consistent with, if not mandated by, Floyd. In that case, the\r\nsupreme court answered \"no\" to this specific question: \"Is an offer form in which\r\nthe blanks were filled in by an insurance agent . . . , and the form was then signed\r\nby the named insured, properly completed and executed pursuant to [subsection]\r\n38-77-350(B) . . . ?\" 367 S.C. at 258-59, 263, 626 S.E.2d at 9-10, 12. The court\r\nheld, therefore, the insurer was \"denied the benefit of the conclusive statutory\r\npresumption a meaningful offer was made.\" 367 S.C. at 264, 626 S.E.2d at 12.\r\nThe court then stated, \"Such a case presents a factual issue[,] . . . whether a\r\nmeaningful offer was made to the insured pursuant to the Wannamaker analysis.\"\r\nId. The result of Floyd is that after a determination that the insurer was not entitled\r\nto the conclusive presumption under subsection 38-77-350(B) because the\r\ninsurance agent filled in the form, the case was returned to the district court for a\r\nfactual determination of whether the insurer made a meaningful offer of UIM. 367\r\nS.C. at 256, 263-64, 626 S.E.2d at 8, 12 (stating the supreme court answered the\r\n\r\n5 We say Wiegand \"implicitly\" recognized what we now hold because the issue\r\nthere was different, and thus the case is distinguishable. In Wiegand, the court\r\ndealt with the sufficiency of the form, and not exclusively with the manner of its\r\ncompletion by the insured, see 391 S.C. at 164-65, 705 S.E.2d at 435, and the\r\ncourt's holding was that the insurer did get the conclusive presumption. Further,\r\nthe quoted comment specifically mentions \"failure to comply with [sub]section 38-\r\n77-350(A),\" 391 S.C. at 164, 705 S.E.2d at 435, while the issue in this case is the\r\nsignificance of noncompliance with subsection 38-77-350(B).\r\n\nquestion on certification from the district court, leaving \"a factual issue for\r\nresolution by the factfinder\"). This precise scenario exists in this case—after a\r\ndetermination that the insurer was not entitled to the presumption because the\r\ninsurance agent filled in the form, the trial court made the factual determination of\r\nwhether the insurer made a meaningful offer under Wannamaker and section 38-\r\n77-160.\r\n\r\nWe do not address the parties' remaining arguments.

He argues the family court erred\r\nin (1) giving him an insufficient credit for contributing nonmarital property and (2)\r\nfinding his use of alcohol constituted habitual intoxication. We affirm but modify\r\nthe family court's order as discussed below.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife married in 1978. The marriage produced two children, both of\r\nwhom were emancipated by the end of June 2000. In 1993, Husband acquired\r\nfrom his mother a waterfront lot (Lot 34) on which the parties subsequently\r\nconstructed the marital home, a swimming pool, and a dock. In exchange for the\r\ntitle to the lot, Husband disclaimed any future inheritance from his mother. Prior\r\nto the construction of the home, Husband conveyed a one-half interest in the lot to\r\nWife.\r\n\r\nWife left the marital home on Labor Day weekend in 2010. On October 4, 2010,\r\nshe filed an action seeking a divorce on the ground of Husband's habitual\r\nintoxication. Husband answered, denying fault, alleging Wife's drinking\r\ncontributed to the breakdown of the marriage, and seeking an order of separation.\r\n\r\nFollowing a failed mediation in November 2010, on April 8, 2011, the parties\r\nparticipated in an arbitration that resulted in an agreement settling, among other\r\nissues, alimony and the division of personal property. The remaining issues were\r\ntried before the family court.\r\n\r\nI.    Trial Testimony\r\n\r\nAt trial, Wife testified the parties had \"struggled for years to try to make the\r\nmarriage work,\" but it fell apart because Husband drank alcohol to excess and\r\nbecame loud, rude, and verbally abusive when he drank. In addition, she believed\r\nHusband's drinking enhanced his lack of respect for her and her contributions.\r\n\r\nIn general, Wife described Husband as behaving worse with every drink and going\r\nto bed drunk at 8:00 p.m. each night. Nevertheless, he woke up \"bright and\r\ncheery\" between 6:30 and 7:00 each morning and served Wife toast and coffee in\r\nbed until she moved to a different bedroom. According to Wife, Husband's\r\ndrinking increased on the weekends, when he would begin drinking around noon or\r\n1:00 p.m. However, she conceded Husband's drinking did not prevent him from\r\ngetting up and preparing her coffee and toast each morning, participating in\r\nhousework, and earning an income that supported their comfortable lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wife admitted drinking cocktails, she denied drinking to excess. She\r\nrated Husband's drinking at nine on a ten-point scale and her own at either four or\r\nfive. She recalled Husband stopped drinking after she told him she was\r\n\nconsidering divorce, but he began again approximately two weeks later. She stated\r\nshe had suggested Husband needed professional help to overcome his alcohol\r\nproblem, but he refused. Wife noted neither Husband's bout with prostate cancer\r\nnor Husband's drinking benefited their sexual relationship.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Lot 34, Wife testified the property was first titled only in Husband's\r\nname. She recalled telling him it would need to be in her name as well, \"not only\r\nbecause [they] always owned everything jointly, [but also because they] were\r\ngoing to need [her] income\" to qualify for a $200,000 construction loan. Shortly\r\nthereafter, Husband deeded Wife an undivided one-half ownership in the lot. Wife\r\nbelieved Husband intended that they own the property jointly. Additionally, Wife\r\ntestified she was the financial manager of the marital partnership.\r\n\r\nWife also presented the testimony of her sisters, her brother-in-law, and a family\r\nfriend, who supported her claim that Husband became mean and insulting toward\r\nher when he drank. Each witness described at least one event when Husband's\r\nintoxication led him to behave erratically or unusually. Although they\r\nacknowledged Wife occasionally drank alcoholic beverages, they testified she\r\nrarely became intoxicated.\r\n\r\nHusband testified that as a financial consultant, he had handled investments for\r\nmany family members, as well as institutional investors. In addition to work,\r\nHusband described supporting Wife's employment decisions, caring for her after\r\nher foot surgeries, serving her breakfast daily, and sharing in household chores.\r\n\r\nHusband admitted drinking alcohol to excess at times and admitted doing so seven\r\ndays a week just before Wife left. In his own estimation, he consumed a little\r\nmore alcohol than Wife: if his consumption were nine on a ten-point scale, he\r\nstated Wife's \"would have to be a seven or eight.\" He stated he had \"absolutely\"\r\nseen Wife intoxicated and that she had missed work at a former job because of her\r\noverindulgence. Husband believed both parties' drinking had \"put pressure\" on\r\ntheir familial relationships. Although he believed his own drinking significantly\r\naffected the marital relationship, he also believed the breakdown of Wife's\r\nrelationship with his mother also caused \"discomfort.\"1\r\n\r\n1 Wife, who had previously been very close to Husband's mother, distanced herself\r\nfrom her mother-in-law after a disagreement about how the parties should handle\r\ntheir daughter's wedding. This disagreement occurred approximately three years\r\nbefore trial.\r\n\nHusband recalled two conversations with Wife concerning alcohol's impact on\r\ntheir lives and their marriage counselor's recommendation that they \"examine [it]\r\nclosely.\" He admitted his attempt to quit lasted only a week but stated, \"you know,\r\nhave a glass of wine and all of a sudden everybody is drinking again,\" including\r\nWife. Husband testified he \"might have [had] two, three, four drinks\" of two to\r\nthree ounces of Scotch daily. At the time of trial, he stated he had decreased his\r\nintake of alcohol and no longer drank to excess, but he had never entered a\r\ntreatment program.\r\n\r\nHusband stated the parties had approximately $900,000 in equity in the marital\r\nhome and land. He believed the value of the house accounted for one third of the\r\nequity, with the land holding the remaining value. He reasoned Wife was entitled\r\nto half the equity in the house alone, while he was entitled to the other half, plus\r\nthe full value of the equity in the land beneath it. As a result, Husband concluded\r\nWife was entitled to one sixth of the value of the parties' equity in the marital\r\nhome, and he should have the rest. However, he conceded advising Wife at one\r\npoint that she should not leave him yet, because when the marital home\r\nappreciated in value, she would likely receive more than the $400,000 to which she\r\nwas then entitled.\r\n\r\nHusband also presented the testimony of General Charles Barnhill, Jr., an expert\r\nreal estate appraiser. General Barnhill testified the fair market value of the marital\r\nhome was $1,300,000, with the lot alone representing $850,000 of that amount.\r\n\r\nII.   Documentary Evidence\r\n\r\nThe parties submitted copies of various financial records, the deeds and disclaimer\r\nto which they referred in their testimony, and the mortgages encumbering the\r\nmarital home. In addition, they provided copies of documents showing the values\r\nof Lot 34 and the marital home in 1994 – a tax assessment valuing Lot 34 at\r\n$127,000 and an appraisal report valuing the land at $200,000 and the home and\r\nland together at $425,000. The parties also submitted an appraisal report valuing\r\nLot 34 and the marital home in 2010. The appraiser arrived at values of $850,000\r\nfor Lot 34 alone and $1,225,000 for the home and lot.\r\n\nIII.   Final and Amended Final Orders\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2011, the family court entered its final order. It recited and\r\nincorporated the parties' arbitration agreement as part of the order. With regard to\r\nfault, the family court found Husband admitted habitually \"drinking three or more\r\nalcoholic drinks of two to three ounces\" daily at the time the parties separated.\r\nAccording to the family court, Wife and four other witnesses had testified\r\nHusband's frequent intoxication impaired and damaged both the marriage and the\r\nparties' interactions with others outside the home. By contrast, Husband presented\r\nno testimony supporting his contentions about Wife's drinking. The family court\r\nconcluded, \"Husband's habitual drinking led to the breakdown of the marital\r\nrelationship.\"\r\n\r\nThe family court accepted the parties' stipulation that the marital home was marital\r\nproperty valued at $1,300,000 and awarded Husband possession of it. The family\r\ncourt reviewed South Carolina law allowing for \"special consideration\" of\r\ninherited property or property exchanged for inherited property at the time of\r\nequitable division. In evaluating the statutory factors for equitable distribution, the\r\nfamily court found significant the fact that \"Husband's contribution of the lot was\r\nfrom a gift and a waiver of his right to further inheritance from his father's estate.\"\r\nThe family court awarded Husband a fifty-five-percent interest in the parties'\r\nequity in the marital home and Wife, a forty-five-percent interest. The family\r\ncourt based its decision upon an analysis of the statutory factors, including\r\nHusband's fault, both parties' contributions to the marriage, Husband's superior\r\nincome and educational credentials, and the parties' individual retirement accounts.\r\n\r\nIn view of its decision concerning apportionment, and allowing for advances Wife\r\nhad already received from marital assets, the family court required Husband to pay\r\nWife $285,698.42 \"to effect a fifty[-]percent distribution of the parties' non-real\r\nestate marital assets.\" In addition, it ordered Husband to pay approximately half of\r\nWife's attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nIV.    Rule 59(e) Motion\r\n\r\nHusband filed a motion to alter or amend, seeking a greater credit for his\r\ncontribution of nonmarital property and clarification of particular aspects of the\r\noverall apportionment award, and requesting the family court make findings of fact\r\nsupporting the award of attorney's fees to Wife.\r\n\nOn July 18, 2011, the family court heard arguments on the motion. Husband\r\npointed to testimony valuing Lot 34 at between $120,000 and $200,000 at the time\r\nhe deeded a half-interest in it to Wife. Furthermore, he contended the lot had\r\nundergone passive appreciation during the marriage, arriving at a value of\r\n$850,000, with the house valued at an additional $400,000 at the time of\r\ncommencement of litigation. According to Husband, prior cases suggested the\r\nfamily court should have been \"more liberal in giving him credit for that original\r\ncontribution.\" In addition, Husband asked the family court to clarify whether it\r\nintended, as portions of the final order stated, to divide the equity in the marital\r\nhome fifty-five/forty-five but the overall marital estate fifty/fifty. Wife joined in\r\nHusband's request for clarification but maintained the family court had correctly\r\napportioned the equity in the marital home.\r\n\r\nOn August 4, 2011, the family court entered an amended final order. Although the\r\namended final order included additional findings of fact and some minor\r\nmodifications, the family court did not disturb its findings concerning Husband's\r\nfault or the apportionment and division of property. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In appeals from the family court, [appellate courts] review[] factual and legal\r\nissues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667\r\n(2011). \"[W]hile retaining the authority to make our own findings of fact, we\r\nrecognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011).\r\nThe burden is upon the appellant to convince the appellate court that the\r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the family court's findings. Id. \"Stated\r\ndifferently, de novo review neither relieves an appellant of demonstrating error nor\r\nrequires us to ignore the findings of the family court.\" Id. at 388-89, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n654.\r\n\r\nHowever, appellate courts, in reviewing the equitable division of marital property,\r\nlook at the overall apportionment for fairness. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289,\r\n300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37,\r\n39-40, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988)).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Contribution of Nonmarital Property\r\n\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in giving him insufficient credit for his\r\ncontribution of nonmarital property.2 We agree in part.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has recognized \"a transmutation of inherited nonmarital\r\nproperty into marital property [does] not extinguish the inheritor's right for special\r\nconsideration upon divorce.\" Dawkins v. Dawkins, 386 S.C. 169, 173, 687 S.E.2d\r\n52, 54 (2010), abrogated on other grounds by Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 709\r\nS.E.2d 650 (2011) (citation omitted). Furthermore, our supreme court held that\r\n\"the correct way to treat [an] inheritance is as a contribution by [the inheriting\r\nparty] to the acquisition of marital property [and that] [t]his contribution should be\r\ntaken into account in determining the percentage of the marital estate to which [the\r\ninheriting party] is equitably entitled upon distribution.\" Id. at 173-74, 687 S.E.2d\r\nat 54 (alterations in original) (quoting Toler v. Toler, 292 S.C. 374, 380 n.1, 356\r\nS.E.2d 429, 432 n.1 (Ct. App. 1987)).\r\n\r\nWe affirm, but modify the family court's order to award Husband a fifty-five-\r\npercent share, and Wife a forty-five-percent share, of the entire marital estate, not\r\njust the equity in the marital home. In his argument before the family court and on\r\nappeal, Husband conceded the property had been transmuted and the marital home\r\nwas marital property. The family court properly analyzed this issue by\r\ndetermining Husband's contribution of the land on which the parties constructed\r\ntheir home deserved special consideration. See id. (confirming the inheriting\r\nparty's contribution of inherited property that is later transmuted \"should be taken\r\ninto account in determining the percentage of the marital estate to which [the\r\ninheriting party] is equitably entitled upon distribution\"). The evidence reflects\r\nthat when Husband received title to Lot 34 from his mother in 1993, the lot was\r\nappraised at $200,000. Within one month, Husband contributed Lot 34 to the\r\nmarital estate by transferring half of his ownership interest to Wife. Giving\r\nHusband the benefit of the doubt, the value of his contribution at that time was\r\napproximately $200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n2While Husband concedes Wife is entitled to fifty percent of the non-real estate\r\nportion of the marital estate, he claims he is entitled to more than seventy-five\r\npercent of the equity in the marital home.\r\n\nThe lot remained marital property, jointly owned by Husband and Wife, from the\r\ntime of Husband's contribution until the filing of the divorce action. During that\r\nperiod of approximately seventeen years, the lot passively appreciated to a value of\r\n$850,000. We find each party is entitled to share in the passive appreciation in\r\nvalue that occurred while the lot was a part of the marital estate.\r\n\r\nNext, the family court evaluated and apportioned the equity in the marital home to\r\nreflect the quality of Husband's contribution. See S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-620(B)\r\n(Supp. 2012) (stating when a party has contributed to \"the acquisition,\r\npreservation, depreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property,\" the\r\nfamily court \"shall consider the quality of the contribution as well as its factual\r\nexistence\"). Having found Husband contributed Lot 34 and having determined the\r\nvalue of that contribution, the family court proceeded to weigh the value of\r\nHusband's contribution in its consideration of the fifteen statutory factors for\r\nequitable apportionment. See Dawkins, 386 S.C. at 173-74, 687 S.E.2d at 54\r\n(confirming the inheriting party's contribution of inherited property that is later\r\ntransmuted \"should be taken into account in determining the percentage of the\r\nmarital estate to which [the inheriting party] is equitably entitled upon\r\ndistribution\"); accord Barrow v. Barrow, 394 S.C. 603, 614, 716 S.E.2d 302, 308\r\n(Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\r\nIn complaining the family court's division does not fairly represent the value of his\r\ncontributions, Husband appears to ignore the family court's findings concerning the\r\nremaining factors, including his fault in the breakdown of the marriage. Findings\r\nthat militated in favor of reducing Husband's share of the equity include (1) Wife\r\nestablished that the marriage failed due to Husband's habitual drunkenness, (2)\r\nHusband failed to prove Wife's consumption of alcohol rose to the level of habitual\r\ndrunkenness, (3) great disparities existed between Husband's and Wife's respective\r\neducations and earning capacities, and (4) Wife was the financial manager of the\r\nmarital partnership. In addition, the family court's award to Husband of the marital\r\nhome required Wife to secure other lodging.\r\n\r\nWe find the family court properly afforded special consideration to Husband's\r\ncontribution of Lot 34. While we agree with the family court's decision to award\r\nHusband a greater interest in the marital home, which constituted the bulk of the\r\nmarital estate, we hold the equity in the marital home should have been included in\r\n\nthe overall marital estate.3 See Dawkins, 386 S.C. at 173-74, 687 S.E.2d at 54\r\n(holding special consideration for the contribution of transmuted, inherited\r\nproperty affects \"the percentage of the marital estate to which [the inheriting party]\r\nis equitably entitled upon distribution\"). Moreover, since the bulk of the marital\r\nestate was tied up in the marital home and Husband made most of the material\r\ncontributions to the acquisition of the marital estate, the preponderance of the\r\nevidence reasonably supports a fifty-five/forty-five division of the entire estate.\r\nTherefore, we modify the family court's order to extend the fifty-five/forty-five\r\napportionment to the entire marital estate.\r\n\r\nWe adopt the family court's factual findings concerning property values, which\r\nindicate the marital estate consists of $907,889.01 in equity in the marital home\r\nand $198,760.01 in other assets, for a total value of $1,106,649.02. We find\r\nHusband receives value of $608,656.96 for his fifty-five-percent share. We further\r\nfind Wife receives value of $497,992.06 for her forty-five-percent share. Adhering\r\nto the family court's distribution of non-real estate assets, we find Wife received\r\nmarital assets valued at $193,231.63 and advances from the marital estate valued at\r\n$29,000. Accordingly, to complete the equitable division of the marital estate,\r\nHusband shall pay Wife $275,760.43 within one hundred twenty (120) days from\r\nthe date this opinion is filed.\r\n\r\nII.   Habitual Intoxication\r\n\r\nHusband asserts, and we agree, the family court erred in stating it could grant a\r\ndivorce based upon prima facie evidence of habitual intoxication. Nevertheless,\r\nwe hold the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates Wife was entitled to a\r\ndivorce based on habitual intoxication.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has held a party seeking temporary relief must make a \"prima\r\nfacie showing of probable cause for a divorce or separation.\" Fisher v. Fisher, 276\r\nS.C. 375, 377, 278 S.E.2d 780, 781 (1981).\r\n\r\nA family court may grant a divorce on the ground of habitual drunkenness. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 20-3-10(4) (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n3 We note the family court found Husband's contributions to the non-real estate\r\nportion of the marital estate were overwhelming when compared to Wife's\r\ncontributions.\r\n\n             Habitual drunkenness is the fixed habit of frequently\r\n             getting drunk; it does not necessarily imply continual\r\n             drunkenness. Based on this definition, one need not be\r\n             an alcoholic to be guilty of habitual drunkenness. It is\r\n             sufficient if the use or abuse of alcohol causes the\r\n             breakdown of normal marital relations.\r\n\r\nLee v. Lee, 282 S.C. 76, 78-79, 316 S.E.2d 435, 437 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\n\r\nIn the case at bar, the family court recited:\r\n\r\n             A divorce may be granted on the grounds of habitual\r\n             drunkenness if there is a prima facie showing that the\r\n             \"abuse of alcohol caused the breakdown of the marriage\r\n             and that such abuse existed at or near the time of the\r\n             filing for divorce.\" Bodkin v. Bodkin, 388 S.C. 203, 235,\r\n             694 S.E.2d 230 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing Epperly v.\r\n             Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1994)).\r\n\r\nNeither Bodkin nor Epperly permits the grant of a divorce based solely upon a\r\nprima facie showing of habitual drunkenness. Rather, both opinions describe the\r\nshowing a party must make to establish habitual drunkenness, quoted above by the\r\nfamily court, but they do not discuss the requisite level of proof. Bodkin v. Bodkin,\r\n388 S.C. 203, 212, 694 S.E.2d 230, 235 (Ct. App. 2010); Epperly v. Epperly, 312\r\nS.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1994). A party may receive temporary relief\r\nupon a prima facie showing of habitual drunkenness. Fisher, 276 S.C. at 377, 278\r\nS.E.2d at 781. However, a party seeking a divorce on that ground must prove it by\r\na preponderance of the evidence. Lee, 282 S.C. at 79, 316 S.E.2d at 437.\r\n\r\nWe find the preponderance of the evidence supports the family court's decision.\r\nThe party asserting fault must establish that the other party's \"abuse of alcohol\r\ncaused the breakdown of the marriage and that such abuse existed at or near the\r\ntime of filing for divorce.\" Bodkin, 388 S.C. at 212, 694 S.E.2d at 235 (quoting\r\nEpperly, 312 S.C. at 414, 440 S.E.2d at 885). Wife testified Husband drank\r\nalcohol to excess on a regular basis during the latter part of their marriage; became\r\nloud, rude, and verbally abusive when he drank alcohol and behaved worse with\r\nevery drink; routinely went to bed drunk at 8:00 p.m.; and refused to seek\r\nprofessional help to address his drinking. Wife also presented corroborating\r\ntestimony from her two sisters, her brother-in-law, and the parties' friend. One\r\n\nsister stated Husband's drinking had increased during the latter portion of the\r\nmarriage, and he became mean and insulting when he drank and \"thought he did\r\neverything and didn't give [Wife] much credit.\" Wife's brother-in-law observed\r\nHusband was especially mean and insulting toward Wife when he was drinking.\r\nEach of the four witnesses recalled at least one event when Husband's intoxication\r\nled him to behave erratically or unusually. The parties' friend testified she and her\r\nhusband had limited their association with the parties during the months before\r\nWife left, in part because they found Husband \"angry and difficult to be around\"\r\nwhen he was drinking.\r\n\r\nHusband did not present evidence rebutting this testimony. Rather, he admitted he\r\ndrank alcohol to excess seven days a week just before Wife left and stated alcohol\r\nconsumption had \"put pressure\" on their relationship. Husband recalled\r\ndiscussions about alcohol consumption with both Wife and their counselor. He\r\nalso admitted his attempt to stop drinking before Wife left failed after a week. His\r\ndefense consisted of complaints concerning Wife's drinking and testimony that,\r\ndespite his drinking, he functioned normally. In view of the record, we find the\r\npreponderance of the evidence supports the family court's finding that Husband's\r\nhabitual intoxication contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find Husband received special consideration for his contribution of Lot 34 to\r\nthe marital estate. However, we find the family court's equitable apportionment\r\nscheme improperly segregated the equity in the marital home from the remainder\r\nof the marital estate. Accordingly, we affirm the family court's decision but\r\nmodify its award so that Husband receives a fifty-five-percent share of the entire\r\nmarital estate and Wife receives a forty-five percent share.\r\n\r\nIn view of our finding that the preponderance of the evidence establishes\r\nHusband's abuse of alcohol caused the breakdown of the marriage, we find\r\nHusband suffered no prejudice from the family court's incorrect statement of the\r\nstandard of proof. Accordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5087","title":"Simmons v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nSimmons was a participant in the SC STRONG program. SC STRONG is a\r\nresidential, non-profit organization in which \"former substance abusers, ex-\r\nconvicts, and homeless adults\" are provided with educational and vocational\r\n\nopportunities. Simmons began participating in the SC STRONG program in May\r\n2010 as a condition of his probation.1 On May 18, 2010, Simmons signed a\r\nResident Statement, which provided:\r\n\r\n                      (1) Any remuneration which was, or in the future will be,\r\n                          due because of work which I have performed, or will\r\n                          perform, for South Carolina STRONG, I donate to South\r\n                          Carolina STRONG. This donation is done freely, and\r\n                          without duress.\r\n\r\n                      (2) Any work, which I have done, or will do, for South\r\n                          Carolina STRONG, is done as a volunteer without any\r\n                          expectation of remuneration.\r\n\r\n                      (3) Not withstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, if any\r\n                          governmental body determines that I am not a volunteer\r\n                          or cannot donate to South Carolina STRONG any\r\n                          remuneration which might be due to me from South\r\n                          Carolina STRONG, then I state that I was more than\r\n                          adequately paid by room, board, and services that I\r\n                          received from South Carolina STRONG including\r\n                          counseling, vocational training, entertainment, clothing,\r\n                          medical and dental services, education, rehabilitation,\r\n                          transportation, recreational and legal services, which\r\n                          have, and will be, provided to me by South Carolina\r\n                          STRONG free of charge for the duration of my time as a\r\n                          resident of South Carolina STRONG.\r\n\r\nAs a SC STRONG participant, Simmons worked at various landscaping and\r\nconstruction projects at the direction of SC STRONG. On January 14, 2011,\r\nSimmons slipped on ice and fell thirty feet off a roof at a SC STRONG jobsite.\r\nSimmons was treated at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). A\r\ncervical CT scan revealed Simmons suffered a C-5 anterior superior end plate\r\nfracture. Additionally, Simmons's head CT scan revealed a soft tissue\r\nlaceration/hematoma over the left frontal bone. Simmons received staples for his\r\nforehead laceration. On January 15, 2011, Simmons returned to the emergency\r\n                                                            \r\n1 Simmons pled guilty to two counts of second-degree burglary in March 2009.\r\nSimmons requested he be allowed to participate in the SC STRONG program at\r\nthe time of his plea.\r\n\nroom complaining of foot pain and facial swelling. Simmons was given\r\noxycodone and a hard cervical collar. The instructions provided by MUSC\r\nrequired Simmons to wear the collar at all times to protect his neck while his\r\n\"compression fracture\" healed. The instructions further noted that Simmons's\r\nfracture was \"not serious\" and he could \"expect to fully recover within a few\r\nweeks.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 2011, Simmons filed a Form 50 alleging he injured his head and\r\ncervical spine in the course of his employment with SC STRONG. Simmons\r\nrequested temporary total disability benefits at a rate based on a similar employee.\r\nOn March 2, 2011, Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company (Hartford), SC\r\nSTRONG's insurance carrier, filed a Form 51 wherein it denied Simmons was an\r\nemployee of SC STRONG and sustained a compensable injury arising out of\r\nemployment with SC STRONG. On March 16, 2011, Hartford and SC STRONG\r\n(collectively Respondents) filed an amended Form 51 again alleging Simmons did\r\nnot sustain a compensable injury in the course of his employment as alleged.\r\nRespondents filed a second amended Form 51 on April, 25, 2011, adding a denial\r\nthat Simmons was an employee of SC STRONG.\r\n\r\nA hearing was held before the single commissioner on May 25, 2011. At the\r\nhearing, Simmons testified he was provided room, board, and daily work\r\ninstructions by SC STRONG. Simmons further testified he worked six days a\r\nweek and was performing work for SC STRONG when he fell on January 14,\r\n2011. According to Simmons, he was forced to leave SC STRONG after he\r\ncontacted an attorney following his accident.\r\n\r\nJohn Tecklenburg, President of SC STRONG's Board of Directors, testified SC\r\nSTRONG has only two employees: John Glemser, the executive director, and\r\nJohn Hamilton, the co-executive director and vocational training supervisor.\r\nAccording to Tecklenburg, SC STRONG receives compensation for the\r\nconstruction services provided by its participants. Tecklenburg stated the SC\r\nSTRONG model \"involves a sustainable concept whereby the work training that\r\nwe do for our residents is utilized as an enterprise to help generate funds that run\r\nthe organization.\" Tecklenburg testified the food, clothing, and shelter provided to\r\nSimmons as a SC STRONG participant were not provided in lieu of wages.\r\nAdditionally, Hamilton testified participants are provided with tools and given\r\nwork assignments by SC STRONG and are not allowed to seek independent work\r\nwhile enrolled in the program. Hamilton further testified SC STRONG\r\nparticipants do not have any expectation of wages.\r\n\nFollowing the hearing, the single commissioner found Simmons was not entitled to\r\nworkers' compensation benefits because he was a volunteer and/or gratuitous\r\nworker and not an employee of SC STRONG. In his finding of fact number six,\r\nthe single commissioner noted Simmons would have been entitled to temporary\r\ntotal disability benefits had he been an employee of SC STRONG but reiterated\r\nSimmons was not an employee. Following a hearing in November 2011, the\r\nAppellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner on December 20, 2011. The\r\nAppellate Panel adopted the single commissioner's order with the exception of\r\nfinding of fact number six. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The existence of an employer-employee relationship is a factual question that\r\ndetermines the jurisdiction of the Workers' Compensation Commission.\" Shuler v.\r\nTri-County Elec. Co-op., Inc., 374 S.C. 516, 520, 649 S.E.2d 98, 100 (Ct. App.\r\n2007), aff'd, 385 S.C. 470, 472, 684 S.E.2d 765, 767 (2009). \"When an issue\r\ninvolves jurisdiction, the appellate court can take its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\" Id. \"In determining jurisdictional questions,\r\ndoubts of jurisdiction will be resolved in favor of inclusion of employees within\r\nworkers' compensation coverage rather than exclusion.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSimmons argues he was an employee of SC STRONG and thus entitled to workers'\r\ncompensation benefits. We disagree.\r\n\r\nUnder the Workers' Compensation Act, an employee is defined as\r\n\r\n      every person engaged in an employment under any\r\n      appointment, contract of hire, or apprenticeship, expressed or\r\n      implied, oral or written, . . . whether lawfully or unlawfully\r\n      employed, but excludes a person whose employment is both\r\n      casual and not in the course of the trade, business, profession,\r\n      or occupation of his employer . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-130 (Supp. 2012). \"To be considered an employee under a\r\ncontract of hire pursuant to section 42-1-130, a person must have a right to\r\npayment for his services.\" Shuler v. Tri-County Elec. Co-op, Inc., 385 S.C. 470,\r\n473, 684 S.E.2d 765, 767 (2009) (citing Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 314 S.C.\r\n43, 45, 443 S.E.2d 803, 804 (1994) (finding unpaid daughter of store owner not an\r\n\nemployee)); see also Doe v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 323 S.C. 33, 39-40, 448 S.E.2d\r\n564, 567-68 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding an unpaid volunteer candy striper was not\r\nthe employee of a hospital); McCreery v. Covenant Presbyterian, 299 S.C. 218,\r\n223-24, 383 S.E.2d 264, 267 (1989) (finding an unpaid church volunteer not an\r\nemployee of the church for workers' compensation purposes), rev'd on other\r\ngrounds, 303 S.C. 271, 400 S.E.2d 130 (1990).\r\n\r\nHere, the Appellate Panel, relying on Shuler, Kirksey, and McCreery, found\r\nSimmons was a volunteer and/or gratuitous worker. The Appellate Panel held the\r\nterm \"contract of hire\" connoted payment and \"a worker who neither receives nor\r\nexpects payment for his services is not generally considered an employee within\r\nthe definition.\" On appeal, Simmons maintains that although he did not receive\r\nany monetary payments for the work he performed as a SC STRONG participant,\r\nhe received benefits from SC STRONG for his work in the form of housing,\r\nclothing, and food.\r\n\r\nWe find Simmons was a volunteer/gratuitous worker. Simmons neither received\r\nnor expected to receive any kind of pay for his services. Pursuant to his Resident\r\nAgreement, Simmons acknowledged he was a volunteer and was not owed any\r\nremuneration for his services. Furthermore, the room and board Simmons received\r\nas a SC STRONG participant were not provided as payment for his work. Rather,\r\nSimmons, as well as all of the other SC STRONG participants, were provided a\r\nresidential setting to \"develop their strengths through learning - and teaching -\r\nacademics and vocational skills, as well as personal, interpersonal, and practical\r\n'survival skills.'\" As a SC STRONG participant, Simmons was learning skills to\r\naid in his transition into the working world. Simmons was not performing services\r\nas an employee of SC STRONG; rather, he was performing services as a volunteer\r\nin a rehabilitative program to improve his skills and avoid incarceration.\r\n\r\nSimmons relies on Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, 447 S.E.2d 841\r\n(1994) to support his position that South Carolina does not require a particular\r\nform of payment to establish an employee/employer relationship. In Wilson, the\r\ncircuit court allowed Wilson, who informed the court he could not sit on a jury\r\nbecause of his religious beliefs, to perform janitorial services in lieu of jury\r\nservice. Id. at 93, 447 S.E.2d at 842. Wilson was injured when he slipped and fell\r\nwhile washing the courthouse windows. Id. Our supreme court found Wilson was\r\nan employee of Georgetown County when he fell because the work he was\r\nperforming was for the benefit of the County, and he was under the direction and\r\ncontrol of the Clerk of Court. Id. at 94, 447 S.E.2d at 842-43. Here, Simmons\r\nargues SC STRONG billed its customers for the services he performed, and\r\n\ntherefore, his work was for the benefit of SC STRONG. We find Wilson is\r\ndistinguishable from the present case. The circuit court required Wilson to\r\nperform janitorial services in lieu of jury service. Simmons was an admitted\r\nvolunteer who chose to participate in the SC STRONG program in lieu of serving\r\nhis prison sentence.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find Simmons was not an employee of SC\r\nSTRONG. Therefore, we affirm the Appellate Panel's determination that Simmons\r\nwas not entitled to workers' compensation coverage.2\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n2 Simmons also argues he was an apprentice in the SC STRONG program, and\r\nthus, he was entitled to workers' compensation coverage.

She argues the Appellate Panel\r\nerred in: (1) basing her average weekly wage on Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission (Commission) Form 20; (2) failing to find her neurogenic bladder\r\nrelated to her back injury; and (3) denying her claim for partial paraplegia. We\r\naffirm.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 2008, Williams was working as a drywall finisher for David \n\r\nStafford Drywall1 when she fell 12 to 14 feet. As a result of the accident, on\n\r\nDecember 22, 2008, Williams filed a Form 50, claiming she injured her left ankle \n\r\nbone, pelvis, right foot, left foot, right hip, and left hip. On June 8, 2009, she filed \n\r\nan amended Form 50, asserting injuries to her left hip, left leg, pelvis, right leg, \n\r\nback, brain, head, and left foot. Williams filed her second amended Form 50 on \n\r\nJanuary 6, 2010, more than one year after the accident, claiming she injured her \n\r\nleft hip, left leg, pelvis, right leg, back, brain, head, left foot, and for the first time, \n\r\nher bowels and bladder. Respondents admitted the accident, but only as to \n\r\nWilliams' injuries to her left leg, spine, and pelvis. Respondents denied Williams\n\r\nwas permanently and totally disabled. Williams challenged her average weekly \n\r\nwage and compensation rates, claiming her compensation rate should be $253.35. \n\r\n\r\nThe Single Commissioner held a hearing on the matter on March 22, 2010. The \n\r\nCommissioner issued his order on May 10, 2010, finding Williams sustained \n\r\ninjuries only to her back, pelvis, and her left leg. He found she was permanently \n\r\nand totally disabled as a result of the combination of her injuries, pursuant to \n\r\nsection 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code, and was entitled to five-hundred \n\r\nweeks of compensation, less weeks paid. He determined Williams' average weekly \n\r\nwage was $198.08, with a compensation rate of $132.05, and provided her award \n\r\nbe paid in lump sum.2 The Commissioner ordered Respondents to pay for all past, \n\r\npresent, and future causally-related medical treatment, excluding any treatment \n\r\nWilliams sought from unauthorized providers. He further ordered Respondents to \n\r\npay for all lifetime repair, replacement, removal, and maintenance of any causally-\n\r\nrelated retained hardware. \n\r\n\r\nWilliams filed a request for Commission review on May 18, 2010, which was \n\r\ndenied by the Commissioner on August 16, 2010.3 On August 3, 2010, Williams\n\r\nfiled a motion to submit additional and newly discovered evidence. Williams then \n\r\nappealed to the Appellate Panel, and a hearing was held on September 21, 2010. \n\r\n\r\n1 David Stafford Drywall and Accident Insurance Company are the Respondents \n\r\n(collectively, Respondents).\n\r\n2 Williams accepted payment of this award on June 29, 2010.\n\r\n3 Williams did not appeal the Commissioner's denial of her claims for the right \n\r\nleg, left hip, brain, head, or bowel. \n\r\n\nThe Appellate Panel issued its order affirming the Commissioner's order in its\r\nentirety on December 17, 2010. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard\r\nfor judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel. Carolinas Recycling Grp.\r\nv. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 398 S.C. 480, 483, 730 S.E.2d 324, 326 (Ct. App.\r\n2012). Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the\r\nevidence on questions of fact, but may reverse or modify the Appellate Panel's\r\ndecision if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced because the\r\ndecision is affected by an error of law or is \"clearly erroneous in view of the\r\nreliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\" See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2012). Our supreme court has defined substantial\r\nevidence as evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow\r\nreasonable minds to reach the same conclusion the Appellate Panel reached. Lark\r\nv. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). \"[T]he possibility\r\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\nadministrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\"\r\nPalmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d\r\n695, 696 (1984). \"Where there are no disputed facts, the question of whether an\r\naccident is compensable is a question of law.\" Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C.\r\n196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 872 (2007).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Form 20\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the Appellate Panel erred in basing her average weekly wage on\r\nCommission Form 20. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code provides four alternative methods for\r\nthe commission to use to calculate the average wage. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-40\r\n(Supp. 2012); see Pilgrim v. Eaton, 391 S.C. 38, 44, 703 S.E.2d 241, 244 (Ct. App.\r\n2010). The primary method of calculation requires that the \"'[a]verage weekly\r\nwage' must be calculated by taking the total wages paid for the last four quarters . .\r\n. divided by fifty-two or by the actual number of weeks for which wages were paid,\r\nwhichever is less.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-40 (Supp. 2012). However, \"[w]hen\r\n\nfor exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or\r\nemployee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted\r\nto as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would\r\nbe earning were it not for the injury.\" Id. \"The statute provides an elasticity or\r\nflexibility with a view toward always achieving the ultimate objective of reflecting\r\nfairly a claimant's probable future earning loss.\" Sellers v. Pinedale Residential\r\nCtr., 350 S.C. 183, 191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 698 (Ct. App. 2002). \"'The objective of\r\nwage calculation is to arrive at a fair approximation of the claimant's probable\r\nfuture earning capacity.'\" Id. (quoting Bennett v. Gary Smith Builders, 271 S.C.\r\n94, 98, 245 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1978)).\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the Appellate Panel erred in basing her average weekly wage on\r\nthe Form 20 because it does not include all her wages and violates section 42-1-40\r\nof the South Carolina Code. Williams bases this assertion on Stafford's testimony\r\nduring the March 22, 2010 hearing. When questioned, Stafford testified Williams\r\nearned $76 per day when she was working for him. He said some wage records\r\nmay have been left out of the computation because he could not find them. He\r\nfurther answered \"yes\" to the following question: \"And I think you indicated in\r\nyour deposition, I asked you is it fair to say she made more money working for you\r\nthan she is getting right now?\"\r\n\r\nWilliams also argues the Form 20 was not completed correctly because it divides\r\nher total wages by fifty-two weeks, and she did not work all fifty-two weeks in the\r\nyear preceding her injury. Williams claims she earned $76 per day, or $380 per\r\nweek, resulting in a compensation rate of $253.35. Williams did not introduce any\r\nwage records or pay stubs to support the higher compensation rate.\r\n\r\nThe Form 20 filed by Respondents claimed Williams' average weekly wage was\r\n$198.08, with a weekly compensation rate of $132.05. Stafford testified the Form\r\n20 included all the wages he could find at the time. He stated they worked some\r\nweeks and some weeks they did not. He added that for the last year-and-a-half to\r\ntwo years \"work was just awful.\"\r\n\r\nThe Single Commissioner found the average weekly wage and compensation rate\r\nshould remain as stated in the Form 20 because he saw no reason to deviate from\r\nthe Form 20, and Williams did not present any additional evidence to support an\r\nincrease in her wages. He also noted Stafford testified he \"used all of her wages he\r\nlocated and that work had been very slow prior to her accident.\" Further, the\r\nCommissioner stated Williams \"agreed that if David Stafford prepared a wage\r\n\nstatement on her behalf she would accept it as being accurate,\" and she \"conceded\r\nthat the number of hours she worked was affected by the availability of work.\"\r\nAdditionally, she agreed she has received temporary disability compensation since\r\nthe date of the injury at the current compensation rate and had not challenged it as\r\nbeing inaccurate until now. Therefore, we find substantial evidence in the record\r\nsupports the Appellate Panel's decision not to deviate from the primary method of\r\ncalculation as provided in section 42-1-40.\r\n\r\nII.   Bladder Problem\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the Appellate Panel erred in failing to find her neurogenic bladder\r\nrelated to her back injury. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThis court must affirm the Appellate Panel's findings of fact if they are supported\r\nby substantial evidence. Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333,\r\n338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\nreasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.\" Id. \"[T]he\r\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\nprevent an administrative agency's findings from being supported by substantial\r\nevidence.\" Id. This court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency's\r\nas to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the agency's findings\r\nare clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on\r\nthe record. Id. at 339, 513 S.E.2d at 845.\r\n\r\nWhen determining if a claimant has established causation, the Appellate Panel has\r\ndiscretion to weigh and consider all the evidence, both lay and expert. Potter v.\r\nSpartanburg Sch. Dist. 7, 395 S.C. 17, 23, 716 S.E.2d 123, 126 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\"Thus, while medical testimony is entitled to great respect, the fact finder may\r\ndisregard it if other competent evidence is presented.\" Id. The Appellate Panel has\r\nthe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded the\r\nevidence. Id. \"If a medical expert is unwilling to state with certainty a connection\r\nbetween an accident and an injury, the 'expression of a cautious opinion' may\r\nsupport an award if there are facts outside the medical testimony that also support\r\nan award.\" Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846. \"Proof that a claimant\r\nsustained an injury may be established by circumstantial and direct evidence where\r\ncircumstances lead an unprejudiced mind to reasonably infer the injury was caused\r\nby the accident.\" Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 846-47. The extent of impairment need\r\nnot be shown with mathematical precision; however, an award \"may not rest on\r\n\nsurmise, conjecture, or speculation; it must be founded on evidence of sufficient\r\nsubstance to afford it a reasonable basis.\" Linen v. Ruscon Constr. Co., 286 S.C.\r\n67, 68, 332 S.E.2d 211, 212 (1985).\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the Appellate Panel erred in failing to find her neurogenic bladder\r\nwas related to her injury. Williams asserts she repeatedly mentioned to Dr. Robert\r\nAlexander, of the Spine and Orthopaedic Specialists of South Carolina, P.A., that\r\nher bladder was leaking and she was urinating on herself. She further asserts he\r\ntold her that was \"not a type of problem he could handle\" and did not write her\r\ncomplaints in her medical records. Williams independently saw Dr. Steven Poletti,\r\nof the Southeastern Spine Institute, on July 15, 2009, and his notes suggest\r\nWilliams was suffering from \"some measure of bowel and bladder dysfunction.\"\r\nWilliams then independently saw Dr. Eric Rovner, a urologist at MUSC, on\r\nFebruary 2, 2010, and as a result, he concluded she has \"urge urinary incontinence\r\nand stress urinary incontinence\" as a result of her work related accident. Dr.\r\nPoletti's notes from a February 3, 2010 visit state Williams saw Dr. Rovner and\r\nwas diagnosed with voiding dysfunction. Williams also independently saw Dr.\r\nTimothy Zgleszewski, of Palmetto Spine Sports Medicine, P.A., on January 20,\r\n2010, and his notes mention a diagnosis of neurogenic voiding dysfunction.\r\nAdditionally, on March 3, 2010, Williams independently saw Dr. Jeffrey Faaberg,\r\nof the Edisto Spine Center, Inc., and his notes state Williams has frequent urinary\r\nincontinence.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Single Commissioner stated Dr. Christopher Merrell's medical notes\r\nfrom her visits on December 18, 2008, March 3, 2009, and July 23, 2009, all noted\r\nWilliams had no bowel or bladder incontinence. Dr. Alexander's notes from her\r\nvisits on August 3, 2009, and October 12, 2009, state she denied any bowel or\r\nbladder changes. Therefore, the Commissioner found Williams repeatedly told the\r\nauthorized providers she did not have urinary incontinence. He further found that\r\n\"although Dr. Poletti diagnosed her with urinary problems during the first\r\n[independent medical exam], [Williams] testified that she never reported any\r\nurinary problems to him. Moreover, she testified that Dr. Poletti only met with her\r\nfor 10 minutes during the first [independent medical exam].\" Additionally, the\r\nCommissioner found that contrary to Dr. Rovner's report, the medical records from\r\nDr. Langdon Hartsock and Dr. Merrell, both also from MUSC, \"specifically note\r\nthat [Williams] was not suffering from urological problems following her\r\naccident.\" The Commissioner noted that during the hearing, Williams testified she\r\nwas open and honest with Dr. Hartsock and Dr. Merrell about all of her symptoms\r\nand problems and was happy with their treatment. Furthermore, she acknowledged\r\n\nshe did not raise any complaints about Dr. Alexander's treatment during her\r\ndiscovery deposition. The Commissioner also noted in his order Respondents did\r\nnot learn about Williams' alleged urinary incontinence allegation until Williams'\r\nForm 50 was filed on January 6, 2010.\r\n\r\nAlthough the record references her urinary problems, the only medical evidence\r\nrelating to Williams' urinary problems are the doctors she saw independently, and\r\nWilliams testified she never reported any urinary problems to Dr. Poletti.\r\nTherefore, we find the substantial evidence in the record supports the Appellate\r\nPanel's finding Williams was not entitled to a claim for urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nIII.   Partial Paraplegia\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the Appellate Panel erred in denying her claim for partial\r\nparaplegia. We disagree.\r\n\r\nDuring a February 3, 2010 visit, Dr. Poletti determined Williams was qualified for\r\na diagnosis of incomplete paraplegia. Williams also independently saw Dr.\r\nFaaberg on March 3, 2010, and his notes state Williams \"requires gait assistance\r\nwith a walker\" and determined she qualifies for the criteria specified for\r\nincomplete paraplegia.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commissioner's order states Williams testified that contrary to Dr.\r\nFaaberg's report, she never told him she relied on a walker or a cane and that she\r\nhas not used a walker since the beginning of her claim. Additionally, Dr.\r\nZgleszewski's notes from her January 20, 2010 visit state Williams told him \"she\r\ndoes not use a cane, walker, or crutches.\" (Emphasis added.) He did not diagnose\r\nher with incomplete paraplegia. Further, Williams conceded that none of her\r\nauthorized doctors, Dr. Hartsock, Dr. Merrill, or Dr. Alexander, had ever\r\ndiagnosed her as suffering from incomplete paraplegia.

Mars Sapp (Sapp) to collect rent\r\nobligations, Will Wheeler (Wheeler) appeals from a $252,798 verdict against him,\r\narguing the trial court erred in denying his: (1) motion for a directed verdict on the\r\nclaim for future damages; (2) motion for a directed verdict based on the statute of\r\nlimitations; (3) request for a jury charge on the three-year statute of limitations for\r\n\na breach of contract action; (4) motion for a new trial; and (5) motion for a new\r\ntrial under the thirteenth juror doctrine. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn September 27, 1994, P.I. Leasing entered into a lease agreement with Sapp to\r\nrent a building in Surfside Beach, South Carolina.1 The lease was to expire on\r\nOctober 1, 2014. Wheeler, as president of P.I. Leasing, personally guaranteed\r\nperformance by P.I. Leasing of the lease obligations, including payment and rent.\r\nFrom October 1994 to June 1998, P.I. Leasing operated a video gambling\r\nestablishment on the leased premises; however, in June 1998, Wheeler sold the\r\nbusiness to Resort Properties South, Inc. (Resort Properties) and assigned the lease\r\nto it. Under the assignment, P.I. Leasing was liable for the rent obligations of\r\nResort Properties, and Wheeler again personally guaranteed performance of the\r\nlease terms. Sapp continued to receive rent checks from P.I. Leasing through\r\nFebruary 2001. Thereafter, several different entities continued to send monthly\r\nrental checks to Sapp, including: Save the Ocean Project, Inc.; Coastal Rescue\r\nMission; Ken Altman, II, LLC; and JDBD, LLC and Kenneth Altman, II. Sapp\r\ntestified every rent check from 1994 to September 2007 was signed by Wheeler,\r\nAltman, or Faircloth. Wheeler never provided Sapp with written notice he was\r\nrevoking his guaranty. By September 2007, P.I. Leasing had defaulted in its\r\npayments and was evicted in June 2008.2\r\n\r\nSapp filed a complaint on September 30, 2008, seeking accelerated rent and\r\ndamages, discounted by rent from the current tenant, in the amount of $556,099,\r\nplus attorney's fees and costs. In his answer, Wheeler asserted the lease agreement\r\nwas void for a mutual mistake because Sapp leased the premises to P.I. Leasing for\r\nthe purposes of operating a video gambling establishment; however, subsequent to\r\nthe execution of the lease, South Carolina outlawed video gambling and the\r\npurpose for which the lease was entered could not be performed. Therefore,\r\nWheeler claimed P.I. Leasing was excused from performing its duties under the\r\nterms of the lease due to legal impossibility. Wheeler also pleaded the following\r\nas defenses: the doctrine of estoppel, failure to mitigate, failure to state a claim for\r\n\r\n1 Wheeler was a majority owner of P.I. Leasing and Jarvis Faircloth was a\r\nminority owner. Ken Altman provided accounting services to P.I. Leasing and\r\nWheeler; served as the registered agent for P.I. Leasing; and collected rent from\r\nthe leased property's occupants.\r\n2 P.I. Leasing was dissolved with the Secretary of State's office on July 30, 2007.\r\n\nrelief, statute of limitations, the doctrine of laches, the doctrine of waiver, and the\r\nguaranty was void for lack of consideration. Further, Wheeler demanded a jury\r\ntrial. Sapp filed an amended complaint on October 6, 2009, alleging a cause of\r\naction against Wheeler for breach of contract.3\r\n\r\nA trial was held June 1-3, 2010. At the close of his case, Wheeler moved for a\r\ndirected verdict on Sapp's claim for future damages and asserted Sapp's claim was\r\nbarred by the three-year statute of limitations. At the close of testimony and after\r\ncounsels' closing arguments, the court denied both of Wheeler's motions for\r\ndirected verdict. The jury returned a $252,789 verdict for Sapp against Wheeler.\r\nThe court also awarded Sapp $48,929 in legal fees against Wheeler.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 2010, Wheeler filed a motion for new trial absolute, or in the\r\nalternative, a new trial nisi remittitur. Wheeler argued the verdict against him was\r\nfacially inconsistent with the $7,300 verdict against P.I. Leasing. Therefore, he\r\nasserted the court had to order a new trial absolute or in the alternative a new trial\r\nnisi remittitur to limit Wheeler's liability to the same liability as against P.I.\r\nLeasing. Wheeler also claimed the verdict was a product of confusion, passion,\r\nprejudice, partiality, corruption, or some other improper motive, and not supported\r\nby the evidence. Therefore, he requested the court grant a new trial under the\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine. Further, Wheeler alternatively sought an order remitting\r\nthe verdict to $7,300. Sapp objected to Wheeler's motion, asserting Wheeler\r\nwaived the ability to challenge the verdict by failing to make the objection prior to\r\ndismissal of the jury. The court denied Wheeler's motion, finding Wheeler failed\r\nto timely object. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nAn action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law. Silver\r\nv. Aabstract Pools & Spas, Inc., 376 S.C. 585, 590, 658 S.E.2d 539, 541-42 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2008). \"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the\r\njurisdiction of this [c]ourt extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a\r\nfactual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record\r\ndiscloses that there is no evidence which reasonably supports the jury's findings.\"\r\nTownes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n(1976).\r\n\r\n3Sapp also added two defendants: Kenneth Altman, the registered agent for P.I.\r\nLeasing, and JBDB, LLC, Altman's company; however, only Wheeler is appealing.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Directed Verdict Motions\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, this court views the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d\r\n881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002). A directed verdict motion is properly granted if the\r\nevidence as a whole is susceptible of only one reasonable inference. Id. In ruling\r\non a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or\r\nnon-existence of evidence. Id. This court will only reverse the trial court when no\r\nevidence supports the ruling below. Id.\r\n\r\nA.    Future Damages\r\n\r\nWheeler argues the court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the\r\nclaim for future damages because no evidence was presented that the reasonable\r\nrental value at the time of termination was less than the reserved rent under the\r\nlease. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Wheeler moved for a directed verdict, requesting the court strike Sapp's\r\nclaim for future damages. The court held the language in the lease between P.I.\r\nLeasing and Sapp was the binding method for determining future loss of rental\r\nincome following the termination of the lease. The lease Wheeler signed as a\r\nguaranty provides: \"If such rentals received from such re[-]letting during any\r\nmonth be less than those to be paid by [sic] during that month by Tenant\r\nhereunder, Tenant shall pay any such deficiency to Owner. Such deficiency shall\r\nbe calculated and paid monthly.\" It further provides Sapp can terminate the lease\r\nfor any breach and recover from the tenant\r\n\r\n             all damages [Sapp] may incur by reason of such breach,\r\n             including the cost of recovering the [l]eased premises,\r\n             reasonable attorney's fees, and, including the worth at the\r\n             time of such termination of the excess, if any, of the\r\n             amount of rent and charges equivalent to rent reserved in\r\n             this [l]ease for the remainder of the stated term over the\r\n             then reasonable rental value of the [l]eased [p]remises for\r\n             the remainder of the stated term, all of which amounts\r\n\n             shall be immediately due and payable from [t]enant to\r\n             [o]wner.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Wheeler argues Sapp failed to present any evidence he was entitled to\r\nfuture damages. Wheeler asserts that to be entitled to an award of future damages,\r\nSapp was required to present evidence that on August 13, 2008, the reserved rent\r\nper month under the lease of $6,618 was greater than the reasonable rental value of\r\nthe leased premises on the same date.\r\n\r\nAt the time the lease went into default, the monthly rent was $6,618. Once Sapp\r\nregained control of the property in Spring 2008, he was able to re-lease the\r\nproperty to several different tenants, and he presented evidence he netted\r\n$20,623.28 in income from the property from May 2008 to May 2010. Sapp\r\nasserts the rents he received are the reasonable rental value of the leased premises.\r\nHe maintained his total damages are $494,053. Therefore, Sapp argues the\r\nreasonable rental value at the time of the termination of the lease was a question of\r\nfact for the jury because the reasonable rental value of the leased premises was\r\nsubject to different interpretations. Further, the jury returned a verdict against\r\nWheeler for $252,798, or approximately 51% of the total damages Sapp sought;\r\nthus, the jury's verdict was within the range of damages presented. Because the\r\nevidence as a whole was susceptible of more than one reasonable inference as to\r\nthe reasonable rental value of the property, we find the court properly denied\r\nWheeler's motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nB.    Statute of Limitations\r\n\r\nWheeler argues the court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a directed verdict\r\nbecause Sapp failed to bring an action to enforce the guarantee against Wheeler\r\nwithin three years after P.I. Leasing ceased making rent payments. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA lease agreement is a contract and an action for breach of contract must be\r\nbrought within three years from the date the action accrues. S.C. Code Ann. § 15-\r\n3-530(1) (2005). Therefore, at trial, Wheeler moved for a directed verdict,\r\nasserting Sapp's claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Wheeler\r\nclaimed Sapp was required to bring his action within three years of the date P.I.\r\nLeasing stopped making its payments, which was in 2001. The court responded:\r\n\r\n             [T]he statute of limitations doesn't begin to run until . . .\r\n             Sapp . . . knew or in the exercise of ordinary and\r\n\n             reasonable diligence should have known that he had a\r\n             right of cause of action against another entity. In this\r\n             case[,] he was being paid and the checks were coming\r\n             from everybody and everywhere and every entity that\r\n             was out there. . . . He did not have any reason to believe\r\n             that he had a cause of action against [Wheeler] until the\r\n             payments quit coming from anybody, and it's my\r\n             understanding that suit was filed thereafter within the\r\n             statute of limitations. So, I must respectfully deny your\r\n             motion for a directed verdict on the statute of limitations\r\n             issue.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Wheeler asserts he only guaranteed the performance of two entities, P.I.\r\nLeasing and Resort Properties, and neither of these entities made payments to Sapp\r\nafter February 2001. Further, Wheeler argues Sapp did not provide any evidence\r\nof a written communication between Sapp and Wheeler in which either party\r\nconsented or communicated that third parties, other than P.I. Leasing, Resort\r\nProperties, or Wheeler, would make payments under the lease on behalf of the\r\nidentified tenants and guarantors under the lease. Therefore, Wheeler maintains\r\nSapp's cause of action to enforce the guaranty accrued in 2001 and was barred by\r\nthe statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nSapp received the last lease payment in January 2008, and he filed the suit on\r\nSeptember 30, 2008; therefore, Sapp brought the action to enforce the guaranty\r\nagainst Wheeler within a year after the default on the lease payments. Sapp\r\nentered into the lease with P.I. Leasing in 1994, and the lease was assigned to\r\nResort Properties in 1998. No other assignments or substitutions of tenants\r\noccurred, and Sapp received rent payments for the amounts required by the lease\r\nfrom 1994 until September 2007. Further, Sapp testified Wheeler, Altman, or\r\nFaircloth signed every check he received, and they were all involved at the\r\ninception of the lease in 1994. We find no error in the trial court's determination\r\nthat Sapp had no reason to believe he had a cause of action against Wheeler until\r\nthe rental payments ceased, and therefore, Sapp filed his action within the statute\r\nof limitations. Thus, the court properly denied Wheeler's motion for a directed\r\nverdict on the statute of limitations issue.\r\n\nII.   Jury Charge\r\n\r\nWheeler argues the court erred in denying his request for a jury charge on the\r\nthree-year statute of limitations for a breach of contract action. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe trial court need only charge the current and correct law of South Carolina.\r\nMagnolia N. Prop. Owners' Ass'n, Inc. v. Heritage Cmtys., Inc., 397 S.C. 348, 362,\r\n725 S.E.2d 112, 120 (Ct. App. 2012). \"In reviewing an alleged error in jury\r\ninstructions, we are mindful that an appellate court will not reverse the [trial]\r\ncourt's decision absent an abuse of discretion.\" Hennes v. Shaw, 397 S.C. 391,\r\n402, 725 S.E.2d 501, 507 (Ct. App. 2012). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when\r\nthe trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or is not supported by the\r\nevidence.\" Cole v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008). In our\r\nreview, this court must consider the trial court's jury charge as a whole in light of\r\nthe evidence and issues presented at trial. Hennes, 397 S.C. at 402, 725 S.E.2d at\r\n507. \"A trial court's refusal to give a properly requested charge is reversible error\r\nonly when the requesting party can demonstrate prejudice from the refusal.\"\r\nPittman v. Stevens, 364 S.C. 337, 340, 613 S.E.2d 378, 380 (2005).\r\n\r\nAt trial, Sapp asked the court: \"[A]re you going to charge statute of limitations as a\r\ndefense in the case?\" The court responded: \"No.\" Sapp replied: \"Okay.\" The\r\ncourt then stated:\r\n\r\n             I don't think it's a factual issue. I don't think in this\r\n             particular case that Mr. Sapp had any reason to expect, as\r\n             I've indicated earlier, that he had a cause of action against\r\n             Mr. Wheeler until the payments stopped coming in.\r\n\r\nWheeler did not object to the court's ruling that it was not going to charge the\r\nstatute of limitations, and he did not object after the jury was charged. Sapp\r\nargued in his response to Wheeler's motion for a new trial that Wheeler waived his\r\nright to object to the jury charge by failing to object before the jury was\r\ndischarged. On appeal, Wheeler argues the trial court erred by refusing to charge\r\nthe jury on the applicable three-year statute of limitations because the evidence\r\nconflicted as to the date the cause of action accrued.\r\n\r\nWe find Wheeler has not demonstrated he was prejudiced by the court's decision\r\nnot to charge the statute of limitations because Sapp presented evidence he was\r\nreceiving checks until September 2007 for the correct amount of rent that Wheeler,\r\n\nAltman, or Faircloth signed, and Sapp filed this action within one year of the\r\ndefault. Further, Wheeler never gave Sapp written notice he was terminating the\r\nlease, and Sapp never consented to assignments of the lease. The court found any\r\nleases for which Sapp did not give his consent were legally void and did not impact\r\nWheeler's guaranty. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying Wheeler's\r\nrequest for a jury charge on the three-year statute of limitations for a breach of\r\ncontract action.\r\n\r\nIII.   Motion for New Trial\r\n\r\nWheeler argues the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the\r\nverdict was irreconcilably inconsistent and excessive. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"In South Carolina, an appellate court must uphold a jury verdict if it is possible to\r\nreconcile its various features.\" Camden v. Hilton, 360 S.C. 164, 174, 600 S.E.2d\r\n88, 93 (Ct. App. 2004). \"Furthermore, 'a jury verdict should be upheld when it is\r\npossible to do so and carry into effect the jury's clear intention.'\" Id. (quoting\r\nJohnson v. Parker, 279 S.C. 132, 135, 303 S.E.2d 95, 97 (1983)). \"When the jury's\r\nverdict is inadequate or excessive, the trial [court] has the discretionary power to\r\ngrant a new trial nisi.\" Waring v. Johnson, 341 S.C. 248, 256, 533 S.E.2d 906, 910\r\n(Ct. App. 2000). \"Compelling reasons, however, must be given to justify invading\r\nthe jury's province in this manner.\" Id. \"The grant or denial of a motion for a new\r\ntrial nisi rests within the discretion of the trial [court] and [its] decision will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal unless [its] findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or\r\nthe conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.\" Id. \"This [c]ourt has the\r\nduty to review the record and determine whether there has been an abuse of\r\ndiscretion amounting to an error of law.\" Id. at 257, 533 S.E.2d at 911.\r\n\r\nIn his motion for new trial absolute, or in the alternative, a new trial nisi remittitur,\r\nWheeler argued the verdict against him was facially inconsistent with the $7,300\r\nverdict against P.I. Leasing. Therefore, he asserted the court had to order a new\r\ntrial absolute or in the alternative a new trial nisi remittitur to limit Wheeler's\r\nliability to the same liability as previously decided against P.I. Leasing. The court\r\ndenied Wheeler's motion, finding Wheeler did not object to the jury's verdict until\r\nthe jury was discharged. Thus, the court determined he failed to timely object, and\r\nthe issue was waived.\r\n\r\nWe find the verdicts were not inconsistent. P.I. Leasing assigned its interest in the\r\n1994 lease to Resort Properties in 1998; made its last payment under the lease in\r\n\n2001; and was dissolved as a company in 2007. Wheeler also signed as a guaranty\r\nunder the assignment of the lease to Resort Properties and was still the guaranty for\r\nthe lease until the lease was breached in 2007. Therefore, the jury could\r\nreasonably award Sapp fewer damages against P.I. Leasing than for Wheeler.\r\nAdditionally, the jury's finding that P.I. Leasing breached its lease agreement and\r\nWheeler breached his guaranty agreement was not ambiguous or inconsistent\r\nbecause the jury awarded Sapp actual damages against both P.I. Leasing and\r\nWheeler, and did not award punitive damages against either. Therefore, we find\r\nthe evidence supports the trial court's denial of Wheeler's motion for a new trial\r\nbecause the verdict was not irreconcilably inconsistent or excessive.\r\n\r\nIV.   Thirteenth Juror Doctrine\r\n\r\nWheeler argues the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial under the\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine because the verdict was inconsistent, reflected jury\r\nconfusion, and was excessive.\r\n\r\n\"Under the 'thirteenth juror' doctrine, a trial [court] may grant a new trial absolute\r\nwhen [it] finds the evidence does not justify the verdict.\" Vinson v. Hartley, 324\r\nS.C. 389, 402, 477 S.E.2d 715, 722 (Ct. App. 1996). The trial court has the\r\nauthority to grant a new trial upon its finding that justice has not prevailed or if the\r\nverdict is inconsistent and reflects the jury's confusion. Id. at 404, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n722. \"A trial [court]'s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will not\r\nbe disturbed unless [its] decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the\r\nconclusion reached was controlled by an error of law.\" Id. at 403, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n722.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, we find the verdict was not inconsistent or excessive; therefore,\r\nwe also find the court did not err in denying Wheeler's motion for a new trial under\r\nthe thirteenth juror doctrine.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5090","title":"Independence National Bank v.

Appellants also appeal the\r\nMaster's additional finding that pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation,\r\nIndependence was entitled to a first and superior mortgage. We reverse.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nBuncombe obtained a commercial loan in the amount of $1.65 million from\r\nIndependence, of which DeCarlis was an individual guarantor. This loan was\r\nsecured by approximately 4.9 acres of land in Greenville County (Greenville\r\nproperty). Buncombe and DeCarlis retained attorney Tommy Dugas to handle the\r\nloan closing. Independence's loan was to satisfy a first mortgage on the Greenville\r\nproperty held by First National Bank of Spartanburg (First National). After\r\nreceiving information from Independence regarding the details of the loan, Dugas\r\nconducted an examination of the Greenville property's title. As part of that\r\nexamination, Dugas determined the Greenville property was encumbered by two\r\nmortgages of record, the one held by First National and a second mortgage held by\r\nDeCarlis individually.\r\n\r\nAt the closing, Robert M. Lowery was present on behalf of Independence, and\r\nDeCarlis was present on behalf of Buncombe and individually as a guarantor of the\r\nnote. DeCarlis individually guaranteed the commercial promissory note, and a\r\nseparate guaranty agreement was executed as well. Buncombe and Independence\r\nexecuted a loan commitment letter that stated Independence would make the\r\nrequested loan to Buncombe under certain terms and conditions, one being that\r\nBuncombe would grant a first in priority real estate mortgage in the Greenville\r\nproperty to Independence. Specifically, one of the requirements within the\r\nconditions precedent section of the loan commitment letter stated,\r\n\r\n            A commitment to issue a standard ALTA mortgagee title\r\n            insurance policy in form, content and from a title insurer\r\n            satisfactory to Independence, insuring the mortgage as a\r\n            first lien on the Property for the full amount of the loan,\r\n            with such endorsements as Independence may require.\r\n            Title shall be fee simple and marketable, free and clear of\r\n            all defects, liens and encumbrances, including mechanics'\r\n            liens.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). DeCarlis signed the loan commitment letter, dated September\r\n25, 2007, as a guarantor and on behalf of Buncombe. Moreover, the mortgage\r\nincluded the following language: \"The words \"Related Documents\" mean . . . any .\r\n. . documents or agreements executed in connection with this Security Instrument\r\nwhether now or hereafter existing. The Related Documents are hereby made a part\r\nof this Security Instrument by reference thereto, with the same force and effect as\r\n\nif fully set forth herein.\" Dugas was the only attorney at the closing, representing\r\nall parties. DeCarlis, on behalf of Buncombe and individually, further signed a\r\nbusiness loan agreement stating that any additional documents necessary to make\r\nthe terms of the loan conform to the conditions contained in the lender's\r\ncommitment would be executed accordingly. The commercial real estate mortgage\r\nissued to Buncombe contained similar language.\r\n\r\nDeCarlis did not subordinate his previously recorded mortgage to that of\r\nIndependence's mortgage, nor was his mortgage satisfied or released during the\r\nclosing. Lowery testified that while Dugas reviewed the lender's commitment\r\nletter with DeCarlis, DeCarlis never revealed the existence of his mortgage on the\r\nGreenville property. Independence's mortgage was recorded in the Greenville\r\nCounty Register of Deeds (ROD) on September 26, 2007, at Book 4855, Page 978.\r\nThe mortgage to DeCarlis remained open and of record.\r\n\r\nThe maturity date for Independence's loan was originally March, 25, 2009.\r\nHowever, through a change in terms agreement, the date was extended to March\r\n25, 2010. The loan was not paid off by the maturity date, and Independence\r\nsought to foreclose on their mortgage. Independence then discovered that\r\nDeCarlis's loan was still open and of record. Dugas contacted Buncombe and\r\nDeCarlis regarding the issue and requested that DeCarlis sign a subordination\r\nagreement. DeCarlis declined to execute the agreement.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 2010, Independence filed a foreclosure complaint against Appellants.\r\nOn June 18, 2010, Appellants filed an answer and counterclaim challenging the\r\npriority of Independence's mortgage. On October 14, 2010, the court denied a\r\nmotion for summary judgment by Independence. Thereafter, on March 24, 2011,\r\nIndependence filed a motion to amend its complaint, which was granted over\r\nAppellants' objection. The amended complaint included a new cause of action for\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\nDugas testified at the hearing on April 29, 2011, and stated he had been aware of\r\nDeCarlis's mortgage on the Greenville property and had written himself a note that\r\nDeCarlis's mortgage needed to be released. Dugas admitted he made a mistake in\r\nfailing to have DeCarlis execute a satisfaction, release, or subordination of\r\nDeCarlis's mortgage at the loan closing and stated the parties agreed Independence\r\nwould have a first mortgage. However, when he tried to correct the mistake a\r\ncouple of years later, DeCarlis replied through his attorney, refusing to sign a\r\nsubordination agreement. He stated he did \"not have any independent recollection\r\n\nthat the loan was contingent on [his] subordinating his individual mortgage to\r\nIndependence National Bank.\" A manager from Independence's loan department\r\ntestified that Independence would not loan $1.65 million as a second mortgage and\r\nhad DeCarlis's mortgage been revealed to him, he would have refused to issue the\r\nloan.\r\n\r\nFollowing the hearing, in which DeCarlis failed to appear and did not put forth any\r\nevidence, the Master entered an order of foreclosure prepared by Independence.\r\nSubsequently, Appellants filed a motion to reconsider, and Independence filed a\r\nmotion to alter or amend the order to include a ruling on equitable subrogation.\r\nAppellants objected to altering the order on the grounds that equitable subrogation\r\nwas not pled by Independence. The Master denied Appellants' motion, but granted\r\nIndependence's motion and found it met the requirements for equitable subrogation\r\nas well. Appellants then timely filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nDid the Master err by failing to give priority to DeCarlis's mortgage when it was\r\nfiled prior to Independence's mortgage?\r\n\r\nDid the Master err in reforming Independence's mortgage?\r\n\r\nDid the Master err in amending his original order to provide for equitable\r\nsubrogation?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"An action to establish lien priorities is an action in equity,\" SunTrust Bank v.\r\nBryant, 392 S.C. 264, 267, 708 S.E.2d 821, 822 (Ct.

Dozier Assocs., Inc., 285 S.C. 358, 360, 329\r\nS.E.2d 437, 438 (1985). \"The appellate court's standard of review in equitable\r\nmatters is our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" SunTrust Bank,\r\n392 S.C. at 267, 708 S.E.2d at 822-23 (citing Williams v. Wilson, 349 S.C. 336,\r\n339-40, 563 S.E.2d 320, 322 (2002)).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAppellants first argue the Master erred in giving priority to Independence's\r\nmortgage because it is clear that DeCarlis's mortgage was filed first in time, and\r\ntherefore is superior.\r\n\r\nSection 30-7-10 of the South Carolina Code (2007) provides:\r\n\r\n             All . . . mortgages or instruments in writing in the nature\r\n             of a mortgage of any real property, . . . all assignments,\r\n             satisfactions, releases, and contracts in the nature of\r\n             subordinations, . . . or other liens on real property created\r\n             by law or by agreement of the parties and generally all\r\n             instruments in writing conveying an interest in real estate\r\n             required by law to be recorded in the office of the register\r\n             of deeds or clerk of court in those counties where the\r\n             office of the register of deeds has been abolished or in the\r\n             office of the Secretary of State delivered or executed\r\n             after July 31, 1934, except as otherwise provided by\r\n             statute, are valid so as to affect the rights of subsequent\r\n             creditors (whether lien creditors or simple contract\r\n             creditors), or purchasers for valuable consideration\r\n             without notice, only from the day and hour when they are\r\n             recorded in the office of the register of deeds or clerk of\r\n             court of the county in which the real property affected is\r\n             situated. In the case of a subsequent purchaser of real\r\n             estate, or in the case of a subsequent lien creditor on real\r\n             estate for valuable consideration without notice, the\r\n             instrument evidencing the subsequent conveyance or\r\n             subsequent lien must be filed for record in order for its\r\n             holder to claim under this section as a subsequent\r\n             creditor or purchaser for value without notice, and the\r\n             priority is determined by the time of filing for record.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). We agree that section 30-7-10, read without reference to any\r\nother doctrine or statute, indicates DeCarlis's lien is superior to Independence's\r\nlien. However, we examine whether the Master was correct in finding\r\nIndependence had the superior lien pursuant to reformation of the mortgage and/or\r\nthe doctrine of equitable subrogation.\r\n\nReformation\r\n\r\nAppellants maintain the Master's reformation of the mortgage was error because\r\nIndependence did not prove by clear and convincing evidence a \"meeting of the\r\nminds.\" We agree.\r\n\r\n\"'A contract may be reformed on the ground of mistake when the mistake is mutual\r\nand consists in the omission or insertion of some material element affecting the\r\nsubject matter or the terms and stipulations of the contract, inconsistent with those\r\nof the parol agreement which necessarily preceded it.'\" George v. Empire Fire &\r\nMarine Ins. Co., 344 S.C. 582, 590, 545 S.E.2d 500, 504 (2001) (quoting Crosby v.\r\nProtective Life Ins. Co., 293 S.C. 203, 206, 359 S.E.2d 298, 300 (Ct. App. 1987)).\r\n\"'A mistake is mutual where both parties intended a certain thing and by mistake in\r\nthe drafting did not obtain what was intended.'\" Id. (quoting Crosby, 293 S.C. at\r\n206, 359 S.E.2d at 300). \"'Reformation is the remedy by which writings are\r\nrectified to conform to the actual agreement of the parties.'\" Crosby, 293 S.C. at\r\n206, 359 S.E.2d at 300 (quoting Crewe v. Blackmon, 289 S.C. 229, 234, 345\r\nS.E.2d 754, 757 (Ct. App. 1986)). \"Before equity will reform a contract, the\r\nexistence of a mutual mistake must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.\"\r\nId. (citing Crosby, 293 S.C. at 206, 359 S.E.2d at 300).\r\n\r\nThe Master can reform a material element affecting subject matter or the terms and\r\nstipulations of the contract. In the present case, the error was failing to have\r\nDeCarlis sign a subrogation agreement. DeCarlis was not a party to the mortgage\r\nand reformation does not permit a court to write a new, additional party into the\r\nmortgage to correct the error. See 66 Am. Jur. 2d Reformation of Instruments § 51\r\n(2011) (\"A court of equity may not add or substitute other parties for those\r\nappearing on the face of a contract where the effect may be to make a new\r\ncontract.\"). Thus, we find the Master erred in reforming the mortgage to alter the\r\nparties' priority rights.\r\n\r\nEquitable Subrogation\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the Master erred in altering his final order to include findings\r\nregarding the concept of equitable subrogation because relief for the same was\r\nnever pled by Independence. Alternatively, Appellants argue even if the Master\r\nwas correct in allowing Independence to allege a claim of equitable subrogation, he\r\nerred in determining it was an appropriate remedy when Independence failed to\r\n\nestablish any of the essential elements. We find their first argument to be without\r\nmerit, but agree with their second argument.\r\n\r\nIn its amended complaint, Independence contended that DeCarlis's mortgage\r\nshould be ruled junior and secondary to Independence's mortgage pursuant to the\r\ntheory of equitable subrogation. In their amended answer, Appellants responded\r\nthat because Independence does not hold a first priority lien and was aware it did\r\nnot hold a first priority lien, its allegations in Paragraph 13, which included the\r\nequitable subrogation claim, were \"completely improper.\" Appellants' direct\r\nresponse to Independence's claim of equitable subrogation indicates they had\r\nnotice of the claim, and further, had time to prepare any defense or argument they\r\nmay have had against the claim. We believe it was appropriate to amend the final\r\norder to include findings on the claim of equitable subrogation, and Appellants\r\nwere not prejudiced by the Master's decision.\r\n\r\nContinuing to the merits, equitable subrogation allows a subsequent creditor to\r\nassume the rights and priority of a prior creditor. To be granted the remedy of\r\nequitable subrogation, the mortgagee must establish the following requirements:\r\n(1) the party claiming subrogation has paid the debt; (2) the party was not a\r\nvolunteer but had a direct interest in the discharge of the debt or lien; (3) the party\r\nwas secondarily liable for the debt or for the discharge of the lien; and (4) no\r\ninjustice will be done to the other party by the allowance of the equity. Dedes v.\r\nStrickland, 307 S.C. 155, 158, 414 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1992). \"Additionally, the\r\nparty asserting the doctrine must not have had actual notice of the prior mortgage.\"\r\nId. In considering this doctrine, it is important to note that constructive notice is\r\nnot a bar. Pee Dee State Bank v. Prosser, 295 S.C. 229, 238, 367 S.E.2d 708, 713\r\n(1988), overruled on other grounds by United Carolina Bank v. Caroprop, Ltd.,\r\n316 S.C. 1, 446 S.E.2d 415 (1994).\r\n\r\nIndependence, the party claiming subrogation, paid Buncombe's debt to First\r\nNational by satisfying First National's mortgage on the Greenville property.\r\nIndependence loaned Buncombe $1.65 million secured with a mortgage on the\r\nGreenville property, in part to satisfy First National's mortgage, and thus, was not a\r\nvolunteer. Regarding the third requirement, Independence was secondarily liable\r\nfor the discharge of First National's mortgage under the instruments creating the\r\nnew mortgage. As to the fourth requirement, we also do not believe an injustice\r\nwould be done to DeCarlis, because it appears from the record he was aware\r\nIndependence expected a first mortgage, and he would be placed in the same\r\nposition he would have been if the closing had gone as intended by the parties.\r\n\nHowever, we find Independence had actual notice of the prior mortgage. See\r\nSpence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 118, 628 S.E.2d 869, 875 (2006) (\"[I]n the context\r\nof a real estate transaction, a purchaser of real property has actual notice of a title\r\ndefect or other claim, lien, or interest adverse to his own in a particular property\r\nwhen he actually knows about the defect or claim, or when a reasonable person, if\r\nmade aware of the same information known to the buyer, would be charged with\r\nactual notice of the defect or claim. Actual notice may consist of facts or\r\nconditions observed by a prospective purchaser as well as information conveyed\r\norally or in writing to him.\"). While the record does not contain evidence that\r\nIndependence was directly informed about the existence of DeCarlis's lien, we\r\nbelieve there was an agent-principal relationship between Dugas and\r\nIndependence, such that actual notice to Dugas was actual notice to Independence.\r\nSee Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Prioleau, 359 S.C. 238, 242, 597 S.E.2d 165, 168\r\n(Ct. App. 2004) (\"[T]he relationship of agency need not depend upon express\r\nappointment and acceptance thereof. Rather, an agency relationship may be, and\r\nfrequently is, implied or inferred from the words and conduct of the parties and the\r\ncircumstances of the particular case.\"); see also Citizens' Bank v. Heyward, 135\r\nS.C. 190, 199, 133 S.E. 709, 712 (1925) (stating notice to agent is notice to\r\nprincipal); compare Pee Dee State Bank, 295 S.C. at 238, 367 S.E.2d at 713-14\r\n(finding no evidence in the record of any information the closing attorney had\r\nregarding other liens on the property; thus, equitable subrogation was not barred).\r\n\r\nIndependence now claims no evidence established Dugas was its agent. However,\r\nDugas was the only attorney present at the closing, and he was the only one\r\nauthorized to conduct the closing. Independence admits in its brief Dugas\r\nrepresented both parties with regard to the closing. Despite the fact Buncombe and\r\nDeCarlis paid for Dugas's services, Independence required them to do so in the\r\n\"Costs\" section of its loan commitment letter, stating \"[o]n or before the closing\r\nBorrower shall pay all costs, expenses and fees (including, without limitation, any\r\nappraisal, survey, insurance, environmental assessment, engineering, inspections,\r\nsearches, recording and attorneys' fees) associated with this transaction.\" Dugas\r\nconducted a title search before the closing and discovered DeCarlis's lien. He\r\nadmitted he knew of DeCarlis's mortgage at the closing, yet failed to subordinate\r\nthe mortgage to Independence's mortgage. Thus, we find Independence had actual\r\nknowledge of DeCarlis's mortgage. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the\r\nMaster's ruling that equitable subrogation was a proper remedy under these facts.\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold neither reformation nor equitable subrogation were appropriate remedies\r\nunder these facts. Accordingly, the Master's rulings are\r\n\r\nREVERSED. \n\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5091","title":"Burgess v.

The State argues the PCR court erred in failing to\r\ndetermine whether Burgess was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to request a jury\r\ncharge regarding Burgess's absence from his criminal trial. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Burgess proceeded to trial on charges of distribution of marijuana and\r\ndistribution of marijuana within proximity of a school. After jury selection,\r\nBurgess was permitted to remain free on bond and when he did not return\r\nfollowing a brief recess, he was tried in absentia. During closing arguments, the\r\nState did not mention Burgess's absence. However, Burgess's counsel did, stating\r\nas follows:   Of course, [Burgess] doesn't have to present anything.\r\n              The State has the burden of proof. He is innocent. He\r\n              doesn't have to testify. He doesn't have to present any\r\n              evidence at all. As a matter of fact, he was here\r\n              yesterday, whatever. He was having a trial. Obviously,\r\n              he's telling you I didn't do this or whatever. That's his\r\n              position on this. And the State has got to prove to you\r\n              that he did do this. If he were here, he wouldn't have to\r\n              get up there and testify or do anything. He didn't have to\r\n              present any evidence. The State has to do that.\r\n\r\nAfter closing arguments, the circuit court charged the jury. The circuit court\r\ninstructed the jury on the State's burden of proof and explained that Burgess was\r\nnot required to testify in his own defense nor could the jury infer or draw\r\nconclusions from the fact that he did not testify. However, the circuit court did not\r\nexplicitly inform the jury that, pursuant to State v. Jackson,1 they could not\r\nconstrue Burgess's absence as an admission of guilt. Burgess's trial counsel did not\r\nobject or request any additional charges. During deliberations, the jury asked two\r\nfactual questions but made no inquiry concerning Burgess's absence. The jury\r\nconvicted Burgess on both counts and the circuit court's sentence was sealed.\r\n\r\nAlmost three years later, Burgess was found, arrested, and brought before the\r\ncircuit court for sentencing. Burgess was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for\r\ndistribution within proximity and fifteen years' imprisonment for distribution, third\r\noffense. Burgess did not file a direct appeal.\r\n\r\n1   301 S.C. 49, 389 S.E.2d 654 (1990).\r\n\nBurgess filed an application for PCR, arguing, inter alia, that his trial counsel erred\r\nin failing to request a Jackson charge. At the PCR hearing, Burgess's trial counsel\r\ntestified he did not recall requesting a Jackson charge but stated he did not think it\r\nwas important because the \"bell [had] rung.\" Additionally, trial counsel explained\r\nhe felt he did an adequate job explaining and emphasizing reasonable doubt and\r\nBurgess's right to remain silent during closing arguments. According to trial\r\ncounsel, he believed no further instructions were necessary because \"if we are\r\nhaving this trial, obviously he's telling you he didn't do this.\" The PCR court\r\ngranted Burgess a new trial based on its finding that Burgess's counsel was\r\nineffective in failing to request a Jackson charge. Specifically, the PCR court ruled\r\nas follows:  The Applicant was convicted of the charges in absentia\r\n             and in accordance with . . . State v. Jackson, 301 S.C. 49,\r\n             the trial attorney failed to object to the jury's instructions\r\n             which did not include language regarding the\r\n             Applicant'[s] absence from this trial and whether or not\r\n             his absence could be held against him with respect to\r\n             delivering a verdict in this matter and as such his case\r\n             should be remanded for a new trial in the General\r\n             Sessions Court.\r\n\r\nThe State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, and this court granted the petition.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the PCR court erred in finding trial counsel was ineffective in\r\nfailing to request a Jackson charge. Specifically, the State maintains the PCR court\r\nfailed to undertake an analysis of whether Burgess was prejudiced and, had the\r\nPCR court done so, Burgess failed to meet his burden. We hold that the State's\r\nargument is not preserved for appellate review because the State failed to file a\r\nRule 59(e), SCRCP, motion asking the PCR court to specifically determine\r\nwhether Burgess suffered prejudice as the result of his trial counsel's deficient\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nIn Marlar v. State, 375 S.C. 407, 653 S.E.2d 266 (2007), the PCR court disposed\r\nof several of the applicant's allegations as follows:\r\n\r\n             As to any allegations raised in the application or at the\r\n             hearing not specifically addressed by this Order, this\r\n             Court finds that the applicant failed to present any\r\n\n            evidence regarding such allegations. Accordingly, this\r\n            Court finds that the applicant failed to meet his burden of\r\n            proof regarding them. Therefore, any and all allegations\r\n            not specifically addressed in this Order are hereby denied\r\n            and dismissed.\r\n\r\nId. at 409, 653 S.E.2d at 266. Our supreme court held that this paragraph did not\r\nconstitute a \"sufficient ruling on any issues since it does not set forth specific\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\" Id. Accordingly, the supreme court\r\nfound that this court erred in addressing the merits of Marlar's PCR application.\r\nId. at 410, 653 S.E.2d at 267. The supreme court emphasized that to properly\r\npreserve an issue for appellate review, it is incumbent upon a party in a PCR action\r\nto file a Rule 59(e) motion in the event the PCR court fails to make specific\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law regarding an issue. Id.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the PCR court's ruling contains greater detail than that in\r\nMarlar but is nevertheless lacking sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw. Among other things, the PCR court failed to address whether Burgess\r\nsuffered any prejudice as the result of his counsel's deficient performance.\r\nBecause the State failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion asking the PCR court to make\r\nspecific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the prejudice prong, we\r\nfind the issue on appeal is not preserved for our review. Accordingly, we affirm\r\nthe PCR court's order.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5092","title":"Vail v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy\r\nAttorney General Salley Elliott, Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral Matthew Frideman, and Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral Ashleigh Rayanna Wilson, of Columbia, for\r\nRespondent.\r\n\nLOCKEMY, J.: In this appeal from the denial of his post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\napplication, Mark E. Vail argues the PCR court erred in finding trial counsel was\r\nnot ineffective for failing to object to alleged hearsay testimony. We reverse and\r\ngrant Vail a new trial.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThis case involved allegations from a thirteen-year-old girl (Victim), who claimed\r\nshe and Vail, a teacher and coach at her First Baptist Church School (First Baptist),\r\nwere having a sexual relationship. At trial, the State called several witnesses,\r\nincluding Kelsey R. (Sister) and John R. (Father), to testify regarding Victim's\r\nstatements. Portions of witnesses' testimonies went into detail about the alleged\r\nsexual encounters and the resulting actions that were taken. At least two witnesses,\r\nSister and Caroline O., testified Victim recanted her story soon after her confession\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nTrial counsel did not object to the testimonies now alleged to be inadmissible\r\nhearsay, did not request limiting instructions, and did not move to exclude any of\r\nthe statements pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE. The jury convicted Vail on the\r\ncharges of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor and lewd\r\nact with a minor. He received a ten-year sentence and an eight-year sentence, to be\r\nserved concurrently. The jury acquitted him of two other counts of CSC with a\r\nminor. Vail filed a timely notice of appeal but later withdrew it. Subsequently,\r\nVail sought PCR claiming trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by\r\nfailing to object to many instances of inadmissible hearsay. An evidentiary hearing\r\nwas held on January 23, 2008.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, trial counsel explained his trial strategy was to use alibi\r\nwitnesses for all the alleged instances of sexual intercourse except for one on\r\nNovember 4, 2003. While trial counsel admitted the November 4, 2003 incident\r\npresented a problem because Vail had no way of refuting it through an alibi\r\nwitness, he hoped his attacks on the other instances would undermine the Victim's\r\ncredibility. Trial counsel stated he had a \"huge mountain to overcome\" when the\r\njury was presented with evidence of thirty hours of telephone calls between Vail\r\nand Victim, many of which were late at night. He maintained he did not object to\r\nall instances of hearsay because he wanted to be \"transparent\" with the jury and\r\navoid appearing as if he was playing \"hide the ball,\" because credibility was crucial\r\nin this case. He explained he failed to object to further hearsay from other\r\nwitnesses because he had to elicit Victim's recantations through them as well.\r\nHowever, he admitted that even without the recantations and collateral attacks on\r\n\nVictim's credibility, he had various other credibility issues he could have pursued\r\nas well. He testified that another trial strategy was creating a picture that Victim\r\nhad a teenage obsession with Vail. Trial counsel believed allowing the jury to hear\r\nthrough other witnesses the constant altering of Victim's story contributed to that\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to\r\nhearsay. To support its finding, the PCR court determined the majority of\r\nstatements alleged by Vail to be hearsay did not fall under the definition of\r\nhearsay, or in the alternative, fell under various exceptions to the rule against\r\nhearsay. After the denial of PCR relief, Vail filed a petition for writ of certiorari,\r\nwhich this court granted on August 16, 2011.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"For [a] petitioner to be granted PCR as a result of ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel, he [has the burden to prove] both: (1) that his counsel failed to render\r\nreasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms, and (2) that he\r\nwas prejudiced by his counsel's ineffective assistance.\" Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C.\r\n151, 155-56, 551 S.E.2d 260, 262 (2001) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\nU.S. 668 (1984); Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000)).\r\n\r\n\"'An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting\r\naside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the\r\njudgment.'\" Smith v. State, 386 S.C. 562, 565, 689 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2010)\r\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691). \"To establish prejudice, the defendant is\r\nrequired 'to show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\r\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\r\noutcome.'\" Id. at 565-66, 689 S.E.2d at 631 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).\r\n\"Moreover, no prejudice occurs, despite trial counsel's deficient performance,\r\nwhere there is otherwise overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.\" Id. at\r\n566, 689 S.E.2d at 631 (citing Rosemond v. Catoe, 383 S.C. 320, 325, 680 S.E.2d\r\n5, 8 (2009)).\r\n\r\nUpon appellate review, this court \"will uphold the PCR court if any evidence of\r\nprobative value supports the decision.\" Id. at 565, 689 S.E.2d at 631 (citing Smith\r\nv. State, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006)).1\r\n\r\n1   Within this opinion, we reference two separate opinions both titled Smith v. State.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFailure to Object to Instances of Hearsay\r\nVail cited numerous instances in the record in which he claims trial counsel should\r\nhave objected on the basis of inadmissible hearsay testimony or irrelevance. He\r\nargues the PCR court erred in finding the challenged testimony fell under Rule\r\n801(d)(1), SCRE, was an exception to the rule against hearsay, or did not fit within\r\nthe definition of hearsay. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"'The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out-of-court\r\nstatement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule\r\napplies.'\" Watson v. State, 370 S.C. 68, 71, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006) (quoting\r\nDawkins, 346 S.C. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 262). However,\r\n\r\n             [i]n a CSC case, the testimony of a witness regarding the\r\n             Victim's out-of-court statement is not hearsay when:\r\n             \"The declarant testifies at the trial . . . and is subject to\r\n             cross-examination concerning the statement, and the\r\n             statement is . . . consistent with the declarant's testimony\r\n             in a criminal sexual conduct case or attempted criminal\r\n             sexual conduct case where the declarant is the alleged\r\n             Victim and the statement is limited to the time and place\r\n             of the incident.\"\r\n\r\nSmith, 386 S.C. at 566, 689 S.E.2d at 631-32 (quoting Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE).\r\n\"Any other details or particulars, including the perpetrator's identity, must be\r\nexcluded.\" Watson, 370 S.C. at 71-72, 634 S.E.2d at 644 (citing Dawkins, 346\r\nS.C. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 262-63).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE, provides a prior statement by a witness is\r\nnot hearsay  if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is\r\n             subject to cross-examination concerning the statement,\r\n             and the statement is consistent with the declarant's\r\n             testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied\r\n             charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or\r\n             improper influence or motive; provided, however, the\r\n\n             statement must have been made before the alleged\r\n             fabrication, or before the alleged improper influence or\r\n             motive arose . . . .\r\n\r\nIn other words, for a prior consistent statement to be admissible pursuant to Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B), the following elements must be present:\r\n\r\n             \"(1) the declarant must testify and be subject to cross-\r\n             examination, (2) the opposing party must have explicitly\r\n             or implicitly accused the declarant of recently fabricating\r\n             the statement or of acting under an improper influence or\r\n             motive, (3) the statement must be consistent with the\r\n             declarant's testimony, and (4) the statement must have\r\n             been made prior to the alleged fabrication, or prior to the\r\n             existence of the alleged improper influence or motive.\"\r\n\r\nState v. Winkler, 388 S.C. 574, 583, 698 S.E.2d 596, 601 (2010) (quoting State v.\r\nSaltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121-22, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001)).\r\n\r\nWe find portions of challenged testimony far exceeded the limitations provided in\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B) & (D). For example, Victim's father, John R. (Father), gave the\r\nfollowing statements during the State's direct examination:\r\n\r\n             A: Well, a lot of the admissions that came out, it didn't\r\n             just all come out in one big package for us. You know, a\r\n             lot of the details, especially, you know, the more intense\r\n             sexual details, she had a hard time telling me face to face.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n             A: I know that, at one time, it occurred in his apartment .\r\n             . . and that there was at least one time in his car while it\r\n             was in our neighborhood.\r\n\r\n             Q: Was she able to give you any details about when\r\n             these things had happened?\r\n\r\n             A: I know – I will be honest, a lot of those – the hard\r\n             details about the sexual intercourse and oral sex, I think\r\n\n             they were probably as hard for her to tell me as they were\r\n             for me to listen.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n             Q: What did she say?\r\n\r\n             A: Well, there was kind of a real poignant moment\r\n             where she said, daddy, he took everything, she [sic] took\r\n             everything I have.\r\n\r\n             Q: Did she took everything or he took everything?\r\n\r\n             A: He did, he took everything.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Sister testified Victim \"admitted to us that she and Coach Vail had\r\nbeen having sex. . . . She had told me originally that they had sex. But they had\r\nbeen talking, and they had both eventually started saying, you know, we just went\r\nto the pier on Folly Beach.\" In related testimony, Caroline O. stated Victim\r\n\r\n             talked to [Sister] and [Sister] was informed that [Victim]\r\n             and Mr. Vail had been having sex. . . . As soon as she\r\n             informed Kelsey that they had been having sex, . . .\r\n             [Victim] informed me that they had been having sex as\r\n             well. . . . I believe the three-minute call was when\r\n             [Victim] first informed Kelsey about the two of them\r\n             having sex . . . .\r\n\r\nThese statements from Sister, Caroline O., and Father were not confined to time\r\nand place, nor did they meet all the requirements necessary to satisfy Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B).\r\n\r\nFurther, other testimonies were offered for no other purpose but to prove the truth\r\nof the matter asserted, or were far more prejudicial than probative. Specifically,\r\nSister gave testimony that only served to prove Victim's story of a sexual\r\nrelationship between Vail and Victim. Moreover, Thomas Mullins, First Baptist's\r\nprincipal at the time of the incident, testified to \"a rumor or a statement that there\r\nwas some inappropriate behavior with [Vail] and another student,\" which was\r\nextremely prejudicial, with only minimal probative value.\r\n\nThe PCR court found testimonies provided by Caroline O. and Virginia Murray\r\nfell under the exception to the rule against hearsay established in Rule 803(3),\r\nSCRE, which provides,\r\n\r\n             A statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind,\r\n             emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent,\r\n             plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily\r\n             health), but not including a statement of memory or\r\n             belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it\r\n             relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or\r\n             terms of declarant's will.\r\n\r\nCaroline O. testified Victim told her \"[Vail] was mad at her for telling us and\r\nsomehow he found out that she had told us they had sex.\" Murray testified Victim\r\nwas very upset Vail had left First Baptist, and Victim stated \"it was because of her\r\nand everybody would hate her because of it. . . . And then she went on to say that\r\nshe had given her virginity to him and that's why she was really upset.\" We find\r\nneither of the statements by Caroline O. or Virginia Murray fit within the\r\nexception provided in Rule 803(3). See State v. Tennant, 394 S.C. 5, 16, 714\r\nS.E.2d 297, 303 (2011) (\"'If the reservation in the text of [Rule 803(3)] is to have\r\nany effect, it must be understood to narrowly limit those admissible statements to\r\ndeclarations of condition—'I'm scared'—and not belief—'I'm scared because\r\nsomeone threatened me.'\" (quoting State v. Garcia, 334 S.C. 71, 76, 512 S.E.2d\r\n507, 509 (1999))).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold trial counsel erred in failing to object to several portions of\r\nthe challenged testimony. To determine whether trial counsel's failure to object to\r\ninadmissible hearsay fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, we next\r\nexamine whether a legitimate trial strategy existed. See Strickland v. Washington,\r\n466 U.S. 668, 689-90 (1984).\r\n\r\nValid Trial Strategy\r\n\r\n\"Counsel must articulate a valid reason for employing a certain strategy to avoid a\r\nfinding of ineffectiveness.\" Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 470, 560 S.E.2d 401, 402\r\n(2002) (citing Roseboro v. State, 317 S.C. 292, 294, 454 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1995),\r\nStokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 548, 419 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1992)). \"Where counsel\r\narticulates a strategy, it is measured under an objective standard of\r\nreasonableness.\" Id. (citing Roseboro, 317 S.C. at 294, 454 S.E.2d at 313).\r\n\n\"Counsel's performance is accorded a favorable presumption, and a reviewing\r\ncourt proceeds from the rebuttable presumption that counsel 'rendered adequate\r\nassistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable\r\nprofessional judgment.'\" Smith v. State, 386 S.C. 562, 567, 689 S.E.2d 629, 632\r\n(2010) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S at 690 (1984)). \"Accordingly, when counsel\r\narticulates a valid reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be\r\ndeemed ineffective assistance of counsel.\" Id. (citing Caprood v. State, 338 S.C.\r\n103, 110, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000)).\r\n\r\n\"[Our supreme court] has held that the failure to object to improper hearsay\r\ntestimony in a [CSC] case because the testimony is merely cumulative to the\r\nvictim's testimony is not a reasonable strategy where the evidence is not\r\noverwhelming or the improper testimony bolsters the victim's testimony.\" Watson\r\nv. State, 370 S.C. 68, 72, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006) (citing Dawkins v. State, 346\r\nS.C. 151, 156-57, 551 S.E.2d 260, 263 (2001)); see Smith, 386 S.C. at 568, 689\r\nS.E.2d at 633 (finding the presumption of adequate representation based on a valid\r\ntrial strategy disappears when trial counsel acknowledges there was no trial\r\nstrategy in mind when failing to object to the improper hearsay and bolstering\r\ntestimony). \"'[I]t is precisely this cumulative effect which enhances the\r\ndevastating impact of improper corroboration.'\" Dawkins, 346 S.C. at 157, 551\r\nS.E.2d at 263 (quoting Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994)).\r\nIn Dawkins, our supreme court found trial counsel's explanation that he did not\r\nwant to confuse or upset the jury did not have merit because counsel \"could have\r\nsought a determination as to the inadmissibility of the hearsay testimony out of the\r\nhearing of the jury as he had previously done.\" Id. Further, the court found the\r\nstrategy was inappropriate given the fact \"there was not overwhelming evidence\r\nthat [the defendant] sexually abused [the victim].\" Id. at 157 n.7, 551 S.E.2d at\r\n263 n.7. \"For instance, while [the victim's] hymen was found to be ruptured upon\r\nmedical examination, this examination did not occur until approximately three\r\nyears after the alleged abuse had occurred.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\"However, where counsel articulates a valid reason for employing a certain\r\nstrategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\r\nWatson, 370 S.C. at 72, 634 S.E.2d at 644 (citing Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546,\r\n548, 419 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1992)). Distinguishing Watson from its decision in\r\nDawkins, our supreme court found trial counsel did not fail to object because of the\r\ncumulative effect of the corroborative testimony, \"but instead decided that\r\nobjections to the corroborative testimony might lead to the more damaging\r\nintroduction of the victim's videotape.\" Watson, 370 S.C. at 73, 634 S.E.2d at 644.\r\nThus, trial counsel articulated a valid reason for employing his strategy. Id.\r\n\nIn the present case, we note trial counsel's statement that some of the hearsay from\r\nwitnesses was also introduced through Victim's testimony is not a valid reason for\r\nfailing to object to it. See id. at 72, 634 S.E.2d at 644. Trial counsel admitted he\r\ncould have requested a hearing outside the presence of the jury concerning the\r\nconstant hearsay, but stated his strategies must have been slightly effective because\r\nthe jury acquitted Vail on two of the charges.\r\n\r\nPortions of the hearsay testimony exceeded the purpose of trial counsel's stated\r\ntrial strategies. First, the failure to object to Mullins's testimony about\r\ninappropriate behavior with another student does not seem to have any place\r\namidst his articulated trial strategies. We are unable to determine how Mullins's\r\ntestimony was relevant, much less part of a legitimate trial strategy. Trial counsel\r\nadmitted it could potentially be very damaging for the jury to hear there were\r\nrumors of Vail having inappropriate relations with another student and stated he\r\ndid not know why he failed to object to that portion of Mullins's testimony. He\r\ncommented that throughout the trial, he was trying to build Vail's credibility and be\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, trial counsel's failure to object to Murray's and John R.'s testimonies\r\ndoes not fit within the purpose of his stated trial strategies. Their statements went\r\ninto detailed accounts of the alleged relationship that were unnecessary to trial\r\ncounsel's strategy of showing Victim was \"obsessed\" with Vail and further, were\r\nnot necessary to build Vail's credibility. The only purpose these testimonies served\r\nwas to corroborate and bolster Victim's story and to evoke an emotional response\r\nfrom the jury, which was improper. See Dawkins, 346 S.C. at 157, 551 S.E.2d at\r\n263. Accordingly, we hold trial counsel's failure to object to inadmissible hearsay\r\nfell below the professional norms.\r\n\r\nPrejudice\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the record establishes trial counsel was deficient in failing to\r\nobject to numerous admissions of improper hearsay, thereby satisfying the first\r\nprong of Strickland. We next consider whether Vail was prejudiced by trial\r\ncounsel's deficient performance.\r\n\r\n\"[I]mproper corroboration testimony that is merely cumulative to the victim's\r\ntestimony cannot be harmless.\" Id. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 263; see Jolly v. State,\r\n314 S.C. 17, 21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994) (finding the admittance of the social\r\nworker's hearsay testimony identifying the defendant as the perpetrator could not\r\n\nbe harmless error because testimony was cumulative to social worker's unobjected\r\ntestimony and victim's testimony). \"'[I]t is precisely this cumulative effect which\r\nenhances the devastating impact of improper corroboration.'\" Dawkins, 346 S.C. at\r\n157, 551 S.E.2d at 263 (quoting Jolly, 314 S.C. at 21, 443 S.E.2d at 569).\r\n\r\nAs trial counsel admitted, Victim's credibility was \"extremely crucial\" to the\r\noutcome of this case regarding the alleged sexual relationship between her and\r\nVail, and there was otherwise an absence of overwhelming evidence of Vail's guilt.\r\nVictim's hymen was fully intact with either no evidence of trauma or the trauma\r\nhad healed despite the alleged six to nine incidents of sexual intercourse. There\r\nwas no eyewitness to any sexual or inappropriate activity. The State's case was\r\nbuilt upon Victim's story against Vail's story. See Smith v. State, 386 S.C. 562,\r\n568-69, 689 S.E.2d 629, 633 (2010) (finding that because the outcome of the case\r\nhinged on victim's credibility regarding identification of the perpetrator and there\r\nwas a lack of otherwise overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, the forensic\r\ninterviewer's hearsay testimony impermissibly corroborated the victim's\r\nidentification of defendant as the assailant); compare Huggler v. State, 360 S.C.\r\n627, 634-35, 602 S.E.2d 753, 757 (2004) (finding that because the victims'\r\ntestimonies on direct provided overwhelming evidence that sexual abuse did in fact\r\noccur, counsel's failure to object to admission of their written statements did not\r\nprejudice the outcome of the case and evidence of abuse was overwhelming even\r\nwithout the content in the written statements). Amongst the numerous instances of\r\ninadmissible hearsay noted in this opinion, we find the testimony from Father\r\nparticularly prejudicial, including his statement: \"Well, there was kind of a real\r\npoignant moment where she said, daddy, he took everything, she [sic] took\r\neverything I have.\" Moreover, Mullins's statement regarding an instance of\r\ninappropriate behavior with another student was highly prejudicial in light of what\r\nVail is charged with in this case.\r\n\r\nIn light of the circumstantial evidence presented to the jury in addition to the heavy\r\nemphasis on Victim's credibility, we cannot find the admission of the inadmissible\r\nhearsay was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we hold the trial\r\ncounsel's failure to object to instances of inadmissible hearsay was prejudicial to\r\nVail.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we hold the PCR court erred in determining some of the alleged\r\nhearsay statements either fell under an exception to the rule against hearsay or did\r\nnot meet the definition of hearsay. Trial counsel articulated a legitimate trial\r\n\nstrategy for some of his failures to object to inadmissible hearsay, but the\r\nremainder did not fit within his stated objective. Lastly, the failure to object to\r\nhearsay statements that did not fit within a legitimate trial strategy was highly\r\nprejudicial and cumulative and affected the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the denial of PCR and find Vail is entitled to a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concurring.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5072","title":"Cunningham v.

The administrator is responsible for the administration of all\r\ndepartments over which the Council has control.2 The Council's members are\r\nelected for two-year, non-staggered terms.3 Three of the Council's seven members\r\nwere not reelected in the November 4, 2008 general election.4\r\n\r\nDuring its November 18, 2008 meeting, the lame-duck Council (the 2008 Council)\r\namended the previously-noticed agenda to vote on a severance contract with the\r\nthen-current administrator, Joey Preston. This contract was drafted in anticipation\r\nof the termination of his employment. The 2008 Council voted 5-2 in favor of the\r\ncontract.5 During the same meeting, the 2008 Council voted 5-2 in favor of a\r\n\"Master Employment Agreement\" appointing Cunningham, then the assistant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. § 41-10-10 to -110 (Supp. 2012).\n\r\n2 See S.C. Code Ann. § 4-9-620 (1986) (describing office of the administrator).\n\r\n3 See S.C. Code Ann. § 4-9-610 (1986) (requiring council members to be elected in \n\r\nthe general election for terms of two or four years \"commencing on the first of \n\r\nJanuary next following their election\").\n\r\n4 The seven members were Michael Thompson, Bob Waldrep, Cindy Wilson, \n\r\nLarry Greer, Gracie Floyd, Bill McAbee, and Ron Wilson. Thompson, Greer, and \n\r\nMcAbee were not reelected in the November 2008 election. \n\r\n5 The five members voting in favor of the contract, which provided for a $1 million \n\r\ndollar payment to Preston, included the three \"lame-duck\" members. \n\r\n\nadministrator, as the new administrator for a three-year term.6 On November 19,\r\n2008, Cunningham signed the contract, which provided for a severance package in\r\nthe event he was later terminated \"without cause.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 2009, the new Council (2009 Council) met and passed a resolution\r\ncondemning the 2008 Council's actions in entering into the severance contract with\r\nJoey Preston and entering into the employment contract with Cunningham.7\r\nSubsequently, the 2009 Council's ad hoc personnel committee presented\r\nCunningham with a written at-will employment contract based on the position of\r\nthe 2009 Council that Cunningham's November 19, 2008 employment contract was\r\nno longer valid.8 After reviewing the new contract, Cunningham wrote a letter to\r\nthe members of the 2009 Council, dated January 27, 2009, stating that he saw no\r\nneed to sign a contract for at-will employment as the 2009 Council already viewed\r\nhis employment as at-will.\r\n\r\nAt its February 3, 2009 meeting, the 2009 Council voted to terminate\r\nCunningham's employment, stating that he had rejected the 2009 Council's two\r\nseparate proposals for an at-will employment contract.9 On February 9, the ad hoc\r\npersonnel committee met with Cunningham in executive session to discuss his\r\nemployment. Cunningham offered to \"enter into an agreement through the end of\r\nthe term of the [2009] [C]ouncil.\" At Cunningham's request, the 2009 Council\r\nconducted a public hearing on March 2, 2009 concerning his termination. At the\r\nconclusion of the hearing, the 2009 Council once again voted to remove\r\nCunningham from his position as Administrator.\r\n\r\nCunningham filed this action on April 22, 2009, asserting causes of action for\r\nBreach of Contract, Wrongful Discharge, and violation of the Payment of Wages\r\nAct. The parties engaged in discovery on the breach of contract claim but agreed\r\nto postpone discovery on the wrongful discharge claim until after the contract\r\nclaim had been resolved. Subsequently, Cunningham filed a motion for summary\r\n\r\n6 Likewise, the five members voting in favor of this contract included the three \n\r\nlame-duck members.\n\r\n7 The members of the 2009 Council were Eddie Moore, Bob Waldrep, Cindy \n\r\nWilson, Gracie Floyd, Tommy Dunn, Ron Wilson, and Tom Allen. \n\r\n8 This committee consisted of Bob Waldrep, Tommy Dunn, and Eddie Moore. \n\r\n9 The record does not indicate when the ad hoc personnel committee made the \n\r\nsecond proposal, which was for a demotion to the Assistant Administrator position, \n\r\nbut with a higher salary than what Cunningham previously received in that \n\r\nposition. \n\r\n\njudgment as to the breach of contract claim. The County filed a cross-motion for\r\nsummary judgment as to all three causes of action in Cunningham's complaint.\r\nCunningham then filed a second motion for summary judgment as to his claim\r\nunder the Payment of Wages Act. The circuit court denied Cunningham's\r\nsummary judgment motions and granted the County's summary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nIn granting the County's summary judgment motion, the circuit court concluded\r\nthat Cunningham's 2008 contract was void and could not bind the 2009 Council.\r\nThe circuit court also concluded that Cunningham's claim for accrued sick leave\r\nwas not compensable under the Payment of Wages Act because (1) the County did\r\nnot have a policy of compensating its at-will employees for accrued sick leave\r\nupon their termination; (2) the provision for sick leave in Cunningham's contract\r\nwas part of a void contract; and (3) the sick leave provision was part of the\r\nseverance package set forth in the contract, and the Payment of Wages Act\r\nexcludes severance from the definition of \"wages.\" Finally, the circuit court\r\nconcluded Cunningham could not avail himself of the public policy exception to\r\nthe at-will employment doctrine in support of his wrongful discharge claim\r\nbecause he did not claim that he was an at-will employee. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                             ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n1. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to the County as to the\r\nbreach of contract cause of action on the ground that Cunningham's employment\r\ncontract was void?\r\n\r\n2. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to the County as to\r\nCunningham's cause of action for violation of the South Carolina Payment of\r\nWages Act on the ground that Cunningham's accrued sick leave did not constitute\r\n\"wages\" under the Act?\r\n\r\n3. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to the County as to\r\nCunningham's wrongful discharge cause of action on the ground that Cunningham\r\ndid not claim he was an at-will employee?\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same\r\nstandard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Jackson v.\r\nBermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C. 11, 14 n.2, 677 S.E.2d 612, 614 n.2 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides that summary judgment shall be granted\r\n\nwhen \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\" \"At the summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not weigh\r\nconflicting evidence with respect to a disputed material fact.\" S.C. Prop. & Cas.\r\nGuar. Ass'n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nRather, \"[t]he purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases\r\nnot requiring the services of a fact finder.\" Matsell v. Crowfield Plantation Comm.\r\nServs. Ass'n, Inc., 393 S.C. 65, 70, 710 S.E.2d 90, 93 (Ct. App. 2011) (citing\r\nGeorge v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001)).\r\n\r\nAn adverse party may not rely on the mere allegations in his pleadings to withstand\r\na summary judgment motion, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a\r\ngenuine issue for trial. Strickland v. Madden, 323 S.C. 63, 68, 448 S.E.2d 581, 584\r\n(Ct. App. 1994). Nonetheless, \"in cases applying the preponderance of the\r\nevidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere\r\nscintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\"\r\nHancock v. Mid-S. Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009). \"In\r\ndetermining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences\r\nwhich can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party.\" Id. at 329-30, 673 S.E.2d at 802.\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.   Breach of Contract\r\n\r\nCunningham asserts the circuit court erred in concluding that his employment\r\ncontract was void. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Piedmont Public Service District v. Cowart, this court considered a twenty-year\r\nemployment contract between a special purpose district and its administrator that\r\nrequired five years' severance pay. 319 S.C. 124, 459 S.E.2d 876 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n(Cowart I), aff'd, 324 S.C. 239, 478 S.E.2d 836 (1996) (Cowart II). Relying on\r\nNewman v. McCullough, 212 S.C. 17, 46 S.E.2d 252 (1948), which involved an\r\nemployment contract with the City of Greenville, the court held that the contract\r\ninvolved the \"governmental or legislative powers\" of the District, and, therefore,\r\ncould not be binding on successor boards.10 Id. at 133, 459 S.E.2d at 881. In\r\n\r\n10The court also stated that the public policy concerns underlying this rule are\r\nequally applicable in cases where the members of the governing body have\r\n\napplying the law of municipalities to the District, the court acknowledged that\r\npublic service or special purpose districts are \"not necessarily equivalent to\r\nmunicipalities or municipal corporations for all purposes.\" Id. at 131 n.2, 459\r\nS.E.2d at 880 n.2 (citation omitted). However, the court noted \"for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the scope of the District's power to enter into contracts, the law\r\ngoverning municipal corporations is applicable.\" Id. (citations omitted); see also\r\nCity of Beaufort v. Beaufort-Jasper Cnty. Water & Sewer Auth., 325 S.C. 174, 178-\r\n79, 480 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1997) (applying Cowart I to Beaufort–Jasper County\r\nWater and Sewer Authority, a special purpose district).\r\n\r\nIn discussing contracts involving governmental or legislative powers, the opinions\r\nin Cowart I and Cowart II referenced not only municipalities but also \"each\r\ngoverning body\" and \"the local governing body.\" Cowart II, 324 S.C. at 241, 478\r\nS.E.2d at 837 (holding that the appointment of a public officer \"is a governmental\r\nfunction that cannot be impaired by an employment contract extending beyond the\r\nterms of the members of the local governing body\"); Cowart I, 319 S.C. at 133,\r\n459 S.E.2d at 881 (\"[I]t is clear the rule is intended to protect the public by\r\ninsuring that each governing body has available to it the powers necessary to\r\neffectively carry out its duties.\"). By logical extension, the fundamental principle\r\napplied in Cowart I and Cowart II also applies to Anderson County's actions in the\r\npresent case.11\r\n\r\nstaggered terms. Id. at 134-35, 459 S.E.2d at 881-82. Our supreme court agreed\r\nwith this statement. See Cowart II, 324 S.C. at 241-42, 478 S.E.2d at 838 (\"We\r\nagree with the Court of Appeals that the policy considerations are not changed by\r\nthe bestowal of perpetual succession.\").\r\n11 Other jurisdictions have recognized the applicability of the prohibition against\r\nbinding successor governing bodies to counties and county agencies. See Telford v.\r\nClackamas Cnty. Hous. Auth., 710 F.2d 567, 570 (9th Cir. 1983) (applying Oregon\r\nstate law to a contract of a county housing authority); id. (\"An Oregon public body\r\nmay not enter a contract for governmental functions extending beyond its own\r\nterm of office.\"); Valvano v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Union Cnty., 183 A.2d\r\n450, 454 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1962) (stating that a county board's \"eleventh-\r\nhour employment contract on the eve of a new administration\" circumscribed the\r\nsuccessor county board of its discretionary powers, \"which powers should have\r\nbeen transmitted unimpaired to the newly-constituted board\"); id. (\"Public policy\r\ndemands the utmost good faith and that municipal officials be not [sic] shorn of the\r\ndiscretionary powers of their office by any final action of their predecessors on\r\ntheir way out of office.\"); Morin v. Foster, 380 N.E.2d 217, 220 (N.Y. 1978)\r\n(recognizing that, but for a provision in a county's charter allowing for appointment\r\n\nWe find the following primer from Cowart I to be instructive:\r\n\r\n            If the term of the contract in question extends beyond the\r\n            term of the governing members of the municipality\r\n            entering into the contract, the validity of the contract is\r\n            dependent on the subject matter of the contract. The\r\n            general rule is that, if the contract involves the exercise\r\n            of the municipal corporation's business or proprietary\r\n            powers, the contract may extend beyond the term of the\r\n            contracting body and is binding on successor bodies if, at\r\n            the time the contract was entered into, it was fair and\r\n            reasonable and necessary or advantageous to the\r\n            municipality. However, if the contract involves the\r\n            legislative functions or governmental powers of the\r\n            municipal corporation, the contract is not binding on\r\n            successor boards or councils.\r\n\r\nId. at 132, 459 S.E.2d at 880 (emphasis added). Quoting from Newman, the court\r\nset forth the following rationale:\r\n\r\n            [W]here the contract involved relates to governmental or\r\n            legislative functions of the council, or involves a matter\r\n            of discretion to be exercised by the council[,] unless the\r\n            statute conferring power to contract clearly authorizes\r\n            the council to make a contract extending beyond its own\r\n            term, no power of the council to do so exists, since the\r\n            power conferred upon municipal councils to exercise\r\n            legislative or governmental functions is conferred to be\r\n            exercised as often as may be found needful or politic, and\r\n            the council presently holding such powers is vested with\r\n            no discretion to circumscribe or limit or diminish their\r\n\r\nof the county manager for a four-year term, the county's legislators would be\r\nunable to appoint the county manager for a term extending into the term of the\r\nlegislators' successors); Uintah Basin Med. Ctr. v. Hardy, 54 P.3d 1165, 1168\r\n(Utah 2002) (analyzing a contract between a doctor and a county-owned hospital);\r\nid. (\"Under the governmental/proprietary test, a contract is . . . unenforceable\r\nagainst successor governing bodies if it involves a governmental power or function\r\n. . . .\").\r\n\n            efficiency, but must transmit them unimpaired to their\r\n            successors.\r\n\r\nId. at 132, 459 S.E.2d at 880-81 (quoting Newman, 212 S.C. at 25-26, 46 S.E.2d at\r\n256) (emphasis added). The court distinguished between proprietary and\r\ngovernmental functions as follows:\r\n\r\n            [T]he difference between proprietary and governmental\r\n            functions is often difficult to determine, because, as the\r\n            scope of \"governmentality\" expands, the intertwining and\r\n            overlapping of such functions make it increasingly more\r\n            difficult to draw any definitive line of separation.\r\n            However, it is clear the rule is intended to protect the\r\n            public by insuring that each governing body has available\r\n            to it the powers necessary to effectively carry out its\r\n            duties. Thus, when determining whether a contract is\r\n            binding on successor boards, it appears that the true test\r\n            is whether the contract itself deprives a governing body,\r\n            or its successor, of a discretion which public policy\r\n            demands should be left unimpaired.\r\n\r\nId. at 132-33, 459 S.E.2d at 881 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Examples\r\nof proprietary functions include a town's contract with a private corporation to\r\nfurnish parking meters to the town12 and a city's contract with a private company\r\nfor the operation of the city's waterworks system.13\r\n\r\nIn Cowart II, our supreme court emphasized that the appointment or removal of a\r\npublic officer \"is a governmental function that cannot be impaired by an\r\nemployment contract extending beyond the terms of the members of the local\r\ngoverning body.\" 324 S.C. at 241, 478 S.E.2d at 837 (emphasis added) (citation\r\nomitted). \"Such a contract is not binding on the successors to the local governing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12See Town of Graham v.

However, the court did not ultimately rely on Dillon's rule\r\nin determining that Cowart's employment contract was void. Rather, the court\r\nrelied on the independent principle that governmental bodies have no authority to\r\nimpair the power and discretion delegated to their successors by the public,16 as\r\naptly expressed in Newman v. McCullough:\r\n\r\n             The power conferred upon municipal councils to exercise\r\n             legislative or governmental functions is done so to be\r\n             exercised as often as may be found needful or politic; and\r\n             the council holding such powers is vested with no\r\n             authority to circumscribe, limit or diminish their\r\n             efficiency, but must transmit them unimpaired to their\r\n             successors. That acting as a governmental agency, it is\r\n             bound always to act as trustee of the power delegated to\r\n             it and may not surrender or restrict any portion of such\r\n             power conferred upon it.\r\n\r\n212 S.C. at 25-26, 46 S.E.2d at 256 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n15 Codified at S.C. Code Ann. § 4-9-10 to -1230 (1986 & Supp. 2012) for counties \n\r\nand at S.C. Code Ann. § 5-7-10 to -310 (2004 & Supp. 2012) for municipal \n\r\ncorporations.\n\r\n16 319 S.C. at 132-36, 459 S.E.2d at 880-83.\n\r\n\nAs stated above, when determining whether a contract is binding on successor\r\ngoverning bodies, \"the true test is whether the contract itself deprives a governing\r\nbody, or its successor, of a discretion which public policy demands should be left\r\nunimpaired.\" Cowart I, 319 S.C. at 133, 459 S.E.2d at 881 (emphasis added). This\r\nprohibition against limiting the powers of a successor council as to governmental\r\nfunctions does not at all conflict with the requirement of the Home Rule Act to\r\nconstrue the powers of municipalities and counties in a liberal manner. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 4-9-25 (Supp. 2012) (\" The powers of a county must be liberally\r\nconstrued in favor of the county . . . .\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 5-7-10 (2004) (\"The\r\npowers of a municipality shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality . .\r\n. .\"). Therefore, Cunningham's argument regarding the abolition of Dillon's Rule is\r\nirrelevant to our analysis.\r\n\r\nCunningham also argues that the County's enabling legislation, the Home Rule\r\nAct, clearly authorized the lame-duck council to enter into an employment contract\r\nextending beyond the outgoing members' terms of office. We disagree. Section 4-\r\n9-620 of the South Carolina Code (1986) states, in pertinent part, \"The term of\r\nemployment of the [county] administrator shall be at the pleasure of the council\r\nand he shall be entitled to such compensation for his services as the council may\r\ndetermine. The council may, in its discretion, employ the administrator for a\r\ndefinite term.\"17 Despite Cunningham's argument to the contrary, the provisions of\r\nthe Home Rule Act governing municipal corporations operating under the Council-\r\nManager form of government contain identical language as to municipal managers.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 5-13-70 (2004) (\"The term of employment of the manager\r\nshall be at the pleasure of the council and he shall be entitled to such compensation\r\nfor his services as the council may determine. The council may, in its discretion,\r\nemploy the manager for a definite term.\"). Notwithstanding the existence of\r\nsection 5-13-70, the courts in Cowart I and Cowart II continued to endorse the\r\nprinciple that a local governing body cannot bind its successor with regard to the\r\nappointment or removal of a public officer.\r\n\r\nIn any event, we do not view the language of section 4-9-620 as clearly authorizing\r\nthe \"definite term\" to extend beyond the terms of the outgoing council members.\r\nTherefore, it does not fall within Newman's exception to the prohibition against\r\nbinding successor governing bodies. See Cowart II, 324 S.C. at 241, 478 S.E.2d at\r\n838 (\"Newman allows an exception, however, where the enabling legislation\r\n\r\n17In his petition for rehearing, Cunningham references the \"Surreply Brief of\r\nAmicus.\" We remind the parties that by order filed on June 1, 2012, this court\r\ndeclined to accept the Surreply Brief of Amicus for filing.\r\n\nclearly authorizes the local governing body to make a contract extending beyond\r\nits members' own terms.\" (emphasis added)); see also 16 Jade St., LLC v.

Code Ann. § 4-9-25 (Supp. 2012),\r\nwhich we previously referenced in this opinion. Section 4-9-25 requires the\r\npowers of a county to be liberally construed. Section 4-9-25 states in full:\r\n\r\n              All counties of the State, in addition to the powers\r\n             conferred to their specific form of government, have\r\n             authority to enact regulations, resolutions, and\r\n             ordinances, not inconsistent with the Constitution and\r\n             general law of this State, including the exercise of these\r\n             powers in relation to health and order in counties or\r\n             respecting any subject as appears to them necessary and\r\n             proper for the security, general welfare, and convenience\r\n             of counties or for preserving health, peace, order, and\r\n             good government in them. The powers of a county must\r\n             be liberally construed in favor of the county and the\r\n             specific mention of particular powers may not be\r\n\n             construed as limiting in any manner the general powers\r\n             of counties.18\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 4-9-25 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nWe do not view this provision as authorizing a county's lame-duck council to bind\r\nthe successor council as to governmental functions. Quite to the contrary,\r\nCunningham's argument that the outgoing Council could so bind its successor\r\nwould have a restrictive effect on county powers rather than a liberal one—that is,\r\nit would be restrictive on the successor governing body. Again, we find the\r\nstatutory requirement to liberally construe the powers of a county, as long as\r\nconsistent with our Constitution and general laws, to be compatible with Newman's\r\npolicy of prohibiting local governing bodies from binding their successors as to\r\ngovernmental functions unless clearly authorized by enabling legislation.\r\n\r\nCunningham argues in the alternative that the payment of severance under his\r\nemployment contract would be a proprietary function rather than a governmental\r\nfunction, and, hence, the 2008 Council was permitted to bind the 2009 Council as\r\nto payment of his severance. See Cowart I, 319 S.C. at 132, 459 S.E.2d at 880\r\n(holding that if the contract involves the exercise of the municipal corporation's\r\nbusiness or proprietary powers, it is binding on successor bodies \"if, at the time the\r\ncontract was entered into, it was fair and reasonable and necessary or advantageous\r\nto the municipality\"). Again, the appointment of a public officer is a governmental\r\nfunction that cannot be impaired by an employment contract extending beyond the\r\nterms of the members of the local governing body. Cowart II, 324 S.C. at 241, 478\r\nS.E.2d at 837. Accordingly, all provisions of such a contract, including provisions\r\nfor severance pay, are void.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court properly concluded that Cunningham's\r\n2008 contract was void and could not bind the 2009 Council. Therefore, we affirm\r\nsummary judgment for the County on this cause of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18 Notwithstanding the existence of a virtually identical provision for municipal\r\ncorporations, S.C. Code Ann. § 5-7-10 (2004), the courts in Cowart I and Cowart\r\nII continued to endorse the principle that a local governing body cannot bind its\r\nsuccessor with regard to governmental functions.\r\n\nII.   Payment of Wages Act\r\n\r\nCunningham asserts the circuit court erred in concluding that his accrued sick\r\nleave did not constitute \"wages\" under the Payment of Wages Act. Contrary to the\r\ncircuit court's ruling, Cunningham argues that the Act's exclusion of \"severance\"\r\nfrom the definition of \"wages\" does not bar his claim for sick leave because his\r\ncontract's provision for payment of accrued sick leave was not part of the\r\nseverance package required by the contract.19 See S.C. Code Ann. § 41-10-10(2)\r\n(Supp. 2012) (\"'Wages' means all amounts at which labor rendered is recompensed\r\n. . . and includes vacation, holiday, and sick leave payments which are due to an\r\nemployee under any employer policy or employment contract.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThis court may affirm for any ground appearing in the record on appeal. Rule\r\n220(c), SCACR. Here, we need not determine whether sick leave was part of the\r\ncontract's severance package because the sick leave claim is based solely on the\r\nproposition that the contract was valid and binding on the 2009 Council.20\r\n\r\n19 The circuit court's ruling as to the exclusion of severance from the Act's\r\ndefinition of wages was an alternative ruling; the circuit court's primary ruling as to\r\nthe Payment of Wages claim was that Cunningham was not entitled to accrued sick\r\nleave \"resulting from the termination of a void contract.\"\r\n20 Cunningham submits the alternative argument that the contract's provision for\r\npayment of accrued sick leave is severable from the remainder of the contract\r\npursuant to the severability clause in section 17(D) of the contract, which states, in\r\npertinent part:\r\n\r\n             If any provision, or any portion thereof, contained in this\r\n             Agreement is held to be unconstitutional, invalid, or\r\n             unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of\r\n             competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement\r\n             or the portion thereof in question shall be deemed\r\n             severable, shall not be affected thereby, and shall remain\r\n             in full force and effect.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). The County maintains that this argument is not preserved\r\nbecause the circuit court did not rule on it and Cunningham did not file a Rule\r\n59(e) motion seeking a ruling. Cunningham responds that because the trial court\r\nviewed the contract in its entirety as void, it would have been futile for him to seek\r\na ruling on the severability argument. Assuming, without deciding, this precise\r\nissue is preserved for review, we reject Cunningham's argument. Because the\r\n\nHowever, the contract was void. Further, Cunningham has admitted that he would\r\nnot be entitled to sick leave from the County if his contract is determined to be\r\nvoid as the County did not have a policy of compensating its at-will employees for\r\naccrued sick leave upon their termination. Therefore, we affirm summary\r\njudgment for the County on this cause of action.\r\n\r\nIII.   Wrongful Discharge\r\n\r\nCunningham maintains the circuit court erred in concluding he could not avail\r\nhimself of the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine on the\r\nground that he did not claim he was an at-will employee. We agree.\r\n\r\n             In South Carolina, employment at-will is presumed\r\n             absent the creation of a specific contract of employment.\r\n             An at-will employee may be terminated at any time for\r\n             any reason or for no reason, with or without cause.\r\n             Under the \"public policy exception\" to the at-will\r\n             employment doctrine, however, an at-will employee has\r\n             a cause of action in tort for wrongful termination where\r\n             there is a retaliatory termination of the at-will employee\r\n             in violation of a clear mandate of public policy. The\r\n             public policy exception clearly applies in cases where\r\n             either: (1) the employer requires the employee to violate\r\n             the law, or (2) the reason for the employee's termination\r\n             itself is a violation of criminal law.\r\n\r\nBarron v. Labor Finders of S.C., 393 S.C. 609, 614, 713 S.E.2d 634, 636-37\r\n(2011) (citations and quotation marks omitted). However, \"the public policy\r\nexception is not limited to these situations.\" Id. at 614, 713 S.E.2d at 637.21\r\n\r\ncircuit court correctly ruled that the contract was void in its entirety, no part of the\r\ncontract is valid or enforceable against the 2009 Council.\r\n21 \"The public policy exception does not, however, extend to situations where the\r\nemployee has an existing statutory remedy for wrongful termination.\" Id. at 615,\r\n713 S.E.2d at 637; see Epps v. Clarendon Cnty., 304 S.C. 424, 426, 405 S.E.2d\r\n386, 387 (1991) (declining to extend the public policy exception when the\r\nemployee has an existing remedy for a discharge that allegedly violates rights other\r\nthan the right to the employment itself and stating that the appellant claimed an\r\ninfringement of his constitutional rights to free speech and association, for which\r\nhe could seek redress in a § 1983 action). Additionally, \"[t]he determination of\r\n\nFurther, the existence of an employment contract does not preclude a\r\ndetermination that the employment is terminable at will. See Cape v. Greenville\r\nCnty. Sch. Dist., 365 S.C. 316, 319, 618 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2005) (\"An employment\r\ncontract for an indefinite term is presumptively terminable at will . . . .\").\r\n\r\nHere, within the wrongful discharge cause of action in the complaint, Cunningham\r\nalleged that the County conditioned his continued employment on his agreement to\r\n(1) \"implement directives of individual council members, including those that\r\nviolate actions directed by the body itself[;]\" (2) commit acts violating \"the public\r\npolicy regarding the respective powers of Administrator and Council[;]\" and (3)\r\n\"commit acts that, upon information and belief, would violate the policy set forth\r\nin S.C. Code Ann. § 16-17-560[.]\" Section 16-17-560 prohibits discharging a\r\ncitizen from employment because of political opinions or the exercise of political\r\nrights and privileges.\r\n\r\nThe County states that Cunningham has never claimed to be an at-will employee,\r\nand, therefore, he may not obtain relief based on the law governing at-will\r\nemployment. The County's statement is not entirely correct. Cunningham\r\npresented to the circuit court a \"Supplemental Filing Regarding Plaintiff's Motions\r\nfor Summary Judgment on Count[s] I and III and Defendant's Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment as to Counts I-III.\" Curiously, in this filing, Cunningham likened his\r\ncontract to the contract in Stiles v. Am. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 335 S.C. 222, 516 S.E.2d\r\n449 (1999)22: \"Plaintiff's contract is, by statute, defined as one for a definite term\r\n\r\nwhat constitutes public policy is a question of law for the courts to decide.\"\r\nBarron, 393 S.C. at 617, 713 S.E.2d at 638 (citation omitted). \"It is not a function\r\nof the jury to determine questions of law such as what constitutes public policy.\r\nRather, once a public policy is established, the jury would determine the factual\r\nquestion [of] whether the employee's termination was in violation of that public\r\npolicy.\" Id.\r\n22 In Stiles, our supreme court expanded the public policy exception to the at-will\r\ndoctrine to contracts with a mere thirty-day notice provision, technically a\r\n\"contract for a definite term.\" 335 S.C. at 225, 516 S.E.2d at 450. However, this\r\nexpansion was based on the fact that the employee did not have an alternative\r\nremedy for wrongful discharge as provided by typical contracts for a definite term;\r\nhe was merely entitled to a thirty-day notice of termination. Id. at 225-26, 516\r\nS.E.2d at 451. In other words, while a contact with a mere thirty-day notice\r\nprovision technically becomes a contract for a definite term once notice is given, it\r\nis otherwise effectively an at-will employment contract leaving the employee with\r\nno remedy for a wrongful termination. Id. at 225-26, 516 S.E.2d at 450-51.\r\n\nand it therefore falls within the rule recognized by the majority in Stiles.\"\r\n(emphasis added). While this argument is based on a misunderstanding of Stiles, it\r\nsufficiently undercuts the County's suggestion that Cunningham waived his \"at-\r\nwill\" argument by not presenting it to the circuit court; Cunningham presented the\r\nargument, albeit incorrectly, that his contract should be treated like the contract in\r\nStiles, which our supreme court viewed as \"placing the employee in the same\r\nposition as an at-will employee\" with the only difference being the contract's notice\r\nprovision. 335 S.C. at 226, 516 S.E.2d at 451.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Cunningham continues to rely on Stiles by characterizing his contract\r\nas providing for \"at-will status with a notice provision.\" Even though we have\r\nalready determined Cunningham's contract to be void, we engage in the following\r\nanalysis only to address Cunningham's characterization of his contract as \"at-will.\"\r\nCunningham claims that his contract's only limitation on the County's right to\r\nterminate him \"was the requirement that the County abide by the severance\r\nprovisions.\" Cunningham asserts that he \"still faced termination for any reason,\r\nincluding a reason that violates public policy.\" Curiously, Cunningham maintains\r\nboth that (1) the Master Employment Agreement established an at-will\r\nemployment relationship, despite the contract's generous severance remedy, and\r\n(2) at the same time, he can recover contract damages if the County does not pay\r\nthe designated severance amount upon terminating him without cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, the contract's severance provisions served as the intended contractual\r\nremedy for termination without cause before the end of the three-year term; the\r\nintent underlying the contract was that such an event would trigger the requirement\r\nto pay Cunningham the remainder of his salary and benefits for the balance of the\r\ncontract period. Such a contract does not establish an at-will employment\r\nrelationship. See Culler v. Blue Ridge Elec. Co-op., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 245, 422\r\nS.E.2d 91, 92 (1992) (\"The doctrine [of employment at will] in its pure form\r\nallows an employer to discharge an employee without incurring liability for good\r\nreason, no reason, or bad reason.\" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)); see also\r\nStiles, 335 S.C. at 225, 516 S.E.2d at 450 (\"The measure of damages when an\r\nemployee is wrongfully discharged under a contract for a definite term generally is\r\nthe wages for the unexpired portion of the term.\"); id. at 227, 516 S.E.2d at 451\r\n(Toal, J., concurring) (\"Employment in South Carolina has been classified as either\r\nfor a definite term or at-will.

John H.\r\nHarland Co., Inc., 310 S.C. 217, 220, 423 S.E.2d 105, 107 (1992) (\"This measure\r\nof damages allows an employee to receive the benefit of the bargain by putting him\r\nin as good a position as he would have been had the contract been performed.\").\r\n\r\nCunningham cites Angus v. Burroughs & Chapin Company, 358 S.C. 498, 596\r\nS.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 2004), rev'd on other grounds, 368 S.C. 167, 628 S.E.2d 261\r\n(2006) and Cape v. Greenville County School District, 365 S.C. 316, 618 S.E.2d\r\n881 (2005) in support of his position that his contract shows an intent to establish\r\nan at-will relationship. However, the contract in Angus stipulated that the public\r\nofficial was to be given \"365 days notice or 365 days severance pay in the event of\r\na termination.\" 358 S.C. at 500, 596 S.E.2d at 69 (emphasis added). The Record\r\non Appeal in Angus shows that the contract left the choice between these two\r\noptions to \"the discretion of [Horry County] Council\" and did not set forth any\r\ndistinction between termination with cause and termination without cause. In\r\ncontrast, Cunningham's contract sets forth the grounds for termination \"with cause\"\r\nand requires the County to pay Cunningham his salary and financial benefits for\r\nthe remainder of the three-year term if the County terminates Cunningham without\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nFurther, the contract in Cape contained language specifically stating \"THIS IS AN\r\nAT-WILL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. IT MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY\r\nTIME FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON BY EITHER EMPLOYER\r\nOR EMPLOYEE.\" 365 S.C. at 317, 618 S.E.2d at 882. In contrast, Cunningham's\r\ncontract states:\r\n\r\n             The Administrator serves at the pleasure of Council, and\r\n             nothing in this Agreement shall prevent, limit, or\r\n             otherwise interfere with the right of Anderson County\r\n             Council to terminate the services of the Administrator at\r\n             any time, subject only to the provisions set forth in\r\n             Section 3, Paragraphs A, B, and C of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Again, the provisions in Section 3, Paragraphs A and B, of\r\nCunningham's contract set forth the grounds for termination \"with cause\" and\r\nrequire the County to pay Cunningham his salary and financial benefits for the\r\nremainder of the three-year term if the County terminates Cunningham without\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has not expanded the public policy exception beyond contracts\r\nlike the one in Stiles. The reason is clear: contracts for a definite term that require\r\n\nthe payment of severance in the event of termination without cause provide a\r\nremedy for the employee if he is wrongfully discharged. See id. at 225, 516 S.E.2d\r\nat 450 (\"The measure of damages when an employee is wrongfully discharged\r\nunder a contract for a definite term generally is the wages for the unexpired portion\r\nof the term.\"); see also Cape, 365 S.C. at 318, 618 S.E.2d at 882 (\"Cape argues the\r\njudge erred in finding her contract was at-will. She correctly points out that\r\ndecisions from this Court have indicated an employment contract for a specific\r\nterm cannot also be at-will because these terms are mutually exclusively.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); Stiles, 335 S.C. at 228, 516 S.E.2d at 452 (Toal, J., concurring)\r\n(\"[T]he [public policy] exception is not designed to overlap an employee's\r\nstatutory or contractual rights to challenge a discharge, but rather to provide a\r\nremedy for a clear violation of public policy where no other reasonable means of\r\nredress exists.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nHere, the intent underlying Cunningham's contract was to provide the exact\r\nmeasure of damages specified by our supreme court in Stiles, i.e., the wages, or\r\nsalary, for the unexpired portion of the three-year term. This ability to recover\r\ndamages in the form of \"severance\" would normally preclude recovery under a\r\ncause of action for wrongful termination based on the public policy exception to\r\nthe at-will doctrine. See id. However, as we have previously concluded,\r\nCunningham's contract was void because it purported to bind the 2009 Council. It\r\nwas the illegality of his contract, rather than any contractual intent to create an at-\r\nwill employment relationship, that relegated Cunningham to an at-will status.23\r\nHence, there is nothing incorrect or unjust in allowing Cunningham to seek any\r\nremedy available to an at-will employee. See Rule 8, SCRCP (\"All pleadings shall\r\nbe so construed as to do substantial justice to all parties.\"); Russell v. City of\r\nColumbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991) (\"[P]leadings in a case\r\nshould be construed liberally so that substantial justice is done between the\r\nparties.\"). Therefore, the circuit court erred in concluding that Cunningham was\r\nprecluded from asserting a wrongful discharge claim based on the public policy\r\nexception to the at-will employment doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe County also argues that even if Cunningham could invoke the public policy\r\nexception to the at-will employment doctrine, the facts alleged in the complaint\r\nwould not entitle him to relief because they do not establish a violation of public\r\n\r\n23See Barron, 393 S.C. 609, 614, 713 S.E.2d 634, 636-37 (\"In South Carolina,\r\nemployment at-will is presumed absent the creation of a specific contract of\r\nemployment. An at-will employee may be terminated at any time for any reason or\r\nfor no reason, with or without cause.\").\r\n\npolicy. We disagree. Cunningham alleged that the County conditioned his\r\ncontinued employment on his agreement to engage in acts that would violate S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 16-17-560, which prohibits discharging a citizen from employment\r\nbecause of political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges.\r\nTherefore, the allegations in Cunningham's complaint clearly invoke the public\r\npolicy exception. See Barron, 393 S.C. at 614, 713 S.E.2d at 637 (\"The public\r\npolicy exception clearly applies in cases where . . . the employer requires the\r\nemployee to violate the law\").24\r\n\r\nFurther, during the motions hearing, counsel for the County admitted that if the\r\ncircuit court denied the County's summary judgment motion as to Cunningham's\r\nlegal ability to assert the wrongful discharge cause of action and as to the\r\nsufficiency of the allegations in the complaint, then the parties would have to\r\nengage in further discovery. Counsel for both parties represented to the circuit\r\ncourt that they had an agreement to allow discovery on this cause of action if the\r\ncircuit court denied summary judgment on it. Both counsel further agreed to\r\nallow the County the option of submitting another summary judgment motion on\r\nthe wrongful discharge claim after the completion of discovery. \"Summary\r\njudgment is a drastic remedy and must not be granted until the opposing party has\r\nhad a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.\" Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C.\r\n58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nFinally, Cunningham has demonstrated the likelihood of uncovering additional\r\nrelevant evidence during discovery. See Dawkins, 354 S.C. at 69, 580 S.E.2d at\r\n439 (holding that when the nonmoving party requests a delay in ruling on a\r\nsummary judgment motion until further discovery may be completed, the party\r\nmust demonstrate the likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional\r\nrelevant evidence). Cunningham testified in his deposition that Eddie Moore, who\r\nhad recently been elected but had not yet taken office, stated to him: \"'[T]here are\r\nlots of employees that there's problems with . . . If I were to give you a list of\r\nemployees to fire, would you get rid of them?\" Cunningham responded by\r\nindicating that there would have to be a reason for a termination and \"some\r\ndemonstration of some attempt to remedy the situation in most cases . . . .\"\r\nAlthough Mr. Moore was not yet seated on council, after he was sworn in he voted\r\nto terminate Cunningham's employment. Hence, Cunningham's testimony\r\n\r\n24We decline to rule on whether the other allegations in the complaint invoke the\r\npublic policy exception. See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (\"It is within the appellate court's discretion\r\nwhether to address any additional sustaining grounds.\").\r\n\nsufficiently demonstrates a likelihood that further discovery will uncover\r\nadditional evidence relevant to an attempted violation of section 16-17-560.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the\r\nwrongful discharge claim and remand the claim to the circuit court so that the\r\nparties may engage in further discovery.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to the\r\nCounty as to Cunningham's causes of action for breach of contract and violation of\r\nthe Payment of Wages Act. We reverse the circuit court's grant of summary\r\njudgment to the County as to Cunningham's wrongful discharge cause of action\r\nand remand to the circuit court to allow the parties to engage in further discovery.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5086","title":"Charleston County Assessor v.

(LMP) at\r\n$8,565,000. The Assessor argues the ALC erred in determining the units' highest\r\nand best use on the valuation date of December 31, 2003, the operative date for the\r\n\nlast countywide reassessment in Charleston County, instead of December 31, 2007,\r\nfor the tax year 2008. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe subject property, named The Legends, is located in Mount Pleasant and\r\nconsists of thirteen two-story buildings. LMP's predecessor in title to the property\r\nis Keystone Legends I, L.P. (\"Keystone\"). Keystone mortgaged the property in\r\n1999 for $15,891,900 to build the complex, which was originally composed of two\r\nhundred apartment units. In April 2006, LMP purchased The Legends for $5.00\r\nand assumed the mortgage. Just prior to conveying the property to LMP, Keystone\r\nlegally converted the units to condominiums by establishing a horizontal property\r\nregime pursuant to section 27-31-10 et seq. of the South Carolina Code (2007 &\r\nSupp. 2012). At the time of the hearing before the ALC, LMP had sold fifty-eight\r\nof the two hundred units and placed twenty-one units aside for further marketing\r\nand sale. The remaining one hundred twenty-one units, which are the subject of\r\nthis appeal, have continued to be owned and leased to third parties by LMP\r\nalthough they are titled as condominiums.\r\n\r\nFollowing the title conversion of the apartments into condominiums, the Assessor\r\nchanged its records to reflect the property as two hundred separate units and\r\nassigned each unit a separate tax identification number. The Assessor also\r\nreviewed the units' valuation for ad valorem taxation purposes, and, by assessing\r\neach unit individually as a condominium, determined that the fair market value of\r\nthe units for the tax year 2008 was $16,454,000. LMP disagreed with the\r\nAssessor's valuation and submitted a timely request for review to the Assessor.\r\nThe Assessor declined to alter its original valuation, and LMP sought review of the\r\nvaluation with the Charleston County Board of Assessment Appeals (Board).\r\nFollowing a hearing on November 4, 2009, the Board set a value of $10,090,500\r\nfor the tax year 2008.\r\n\r\nThe Assessor filed a request for a contested case hearing with the ALC, seeking\r\nreview of the Board's decision, and the ALC held a hearing on the matter on\r\nAugust 24, 2010. At the hearing, the parties agreed that the date for valuing the\r\nproperties was December 31, 2003, because 2004 was the year of the countywide\r\nreassessment. However, the parties disagreed as to when the highest and best use\r\nof the units was to be determined for purposes of valuing the property. The\r\nAssessor argued that the highest and best use of the units was to be determined as\r\nof December 31, 2007. Accordingly, the Assessor contended the highest and best\r\nuse of the units was as condominiums because the units were titled as\r\n\ncondominiums on December 31, 2007. In contrast, LMP countered that the proper\r\ndate for determining the highest and best use was December 31, 2003. Based on\r\nthis date, LMP contended that the highest and best use of the units was as\r\napartments because the mortgage on the property in 2003 required that the units be\r\nused as apartments. Specifically, the loan used to finance the construction of the\r\nunits was procured from the United States Department of Housing and Urban\r\nDevelopment and prohibited 1) the prepayment of the indebtedness until March 1,\r\n2006, and 2) the use of the units for any other purpose other than that intended at\r\nthe time the mortgage was executed. In the alternative, LMP argued that the units\r\nshould be valued as apartments because 1) due to the decline in the economy,\r\napartments were the highest and best use of the property in 2007 and 2) pursuant to\r\nthe supreme court's holding in Lindsey v. South Carolina Tax Commision, 302 S.C.\r\n504, 397 S.E.2d 95 (1990), the units should be valued based on their use, as\r\napartments, rather than how they are titled, as condominiums.\r\n\r\nIn its order, the ALC agreed with LMP and found that section 12-43-215 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) required that the highest and best use of the\r\nunits be determined on the valuation date, which the parties agreed was December\r\n31, 2003. Specifically, the ALC found that because \"the assessment process is so\r\nintertwined with the valuation process . . . the legislative intent is clear [and t]he\r\nproperty's fair market value must be based on the property's highest and best use on\r\nthe valuation date . . . .\" Accordingly, the ALC found that the highest and best use\r\nof the units was as apartments because the mortgage on the units in 2003\r\nprohibited them from being used as condominiums. In making this determination,\r\nthe ALC relied upon the methodology endorsed by the Appraisal Institute, which\r\nprovides that a property's highest and best use must be \"physically possible, legally\r\npermissible, financially feasible, and maximally profitable . . . .\"1 Because the\r\nALC agreed with LMP's argument that the highest and best use of the units should\r\nbe determined as of December 31, 2003, the ALC declined to address LMP's\r\nremaining arguments. Based on its valuation of the units as apartments, the ALC\r\nadopted the valuation of the Assessor's witness Gary James, who valued the\r\nproperty at $8,565,000. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"Tax appeals to the ALC are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).\"\r\nCFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty. Assessor, 395 S.C. 67, 73, 716 S.E.2d 877, 880\r\n\r\n1The parties do not appeal the ALC's reliance on this method of determining the\r\nhighest and best use of the units.\r\n\n(2011). \"Accordingly, we review the decision of the ALC for errors of law.\" Id. at\r\n74, 716 S.E.2d at 881. \"Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law,\r\nwhich we are free to decide without any deference to the court below.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Highest and Best Use\r\nThe Assessor argues that the ALC erred in determining the highest and best use of\r\nthe units as of December 31, 2003, the date of valuation used for the last\r\ncountywide reassessment in 2004. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the legislature.\" Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459\r\n(2007). \"When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is\r\nno room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to\r\nits literal meaning.\" Id. In interpreting a statute, \"[w]ords must be given their\r\nplain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit\r\nor expand the statute's operation.\" Id. at 499, 640 S.E.2d at 459. Further, \"the\r\nstatute must be read as a whole and sections which are part of the same general\r\nstatutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.\" S.C. State\r\nPorts Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006).\r\nAccordingly, we \"read the statute as a whole\" and \"should not concentrate on\r\nisolated phrases within the statute.\" CFRE, LLC, 395 S.C. at 74, 716 S.E.2d at\r\n881.\r\n\r\nSection 12-37-930 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) provides that\r\n\r\n             [a]ll property must be for taxation at its true value in\r\n             money which in all cases is the price which the property\r\n             would bring following reasonable exposure to the\r\n             market, where both the seller and the buyer are willing,\r\n             are not acting under compulsion, and are reasonably well\r\n             informed of the uses and purposes for which it is adapted\r\n             and for which it is capable of being used.\r\n\r\n\"Fair market value is the measure of value for taxation purposes under this statute.\"\r\nLindsey v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 302 S.C. 504, 507, 397 S.E.2d 95, 97 (1990).\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, \"[t]he pertinent date to determine the value of property for a given tax\r\nyear is December 31st of the preceding year.\" Lindsey v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 302\r\n\nS.C. 274, 275 n.1, 395 S.E.2d 184, 185 n.1 (1990); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 12-\r\n37-900 (Supp. 2012). However, section 12-43-215, which the parties and the ALC\r\nagreed controls in the instant case,2 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n             When owner-occupied residential property assessed\r\n             pursuant to Section 12-43-220(c) is valued for purposes\r\n             of ad valorem taxation, the value of the land must be\r\n             determined on the basis that its highest and best use is for\r\n             residential purposes. When a property owner or an agent\r\n             for a property owner appeals the value of a property\r\n             assessment, the assessor shall consider the appeal and\r\n             make any adjustments, if warranted, based on the market\r\n             values of real property as they existed in the year that the\r\n             equalization and reassessment program was conducted\r\n             and on which the assessment is based. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe parties and the ALC agreed that in order to calculate the property's fair market\r\nvalue, the property's highest and best use must first be determined, but disagree as\r\nto the date on which the highest and best use must be determined. LMP contends\r\nthat section 12-43-215 requires that the highest and best use be determined as of\r\nDecember 31, 2003, the date used for the last countywide reassessment program in\r\nCharleston County. However, we agree with the Assessor that the appropriate date\r\nfor determining the units' highest and best use is December 31, 2007.\r\n\r\nSection 12-43-215 states merely that any adjustments to a property's value must be\r\n\"based on the market values of real property as they existed in the year that the\r\nequalization and reassessment program was conducted . . . .\" The statute is silent\r\non the date to be used for determining the highest and best use of the property.\r\nAccordingly, it cannot be read to mandate a diversion from the general rule that the\r\nuse of the property is to be determined as of December 31st of the preceding year.\r\nSuch a finding would result in potentially unreasonable and illogical valuations in\r\ninstances when the use of a property changes, potentially dramatically, from the\r\n\r\n2 Because section 12-43-215 applies to \"owner-occupied residential property\" and\r\nthe units at issue in the instant case are not owner-occupied, we question whether it\r\napplies in the instant case; nevertheless, because no party appealed the ALC's\r\nruling that section 12-43-215 applies, this ruling is the law of the case. See\r\nCarolina Chloride, Inc. v. Richland Cnty., 394 S.C. 154, 172, 714 S.E.2d 869, 878\r\n(2011) (noting \"an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, becomes the law of the\r\ncase\").\r\n\ntime of the last countywide reassessment. Further, we find that the purpose of the\r\nstatute, which provides some stabilization to the property taxes owed on a piece of\r\nproperty, is less viable in circumstances in which the property owner intentionally\r\nand willingly changes the use of a property. Therefore, we reverse the ALC's order\r\nto the extent it determined the highest and best use of the units based on a date of\r\nDecember 31, 2003.\r\n\r\nII.   Lindsey Case\r\nThe Assessor also argues that because LMP failed to appeal the ALC's ruling that\r\nLindsey v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 302 S.C. 504, 397 S.E.2d 95 (1990),\r\ndoes not apply to the facts of the instant case, that ruling is the law of the case.\r\nThis argument is without merit.\r\n\r\nFirst, the ALC did not rule that the holding in Lindsey does not apply to the facts of\r\nthis case, but rather declined to address the issue because it agreed with LMP's\r\nargument that the highest and best use was to be determined as of December 31,\r\n2003, and was, therefore, as apartments. Accordingly, the law of the case doctrine\r\ndoes not apply because there was no ruling on the issue of whether Lindsey applied\r\nfor LMP to appeal. See Carolina Chloride, Inc., 394 S.C. at 172, 714 S.E.2d at\r\n878 (noting \"an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, becomes the law of the case\").\r\nTherefore, this argument is both factually and legally without merit.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the ALC's order to the extent it determined the\r\nhighest and best use of the units based on a date of December 31, 2003, and we\r\nremand so that the ALC may address the parties' remaining arguments regarding\r\nvaluation of the units.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the ALC's order is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I agree with Judge Williams that December 31, 2007, is\r\nthe correct date for determining the highest and best use of the property. I\r\ndisagree, however, that we must consider section 12-43-215 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (Supp. 2012) under the law of the case doctrine. See note 2, supra. The\r\n\nALC's reliance on the section is part of its analysis; it is not the court's ruling. The\r\nlaw of the case doctrine applies to unappealed \"rulings.\" Carolina Chloride, Inc.,\r\nsupra; Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Hous. Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525\r\nS.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (\"unappealed ruling is law of the case\" (citing ML-Lee\r\nAcquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte & Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470,\r\n472 (1997))). The ALC's ruling is that the proper date is December 31, 2003. The\r\nassessor appealed that ruling.\r\n\r\nThe parties appear to agree with the ALC that section 12-43-215 applies.\r\nHowever, the plain language of the section restricts its application to \"owner-\r\noccupied residential property.\" Because the units whose values are in dispute here\r\nare not owner-occupied, the section does not apply. The fact that all parties and\r\neven the lower court mistakenly believe a statute applies does not require this court\r\nto interpret the statute when we find it to be inapplicable. The law of the case\r\ndoctrine does not preclude this court from disagreeing with the basis of the lower\r\ncourt's analysis even when that basis is not challenged on appeal.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., dissenting: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the ALC's\r\ndetermination that the property's fair market value must be based on the property's\r\nhighest and best use on the valuation date, which is December 31, 2003.\r\n\r\nInitially, the parties agreed to apply section 12-43-215 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2012). Additionally, neither party appealed the ALC's application of\r\nsection 12-43-215. Therefore, the ALC's application of section 12-43-215, while\r\nincorrect, is the law of the case because South Carolina does not utilize a plain\r\nerror rule of appellate procedure. See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9,\r\n24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (\"South Carolina appellate courts do not recognize\r\nthe 'plain error rule,' under which a court in certain circumstances is allowed to\r\nconsider and rectify an error not raised below by the party.\"); Atl. Coast Builders &\r\nContractors, LLC v. Lewis, 398 S.C. 323, 329, 730 S.E.2d 282, 285 (2012) (\"[A]n\r\nunappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case.\").\r\n\r\nConstruing the statute in favor of the taxpayer, I would find a plain reading of\r\nsection 12-43-215 provides that December 31, 2003, is the correct date to\r\ndetermine the highest and best use of the property. See Alltel Commc'ns, Inc. v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Revenue, 399 S.C. 313, 321, 731 S.E.2d 869, 873 (2012) (holding an\r\nambiguity in a tax statute must be construed in the taxpayer's favor); S.C. Nat'l\r\nBank v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 297 S.C. 279, 281, 376 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1989) (\"In the\r\nenforcement of tax statutes, the taxpayer should receive the benefit in cases of\r\ndoubt.\"). According to section 12-43-215, the highest and best use of the property\r\n\ndetermines the value of the land and the market value of the land is to be\r\ndetermined by the last countywide reassessment year. See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-\r\n43-215 (Supp. 2012) (\"When owner-occupied residential property assessed\r\npursuant to Section 12-43-220(c) is valued for purposes of ad valorem taxation, the\r\nvalue of the land must be determined on the basis that its highest and best use is\r\nfor residential purposes. When a property owner or an agent for a property owner\r\nappeals the value of a property assessment, the assessor shall consider the appeal\r\nand make any adjustments, if warranted, based on the market values of real\r\nproperty as they existed in the year that the equalization and reassessment\r\nprogram was conducted and on which the assessment is based.\" (emphases\r\nadded)). Because the highest and best use determines the value of the property,\r\nand the last countywide reassessment was in 2004, the proper date to utilize in\r\ndetermining the property's highest and best use pursuant to the statute is December\r\n31, 2003. For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the order of the ALC.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5093","title":"Bass v.

The Basses alleged DSS failed to conduct a thorough\r\ninvestigation before deciding to remove the children from their custody. DSS\r\nadmitted the investigation was not thorough, but argued its involvement with the\r\nfamily showed at least slight care. In a general verdict, the jury found for the\r\nBasses on both their gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional\r\ndistress causes of action. DSS appeals the denial of its motion for JNOV, arguing\r\nthe trial court erred in holding jury questions existed as to whether: (1) DSS was\r\ngrossly negligent in investigating the family; (2) the Basses voluntarily participated\r\nin the children's relative placement; and (3) DSS was liable under an intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress theory. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn April 30, 2008, Diane Bass refilled her children's prescription at Long's Drugs.\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone at the time, the pharmacist mixed the prescription at a\r\nconcentration of over one thousand times the prescribed strength. When the\r\nBasses administered the medication to their children on May 15, 2008, two\r\nchildren became sick, resulting in their hospitalization. DSS responded to the\r\nhospital after receiving a report of a potential parental poisoning. Within twenty-\r\nfour hours, the Basses signed a document entitled \"Safety Plan,\" in which the\r\nBasses agreed their children would reside with a relative, Linda Sims. On June 17,\r\n2008, an insurance representative contacted DSS and indicated the children's\r\nprescription may have been filled at too strong a dose. As a result, DSS returned\r\nthe children to the Basses on June 25, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe Basses filed a complaint against DSS, Long's Drugs, and the pharmacist who\r\nfilled the prescriptions. After settling with Long's Drugs and the pharmacist, the\r\nBasses filed an amended complaint solely against DSS. The amended complaint\r\nraised three causes of action: (1) defamation; (2) gross negligence; and (3)\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. The gross negligence and intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress claims alleged DSS was grossly negligent and\r\nreckless, respectively, in placing the children in DSS custody without properly\r\ninvestigating the claims against the Basses.\r\n\r\nDSS answered and denied the Basses' claims. Specifically, DSS affirmatively\r\nalleged DSS took appropriate steps to secure the safety of the children and the\r\nBasses voluntarily signed the Safety Plan to place the children with a relative.\r\nDSS also raised as an affirmative defense that the harm caused to the Basses was\r\ncaused by Long's Drugs's intervening negligence as a third party.\r\n\nMonique Parish, the DSS caseworker assigned to the Basses, testified by\r\ndeposition at trial. According to Parish, she responded to the hospital forty-five\r\nminutes after receiving the initial complaint against the Basses. Parish further\r\ntestified she retrieved the children's lab results when she arrived at the hospital, but\r\nthey were inconclusive as to poisoning. Parish, however, did admit she never\r\ntalked to a doctor about the poisoning during her initial investigation. Parish also\r\nexplained she met with the Basses when she responded to the hospital, gave them a\r\nbrochure explaining the investigation, and had them sign releases concerning the\r\nchildren's medical information. The Basses' expert in child protection services,\r\nMichael Corey, opined during trial that Parish did not exercise slight care in\r\nconducting her investigation.\r\n\r\nAfter the Basses rested their case, DSS moved for directed verdicts on all causes of\r\naction. DSS argued the Basses failed to present any evidence of gross negligence\r\nand all of the evidence presented showed DSS exercised slight care. The Basses\r\nfurther asserted they were entitled to a directed verdict on the intentional infliction\r\nof emotional distress claim because the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Act)\r\nexcludes \"intentional infliction of emotional harm\" from the definition of a\r\nrecoverable loss. The trial court denied the motions. DSS renewed its motion at\r\nthe close of its case, which the trial court denied.1\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict against DSS, finding DSS liable to the Basses in the\r\namount of $4,000,000. DSS made various post-trial motions. DSS first moved for\r\na JNOV on the same grounds set forth in its directed verdict motion during trial.\r\nDSS also moved for a JNOV because the Basses voluntarily agreed to the\r\nplacement of their children with relatives after having been advised of their legal\r\nrights. DSS further asked the trial court to reduce the verdict to $140,000 due to a\r\nlack of evidence indicating either the parents or children were damaged in any\r\nappreciable way by the placement. In the alternative, DSS sought to have the\r\nverdict reduced to $600,000 as provided by the Act's statutory cap.\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted DSS's motion to reduce the verdict to $600,000, but denied\r\nthe JNOV motions. First, the trial court found evidence in the record existed from\r\nwhich a jury could decide DSS did not exercise slight care before removing the\r\nchildren. Second, the trial court found the Act does not preclude recovery for\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claims so long as the conduct underlying\r\nthe claim constitutes recklessness. Additionally, the trial court found the lack of\r\n\r\n1   The Basses withdrew their defamation claim at this time.\r\n\nany investigation by DSS before the removal and \"the unique circumstances of the\r\nfamily and the hospitalization of the children,\" could support a finding that DSS\r\nrecklessly inflicted emotional distress on the Basses. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nI. \t    Did the trial court err in denying DSS's JNOV motion on the gross\r\n        negligence cause of action?\r\n\r\nII. \t   Did the trial court err in denying DSS's JNOV motion because the record\r\n        does not support a finding that the children's placement was involuntary?\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Did the trial court err in denying DSS's JNOV motion on the intentional\r\n        infliction of emotional distress cause of action?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"In ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required to\r\nview the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the\r\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the motions\r\nwhere either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in\r\ndoubt.\" Strange v. S.C. Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30,\r\n445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994). \"The trial court can only be reversed by this [c]ourt\r\nwhen there is no evidence to support the ruling below.\" Jinks v. Richland Cnty.,\r\n355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.      \t ross Negligence\r\n        G\r\nDSS argues the trial court erred in denying its JNOV motion on the gross\r\nnegligence cause of action because no evidence in the record showed DSS was\r\ngrossly negligent in placing the children. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from . . . responsibility or\r\nduty . . . except when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent\r\nmanner.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60(25) (2005). Gross negligence is proved by\r\ndemonstrating the \"intentional conscious failure to do something which is\r\nincumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not\r\nto do,\" or \"the failure of slight care.\" Jinks, 355 S.C. at 345, 585 S.E.2d at 283. It\r\nhas also been defined as the absence of care that is necessary under the\r\n\ncircumstances. Id. Whether a defendant's actions are grossly negligent is\r\nordinarily a mixed question of law and fact. Id.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours of receiving a report of suspected child abuse or neglect,\r\n\"[DSS] must begin an appropriate and thorough investigation to determine whether\r\na report of suspected child abuse or neglect is 'indicated' or 'unfounded.'\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-920(A)(1) (2010); see also Jensen v. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,\r\n297 S.C. 323, 331-32, 377 S.E.2d 102, 106-07 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding the\r\nsections mandating DSS investigate and intervene to remove an endangered child\r\nfrom the home create a special duty).\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence in the record, we hold the trial court erred in denying DSS's\r\nmotion for a JNOV on the Basses' gross negligence cause of action. Initially, the\r\nrecord indicates Parish responded to the hospital within forty-five minutes of the\r\nreported parental poisoning. Parish testified the children were classified as a\r\nmedium danger rating, allowing Parish merely twenty-four hours to conduct her\r\ninvestigation, pursuant to DSS policy. We find this time constraint, which has\r\nbeen specifically recognized by our supreme court, to be particularly important in\r\nour determination. See Spartanburg Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Little, 309 S.C.\r\n122, 125, 420 S.E.2d 499, 501 (1992) (declining to award attorney's fees against\r\nDSS in a child abuse and neglect case because \"DSS often must act quickly and\r\nwithout thorough investigation to remove children who may have been abused or\r\nneglected from potentially dangerous situations\"). In that time, Parish interviewed\r\nfamily members and learned the children became sick after Mrs. Bass administered\r\ntheir medicine. Parish also obtained the Basses' consent to have the children's\r\nmedical information released to DSS. Although it was ultimately inconclusive,\r\nParish further obtained the children's toxicology report. While far from perfect,\r\nthere is no evidence in the record indicating DSS failed to exercise slight care.\r\n\r\nThe Basses contend Michael Corey's expert opinion that DSS failed to exercise\r\nslight care is sufficient to defeat DSS's motion for JNOV. During his testimony,\r\nCorey opined DSS failed to exercise slight care and prefaced his opinion on DSS's\r\nduty to investigate the allegations of abuse and neglect. The record, however, is\r\ndevoid of any indication that Corey in any way took into account the expediency\r\nwith which DSS must investigate claims of abuse and neglect. Consequently,\r\nCorey failed to establish his opinion was based upon a proper statement of DSS's\r\nduty; therefore, it could not, without more, defeat DSS's motion for JNOV. Cf.\r\nHarris Teeter, Inc. v. Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C. 275, 289, 701 S.E.2d\r\n742, 749 (2010) (finding an expert's testimony insufficient to defeat a motion for\r\nsummary judgment when the expert failed to predicate his testimony on the correct\r\n\nstandard of care). Accordingly, we hold the trial court erred in denying DSS's\r\nmotion for a JNOV as to the gross negligence cause of action.\r\n\r\nII.    Voluntary Placement\r\nDSS argues the trial court erred in denying its JNOV motion because the Basses\r\nvoluntarily participated in the placement of the children. Only grounds raised in a\r\ndirected verdict motion, however, can be properly reasserted in a motion for a\r\nJNOV. In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 93, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001); see also\r\nRFT Mgmt. Co., L.L.C. v. Tinsley & Adams L.L.P., 399 S.C. 322, 331, 732 S.E.2d\r\n166, 171 (2012) (\"A motion for a JNOV is merely a renewal of the directed verdict\r\nmotion.\"). DSS never argued it was entitled to a directed verdict based on the\r\nBasses' voluntary placement of the children; therefore, DSS cannot properly raise\r\nthis issue. Even if properly raised, this issue would still not be preserved for\r\nreview because the trial court never made any sort of ruling with respect to the\r\nBasses' voluntariness in its order denying DSS's JNOV motion. See Herron v.\r\nCentury BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 465, 719 S.E.2d 640, 643 (2011) (noting an issue\r\nmust be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview). Thus, we decline to address this issue because it is not preserved for our\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nIII.   Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nDSS argues the trial court erred in denying its JNOV motion on the Basses'\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim. We agree.\r\n\r\nTo recover under an intentional infliction of emotional distress theory, a plaintiff\r\nmust establish\r\n\r\n             (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted\r\n                 severe emotional distress, or was certain, or\r\n                 substantially certain, that such distress would result\r\n                 from his conduct;\r\n\r\n             (2) the conduct was so \"extreme and outrageous\" so as to\r\n                 exceed \"all possible bounds of decency\" and must be\r\n                 regarded as \"atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a\r\n                 civilized community;\"\r\n\r\n             (3) the actions of the defendant caused plaintiff's\r\n                 emotional distress; and\r\n\n             (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was\r\n                 \"severe\" such that \"no reasonable man could expect to\r\n                 endure it.\"\r\n\r\nArgoe v. Three Rivers Behavioral Health, L.L.C., 392 S.C. 462, 475, 710 S.E.2d\r\n67, 74 (2011) (quoting Hansson v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 374 S.C. 352, 356, 650\r\nS.E.2d 68, 70 (2007)). During trial and in their complaint, the Basses asserted their\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim was based on DSS's reckless\r\nrather than intentional conduct. South Carolina courts have long recognized that\r\nan individual's negligent conduct can be so gross as to amount to recklessness. See\r\nBerberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 287, 709 S.E.2d 607, 612 (2011); Jeffers v.\r\nHardemann, 231 S.C. 578, 582, 99 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1957). The juxtaposition of\r\nthis principle mandates an individual's conduct cannot be reckless where it was not\r\nat least grossly negligent. See also 18 S.C. Jur. Negligence § 9 (2012)\r\n(\"Recklessness is a higher degree of negligence than gross negligence.\"). Thus,\r\nbased on our prior determination that DSS was not grossly negligent in\r\ninvestigating the Basses' case, DSS's conduct was not reckless as a matter of law.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court erred in denying DSS's motion for a JNOV.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the trial court's denial of DSS's motions for\r\nJNOV on the Basses' gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional\r\ndistress causes of action.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5094","title":"Neeltec Enterprises v.

Neeltec appeals arguing\r\n\nthe special referee erred in substituting the corporations because Long was\r\nresponsible for his employees' actions. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nNeeltec owns and operates a fireworks store called Fireworks Supermarket off of I-\r\n95 in Walterboro. According to Neeltec, it advertises heavily with billboards along\r\nnorthbound I-95. Neeltec asserted Long opened and operated a competing\r\nfireworks store next to Fireworks Supermarket and closer to the interstate exit.\r\nNeeltec averred Long changed his store's sign to read \"Fireworks Superstore\" in\r\nearly 2006 to capitalize on Neeltec's advertising. After Neeltec repainted its\r\noutside wall facing I-95 with an advertising display, Neeltec contended Long\r\nplaced a forty-five-feet-long, nine-feet-tall storage container on the front of Long's\r\nproperty, substantially blocking the view of Neeltec's store.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2006, Neeltec filed a complaint against \"Willard Long, d/b/a Foxy's\r\nFireworks, and d/b/a Fireworks Superstore,\" alleging Long violated the SCUTPA\r\nby employing unfair and deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of\r\ncompetition. Neeltec claimed Long's acts \"have damaged, threaten to damage, and\r\ncontinue to damage\" Neeltec's business by reducing sales. Neeltec requested\r\nactual, punitive, and statutory treble damages as well as attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\nLong's answer stated a South Carolina corporation named Hobo Joe's, Inc.\r\noriginally opened a store, named it \"Foxy's Fireworks,\" and later changed the sign\r\non the store to \"Fireworks Super Store.\" Long admitted Hobo Joe's, Inc. placed a\r\nstorage container in front of its store. Long stated Neeltec had sued the wrong\r\nparty, and he consented to the substitution of the proper defendant. By way of a\r\ncounterclaim, Long argued Neeltec's actions constituted a public nuisance.\r\n\r\nNeeltec served and filed a motion to amend the complaint and motion for a\r\ntemporary injunction. The motion to amend was granted. In June of 2007, the\r\ncase was referred to a special referee, who declined to issue the injunction. In\r\nAugust of 2007, Long served and filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the\r\nalternative, a substitution of parties.\r\n\r\nLong's motion asserted (1) Long did not individually own the Fireworks\r\nSuperstore; (2) Hobo Joe's, Inc. owned the store when the action began; (3) Fox's\r\nFireworks Superstore, Inc. now owned the store; (4) Neeltec did not assert a claim\r\nfor piercing the corporate veil nor was such a claim supported by the facts; and (5)\r\n\nNeeltec sued the wrong party. Long requested he be dropped as a defendant and\r\nHobo Joe's, Inc. and Fox's Fireworks Superstore, Inc. be added.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2008, the special referee met with the parties to hear Long's motion.1 At\r\nthe hearing, Long admitted the store was always owned by his corporations and,\r\nwhile he is the sole shareholder, he has never operated the store as a sole\r\nproprietorship.\r\n\r\nThe special referee filed an order in August of 2008, denying summary judgment.\r\nThe order found (1) Neeltec's claims were against the business Fireworks\r\nSuperstore, which is a corporation; (2) the complaint did not allege conspiracy\r\nbetween Long and the corporation; (3) the complaint did not allege failure to\r\nfollow corporate formalities or any other basis for piercing the corporate veil; and\r\n(4) Long was not the proper defendant for the claims presented. The special\r\nreferee held the action should proceed against the two corporations that have\r\nowned and operated Fireworks Superstore, Hobo Joe's, Inc. and Fox's Fireworks\r\nSuperstore, Inc.2 The order concluded:\r\n\r\n             [T]o the extent [Neeltec] wishes to articulate a\r\n             conspiracy claim against . . . Long, individually, along\r\n             with the subject corporations, [Neeltec] shall submit . . .\r\n             no later than thirty (30) days from the date of this Order,\r\n             a proposed Amended Complaint setting forth any such\r\n             claims as well as a short Memorandum of Law . . . .\r\n\r\nThe Record does not indicate an amended complaint was ever filed. Neeltec\r\nappealed to this court, which dismissed the appeal because it was not immediately\r\nappealable. See Neeltec Enterps., Inc. v. Long, 391 S.C. 177, 705 S.E.2d 57 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011). Neeltec petitioned the South Carolina Supreme Court for certiorari,\r\nwhich the supreme court granted. On appeal, the supreme court reversed this court\r\nand found: \"The order requiring petitioner to discontinue its SCUTPA suit against\r\nrespondent Long affects petitioner's substantial right to name its defendant. This\r\ninterlocutory order is immediately appealable under § 14-3-330(2)(a)[ of the South\r\nCarolina Code].\" Neeltec Enterps., Inc. v. Long, 397 S.C. 563, 567, 725 S.E.2d\r\n926, 929 (2012) (citing Watts v. Copeland, 170 S.C. 449, 456-57, 170 S.E. 780,\r\n\r\n1No court reporter was present at the hearing, and thus, there is no transcript.\r\n2The order states the name of the corporation as Foxy's Firework Superstore, Inc.,\r\nbut the correct name is Fox's Fireworks Superstore, Inc.\r\n\n783 (1933)). The supreme court also noted the special referee's contention that\r\nNeeltec could amend its complaint to assert a conspiracy theory was irrelevant to\r\nthe appealability of the order. Id. at 567 & n.3, 725 S.E.2d at 929 & n.3 (citing\r\nMcMillan v. Oconee Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 565, 626 S.E.2d 884, 887\r\n(2006) (\"[A] corporation cannot conspire with itself.\")). The supreme court\r\nremanded the appeal to this court to consider the merits. Id. at 567-68, 725 S.E.2d\r\nat 929.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nNeeltec argues the special referee erred in substituting the corporations for Long.\r\nNeeltec argues Long should be personally liable for commanding or inducing the\r\ncorporation to commit a harmful act.3 We agree.\r\n\r\n\"[I]n private actions under the [SC]UTPA, directors and officers are not liable for\r\nthe corporation's unfair trade practices unless they personally commit, participate\r\nin, direct, or authorize the commission of a violation of the [SC]UTPA.\" Plowman\r\nv. Bagnal, 316 S.C. 283, 286, 450 S.E.2d 36, 38 (1994) (citing Donsco, Inc. v.\r\nCasper Corp., 587 F.2d 602 (3rd. Cir. 1978) (holding corporate officer is\r\nindividually liable for unfair competition in which he participates); E. Star, Inc. v.\r\nUnion Bldg. Materials Corp., 712 P.2d 1148 (Haw. Ct.

Mastodon Ventures, Inc., the complaint alleged the defendant was a\r\ncontrolling shareholder in a corporation \"and engaged in wrongful non-corporate\r\nactions and participated in [the corporation's] wrongful actions.\" C.A. No. 6:07-\r\n3805-HMH, 2008 WL 697150, at *2 (D.S.C. Mar. 12, 2008). The district court\r\n\r\n\r\n3Neeltec cites the doctrine of qui facit per alium facit per se, \"He who acts through\r\nanother, acts himself.\"\r\n\nfound the complaint stated causes of action against the defendant including\r\nviolation of the SCUTPA and denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. Id.\r\n\r\nAlthough Neeltec's action is for the violation of the SCUTPA, the supreme court\r\nhas found in tort cases:\r\n\r\n             An officer, director, or controlling person in a\r\n             corporation is not, merely as a result of his or her status\r\n             as such, personally liable for the torts of the corporation.\r\n             To incur liability, the officer, director, or controlling\r\n             person must ordinarily be shown to have in some way\r\n             participated in or directed the tortious act.\r\n\r\nRowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 369, 468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996) (citing Plowman,\r\n316 S.C. at 286, 450 S.E.2d at 38; Hunt v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 475, 272 S.E.2d 643\r\n(1980)). Further, \"a plaintiff has the sole right to determine which co-tortfeasor(s)\r\nshe will sue.\" Chester v. S.C. Dep't of Pub.

Long, 397 S.C. 563, 566, 725\r\nS.E.2d 926, 928 (2012) (noting this principle in remanding this case to our court).\r\n\r\nNeeltec's cause of action against Long was for the violation of the SCUTPA.\r\nBecause an officer or controlling person in a corporation may be individually\r\nliable, Neeltec is allowed to assert a claim against Long individually. Neeltec has\r\nthe right to decide which party it wishes to sue for certain acts. Accordingly, the\r\nspecial referee erred in substituting the two corporations for Long. Therefore, the\r\nspecial referee's order is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
