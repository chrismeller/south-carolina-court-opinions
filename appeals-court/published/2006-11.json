Harter, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Edman and Debbie Hackworth appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Greenville County and the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  The Hackworths seek to recover $152,016 seized during the sheriff departmentâ€™s investigation into their alleged illegal gambling.\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring 1999, the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department investigated Edman and Debbie Hackworth for suspected gambling activity.Â  The sheriffâ€™s department executed search warrants on the Hackworthâ€™s home, one of their businesses, and two safety deposit boxes. Â These searches yielded evidence of the Hackworthâ€™s gambling, including inter alia over $160,000 in cash, computers, phones, a paper shredder, and parlay cards.Â  On September 7, 1999, Edman and Debbie were arrested on charges of â€œbetting, pool-setting, bookmaking and the like,â€ and Edman was also charged with â€œsetting up a lottery.â€ \r\nUltimately, Edman reached a plea agreement with the sheriffâ€™s department whereby he would forfeit $152,016 of the seized cash and plea guilty to the lesser charge of â€œadventure in the lotteriesâ€ and pay a $125 fine. Â In exchange, all of the original charges against Debbie and Edman were nol prossed and approximately $14,000 was returned to them.Â  On September 30, 1999, Edman signed a document entitled â€œconsent forfeiture of monies derived from gambling.â€Â  This document stated that it was the partiesâ€™ desire to enter into a compromise settlement to avoid litigation, and that Edman voluntarily relinquished his right to $152,016 â€œpursuant to Â§ 16-19-80, Code of Laws of South Carolina (1976), as amended.â€[1]Â  Although the document had signature blocks for Edman, an assistant solicitor, a sheriffâ€™s deputy, and a circuit court judge, only Edman signed the document. \r\nEdman pled guilty to â€œadventure in the lotteriesâ€ and paid the $125 fine.Â  All three of the original charges against Edman and Debbie were nol prossed. \r\nThe Hackworths claimed the $152,016 forfeiture as a deduction from their federal income tax for 1999.Â  The Internal Revenue Service denied this deduction, and the federal tax court affirmed the denial at the resulting tax trial.Â  Two sheriffâ€™s department deputies served as witnesses at the Hackworthâ€™s tax trial. \r\nThe Hackworths claimed that during the tax trial they discovered that a judge did not sign the consent to forfeiture.Â  As a result, on April 7, 2004, they initiated the present action against the sheriffâ€™s department seeking to recover the $152,016. Â In the present civil action, the Hackworths assert unlawful seizure, conversion by the sheriffâ€™s department, and creation of a constructive trust to protect the money.Â  The circuit court heard oral arguments and granted the sheriffâ€™s departmentâ€™s motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 360 S.C. 366, 601 S.E.2d 342 (2004).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004).Â  â€œ[W]hen plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.â€Â  Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 355, 559 S.E.2d 327, 336 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Hackworths argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim on a motion for summary judgment and that the court incorrectly interpreted the requirements of civil forfeiture pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Section 16-19-80 (1976)Â  by disregarding due process rights to a hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe court granted summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.Â  For claims filed under the Tort Claims Act, the statute of limitations is two years after the loss was or should have been discovered.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (2005).Â  The date on which discovery of the cause of action should have been made is an objective, rather than subjective, question.Â  Kreutner v. David, 320 S.C. 283, 285, 465 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1995).Â  \r\n\r\nIn other words, whether the particular plaintiff actually knew he had a claim is not the test.Â  Rather, courts must decide whether the circumstances of the case would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against another party might exist.Â  \r\n\r\nYoung v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nOn September 30, 1999, the Hackworths either knew or should have known they lost their ownership interest in the $152,016 when Edman signed the consent to forfeiture.Â  If the Hackworths thought their property was improperly seized and retained, they should have initiated an action before September 30, 2001.Â  \r\nHowever, the Hackworths claim the statute of limitations should not run until after their federal tax case was resolved because the money was evidence at that time, and they could not get it back while the case was pending.Â  They assert the fact that two sheriffâ€™s deputies testified for the IRS gives them reason to believe the cash could have been used as evidence during trial. The money was never used in any of the Hackworthâ€™s court appearances.\r\nThere is no evidence in the record to support the Hackworthâ€™s position.Â  The only evidence indicating the Hackworths either knew or should have known that the sheriffâ€™s department claimed ownership interest in the money is the â€œconsent to forfeitureâ€ document and the testimony that the Hackworths claimed a deduction on their 1999 tax return for the exact amount of the forfeiture.Â  There is no testimony to suggest the cash was retained as sheriffâ€™s department property on any date other than September 30, 1999, the date of the forfeiture.Â  Therefore, the statute of limitations began to run on that date.\r\nThe Hackworths also argue that due process requires judicial approval of the forfeiture.Â  Citing United States v. Minor, 228 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 2000) and United States v. Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195 (10th Cir. 2001), the Hackworths contend that no forfeiture occurred because there was not a forfeiture hearing.Â  However, these federal cases are distinguishable because Edman consented to forfeit the cash and thus had knowledge of the forfeiture when it occurred, whereas the forfeitures in the federal cases were involuntary and the hearing served as notice to the defendants.Â  Even if due process requires such a hearing, we need not address this claim because the Hackworths neglected to demand such a hearing and did not challenge the voluntary forfeiture within the two-year statute of limitations.Â  In fact, the Hackworths failed to assert their claims for over four and one half years.Â  \r\nNotably, Edman agreed to forfeit his gambling proceeds in exchange for his plea to a lesser charge, all charges against him and his wife being nol prossed, and the return of $14,000.Â  Edman and Debbie enjoyed the full benefit of that agreement and cannot now bring suit to recover the money.Â  \r\nThe Hackworths failed to provide evidence that would tend to support their position.Â  All of the evidence presented to the trial judge showed the Hackworths were aware of the moneyâ€™s forfeiture.Â  Therefore, the trial court was justified in granting summary judgment.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, Â and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] South Carolina Code Ann. Â§16-19-80 (2005) states â€œ[a]ll and every sum or sums of money staked, betted or pending on the event of any such game or games as aforesaid are hereby declared to be forfeited.â€Â  The statute does not provide a process for law enforcement to follow with forfeited money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4175","title":"Brannon v.

Michael Spivey, of Mauldin, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  On appeal, Palmetto Bank contends the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in its favor on Robert and Kimberly Brannonâ€™s causes of action for breach of contract and conversion.Â  In the alternative, Palmetto Bank contends the trial court erred in directing a verdict against Palmetto Bank on the Brannonsâ€™ breach of contract claim rather than submitting the issue to the jury.Â  Additionally, Palmetto Bank argues the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider evidence of speculative damages.Â Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 22, 2002, the Brannons bought a house out of foreclosure from Palmetto Bank.Â  Two closings occurred in order to finalize this transaction.Â  The first closing was on a 90-day note for the purpose of giving the Brannons time to sell their former house.Â  The closing held on January 22, 2002, was to refinance the original 90-day note for $155,000.00 plus $5,000.00 in interest charged during the 90-day period by Palmetto Bank.Â  The Brannonsâ€™ monetary obligation to Palmetto Bank was secured by a mortgage lien on the residence being purchased.Â  \r\nThe mortgage agreement required the Brannons to keep the house insured for its full insurable value and required the insurance be payable to Palmetto Bank as a loss payee.Â  Pursuant to the mortgage, the Brannons also assigned to Palmetto Bank â€œthe right to collect and receive any indemnity payment otherwise owed to [the Brannons] upon any policy of insurance insuring any portion of the property, regardless of whether [Palmetto Bank] is named in such policy as a person entitled to collect upon the same.â€Â  \r\nOn February 19, 2002, the Brannonsâ€™ home was destroyed by fire.Â  An insurance check was issued by the carrier for $185,850.00 and was made payable to the Brannons, Palmetto Bank, and the builders replacing the Brannonsâ€™ home.Â  Mrs. Brannon took the check to Palmetto Bank, which advised her to open a general deposit account into which most of the insurance proceeds were deposited.Â  Palmetto Bank issued a check to Mrs. Brannon for $25,000 so she could pay her builders.Â  \r\nOn the same day the general deposit account was opened, a hold was placed on the account so that the insurance proceeds could not be withdrawn.Â  Two days later, Palmetto Bank withdrew the sum of $160,257.78 from the deposit account and paid off the mortgage debt.Â  Mrs. Brannon later went to Palmetto Bank to withdraw more money in order to pay her builders when she discovered the mortgage had been paid off and the deposit account was virtually empty.Â  The Brannons then had to receive new financing for the home they were building.Â  Apparently, the Brannons had a history of bad credit which created problems with the financing.Â  Eventually they received financing, but at a much higher interest rate than what they had with the previous mortgage.Â  When the Brannons learned that Palmetto Bank had used the deposit account to satisfy the mortgage debt, this litigation ensued.Â  \r\nAt trial, testimony showed the Brannons were aware there was a possibility that the insurance proceeds could be used to pay off the mortgage debt.Â  Palmetto Bank explained that this procedure is meant to be beneficial for both the lender and the borrower.Â  It is beneficial to the borrower because when the existing loan gets paid off, the borrower under the new construction loan pays interest only on the amount that has been advanced rather than the full principal amount of the existing loan.Â  It is beneficial to the lender because, after the fire has destroyed the house, the lenderâ€™s only collateral is the vacant lot.Â  \r\nThe trial court found, as a matter of law, Palmetto Bank was liable to the Brannons for breach of contract.Â  The determination of damages owed on the breach of contract claim and the liability and damages owed on the conversion claim were submitted to the jury.Â  Subsequently, the jury found Palmetto Bank liable on the conversion cause of action and awarded damages in the amount of $133,000.Â  Palmetto Bank filed motions seeking a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial, which were denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995); Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the jury.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).Â  In reviewing a grant of a directed verdict, the appellate court should not ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.Â  Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 295-96, 504 S.E.2d 347, 350 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In essence, the court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party â€œwould be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict on Breach of Contract (Mortgage and Deposit Agreement) Cause of Action \r\nPalmetto Bank contends the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in its favor on the Brannonsâ€™ breach of contract cause of action.Â  In the alternative, Palmetto Bank asserts it was error to direct a verdict in favor of the Brannons and in failing to submit the issue to the jury.Â  We agree the court erred in not directing a verdict for Palmetto Bank on the breach of contract cause of action.Â  \r\nParagraph 3 of the mortgage agreement gives Palmetto Bank four options in dealing with the insurance proceeds:Â  \r\n\r\nAny indemnity payment received by [Palmetto Bank] from any such policy of insurance may, at the option of [Palmetto Bank], (i) be applied by [Palmetto Bank] to payment of any sum secured by this Mortgage in such order as [Palmetto Bank] may determine or (ii) be applied in a manner determined by [Palmetto Bank] to the replacement, repair or restoration of the portion of the Property damaged or destroyed or (iii) be released to [the Brannons] upon such conditions as [Palmetto Bank] may determine or (iv) be used for any combination of the foregoing purposes.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court found as a matter of law that Palmetto Bankâ€™s deposit of a portion of the insurance proceeds into the deposit account constituted an unconditional â€œreleaseâ€ of those proceeds under paragraph 3(iii) of the Mortgage.Â  The trial court further found:Â  (1) once Palmetto Bank had chosen this option under paragraph 3(iii), it had no right of set-off against the deposit account to satisfy the Mortgage debt; and (2) in setting off against the deposit account, Palmetto Bank became liable to the Brannons as a matter of law for breach of contract.Â  \r\nThe Brannons claim Palmetto Bank unconditionally released the insurance proceeds to them and cannot now revoke the release.Â  â€œReleaseâ€ is defined as â€œthe act of giving up a right or claim to the person against whom it could have been enforced.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1292 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Â Â While it is true Palmetto Bank may have released a portion of the insurance proceeds to the Brannons, the remaining money was placed in a general deposit account.Â  The agreement pertaining to the deposit account contained a paragraph entitled â€œSet-Offâ€ which gave Palmetto Bank the specific right, without prior notice to the Brannons, to â€œset-off the funds in this account against any due and payable debt owed . . . .â€Â  By placing the funds into a deposit account with a set-off provision, Palmetto Bank was not releasing its right or claim to the insurance proceeds.Â  Because both parties retained control over the proceeds placed in the deposit account, the release cannot be seen as absolute.Â  To come to the conclusion of the trial court, a release must have been a complete and total release.Â Â  \r\nOption (iv) of the mortgage agreement gave Palmetto Bank the ability to choose any of the other three options in any combination it wished.Â  Palmetto Bank chose to release a portion of the proceeds and pay off the mortgage with the remainder.Â  Pursuant to the mortgage agreement, Palmetto Bank was within its rights to do so.Â  See MGC Mgmt. of Charleston, Inc. v. Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 548, 520 S.E.2d 820, 823 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating court must construe contract in a way â€œwhich will give effect to the whole instrument and each of its various partsâ€).Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in Palmetto Bankâ€™s favor concerning the breach of contract issue.[1]Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict on Conversion Cause of Action \r\nPalmetto Bank contends the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in its favor on the Brannonsâ€™ conversion cause of action.Â  We agree. \r\nâ€œConversion is the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of the condition or the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.â€Â  Crane v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 313 S.C. 70, 73, 437 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1993).Â  â€œConversion may arise by some illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of anotherâ€™s personal property.â€Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003). â€œConversion is a wrongful act which emanates by either a wrongful taking or wrongful detention.â€ Â Id.\r\nAs a matter of law, Palmetto Bank is not liable for conversion of the insurance proceeds because its use of the funds was not an unauthorized taking as Palmetto Bank had a legal right to the funds.Â  In fact, the case of Richardsonâ€™s Rests., Inc. v. The Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 304 S.C. 289, 294, 403 S.E.2d 669, 672 (Ct. App. 1991), states that a bank cannot be liable for conversion of funds deposited into a payroll account because the deposits â€œbecome part of the [b]ankâ€™s general account against which [the depositorâ€™s] account received a credit.â€Â  This Court went on the say this is true, â€œeven though [the depositor] intended to use the account for a particular purpose.â€Â  Id. at 295, 304 S.E.2d at 672. Â This position is only bolstered by the right of set-off pursuant to the deposit agreement, as discussed above.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of Palmetto Bank on the issue of conversion. \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Evidence of Speculative Damages \r\nPalmetto Bank contends the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider evidence of speculative damages.Â  Because we reverse on the two previous issues, we need not reach the issue of speculative damages.Â  See \r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (An appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive.).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED. [2]\r\nGOOLSBY, Â and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Palmetto Bank also contends the trial court erred in stating Palmetto Bank waived its right to apply the insurance proceeds to the outstanding mortgage debt by placing the funds in a deposit account.Â  However, the trial court did not make the finding Palmetto Bank waived its rights to the insurance proceeds.Â  However, had the trial court come to such a conclusion, it would have been in error.Â  â€œWaiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right.â€Â  Mailsource, LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs., Inc., 356 S.C. 370, 375, 588 S.E.2d 639, 641 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  Palmetto Bankâ€™s action did not constitute a waiver as there was clearly no intent on its part to relinquish its rights to the insurance proceeds.Â Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4176","title":"SC Farm Bureau  v.

Dawsey, Sr. (father) and David R. Dawsey, Jr. (son) seeking a determination regarding coverage under a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy.Â  The master in equity found the policy excluded coverage for injuries incurred by the son.Â  The son appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties stipulated to the underlying facts:Â  The father was insured under a Farm Bureau homeownerâ€™s policy.Â  On February 22, 2002, the son drove to the fatherâ€™s home in North Charleston.Â  â€œ[D]uring th[e] visit, there was some hostility.â€Â  The father fired his pistol three times at the tires on the sonâ€™s truck.Â  One of the bullets ricocheted off the driveway and hit the son in the jaw, inflicting substantial injury. Â The son filed a negligence action against the father.Â  The father did not answer the complaint and is in default.Â  Farm Bureau filed this declaratory judgment action.\r\nThe policy provides coverage for bodily injury caused by an occurrence but excludes coverage for injury â€œresulting from intentional acts or directions of you or any insured.Â  The expected or unexpected results or (sic) these acts or directions are not covered.â€Â  The master found the exclusion applied in this case and entered judgment for Farm Bureau.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nBecause declaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable, the\r\nstandard of review depends on the nature of the underlying issues. Â Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Hamin, 368 S.C. 536, 540, 629 S.E.2d 683, 685 (Ct. App. 2006), petition for cert. filed, (S.C. June 16, 2006).Â  When the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage exists under an insurance policy, the action is one at law.Â  Id. Â In an action at law tried without a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are found to be without evidence that reasonably supports those findings. Â Id.Â  When an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to determine if the trial court properly applied the law to the facts. Â In re Estate of Boynton, 355 S.C. 299, 301, 584 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 2003). Â In such a situation, the appellate court does not have to defer to the trial courtâ€™s findings. Â Id. at 301-02, 584 S.E.2d at 155.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe son argues the master erred in construing the policy to exclude coverage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInsurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002).Â  The court must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  Id.Â  Although exclusions in a policy are construed against the insurer, insurers have the right to limit their liability and to impose conditions on their obligations provided they are not in contravention of public policy or a statutory prohibition.Â  B.L.G. Enters. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 535-36, 514 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1999).Â  The court cannot torture the meaning of policy language to extend coverage not intended by the parties.Â  State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Barrett, 340 S.C. 1, 8, 530 S.E.2d 132, 135 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe son argues the South Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s interpretation of the intentional acts exclusions in Miller v. Fidelity-Phoenix Insurance Co., 268 S.C. 72, 231 S.E.2d 701 (1977), and Vermont Mutual Insurance Co. v. Singleton, 316 S.C. 5, 446 S.E.2d 417 (1994), should have been applied in this case.Â  The insurance policies in Miller and Vermont Mutual contained language excluding coverage for damage intentionally caused by the insured.Â  The policies did not specifically exclude coverage for the unintentional consequences of intentional acts.Â  \r\nThe Miller court developed a two-prong test to analyze coverage under an exclusion such as that found in the Miller case.Â  To exclude coverage under the Miller test, the act causing the loss must have been intentional and the consequences must have been intended.Â  Miller, 268 S.C. at 75, 231 S.E.2d at 701 (providing coverage where a child set fire to a home for the excitement of seeing the fire trucks arrive but no intent to damage the home).Â  In Vermont Mutual, the court applied the Miller test, rejecting the insurerâ€™s argument to adopt a more â€œcontemporaryâ€ intentional act analysis.Â  316 S.C. at 7-8, 446 S.E.2d at 419 (providing coverage where a teenager acted in self-defense when he struck another teenager but did not intend the extensive eye injuries inflicted).\r\nThe son argues the policy language in this case excludes coverage for unexpected consequences but does not exclude coverage for unintentional consequences.Â  Thus, the son maintains, the second prong of the Miller test should still apply to provide coverage.Â  The son admits, however, that the terms â€œintendâ€ and â€œexpectâ€ are â€œoften defined synonymously.â€Â  To read the policy in the manner urged by the son would require us to rewrite the policy, rather than interpret it as written.Â  â€œThe judicial function of a court of law is to enforce an insurance contract as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of judicial construction . . . .â€Â  Thompson v. Continental Ins. Cos., 291 S.C. 47, 49, 351 S.E.2d 904, 905 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  We agree with the master that the policy excludes coverage for the sonâ€™s injuries, which were unexpected consequences of the fatherâ€™s intentional act of shooting at the sonâ€™s tire.Â  Therefore, the order on appeal is \r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4177","title":"State v.

Elliott; Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  George Franklin Sosbee, Jr., was convicted of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree and committing a lewd act upon a child.Â  He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole and fifteen years imprisonment, respectively.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in: (1) sentencing him to life without the possibility of parole; and (2) allowing the State to amend an indictment where it changed the nature of the offense.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2003, Sosbee lived with the grandmother of an eight-year-old girl (the victim).Â  In September or October of that year, the victim told her mother and another female adult that a few months prior, Sosbee touched her in her private parts with his hand and tongue and threatened to put her grandparents and aunts in jail if she told anyone.Â  The victim was examined by a physician, but there were no signs of injury.Â  Sosbee was charged with committing a lewd act on a minor and criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree.Â  Because Sosbee had a prior conviction for criminal sexual conduct, second degree, the State served notice that it intended to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.Â  \r\nAt trial, the victim testified Sosbee touched her on her privates with his hand and tongue.Â  On cross-examination, the victim also stated that all of the touching occurred while she was clothed.Â  At the end of the Stateâ€™s case, Sosbee moved for a directed verdict as to both charges, arguing there was no evidence of penetration and any alleged touching could not meet the statutory definition of sexual battery because the victim was wearing clothing and there was no skin-to-skin contact. Â The State moved to amend the criminal sexual conduct with a minor indictment to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree.Â  Sosbee objected to the proposed amendment, and the parties discussed the matter in chambers.Â  The court granted the amendment, and Sosbee noted his objection for the record.Â  Sosbee was convicted of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, and committing a lewd act upon a minor. \r\nDuring sentencing, the State informed the court that Sosbee had a 1993 conviction for criminal sexual conduct, second degree, and a â€œDUI record in 1983, and a criminal domestic violence record in 1995.â€Â  Sosbee objected, arguing the prior criminal sexual conduct conviction should not be used to enhance his sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole because it was an uncounseled guilty plea.Â  The court sentenced Sosbee to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Â  He appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sentencing\r\nSosbee argues the trial court erred in sentencing him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole because assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor was not a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense that would qualify him for the sentence under the â€œtwo strikesâ€ statute.Â  He also argues that the prior conviction should not have been used for sentence enhancement because it was the result of an uncounseled conviction.Â  We disagree. \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Serious Offense\r\nSosbee initially argues the trial court erred in sentencing him to life without the possibility of parole because, although criminal sexual conduct with minors in any degree is a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense in section 17-25-45(C)(1), assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, is not specifically enumerated in the statute.Â  Thus, he argues, it is not a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense.[2]Â  \r\nSosbeeâ€™s argument lacks merit.Â  Section 17-25-45 clearly designates criminal sexual conduct with a minor as a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense.Â  Section 17-25-45 also designates any â€œattempt, for any offense enumerated in this itemâ€ as a most serious offense.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  An assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree is more aptly designated as an â€œattemptâ€ to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  See State v. LaCoste, 347 S.C. 153, 165-66, 553 S.E.2d 464, 471 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAssault is an attempted battery or an â€˜unlawful attempt or offer to commit a violent injury upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete the attempt or offer by a battery.â€™â€ (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 397, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000))); see also 6 Am. Jur. 2d Assault &amp; Battery Â§ 1 (1999) (defining assault as the â€œintentional attempt by a person, by force or violence, to do an injury to the person of another, or as any attempt to commit a battery, or any threatening gesture showing in itself or by words accompanying it an immediate intention, coupled with a present ability, to commit a batteryâ€); Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 109; 123 (7th ed. 1999)(defining assault as an â€œattempt to commit battery, requiring the specific intent to cause physical injury;â€ and defining attempt as â€œan overt act that is done with the intent to commit a crime but that falls short of completing the crimeâ€). \r\nMoreover, in construing these related statutes together, it is clear that the legislature intended this offense to be considered a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense.Â  State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 152-53, 588 S.E.2d 105, 110 (2003) (â€œIn construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect . . . if possible we will construe a statute so as to escape an absurd result and carry the legislative intention into effectâ€).Â  Criminal sexual conduct with a minor is defined in South Carolina Code section 16-3-655.[3]Â  Section 16-3-655 specifically designates the prohibited conduct as criminal sexual conduct in the first degree or criminal sexual conduct in the second degree.Â  Both of these are listed as most serious offenses in section 17-25-45.Â  As previously stated, section 17-25-45 also designates any attempt to commit these offenses as most serious.Â  See State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 367, 574 S.E.2d 203, 207 (Ct. App. 2002) (noting that where the terms of a statute are clear, the court must apply the plain meaning of those terms, and that the statute should receive a â€œpractical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with purpose, design, and policy of lawmakersâ€); see also State v. Brock, 335 S.C. 267, 271, 516 S.E.2d 212, 214 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing sections 16-3-655 and 16-3-656 to define first-degree assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor).Â  Accordingly, we find no error in designating assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor as a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense. \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncounseled Plea\r\nSosbee next argues the trial court erred in sentencing him to life without the possibility of parole because the prior sentence used to enhance his sentence was the result of an uncounseled guilty plea.Â  \r\nThe use of an uncounseled conviction resulting in a sentence of imprisonment to enhance the punishment in a subsequent conviction violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Â Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 746-47 (1994).Â  However, an uncounseled conviction that does not result in actual imprisonment may be used to enhance a subsequent conviction.Â  Id. at 748-49; State v. Wickenhauser, 309 S.C. 377, 380, 423 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1992) (holding that the use of the defendantâ€™s prior, uncounseled DUI conviction was properly used to enhance his punishment in a subsequent offense where the prior sentence was suspended upon the service of probation and he was not incarcerated); State v. Chance, 304 S.C. 406, 407-08, 405 S.E.2d 375, 376 (1991) (noting that the trial court could enhance the defendantâ€™s DUI conviction with a prior uncounseled guilty plea where the defendant was not actually incarcerated).Â  It is the defendantâ€™s burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a prior conviction is constitutionally defective or invalid when objecting to the use of the prior conviction to enhance punishment of a subsequent conviction.Â  State v. Payne, 332 S.C. 266, 269, 504 S.E.2d 335, 336 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nSosbee testified at his pre-trial competency hearing that he had a prior conviction for â€œanother sexual thing, but it was with an older woman.â€Â  Sosbee stated he pleaded guilty to it because he did not know what was going on, he did not have a lawyer, and the State offered him three years probation.Â  Sosbee stated he completed his probationary term.Â  At the sentencing hearing in the present case, Sosbeeâ€™s attorney objected to the use of this prior sexual assault conviction because it was the result of an uncounseled plea.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  \r\nWe find no merit to Sosbeeâ€™s allegations that his prior uncounseled conviction should not have been used for sentence enhancement.Â  Sosbee did not present any evidence that he was actually incarcerated for the prior, uncounseled conviction.Â  The only evidence before the trial court was Sosbeeâ€™s own testimony that he served only a probationary sentence.Â  Because Sosbee failed to meet his burden of proving the use of his prior, uncounseled plea was unconstitutional and because the record indicates that the prior conviction did not result in imprisonment, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s use of the prior conviction for sentence enhancement.Â  \r\nII.Â  Amendment of the Indictment\r\nSosbee asserts the trial court only ordered the indictment for criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, to be amended to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, pursuant to sections 16-3-655(1) and 16-3-656.Â  Because Sosbeeâ€™s sentencing sheet erroneously indicated that he was charged with assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct, first degree, in violation of section 16-3-656 with a CDR code of 0253, and because the heading inaccurately lists a violation of section 16-3-652 (criminal sexual conduct in the first degree) with a CDR code of 160, Sosbee argues the trial court erred in allowing the amendment of the indictment because it amounted to a â€œbait and switch.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAmendments to an indictment are permissible if: (1) they do not change the nature of the offense; (2) the charge is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment; or (3) the defendant waives presentment to the grand jury and pleads guilty.â€Â  State v. Means, 367 S.C. 374, 385-86, 626 S.E.2d 348, 355 (2006); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (2003) (providing that the trial court may amend the indictment if there is a defect in the indictment or a variance in the charged offense and the proof, as long as the amendment does not change the nature of the offense charged).Â Â  \r\nSosbee asserts the â€œerroneousâ€ listing on his sentencing sheet of the criminal sexual conduct offenses that pertain to adults, instead of the offenses that pertain to minors, changed the nature of the offense charged and was an impermissible amendment.[4]Â  However, it is undisputed that the court ordered the indictment to be amended to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree. Â The court charged the jury on the law of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, and the jury found Sosbee guilty of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  During sentencing, the court specifically indicated Sosbee was being sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the conviction of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree.Â  \r\nSosbee does not allege that the amendment itself changed the nature of the offense charged.Â  Sosbeeâ€™s only complaint is with the â€œerroneousâ€ listing of charges and CDR codes on the sentencing sheet.Â  We agree with the State that the charges and CDR codes listed on the sentencing sheet were scrivenerâ€™s errors.Â  The sentencing sheet is not part of the indictment and does not affect the nature of the offense charged.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAssault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, like any â€œattemptâ€ crime listed in section 17-25-45, is a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense as defined by statute.Â  Sosbeeâ€™s prior uncounseled plea resulted in no jail time, so it was appropriate for the trial court to consider the conviction to enhance his punishment to life without the possibility of parole.Â  Finally, we find the erroneous listing of charges and CDR codes on Sosbeeâ€™s sentencing sheet was a scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the convictions and sentences of Sosbee are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] A person must be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole when convicted of a most serious crime and the person has one or more prior convictions for a most serious crime, or when convicted of a serious crime and the person has two or more convictions for a serious crime.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A), (B) (2003 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Included in the list of â€œmost seriousâ€ offenses is criminal sexual conduct, criminal sexual conduct with minors, and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct, first and second degree.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\n[3] Â§16-3-655 Criminal sexual conduct with minors. \r\n(A) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if: \r\n\r\n  (1) the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim who is less than eleven years of age;Â  or \r\n  (2) the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is less than sixteen years of age and the actor has previously been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or adjudicated delinquent for an offense listed in Section 23&#8209;3&#8209;430(C) or has been ordered to be included in the sex offender registry pursuant to Section 23&#8209;3&#8209;430(D). \r\n\r\nUpon conviction, the actor must be punished by imprisonment for not less than ten years nor more than thirty years, no part of which may be suspended or probation granted. \r\n(B) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years of age. \r\n(C) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is at least fourteen years of age but who is less than sixteen years of age and the actor is in a position of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the victim to submit or is older than the victim. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\n[4]Â  Sosbee does not challenge the trial courtâ€™s order amending the indictment from criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Thus, the amendment is the law of the case.Â  State v. Sampson, 317 S.C. 423, 427, 454 S.E.2d 721, 723 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4178","title":"Query v.

Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This is an action to determine title to real property.Â  Appellant O. Grady Query brought a declaratory judgment action against respondents Carmen Burgess and the State of South Carolina seeking to establish ownership over certain marshlands abutting his Folly Beach property.Â  The master found Query did not own the marshlands.Â  The master concluded the State owned the marshlands based on the â€œpublic trust doctrine.â€Â  Query appeals, and we affirm.[1] \r\nI.\r\nBurgess, a Folly Beach property owner, asked Query, a fellow Folly Beach property owner, for permission to build a dock across certain marshlands abutting Queryâ€™s property so Burgess could access the Folly River.Â  When Query refused, Burgess sought a permit from the Office of Coastal Resource Management to build a dock across the marshlands.Â  In response, Query brought a declaratory judgment action against Burgess and the State[2] seeking to establish title over the marshlands.Â  At trial, Query claimed ownership of the marshlands because the State specifically granted the marshlands to one of his predecessors in title.Â  \r\nQuery introduced a 1696 and 1786 grant (with accompanying plat), which he argued showed the Stateâ€™s intent to grant one of his predecessors in title ownership of the marshlands.Â  Burgess and the State asserted Queryâ€™s evidence failed to rebut the presumption the State held the marshlands in fee simple for the benefit of the public.Â  The master agreed with Burgess and the State and found the State held title to the marshlands in fee simple.Â  Query appealed this finding.Â  \r\nII.\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  â€œTo make this determination we look to the main purpose of the action as determined by the complaint.â€Â  Estate of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 476, 484 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Where, as here, the main purpose of the complaint concerns the determination of title to real property, it is an action at law.Â  Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State, 347 S.C. 96, 101, 552 S.E.2d 778, 781 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988) (â€œThe determination of title to real property is a legal issue.â€)).Â  In an action at law, â€œwe will affirm the masterâ€™s factual findings if there is any evidence in the record which reasonably supports them.â€Â  Id. at 101-02, 552 S.E.2d at 781.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nQuery argues the 1786 grant and accompanying plat evince the Stateâ€™s intent to grant Queryâ€™s predecessor in title ownership over the marshlands.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œ[T]he State holds presumptive title to land below the high water mark.â€Â  McQueen v. S.C. Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119 (2003).Â  When property is bounded by a tidal navigable waterway[3] â€œthe boundary line is the high water mark, in the absence of more specific language showing that it was intended to go below high water mark, and the portion between high and low water mark remains in the State in trust for the benefit of the public.â€Â  State v. Hardee, 259 S.C. 535, 539, 193 S.E.2d 497, 499 (1972).Â  â€œThe State may, however, grant private individuals an ownership interest in tidelands.â€Â  Lowcountry, 347 S.C. at 102, 552 S.E.2d at 781.Â  To establish ownership of tidelands or marshlands, a claimant must show (1) the claimantâ€™s predecessors in title possessed a valid grant, and (2) the grantâ€™s language was sufficient to convey title to land below the high water mark.Â  Id. at 103, 552 S.E.2d at 782.Â  â€œA deed or grant by [the State] is construed strictly in favor of the State and general public and against the grantee.â€Â  Hardee, 259 S.C. at 539, 193 S.E.2d at 499.Â  \r\nThe 1786 grant on which Query relies provides:\r\n\r\n  We have granted, and by these Presents do grant unto the said Martha Samways, her Heirs and Assigns, a Plantation or Tract of Land containing one thousand nine hundred [and] forty Acres being the Surplus contained in a Grant for the Folly Islands heretofore Granted to William Rivers on the [ninth] of September 1696 for seven hundred acres or thereabouts but upon a Resurvey found to contain within the lines of the same two thousand Six hundred and Forty having such Shape, Form and Marks, as are represented by a Plat hereunto annexed, together with all Woods, Trees, Waters, Water-courses, Profits, Commodities, Appurtenances, and Hereditaments, whatsoever thereunto belonging, To have and to hold the said Tract of one Thousand nine hundred [and] forty Acres of Land, and all and singular other the Premises hereby granted unto the said Martha Samways her Heirs and Assigns for ever . . . .\r\n\r\nThe accompanying plat includes the following surveyorâ€™s note:\r\n\r\n  I have caused to be admeasured [and] resurveyed unto Martha Samways . . . an Island situate in the district of Charleston Granted to Wm.

McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 398, 252 S.E.2d 133, 136 (1979) (holding that an exceptionally detailed and mathematically precise plat can rebut the Stateâ€™s presumption of title to marshes).Â  Because there is evidence to support the masterâ€™s findings, his order is \r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  â€œAny person claiming an interest in tidelands . . . may institute an action against [the State] for the purpose of determining the existence of any right, title or interest of such person in and to such tidelands as against the State.â€Â  S.C.

McCall, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\nKathrynÂ  Williams, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Palmetto State Transportation Company and its carrier, Canal Insurance Company (jointly referred to as Palmetto), appeal a circuit court order affirming the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s (Commission) award of benefits to Scott Wilkinsonâ€™s dependents.Â  Palmetto argues the trial court erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s: (1) finding that an employer/employee relationship existed between Palmetto and Scott; (2) denial of a motion to include additional evidence; (3) finding that an occupational disability policy purchased by Scott is a collateral source; (4) denial of a motion to join Zurich American Insurance Company (Zurich), the provider of Scottâ€™s occupational disability policy, as a party defendant; and (5) denying the testimony of Gary Smith, Palmettoâ€™s expert.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 16, 2002, while driving a transfer truck, Scott Wilkinson was involved in a fatal accident in Virginia.Â  Â \r\nScottâ€™s spouse, Lea Ann Wilkinson, contends that during the time of the accident, Scott was an employee of Palmetto.Â  As such, she and the coupleâ€™s son are entitled to death benefits from Palmettoâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation carrier under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Palmetto argues that at the time of his death, Scott was an independent contractor and not an employee; therefore, Lea Ann is not entitled to receive benefits from Palmetto.Â  To support this argument, Palmetto contends in 1998, Scott was hired as an employee, but in May 1999 and again in 2000, the parties signed a contract in which Scott was named as an independent contractor and Palmetto as the carrier. \r\nPalmetto further avers that even if this Court were to find an employer/employee relationship existed, Palmettoâ€™s liability should be offset by any benefits paid to Lea Ann by the occupational disability policy Scott purchased from Zurich.Â  Lea Ann argues this policy is wholly a collateral source; therefore, Palmetto is not entitled to receive any credit from payments made by Zurich.Â  \r\nOn February 27, 2004, the Commissioner found an employer/employee relationship existed between Scott and Palmetto at the time of his death, and Lea Ann and the coupleâ€™s child were entitled to receive death benefits under Palmettoâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation policy.Â  In addition, the Commissioner held that Scottâ€™s occupational disability policy constituted a collateral source.Â  Thus, Palmetto was not entitled to receive credit for benefits paid from that policy, nor could Palmetto receive benefits directly from that policy.Â  \r\nPrior to this ruling, Palmetto filed a motion to add Zurich as an additional party referencing the occupational disability policy purchased by Scott.Â  In addition, Palmetto filed a motion to include additional evidence.Â  The Commissioner denied both motions. \r\nConsequently, Palmetto appealed to the Full Commission, asserting that the Commissioner erred in denying these motions.Â  On September 28, 2004, the Commissionâ€™s Appellate Panel affirmed and adopted the Commissionerâ€™s order.Â  On September 25, 2005, Palmetto appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the Commission.Â  Palmetto now appeals to this Court. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nâ€œAny review of the [C]ommissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Accordingly, we limit review to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95. \r\nâ€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached.â€Â  Lockridge, 344 S.C. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.Â  â€œThe â€˜possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€™â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984)).\r\nHowever, if any factual issue before the Commission involves a jurisdictional question, this Court is not bound by the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact; but it can take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence on that issue.Â  Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, 94, 447 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Employer/employee relationship \r\nPalmetto initially argues the trial court and the Commission erred in concluding that an employer/employee relationship existed between Palmetto and Scott.Â  We disagree. \r\nUnless an employment relationship existed between the parties at the time of the alleged injury, an award cannot be granted.Â  Alewine v. Tobin Quarries, 206 S.C. 103, 109, 33 S.E.2d 81, 83 (1945).Â  Whether such a relationship exists is a jurisdictional question; therefore, this Court can take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995).Â  However, doubts of jurisdiction are to be resolved in favor of inclusion rather than exclusion.Â  Horton v. Baruch, 217 S.C. 48, 56, 59 S.E.2d 545, 548 (1950).Â Â  \r\nPalmetto places great weight on the agreement the parties signed in May 1999 and again in 2000, in which Scott was named as an independent contractor and Palmetto as the carrier.Â  However, Palmetto forgets neither the descriptions of relationships as set forth in the partiesâ€™ contract, nor the language in the contract declaring the parties to be that of independent contractor/carrier is binding on this Court.Â  Kilgore Group Inc. v. S.C. Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 313 S.C. 65, 69, 437 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1993).Â  Rather, the determination of whether the worker is an employee or independent contractor is a fact-specific matter resolved by applying certain established principles.Â  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594 564 S.E.2d 110, 112-13 (2002).\r\nThe test to determine whether a claimant is an employee or an independent contractor is if â€œthe alleged employer has the right and authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.â€Â  S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995) (internal quotes omitted).Â  Four factors determine the right of control. \r\nThey are: (1) direct evidence of right to or exercise of control, (2) method of payment, (3) furnishing of equipment, and (4) right to fire.Â  Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 200, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970).Â  The presence of any one of the factors is sufficient proof of an employer/employee relationship; on the other hand, the absence of any one of the factors is at most mild influential evidence of contractorship.Â  Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703 (2000). \r\nIn analyzing these factors, the Court recognizes that the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act favors the inclusion of employers and employees and not their exclusion.Â  Horton, 217 S.C. at 56, 59 S.E.2d at 548.Â  Â Â With this introduction in mind, we now turn our attention to these four factors. \r\nThe first factor is whether direct evidence exists of the right to, or the actual exercise of, control.Â  If an alleged employer has the right to control and sets out the manner in which the work is to be accomplished, this is direct evidence of an employer/employee relationship.Â  Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 189-90, 165 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1969).Â  Palmetto contends it lacked control over Scott because Scott could refuse loads and consequently worked on his own schedule.Â  We find this argument to be without merit.Â  \r\nPalmetto exercised its control over Scott by requiring Scott to exclusively carry its loads.Â  When Scott carried a load for Palmetto, he was instructed on when and where to pick up the load as well as how and when to deliver the load.Â  Moreover, Palmetto required Scott to apply the company logo to his truck.Â  This is sufficient evidence to prove that Palmetto not only had the right to control Scott but exercised this control.Â  See Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 597-98, 564 S.E.2d 110, 114 (2002) (Cab company had the right of control even when the cab driver could work as little as he wanted, drove the cab in any part of the city he chose, and could set his own schedule.).\r\nThe second factor for consideration is the method of payment; this factor indicates a lack of an employer/employee relationship.Â  Like other employed drivers, Palmetto paid Scott by the mile.Â  However, unlike other employed drivers, Scottâ€™s rate per mile was higher, and Palmetto made no deductions for either social security or income taxes.Â  Moreover, unlike other employed drivers, Scott had to pay various expenses such as fuel costs, service fees, and toll fees.Â  These facts indicate that Scott was not paid like other employed drivers. \r\nThe third factor is whether Palmetto furnished Scottâ€™s equipment; this factor indicates that Scott was an employee.Â  Although Scott purchased his own tractor, Palmetto supplied the trailer.Â  In addition, Palmetto prohibited Scott from using the tractor to carry loads for any other company.Â  Moreover, Scott drove a truck bearing the Palmetto logo. \r\nLike all of Palmettoâ€™s drivers, Palmetto required Scott to carry a global positioning system (GPS) in his truck.Â  Palmettoâ€™s safety and maintenance director, Dennis Mersereau, testified that by employing this system, Palmetto would be able to determine Scottâ€™s location anytime.Â  These facts show that Palmetto supplied equipment to Scott. \r\nThe final factor is Palmettoâ€™s right to fire, which indicates that Scott was not an independent contractor.Â  The unconditional power to terminate the alleged employer/employee relationship, without liability, is consistent with an employer/employee relationship.Â  Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 201, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970).Â  There were many circumstances in which Palmetto could fire Scott. \r\nFor example, Mr. Mersereau testified Scott was required to work exclusively for Palmetto, and if he were to transport loads for another company, he would be terminated.Â  Mr. Mersereau also testified that even though Scott could refuse loads, if he refused too many, Scott would be terminated. Â Palmetto could end the relationship if it did not approve of the manner in which Scott performed his work.Â  Additionally, Scott, like any other employee, could terminate his position with Palmetto at will.Â  \r\nKeeping in mind the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act favors the inclusion of employers and employees and not their exclusion, and the presence of any one of the factors is sufficient proof of an employer/employee relationship, we hold an employer/employee relationship existed between Scott and Palmetto. \r\nB. Motion to include additional evidence\r\nPalmetto next argues the Commission and the trial court erred by not allowing Palmetto to supplement the record with additional evidence.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nFor additional evidence to be introduced, the moving party must establish that the additional evidence sought to be introduced â€œwas not known to the moving party at the time of the first hearing, [or] by reasonable diligence the new evidence could not have been secured, and the discovery of the new evidence is being brought to attention of the Commission immediately upon its discovery.â€Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-707 (Supp. 2005).Â  Â Additionally, the admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the Commission. Â Holcombe v. Dan River Mills/Woodside Div., 286 S.C. 223, 225-26, 333 S.E.2d 338, 340 (Ct. App. 1985). \r\nBy motion, Palmetto sought to introduce into the record its own additional business records and an affidavit from Mr. Mersereau.Â  \r\nAlthough the hearing in this matter occurred during August 2003, the business records were created during or before May 2002.Â  Thus, the records were in existence prior to the hearing and could have been discovered prior to the hearing with due diligence.Â  Likewise, Mr. Mersereauâ€™s affidavit is exclusively based on evidence that existed prior to the hearing and that could have been discovered and submitted prior to the hearing with due diligence. \r\nAdditionally, the records sought to be admitted were subpoenaed by the claimant during June 2002, and Palmetto failed to produce the records claiming that they did not exist.Â  Based on Palmettoâ€™s failure the trial court concluded that allowing the untimely inclusion of the records would prejudice the claimant.Â  We agree. Â \r\nC. Occupational disability policy \r\nPalmetto next argues the Commission and the trial court erred in holding Scottâ€™s occupational disability policy was a collateral source. Â We disagree. \r\nPalmetto argues it should receive credit for any payments made to Lea Ann by the occupational disability policy Scott purchased through Zurich.Â  Lea Ann argues the Zurich policy is a wholly collateral source; therefore, Palmetto should not be able to receive credit for payments made by Zurich. \r\nThe collateral source rule states that compensation from an independent source will not reduce the payment for which another party is liable to the injured party.Â  Atkinson v. Orkin Extermination Co., Inc., 361 S.C. 156, 172, 604 S.E.2d 385, 393 (2004).Â  Unfortunately, an exhaustive search of South Carolina law has failed to yield an answer to whether an occupational disability policy would be considered a collateral source.Â  However, North Carolina courts have addressed this issue.Â  Our courts give great weight to North Carolinaâ€™s decisions in workersâ€™ compensation cases because South Carolina adopted large portions of North Carolinaâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation legislation.Â  Munn v. Nucor Steel, Div. of Nucor Corp., 336 S.C. 28, 31, Â 518 S.E.2d 289, 290 (Ct. App. 1999); See Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr. Center, 343 S.C. 487, 496-97, 541 S.E.2d 526, 530 (2001). \r\nNorth Carolina courts have ruled that an employer is entitled to receive credit only for any payments made by the employer to the injured employee which were not payable when made. Â Jenkins v. Piedmont Aviation Servs., 557 S.E.2d 104, 108-109 (N.C. App. 2001) (emphasis added).Â  This credit is inapplicable to\r\nall other payments the employee may receive from outside sources. Â Id.\r\nIt is undisputed that Scott paid all of the premiums for the Zurich policy, and Palmetto did not contribute in any way to the premiums.Â  Therefore, Palmetto should not receive any credit for payments made by Zurich. \r\nAdditionally, it flies in the face of equity to grant Palmetto a windfall benefit by allowing it to take credit against any sums Lea Ann received from other sources.Â  This is especially true in light of the fact that Scott paid all the premiums, and Palmetto contributed in no way to the Zurich policy. Â \r\nFor these reasons, we hold that Palmetto is not entitled to receive credit for any payments made by Zurich. \r\nD. Motion to join Zurich\r\nPalmetto next contends the Commission and the trial court erred in not allowing it to add Zurich as a party defendant.Â  Palmetto argues two alternative grounds for this contention.Â  First, the Zurich policy was a workersâ€™ compensation policy, and second, Zurich would reimburse Palmetto for any benefits Palmetto paid.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe Zurich policy states: â€œThis Policy is not intended to provide coverage for Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits.â€Â  As noted above, the Zurich policy was an outside source.Â  As such, Palmetto is not entitled to receive any reimbursement for payments made by Zurich. \r\nIn support of its second contention, Palmetto places great weight on a clause in Zurichâ€™s policy, which would allow Palmetto to receive benefits from Zurich if Palmetto is determined liable for workersâ€™ compensation benefits[1].Â  However, this clause has no binding effect on this Court. \r\nThe parties are free to contract as they wish, but this freedom is not absolute.Â  Statutory provisions that are applicable to a contract become part of that contract.Â  Boyd v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 316, 319, 195 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1973).Â  If a contract provision contravenes an applicable statute, that provision is invalid, and the statute prevails.Â  Id.  \r\nUnder the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, an agreement between an employee and employer for the employee to pay any portion of premiums for benefits required by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is invalid.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-5-200 (1976).Â  Additionally, no contract between an employee and employer or an employee and a third party can operate to relieve the obligations created under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-610 (1976). \r\nAs already established, Scott was an employee of Palmetto at the time of his death, and any credit received by Palmetto from the Zurich policy, for which Scott alone paid the premiums would have the effect of replacing the workersâ€™ compensation benefits Palmetto is required to pay under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Permitting Palmetto to recover these payments would be contrary to South Carolina law, and any provision of the Zurich policy that would allow such payment would violate the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and therefore would be void. \r\nThe Zurich policy has no bearing on the workersâ€™ compensation claims asserted by Scottâ€™s dependents. Â As such, it is unnecessary to add Zurich as a party defendant because it has no interest in the matter. \r\nE. Testimony of Gary Smith, Palmettoâ€™s expert\r\nPalmettoâ€™s final argument is that the Commission and the trial court erred in not allowing the testimony of Gary Smith.Â  We disagree.\r\nPalmetto sought to introduce Smithâ€™s testimony to show the construction, purpose, and effect of the Zurich policy.Â  Specifically, through Smith, Palmetto wished to show that if Palmetto is liable for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, the Zurich policy would reimburse Palmetto. \r\nSmithâ€™s testimony was unnecessary because the Zurich policy has no effect on the workersâ€™ compensation benefits sought, and the policy provides no credit or benefits to Palmetto.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in excluding Smithâ€™s testimony. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]Â \r\nGOOLSBY and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The clause states: â€œIf a Covered person is determined by a court of law . . . to be covered under workersâ€™ compensation for a Covered Loss, any benefits for which the Covered person is eligible are payable to the person who was determined to be the Covered Personâ€™s employer. . . .â€Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4180","title":"Holcombe-Burdette v.

Burdette (Testator) requires a devisee to be living at the time the trust terminates in order to inherit trust assets.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTestator died in 1965 leaving his Will dated February 8, 1955.Â  Testator was predeceased by his wife, Ella, and survived by his five children: Bennie E. Burdette; Helen B. Peters; Bertha B. Bozeman; Claude M. Burdette; and Zelene B. Adams.Â Â Â  \r\nUnder Item VIII of his Will, Testator bequeathed the residue of his estate in trust, naming The Farmerâ€™s Bank of Simpsonville (now Bank of America) and Bertha B. Bozeman as co-trustees.Â  Item VIII(2)(c) directs the trustees, in the event of the death of Testatorâ€™s wife, to apply the entire balance of Testatorâ€™s residuary estate to the benefit of his daughter, Helen B. Peters, for her lifetime.Â  Item VIII(2)(d) provides that upon the death of Peters and when her youngest natural child reaches the age of twenty-one, the trust shall cease and be divided as follows: \r\n\r\nOne share to the natural child or children per stirpes of my daughter, Helen B. Peters; one share to each of my children, Claude M. Burdette, Zelene B. Adams and Bertha B. Bozeman, living at the time of the termination of said trust.Â  If either of my said three children shall have died before the termination of this trust, leaving a child or children surviving, the child or children of said deceased child of mine shall take per stirpes the share of the corpus and accumulated net income of which his, her or their parent would have taken if living.Â  If any of my four children Helen B. Peters, Claude M. Burdette, Zelene B. Adams and Bertha B. Bozeman, should die without leaving a surviving child or children, the share of the corpus and accumulated net income which the child or children of Helen B. Peters, and the share which my other child or children would have taken if living, Â shall be divided among my surviving children, Claude M. Burdette, Zelene B. Adams, and Bertha B. Bozeman, and the child or children per stirpes of any of my said three deceased children who shall have died leaving a surviving child or children, as the case may be. \r\n\r\nPeters died on July 3, 2003 and was survived by one son who was over the age of twenty-one.Â  Claude M. Burdette died in 1970, predeceasing Peters, but was survived by two sons, one of whom was Charles A. Burdette.Â  Charles A. Burdette also predeceased Peters and was not living at the time the trust terminated.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn December 2003, Personal Representative filed this action requesting the probate court to find, pursuant to Item VIII (2)(d), Charles A. Burdette had a vested remainder interest in the Trust based on having survived his father, Claude M. Burdette.Â  The probate court held the plain language of Testatorâ€™s Will â€œclearly articulates the Settlorâ€™s intention that the assets pass lineally, per stirpes, to heirs surviving Helen B. Peters and living at the time of Trust termination, or to their surviving children.â€Â  On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the ruling of the probate court. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate courtâ€™s determination of the standard of review for matters originating in the probate court is controlled by whether the cause of action is at law or in equity.Â  Golini v. Bolton, 326 S.C. 333, 338, 482 S.E.2d 784, 787 (Ct. App. 1997); Univ. of S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274, 617 S.E.2d 135, 137 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nThe construction of a will is an action at law.Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley, 365 S.C. 157, 165, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005); Estate of Stevens v. Lutch, 365 S.C. 427, 430, 617 S.E.2d 736, 737 (Ct. App. 2005); Nationsbank of S.C. v. Greenwood, 321 S.C. 386, 392, 468 S.E.2d 658, 662 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œOn appeal from an action at law that was tried without a jury, the appellate court can correct errors of law, but the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Blackmon v. Weaver, 366 S.C. 245, 249, 621 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Because Personal Representative has admitted that no facts are in dispute in this case, this court can review conclusions of law based on those facts.Â  See Coakley v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 363 S.C. 147, 152, 609 S.E.2d 537, 540 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â  Â \r\nIn the case sub judice, a trust is encapsulated within the four corners of a will.Â  An action to construe or interpret a testamentary trust is equitable in nature.Â  Waddell v. Kahdy, 309 S.C. 1, 4-5, 419 S.E.2d 783, 785-86 (1992).Â  A declaration of rights arising in the administration of a trust generally lies in equity.Â  See First Citizens Bank and Trust Co. of S.C. v. Hucks, 305 S.C. 296, 298, 408 S.E.2d 222, 223 (1991).\r\nIt is not necessary for this Court to resolve the obvious conundrum as to whether the standard of review in this case is at law or in equity.Â  Applying either standard, the result will be the same. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPersonal Representative argues the trial court erred in finding any interest Charles A. Burdette had in the residuary of Testatorâ€™s estate (to be distributed at the dissolution of the trust) was conditioned upon Charles A. Burdette surviving Helen B. Peters.Â  Specifically, Personal Representative avers Charles A. Burdetteâ€™s interest in the Trust assets vested at the time Claude M. Burdette died in 1970 because no condition precedent remainedâ€”the only condition precedent was that Charles survive his father, Claude.Â  It is Personal Representativeâ€™s contention that, while Testator intended to require that his three named children survive their sister Helen in order to take a share of the Trust principal at her death, he did not desire this same requirement be placed on their children, i.e. his grandchildren.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n1. Construction of Wills\r\nThe paramount rule of will construction is to determine and give effect to the testatorâ€™s intent. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-102(b)(2) (â€œThe underlying purposes and policies of this Code are . . . (2) to discover and make effective the intent of a decedent in the distribution of his property.â€); Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley, 365 S.C. 157, 165, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005); Bob Jones Univ. v. Strandell, 344 S.C. 224, 230, 543 S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. App. 2001); Matter of Clark, 308 S.C. 328, 330, 417 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1992) (stating the cardinal rule of will construction, as well as the primary inquiry of the appellate court, is the determination of the testatorâ€™s intent).Â  â€œ[A] testatorâ€™s intention, as expressed in his will, governs the construction of it if not in conflict with law or public policy . . . .â€ Â In re Estate of Prioleau, 361 S.C. 627, 631, 606 S.E.2d 769, 772 (2004); White v. White, 241 S.C. 181, 185, 127 S.E.2d 627, 629 (1962).Â  In construing the provisions of a will, every effort must be made to determine and carry out the intentions of the testator.Â  Prioleau, 361 S.C. at 631, 606 S.E.2d at 772; Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank v. Cleveland, 200 S.C. 373, 377, 20 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1942).Â  Indeed, â€œ[t]he rules of construction are subservient to the primary consideration of ascertaining what the testator meant by the terms used in the written instrument itself . . . .â€Â  Kemp v. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 34, 594 S.E.2d 845, 849 (2004); Allison v. Wilson, 306 S.C. 274, 278, 411 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1991); see also Black v. Gettys, 238 S.C. 167, 173, 119 S.E.2d 660, 662-63 (1961) (stating while there are certain rules of construction to be followed in seeking the intention of the testator, they are all subservient to the paramount consideration of determining what the testator meant by the terms used).Â  \r\nIn determining the intent of the deceased, a court must always look first to the language of the will itself.Â  Pate v. Ford, 297 S.C. 294, 299, 376 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1989); Bob Jones Univ., 344 S.C. at 230, 543 S.E.2d at 254 (â€œIn construing a will, a courtâ€™s first reference is always to the willâ€™s language itself.â€).Â  The primary rule of ascertaining intent is that â€œ[r]esort is first to be had to the instrumentâ€™s language, and if such is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, such language determines the force and effect of the instrument.â€Â  Chiles v. Chiles, 270 S.C. 379, 383-84, 242 S.E.2d 426, 429 (1978) (quoting Superior Auto Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 263, 199 S.E.2d 719, 722 (1973)).Â  The court must be guided by the words which the testator has used, reading them in the light of established principles of law.Â  White, 241 S.C. at 186, 127 S.E.2d at 629.Â  \r\nâ€œIn construing the language of a will, the appellate court must give words their ordinary, plain meaning unless it is clear the testator intended a different sense, or unless such a meaning would lead to an inconsistency with the testatorâ€™s declared intention.â€ Â Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 165, 616 S.E.2d at 714-15; accord Bob Jones Univ., 344 S.C. at 230, 543 S.E.2d at 254.Â  â€œA will must be read in the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words employed, unless some obvious absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency with the declared intention of the testator, as abstracted from the whole will, should follow from such construction.â€Â  Matter of Clark, 308 S.C. at 330, 417 S.E.2d at 857; accord Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 165, 616 S.E.2d at 715; Love v. Love, 208 S.C. 363, 369, 38 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1946).Â  Only when a willâ€™s terms or provisions are equivocal, may the court resort to extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity.Â  In re Estate of Hyman, 362 S.C. 20, 26, 606 S.E.2d 205, 207 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nIn assigning meaning to the words used in the will and ascertaining the intent of the testator, the court must view the will as a whole.Â  See Pate, 297 S.C. at 299, 376 S.E.2d at 778.Â  Intent is to be ascertained upon consideration of the entire will.Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 165, 616 S.E.2d at 714;Â  Prioleau, 361 S.C. at 631, 606 S.E.2d at 772.Â  â€œ[E]ach item of a will must be considered in relation to the other portion.â€Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 166, 616 S.E.2d at 715; Allison, 306 S.C. at 278, 411 S.E.2d at 435. Â â€œA court may not consider the will piecemeal, but must give due weight to all its language and provisions, giving effect to every part when, under a reasonable interpretation, all the provisions may be harmonized with each other and with the will as a whole.â€ Â Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 166, 616 S.E.2d at 715 (citations omitted).Â  Arriving at the intent of the testator requires that every item be considered in relation to the other portions of the will.Â  Gettys, 238 S.C. at 174, 119 S.E.2d at 663.Â  â€œAn interpretation that fits into the whole scheme or plan of the will is most likely to be the correct interpretation of the intent of the testator.â€Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 166, 616 S.E.2d at 715; accord Lemmon v. Wilson, 204 S.C. 50, 69, 28 S.E.2d 792, 800 (1944).\r\n2. Construction of Trusts\r\nâ€œThe rules of construction that apply in this State to the interpretation of and disposition of property by will also apply as appropriate to the interpretation of the terms of a trust and the disposition of the trust property.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 62-7-112 (2005 Act No. 66, Â§ 1, effective January 1, 2006). \r\nThe primary consideration in interpreting and construing a testamentary trust is to discern the testatorâ€™s intent. Â Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 166, 616 S.E.2d at 715; Bowles v. Bradley, 319 S.C. 377, 380, 461 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1995) (â€œThe primary consideration in construing a trust is to discern the settlorâ€™s intent.â€). Â Indeed, â€œthe law relating to discerning the drafterâ€™s intent is identical for wills and trusts.â€Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 166, 616 S.E.2d at 715 (citing All Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church, 358 S.C. 209, 224 n. 10, 595 S.E.2d 253, 262 n. 10 (Ct. App. 2004)). In ascertaining a settlorâ€™s intent, if the language of the trust instrument is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, such language determines the force and the effect of the instrument. Chiles v. Chiles, 270 S.C. 379, 384, 242 S.E.2d 426, 429 (1978); see also Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 615 S.E.2d 465 (Ct. App. 2005) (affirming trial courtâ€™s construction of testamentary trust language relating to trusteeâ€™s discretionary powers); Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 617 S.E.2d 135 (construing the plain language of trust specifically to authorize trustee to enter into settlements); Estate of Stevens v. Lutch, 365 S.C. 427, 617 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2005) (relying on the trust language as most persuasive of settlorâ€™s intent regarding discretionary power of trustee). \r\nâ€œ[C]onstruction depends upon the trustorâ€™s intent at the time of execution as shown by the face of the document and not on any secret wishes, desires or thoughts after the event.â€Â  Chiles, 270 S.C. at 384, 242 S.E.2d at 429 (quoting Brock v. Hall, 33 Cal.2d 885, 206 P.2d 360 (1949)). Extrinsic evidence is not admissible to alter the plain language of a trust instrument.Â  Bowles, 319 S.C. at 380, 461 S.E.2d at 813.\r\n3. VestingÂ  \r\nThe word â€œvestâ€ can be employed to refer to either â€œa vesting in interestâ€ or â€œa vesting in possession.â€Â  Loadholt v. Harter, 260 S.C. 176, 181, 194 S.E.2d 880, 883 (1973).Â  As the latter meaning would have no further effect than if the grantor had declared the property was â€œto and be possessed byâ€ the remaindermen upon the death of Helen (and when her youngest child reaches twenty-one years of age), the former use of the term, in the sense of â€œto vest in interest,â€ is unequivocally the meaning of term in the case sub judice.Â  See id. \r\nOur supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\nA vested remainder is one the owner of which has the present capacity of taking the seisin in case the particular estate were to determine. But no degree of uncertainty as to the remaindermanâ€™s ever enjoying his remainder will render it contingent, provided he has by the limitation a present absolute right to enjoy the estate the instant the prior estate should determine.\r\nWhile a contingent remainder is one limited to take effect either to a dubious and uncertain person or upon a dubious and uncertain event, it does not follow that every remainder which is subject to a contingency or a condition is therefore a contingent remainder. The condition may be precedent or it may be subsequent if the former, the remainder is contingent; if the latter, it is vested, though it may be divested by the happening of the condition.\r\n\r\nPeoples Nat. Bank of Greenville v. Hable, 243 S.C. 502, 510, 134 S.E.2d 763, 766 (1964) (internal quotations omitted).\r\nIt is not the uncertainty of enjoyment in the future, but the uncertainty of the right to that enjoyment which marks the difference between a vested and a contingent interest.Â  Loadholt, 260 S.C. at 182, 194 S.E.2d at 883 (quoting Walker v. Alverson, 87 S.C. 55, 59, 68 S.E.2d 966, 969 (1910)).\r\n4. ApplicationÂ  \r\nThe plain language of the Trust articulates Testatorâ€™s clear intention to pass the Trust assets to heirs living at the time the Trust terminates.Â  It is true, as Personal Representative contends, that the law favors the vesting of estates at the earliest time possible.Â  Gettys, 238 S.C. at 177, 119 S.E.2d at 664-65; Walker, 87 S.C. at 57-58, 68 S.E. at 967.Â  The Trust provides that in the event any of Testatorâ€™s â€œthree children shall have died before the termination of this trust, leaving a child or children surviving, the child or children of said deceased child of mine shall take per stirpes the share of the corpus and accumulated net income of which his, her or their parent would have taken if living.â€ (emphasis added).Â  This language indicates Testator only desired a grandchild to take if he or she were â€œsurvivingâ€ at the time of the termination of the trust. Therefore, the trial court did not err in holding Charles A. Burdetteâ€™s interest in the Trust assets was conditioned upon his surviving Peters.Â  \r\nWhile a remainder may vest in title before the life estate ends (i.e. â€œdeterminesâ€) at the death of the life tenant, any interest the grandchildren had in the trust property did not vest until the time of Helenâ€™s death.Â  The Trust specifically stated: â€œUpon the death of my daughter, Helen B. Peters [or if later, upon her youngest child reaching the age of twenty-one], the trust herein created in . . . shall cease and determine . . .â€ (emphasis added). Â It was at this point in time, when the trust terminated, that Testator intended vesting to occur.\r\nOur interpretation is further substantiated by consideration of the entire Will and Trust.Â  Throughout these documents, Testator evidences a common scheme of devising assets only to persons surviving him or surviving prior devisees.Â  Testator bequeathed his home to his wife, â€œ[i]f she shall survive me,â€ gave his daughter, Zelene B. Adams, $3,500 for running his business â€œif she shall survive me,â€ and left a vacant lot to his son, Bennie E. Burdette, for life â€œif he shall survive me . . . .â€Â  Upon Bennie E. Burdetteâ€™s death, the vacant lot was directed to pass to Bennie E. Burdetteâ€™s wife, for life, â€œif she be then living.â€Â  Similarly, Testator left Peters a house, for her natural life, â€œif she shall survive meâ€ and instructed that the house shall pass to Petersâ€™ son if he survives until the age of twenty-five and is living at the time of Petersâ€™ death.Â  These other devises indicate Testatorâ€™s general intent to leave assets to heirs living at the time a bequest passes.Â  Thus, in viewing the passage at issue in light of the Will and Trust as a whole, the clear intent of the Testator under Item VIII(2)(d) is to require a devisee be alive at the time of the termination of the Trust in order to take an interest in the Trust assets.\r\nWe acknowledge the Testatorâ€™s direct requirement of survivorship in other portions of the Will and Trust could arguably provide support for finding that Testator knew how to specifically require survivorship, and the failure to do so under Item VIII, indicates survivorship is not obligatory.Â  See Thomson v. Russell, 131 S.C. 529, 538-39, 128 S.E. 421, 422 (1924) (holding creation of life estate in one part of will demonstrates knowledge of requirements and that intention in other part is to not create life estate).Â  We read the Trust as clearly requiring survivorship.Â  Further, the circumstances in this case do not lead to interpreting the Trust as the court did in Thompson.Â  We note that â€œwhile precedent is helpful at times,\r\nâ€˜no will has a brother,â€™â€ and â€œ[a] court may find little guidance in prior decisions interpreting wills . . . due to the different intent and circumstances of each testator . . . .â€Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home, 365 S.C. at 166, 616 S.E.2d at 715 (citation omitted).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the language of the Will and Trust clearly indicates Testatorâ€™s intent that the Trust assets pass only to devisees surviving at the time the Trust terminates.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â  \r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4181","title":"Wright v.

Craft, d/b/a/ Craft Auto Mart, Inc., for revocation of acceptance, breach of contract, negligence, constructive fraud, fraud, violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to -560 (UTPA), violation of the Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act, Â§Â§ 56-15-10 to -600 (Dealers Act), and violation of the Federal Odometer Statute.Â  The trial court granted Craft summary judgment on Wrightâ€™s causes of action for fraud and violation of the Federal Odometer Statute.Â  Wright withdrew his causes of action for revocation of acceptance, breach of contract and constructive fraud. The jury rendered verdicts as follows:\r\n\r\n(1)Â  Negligenceâ€”The jury awarded Wright actual damages of $25,578 and punitive damages of $12,789. \r\n(2)Â  UTPAâ€”The jury awarded Wright actual damages of $25,578.\r\n(3) Dealers Actâ€”The jury awarded Wright actual damages of $51,156 and punitive damages of $12,789. \r\n\r\nOn Wrightâ€™s motion to treble damages under the UTPA, the trial court required Wright to elect his remedy.Â  Wright chose to proceed under the UTPA.Â  The trial court trebled the UTPA damages and awarded Wright attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $70,650 and costs in the amount of $4656.59.Â  Craft filed a motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto (JNOV) and a motion to strike damages, which were denied by the trial court. Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWright purchased a used 2001 Ford F-150 (Truck) from Craft Auto Mart, Inc. (Craft Auto) in July of 2002.Â  When purchased by its first owner the Truck came with a 36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, which was transferable to subsequent owners.Â  In November of 2001, the Truck was involved in an accident in which it rolled and flipped over.Â  The incident damaged the right quarter panel and the hood of the Truck, broke windows, and caused both air bags to deploy.Â  State Farm Insurance Company bought the Truck from the first owner.\r\nCraft purchased the Truck at a vehicle auction to repair and sell at Craft Auto.Â  The purchase was arranged by an acquaintance, Jim Spoon, whom Craft instructed to buy the Truck if â€œjust the sheet metal was damaged.â€[1]\r\nCraft had the Truck repaired at Bestway Body Shop.Â  Replacements for some of the damaged parts were obtained from the Ford Dealership and others came from Keystone Automotive Industries.Â  Lindsay Brothers supplied a used airbag.[2]Â  Craft saw the Truck about a week after the repair work had begun.Â  He observed some of the wrecked parts and noted that the original airbags had deployed during the wreck. Craft claimed his observations supported his belief that the Truck only had sheet metal damage. \r\nCraft advertised the Truck for sale as a â€œone-owner vehicleâ€ and did not reveal that the Truck had been wrecked and repaired.Â  Wright saw the advertisement, contacted Craft Auto, and questioned Zack Rickard, an employee, about the Truckâ€™s mileage, warranty, and condition. Â Rickard informed Wright the Truck had ten thousand miles, came with a warranty, and had nothing wrong with it.Â  Wright specifically asked Rickard if the Truck had any damage and Rickard responded that it did not.Â Â Â  \r\nWright, accompanied by Rickard, test drove the Truck and noticed the check engine and seat belt lights came on.Â  Rickard assured Wright â€œthere would be no problemâ€ because it was covered and would be checked.Â  In addition, Wright observed some exterior damage near the driverâ€™s side door of the Truck and was advised â€œit was done in the parking lot like somebody opened the door and hit it, or it got hit with a grocery cart.â€Â  Wright said he would buy the Truck if â€œeverything that I see wrong with it when Iâ€™m looking at it, heâ€™d have it fixed before I bought it.â€Â  \r\nIn attending to the warning lights, Craft took the Truck to Bob Bennett Ford, where he learned that any Truck parts damaged in the wreck or painted because of the wreck would not be covered by the warranty.Â  Moreover, Craft was warned the warranty did not cover parts and components not replaced by genuine Ford parts.Â  Components not covered by warranty included the used airbags from Lindsay and the generic parts from Keystone.\r\nCraft never told Wright the Truck had been wrecked, purchased from State Farm at auction, and repaired.Â  He maintained he did not know what was covered by the factory warranty, nor did he inform Wright about parts he specifically knew were not under factory warranty. \r\nThe Buyerâ€™s Guide Wright received at the time of purchase stated the Truck was sold â€œas is-no warranty.â€Â  Wright inquired about the extent of the warranty and Craft wrote on the back of the Buyerâ€™s Guide â€œfactory warranty, if applicable.â€Â  When Wright asked why the factory warranty was qualified with â€œif applicable,â€ Craft claimed he did not know how much time was remaining on the factory warranty.Â  Craft made an additional notation on the back of the Buyerâ€™s Guide indicating the Truck had â€œprevious paintwork.â€ \r\nWhile driving the Truck in September of 2002, Wright observed an illuminated check engine light, which was repaired under warranty at a Ford dealership.Â  A month or so later, Wright experienced the Truck shaking and shutting off.Â  He returned the Truck to the Ford dealership in October of 2002.Â  David McCauley, a mechanic from the Ford dealership who owned the same model F-150, lifted the hood on his own truck to show Wright what the interior under the hood should look like.Â  McCauley explained that if wreck damage was causing the Truckâ€™s trouble, the repair would not be covered under warranty. After learning the Truck had been wrecked, Wright called to complain to Craft, who told Wright there was nothing he could do.Â  Wright grew concerned that the Truck was not safe to drive.Â  \r\nAt trial, Ford Motors field service engineer, Stuart Sonnen, testified that repairs are not covered under a factory warranty if the parts used in the repairs are not manufactured by Ford or if the parts are not installed by an authorized Ford agent.Â  Ray Morris, a former car salesman, averred that the Truck had serious safety concerns.Â  Moreover, he claimed that in the retail market, the Truck was valueless in its current condition.Â  John Disher, a Ford-certified body shop owner who qualified as an expert in the field of automotive repair, maintained the welds formed to repair the Truck were not satisfactory and did not meet factory specifications.Â  Disher expressed concern about what might happen to the Truck in another accident.Â  â€œThe structural integrity [of the Truck] ha[d] not been restored and it would probably collapse.â€ Â Â \r\nWright claimed his losses as a result of purchasing the Truck from Craft included: (1) $33.18 to have the hood fixed; (2) sixteen Truck payments totaling $6395.04; (3) twelve Truck payments after refinancing totaling $3739.80; (4) $12,766.21 remaining on his Truck loan obligation; and (5) negative equity on the vehicle he traded in for the Truck in the amount of $2643.92. Â Wrightâ€™s total damages amounted to $25,578.15. \r\nIn Craftâ€™s statement of issues on appeal he contends the trial court erred in failing to: (1) grant the motion for directed verdict; (2) grant the motion for JNOV; (3) strike damages from the UTPA cause of action; (4) allow the entry of the Truck into evidence; (5) admit Wrightâ€™s loan application into evidence; and (6) grant the motion for summary judgment. Additionally, Craft appeals the juryâ€™s verdict on the ground it was the result of undue passion and prejudice. Â Apart from his statement of issues on appeal, in his brief Craft asserts that Wright should have been estopped from alleging he suffered damages under the UTPA. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, the court is presented with a divided scope of review, and each action retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of review on appeal.Â  Blackmon v. Weaver, 366 S.C. 245, 248-49, 621 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2005); Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 338 S.C. 572, 580, 527 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations omitted).Â  The proper analysis is to view the actions separately for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review.Â  Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005).\r\nActions at Law\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of the appellate court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding by the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.Â  Erickson v. Jones Street Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 464, 629 S.E.2d 663-64 (2006); R &amp; G. Const. Inc., v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 431, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000) cert. dismissed (July 22, 2002) rehearing denied (Aug 21, 2002). Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\nWhen reviewing a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, an appellate court must employ the same standard as the trial court.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006); Proctor v. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 292, 628 S.E.2d 496, 503 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004)); The Huffines Co., L.L.C. v. Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 187, 617 S.E.2d 125, 129 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  On appeal from an order denying a directed verdict, an appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999); Mullinax v. Brown Amusement, 326 S.C. 453, 456, 485 S.E.2d 103, 105 (Ct. App. 1997) affâ€™d 333 S.C. 89, 508 S.E.2d 848 (1998).Â  â€œThe appellate court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€ Jones v. General Electric Co., 331 S.C. 351, 356, 503 S.E.2d 173, 176 (Ct. App. 1998).Â Â Â  \r\nThis court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict motion only if no evidence exists to support the ruling, or if the decision was controlled by an error of law.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, ___, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006); McMillan, 367 S.C. at 564, 626 S.E.2d at 886; Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005); Swinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 477, 514 S.E.2d at 130; Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Erickson, 368 S.C. at 463, 629 S.E.2d at 663.\r\nActions at Equity\r\nIn an action at equity, a reviewing court can find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Key Corporate Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 360 S.C. 513, 516, 602 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Estoppel is an equitable concept.Â  Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215, 592 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2004); West v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., 357 S.C. 537, 541, 593 S.E.2d 500, 542 (Ct. App. 2004); Quinn v. Sharon Corp., 343 S.C. 411, 416, 540 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 2000) (Anderson, J., concurring in result only).Â  However, a distinction should be made between cases in which the defendantâ€™s answer asserts merely an equitable defense, and cases in which the answer seeks affirmative equitable relief. Rogers v. Nation, 284 S.C. 330, 332-33, 326 S.C.2d 182, 183 (Ct. App 1985).Â  In the case of an equitable defense, the nature of the action remains the same. Id.; but seeÂ  Brown v. Chandler, 50 S.C. 385, 27 S.E. 868 (1897) (holding an equitable defense in a legal action receives equity review).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially, we address several procedural matters, noting that a number of Craftâ€™s issues on appeal are not preserved for our review.Â  When a defendant moves for a directed verdict under Rule 50, SCRCP at the close of the plaintiffâ€™s case, he must renew that motion at the close of all evidence. Hendrix v. E. Distribution, Inc., 316 S.C. 34, 37 446 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct. App. 1994) affâ€™d in result, 320 S.C. 218, 464 S.E.2d 112 (1995).Â  See State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, 43, 626 S.E.2d 898, 900 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œIf a defendant presents evidence after the denial of his motion for a directed verdict at the close of the [plaintiffâ€™s] case, he must make another motion for a directed verdict at the close of all evidence in order to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence.â€); State v. Rosemond, 348 S.C. 621, 560 S.E.2d 636 (Ct. App. 2002), affâ€™d as modified 356 S.C. 426, 589 S.E.2d 757 (2003). Otherwise, this court is precluded from reviewing the denial of the motion on appeal. Hendrix, 316 S.C. at 37, 446 S.E.2d at 442. Craft moved for a directed verdict at the close of Wrightâ€™s case, but failed to renew the motion after concluding his presentation of evidence.Â  Consequently, the denial of Craftâ€™s motion is not preserved for our review.\r\nConcomitantly, a motion for JNOV under Rule 50(b), SCRCP is a renewal of a directed verdict motion.Â  Glover v. N.C. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 295 S.C. 251, 256, 368 S.E.2d 68, 72 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  When a party fails to renew a motion for a directed verdict at the close of all evidence, he waives his right to move for\r\nJNOV.&nbsp; Henderson v. St. Francis Cmty. Hosp., 295 S.C. 441, 446, 369 S.E.2d 652, 656 (Ct. App. 1988). Â Because Craft did not renew his motion for a directed verdict at the close of all evidence, there is no JNOV motion to review.Â  In addition, Craft identified the denial of the JNOV motion in his statement of issues on appeal but failed to address it in his brief.Â  â€œAn issue raised on appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by the appellate court.â€Â \r\nFields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 284 (Ct. App. 1993); Bell v. Bennett, 307 S.C. 286, 294, 414 S.E.2d 786, 791 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nThe record indicates Craft did not comply with the time requirements under Rule 59, SCRCP in filing his motion to strike damages. Â Moreover, the denial of the motion to strike damages is listed in his statement of issues on appeal, but Craft did not address the denial in his brief.Â  The issue is, therefore, deemed abandoned.Â  Id.Â  Likewise, Craftâ€™s argument that the juryâ€™s verdict was the result of undue passion and prejudice was included in his statement of issues on appeal.Â  Craft failed to pursue the issue in his brief and it is not properly before this court.Â  Id.  \r\nIn his brief Craft advanced an argument grounded on a general estoppel theory.Â  However, Craft failed to plead estoppel as a defense in his answer to Wrightâ€™s complaint. â€œEvery defense, in law or fact, to a cause of action in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto . . . .â€Â  Rule 12, SCRCP.Â  â€œ[E]stoppel must be affirmatively [pleaded] as a defense and cannot be bootstrapped onto another claim.â€Â  Collins Entmâ€™t, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 562, 611 S.E.2d 262, 270 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Rule 8, SCRCP); Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 478, 451 S.E.2d 924, 929 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  The failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver of the right to assert it.Â  See, e. g., Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, 419, 377 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1989) (ruling that an affirmative defense not pleaded in the answer or raised before the trial court will not be addressed on appeal).Â  Additionally, Craft failed to raise the estoppel issue to the trial court for a ruling.Â  Accordingly, that issue is not preserved for this courtâ€™s review.Â \r\nUlmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, ___, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006) (citing \r\nIn re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€)); Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, ___, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2006); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004); Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779 (2004).Â  Â Furthermore, Craft did not set forth the estoppel argument in his statement of issues on appeal. Â Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR requires an appellantâ€™s initial brief to contain â€œ[a] statement of each of the issues presented for review.â€Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (â€œNo point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal.â€) (citing State v. Bray, 342 S.C. 23, 28, 535 S.E.2d 636, 639, n. 2 (2000)); State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 411, 548 S.E.2d 213, 216 (2001); Barnes v. Cohen Dry Wall, Inc., 357 S.C. 280, 287, 592 S.E.2d 311, 314, n. 11 (Ct. App. 2003) (declining to address issues that were not set forth in appellantâ€™s statement of issues on appeal).Â  Luculently, the issue of estoppel is not properly before this court. \r\nI.Â  UTPA\r\nCraft challenges the trial courtâ€™s ruling in denying his motion for a directed verdict on Wrightâ€™s UTPA cause of action.Â  He contends he was entitled to a directed verdict on the following grounds: \r\n\r\n(A) Damagesâ€”The damages awarded by the jury were improper under the UTPA; Wright suffered no damages; \r\n(B) Deceptive Actâ€”Wright failed to demonstrate Craftâ€™s conduct was deceptive because Craft did not have a duty to disclose; and \r\n(C) Craftâ€™s act or practices did not impact the public interest.Â  \r\n\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence and all its reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Long v. Norris &amp; Assocs. Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 568, 538 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2000). Â When the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.Â  Id.Â  On the other hand, the trial court must deny a motion for a directed verdict when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt. McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006); Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001); Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).Â  If more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied and the case must be submitted to the jury.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003); Long, 342 S.C. at 568, 538 S.E.2d at 9; Adams v. G.J. Creel Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).Â  However, this rule does not authorize the submission of speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the jury.Â  Proctor v. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 292-93, 628 S.E.2d 496, 503 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The issue must be submitted to the jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror. Â The Huffines Co., LLC v. Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 188, 617 S.E.2d 125, 130 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence. Â Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002); Long, 342 S.C. at 568, 538 S.E.2d at 9.\r\nThe evidence in this case must be evaluated in light of the legislative mandate set forth in sections 39-5-10 to -560 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005). Â The UTPA declares â€œunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . . unlawful.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1976). Â The terms â€œtradeâ€ and â€œcommerceâ€ â€œinclude the advertising, offering for sale, sale or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity or thing of value wherever situate, and include any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this State.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-10(b) (1976).Â  â€œAn unfair trade practice has been defined as a practice which is offensive to public policy or which is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.â€Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 606, 623 S.E.2d 107, 120 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 269, 536 S.E.2d 399, 407 (Ct. App. 2000)). Â To recover in an action under the UTPA, the plaintiff must show:Â  (1) the defendant engaged in an unfair or deceptive act in the conduct of trade or commerce; (2) the unfair or deceptive act affected public interest; and (3) the plaintiff suffered monetary or property loss as a result of the defendantâ€™s unfair or deceptive act(s).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to -560. \r\nA.Â  Damages\r\nCraftâ€™s contentions that the damages the jury awarded Wright were not proper under the UTPA and that Wright did not sustain any damages fail on the merits.\r\nâ€œAn action for damages may be brought under [UTPA] for â€˜unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce.â€Â  Camp v. Springs Mortg. Corp., 310 S.C. 514, 517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1993).Â  Section 39-5-140(a) creates a private right of action in favor of â€œ[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 . . . .â€ Â Under section 39-5-140, a plaintiff can recover treble damages where â€œthe use or employment of the unfair or deceptive . . . act or practice was\r\na willful or knowing violation of Â§ 39-5-20.â€Â  Noack Enters., Inc. v. Country Corner Interiors of Hilton Head Island, Inc., 290 S.C. 475, 477, 351 S.E.2d 347, 348-49 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\nCraft relies on Barton v. Superior Motors, Inc. in support of his position that Wrightâ€™s damages were not proper under the UTPA.Â  309 S.C. 491, 494, 424 S.E.2d 524, 526 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œThe measure of damages for the sale of a defective vehicle is the difference in fair market value between the car, having been wrecked, and the value of the car had it not been wrecked at time of sale.â€) (citations omitted).Â  In Barton, the plaintiff sought to recover damages under the Dealers Act, section 56-15-40(1) of the South Carolina Code (Rev. 1991).Â  Barton, 309 S.C. at 494, 424 S.E.2d at 526.Â  In the case sub judice, although the jury found for Wright under the Dealers Act and the UTPA, the trial court required Wright to elect his remedy and he elected the UTPA.Â  That ruling has not been appealed and Wright can only recover on the UTPA claim.Â  Accordingly, Barton is not applicable and we address whether damages were proper under the UTPA.\r\nThe UTPA allows for the recovery of actual damages.Â  See Global Prot. Corp. v. Halbersberg, 332 S.C. 149, 159, 503 S.E.2d 483, 488 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (1976)). â€œActual damages under the UTPA include special or consequential damages that are a natural and proximate result of deceptive conduct.â€Â  Id. (citing Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996)).Â  The jury awarded actual damages that equaled the actual damages Wright claimed.Â  Wright provided evidence the Truck was valueless in its wrecked and repaired condition.Â  Additionally, he had paid nearly one half of the outstanding balance on his car loan, and he lost the equity on the vehicle he traded in for the Truck.Â  The damages Wright sustained arose out of Craftâ€™s selling the Truck without disclosing it had been wrecked and repaired.Â  Material evidence existed that could reasonably establish a finding of damages in the minds of the jurors.Â  \r\nB.Â  Deceptive Act\r\nCraft maintains Wright failed to demonstrate an unfair or deceptive act because Craft did not have a duty to disclose the Truck had been wrecked.Â  We disagree.\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Duty to Disclose \r\nWhether Craft had a duty to inform Wright that the truck had been wrecked and repaired was a question of law for the trial court to address.Â  â€œThe Court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.â€Â  Charleston Dry Cleaners &amp; Laundry, Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 355 S.C. 614, 618, 586 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2003); Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999); Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 46, 619 S.E.2d 437, 451 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\n\r\nThe duty to disclose may be reduced to three distinct classes: (1) where it arises from a preexisting definite fiduciary relation between the parties; (2) where one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the other with reference to the particular transaction in question, or else from the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position towards each other, such a trust and confidence in the particular case is necessarily implied; (3) where the very contract or transaction itself, in its essential nature, is intrinsically fiduciary and necessarily calls for perfect good faith and full disclosure without regard to any particular intention of the parties.\r\n\r\nEllie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 101, 594 S.E.2d 485, 497 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2004) (citing Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 673-74, 582 S.E.2d 432, 445-46 (Ct. App. 2003)).Â  \r\nUnderstanding that nothing in the UTPA suggests a deceptive act must be predicated on a violation of the duty to disclose, as Craft seems to suggest, we review the evidence to discern whether a duty to disclose was implicated in the transaction between Craft and Wright.Â  On examination by Wrightâ€™s attorney Craft admitted: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Now, do you intend for your customers to rely on what you tell them about the vehicle they are purchasing?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Do you expect customers to rely on the statements you make about a vehicle?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yeah. The year and make of the car is very vital.Â  I have to give them the correct year so they know how to make their own investigation of the car.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       You expect your customers to fully believe what you tell them about the vehicles you sell them, is that right?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       And it is reasonable for customers to rely on what you tell them, isnâ€™t it?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCraft acknowledged in his testimony that he intended for his customers to repose trust and confidence in his representations concerning the vehicles he sold them.Â  Furthermore, before purchasing the Truck Wright repeatedly questioned Craft and his employees about the Truckâ€™s condition, the warranty, and the Truckâ€™s observable defects, indicating he relied on the trustworthiness of Craftâ€™s representations concerning the Truck.Â  With reference to the particular transaction in question, we conclude from the circumstances of the case and the nature of their dealings a duty to disclose existed because of the trust and confidence Wright reposed in Craftâ€™s representations. Â See Ellie, Inc., 358 S.C. at 101, 594 S.E.2d at 497.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Tendency to Deceive\r\nOur case law instructs that a deceptive act is any act which has a tendency to deceive.Â  deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 269, 536 S.E.2d 399, 407 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œEven a truthful statement may be deceptive if it has a capacity or tendency to deceive.â€Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 606, 623 S.E.2d 107, 120 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted).Â  Whether an act or practice is unfair or deceptive within the meaning of the UTPA depends on the surrounding facts and the impact of the transaction on the marketplace.Â  deBondt, 342 S.C. 269, 536 S.E.2d at 407.Â  â€œAn act is â€˜unfairâ€™ when it is offensive to public policy or when it is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.â€Â \r\nBessinger v. BI-LO, Inc., 366 S.C. 426, 432, 622 S.E.2d 564, 567 (Ct. App. 2005) (cert. pending) (citing Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 12, 522 S.E.2d 137, 143 (1999)). \r\nSouth Carolina precedent establishes that failure to accurately represent the history of a car constitutes a deceptive trade practice under section 39-5-20.Â  Our Supreme Court ruled the purchaser of a car had a cause of action under the UTPA because the dealer represented that the car was a â€œnew demonstratorâ€ and had â€œall the bugs worked out,â€ when it had, in fact, been sold and returned by the previous owner.Â  Inman v. Ken Hyatt Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 294 S.C. 240, 242, 363 S.E.2d 691, 692 (1988).Â  Accordingly, in Dowd v. Imperial Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., this court held a salesmanâ€™s representation that a car had been leased as part of a fleet, when the car, in fact, had been maintained by the dealer for daily rentals, constituted a â€œdeceptive trade practiceâ€ under the UTPA. Â 298 S.C. 439, 442-43, 381 S.E.2d 212, 214 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Applying this reasoning to facts similar to those in the instant case, the Supreme Court upheld a UTPA claim for failure to disclose that a vehicle had been previously wrecked.Â  In Ward v. Dick Dyer and Assocs., Inc., plaintiffs initiated an action against a dealer whose employee failed to inform them the vehicle they purchased had been wrecked and repaired. 304 S.C. 152, 158, 403 S.E.2d 310, 313 (1991).Â Â  Subsequently, the dealer offered to replace or purchase the vehicle, and the dealer raised that offer as a defense against the plaintiffsâ€™ cause of action. Id.Â  The Supreme Court declared the offer to replace or purchase an automobile was no defense to a claim under the UTPA that the dealer failed to disclose the vehicle had been involved previously in an accident. Id.  \r\nAt trial in this case, Craft responded to questions from Wrightâ€™s attorney concerning the information he provided to his customers. The following colloquy illustrates that Craftâ€™s business practices involve statements that have the capacity or tendency to deceive:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Now, you know that when youâ€™re dealing withâ€”you know you have to be fair with your customers?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Thatâ€™s right.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And you have to be honest with your customers?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And you have to thoroughâ€”you have to explain things thoroughly to your customers?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       I will explain what is asked.Â  If the customer asks a question, I will explain something about the car or the equipment on it.Â \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Did you provide the information that was on the title that came from State Farm to Mr. Wright?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       I conveyed information that I received off of the car and the title such as serial number, make, model, year, a description of the vehicle.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Did you tell him that State Farm had owned this vehicle?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       He didnâ€™t ask.Â  You know, that was not asked.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       So the answer is no?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       I would have if he had asked.Â  I would have showed him the title if he had asked.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       So the answer is no, you didnâ€™t tell him?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       No, I did not.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Do you understand that if you tell somebody a vehicle was wrecked, they know it was wrecked? You made that clear to them?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Do you understand that by not telling them it was wrecked that you are representing to them that it hasnâ€™t been wrecked?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      (Objection by Craftâ€™s attorney on record)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Do you understand that by not telling somebody that a vehicle had been wrecked, you are letting them believe that it had not been wrecked?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Do you understand that?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCraft had a duty to disclose that the Truck had been previously wrecked, damaged, and extensively repaired. The failure to disclose supported the juryâ€™s finding that Craftâ€™s conduct was unfair or deceptive.Â  Moreover, the information Craft did share with Wright was misleading.Â  Instead of informing Wright about the extent of the Truckâ€™s damage and repairs, Craft claimed the damage Wright had observed was the result of a shopping cart or car door hitting the Truck in a parking lot.Â  Furthermore, Craft withheld information he had about the extent of the factory warranty on the Truck.Â  Craft averred he told Wright the Truck would be under whatever factory warranty was applicable. Â In actuality, Craft knew some of the parts that had been replaced, including the re-painted parts of the Truck, were not covered by factory warranty.Â  Wright claimed Craft told him the Truck would be covered by the full factory warranty.Â  Finally, when Wright asked why the previous owner no longer wanted the Truck, Craft responded that the former owner â€œjust wanted a different truck.â€Â  Craft never showed Wright the title to the Truck, from which Wright could have learned that State Farm Insurance Company formerly owned the vehicle.Â  The evidentiary record reveals ample support for the juryâ€™s conclusion that Craftâ€™s conduct, having the tendency and capacity to deceive, was unfair and deceptive under the UTPA. \r\nC.Â  Public Interest\r\nCraftâ€™s assertion that his conduct in this matter does not impact public interest and, therefore, does not support a claim under the UTPA is without merit. \r\nTo be actionable under the UTPA, an unfair or deceptive act or practice must have an impact upon the public interest.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-1-10(b) (Trade as used in this article â€œshall include any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this State.â€) (emphasis added); see Haley Nursery Co. v. Forrest, 298 S.C. 520, 524, 381 S.E.2d 906, 908 (1989).Â  â€œSince 1986, South Carolina courts have required that a plaintiff bringing a private cause of action under UTPA allege and prove the defendantâ€™s actions adversely affected the public interest.â€ Â Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996).Â  â€œAn impact on the public interest may be shown if the acts or practices have the potential for repetition.â€Â  Singleton v. Stokes Motors, Inc., 358 S.C. 369, 379, 595 S.E.2d 461, 466 (2004) (citing Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 387, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998)); Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 606, 623 S.E.2d 107, 120 (Ct. App. 2005); Noack Enters., Inc. v. Country Corner Interiors of Hilton Head Island, Inc., 290 S.C. 475, 480, 351 S.E.2d 347, 350-51 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nThe potential for repetition may be demonstrated in either of two ways: (1) by showing the same kind of actions occurred in the past, thus making it likely they will continue to occur absent deterrence; or (2) by showing the companyâ€™s procedures create a potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.Â  Singleton, 358 S.C. at 379, 595 S.E.2d at 466; Daisy, 322 S.C. at 496, 473 S.E.2d at 51 (citing Haley, 298 S.C. at 524, 381 S.E.2d at 908; Dowd v. Imperial Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 298 S.C. 439, 442, 381 S.E.2d 212, 214 (Ct. App. 1989); Barnes v. Jones Chevrolet Co., 292 S.C. 607, 613, 358 S.E.2d 156, 159-60 (Ct. App. 1987)). Â These two ways are not the only means for showing the potential for repetition or public impact, and each case must be evaluated on its own merits to determine what a plaintiff must show to satisfy the potential for repetition/public impact prong of the UTPA. Daisy, 322 S.C. at 497, 473 S.E.2d at 51.Â  Nevertheless, a plaintiff proves an adverse effect on public interests if he proves facts that demonstrate the potential for repetition. Â Id. at 493, 473 S.E.2d at 49; see also Crary, 329 S.C. at 388, 496 S.E.2d at 23 (â€œThe plaintiff need not allege or prove anything further in relation to the public interest requirement.â€).\r\nCraftâ€™s testimony on direct examination by Wrightâ€™s attorney reveals the potential for repetition of the same deceptive act Wright encountered in his dealings with Craft: Â Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Now, Mr. Spoon was your employee, wasnâ€™t he?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       No.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       But you knew him through the car business?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       For eight or nine years?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       I would say I have known him pretty close to that.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       And in the past, Mr. Spoon has told you that he has found vehicles that were damaged but that you might want to buy and have repaired so you can sell them on your lot?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       That wasnâ€™t a frequent thing.Â  I didnâ€™t buy a lot of vehicles like that.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n      But that has happened in the past, hasnâ€™t it?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       He has called me, yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And he has told you about previously wrecked cars that he could fix and you could sell on your lot?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And Mr. Spoon would buy these vehicles and fix them and then you would sell them?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Right.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And when you sold them, you knew he had previously fixed these vehicles after they had been previously wrecked?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       You didnâ€™t tell your customers, did you, when these cars were bought by them?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       I usually if it was brought up would tell themâ€”I usually would tell them if the car had previous paint work or body work.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       But if they didnâ€™t bring it up, you didnâ€™t mention it. Right?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Well, for one thing, I donâ€™t buy cars . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (Objection on record from Craftâ€™s attorney)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       If other customers would buy a previously owned vehicle and didnâ€™t ask if the vehicle had been wrecked, you didnâ€™t disclose that, did you?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       A lot of times I did.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       But there were other times you didnâ€™t?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      I donâ€™t know which time youâ€™re asking me about. Normally I would tell them if it had previous paint work and I knew about it.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCraft confirmed he often buys cars with damage from insurance auctions and repairs them to sell on his car lot.Â  He generally knows when those vehicles have been wrecked or damaged but does not always disclose that fact to his customers.Â  Craft denied that he did anything wrong in his sale to Wright and admitted that he has not changed the way he does business as a result of this litigation.Â  The record is replete with evidence indicating Craft has previously engaged in and would continue to engage in the same business practices and procedures that affected his transactions with Wright.Â  \r\nAccordingly, evidence existed that would lead reasonable jurors to conclude: (1) Wright sustained the damages he alleged, and those damages were proper under the UTPA; (2) Craft engaged in a deceptive and unfair trade practice; and (3) Craftâ€™s deceptive and unfair practice affected the public interest.Â Â  Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying Craftâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on Wrightâ€™s UTPA cause of action.\r\nII.Â  Denial of JNOV\r\nCraft complains the trial court erred in denying his motion for a JNOV.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen ruling on a JNOV motion, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â \r\nSabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  This court must follow the same standard.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000). Â This court will only reverse the trial court when no evidence supports its ruling.Â  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999) (citing Creech v. S.C. Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997)); S.C. Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, 885 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe appellate court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.â€).\r\nFor the same reasons we affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of Craftâ€™s motion for directed verdict, we conclude evidence existed to support the courtâ€™s ruling on the JNOV motion.\r\nIII.Â  Denial of Motion to Strike Damages\r\nCraft contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike damages from the UTPA cause of action.Â  We disagree.\r\nA motion to strike is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion, and an appellate court will not reverse absent an abuse of that discretion. Mayes v. Paxton, 313 S.C. 109, 115, 437, S.E.2d 66, 70 (1993).Â  Craftâ€™s argument basically reiterated the same grounds asserted in his motion for a directed verdict. Apodictically, Craftâ€™s motion to strike damages was essentially a motion for a directed verdict.Â  SeeÂ  Allison v. Charter Rivers Hosp., Inc.,Â  334 S.C. 611, 615, 514 S.E.2d 601, 604 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This court may only reverse the denial of a motion for directed verdict when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Id. at 616, 514 S.E.2d at 604.\r\nCraft moved to strike damages maintaining that the $33.18 hood repair constituted the only damages Wright sustained, and those damages were de minimis.Â  The trial court issued a form order denying Craftâ€™s motion to strike.Â  Wright presented evidence of damages totaling $25,578.15.Â  Evidence existed to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling on Craftâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Admission of Evidence\r\nCraft argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit the Truck and Wrightâ€™s loan application into evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error prejudicing the defendant.Â \r\nState v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 228, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  The trial court has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence, and its decision to admit or reject evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 257-58, 599 S.E.2d 467, 476 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 365, 429 S.E.2d 190, 192 (1993); Davis v. Traylor, 340 S.C. 150, 155, 530 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 2000); Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 108, 498 S.E.2d 395, 404 (Ct. App. 1998)).Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE; see Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 497 n.12, 534 S.E.2d 295, 301 n.12 (Ct. App. 2000); Hunter v. Staples, 335 S.C. 93, 101-02, 515 S.E.2d 261, 266 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Menne v. Keowee Key Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, Inc., 368 S.C. 557, 568, 629 S.E.2d 690, 696 (Ct. App. 2006) (cert. pending).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005); see Am. Fed. Bank, FSB v. No. One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 174, 467 S.E.2d 439, 442 (1996); Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commâ€™n., 254 S.C. 378, 405, 175 S.E.2d 805, 819 (1970); Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 162, 156 S.E.2d 759, 765 (1967).\r\nThe trial court admitted a number of photographs of the Truck into evidence, and the jurors were allowed to review the photographs as they deliberated.Â  In addition, the jurors heard testimony regarding the condition of the Truck, both after the accident and at the time of trial.Â  Admitting the actual Truck itself into evidence would have been cumulative, causing needless waste of time.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying admission of the Truck. \r\nCraftâ€™s attorney attempted to enter Wrightâ€™s loan application into evidence to establish that Wright represented the Truckâ€™s value between $15,000 and $16,000.Â  The trial court ruled that the information Craft sought could be elicited by testimony without entering the loan document, thereby avoiding a potential hearsay problem.Â  We discern no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling. Â \r\nV. Â Denial of Summary Judgment\r\nCraft maintains the trial court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe denial of summary judgment does not finally determine anything about the merits of the case . . . .Â  Therefore, an order denying a motion for summary judgment\r\nis not appealable.â€Â  Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 477-78, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994); see also Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 580 S.E.2d 440 (2003) (â€œWe adhere to recent precedent and hold that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable, even after final judgment.â€); Silverman v.

Gordon Auto Sales, 283 S.C. 53, 56, 320 S.E.2d 501, 503 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Accordingly, we refrain from addressing the denial of Craftâ€™s summary judgment motion.\r\nVI.Â  Verdict Result of Undue Passion and Prejudice by the Jury\r\nCraft alleges the juryâ€™s verdict was the result of undue passion and prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial court may grant a new trial absolute on the ground that the verdict is excessive or inadequate. Â Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 446, 520 S.E.2d 625, 628-629 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The juryâ€™s determination of damages, however, is entitled to substantial deference.Â  Id.; Brabham v. S. Asphalt Haulers, Inc., 223 S.C. 421, 430, 76 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1953).Â  Compelling reasons must be given to justify invading the juryâ€™s province by granting a new trial to adjust damages.Â  SeeÂ  Proctor v. Depâ€™t of Health and Envntl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 320, 628 S.E.2d 496, 518 (Ct. App. 2006) â€œWhen considering a motion for a new trial based on the inadequacy or excessiveness of the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court must distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice, or prejudice.â€Â  Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 26, 602 S.E.2d 772, 781 (2004); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 530, 431 S.E.2d 557, 558 (1993) (footnote omitted). Â â€œA new trial absolute should be granted only if the verdict is so grossly excessive that it shocks the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the amount of the verdict was the â€˜result of caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or other improper motives.â€™ â€ Smalls v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Educ., 339 S.C. 208, 215, 528 S.E.2d 682, 686 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations omitted); Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 404, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 9, 466 S.E.2d 727, 731 (1996)). Â To warrant a new trial, the verdict must be so grossly excessive as to clearly indicate the influence of an improper motive on the jury. Â Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302, 536 S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial absolute in this situation amounts to an abuse of discretion, and on appeal this court will grant a new trial absolute. Stevens, 336 S.C. at 447, 520 S.E.2d at 629 (citing Vinson, 324 S.C. at 404-05, 477 S.E.2d at 723); Allstate Ins. Co., 314 S.C. at 531, 431 S.E.2d at 558.Â  However, â€œ[w]hen a verdict falls within the range of the evidence, the courts will not disturb it on the ground of excessiveness.â€Â  Satcher v. Berry, 299 S.C. 381, 385, 385 S.E.2d 41, 43 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œThe juryâ€™s verdict will not be overturned if any evidence exists that sustains the factual findings implicit in its decision.â€ Smalls, 339 S.C. at 215, 528 S.E.2d at 686.\r\nThe trial court, which heard the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial, possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this court. Â Krepps v. Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 608, 479 S.E.2d 290, 295-96 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Accordingly, the decision to grant a new trial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and generally will not be disturbed on appeal. Â Id.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law. Â Id.Â  â€œIn deciding whether to assess error when a new trial motion is\r\ndenied, this [c]ourt must consider the testimony and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€ Â Welch, 342 S.C. at 302-03, 536 S.E.2d at 420.\r\nThe jury awarded damages equal to the actual damages Wright claimed.Â  The verdict is within the range of evidence presented and that evidence sustains the factual findings implicit in the juryâ€™s decision.Â  Accordingly, we give the proper deference to the jury in awarding damages and to the trial court in reviewing that award.Â  \r\nVII.Â  Estoppel\r\nCraft claims Wright should be estopped from alleging damages because Wright stated in a loan application that the Truckâ€™s value was $15,000 to $16,000, while complaining in this action that the Truck has no value.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe â€œ[e]ssential elements of estoppel as related to the party claiming the estoppel are: (1) lack of knowledge and of means of knowledge of truth as to facts in question; (2) reliance upon conduct of the party estopped; and (3) prejudicial change in position.â€Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 589, 553 S.E.2d 110, 114 (2001).Â  The â€œ[e]lements of equitable estoppel as to the party estopped are: (1) conduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) the intention that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the true facts.â€Â  Id.Â  Evidence indicates Craft had at least as much, if not more knowledge about the true value of the Truck than Wright did.Â  In addition, no evidence suggests the loan application executed by Wright was intended to induce Craftâ€™s reliance on the information contained in the application.Â  Moreover, Craft did not change his position in reliance on the loan application. Â \r\nUnder the theory of judicial estoppel Craft claims Wright maintained two inconsistent positionsâ€”i. e. in the loan application Wright stated the Truck was worth $15,000 to $16,000 and in the current action he alleges that the Truck is worthless.Â  â€œJudicial estoppel is an equitable concept that prevents a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with, or in conflict with, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or related proceeding.â€  Cothran v. Brown,\r\n357 S.C. 210, 215, 592 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2004) (emphasis added).Â  The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure the integrity of the judicial process, not to protect the parties from allegedly dishonest conduct by their adversary. Â Id. (citing Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, 353 S.C. 31, 42, 577 S.E.2d 202, 208 (2003)).Â  Five elements are required for the application of judicial estoppel:\r\n\r\n(1) two inconsistent positions must be taken by the same party or parties in privity with each other;\r\n(2) the two inconsistent positions were both made pursuant to sworn statements;\r\n(3) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same parties in privity with each other;\r\n(4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and\r\n(5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent-that is, the truth of one position must necessarily preclude the veracity of the other position.\r\n\r\nQuinn v. Sharon Corp., 343 S.C. 411, 422, 540 S.E.2d 474, 480 (Ct. App. 2000) (Anderson, J., concurring in result only) (emphasis added).\r\nCraft urges us to take a broad view of the phrase â€œsame or relatedâ€ but does not explain how the loan application qualifies as a proceeding related to the current action.Â  He cites Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 489 S.E.2d 472 (1997), and Quinn, 343 S.C. at 414-15, 540 S.E.2d at 476, in support of this broad view.Â  However, neither of these cases supports applying judicial estoppel in the present case.Â  In Hayne, the appellant in a divorce action claimed he had no legal interest in certain property owned by his son.Â  327 S.C. at 252, 489 S.E.2d at 477. Â He later contended he owned certain property by virtue of a resulting trust.Â  Id.Â  The court applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel to bar the appellant from claiming the property.Â  Id. at 252, 489 S.E.2d at 477 (â€œWhen a party has formally asserted a certain version of the facts in litigation, he cannot later change those facts when the initial version no longer suits him.â€).Â  In Quinn, the appellant had previously filed an answer and counterclaim\r\nadmitting his daughter owned and operated a corporation and stating that he had no authority to bind the corporation. Â 343 S.C. at 414-15, 540 S.E.2d at 476. Â In another case, the same appellant testified his daughter owned the corporation and denied that he owned any real estate, stocks, bonds, notes, or other valuable property. Â Id. at 415, 540 S.E.2d at 476.Â  Appellant then claimed, in a later action, that he was the sole owner of the corporation.Â  Id.Â  The court held appellantâ€™s later claim was barred by judicial estoppel because it directly contravened his assertions in the prior related litigations.Â  Id.Â Â  The Quinn court announced, Â Â â€œ[w]ere we to allow [appellant] to change his position as to the facts and now claim ownership of the Corporation, â€˜the truth-seeking function of the judicial process [would be] undermined.â€™ â€ Quinn, 343 S.C. at 415, 540 S.E.2d at 476.\r\nUnlike the circumstances in Hayne and Quinn, the loan application in which Wright asserted the Truck had value was not produced in any type of formal proceeding or litigation and was not a sworn statement.Â  Moreover, Craft, though a party to this litigation, was not a party to the loan application. Even broadly interpreting â€œsame or related,â€ the loan application cannot be considered the same or related to the current litigation and judicial estoppel does not apply to bar Wrightâ€™s claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Craft testified at trial that â€œsheet metal damageâ€ meant that the frame was not damaged.Â  \r\n[2] The record contains conflicting reports as to whether one or two airbags were replaced.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4182","title":"James v.

This is the most frequent cause of deformational posterior plagiocephaly, which results from progressive occipital flattening when a baby with torticollis is preferentially placed in [a] supine position.[5]Â  \r\n\r\nTo treat this condition, the Jameses sought pre-authorization from Blue Cross for a Dynamic Orthotic Cranioplasty Band, or DOC Band, for Meredith.Â  A DOC Band is similar to a helmet and is used to correct the shape of an infantâ€™s head.Â  Cranial Technologies, Inc., the supplier, described the device as follows in its documentation requesting pre-authorization approval for Meredith: \r\n\r\nThe DOCÂ® Band is an FDA approved medical device for the treatment of deformational plagiocephaly.Â  It is a non-invasive outpatient procedure used for correcting abnormal head shape in infants up to 18 months.Â  The procedure involves making a plaster cast of the infantâ€™s head and custom creating a band which is worn 23 hours a day.Â  The infant is monitored and the band is modified on a weekly or biweekly basis.Â  Average treatment time is 2-4 months.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe DOC Band is a six-ounce device consisting of an outer plastic shell with a foam lining, and mild pressure is applied to inhibit growth in prominent areas and encourage growth in flat areas.Â  The DOC Band is viable for about two to four months, and some children may require more than one band, depending on the age of the child and the severity of the deformity.Â  A DOC Band costs approximately $3,000.00.Â  The price is an all-inclusive fee that includes fabrication, adjustments to the DOC Band, and all patient visits.Â Â Â  \r\nBlue Cross denied coverage on the basis the treatment was purely for cosmetic purposes and was not medically necessary. Â The Jameses sought review by the Appeals Committee of EIP, which upheld the denial of coverage by letter of February 25, 2005 based on several provisions and exclusions in the State Health Plan.Â  The first provision is found in Article 2 of the State Health Plan, entitled â€œDEFINITIONS,â€ which defines medically necessary as follows:\r\n\r\n2.57 Medical Necessity; Medically Necessary or Necessary Service and Supply\r\nA service or supply that: \r\nA.Â  Is required to identify or treat an illness or injury; and\r\nB.Â  Is prescribed or ordered by a Physician, and\r\nC. Is consistent with the Covered Personâ€™s illness, injury, or condition, and in accordance with proper medical and surgical practices prevailing in the medical specialty or field of medicine at the time rendered; and\r\nD.Â  Is required for reasons other than the convenience of the patient.Â  The fact that a service is prescribed by a Physician does not necessarily mean that such service is Medically Necessary.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Appeals Committee of EIP relied on Article 9, entitled â€œEXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS,â€ which provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n9.1Â  No benefits will be provided under any Article of this Plan for any service, supply or charges for the following:\r\nA.Â  Any service or charge for service which is not Medically Necessary as defined in paragraph 2.57; any service or charge for service which is performed in a more costly setting than that required by a Covered Personâ€™s condition, in which case benefits will be limited to the benefits due had the services been performed in the least costly setting required by the Covered Personâ€™s condition;\r\nÂ . . . .\r\nJ.Â  Hospital and Physicians services and prescription drugs related to procedures or goods that have primarily cosmetic effects including but not limited to cosmetic surgery, or the complications resulting there from.Â  Cosmetic goods, procedures or surgery shall mean all goods, procedures, and surgical procedures performed to improve appearance or to correct a deformity without restoring a bodily function.Â  In the instances of the following and other procedures which might be considered â€œcosmeticâ€â€”e.g., rhinoplasty (nose), mentoplasty (chin), rhytidoplasty (face lift), glabellar rhytidoplasty, surgical planing (dermabrasion), blepharoplasty (eyelid), mammoplasty (suspension or augmentation), superficial chemosurgery (acid peel of the face) and rhytidectomy (abdomen, legs, hips, or buttocks including lipectomy or adipectomy)â€” benefits may only be provided when the malappearance or deformity was caused by physical trauma, surgery, or congenital anomaly (as opposed to familial characteristics or aging phenomenon) occurring after the Covered Personâ€™s Effective Date of coverage under this Plan or a Predecessor Plan; provided, however, that surgery to correct a cleft palette, or for restoration required because of burn injuries, or other similar procedures performed in stages or after certain growth has been attained, are not excluded because the physical trauma, surgery or congenital anomaly (as opposed to familial characteristics or aging phenomenon), occurred after the Covered Personâ€™s Effective Date of Coverage under this Plan or a Predecessor Plan . . . .Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nThe Appeals Committee of EIP concluded the DOC Band claims for Meredith dated February 6, 2004 and July 2, 2004 fell within these contractual exclusions.[6]Â  The Jameses appealed this determination to the circuit court, which reversed, finding the DOC Bands were medically necessary and within the scope of coverage.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 1-11-710(C) of the South Carolina Code provides that â€œclaims for benefits under any self-insured plan of insurance offered by the State to state and public school district employees and other eligible\r\nindividuals must be resolved by procedures established by the board [South Carolina Budget and Control Board], which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for these claims, subject only to appellate judicial review consistent with the standards provided in Section 1-23-380.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-11-710(C) (2005).Â  \r\nAfter the exhaustion of administrative remedies, an appeal for review may be made to the circuit court, which sits in an appellate capacity.Â  Under section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the Administrative Procedures Act (â€œAPAâ€), a reviewing court may reverse the decision of an agency upon the grounds, among others, that the decision is â€œaffected by [an] error of lawâ€ or is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) &amp; (e) (2005).Â  In addition, the decision may be reversed where it is â€œarbitrary or capricious or characterized by [an] abuse of discretion or [a] clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.â€Â  Id. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(f).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, EIP contends the circuit court erred in finding the administrative agencyâ€™s decision was clearly erroneous and not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn finding the DOC Bands were medically necessary and within the scope of the State Health Planâ€™s terms of coverage, the circuit court noted that Meredithâ€™s â€œtreating neurosurgeon, Dr. John Johnson[,] stated unequivocally that the application of the DOC Bands were â€˜medically necessaryâ€™ to correct her plagiocephaly.â€[7]Â  The court additionally noted:\r\n\r\nThe record further reflects that the childâ€™s condition was characterized by deformity of the skull, face and jaw.Â  The records from Dr. Johnson and notes from the Respondentâ€™s own internal Nurse Review both set forth that the treatment prescribed was purposed to remedy in part, â€œmusculoskeletal deformities of skull, face and jawâ€ of the infant.Â  As set forth in the medical research contained within the record, malocclusion of the mandible or jaw is a functional abnormality often associated with this defect and the DOC [B]and is a remedy prescribed to prevent development of this condition where the jaw, face and skull are malformed.Â  \r\n\r\nIn Bynum v. Cigna Healthcare of North Carolina, Inc., 287 F.3d 305 (4th Cir. 2002), the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, upheld an order of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina requiring coverage for a DOC Band to correct an infantâ€™s skull deformity.Â  Id. at 315.Â  The Fourth Circuit rejected the insurerâ€™s assertion that the DOC Band served only a cosmetic function and was not medically necessary and was, therefore, outside the scope of coverage in a claim governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (â€œERISAâ€).Â  Id. at 314.\r\nThe child in question, Katrina Bynum, was diagnosed with plagiocephaly directly related to congenital torticollis, which her treating pediatrician stated â€œis a medical condition[,] not a cosmetic condition.â€Â  Id. at 310.Â  Katrina had flattening on the right side of her head, her right ear was closer to the face than her left ear, and the right side of her head protruded outward greater than the left side.Â  Id. at 309-10 &amp; 310 n.8.Â  The Fourth Circuit found Katrinaâ€™s DOC Band was not cosmetic as it â€œwas not utilized for the sole purpose of providing her with an aesthetically pleasing, symmetrical head shape . . . .â€Â  Id. at 314.Â  â€œInstead, her DOC Procedure constituted treatment for a congenital birth defect and its related symptoms, with the added hope that it might prevent the onset of serious abnormalities associated with her birth defect, such as malocclusion of the mandible.â€Â  Id.Â  The court concluded the insurerâ€™s determination that the DOC Band was purely cosmetic â€œwas objectively unreasonable and not supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Id.\r\nÂ Â \r\nThe court also rejected the argument that the DOC Band was not covered because it was not medically necessary since it was not necessary â€œfor the . . . treatment, cure or relief of a Medical Condition, illness, injury or diseaseâ€ as defined by the health plan.Â  Id. at 315.Â  The court noted that â€œboth of Katrinaâ€™s treating physicians, a pediatrician and a pediatric neurosurgeon, opined that Katrinaâ€™s asymmetrical head shape was a medical condition requiring treatment.Â  And the uncontradicted medical evidence indicates that the appropriate treatment for Katrinaâ€™s medical condition was the DOC Procedure.â€Â  Id. at 315.\r\nThe court further concluded that the insurerâ€™s rejection of coverage, whether being based on the lack of medical necessity or on its being excluded as a cosmetic procedure, was not objectively reasonable and constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. Â The court stated that it was â€œleft with the definite and firm conviction that [the insurer] committed a clear error of judgment, and it thereby abused its discretionâ€ in this case.[8]Â  Id.  \r\nWe find this reasoning persuasive in the instant appeal and conclude its application is warranted here.Â  Article 9, paragraph J of the State Health Plan policy excludes coverage for procedures or goods that have primarily cosmetic effects, which it defines as follows:Â  â€œCosmetic goods, procedures or surgery shall mean all goods, procedures, and surgical procedures performed to improve appearance or to correct a deformity without restoring a bodily function.â€Â  Even where items are arguably cosmetic, however, benefits â€œmay . . . be provided when the malappearance or deformity was caused by physical trauma, surgery, or congenital anomaly . . . .â€Â  Â Â \r\nBefore Meredith was two months old, the Jameses noticed her eyes and ears did not look symmetrical.Â  One of her ears was a little smaller than the other and her eyes appeared to be of dissimilar size.Â  Her pediatrician at the time, Dr. Raymond Flanders, told them it could be the orbital bones that made the eyes appear different.Â Â Â  \r\nMeredith was ultimately diagnosed at ten and one-half months with plagiocephaly and torticollis.Â  At that point Meredith was seen by Dr. John Johnson, a neurosurgeon with the Southeastern Neurological and Spine Institute, who found Meredith had positional plagiocephaly.Â  Dr. Johnson wrote a prescription for a cranial molding device, the DOC Band, on February 2, 2004.Â  \r\nDr. Johnson, as Meredithâ€™s treating neurosurgeon, stated in a letter dated February 2, 2004, that Meredith was â€œfound to have a form of positional cranial deformity known as plagiocephaly.Â  This particular deformity may be corrected by the use of a cranial helm[e]t.Â  This device is used to [reshape] the distorted head shape of an infant so that hopefully surgery is avoided.Â  I strongly feel that this device is medically necessary for the treatment of this child.â€[9]Â  \r\nAs noted by the circuit court, â€œthe only physician who personally examined and treated the infant child stated unequivocally that the treatment was medically necessary.â€Â  Even the peer review analysis conducted at the request of Blue Cross noted that the DOC Band had improved not only â€œthe shape of the patientâ€™s headâ€ but also â€œthe degree of torticollisâ€ (twisted neck syndrome).Â  Cranial Technologies, the company producing the DOC Band, opined that use of the DOC Band â€œresults in normal to near normal head shape.Â  If left untreated, the infant can have persistent facial asymmetry, which can affect mandibular mechanics, jaw function, airway and orbital alignment.Â  For this reason, the DOC Band is deemed a medical necessity.â€Â  \r\nThe Jameses point out that the American Medical Association (â€œAMAâ€) has issued Resolution 119 (I-97), which states the AMA is aware that â€œ[i]nsurance companies . . . are increasingly denying insurance coverage for treatment of childrenâ€™s deformities, disfigurement and congenital defects, claiming that these services are non-functional and thus considered â€˜cosmeticâ€™ in nature and therefore declared a non-covered disorder.â€Â  See â€œCoverage of Childrenâ€™s Deformities, Disfigurement and Congenital Defects,â€ American Medical Association, Resolution 119 (I-97) &lt;www.ama-assn.org; www.cappskids.org/res119.pdf&gt;.Â  Resolution 119 affirmatively declares, however, the AMAâ€™s position is that correction of these facial anomalies is not cosmetic because it is performed on abnormal structures to restore them to a more normal state; further, correction is generally to improve function, although it may also be done to approximate a normal appearance.Â  Id.Â  The AMA stated â€œ[c]hildren who do not have birth defects and facial anomalies repaired face long-term physical and psychological injuries.â€Â  Id.Â  The AMA noted at least twelve states had passed legislation requiring insurance coverage for childrenâ€™s deformities or craniofacial surgery.Â  Id.\r\nThe AMA has also issued AMA Policy H-185.967, which declares â€œthat treatment of a minor childâ€™s congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to trauma or malignant disease should be covered by all insurersâ€ and â€œshall include treatment which, in the opinion of the treating physician, is medically necessary to return the patient to a more normal appearance . . . .â€Â  See â€œCoverage of Childrenâ€™s Deformities, Disfigurement and Congenital Defects,â€ American Medical Association, AMA Policy H-185.967 &lt;www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/hlth-ethics.pdf&gt;.Â  \r\nWe find EIPâ€™s assertion that coverage should be denied based on its averment that Meredith did not currently have severe mandible or other problems requiring surgery to be unpersuasive.Â  The position of the treating physician was that treatment would prevent the development of these problems and obviate the need for surgery.Â  In our view, it would not be reasonable to require a patient to delay medically-recognized, viable treatments until a problem becomes more severe before coverage applies.Â  \r\nFurther, we agree with the circuit court that, considering the record as a whole, reasonable minds would conclude treatment in this case is not primarily cosmetic, but rather, it does affect the functioning of the patient and it is medically necessary.Â  Cf. Baggott v. S. Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 5-6, 496 S.E.2d 852, 854-55 (1998) (finding substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the agencyâ€™s conclusion; the supreme court held substantial evidence did not support the agencyâ€™s determination to deny coverage because reasonable minds would conclude the claimantâ€™s injury did arise out of and in the scope of his employment).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the order of the circuit court finding the Jamesesâ€™ claim for insurance benefits relating to the DOC Band procedures should be approved.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We note the defendant in this action was previously misnamed in the pleadings as Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina; however, the circuit court, with the partiesâ€™ consent, â€œORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED, that the pleadings be amended to reflect that the State of South Carolina Employee Insurance Program [is] the [Defendant] in this action . . . .â€Â  Accordingly, we have made this amendment in the caption for this appeal.Â Â  Â \r\n[2] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  This definition appears in materials included in the record on â€œTorticollis and Related Issuesâ€ distributed by Dr. John M.

Saunders Publishing Company, Philadelphia PA, 2002.Â  See also Taberâ€™s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 1519 (17th ed. 1993) (defining plagiocephaly as â€œ[m]alformation of the skull producing the appearance of a twisted and lopsided headâ€).Â Â Â  Â \r\n[4] Â This definition appears in the article on â€œTorticollis and Related Issuesâ€ excerpted from Smithâ€™s Recognizable Pattern of Human Deformation and distributed by Dr. John M. Graham, Jr. of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.Â  See also Taberâ€™s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 2012 (17th ed. 1993) (discussing torticollis and its causes). \r\n[5]Â  This information is from the article on â€œTorticollis and Related Issues.â€Â  \r\n[6]Â  The Appeals Committee of EIP states in its report:Â  â€œIn summary, the Committee determined that there is no documentation of any neurologic or functional impairment associated with Meredithâ€™s condition.Â  Instead, the use of both DOC Bands was only to improve appearance.Â  Thus, no benefits are provided for Meredithâ€™s DOC Bands because the Plan of Benefits does not cover this service because it is not a medical necessity, any service or supply that is used to identify or treat an illness or injury and is not necessary to correct a functional deficit.Â  Accordingly, Meredithâ€™s February 6, 2004 and July 2, 2004 Doc [B]and claims fall[] within specific contractual exclusions.â€Â  The Jameses decided it was not in Meredithâ€™s best interest to wait for a response to their appeal, so they proceeded with the treatment.Â  They had two bands made, at a total cost of approximately $6,000.00.Â  \r\n[7]Â  The court stated Dr. Johnson was â€œthe only physician who personally examined and treated the infant childâ€ and observed that, in contrast, the evidence submitted by EIP to deny coverage consisted of the opinions of non-treating physicians from other states who never examined the child.Â  The peer review physicians engaged by Blue Cross reviewed portions of Meredithâ€™s medical records, but they did not personally examine her prior to making their recommendations to deny coverage.Â  \r\n[8]Â  The Fourth Circuit observed in Bynum that the insurer â€œpossessed a financial self-interest in defining â€˜cosmeticâ€™ in a broad manner,â€ as counsel for the insurer had acknowledged the company was â€œpresently facing an increasing number of benefit claims for DOC Procedures, because the number of infants with asymmetrical skulls is increasing due to current trends in post-natal positioning.â€Â  Id. at 312.Â  The court noted that parents were being advised to place infants on their backs to avoid Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (â€œSIDSâ€).Â  Id. at 312 n.15.Â  It has also been noted in the medical literature submitted for the current appeal that there has been an increased rate of plagiocephaly with the 1992 recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics to use back positioning as a way to reduce the incidence of SIDS.Â  Although the SIDS rate has declined approximately forty percent since that recommendation, the incidence of positional plagiocephaly has increased.Â  See, e.g., Persing, James, Swanson &amp; Kattwinkel, â€œPrevention and Management of Positional Skull Deformities in Infants,â€ American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Report, p. 199, Vol. 112, No. 1, July 2003.\r\n[9]Â  Dr. David Matthews, of the Department of Plastic Surgery, Head-Shape Screening Clinic, Cranial Technologies, completed a letter of June 3, 2004, along with an Initial History and Initial Physical of the same date, stating Meredithâ€™s abnormal head shape was noticed when Meredith was approximately one month old and that Meredith had positional plagiocephaly and torticollis.Â  Dr. Matthews recommended a second DOC Band to continue the treatment being administered by Dr. Johnson.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
