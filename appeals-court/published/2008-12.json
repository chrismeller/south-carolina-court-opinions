Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.:Â  The State\r\n  brought this action under the Sexually Violent Predator Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  44-48-10 to -170 (Supp. 2007), for a determination that Appellant was a\r\n  sexually violent predator in need of involuntary civil commitment in a secure\r\n  facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â  A jury found that\r\n  Appellant was a sexually violent predator, and the circuit court ordered that\r\n  Appellant be committed to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health.Â \r\n  Appellant challenges the commitment order on the ground that the circuit court\r\n  failed to charge the jury that Appellant had a constitutional right to decline\r\n  to take the witness stand.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\n    \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  June 24, 2002, Appellant pled guilty to one count of committing a lewd act upon\r\n  a child and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, suspended upon the\r\n  service of eight years and five years of probation.Â  While he was in prison,\r\n  Appellant entered an Alford plea to a second count of committing a lewd\r\n  act upon a child,[1] and, on January 22, 2003, he was sentenced to seven years in prison, to run\r\n  concurrently with the first sentence.Â  Prior to his release from prison, Appellant\r\n  was referred for review to determine if there was probable cause to believe\r\n  that he met the definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  The circuit court\r\n  determined that such probable cause existed and ordered Appellant to submit to\r\n  an evaluation pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80.Â  Following the evaluation,\r\n  the circuit court conducted a jury trial for a final determination of whether\r\n  Appellant met the definition of a sexually violent predator pursuant to S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 44-48-90.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State presented to the\r\n  jury the indictments and sentencing sheets for Appellantâ€™s two convictions for\r\n  sexually violent offenses.Â  Dr. Pamela Crawford, an expert in general\r\n  psychiatry and forensic psychiatry, testified about the significance of the two\r\n  events underlying the convictions.Â  Dr. Crawford expressed the opinion that\r\n  Appellant met the criteria for a diagnosis of pedophilia and alcohol dependence\r\n  and that he needed sex offender treatment.Â  She also stated that Appellant\r\n  presented a significant likelihood of a repeat offense.Â  \r\nAppellant presented the testimony of his\r\n  stepdaughter and the programs manager for the York County Detention Center.Â  The stepdaughter, who was eleven or twelve years old when Appellant began living with\r\n  her and her mother, stated that Appellant never acted inappropriately toward\r\n  her.Â  The York County employee testified that, while Appellant was in prison, he\r\n  had participated in the Life Skills program and also served as the chaplainâ€™s\r\n  assistant.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter all of the evidence was presented,\r\n  Appellantâ€™s counsel requested the circuit court to charge the jury that Appellant\r\n  had a right to decline to take the witness stand.Â  The circuit court denied the\r\n  request.Â  The jury later determined that Appellant was a sexually violent\r\n  predator, and the circuit court issued an order committing Appellant to the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Mental Health.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE ON APPEAL \r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court commit reversible error in refusing to charge the jury that Appellant had a constitutional\r\n  right to decline to take the witness stand?\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit\r\n  court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  McCourt\r\n    By and Through McCourt v. Abernathy,\r\n  318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606&nbsp;(1995).Â  The\r\n  law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at\r\n  trial.Â  State\r\n    v. Hill,\r\n  315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849&nbsp;(1993).Â  \r\nIn reviewing\r\n  jury charges for error, this Court must consider the circuit courtâ€™s jury\r\n  charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d\r\n  570, 575&nbsp;(1999). Â If, as a\r\n  whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which\r\n  might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  A jury\r\n  charge is correct if, when the charge is read as\r\n  a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  Id. at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574.Â  \r\nTo warrant\r\n  reversal, a circuit courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be\r\n  both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Patterson,\r\n  367 S.C. 219, 232, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that the circuit court erred when it denied counselâ€™s request to\r\n  instruct the jury that Appellant had a constitutional right to decline to take\r\n  the witness stand.Â  Appellant specifically argues that, as one subject to\r\n  proceedings under South\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act), he should have the same constitutional\r\n  rights as a criminal defendant because the same personal freedom is at stake.[2]Â \r\n  Appellant also argues that this omission prejudiced him because there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if the\r\n  circuit court had given the requested charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution sets forth the right against\r\n  self-incrimination as follows:Â  â€œNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\r\n  witness against himself . . . . â€Â  U.S. Const.\r\n  amend. V.Â  The South Carolina Constitution also provides for a right against\r\n  self-incrimination: Â â€œ[N]or shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness\r\n  against himself.â€Â  S.C. Const. art.\r\n  I, Â§ 12.Â  \r\nSimilarly, a witness in a civil action may\r\n  decline to answer a certain question if there is a reasonable possibility that the\r\n  answer would provide information that could be used against the witness in a\r\n  criminal proceeding or would lead to the discovery of such information.Â  See Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 377 S.C. 12, 24, 659 S.E.2d 112, 118&nbsp;(2008); see also State v.\r\n    Hook, 348 S.C. 401, 415, 559 S.E.2d 856, 863&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;2001) (quoting Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77-78 (1973) and stating that the Fifth\r\n  Amendment â€œnot only protects the individual against being involuntarily called\r\n  as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him\r\n  not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or\r\n  criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future\r\n  criminal proceedings.â€), modified on other grounds, 356 S.C. 421, 590 S.E.2d 25&nbsp;(2003).\r\nNonetheless, only\r\n  a criminal defendant has the right to decline to take the witness stand\r\n  altogether.Â  See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425\r\n  U.S. 308 (1976)\r\n  (citing prevailing rule that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid\r\n  adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify\r\n  in response to probative evidence offered against them and holding\r\n  that permitting an adverse inference to be drawn from an inmateâ€™s\r\n  silence at civil disciplinary proceedings is not, on its face, an invalid\r\n  practice). \r\nWhile the Act bestows some of the rights\r\n  normally associated with criminal prosecutions,[3] it is not intended to be punitive in nature; rather, it\r\n  sets forth a civil process for the commitment and treatment of sexually violent\r\n  predators. Â In\r\n    re Matthews,\r\n  345 S.C. 638, 649, 550 S.E.2d 311, 316&nbsp;(2001) (noting that, in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court deemed Kansasâ€™ Sexually Violent Predator Act, on which the\r\n  South Carolina Act is modeled, to be a civil, non-punitive scheme);[4] In re Care\r\n    and Treatment of Brown v. State, 372 S.C. 611, 616, 643 S.E.2d 118, 121&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;2007).Â  The Act is designed to: (1) meet the\r\n  special needs of sexually violent predators; (2) address the\r\n  significant likelihood that they will engage in repeated acts of sexual\r\n  violence if not treated for their mental conditions; and (3) assess the risks\r\n  requiring their involuntary civil commitment in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment. Â Id. at 616-617, 643 S.E.2d at 121&nbsp;(citing\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n44-48-20 (Supp. 2006)).Â  \r\nAppellant has not cited, nor has our\r\n  research revealed, any South Carolina authority to support his argument that there\r\n  exists a constitutional right to decline to take\r\n  the witness stand in a commitment trial under the Act.Â  Notably,\r\n  existing federal precedent indicates that there exists no such right under the\r\n  United States Constitution.Â  See Kansas v.\r\n    Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997) (stating that the State may take measures\r\n  to restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill and that such\r\n  restriction is a legitimate, non-punitive governmental objective); Allen v.\r\n    Illinois, 478 U.S. 364 (1986) (holding that proceedings under Illinoisâ€™\r\n  Sexually Dangerous Persons Act were not â€œcriminalâ€ within meaning of Fifth\r\n  Amendmentâ€™s guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination because commitment\r\n  to maximum security institution that also housed convicts needing psychiatric\r\n  care did not make conditions of personâ€™s confinement amount to â€œpunishmentâ€).[5]Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  any event, the omission of the requested charge did not prejudice Appellant.Â \r\n  Even if the circuit court had given the requested charge, the jury had before\r\n  it overwhelming evidence that Appellant met the statutory definition of a\r\n  sexually violent predator, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    â€œSexually\r\n      violent predatorâ€ means a person\r\n      who:\r\n    (a) has been\r\n      convicted of a sexually violent offense; and\r\n    (b) suffers from\r\n      a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to\r\n      engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for\r\n      long-term control, care, and treatment.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nThe evidence presented to the jury shows\r\n  that Appellant pled guilty to the sexual assault of a seven-year-old girl\r\n  between 1995 and 1996 and that he also entered an Alford plea to the sexual\r\n  assault of a child under the age of sixteen between the spring of 1995 and the\r\n  summer of 1996.Â  Dr. Crawford testified about the significance of the two\r\n  events underlying the convictions.Â  She stated that the events show a pattern\r\n  of behavior involving sexual contact with prepubescent girls.Â  Â Â \r\nDr. Crawford also gave her observations\r\n  from her interviews with Appellant.Â  She stated that Appellantâ€™s inconsistency\r\n  in his rendition of the events showed her that he did not appear to be fully\r\n  accepting responsibility for his actions.Â  Dr. Crawford also indicated that\r\n  Appellant was sexually aggressive, that he denied that he was sexually\r\n  attracted to children despite evidence of a series of events, and that he did\r\n  not believe that he needed sex offender treatment.Â  Â Â \r\nDr. Crawford expressed the opinion that\r\n  Appellant met the criteria for a diagnosis of pedophilia and alcohol dependence\r\n  and that he needed sex offender treatment.Â  Dr. Crawford explained that\r\n  pedophilia is typically a life-long behavioral disorder.Â  She also stated that\r\n  Appellantâ€™s pedophilia affects his ability to control his behavior, that he is\r\n  predisposed to commit future acts of sexual violence, and that he would present\r\n  a danger to prepubescent children.Â  Dr. Crawford expressed her opinion that\r\n  Appellant presented a significant likelihood of a repeat offense.Â  \r\nDr. Crawford acknowledged that approximately\r\n  one year had elapsed between her interviews with Appellant and the commitment\r\n  trial, and she qualified her opinions on that basis.Â  However, no expert\r\n  testimony was offered to assist the jury in determining whether Appellant had received\r\n  any professional treatment or had made any significant progress during that\r\n  one-year period.Â  Therefore, the jury was presented with overwhelming evidence\r\n  that Appellant met the definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s refusal to charge the jury that Appellant had a constitutional right to\r\n  decline to take the witness stand was neither erroneous nor prejudicial.Â  Under\r\n  the current law, there exists no constitutional right to decline to take the\r\n  witness stand in a civil proceeding, and it is not disputed that proceedings\r\n  under the Act are civil in nature.Â  Further, any adverse inference, permissible\r\n  or impermissible, that the jury might have drawn from Appellantâ€™s absence from\r\n  the witness stand would not be outcome determinative in light of the\r\n  overwhelming evidence that Appellant met the Actâ€™s definition of a sexually\r\n  violent predator.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See North\r\n  Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), which discusses the acceptance of a\r\nguilty plea from a defendant who maintains his innocence.\r\n[2] Appellant\r\n  concedes that the commitment of a sexually violent predator under the Act is\r\ncivil in nature.\r\n[3] The Act\r\n  provides for a\r\n  probable cause hearing, the assistance of counsel, a jury trial, the right to\r\n  cross-examine witnesses, and the right to view and copy all petitions and\r\n  reports in the court file.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80 (Supp. 2007).Â  Additionally,\r\n  the Act adopts the burden of proof required in criminal prosecutions; S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-100(A) (Supp. 2007) requires that a determination of whether one\r\n  is a sexually violent predator be made only upon proof beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.Â  \r\n[4] In Matthews,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court found that the appellant did not effectively\r\n  distinguish the Kansas Act from South Carolinaâ€™s Act; therefore, South Carolinaâ€™s Act violated neither the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States\r\n  Constitution nor that of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Matthews, 345\r\nS.C. at 649-51, 550 S.E.2d at 316-17.Â  \r\n[5]See also Joan\r\n  Comparet-Cassani, A Primer on the Civil Trial of a Sexually Violent Predator,\r\n  37 San Diego L.

County of Beaufort, 373 S.C.\r\n  55, 59, 644 S.E.2d 675, 677 (2007).Â  Statutory interpretation is a question of\r\n  law.Â  State v. Sweat, 379 S.C. 367, 373, 665 S.E. 2d 645, 648 (Ct.

Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Bid Interest Under Sections 12-51-90, 12-51-100, and 12-51-150 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code\r\nSoutheastern contends the special referee erred in finding it\r\n  liable to Crusader for bid interest pursuant to section 12-51-90 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) because the tax sale was voided once Southeastern\r\n  was declared tax exempt for 2002.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  section 12-51-90(A), the defaulting taxpayer may redeem the affected property\r\n  within the redemption period by paying delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs, together with\r\n  interest as provided in subsection (B).Â  Subsection (B) requires the delinquent\r\n  taxpayer to remit interest on the tax sale bid amount in accordance with the\r\n  schedule set forth.Â  For property redeemed in the final three months of the\r\n  redemption period, the interest rate is twelve percent.Â  Section 12-51-100 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2000) dictates what happens when the redemption is\r\n  instituted:Â  â€œThe successful purchaser, at the delinquent tax sale, shall\r\n  promptly be notified by mail to return the tax sale receipt to the person\r\n  officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in order to be\r\n  expeditiously refunded the purchase price plus the interest provided in\r\n    Section 12-51-90.â€ (emphasis added).\r\nSection\r\n  12-51-150 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) governs the procedure for\r\n  voiding a tax sale:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIf the official in charge of the tax sale discovers before a tax\r\n  title has passed that there is a failure of any action required to be properly\r\n  performed, the official may void the tax sale and refund the amount paid, plus\r\n  interest in the amount actually earned by the county on the amount refunded, to\r\n  the successful bidder.Â  If the full amount of the taxes, assessments,\r\n  penalties, and costs have not been paid, the property must be brought to tax sale\r\n  as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe statutory\r\n  framework for tax sales does not seem to contemplate the precise situation\r\n  presented in this case.Â  The interest provision of section 12-51-90(B) is\r\n  intended to encourage the prompt payment of delinquent taxes and to penalize the\r\n  delinquent taxpayer for delay.Â  Furthermore, the interest provision is an\r\n  incentive for purchasers to bid on tax sale property even though there is risk\r\n  involved that the property could be redeemed or the sale voided altogether.[3]\r\nOnce the redemption\r\n  was accomplished by Southeastern under section 12-51-90, the terms of section 12-51-100\r\n  were triggered, and Crusader was entitled to the twelve percent interest on its\r\n  bid.Â  Section 12-51-150 does not provide that the official in charge of conducting\r\n  the sale can void the sale because taxes were wrongfully assessed and the\r\n  property was tax exempt. Â It only addresses situations in which the sale was\r\n  not properly conducted.Â  We decline to read more into the statute than can be\r\n  discerned from its plain language.Â  See Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 276, 625 S.E.2d 636, 640\r\n  (2006) (finding the court cannot impose another meaning on plain statutory\r\n  language).Â  Therefore, we cannot conclude\r\n  the sale was void pursuant to section 12-51-150.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  as Southeastern points out, section\r\n  12-4-730 of the South Carolina Code (2000) permits the county auditor to â€œvoid\r\n  any tax notice applicable to the propertyâ€ once notified by the department that\r\n  a property is exempt from ad valorem taxes.Â  We\r\n  do not find it necessary to determine whether the auditor could retroactively\r\n  void the tax notice thereby nullifying the sale.Â  The record shows Southeastern\r\n  did not pay, nor did it attempt to pay, the 2001 back taxes until after the tax\r\n  sale.Â  It is undisputed Southeastern was ultimately responsible for paying\r\n  those taxes.Â  The county was within its rights to proceed with a sale of the\r\n  subject property based on the outstanding taxes owed for 2001.Â  The failure to\r\n  pay the undisputedly due taxes validates the sale even if the tax notice for\r\n  the 2002 taxes was retroactively voided.Â  Consequently, the sale was valid, the\r\n  redemption was valid, and the subsequent determination of tax exempt status for\r\n  2002 did not affect the sale.Â  The tax exempt determination entitled Southeastern\r\n  to the refund of taxes assessed for 2002, but did not render the requirements\r\n  under sections 12-51-90 and 12-51-100 ineffective.Â  Therefore, we find the\r\n  special referee correctly concluded Southeastern was required to pay the bid\r\n  interest to the County of Laurens to be remitted to Crusader.\r\nThe\r\n  County argues it should not be responsible for payment of the bid interest to\r\n  Crusader.Â  We agree.Â  Under the statute, the person officially charge with the\r\n  collection of delinquent taxes should â€œexpeditiously refund the purchase price\r\n  plus the interest provided in Section 12-51-90.â€Â  Â§ 12-51-100.Â  Under section 12-51-90,\r\n  it is the defaulting taxpayer, in this case Southeastern, who is responsible\r\n  for paying the bid interest.Â  The County, under the statute, is responsible\r\n  for remitting the paid money to the bidder as part of the redemption process.Â  \r\nOur analysis with\r\n  respect to the Countyâ€™s liability must be performed in light of another case\r\n  from this court, H &amp; K Specialists v. Brannen, 340 S.C. 585, 532\r\n  S.E.2d 617 (2000).Â  In H &amp; K Specialists, the Beaufort County\r\n  treasurer provided improper notice regarding the tax sale of the property.Â  Id. at 586, 532 S.E.2d at 618.Â  After the title to the property had passed to the\r\n  successful bidder, H&amp;K, the treasurer set aside the sale and refunded the\r\n  purchase price less the tax delinquency to the defaulting taxpayers, the\r\n  Brannens.Â  Id.Â  H&amp;K then sued Beaufort County for the return of its\r\n  purchase price plus statutory interest as provided under the redemption\r\n  statute. Â Id.Â  In finding the County liable for the funds, the court\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n\tFinally,\r\n  we are mindful of the fact that the master based his decision, in part, on the\r\n  fact that the Brannens received both the property and the money and thus\r\n  H&amp;Kâ€™s sole remedy was against the Brannens.Â  However, it was the Beaufort\r\n  County Respondents which created this inequitable situation by failing to\r\n  provide the Brannens with the proper notice that resulted in the tax sale being\r\n  set aside and erred in refunding the purchase price, less the tax delinquency,\r\n  to the Brannens rather than to H&amp;K.Â  Therefore, we do not believe H&amp;K\r\n  is limited to pursuing a legal remedy solely against the Brannens. \r\n\r\nId. at 589, 532 S.E.2d at 619-20.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the County does not appear to be responsible for the inequity that\r\n  has resulted to the parties.Â  Southeastern neglected to pay its 2001 taxes and\r\n  was not as diligent as it should have been in ascertaining the status of its\r\n  tax exemption for 2002.Â  Had Southeastern paid the taxes due and then sought a\r\n  refund, the property would not have been sold, thereby avoiding the present\r\n  scenario.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  County was faced with a legitimate conundrum in light of the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  notice of tax exemption being issued almost simultaneously with the\r\n  redemption.Â  The County consulted its legal counsel, and based on that advice\r\n  proceeded to refund the 2002 taxes and the bid interest paid to Southeastern\r\n  believing the sale to be legally void at that time.Â  The County then attempted\r\n  to return the purchase price to Crusader as mandated and was willing to return\r\n  the interest actually earned.Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  do not find statutory authority for requiring the County to pay the bid\r\n  interest to Crusader, and we find the present facts distinguishable from those\r\n  present in H&amp;K Specialists so that the County should not be found\r\n  jointly and severally liable with Southeastern for the bid interest.Â \r\n  Therefore, we conclude the bid interest was properly due to Crusader under\r\n  section 12-51-100, but only Southeastern, the defaulting taxpayer thereunder,\r\n  is liable for payment.\r\nII.&nbsp; Statutory Prejudgment\r\n  Interest on the Bid Interest\r\nCrusader\r\n  contends the special referee erred in denying its request for statutory\r\n  prejudgment interest on the bid interest it was due under the redemption\r\n  statute.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nSection 34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) provides\r\n  â€œ[i]n all cases of accounts\r\n  stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained\r\n  and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest\r\n  shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per annum.â€ (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Prejudgment interest is allowed if the sum is certain or capable of\r\n  being reduced to certainty based on a mathematical calculation previously\r\n  agreed to by the parties.Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court St., LLC,\r\n  369 S.C. 121, 133, 631 S.E.2d 252, 258-59 (2006).Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the sum due to Crusader was the bid interest\r\n  under the redemption statute.Â  Although the bid interest ultimately would be\r\n  paid to Crusader, the statute required the money first pass from Southeastern through\r\n  the County.Â  According to the County, the bid interest was no longer due and\r\n    owing.Â  Consequently, the sum was removed from the purview of section\r\n  34-31-20(A), and Crusader is not entitled to statutory prejudgment interest.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Statutory Interest\r\n  on the Bid \r\nThe County contends the special referee erred\r\n  in awarding Crusader $25,375 in interest on Crusader's $348,000 bid.Â  We agree.\r\nThe special\r\n  referee awarded statutory prejudgment interest pursuant to section 34-31-20(A) for the period of time in\r\n  which the County held Crusader's bid money while awaiting return of the tax\r\n  sale receipt.Â  According to section 12-51-100, &quot;[t]he successful purchaser, at the delinquent tax sale,\r\n  shall promptly be notified by mail to return the tax sale receipt to the person\r\n  officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in order to be\r\n    expeditiously refunded the purchase price plus the interest provided in section\r\n  12-51-90.&quot; (emphasis added).Â  Thus, as\r\n  a condition precedent to return of the bid, the bidder is required to return\r\n  the tax sale receipt.Â  Therefore, we find\r\n  the County is not liable for prejudgment interest on Crusader's bid for the\r\n  time in which Crusader retained the tax sale receipt after notification by the\r\n  County.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find Southeastern liable for the bid interest due to Crusader pursuant to\r\n  section 12-51-100, but\r\n  Southeastern is not responsible for statutory prejudgment interest.Â  We\r\n  conclude this case is distinguishable from H &amp; K Specialists so that\r\n  the County is not responsible for payment of the bid interest or statutory\r\n  prejudgment interest.Â  We further find the County is not liable for prejudgment\r\n  interest on Crusader's bid for the time in which Crusader retained the tax sale\r\n  receipt.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This was a clear overbid for the property. \r\n[2] The record is unclear whether Southeastern may have\r\n  at some point been declared tax exempt for the year 2001, but it is undisputed\r\n  that Southeastern was assessed the taxes, failed to pay them in a timely\r\n  manner, and was ultimately found liable for the ad valorem taxes\r\n  for 2001.Â  \r\n[3] We recognize section 12-51-150 provides the bidder is\r\n  entitled to the interest actually accrued on the bid amount in the event the\r\n  sale is voided.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4465","title":"Trey Gowdy v.

Gordon, 359 S.C. 572, 598 S.E.2d 288 (2004),â€\r\n  which recognized a totality of the circumstances analysis for determining\r\n  probable cause.Â  The court cited the close proximity of the money to evidence of\r\n  illegal drug activity, Gibsonâ€™s history of drug activity, and the failure to\r\n  provide a plausible explanation for a legitimate source for the funds as a\r\n  basis for its ruling.Â  The court also relied on the credibility of the\r\n  testifying officers to determine the forfeiture was appropriate.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action for\r\n  forfeiture of property is a civil action at law.â€Â  Pope v.

The Stateâ€™s Case Under Section 44-53-520 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code[1]\r\nThe Gibsons contend the State failed to establish the seized funds\r\n  were in close proximity to evidence of illegal drug activity or were traceable\r\n  to illegal drug activity.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe purpose of a forfeiture hearing is to\r\n  confirm the state had probable cause to seize the property in question.

Toys â€œRâ€ Us - Del.,\r\n      Inc., 375 S.C. 604, 616-17, 654 S.E.2d 541, 548 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (citing Jones v. City of Columbia, 301 S.C. 62, 65, 389\r\n  S.E.2d 662, 663 (1990)).Â  \r\nSection 44-53-520 of the South Carolina Code (2002 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2007) enumerates what property is subject to forfeiture in a criminal\r\n  action.Â  Sub-parts (7) and (8) are the sub-parts of concern to us in this\r\n  case.Â  \r\n\r\n  (a) The following are\r\n    subject to forfeiture . . . \r\n  \r\n  (7) all property\r\n    including, but not limited to, monies, negotiable instruments, securities, or\r\n    other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in\r\n    exchange for a controlled substance, and all proceeds including, but not\r\n    limited to, monies, and real and personal property traceable to any exchange;\r\n  (8) all monies seized in close proximity\r\n    to forfeitable controlled substances, drug manufacturing, or distributing\r\n    paraphernalia, or in close proximity to forfeitable records of the importation,\r\n    manufacturing, or distribution of controlled substances and all monies seized\r\n    at the time of arrest or search involving violation of this article. If\r\n    the person from whom the monies were taken can establish to the satisfaction of\r\n    a court of competent jurisdiction that the monies seized are not products of\r\n    illegal acts, the monies must be returned pursuant to court order.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThe Gibsons contend the relationship\r\n  between the locations of the money and the drugs and drug paraphernalia did not\r\n  constitute close proximity as contemplated by the statute.Â  No South Carolina cases discuss precisely how close proximity is to be measured.Â  However, we\r\n  do not find it necessary to determine what distance constitutes close proximity\r\n  for purposes of sub-part (8).Â  Although the circuit court stated the money was\r\n  found in close proximity to evidence of illegal drug activity, that finding is\r\n  not the sole basis for the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Rather, proximity appears to be one\r\n  of several factors the court considered in determining the money was\r\n  â€œtraceableâ€ to illegal drug activity under sub-part (7).Â  \r\nTherefore, we turn our attention to whether the State\r\n  established probable cause the money was traceable to illegal drug activity.Â  Traceability\r\n  was recently discussed by our supreme court in Pope v. Gordon,\r\n  369 S.C. 469, 633 S.E.2d 148 (2006).Â  In that case, police seized a business bank\r\n  account of the claimant, who was convicted of trafficking in cocaine.Â  Id. at 473, 633 S.E.2d at 150.Â  The State presented evidence Gordon paid for his\r\n  monthly rent in cash and did not file tax returns for 1995 and 1996.Â  Id. at 475, 633 S.E.2d at 151-52. Â The State further contended Gordonâ€™s expenses\r\n  exceeded his business income.Â  Id. at 475-76, 633 S.E.2d at 152.Â  The\r\n  court concluded:Â  \r\n\r\n  The record shows that [Gordon] did have a legitimate car\r\n    detailing business that involved cash transactions.Â  In addition, the bank\r\n    records show that money in the accounts came from the car detailing business.Â \r\n    As a result, the State failed to demonstrate how the money contained in the\r\n    bank account came from illegal drug transactions.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 476, 633 S.E.2d at 152.\r\nThe Pope court went on to reject a totality of the circumstances approach set forth in United\r\n  States v. Thomas, 913 F.2d 1111 (4th Cir. 1990).Â  In Thomas, the fourth\r\n  circuit examined the governmentâ€™s evidence in toto in determining there\r\n  was probable cause to seize certain property of Thomasâ€™ including a $25,000\r\n  bond.Â  Id. at 1114-15, 1117.Â  The court considered Thomasâ€™ unusual\r\n  travel patterns, one-way trips to Miami, prior drug activity, and excessive\r\n  expenditures for his legitimate income.Â  Id. at 1115-17.Â  The court\r\n  concluded the evidence, â€œ[i]n its totality,â€ strongly implicated Thomas in\r\n  illegal drug activity.Â  Id. at 1117.Â  In rejecting this approach our\r\n  supreme court stated: â€œ[W]e decline to use the rationale in Thomas because\r\n  we believe the standard in Thomas would lessen the burden on the State\r\n  and is in direct contravention to the word traceable in the language of the\r\n  statute.â€Â  Pope, 369 S.C. at 476, 633 S.E.2d at 152.Â  \r\nWith all the\r\n  foregoing in mind, we find this case to be distinguishable from Thomas and Pope.Â  As previously discussed, the money in this case was found\r\n  hidden in the ceiling of Gibsonâ€™s bedroom, and drugs and drug paraphernalia\r\n  were discovered on the property.Â  Furthermore, the drug dog at the scene\r\n  alerted to the safe indicating the safe or its contents had at some point in\r\n  time been in contact with illegal narcotics.Â  Additionally, drugs were found at\r\n  the beauty shop, another location under Gibsonâ€™s control.\r\nWhile our\r\n  analysis does look at several pieces of evidence, we do not believe this is the\r\n  type of totality of the circumstances analysis set forth in Thomas and\r\n  disapproved of in Pope.Â  We believe the evidence presented in this case\r\n  is much more compelling and does not require making the kinds of assumptions\r\n  that would have been required in Pope.Â  Drugs were found on the same\r\n  property with the money.Â  The funds were hidden in a location that was\r\n  inaccessible to the alleged owner.Â  Mrs. Gibson made no claim to the money at\r\n  the time it was seized and, very significantly, the drug dog alerted on the\r\n  safe making it more likely than not the money and/or the safe had been in\r\n  contact with drugs.[2]\r\nWe think it\r\n  important to note, Pope is factually distinguishable from the case sub\r\n    judice.Â  The money at issue in Pope was in a business bank account,\r\n  which would necessitate tracing the funds through some type of documentation or\r\n  testimony the money was not the product of legitimate business.Â  In this case,\r\n  the actual currency was found during the execution of a search warrant seeking\r\n  illegal drugs.Â Â  \r\nIn Pope,\r\n  the court expressed concern over lessening the burden on the State to prove its\r\n  case.Â  We agree mere suspicion and innuendo should not be mistaken for the\r\n  establishment of probable cause.Â  However, the State was not required to prove with\r\n  certainty the money was connected to illegal drug transactions.Â  The statute\r\n  requires the State to establish probable cause the seized money was traceable\r\n  to drug activity.Â  We believe, under the particularized circumstances of this\r\n  case, the State met its burden.\r\nII. The Gibsonsâ€™\r\n  Rebuttal\r\nThe Gibsons\r\n  further argue they satisfied the burden of showing by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence the money belonged to Mrs. Gibson and constituted her life savings.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIf probable cause is shown, the burden\r\n  shifts to the owner to show by the preponderance of the evidence that he or she\r\n  â€˜was not a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the\r\n  use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.â€™â€ Â Â Medlock,\r\n  322 S.C. at 131, 470\r\n  S.E.2d at 376 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-586(b)(1) (Supp.\r\n  1994)).Â  \r\nMrs. Gibson was\r\n  under a higher burden than the State and was required to prove her claim to the\r\n  money by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Mrs. Gibson testified the money seized\r\n  was her life savings.Â  She testified she had worked at the same company for\r\n  twenty-seven years and at the time of trial earned $14.33 per hour.Â  Mrs.\r\n  Gibson indicated she sometimes worked as much as sixty hours per week being\r\n  paid time-and-a-half for any time over forty hours.Â  Mrs. Gibson also claimed\r\n  she had some money from illegal gambling.Â  She testified she did not keep the\r\n  money in the bank because she had lost money that way before and the safe was\r\n  in the attic because it would be safer in the event of a break-in.Â  Mrs. Gibson\r\n  admitted she could not access the safe herself and did not know the\r\n  combination.\r\nMrs. Gibson was\r\n  unable to provide any documentation regarding a legitimate source for the money\r\n  or to in any way rebut the evidence presented by the state the money was\r\n  connected to illegal drug activity.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court did not\r\n  find Gibson or Mrs. Gibson to be credible regarding their explanation for the\r\n  money.Â  Although not bound by that conclusion, we generally defer to the\r\n  findings of the trial judge in that regard.Â  See USAA Prop. &amp;\r\n    Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 652-53, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2008)\r\n  (â€œ[N]oting the circuit court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in a\r\n  better position to evaluation their credibility and assign comparative weight\r\n  to their testimony.â€) (citing Reed v. Ozmint, 374 S.C. 19, 24, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 209, 211 (2007)). \r\nFor all of the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the determination of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The discussion in this section encompasses the third\r\n  issue raised on appeal regarding the trial courtâ€™s use of the standard set\r\nforth in Pope v.

McCall appeals from an order of the\r\n  circuit court finding him entitled to damages of $24,379.33 on his breach of\r\n  contract action against IKON Educational Services.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nThis matter originally came before this court on IKONâ€™s appeal\r\n  from the denial of relief from a default judgment against it and in favor of\r\n  McCall.Â  Finding IKON did not receive sufficient notice of the damages hearing,\r\n  we remanded the matter to the circuit court for a new hearing on damages.Â  McCall\r\n    v. IKON, 363 S.C. 646, 611 S.E.2d 315 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nDuring this hearing, the parties presented evidence that in\r\n  November 2001, McCall signed an agreement with IKON for an â€œEnterprise Training Pass,â€ entitling him to twelve months of unlimited course attendance at any\r\n  scheduled IKON public systems training course in certain specified areas,\r\n  including Microsoft, Novell and Lotus.Â  McCall entered the course of study with\r\n  the goal of becoming a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, and paid IKON\r\n  tuition of $12,500.Â  At that time, McCall held a Bachelorâ€™s degree in biology,\r\n  as well as a Masterâ€™s degree in forestry, and had worked for a number of years\r\n  in the forestry related area.\r\nIn order to become a certified Microsoft Systems Engineer, McCall\r\n  needed to pass tests in seven different courses that were administered by an\r\n  independent agency.Â  McCall began attending IKON classes on November 19, 2001,\r\n  and completed three courses.Â  He subsequently passed two of the seven required\r\n  tests.Â  However, IKON sold the company to CESC in the last quarter of 2001 and,\r\n  thereafter, on January 2, 2002, CESC chose to cease operating in the Greenville area.\r\nAfter learning of the closing, McCall went to the training\r\n  facility and requested a refund of $12,500.Â  On January 9, 2002, McCall filed\r\n  the present breach of contract action, against IKON and CESC.Â  McCall,\r\n  363 S.C. at 650, 611 S.E.2d at 316.Â Â  On January 24, 2002, Clint Babcock sent\r\n  McCall an e-mail with a document attached, requesting McCall sign and return\r\n  the form to â€œcesc/IKON Educationâ€ if he agreed to the terms.Â  The document\r\n  offered a refund to McCall in exchange for McCall signing a release.[1]Â  McCall testified he did not consider\r\n  the document an offer, â€œbecause [he] never saw the check.â€\r\nThereafter, McCall began looking for a job and ultimately went to\r\n  work for Schneider Tree Care as a consulting arborist in July 2002, where he\r\n  earned approximately $35,000 a year.Â  He continued his employment with\r\n  Schneider until June 2004, at which time McCall left that job in order to\r\n  pursue a Ph.D. in horticulture at Clemson University.Â  McCall stated he worked\r\n  as a graduate assistant while pursuing that degree, earning about $7,500,\r\n  however, the program was discontinued within six months due to lack of research\r\n  funding and McCallâ€™s position was terminated.[2]Â \r\n  On March 21, 2005, McCall began work with the North Carolina Forest Service,\r\n  earning $33,942 a year.Â  In May 2003, during the time he was working at\r\n  Schneiderâ€™s and well before he entered the Ph.D. program, McCall received a\r\n  settlement of $25,000 from CESC. [3]\r\nMcCall admitted that in January 2002, he was aware of two or three\r\n  other courses available in the area that were sufficient for him to obtain the\r\n  certification he sought and were less expensive.Â  He further agreed that after\r\n  CESC stopped providing training in the area in January 2002, he did not enroll\r\n  in any of the other available computer classes.Â  McCall claimed, however, that\r\n  his lack of funds, created by the actions of IKON, kept him out of a career in\r\n  computers.Â  He asserted at trial that he was entitled to damages of $12,500\r\n  plus prejudgment interest for the tuition he paid, lost wages for a period of\r\n  six months, and interest of six percent incurred on the money borrowed for the\r\n  tuition. \r\nMcCall further presented Dr. Charles Alford as an expert witness\r\n  in economics and business valuation.[4]Â \r\n  Dr. Alford testified he computed the present value difference between a\r\n  projection of lifetime earnings McCall would have received had he entered a\r\n  career in the computer field as opposed to a projection of lifetime earnings in\r\n  the forestry field in which McCall was currently working.Â  Dr. Alford compared\r\n  McCallâ€™s current wages of $33,942 in forestry and his projected future earnings\r\n  were he to stay with his current job against data from a South Carolina\r\n  Occupational Employment and Wage report indicating the projected income of\r\n  someone working as a systems administrator in the computer field at the time\r\n  McCall would have finished the IKON program, along with his projected future\r\n  income in that field.Â  He opined that if McCall had become a computer systems\r\n  engineer, he would receive $340,406 more in lifetime income and fringe benefits\r\n  than he would if he remained a forester.\r\nOn cross-examination, Dr. Alford admitted he was not a vocational\r\n  expert and was not qualified to determine employability.Â  He testified he based\r\n  his determination on projections for a network and systems administrator\r\n  because McCall had identified that as his career objective, but agreed McCall\r\n  had no employment history in the computer field and acknowledged he was not\r\n  willing to offer testimony that McCall could have been employed as such.Â  Dr.\r\n  Alford also agreed his figures did not include starting McCall out at projected\r\n  entry level earnings for a forester because he knew McCallâ€™s actual earnings at\r\n  that time.Â  He further admitted he did not take into account in the forestry\r\n  earnings projection that McCall had years of experience as well as a Masterâ€™s\r\n  degree in forestry.Â  He consistently stated that if the court were to determine\r\n  McCall did not earn as much as he could have earned in the forestry field, the\r\n  figures should be adjusted or â€œthe whole thing [should] be set aside.â€\r\nDr. Benson Hecker testified on behalf of IKON as an expert in the\r\n  area of vocational evaluation.Â  Dr. Hecker testified, as a vocational\r\n  evaluation specialist, he looked at a personâ€™s age, education, vocational\r\n  background and skills, along with the job market to â€œput together an opinion\r\n  regarding a personâ€™s capacity to earn money,â€ to aid the court in determining a\r\n  personâ€™s employability and salary levels.Â  After reviewing information on\r\n  McCall relative to these factors, as well as obtaining information from The\r\n  U.S. Department of Labor Statistics showing State Occupation and Employment\r\n  Wage Estimates for South Carolina, and further contacting Clemson University\r\n  with regard to salary levels, Dr. Hecker was of the opinion that McCall would\r\n  suffer no loss of earning capacity as a result of the cancellation of the\r\n  computer program.Â  \r\nIn reaching his conclusion, Dr. Hecker opined McCall could have\r\n  entered the forestry field in North Carolina at the mean salary level rather\r\n  than at entry level, and determined the appropriate figure to use for\r\n  determining McCallâ€™s expected salary in forestry was the mean salary level of\r\n  between $51,000 and $52,000 based on McCallâ€™s experience and background.Â  Dr.\r\n  Hecker further testified it was his opinion McCallâ€™s failure to take the refund\r\n  offered in January 2002 delayed his completion of a program and continuation of\r\n  his education, and further delayed his entry into the job market.Â  Had McCall\r\n  been dedicated to entering the computer field, he reasonably would have\r\n  accepted the offer and continued his education.Â  As a result, there would be no\r\n  loss.Â  Additionally, Dr. Hecker noted McCallâ€™s receipt of the $25,000\r\n  settlement proceeds in May 2003 and his failure to continue his education in\r\n  the computer field at that time indicated McCallâ€™s desire to work in the\r\n  forestry industry instead of the computer field.Â  It was his opinion that the\r\n  best occupational career path for McCall was, and continued to be, in the\r\n  forestry field.Â  According to Dr. Hecker, Dr. Alfordâ€™s present value\r\n  calculations were of no import because he was of the opinion McCall suffered\r\n  â€œno loss of earning, no loss of wages.â€\r\nIKON also presented the testimony of Peter Tiffany, a Certified\r\n  Public Accountant.Â  Mr. Tiffany was offered and qualified as an expert in the\r\n  area of computation of present values.Â  Given the $52,000 mean salary figure\r\n  for foresters in Dr. Heckerâ€™s report, Mr. Tiffany used the same inflation\r\n  rates, growth rates and discount rates as Dr. Alford used in his analysis to\r\n  project present value and determined, using the same assumption as Dr. Alford\r\n  for the projected present value of earnings in the computer field, that the\r\n  projected earnings in the forestry industry would be greater than those in the\r\n  computer industry, resulting in no loss of earning capacity for McCall.Â  Mr.\r\n  Tiffany likewise performed the same calculations based on an average $40,000\r\n  starting salary range for foresters, taken from Dr. Heckerâ€™s report indicating\r\n  such starting range is between $35,000 and $45,000, as well as on a mean salary\r\n  range of $49,538 taken from an exhibit from Dr. Alfordâ€™s deposition.Â  In both\r\n  cases, the present values of the forestry earnings compared to the computer\r\n  earnings resulted in a negative net result, showing no loss of earnings in the\r\n  forestry field compared to the computer industry.\r\nBased on the evidence presented, the circuit court found McCall\r\n  was entitled to damages in the amount of $24,379.33.Â  The court held the\r\n  testimony of IKONâ€™s witnesses was more reliable, credible, and persuasive, and\r\n  that Dr. Alfordâ€™s opinion was not â€œreliable or probative on the issue of\r\n  damages.â€Â  The court noted, although McCall testified of his desire to pursue a\r\n  career in computers, there was little evidence to support this assertion, the\r\n  vast majority of McCallâ€™s education and employment was in forestry related\r\n  fields, and McCallâ€™s â€œforay in the computer fieldâ€ only lasted for approximately\r\n  one month.Â  The court further considered that Dr. Alford, who admitted he is\r\n  not a vocational expert, based his opinion as to McCallâ€™s vocational aptitude\r\n  entirely upon McCallâ€™s â€œbeliefs as to his desires,â€ and based his calculations\r\n  of lost earnings in the computer field on a position McCall was merely â€œhoping\r\n  to obtain.â€Â  Because of the improper foundation on which Dr. Alford based his\r\n  opinion as to the $340,406 difference in projected lifetime earnings between\r\n  the two fields, the circuit court determined Dr. Alfordâ€™s testimony did not\r\n  provide persuasive evidence of McCallâ€™s loss of earnings or loss of earning\r\n  capacity.\r\nOn the other hand, the court found Dr. Hecker, who is a vocational\r\n  expert, considered the fact that comparable programs for computer study were\r\n  available to McCall both in January 2002 when he was offered a refund, and May\r\n  2003 when he received the $25,000 settlement, yet McCall chose not to pursue\r\n  any training in the computer field.Â  Thus, it was reasonable to assume McCallâ€™s\r\n  interests actually rested in the forestry field.Â  The court agreed with Dr.\r\n  Hecker that McCallâ€™s best vocational path was in the forestry related field and\r\n  it would therefore be speculative to make a mathematical comparison of\r\n  projected incomes between the computer and forestry fields.Â  The court further\r\n  found, however, even if the mathematical comparison is analyzed, the evidence\r\n  confirms McCall suffered no loss of earnings or earning capacity.Â  Finding the\r\n  main difference between the partiesâ€™ calculations to arise from the use of the\r\n  starting salary in the forestry field, the court recognized Dr. Alford failed\r\n  to consider McCallâ€™s educational or employment background in the forestry\r\n  field.\r\nAs to the loss of earnings McCall sought from January 2002 through\r\n  2005, the court found McCall could have returned to the workforce after CESC\r\n  cancelled the program instead of waiting seven months to obtain employment.Â \r\n  Additionally, McCall could have continued with his job as an arborist making in\r\n  excess of $35,000 a year, but voluntarily quit that job and, thereafter, did\r\n  not work for approximately one year before taking the North Carolina forestry\r\n  job.Â  Accordingly, the trial court determined McCall was, â€œfor the most part,\r\n  voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.â€Â  The court further found McCallâ€™s\r\n  claim for lost wages of $12,157 between January 2002 and July 2002 was the\r\n  result of McCallâ€™s own decision to not be employed during that time period.Â \r\n  The circuit court also noted, although McCall sought $1,012.70 in interest he\r\n  allegedly paid his mother on a $12,500 note he signed for a loan on the\r\n  tuition, McCall ultimately admitted that he did not, in fact, pay any interest\r\n  on the note.Â  Finally, the trial court found McCallâ€™s testimony regarding his\r\n  reasons for failure to use the offered refund or settlement money to enroll in\r\n  computer classes to lack credibility.Â  The court thus determined McCall failed\r\n  to mitigate any alleged damages by refusing to take available funds and pursue\r\n  a career path in computers, and IKON should not be held responsible for any\r\n  alleged economic loss due to McCallâ€™s decisions.\r\nThe court concluded McCallâ€™s claim for loss of future earnings and\r\n  earning capacity were based wholly on speculation or conjecture and McCall\r\n  failed to establish his claim for the same with reasonable certainty.Â  It\r\n  further held McCall failed to mitigate any such alleged damages resulting from\r\n  the breach.Â  However, the court determined McCall was entitled to damages for\r\n  the tuition paid along with a reasonable amount for lost wages, resulting in a\r\n  total sum of $24,379.33.Â  The circuit court held, in light of the settlement\r\n  money McCall received from CESC, IKON was entitled to a credit in the amount of\r\n  $25,000, and the judgment was therefore to be marked satisfied.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â \r\n  Did the trial court improperly calculate McCallâ€™s damages?\r\n2.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court err in its admission and interpretation of the January 24, 2002 e-mail\r\n  sent to McCall?\r\n3.Â  Were the\r\n  damages of McCall â€œproperly mitigated?â€\r\n4.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court err in requesting additional evidence of an asset purchase agreement\r\n  between IKON and CESC after the conclusion of the damages hearing?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.Â  Eldeco,\r\n    Inc. v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 372 S.C. 470, 476, 642 S.E.2d 726,\r\n  729 (2007).Â  On appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the findings\r\n  of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976).Â  â€œStated another way,Â  the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or unless it\r\n  clearly appears the findings were influenced or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court St., LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 127,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2006).Â  In such a case, the trial courtâ€™s findings are\r\n  equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action. Â Id.Â  Further, questions\r\n  concerning credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence are exclusively\r\n  for the trial court. Â Ward v. West Oil Co., 379 S.C. 225, 238, 665\r\n  S.E.2d 618, 625 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Calculation of Damages\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, McCall first contends the circuit court improperly calculated his\r\n  damages.Â  He maintains he is entitled to damages of $12,500 for the tuition,\r\n  $5,397.80 in prejudgment interest on the tuition, $12,157 in lost wages from\r\n  January 4, 2002 through July 13, 2002, and a wage differential through at least\r\n  June 1, 2004 of $32,164 for a total minimum in damages of $62,218.80.Â  McCall\r\n  also argues the court erroneously refused to consider the testimony of Dr.\r\n  Alford based on the fact Dr. Alford was not a vocational expert, asserting Dr.\r\n  Alford never addressed any vocational issues.Â  McCall further asserts IKONâ€™s\r\n  witness used â€œthe wrong category of earningsâ€ by assuming McCallâ€™s salary in\r\n  forestry would be $52,000 when his actual salary in that field was only $34,000.\r\nWe\r\n  find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s findings regarding Dr. Alford and its\r\n  determination that McCall suffered no loss of earning capacity.Â  There is more\r\n  than sufficient evidence of record to support the courtâ€™s findings that\r\n  McCallâ€™s best vocational path was in the forestry field. The record further\r\n  supports the courtâ€™s determination that, even in performing a mathematical\r\n  comparison between the forestry and computer fields, McCall still suffered no\r\n  loss.Â  The court did not, as McCall argues, refuse to consider the testimony of\r\n  Dr. Alford.Â  Rather, the court considered his testimony, but concluded it did\r\n  not provide persuasive evidence of McCallâ€™s loss of earning capacity and found\r\n  that IKONâ€™s witnesses were more reliable, credible and persuasive.Â  As noted,\r\n  in an action at law sitting without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s findings are\r\n  equivalent to that of a jury, and questions concerning credibility and the\r\n  weight to be afforded evidence lie with the trial court.Â Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  McCall does not argue on appeal that the circuit courtâ€™s award of damages is\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  Nor does McCall assert the trial court made a\r\n  mathematical error in computation of the damages.[5]Â \r\n  As to the specific figures to which McCall asserts he is entitled, he provides\r\n  this court with no support for them in the record.Â  In short, McCall summarily\r\n  asserts he is entitled to these amounts without showing why the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  calculation of damages was erroneous or how McCallâ€™s figures are supported by\r\n  the evidence. Â See Weaver v. Recreation Dist., 328 S.C. 83, 88,\r\n  492 S.E.2d 79, 82 (1997); Ehlke v. Nemec Constr. Co., 298 S.C. 477, 481,\r\n  381 S.E.2d 508, 510 (Ct. App. 1989) (noting an appealed order comes to the appellate\r\n  court with a presumption of correctness and the burden is on appellant to\r\n  demonstrate reversible error); See also Harris v. Campbell,\r\n  293 S.C. 85, 87, 358 S.E.2d 719, 720 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting our court is â€œobliged\r\n  to reverse when error is called to our attention, but we are not in the\r\n  business of figuring out on our own whether error existsâ€).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find McCall has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating reversible error.\r\nB.Â \r\n  Error in Admission and Interpretation of E-mail\r\nMcCall\r\n  next contends the circuit court erred in admitting into evidence the e-mail\r\n  sent by Clint Babcock to McCall on January 24, 2002 because McCall was seeking\r\n  damages from IKON and the e-mail involved negotiations between him and CESC,\r\n  not him and IKON.Â  He further contends the court erred in interpreting the\r\n  e-mail as an offer when it was only an invitation to negotiate.Â  Finally,\r\n  McCall claims there was no showing that the e-mail contained a â€œfair and\r\n  equitableâ€ proposal, especially in light of the circuit courtâ€™s subsequent\r\n  award of over twice that amount.Â  We find no error.\r\nAt\r\n  the damages hearing, McCall objected to the admission of the e-mail because\r\n  â€œthis offer was not from IKON . . . [but] was from another party altogether.â€Â \r\n  When asked whether the basis of his objection was relevance, McCallâ€™s attorney\r\n  stated it was, and that he was â€œobjecting to this as being relevant.â€Â  Counsel\r\n  for IKON countered that Babcock worked for IKON at the time and that the e-mail\r\n  denotes â€œcesc/IKON Education.â€Â  IKON further argued the document was relevant\r\n  as to the issue of McCallâ€™s failure to mitigate his damages.\r\nThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial judge, whose decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 567,\r\n  658 S.E.2d 80, 92 (2008).Â  Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible.Â \r\n  Rule 402, SCRE.Â  Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the\r\n  existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\r\n  more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.Â  Rule\r\n  401, SCRE. Â Â \r\nHere,\r\n  McCallâ€™s sole objection raised to admission of the e-mail at the damages\r\n  hearing was that it was not relevant because it was an â€œofferâ€ from another\r\n  party and not from IKON.Â  Thus, this is the only argument on this issue\r\n  preserved for review.Â  SeeÂ  Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639,\r\n  653-54, 602 S.E.2d 760, 767 (2004) (holding to preserve an issue for appellate\r\n  review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court, and a\r\n  party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on\r\n  appeal). Â McCall admitted at\r\n  the hearing that he was aware of two or three other courses available in the\r\n  area in January 2002 that were sufficient for him to obtain the certification\r\n  he sought and were less expensive, yet he did not enroll in any of the other\r\n  available computer classes, claiming a lack of funds created by the actions of\r\n  IKON.Â  Whether it came from IKON or from the entity that acquired IKON, the\r\n  e-mail offer of a refund only twenty-two days after CESC ceased providing\r\n  classes in the Greenville area is clearly relevant to whether McCall suffered\r\n  from a lack of funds that prohibited him from enrollment in the comparable\r\n  computer classes and whether McCall attempted to mitigate his alleged damages.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nC.Â  Mitigation of Damages\r\nMcCall next argues there is evidence he mitigated his damages.Â  He\r\n  asserts that he quickly sought employment after the computer classes were\r\n  cancelled, obtaining a job at Schneider after a short period of time, and\r\n  further sought to mitigate his damages by entering the Ph.D. program, but these\r\n  efforts failed because Clemson University was unable to fund the program.Â \r\n  McCall argues the circuit courtâ€™s finding that he should have used the\r\n  settlement proceeds to enroll into another local computer program amounted to\r\n  speculation and there was no evidence of any local computer programs which\r\n  would enable him to obtain Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer certification.Â \r\n  He maintains â€œ[t]here is ample evidence that [he] acted reasonably in regard to\r\n  his decision to use his forestry education once he had been deprived of his\r\n  opportunity to pursue a certified Microsoft Systems Engineer career.â€\r\nThe bulk of the damages sought by McCall center around his claim\r\n  of loss of earning capacity based on the failure of IKON to provide the agreed\r\n  to computer training and McCallâ€™s lack of available funds to continue down a\r\n  computer career path.Â  The circuit court found McCallâ€™s explanation for his\r\n  failure to accept the refund offer in January 2002, because he â€œnever saw a\r\n  check,â€ to lack credibility.Â  The court further found McCallâ€™s testimony that\r\n  it would have been irresponsible for him to quit his job with Schneider to go\r\n  back to school after receiving the CESC settlement money because he had a son\r\n  to care for at that time was also not credible in light of the fact that McCall\r\n  ultimately quit this job to go back to school for his Ph.D. less than two\r\n  months after his son was born.Â  The court determined McCall had funds available\r\n  to pursue his education in computers, but elected not to do so.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the court held McCall failed to mitigate his damages. \r\nThere is evidence of record that in January 2002, McCall was\r\n  offered a refund of the tuition and, though he was aware of two or three other\r\n  less expensive courses available in the area that were sufficient for him to\r\n  obtain the certification he sought, he failed to enroll in any of these other\r\n  available computer classes.Â  Further, there is evidence that McCall received a\r\n  settlement of twice the tuition amount from CESC in May 2003, and therefore had\r\n  funds available with which he could have enrolled in computer classes at that\r\n  time.Â  As noted, questions of credibility and the weight to be accorded\r\n  evidence are exclusively with the trial court.Â  There is more than sufficient\r\n  evidence of record that reasonably\r\n  supports the circuit courtâ€™s findings in this regard.\r\nMcCall\r\n  further asserts the trial court improperly used the settlement proceeds twice\r\n  because it used the proceeds â€œas a mitigating factor to reduce [McCallâ€™s]\r\n  damagesâ€ and then used the settlement proceeds â€œas a direct set-off.â€Â  He\r\n  asserts the proceeds could be used as a mitigating factor or an off-set, but\r\n  not both.Â  We do not follow McCallâ€™s logic.Â  McCall cites no law or rule that\r\n  prohibits the circuit court from considering receipt of the settlement money as\r\n  a factor in determining mitigation and as a set-off against his total damages.Â \r\n  Further, the court did not use the settlement proceeds to reduce McCallâ€™s damages.Â  Rather, the court simply considered McCallâ€™s failure to use\r\n  the available settlement proceeds as one of the factors in determining whether\r\n  he mitigated his alleged damages.Â  Thereafter, the court found McCall suffered\r\n  total damages of $24,379.33 and concluded IKON was entitled to a credit of the\r\n  $25,000 paid by CESC against its judgment pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann.\r\n  Section 32-9-10 et seq., a determination that, in and of itself, McCall\r\n  does not challenge. Â There is simply no logical reason the court could not both\r\n  consider the availability of these funds, paid by IKONâ€™s successor entity, in\r\n  determining the ultimate damages to which McCall was entitled and award IKON a\r\n  credit for the settlement funds paid toward those damages.\r\nD.Â \r\n  Evidence of an Asset Purchase Agreement\r\nFinally,\r\n  McCall argues the circuit court erred in asking for the additional evidence of\r\n  a copy of the asset purchase agreement between IKON and CESC following the\r\n  conclusion of the damages hearing.Â  He argues there was no testimony presented\r\n  concerning the document, he was not afforded an opportunity to address this\r\n  document, and no issue concerning this document was raised before the court.\r\nThere\r\n  is no asset purchase agreement document in the record before this court.Â \r\n  Further, there is nothing in the record to show the circuit court asked for\r\n  such a document, nor any indication McCall objected to the document as he\r\n  claims.Â  Neither is there any evidence the circuit court considered such a document\r\n  in its ruling.Â  In short, the record is devoid of any evidence whatsoever\r\n  concerning the document of which McCall complains.Â  As the appellant, McCall bears\r\n  the burden of providing this court with a record sufficient to allow appellate\r\n  review.Â  See Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000) (noting the appellant has the burden of presenting an\r\n  adequate record on appeal); see also Rule 210(h), SCACR (â€œExcept\r\n  as provided by Rule 212 and Rule 208(b)(1)(C) and (2), the appellate court will\r\n  not consider any fact which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.â€).Â  Because\r\n  McCall did not provide this court with an adequate record to consider this\r\n  argument, we affirm the trial court on this issue as well.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s order finding McCall entitled to\r\n  damages of $24,379.33 on his breach of contract action against IKON is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Curiously, while the parties and the circuit\r\n  court refer to this document as an offer to refund $10,416.66, a reading of the\r\n  attachment in the record indicates, although CESC believed it was only required\r\n  to refund McCall the pro-rata amount of $10,416.66, CESC would provide him â€œa\r\n  full refund of ($12,500) as an exception to [their] established policy.â€\r\n[2] There is also evidence of record which suggests\r\n  McCallâ€™s actual earnings for the year 2004 were only $4,964, and were thus less\r\n  than the $7,500 he claimed to have made that year as a graduate assistant.\r\n[3] McCall testified he used this money to pay his mother\r\n  the $12,500 he borrowed for the tuition and the rest was used to pay off two\r\n  car loans.Â  McCall admitted he did not pay interest on the loan from his\r\n  mother.\r\n[4] IKON\r\n  questioned Dr. Alfordâ€™s qualification and his testimony regarding McCallâ€™s loss\r\n  of earning capacity based upon the fact Dr. Alford was not a vocational expert,\r\n  but the circuit court qualified Dr. Alford as requested and allowed the\r\n  evidence, finding it was an issue which could be explored on cross-examination.\r\n[5]Additionally, even if McCall contends the trial court\r\n  made a mathematical computation error, it was incumbent upon McCall to raise\r\n  the issue by way of a Rule 59 or 60, SCRCP motion to preserve the matter on\r\n  appeal.Â  See Revis v. Barrett, 321 S.C. 206, 210, 467 S.E.2d 460,\r\n  463 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding issue was not preserved on appeal where appellants\r\n  never filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment to clarify the order\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, nor seek clarification pursuant to Rule 60(a), SCRCP\r\n  and, issue was therefore not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4467","title":"Pee Dee Stores v.

Huggins, d/b/a Huggins Farm Service (Huggins), seeks review of an order granting Pee Dee\r\n  Stores, Inc.â€™s (Pee Dee Stores) summary judgment motion and motion to compel settlement\r\n  based on a Settlement Agreement.Â  Huggins asserts that the Settlement Agreement\r\n  was intended to resolve only the landlord/tenant claims and that his civil\r\n  conspiracy and unfair trade practices claims against both Pee Dee Stores and Third-Party\r\n  Defendant Helena Chemical Company (Helena) survived the Settlement Agreement.Â  As\r\n  such, Huggins alleges that summary judgment was improper because a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact exists as to whether the parties to the Settlement\r\n  Agreement intended to extinguish Hugginsâ€™ claims against Pee Dee Stores and\r\n  Helena.Â  We reverse. Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPee Dee Stores and Paul E. Doyle, deceased husband\r\n  of Defendant Carolyn Doyle,[1] d/b/a Pee Dee Farms Company (Doyle), entered into a five-year commercial lease agreement\r\n  that commenced on March 1, 2000 and was to terminate on February 28, 2005.Â  Doyle\r\n  used the leased premises to operate a convenience store, gas station, and farm\r\n  supply retail store.Â  The lease agreement afforded Doyle an option to renew the\r\n  lease by providing written notice to Pee Dee Stores by December 1, 2004.Â  During\r\n  the lease term, and pursuant to an agreement with Doyle in late 2003, Huggins\r\n  began selling farm supplies out of the leased premises in his capacity as a\r\n  commissioned agent for Helena.[2] \r\n\r\nPrior to the termination of the lease, Pee Dee\r\n  Stores represented to Doyle that the lease term would be extended to allow\r\n  Doyle until December 1, 2005 to consider the option to renew.Â  In addition, Helena represented to Huggins that it intended to purchase Hugginsâ€™ farm supply business\r\n  with all of the attached goodwill.Â  At that time, Huggins, Doyle, and Helena\r\n  began negotiations.Â  Subsequently, and prior to the December 1, 2005 deadline,\r\n  Doyle notified Pee Dee Stores in writing of her intention to exercise the option\r\n  to renew the lease.Â  Pee Dee Stores informed Doyle that she could not exercise\r\n  the option to renew and asked her to vacate the store.Â  \r\nPee Dee Stores filed an ejectment action against\r\n  Doyle in magistrate court, asserting a violation of the lease as well as its expiration\r\n  as grounds for ejectment.[3]Â \r\n  Doyle answered the complaint by denying the material allegations and sought a\r\n  declaratory judgment that she was the legal tenant under the lease and had\r\n  properly exercised the option to renew.Â  In addition, Pee Dee Stores later\r\n  filed a separate action for breach of contract against Doyle and Huggins.Â  The\r\n  complaint also alleged interference with contractual relations and fraud, among\r\n  other claims.Â  \r\nIn response to both the ejectment and breach of\r\n  contract actions, Doyle and Huggins counterclaimed against Pee Dee Stores seeking\r\n  monetary damages for issues related to the landlord/tenant relationship.Â \r\n  Further, the parties asserted in a Third-Party Complaint against Helena causes of action for negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practices, civil\r\n  conspiracy, promissory estoppel, interference with a contract, and interference\r\n  with a prospective contract.Â  These causes of action were based upon an alleged\r\n  conspiracy between Helena and Pee Dee Stores to oust Doyle and Huggins from the\r\n  property in order to enable Helena to rent the leased premises and take over both\r\n  partiesâ€™ business goodwill without compensation. Â \r\nSubsequently, Doyle and Huggins brought a motion\r\n  to consolidate the ejectment and breach of contract actions.Â  The trial court\r\n  denied the motion to consolidate, ordering the parties to resolve the issues\r\n  related to the ejectment action first, after which discovery and trial of the\r\n  remaining issues would occur.Â  \r\nWhile both actions were pending, Pee Dee Stores,\r\n  Doyle, and Huggins entered into a Settlement Agreement, which was subtitled as â€œRelating\r\n  Only to All Landlord/Tenant Issues.â€Â  The record does not indicate which party\r\n  drafted the Settlement Agreement.Â  All three parties signed the Settlement\r\n  Agreement.Â  The pertinent provisions of the Settlement Agreement are as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t7.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe parties shall forever release each other from all claims \r\n\t\t\tand/or issues, whenever arising, with each agreeing they will never \r\n\t\t\tsue or involve each other in any litigation involving the premises, \r\n\t\t\tthe store, any business on the premises, and/or the relationship \r\n\t\t\tbetween the Parties, as follows: (1) the Parties agree this is a full\r\n    and complete release of all claims known and unknown, between Pee Dee\r\n      Stores, Inc. and Carolyn Doyle, d/b/a Pee Dee Farms Company; and (2) the Parties agree this is a full and complete release of all landlord/tenant\r\n        claims and issues, known or unknown, between the Parties. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t8. \r\n\t\t\t Nothing in this\r\n  agreement shall be construed as in any way effecting [sic] the rights of Billy\r\n  W. Huggins and/or Huggins Farm Service, Inc. to assert claims against Helena\r\n  Chemical Company.Â  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as in\r\n    any way effecting [sic] the rights of Billy W. Huggins and/or Huggins Farm\r\n    Service, Inc. to assert claims against Pee Dee Stores, Inc. for claims other\r\n    than the landlord/tenant claims.Â  Nothing herein shall be construed as a\r\n      relinquishment, waiver, discharge or release of any claims by Billy W.\r\n  Huggins and/or Huggins Farm Services, Inc. against Pee Dee Stores, Inc., for\r\n    any claims other than the landlord/tenant claims. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t. .\r\n  . Â \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t10. \r\n\t\t\tPee Dee Stores, Inc. and Carolyn Doyle d/b/a Pee Dee \r\n\t\t\tFarms Company agree to dismiss all claims against each other, with \r\n\t\t\tprejudice, and Pee Dee Stores, Inc. and Billy W. Huggins, \r\n\t\t\tindividually and Huggins Farm Service, Inc., agree to dismiss only the landlord/tenant claims with prejudice.Â Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nPee Dee Stores later moved to\r\n  enforce the Settlement Agreement. Subsequently, Doyle and Huggins moved to\r\n  amend their pleadings to remove all of the landlord/tenant claims against Pee\r\n  Dee Stores that were resolved by the Settlement Agreement, including the declaratory\r\n  judgment, breach of lease, and negligent misrepresentation claims.Â  Huggins proposed\r\n  to leave intact the civil conspiracy and unfair trade practices claims against Pee\r\n  Dee Stores and Helena.Â  Pee Dee Stores also moved to amend its pleadings to\r\n  reflect the Settlement Agreement and moved for summary judgment.\r\nAt the hearing on the various\r\n  motions, counsel for Pee Dee Stores, Doyle, and Huggins acknowledged that\r\n  settlement was reached regarding the ejectment action and that the terms were\r\n  set forth in the Settlement Agreement.Â  The trial court granted Pee Dee Storesâ€™\r\n  motion to compel settlement and summary judgment motion, finding the pleadings indicated\r\n  that all allegations involved landlord/tenant claims and issues â€œinvolving the\r\n  premises, the store, any business on the premises, and/or the relationship\r\n  between the Parties[,]â€ and as such were resolved by the Settlement Agreement.Â \r\n  Huggins now appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  this Court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP, which provides that summary judgment is appropriate only when\r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v.\r\n    Gibson Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005) (when\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies\r\n  the same standard of review as the trial court).Â  Summary judgment should be granted when plain,\r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  However, summary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into\r\n  the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of law.Â  Tupper\r\n    v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  \r\nIn determining whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the evidence and all inferences must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n  364 S.C. 222, 227, 612 S.E.2d 719, 722 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Thus, the appellate\r\n  court reviews all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from\r\n  the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Willis v.\r\n    Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).Â  If evidentiary facts are not disputed, but the\r\n  conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them are, summary judgment should be\r\n  denied.Â  Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171\r\n  (1991).Â  Further, â€œ[t]he purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition\r\n  of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v.\r\n    Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001) (internal citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nSummary judgment is improper when there is an issue as\r\n  to the construction of a written contract and the contract is ambiguous because\r\n  the intent of the parties cannot be gathered from the four corners of the\r\n  instrument.Â  Gilliland v. Elmwood Prop., 301 S.C. 295, 299, 391 S.E.2d\r\n  577, 579 (1990) (internal citations omitted);Â  HK New Plan Exch. Prop. Owner\r\n    I, LLC v. Coker, 375 S.C. 18, 23, 649 S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct.

Rabon, 266 S.C. 68, 73, 221\r\n  S.E.2d 767, 769 (1976).Â  Construction of an ambiguous contract is a question of\r\n  fact to be decided by the trier of fact.Â  Soil Remediation Co. v.

App. 2005). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHuggins asserts the trial court erred in granting Pee\r\n  Dee Storesâ€™ summary judgment motion and motion to compel settlement because a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact exists as to whether the parties to the Settlement\r\n  Agreement intended to dismiss Hugginsâ€™ unfair trade practices and civil\r\n  conspiracy claims against Helena and Pee Dee Stores.Â  We agree. \r\nA.&nbsp; Settlement Agreement Viewed as a Contract\r\nIn South Carolina jurisprudence, settlement agreements are\r\n  viewed as contracts.Â  Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C.\r\n  171, 177, 557 S.E.2d 708, 711 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001) (enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement is a\r\n  matter of contract law); Ecclesiastes Prod. Ministries v. Outparcel Assoc.,\r\n    LLC, 374 S.C. 483, 497, 649 S.E.2d 494, 501 (Ct. App. 2007) (a release\r\n  agreement is a contract and contract principles of law should be used to determine\r\n  what the parties intended); Mattox v. Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, 61, 344\r\n  S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1986) (applying the general rules of contract\r\n  construction to a settlement agreement).Â  \r\nGeneral contract principles are applied in the construction\r\n  of a settlement agreement because, as stated above, a settlement agreement is a\r\n  contract.Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate if a contract is ambiguous.Â \r\n  Thus, the initial determination for a court seeking to ascertain whether a\r\n  grant of summary judgment based on a settlement agreementâ€™s interpretation is\r\n  proper is whether the agreement is ambiguous.Â  See Soil Remediation\r\n    Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc., 325 S.C. at 234, 482 S.E.2d at 555. \r\nB.&nbsp; Ambiguity in a Contract\r\nWhether the language of a contract is ambiguous is a question\r\n  of law for the court.Â  Auten v. Snipes, 370 S.C. 664, 669, 636 S.E.2d\r\n  644, 646 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  A contract is ambiguous when the terms of the\r\n  contract are reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.Â  South Carolina Dept. of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617,\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001); Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 76,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 446, 452 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The uncertainty in interpretation can\r\n  arise from the words of the instrument, or in the application of the words to\r\n  the object they describe.Â  Hann v. Carolina Cas. Inc. Co., 252 S.C. 518,\r\n  524, 167 S.E.2d 420, 422 (1969).Â  Whether a contract is ambiguous must be\r\n  determined from the entire contract and not from any isolated clause of the\r\n  agreement.Â  Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431,\r\n  433 (1975). Â \r\n\r\nIn the matter presently before the Court, an ambiguity\r\n  exists in the Settlement Agreement regarding the definition and scope of\r\n  â€œlandlord/tenant claims.â€ The term â€œlandlord/tenant claimsâ€ is reasonably\r\n  susceptible to more than one interpretation, and therefore, summary judgment was\r\n  inappropriate. Â \r\nThe trial court based its summary judgment ruling on\r\n  the conclusion that all allegations in both the ejectment and breach of\r\n  contract actions involved landlord/tenant claims, and issues â€œinvolving the\r\n  premises, the store, any business on the premises, and/or the relationship\r\n  between the Parties[,]â€ and as such were resolved by the Settlement Agreement.Â \r\n  This constituted error because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\r\n  the meaning and scope of â€œlandlord/tenant claims,â€ and the partiesâ€™ intentions\r\n  as to which claims survived the Settlement Agreement differed, thus precluding\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Pee Dee Stores. \r\nThe language of the Settlement Agreement is clear that\r\n  all landlord/tenant claims were to be resolved by the Settlement Agreement.Â  In\r\n  fact, the title of the Agreement itself evinces the intent to resolve only all\r\n  landlord/tenant issues.Â  It reads in relevant part: â€œRelating Only to All\r\n  Landlord/Tenant Issues.â€ Paragraphs 7 and 10 of the Settlement Agreement state\r\n  that the parties agree to dismiss with prejudice all litigation involving the\r\n  premises, store, any business on the premises, and/or the relationship between\r\n  the parties, including all claims between Pee Dee Stores and Doyle, and all landlord/tenant\r\n  issues between all parties.Â  These provisions clearly resolved the claims\r\n  between Doyle and Huggins and Pee Dee Stores in the ejectment action, as well\r\n  as all of the claims against Doyle and counterclaims by Doyle in the breach of\r\n  contract case.Â  This was the basis for Doyle and Hugginsâ€™ motion to amend their\r\n  pleadings.Â  \r\nHowever, the language of the Settlement Agreement does\r\n  not provide a definition of â€œlandlord/tenant claims.â€ This phrase is not a\r\n  legal term of art; rather, it is shorthand for the partiesâ€™ conceptualization\r\n  of the claims that should be labeled as â€œlandlord-tenant.â€Â  Therefore, the Settlement\r\n  Agreement is ambiguous as to the scope and application of â€œlandlord/tenant\r\n  claims.â€ Â It is unclear whether the parties intended that the Settlement Agreement\r\n  resolve Hugginsâ€™ civil conspiracy and unfair trade practices claims against Pee\r\n  Dee Stores and Helena because it is uncertain whether â€œlandlord/tenant claimsâ€\r\n  includes civil conspiracy and unfair trade practices claims.Â  Reasonable minds\r\n  can certainly differ as to the meaning of â€œlandlord/tenant claims.â€Â  \r\nThe language of the Settlement Agreement does not\r\n  support the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that all of Hugginsâ€™ claims were\r\n  extinguished.Â  That construction is implausible, particularly because it would nullify\r\n  Paragraph 8 of the Settlement Agreement, which clearly sought to exclude some\r\n  of Hugginsâ€™ claims from the ambit of the Settlement Agreement.Â  The language of\r\n  Paragraph 8 unequivocally states that the parties agreed that Huggins never\r\n  intended to relinquish all of his claims against Pee Dee Stores and Helena and,\r\n  in fact, clearly excludes Hugginsâ€™ non-landlord/tenant claims from\r\n  resolution by the Settlement Agreement.Â  It is highly unlikely that the\r\n  language of Paragraph 8 was included in the Agreement but yet meant to have no\r\n  effect.Â  The parties must have intended that non-landlord/tenant claims survive\r\n  the Settlement Agreement.Â  Had it been the partiesâ€™ intention to extinguish all\r\n  claims by Huggins, the Settlement Agreement could have simply done so, instead\r\n  of expressly carving out specific exceptions in Paragraphs 7, 8, and 10 to\r\n  exclude Hugginsâ€™ non-landlord/tenant claims.Â  The language of the\r\n  Settlement Agreement does not indicate that it was the partiesâ€™ intention to\r\n  resolve all claims. \r\nFurther, Pee Dee Storesâ€™ various statements concerning\r\n  its own interpretation of the Settlement Agreement are inconsistent and improbable,\r\n  again demonstrating that there was a genuine issue of material fact that\r\n  rendered summary judgment improper.Â  Pee Dee Stores contends that the â€œand/or []\r\n  relationship between the partiesâ€ language of Paragraph 7 was intended to be broadly\r\n  interpreted to waive all claims relating to the relationship between the\r\n  parties, including the civil conspiracy and unfair trade practices claims.Â  Yet,\r\n  elsewhere in its brief Pee Dee Stores states:\r\n\r\n\t[Huggins and Doyle] also allege the Settlement\r\n  Agreement is ambiguous because Huggins only agreed to dismiss with prejudice\r\n  the landlord/tenant claims and issues, and thus reserved the right to sue [Pee\r\n  Dee Stores] for other things. That is partially correct â€” the Settlement\r\n  Agreement certainly does not apply, for example, to any open accounts [Pee Dee\r\n  Stores] may have with Appellant Huggins, etc. However, Huggins clearly and\r\n  unambiguously resolved with prejudice all landlord/tenant claims and issues,\r\n  defined in the Settlement Agreement as â€œany litigation involving the premises,\r\n  the store, any business on the premises, and/or the relationship between the\r\n  Parties. Â \r\n\r\nContrary to its assertion above, Pee Dee Storesâ€™ broad interpretation\r\n  of the Settlement Agreement would also preclude Huggins from litigating any\r\n  open accounts with Pee Dee Stores, as these open accounts would certainly\r\n  pertain to the relationship between the parties.Â  Moreover, Pee Dee Stores\r\n  moved to amend its pleadings to reflect the Settlement Agreement, which is\r\n  inconsistent with its contention that the Settlement Agreement dismissed all\r\n  claims. \r\nIn view of the fact that an ambiguity exists in the\r\n  Settlement Agreement regarding the scope and definition of â€œlandlord/tenant\r\n  claims,â€ this Court would have to strain to determine the partiesâ€™ intention,\r\n  and it is not at liberty to do so.Â  See Blakely 266 S.C. at 73,\r\n  221 S.E.2d at 769.Â  Thus, the partiesâ€™ intention is a question of fact to be\r\n  ascertained by the trier of fact.Â  To ascertain the partiesâ€™ intent, the trier\r\n  of fact must look at the language of the Settlement Agreement, the\r\n  circumstances known to the parties at the time, and all other pertinent\r\n  extrinsic evidence. \r\nThe trial court committed reversible error in granting\r\n  Pee Dee Storesâ€™ summary judgment motion and motion to compel settlement. Â The\r\n  definition of â€œlandlord/tenant claimsâ€ is susceptible to more than one\r\n  interpretation, and therefore, the contract is ambiguous.Â  Because of the\r\n  ambiguous nature of the contract, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to\r\n  whether it was the intent of the parties to extinguish Hugginsâ€™ claims for\r\n  civil conspiracy and unfair trade practices.[4] Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.

Ewing, of Charleston, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tCurtis W.\r\n  Dowling, R. Jeffords Barham, J. Todd Kincannon, of Columbia, for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.: This consolidated appeal arises\r\n  from two suits filed by the nonprofit corporation, Southeastern Housing\r\n  Foundation (the Foundation).Â  In the first action, the Foundation sued its former\r\n  attorney, John Michael â€œPatâ€ Smith (Smith), Smithâ€™s wife, its former developer,\r\n  Stephen Nettles (Nettles), and Nettlesâ€™ wife for civil conspiracy, negligence,\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, and misappropriation of assets in\r\n  connection with several affordable housing financing transactions.Â  In the\r\n  second action, the Foundation sued Smith and the Calhoun Insurance Agency, of\r\n  which Smith is the registered agent and a shareholder, for the recovery of real\r\n  estate and improvements on property leased to the Foundation.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Foundation appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Smiths\r\n  and the Calhoun Insurance Agency.Â  The Foundation argues that the trial court\r\n  erred in finding the Foundationâ€™s newly appointed board of directors (New\r\n  Board) was not properly installed such that the New Board was unauthorized to\r\n  file suit on behalf of the Foundation.[1]Â  Smith also appeals on\r\n  several grounds claiming the trial court improperly vacated its order of\r\n  summary judgment when it granted the Foundationâ€™s motion for relief from judgment\r\n  under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Smith mainly contends the Foundation manufactured a post\r\n  hoc resolution permitting court-appointed custodians to file suit on behalf of\r\n  the Foundation only after summary judgment was granted, which precluded the\r\n  resolution from being deemed â€œnewly discovered evidenceâ€ as required to grant\r\n  relief under Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  We agree that the trial court properly\r\n  granted the Foundationâ€™s 60(b) motion, and as such, we decline to address the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s arguments for reversing the grant of summary judgment, save the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s argument regarding the legal malpractice claim.[2] Â \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORYÂ Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nA\r\n  discussion of the underlying facts and relationships between the parties is\r\n  necessary for an understanding of this appealâ€™s extensive and complex history.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Foundation was created in 1976 as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to state and\r\n  federal law.[3]Â  As stated in its\r\n  articles of incorporation, its purpose is â€œto provide, on a nonprofit basis,\r\n  housing for lower income families, where no adequate housing exists . . . .â€Â \r\n  Consistent with this purpose, the Foundation is â€œauthorized to engage in or\r\n  assist in the development or operation of low-income housing . . . .â€ 24 C.F.R.\r\n  Â§ 811.102 (2008). \r\nThe\r\n  Foundationâ€™s housing operations are largely intertwined with the South Carolina\r\n  Regional Housing Authority No. 3 (Housing Authority).Â  The Housing Authority is\r\n  a creature of state law with the â€œpower to acquire property, to remove\r\n  unsanitary or substandard conditions, to construct and operate housing\r\n  accommodations and to borrow, expend, lend and repay moneys for [these]\r\n  purposes . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 31-3-30, 31-3-910 (Supp. 2007).Â  As a\r\n  quasi-governmental/state entity, the Housing Authority essentially serves as a\r\n  paid management company for the Foundationâ€™s affordable housing properties.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 31-3-20(10), 31-3-450, 31-3-530 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nFederal\r\n  regulations governing subsidized housing allow an applicant, such as the\r\n  Foundation, to participate in programs under Section 11(b) of the United States\r\n  Housing Act of 1937.[4]Â  The United States\r\n  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allows an applicant to\r\n  qualify for participation in programs under Section 11(b) if the applicant\r\n  identifies its â€œparent entityâ€ public housing authority and proves that it is a\r\n  nonprofit entity that serves as an authorized agency or instrumentality of the\r\n  parent entity.Â  See 24 C.F.R. Â§ 811.105 (2008).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  stated in its bylaws, all of the Foundationâ€™s corporate powers were to be\r\n  exercised by its board of directors, â€œexcept as otherwise provided by [HUD] and\r\n  the Federal Housing Administration.â€Â  Further, the Foundation was empowered to\r\n  enter into â€œa Regulatory Agreement with the Secretary of [HUD] . . . to enable\r\n  the [Foundation] to secure the benefits of financing with the assistance of\r\n  mortgage insurance under the provisions of the National Housing Act.â€Â  To\r\n  comply with HUDâ€™s federal regulations, the Foundation amended its bylaws in\r\n  1978 to include a provision that one of its purposes was to â€œotherwise assist\r\n  and be utilized as a â€˜public housing agencyâ€™ approved by [HUD] . . . [and] by\r\n  the South Carolina Regional Housing Authority No. 3.â€Â  The Foundation also\r\n  stated in this amendment that upon dissolution, its property would vest in the\r\n  Housing Authority.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  these amendments to its bylaws, the Foundation did not actively operate for\r\n  almost twenty years.Â  In the mid-1990s, Smith, who served as the part-time\r\n  Executive Director of the Housing Authority, and Nettles, who served as the\r\n  Director of Management of the Housing Authority, learned of a program\r\n  administered by HUD.[5]Â  Under the program, the\r\n  Secretary of HUD is empowered to enter into contracts with state and local\r\n  public housing agencies and fund these agencies through annual contribution\r\n  contracts.Â  See 42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1437f(b) (2008).Â  In turn, the program encourages\r\n  public housing authorities to establish nonprofits.Â  Once established, a\r\n  nonprofit entity can own affordable housing, obtain grants for rehabilitation\r\n  of properties, and enter into management agreements with housing authorities.Â \r\n  The concept behind the program was that the Foundation would own the\r\n  properties, but the Housing Authority would manage the properties for a fee. \r\nPursuant\r\n  to this program, Nettles and Smith revitalized the Foundation and entered into\r\n  an agreement with the Housing Authority on July 1, 1996 regarding both entitiesâ€™\r\n  roles in the program.[6]Â  Under this agreement,\r\n  the Foundation agreed to accept the Housing Authority as its â€œParent Agencyâ€ in\r\n  order to assist the Foundation with management and financial support until the\r\n  Foundation became self-sufficient.Â  Consistent with the Foundationâ€™s agreement\r\n  to be managed by the Housing Authority, the General Certificate executed at the\r\n  first meeting of the revitalized Foundation set forth the board of directors.Â \r\n  It stated that three of the four directors were serving â€œAt [the] Will of [the\r\n  Housing] Authorityâ€ and that each was â€œduly qualified to act in the official\r\n  [designated] capacity.â€Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  entering into this agreement with the Housing Authority, the Foundation applied\r\n  for tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 501(c)(3).Â  In its application to the\r\n  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Foundation stated it would buy, rent, and\r\n  sell houses to low-income families â€œthrough and [with the] support [of the]\r\n  South Carolina Regional Housing Authority No. 3.â€Â  The Foundation also submitted\r\n  an opinion letter written by attorney Lee Bowers, which stated that the\r\n  Foundation was â€œan agency or instrumentality of the S.C. Regional Housing\r\n  Authority, No. 3, i.e., parent entity.â€Â  The Foundation further represented\r\n  that it would be controlled by and financially accountable to the Housing\r\n  Authority.Â  Based on these statements and other submissions, the IRS granted\r\n  the Foundationâ€™s application. \r\nThe\r\n  Foundation then began to purchase and finance affordable housing properties,\r\n  notably the â€œMarlboro Street Property,â€ which is the subject of the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s second action, in Barnwell, South Carolina.Â  In almost all of\r\n  these transactions, Smith, as the Foundationâ€™s attorney, and Nettles, as the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s developer, received fees for either legal or development work.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  February 2002, Smith and Nettles had a falling out, which led to mutual\r\n  accusations of improper conduct and ended with Nettles filing a grievance\r\n  against Smith with the Housing Authority.Â  Based on these allegations,\r\n  the Housing Authorityâ€™s board of commissioners (Board of Commissioners)\r\n  requested that HUD conduct an audit of the Foundation and directed the\r\n  Foundation to â€œ[i]mmediately dismissâ€ its current board of directors. Â In\r\n  March 2002, the Housing Authority appointed three of its own commissioners as\r\n  new board members for the Foundation and assumed control of the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  affairs.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 30, 2002, the Housing Authorityâ€™s legal counsel sent letters to the\r\n  remaining four former board members (Former Board) requesting their formal\r\n  resignations and execution of a unanimous consent resolution granting authority\r\n  to the Housing Authority to elect a new board.Â  In the letter, counsel stated\r\n  that if the Former Board did not consent, counsel would be required to advise the\r\n  Board of Commissioners of its legal options.Â  Two of the four members resigned,\r\n  and when the remaining two members refused, the Housing Authority filed a\r\n  derivative action against them.Â  In response, the remaining two board members\r\n  resigned, and the suit was dismissed with prejudice.[7]Â \r\n  The Housing Authority then filled the remaining vacancies on the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  board in June 2002.Â Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the time that the Housing Authority was attempting to obtain the Former Boardâ€™s\r\n  resignation, the Inspector General of HUD was performing an audit of the\r\n  Foundation.[8]Â  The report concluded\r\n  that Smith and Nettles â€œtook advantage of their positions . . . to financially\r\n  benefit themselves, their families, and friends at the expense of [the Housing\r\n  Authority and the Foundation].â€[9]Â  The audit stated that\r\n  any net earnings beyond those needed for â€œthe retirement of project debt or to\r\n  carry out low-income housing projects were not to inure to the benefit of any\r\n  person or entity other than the parent entity, the Authority.â€Â  As such, HUD\r\n  concluded that Smith and Nettlesâ€™ collection of over $958,738 in\r\n  development and other fees on Foundation property purchases was inappropriate.Â \r\n  The audit also opined that the Housing Authorityâ€™s agreement with the\r\n  Foundation to provide financial and administrative support was illegal because\r\n  HUD funds can only be used for projects that have been explicitly approved by\r\n  HUD. \r\nBased\r\n  on this audit, the Housing Authority filed suit against Smith regarding alleged\r\n  incentive compensation he received while Executive Director of the Housing\r\n  Authority.Â  In addition, the Foundation filed two suits in December 2002, which\r\n  were later consolidated and are now before this Court.Â  The first suit was\r\n  against the Smiths and the Nettles to recover the above-mentioned fees and\r\n  other damages,[10] and the second action\r\n  was against Smith and the Calhoun Insurance Agency for alleged misdeeds over\r\n  the purchase and subsequent lease of the Marlboro Street Property.[11]Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  April 2005, the Smiths and the Nettles filed a summary judgment motion pursuant\r\n  to Rule 56, SCRCP, as to all causes of action and alleged the New Board was\r\n  without authority to file suit on behalf of the Foundation.Â  After the trial\r\n  court held a hearing on the motion, but before it issued its order, two members\r\n  of the New Board filed an action for judicial dissolution of the Foundation and\r\n  petitioned the trial court to appoint a custodian for the Foundation pending\r\n  the outcome of the litigation.Â  On June 22, 2005, the trial court signed an\r\n  order appointing three custodians for the Foundation.[12]Â \r\n  The trial court authorized the custodians to exercise all powers of the\r\n  corporation through or in place of the New Board and to sue and defend on\r\n  behalf of the Foundation.Â  It also expressly charged the custodians with ensuring\r\n  that the Foundationâ€™s financial obligations were met, with ratifying any\r\n  actions taken by the New Board if in the best interests of the Foundation, and\r\n  with informing the trial court about the custodiansâ€™ positions on any pending\r\n  lawsuits involving the Foundation.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 23, 2005, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Smiths\r\n  and the Nettles on the grounds that the New Board was created illegally and\r\n  thus lacked the power to file suit on behalf of the Foundation.Â  The trial court\r\n  also held that the Foundationâ€™s claims against Smith for legal malpractice were\r\n  fatally flawed due to its failure to present an expert witness to establish\r\n  Smithâ€™s required duty of care.Â  Following entry of summary judgment, the\r\n  Foundation timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.\r\nOn\r\n  August 1, 2005, two days prior to the trial courtâ€™s hearing on the 59(e)\r\n  motion, the custodians filed a resolution with the trial court, ratifying the\r\n  filing of the lawsuits, which the trial court had voided in its grant of\r\n  summary judgment.Â  The trial court formally denied the Foundationâ€™s 59(e)\r\n  motion on December 9, 2005, reasoning that because the custodiansâ€™ resolution\r\n  was not before the trial court when it initially ruled on the summary judgment\r\n  motion, it would be improper to consider the custodiansâ€™ resolution in ruling\r\n  on the 59(e) motion. \r\nThe\r\n  Foundation then properly perfected an appeal to this Court on December 22,\r\n  2005.Â  Almost six months later on June 20, 2006, the Foundation moved for\r\n  relief from judgment under Rules 60(b)(2) and 60(b)(5), SCRCP, in tandem with a\r\n  motion to this Court for leave to file the 60(b) motion with the trial court.Â \r\n  On August 25, 2006, this Court granted the Foundationâ€™s motion for leave, thus\r\n  conferring jurisdiction on the trial court to address the 60(b) motion. \r\nOn\r\n  November 28, 2006, the trial court granted the Foundationâ€™s 60(b)(2), SCRCP,\r\n  motion finding the custodiansâ€™ resolution was â€œnewly discovered evidence which\r\n  by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial\r\n  . . . .â€Â  In its order, the trial court found that the New Boardâ€™s filing of\r\n  the lawsuit on behalf of the Foundation was a voidable act.Â  However, while the\r\n  New Board may have been illegally formed, because the Foundation had the\r\n  authority to bring suit in its name as a distinct jural entity, the subsequent\r\n  ratification by legally-appointed custodians cured that voidable act.Â  As a\r\n  result, the custodiansâ€™ resolution ratifying the New Boardâ€™s filing of the\r\n  lawsuits was evidence of the Foundationâ€™s intent at the time of the initial\r\n  filing.Â  Thus, the trial court relieved the Foundation from its earlier summary\r\n  judgment ruling on all causes of action except its grant of summary judgment in\r\n  favor of Smith for legal malpractice.Â  The Smiths and the Calhoun\r\n  Insurance Agency timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which the trial\r\n  court denied on March 26, 2007.[13]Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nSmith appeals the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s grant of the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP, on several grounds.[14]Â \r\n  First, Smith argues the custodiansâ€™ resolution ratifying the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  lawsuit was not â€œnewly discovered evidenceâ€ as is required for relief under\r\n  Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  Second, Smith argues the 60(b)(2) motion was filed\r\n  outside the one-year time limit and was not filed within a â€œreasonable timeâ€\r\n  after the resolution was discovered.Â  Smith additionally contends that the\r\n  custodiansâ€™ ratification of the filing of the lawsuits was invalid because the\r\n  custodians were never properly appointed.Â  Smith next argues that S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 33-31-1008 prohibits a corporation from affecting ongoing litigation\r\n  through amendments to the articles, and because the custodiansâ€™ resolution was\r\n  actually an articles amendment, the trial court erred in relying on it to grant\r\n  the Foundation relief.Â  Last, Smith alleges the trial court erred when it\r\n  addressed other issues in its 60(b) ruling, arguing this Court had granted the\r\n  trial court leave to consider only the effect of the custodiansâ€™ ratification\r\n  on these lawsuits.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether\r\n  to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court. Â Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15,\r\n  17 (1992). Â Therefore, our standard of review is limited to determining whether\r\n  there was an abuse of discretion.Â  Raby Const., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C.\r\n  10, 18, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004).Â  An abuse of discretion arises when the\r\n  order was controlled by an error of law or when the order is based on factual\r\n  conclusions that are without evidentiary support. Â Tri-County Ice &amp; Fuel\r\n    Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).\r\nLAW/ANAYSIS\r\nI. The Custodial\r\n  Resolution as Newly Discovered Evidence\r\nA. Existence of\r\n  Resolution at Time of Summary Judgment\r\nSmith\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting the 60(b) motion because the\r\n  custodial resolution was â€œmanufacturedâ€ after summary judgment and thus cannot\r\n  be deemed â€œnewly discovered evidenceâ€ under Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial court may\r\n  relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding if â€œnewly\r\n  discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in\r\n  time to move from a new trial under Rule 59(b)â€ is presented to the trial\r\n  court.Â  Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  Evidence is not â€œnewly discoveredâ€ if it is\r\n  known to the party at trial and in the partyâ€™s possession.Â  Lanier v. Lanier,\r\n  364 S.C. 211, 218, 612 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nThe newly\r\n  discovered evidence at issue is the custodiansâ€™ resolution ratifying the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s filing of the lawsuits.Â  On June 22, 2005, one day before the\r\n  trial court granted summary judgment, the trial court signed an order\r\n  appointing the custodians and charged them with reporting to the trial court\r\n  within twenty days of the orderâ€™s filing on whether it would be in the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s best interests to file a lawsuit against the Smiths and the\r\n  Calhoun Insurance Agency.Â  The trial court then granted summary judgment on\r\n  June 23, 2005.Â  The Foundation then filed a 59(e) motion, and the custodiansâ€™\r\n  resolution ratifying the lawsuits was filed less than a month later with the\r\n  trial court on August 1, 2005.Â  Because the resolution could not have been\r\n  filed with the trial court before entry of summary judgment or in time to move\r\n  for a new trial under Rule 59(b), SCRCP, the resolution is the proper subject\r\n  of a 60(b)(2) motion.[15] \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  because the trial court found the New Board was illegally constituted in its\r\n  summary judgment order, it was only with the judicial appointment of the\r\n  custodians and their subsequent investigation that the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  pre-existing intent to file suit could properly be considered by the trial\r\n  court.Â  See Peacock v. Bd. of Sch. Commâ€™rs, 721 F.2d 210, 214\r\n  (7th Cir. 1983) (generally finding that material not in existence until after\r\n  trial falls within 60(b)(2) only if it pertains to facts in existence at time\r\n  of trial).Â  While the resolution may not have been in existence until after\r\n  summary judgment was granted, the resolution was evidence of the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  corporate will at the time of filing and thus was properly considered as â€œnewly\r\n  discovered evidence.â€Â  See Gray, 298 S.C. at 287, 379 S.E.2d at\r\n  896 (finding jurorâ€™s letter to newspaper praising doctors and criticizing\r\n  parties who sue them, which was written on the same day the jury returned a\r\n  verdict in favor of the defendant doctor and published two weeks after verdict,\r\n  revealed a preexisting bias and was newly discovered evidence for purposes of\r\n  Rule 60(b)); Amesco Exports, Inc. v. Assoc. Aircraft Mfg. &amp; Sales, Inc.,\r\n  87 F.Supp.2d 1013, 1015 (C.D. Cal. 1997) (finding plaintiff corporationâ€™s\r\n  receipt of letter from tax commission advising it of conditional revival of its\r\n  corporate status constituted newly discovered evidence for purposes of 60(b)(2)\r\n  warranting relief from final judgment);Â Â  Natâ€™l Anti-Hunger Coal. v. Exec.\r\n    Comm. of the Presidentâ€™s Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, 711 F.2d\r\n  1071, 1075 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (stating task reports that came into existence\r\n  after lower courtâ€™s decision pertained to facts in existence at time of\r\n  decision which supported a finding that the reports were newly discovered\r\n  evidence within the meaning of Rule 60(b), FRCP); 11 Charles Alan Wright,\r\n  Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Â§\r\n  2859 (2d ed. 2008) (stating â€œRule 60(b)(2) has proved useful, especially when\r\n  the newly discovered evidence calls into question the validity of the judgment\r\n  by directly refuting the underpinnings of the theory which prevailedâ€).\r\nB. Establishment\r\n  of Lanier Elements as Prerequisite for 60(b) Relief \r\nSmith\r\n  additionally argues the resolution was not the proper subject of a 60(b) motion\r\n  because the Foundation failed to satisfy the first and fifth elements from Lanier\r\n    v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 612 S.E.2d 456 (Ct. App. 2005), thus forfeiting\r\n  the Foundationâ€™s right to relief under Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP. \r\nIn Lanier,\r\n  we stated that to receive a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, the\r\n  moving party must establish that the newly discovered evidence: â€œ(1) will probably change the result\r\n  if a new trial is granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could\r\n  not have been discovered before the trial; (4) is material to the issue; and\r\n  (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.â€Â  Id. at 217, 612 S.E.2d at\r\n  459.Â  The five-part test recited in Lanier is yet another way of\r\n  restating Rule 60(b)(2)â€™s requirements.Â  See 12 Mooreâ€™s Federal\r\n    Practice Â§ 60.42[2] (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (discussing various element\r\n  tests for Rule 60(b)(2)).Â  \r\nSmithâ€™s\r\n  argument that the Foundation failed to establish or even discuss the first and\r\n  fifth elements is unsubstantiated.Â  The Foundation specifically stated in its\r\n  60(b) motion that the resolution was material and determinative of the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s ability to file suit and was not cumulative or impeaching.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the trial court specifically acknowledged and applied this test\r\n  from Lanier in its 60(b) order.Â  The trial court noted the resolution\r\n  was outcome changing because the Foundation lacked the authority to bring suit\r\n  prior to the resolution.Â  With the resolutionâ€™s filing, facts supporting the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s intent to file suit were in evidence.Â  This resulted in the\r\n  revival of all causes of actions, save the legal malpractice suit, against the\r\n  Smiths, the Nettles, and the Calhoun Insurance Agency, and thus changed the\r\n  outcome.Â  In addition, the resolution was not merely cumulative or impeaching\r\n  as it was the first evidence of the Foundationâ€™s corporate intent at the time\r\n  of the filing of the lawsuits.Â  The Foundation even elaborated on the fact that\r\n  the resolution was not cumulative or impeaching at the 59(e) hearing to\r\n  reconsider the 60(b) motion.Â  Consequently, the trial court properly considered\r\n  the custodial resolution as â€œnewly discovered evidenceâ€ pursuant to Lanier and Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.\r\nII. Filing of the\r\n  Resolution within the Time Limitations of Rule 60(b)\r\nSmith claims the Foundation failed to file its Rule\r\n  60(b) motion within a reasonable time and further alleges the motion was filed\r\n  outside the absolute one-year time limit.Â  Smith contends the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  filing of its 60(b) motion with the trial court on September 12, 2006 was\r\n  untimely as the date of the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment on\r\n  June 23, 2005, rather than the date of its order denying the Foundationâ€™s 59(e)\r\n  motion on December 9, 2005, controls.Â  We disagree.\r\nA Rule 60(b)(2)\r\n  motion â€œshall be made within a reasonable time, and . . . not more than one year\r\n  after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.â€Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  The one-year limit is non-discretionary, whereas the â€œreasonable timeâ€\r\n  limit is discretionary and should be determined under the facts and\r\n  circumstance of each case.Â  Coleman, 303 S.C. at 513, 402 S.E.2d at 183. Â \r\nThe\r\n  precise question presented in this case is whether the time limit, which\r\n  normally runs from the date of the judgmentâ€™s entry, is stayed by the filing of\r\n  a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Rule 203(b), SCACR, which discusses the motions that stay\r\n  the time to file an appeal, is instructive on this question.Â  The rule states: \r\n\r\n\tWhen a\r\n  timely motion for judgment n.o.v. (Rule 50, SCRCP), motion to alter or amend\r\n  the judgment (Rules 52 and 59, SCRCP), or a motion for a new trial (Rule 59,\r\n  SCRCP) has been made, the time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed and\r\n  shall run from receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or\r\n  denying such motion. When a form or other short order or judgment indicates\r\n  that a more full and complete order or judgment is to follow, a party need not\r\n  appeal until receipt of written notice of entry of the more complete order or\r\n  judgment.\r\n\r\nRule\r\n  203(b)(1), SCACR.\r\nUnder this rule, if\r\n  a party does not have to appeal to this Court while a 59(e) motion is pending\r\n  because the finality of the challenged judgment has been removed, it follows\r\n  that a party does not have to file a 60(b) motion with the trial court until\r\n  the trial court issues its ruling on the 59(e) motion.Â  See Coward\r\n    Hund Const. Co., Inc. v. Ball Corp., 336 S.C. 1, 3, 518 S.E.2d 56, 58 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999) (basing the commencement of the time period for appeal on the\r\n  finality of a judgment).Â  For the same reason, a trial court plausibly could amend\r\n  not only a judgment but also could reconsider its prior ruling on issues or\r\n  arguments in response to a 59(e) motion.Â  See Elam, 361 S.C. at\r\n  21, 602 S.E.2d at 779 (stating â€œit is proper to view a Rule 59(e) motion not\r\n  only as a vehicle to request the trial court to â€˜alter or amend the judgment,â€™\r\n  but also as a vehicle to seek â€˜reconsiderationâ€™ of issues and argumentsâ€). Â If\r\n  a party were forced to file a 60(b) motion before it receives the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  59(e) ruling, it would create unnecessary paperwork for the court system,\r\n  increased costs and fees, and greater confusion for the parties.Â  Unless the\r\n  newly discovered evidence is revealed in time to move for a new trial under\r\n  Rule 59(b), a partyâ€™s only choice is to wait on the trial courtâ€™s 59(e) ruling\r\n  and then promptly file a 60(b) motion.Â  As in the instant case, it is possible that\r\n  the trial court could take several months to formally rule on a 59(e) motion.Â \r\n  Under Smithâ€™s view of 60(b), the trial courtâ€™s timeliness in granting or\r\n  denying a Rule 59(e) motion could result in prejudice to the moving party,\r\n  which we believe is inherently unfair.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  granted summary judgment in Smithâ€™s favor on June 23, 2005, and formally denied\r\n  the Foundationâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion on December 9, 2005.Â  Based on the\r\n  above-stated reasoning, the one-year deadline for filing the Foundationâ€™s Rule\r\n  60(b) motion began to run at the entry of summary judgment and then was tolled\r\n  with the Foundationâ€™s filing of the 59(e) motion.Â  The time to file then began\r\n  to run again when the trial court denied the Foundationâ€™s 59(e) motion on December\r\n  9, 2005.Â  The Foundation properly filed its 60(b) motion on September 12, 2006,\r\n  well within the one-year time frame.Â  Moreover, the Foundation filed the motion\r\n  within a â€œreasonable timeâ€ as it properly requested leave to file the 60(b)\r\n  motion with this Court on June 20, 2006.Â  See Rule 60, SCRCP (stating\r\n  that â€œ[d]uring the pendency of an appeal, leave to make [a 60(b)] motion must\r\n  be obtained from the appellate courtâ€). We ruled on the motion on August 25,\r\n  2006, and the Foundation promptly filed its 60(b) motion with the trial court\r\n  less than a month after this Courtâ€™s ruling.Â  As such, the 60(b) motion was\r\n  filed both within the one-year time limit and within a reasonable time.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Lawful Appointment of\r\n  Custodians[16]\r\nSmith argues the custodiansâ€™ ratification of the\r\n  lawsuits was null and void because the trial court was without authority to\r\n  lawfully appoint the custodians.Â  Smith contends Buccie Harley (Harley) and\r\n  Doug Haley (Haley), the petitioners for custodial appointment, were not within\r\n  the class of persons allowed to petition for judicial dissolution, so the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s appointment of the custodians during the pendency of the judicial\r\n  dissolution was void.Â  We disagree.\r\nHarley and Haley,\r\n  as members of the New Board, petitioned the trial court for judicial\r\n  dissolution pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1430 (Supp. 2007) and for\r\n  custodial appointment pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1432 (Supp. 2007).[17]Â \r\n  Whether or not they were de jure directors on the New Board, they acted under\r\n  color of authority to protect the interests of the Foundation.Â  See Vestry\r\n    of St. Lukeâ€™s Church v. Matthews, 4 S.C. Eq. 578, 587-88 (1815) (finding an\r\n  appointee may become a de jure officer when appointed by a de facto board or\r\n  officer).Â  When a â€œde factoâ€ director or officer acts under color of right in\r\n  assuming or performing a duty of that office, the action is sustainable.Â  See id. at 587 (stating â€œtrustees, even if not regularly elected, were at\r\n  least trustees by colour [sic] of office, and their acts would be goodâ€); see\r\n    also 19 C.J.S. Corporations Â§ 560 (2008) (stating a person may exercise the\r\n  duties of an officer or director if the person possesses the office and exercises\r\n  its duties under an appearance of right even if he or she is not an officer or director\r\n  de jure by reason of ineligibility or lack of qualification or being unlawfully\r\n  elected); 18B Am.Jur.2d Corporations Â§ 1411 (2008) (noting that â€œ[i]f the\r\n  officers of a corporation exceed their authority and the act is one that could\r\n  have been authorized in the first instance, the act may be expressly or\r\n  impliedly ratified and, thus, be rendered just as binding as if it had been\r\n  authorized when doneâ€); cf. State v. Miller, 565 P.2d 228, 229 (Kan.\r\n  1977) (finding that a â€œde facto officerâ€ is a person who assumes and performs a\r\n  duty of office under color of authority and is recognized and accepted as a rightful\r\n  holder of office, despite defects in the manner of appointment or his or her\r\n  failure to conform to a condition precedent).Â  Thus, because they acted under\r\n  color of authority to carry out a lawful act, Harley and Haleyâ€™s petition for\r\n  judicial dissolution under Â§ 33-31-1430(a)(2) is sustainable at law. \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Smithâ€™s argument ignores the fact that the Housing Authority and the Foundation\r\n  are in a statutorily-created relationship that renders the Foundation\r\n  accountable to the Housing Authority.Â  While Smith argues the New Boardâ€™s\r\n  failure to be elected by the Former Board, as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-31-804(b), prevented the New Board from being valid, this argument ignores\r\n  the interplay of the provisions of the National Housing Act.Â  The Foundation is\r\n  a South Carolina nonprofit corporation, and thus subject to the South Carolina\r\n  Nonprofit Act, but it is also created pursuant to the National Housing Act and\r\n  as a result is subject to those provisions as well.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the National Housing Act, the Foundation is â€œan agency or instrumentalityâ€ of\r\n  the â€œparent entityâ€ Housing Authority.Â  24 C.F.R. Â§ 811.102.Â  As reflected in\r\n  the Foundationâ€™s bylaws, one of its purposes is to â€œotherwise assist and be\r\n  utilized as a â€˜public housing agencyâ€™ [as] approved by the Department of\r\n  Housing and Urban Development . . . [and] by the South Carolina Regional\r\n  Housing Authority No. 3.â€Â  The Housing Authority has a vested interest in\r\n  preserving and protecting the Foundationâ€™s assets, as the bylaws state, â€œIn the\r\n  event of the dissolution of the [Foundation] . . . the [Foundationâ€™s] property\r\n  shall be given, conveyed and distributed to and shall vest in the South Carolina\r\n  Regional Housing Authority No. 3 . . . .â€Â  This provision reflects the federal\r\n  requirement â€œthat upon dissolution of the applicant, title to or other interest\r\n  in any real or personal property that is owned by such applicant at the time of\r\n  dissolution shall be transferred to the parent entity [public housing\r\n  authority].â€Â  24 C.F.R. Â§ 811.105(c)(6).Â  Because of this relationship, the\r\n  Housing Authority has a direct interest in the affairs of the Foundation.Â \r\n  Without Harley and Haleyâ€™s initiation of the dissolution and custodial\r\n  appointment proceedings, the Housing Authorityâ€™s ability to preserve and\r\n  protect assets to which it is statutorily entitled could be threatened.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  regardless of whether Harley and Haley petitioned the trial court as the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  de jure or de facto directors, we note that neither Smith nor his counsel\r\n  appeared at the hearing for custodial appointment, even after having received\r\n  notice as an interested party.Â  At the Rule 59(e) hearing to reconsider the\r\n  60(b) motion, Smithâ€™s counsel told the trial court that he did not attend the\r\n  custodian hearing because the appointment would not affect Smith, but agreed at\r\n  that time that â€œit was a very good idea that the custodian[s] be appointed.â€Â \r\n  Despite Smithâ€™s role and interest in the Foundation and the Housing Authority,\r\n  he never sought to intervene, which we fail to understand given Smithâ€™s current\r\n  position on the custodiansâ€™ appointment.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on all of the above, the trial courtâ€™s appointment of the custodians was\r\n  proper.Â  Because their appointment was valid, the trial court was within its\r\n  power to charge the custodians with exercising all the powers of the\r\n  Foundation, including the power to sue and defend on behalf of the Foundation.Â  \r\nIV. Custodial Resolutionâ€™s\r\n  Effect on Ongoing Litigation \r\nSmith contends the trial courtâ€™s consideration of the\r\n  custodial resolution at the 60(b) hearing was error as the Foundation is\r\n  statutorily prohibited from affecting ongoing litigation through an articles\r\n  amendment. Â We disagree.Â Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-31-1008 (Supp. 2007) states, â€œAn amendment to [the] articles of\r\n  incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of\r\n  the corporation, [or] a proceeding to which the corporation is a party . . . .â€ \r\nSmith argues the\r\n  resolution filed with the Secretary of State is an articles amendment and thus\r\n  was improperly before the trial court at the 60(b) hearing.Â  However, the\r\n  document at issue is entitled, â€œResolution To Approve, Adopt &amp; Ratify\r\n  Previous Actions Of The Corporation And To Take Additional Actions With Respect\r\n  Thereto.â€Â  Within the body of the resolution, there is no mention of any\r\n  amendments to the articles and the language specifically states, â€œThis resolution is adopted by the Corporation with the unanimous written consent of the\r\n  Custodians as evidenced by their individual signatures below.â€ (emphasis\r\n  added). Â \r\nDavid\r\n  Miller (Miller), one of the court-appointed custodians, filed the resolution\r\n  with the Secretary of State and testified at the 60(b) hearing.Â  Miller stated\r\n  that he went to file the resolution â€œlate in the dayâ€ on June 28, 2005, and\r\n  when he handed it to a clerk at the Secretary of State, she returned it with a\r\n  coversheet entitled, â€œNonprofit Corporation Articles of Amendment.â€Â  Miller testified\r\n  he specifically told the clerk it was not an articles amendment.Â  The clerk\r\n  stated the coversheet was a formality and had to be completed for the\r\n  resolution to be filed with the Secretary of State.Â  When Miller filled out the\r\n  coversheet, most of his responses were â€œn/a [not applicable]â€ as the questions\r\n  pertained to amending the articles of the corporation.Â  Miller stated the\r\n  coversheet was not attached to the resolution when he came to the Secretary of\r\n  Stateâ€™s office, and were it not for the clerkâ€™s insistence that it be filled\r\n  out as a prerequisite to filing the resolution, he would not have completed it. \r\nMillerâ€™s\r\n  testimony and the resolution itself prove it was not an articles amendment but\r\n  was a properly-created custodial resolution.Â  Further, while Smith argues the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s failure to take corrective action renders the resolution an\r\n  articles amendment that cannot be considered for purposes of this litigation,\r\n  any alleged error was on the face of the coversheet, not within the body of the\r\n  resolution.Â  The coversheet was not created by the custodians or the\r\n  Foundation, rather it was a â€œform revised by the South Carolina Secretary of\r\n  Stateâ€ and per the filing instructions on the coversheet, two copies of the\r\n  form had to be completed for the resolution to be filed.Â  As the coversheet was\r\n  not contained within the body of the resolution and there are no facts within\r\n  the resolution to indicate it is an articles amendment, the trial court\r\n  properly considered the resolution at the 60(b) hearing. \r\nV. Whether the Trial Court\r\n  Considered Matters Outside the Scope of its Jurisdiction in its 60(b) Order\r\nSmith\r\n  lastly argues that all causes of action against him were essentially legal\r\n  malpractice claims.Â  Smith contends that the Foundationâ€™s failure to present an\r\n  expert at summary judgment thus extinguished all of the Foundationâ€™s causes of\r\n  action against him.Â  Smith claims that because the issue of the necessity of a\r\n  legal malpractice expert is still on appeal, the trial court did not have\r\n  jurisdiction to reinstate all of the causes of action against Smith as the\r\n  legal malpractice issue encompassed the remaining causes of action.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s\r\n  summary judgment order stated that all causes of action against Smith,\r\n  including â€œlegal malpractice, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy,\r\n  misappropriation of assets, tortious interference with contract, and\r\n  constructive trust . . . are based on some alleged breach of duty or loyalty to\r\n  the Foundation or some conflict of interest in disregard of the Foundationâ€™s\r\n  rights.â€Â  Smith argues this statement proves that Smithâ€™s legal representation\r\n  of the Foundation is a common thread in all of the Foundationâ€™s claims.\r\nHowever,\r\n  before the trial court issued the summary judgment order, it notified the\r\n  parties in writing that â€œan expert witness would be required to establish a\r\n  standard of care and any deviations therefrom on the legal malpractice\r\n    actions.â€ (emphasis added).Â  After receiving this letter, Smithâ€™s counsel\r\n  drafted a proposed summary judgment order dismissing â€œthese actionsâ€ against\r\n  Smith for the Foundationâ€™s failure to name an expert.Â  At the 59(e) hearing to\r\n  reconsider the 60(b) motion, when the trial court realized Smith construed the\r\n  summary judgment order as dismissing all causes of action against Smith, the\r\n  trial court clarified any misconceptions regarding the scope of its prior\r\n  order.Â  The trial court stated, \r\n\r\n\tMy\r\n  intention was to send it back to let everything be heard except the legal\r\n  malpractice claim . . . [The Foundation] didnâ€™t give me an expert and the legal\r\n  malpractice case was gone and everything else against Mr. Smith was viable\r\n  except for [the Foundation] didnâ€™t follow the corporate formalities . . . all\r\n  other issues not dealing with legal malpractice, weâ€™re back to square one where\r\n  weâ€™re going to try the case. . . . What I intended to do all along was to\r\n  dismiss the legal malpractice case because there was no expert.Â  I also\r\n  dismissed the other part of the case because [] corporate formalities were not\r\n  followed.Â  I overrule or change my mind on that based on the corporate\r\n  resolution.Â  I am still of the opinion which leaves us with the legal\r\n  malpractice case gone and the other actions, whatever they may be, if any,\r\n  still pending.\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n  the trial court may have initially stated that the lack of a legal expert\r\n  affected all of the claims against Smith, the court had the power to amend and\r\n  clarify any misconceptions at the 59(e) stage.Â  See Rule 59, SCRCP.Â \r\n  Smith raised the issue of whether the trial court had jurisdiction in his 59(e)\r\n  motion, and the trial court was proper to address this issue at the 59(e)\r\n  hearing.Â  See Elam, 361 S.C. at 24, 602 S.E.2d at 780 (â€œA party may wish to file [] a [59(e)] motion when [the party] believes the court has\r\n  misunderstood, failed to fully consider, or perhaps failed to rule on an\r\n  argument or issue, and the party wishes for the court to reconsider or rule on\r\n  it.â€) (emphasis in original). \r\nThe\r\n  trial courtâ€™s 60(b) ruling demonstrates the intended scope of the order as\r\n  well: â€œ[The Foundation] is relieved from summary judgment in both actions on all causes of action except the aforementioned legal malpractice action against John Michael Smith.â€ (emphasis added).Â  The trial court clearly\r\n  intended for the ratification to moot all issues regarding the exercise of\r\n  corporate powers and to restore all the causes of action, except the legal\r\n  malpractice claim.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the pleadings show the legal malpractice claim was distinct from the other\r\n  claims as it was a separately pled cause of action against Smith in the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s first complaint.Â  As such, the Foundationâ€™s failure to proffer an\r\n  expert for that claim in no way affects the Foundationâ€™s remaining claims for civil conspiracy, negligence, misappropriation of\r\n  assets, tortious interference with\r\n  contract, and constructive trust.[18]Â  Those remaining causes\r\n  of actions are still viable as to Smith, his wife, and the Calhoun Insurance\r\n  Agency.Â  A legal malpractice expert would not aid the jury in determining\r\n  whether the Foundation should recover for those claims, as Smithâ€™s wife is not\r\n  an attorney and the Calhoun Insurance Agency is not a law firm.Â  Consequently,\r\n  the trial court was within its power to find that the custodial resolution\r\n  ratifying the filing of the lawsuits revived all causes of action, exclusive of\r\n  the legal malpractice claim, against the Smiths and the Calhoun Insurance\r\n  Agency. \r\nVI. Foundationâ€™s Failure\r\n  to Proffer an Expert Witness\r\nThe\r\n  Foundation argues the trial court erred in finding that the lack of an expert\r\n  witness was fatal to the Foundationâ€™s legal malpractice action against Smith,\r\n  as Smithâ€™s actions were obvious violations of his legal duties.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn South Carolina,\r\n  the plaintiff in a legal malpractice suit must prove several elements: (1) the\r\n  existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) a breach of duty by the\r\n  attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  damages by the breach.â€Â  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 174, 561 S.E.2d\r\n  654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Typically, a plaintiff in\r\n  a legal malpractice case must establish the standard of care through expert\r\n  testimony, unless the subject matter is of common\r\n  knowledge to laypersons. Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 295-96, 592 S.E.2d 315, 319 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  With the aid of expert testimony, â€œthe jury is\r\n  able to analyze the attorneyâ€™s conduct and measure it against the action that a\r\n  competent attorney would be expected to take under the same circumstances.â€Â  Cianbro\r\n    Corp. v. Jeffcoat &amp; Martin, 804 F.Supp. 784, 793 (D.S.C. 1992).\r\nThe Foundation\r\n  argues that Smithâ€™s malpractice falls within the common knowledge exception\r\n  because his actions are statutorily prohibited by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 31-3-360\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  Section 31-3-360 prohibits an employee or commissioner of a\r\n  housing authority from â€œacquir[ing] any interest, direct or indirect, in any\r\n  project or in any property included or planned to be included in any project,\r\n  nor shall [an employee] have any interest, direct or indirect, in any contract\r\n  or proposed contract for materials or services to be furnished or used in\r\n  connection with any project.â€Â Â  \r\nBecause Smith recouped attorney and development fees\r\n  over the course of his employment with the Housing Authority, the Foundation\r\n  argues he was plainly in contravention of the statute, and thus no expert was\r\n  necessary. While Smith may be liable for any inappropriate commissions or fees\r\n  recouped during his tenure as a director or a board member pursuant to this\r\n  section, this statute is not conclusive on whether he breached a duty to the\r\n  Foundation as its attorney.Â  Further, given the extended duration of Smithâ€™s\r\n  involvement with the Foundation and the Housing Authority and the complex nature\r\n  of many of the property and business transactions in which he represented the\r\n  Foundation, the Foundation should have presented expert testimony, by affidavit\r\n  or otherwise, at the summary judgment stage.Â  As the standard of care for legal\r\n  malpractice is outside the ambit of the common knowledge of laypersons, the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s failure to present this evidence precludes the Foundation from\r\n  bringing the legal malpractice claim against Smith at trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  HUFF, J., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For ease of reference, the Court will refer to\r\n  â€œSmithâ€ throughout the opinion for any claims pertaining to Smith, Smithâ€™s\r\n  wife, and the Calhoun Insurance Agency. \r\n[2] Because the Foundation will have received its\r\n  requested relief, its remaining issues on appeal will be moot.Â  See Seabrook\r\n    v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191, 197, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006) (recognizing that\r\n  this Court will not decide questions on which a judgment rendered will have no\r\n  practical legal effect). \r\n[3] The Foundation was originally named â€œSoutheastern\r\n  South Carolina Housing, Inc.â€Â  Its name was officially changed on June 5, 1997\r\n  to â€œSoutheastern Housing Foundationâ€ to reflect its status as a public benefit\r\n  corporation.Â  \r\n[4] As amended and consolidated with other housing\r\n  statutes to form the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C.A.\r\n  Â§Â§ 1437 to 1437z-8.\r\n[5] Smith, as an original incorporator of the Foundation,\r\n  served as a member of the Foundationâ€™s board of directors from its inception in\r\n  1976 until he resigned in July 1997.Â  \r\n[6] When the Foundation entered into this agreement with\r\n  the Housing Authority, Nettles was both the Executive Director of the\r\n  Foundation and Director of Management of the Housing Authority and Smith was\r\n  the part-time Executive Director of the Housing Authority. Â This coterminous\r\n  representation is permissible pursuant to 24 C.F.R. Â§ 811.105(e) (2008) (â€œMembers,\r\n  officers, or employees of the parent entity [public housing authority] may be\r\n  directors or officers of the applicant unless this is contrary to state law.â€).\r\n[7] Smith alleges the New Board failed to follow\r\n  statutory guidelines in filing its unanimous consent resolution to remove the\r\n  Former Board and in obtaining the written resignations of the Former Board.Â \r\n  Because we find the court-appointed custodians, acting as the Foundation, had\r\n  the authority to file the lawsuits, we decline to address these arguments as\r\n  the boardâ€™s former or present constitution has no bearing on the ability of the\r\n  Foundation to file suit.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[8] Because the Foundation was a recipient of annual\r\n  contribution contracts for its low-income housing projects, 42 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  1437c(h)(1) required the Foundation to provide HUD with the right to audit.\r\n[9] At the time of the audit in 1999, the respective board\r\n  members included: (1) Nettlesâ€™ wife, Dawn Nettles; (2) Smithâ€™s wife, Sally\r\n  Smith; (3) Smithâ€™s employee, Melissa Still; (4) Dawn Nettlesâ€™ mother, Kathleen\r\n  Norton; (5) Sally Smithâ€™s brother-in-law, Bobby Kinard; (6) Sally Smithâ€™s niece\r\n  and Bobby Kinardâ€™s daughter, Julie Welch; and (7) Dawn Nettlesâ€™ sister, Valerie\r\n  Kraun. \r\n[10] The Foundation also sued Smithâ€™s wife, Sally Smith,\r\n  and Nettlesâ€™ wife, Dawn Nettles, due to their employment with the Foundation at\r\n  the time of the alleged wrongdoings.Â  The Foundation has since settled its case\r\n  against the Nettles.Â  \r\n[11] The Foundation filed suit against Smith and the\r\n  Calhoun Insurance Agency for breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference\r\n  with contract, and constructive trust.Â  These claims stemmed from the purchase\r\n  and subsequent leasing of the Marlboro Street Property, which was used by the\r\n  Foundation and the Housing Authority for office space.Â  The Foundation\r\n  alleged that Smith, while legal counsel for the Foundation, improperly assigned\r\n  the sales contract to himself, charged property taxes to the Foundation, which\r\n  otherwise would not have accrued due to its 501(c)(3) status, and improperly\r\n  assessed improvements and rental fees against the Foundation. See Southeastern\r\n    Housing Foundation f/k/a Southeastern South Carolina Housing, Inc. v. Calhoun\r\n    Insurance Agency, Inc., and John Michael Smith, C/A No. 02-CP-06-315. \r\n[12] The trial court entered its initial order appointing\r\n  the custodians on June 6, 2005.Â  After receiving comments from the parties, the\r\n  trial court amended its initial order on June 22, 2005 and filed the order on\r\n  June 24, 2005. \r\n[13] The Foundation contends that Smithâ€™s appeal is\r\n  untimely because he failed to appeal the 60(b) motion within thirty days of its\r\n  issuance.Â  The Foundation argues that a Rule 59(e) motion is only appropriate\r\n  to alter or amend a â€œjudgment,â€ and because the grant of the 60(b) motion\r\n  neither dismisses the action nor finally determines the rights of any party, it\r\n  is not a judgment within the meaning of the Rules.Â  Thus, the 60(b) motion was untimely\r\n  because the time to appeal was not stayed upon the filing of the 59(e) motion.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  Under this analysis, if the trial court fails to address issues\r\n  raised by a party at the 60(b) stage, the party would be forced to file a\r\n  direct appeal without the benefit of first submitting a 59(e) motion to the\r\n  trial court. Further, while a Rule 59(e) motion is a vehicle to alter or amend\r\n  a judgment, it is also a means to reconsider previously raised issues and\r\n  arguments.Â  See Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 21,\r\n  602 S.E.2d 772, 778 (2004).Â  Without first submitting a 59(e) motion to the\r\n  trial court, this Court could then dispose of the partyâ€™s arguments on error\r\n  preservation principles.Â  See Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n  338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (â€œThe losing party must first try\r\n  to convince the lower court it is [sic] has ruled wrongly and then, if that\r\n  effort fails, convince the appellate court that the lower court erred. This\r\n  principle underlies the long-established preservation requirement that the\r\n  losing party generally must both present his issues and arguments to the lower\r\n  court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will review those issues\r\n  and arguments.â€). Â Because Rules 59 and 60(b) must be read together, Smithâ€™s\r\n  59(e) motion in response to the 60(b) ruling was proper.Â  See Gray v.\r\n    Bryant, 298 S.C. 285, 287, 379 S.E.2d 894, 895 (1989) (â€œIt is our view that\r\n  Rules 59 and 60(b) must be read together.â€).Â  \r\n[14] Even if the order granting the 60(b) motion is\r\n  not immediately appealable, this Court may review an interlocutory order when\r\n  the order is coupled with an appealable issue.Â  See Edge v. State\r\n    Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 511, 517, 623 S.E.2d 387, 390 (2005); Briggs\r\n      v. Richardson, 273 S.C. 376, 379 n.1, 256 S.E.2d 544, 546 n.1 (1979); Pitts\r\n        v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 338, 574 S.E.2d 502, 511-12\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002); Cox v. Woodmen of World Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 460, 469,\r\n  556 S.E.2d 397, 402 (Ct. App. 2001). But cf.Â  Pocisk v. Sea Coast\r\n    Constr., Op. No. 4460 (S.C. Ct. App. filed November 20, 2008) (Shearouse\r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 44 at 49) (finding partiesâ€™ appeal from trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  granting 60(b) reliefÂ  was not immediately appealable where the 60(b) order was\r\n  the only issue before this Court and the orderâ€™s appealability was specifically\r\n  raised on appeal).Â  Because the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the\r\n  Foundationâ€™s legal malpractice claim is a final determination that is properly\r\n  before this Court, we believe judicial economy argues for the resolution of\r\n  Smithâ€™s arguments on the 60(b) motion at this time.Â  See Edge,\r\n  366 S.C. at 517, 623 S.E.2d at 390 (finding resolution of partial denial of\r\n  motion to dismiss was proper when it was coupled with appeal from partial grant\r\n  of motion to dismiss because resolution of both was â€œin an effort to avoid\r\n  another appeal in the future and potentially narrow the issues for trial (i.e.\r\n  judicial economy)â€).\r\n[15] A motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59(b) â€œshall\r\n  be made not later than 10 days after the receipt of written notice of the entry\r\n  of judgment or of the filing of an order disposing of the action, if no\r\n  judgment has been entered.â€Â  Rule 59, SCRCP.Â  \r\n[16] The Foundation asserts in its brief that Smith cannot\r\n  attack the validity of the custodians as Smith never appealed from the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s appointment order, and thus, Smithâ€™s attack on the validity of the\r\n  custodial appointment is an improper collateral attack.Â  Because the\r\n  appointment of a custodian, as contrasted with the appointment of a receiver,\r\n  is an interlocutory order and thus not immediately appealable based on this\r\n  Courtâ€™s decision in Shapemasters Golf Course Buiders, Inc., v. Shapemasters,\r\n    Inc., 360 S.C. 473, 602 S.E.2d 83 (Ct. App. 2004), we will address Smithâ€™s\r\n  argument.Â  We express no opinion on whether Smithâ€™s failure to appear at the\r\n  hearing on the custodiansâ€™ appointment renders his attack on the appointment\r\n  improper.Â  \r\n[17] Harley and Haley also served coextensively on the\r\n  Housing Authorityâ€™s Board of Commissioners when they petitioned for judicial\r\n  dissolution and custodial appointment. Â See 24 C.F.R. Â§ 811.105(e)\r\n  (2008) (â€œMembers, officers, or employees of the parent entity PHA may be\r\n  directors of officers of the applicant unless this is contrary to state law.â€).\r\n[18] We recognize the dismissal of the legal malpractice\r\n  claim would extinguish the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action against\r\n  Smith in the first action.Â  However, whether Smith can still be found to have\r\n  breached a duty to the Foundation as the Executive Director of the Housing\r\n  Authority, as the registered agent and shareholder of the Calhoun Insurance Agency,\r\n  or as a board member of the Foundation in the second action is still a jury\r\n  question regardless of his role as the Foundationâ€™s attorney.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4469","title":"Hartfield v.

Hartfield, individually and as Conservator to Jon Hartfield,\r\n  (collectively referred to as Hartfield) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a\r\n  directed verdict in favor of Respondents\r\n  Robert Cockrell, individually and d/b/a Williams Package and South Pointe Pub\r\n  (collectively referred to as the Pub).Â  Hartfield contends the circuit court\r\n  erred in directing a verdict in favor of the Pub because there was sufficient\r\n  evidence presented to the court to survive the Pubâ€™s motion for a directed\r\n  verdict.Â  Hartfield also contends the circuit court erroneously required direct\r\n  evidence of service of alcohol and level of intoxication.Â  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nHoyt Helton was a frequent drinker who many considered\r\n  an alcoholic.Â  Heltonâ€™s wife testified that over the course of their eleven-year\r\n  marriage, Helton drank Bud Light or Budweiser beer every day, and had gotten in\r\n  trouble for drinking and driving â€œa number of times.â€Â  She also\r\n  described Heltonâ€™s drinking style as a â€œsipper,â€ and said that he weighed\r\n  between one-hundred thirty, and one-hundred fifty pounds.Â  On July 11, 2003,\r\n  after an evening out at several drinking establishments, Helton crossed the\r\n  centerline of a highway in a car he was driving.Â  Heltonâ€™s vehicle struck a car\r\n  driven by Laura Riddle, and in which Jon Hartfield was a passenger.Â  Helton\r\n  died at the scene.Â  Testing conducted after the accident revealed Heltonâ€™s\r\n  blood alcohol content (BAC) was .212.Â  Riddle and Hartfield were seriously\r\n  injured, and Hartfield was in a coma for several months after the accident.Â  As\r\n  a result of his injuries, Hartfield requires assisted living arrangements for\r\n  the remainder of his life.Â  \r\nOn the day of the\r\n  accident, Helton left his house sometime between 1:15 and 5:45 p.m., according\r\n  to his wife.Â  Cockrell, one of two owners and managers of the Pub, was tending\r\n  bar at the Pub on that particular day and testified Helton arrived between 4\r\n  and 4:15 p.m.Â  Helton exited the Pub at approximately 5:30 p.m.Â  Cockrell did\r\n  not see Helton again until he was closing for the night at 7 p.m., when he saw\r\n  Helton sitting on a bench in front of the Pub.Â  In addition, Cockrell testified\r\n  he neither served Helton a beer, nor saw him drinking while he was inside the\r\n  establishment, and testified Helton was not in possession of a beer on the\r\n  bench when Cockrell left.Â  \r\nBrad Harrison, a\r\n  drinking buddy of Heltonâ€™s, testified he arrived at the Pub that day around 6 p.m.\r\n  and Helton was sitting outside on a bench.Â  Harrison recalled Helton was not\r\n  drinking, and that from the time Harrison arrived, until 7:10 p.m. when he\r\n  left, Helton did not drink a beverage of any kind.Â  Thereafter, Helton made his\r\n  way to the The Getaway Lounge\r\n  &amp; Grill, Inc. (The Getaway), where\r\n  the bartender that evening, Diane Bice, testified Helton arrived between 7:15\r\n  and 7:30 p.m.Â  According to her testimony, Helton left The Getaway around 8 p.m.,\r\n  and in the time he was there, Bice neither served nor observed Helton\r\n  drinking.Â  Harrison, however, testified he arrived at The Getaway at 8 p.m.,\r\n  and while he was there, Helton was sitting at the bar and consumed two to three\r\n  beers.Â  Both Harrison and Bice testified Helton did not appear intoxicated\r\n  while at The Getaway.Â  \r\nFinally, Helton\r\n  made his way to The Carolina\r\n  Lounge (Carolina), where bartender Billy\r\n  McDonald testified Helton arrived at approximately 10 p.m. and left shortly\r\n  thereafter around 10:15 p.m.Â  McDonald recalled Helton sat at the bar and was\r\n  not served a beer; however, Highway Patrolman Tony Keller testified he spoke\r\n  with McDonald on the phone shortly after the accident, and McDonald admitted\r\n  Helton had been served and had consumed one beer at Carolina.Â  McDonald also\r\n  told Keller that Helton was sober when he left Carolina at 10:15 p.m.Â  The\r\n  accident occurred at approximately 10:51 p.m.Â  \r\nHartfield filed\r\n  suit against Cockrell, individually, and the Pub; Shou-Mei Morris, individually, and The Getaway Lounge &amp; Grill, Inc.;\r\n  and Glenn McDonald, d/b/a The\r\n  Carolina Lounge.Â  Hartfield contended\r\n  each of the defendants was negligent, grossly negligent, careless, reckless,\r\n  willful and wanton, under a rubric of dram shop liability, and that the\r\n  defendantsâ€™ actions were the direct and proximate cause of the injuries and\r\n  damages he received. Â At the close of Hartfieldâ€™s case, the circuit court\r\n  granted Cockrellâ€™s and the Pubâ€™s motions for directed verdict.Â  A jury verdict\r\n  was obtained against Morris and The Getaway, and the circuit court declared a\r\n  mistrial as to McDonald and Carolina.Â  Only the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a\r\n  directed verdict in favor of the Pub is before this court on appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHartfield contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  directing a verdict in favor of the Pub because there was sufficient evidence\r\n  presented to the court from which a reasonable juror could find Helton appeared\r\n  visibly intoxicated and was served alcohol at the Pub.Â  Hartfield also contends\r\n  the circuit court erred by requiring direct evidence of service of alcohol and\r\n  level of intoxication, rather than finding the circumstantial evidence provided\r\n  at trial created a sufficient jury question.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 61-4-580 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) prohibits the sale of beer or wine to an\r\n  intoxicated person.Â  That section specifically provides:\r\n\r\n\tProhibited\r\n  acts.\r\n\tNo\r\n  holder of a permit authorizing the sale of beer or wine or a servant, agent, or\r\n  employee of the permittee may knowingly commit any of the following acts upon\r\n  the licensed premises covered by the holderâ€™s permit:\r\n\t. . .\r\n\t(2)\r\n  sell beer or wine to an intoxicated person[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-580(2).Â \r\n  This Court has previously held that Â§ 61-4-580â€™s predecessor supplied a private\r\n  cause of action for civil liability to a third party who is injured as a result\r\n  of a violation of the statute.Â  Daley v. Ward, 303 S.C. 81, 83-84, 399\r\n  S.E.2d 13, 14 (Ct. App. 1990) (interpreting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-9-410 (1976)).\r\nAs indicated above,\r\n  testimony from all parties who witnessed Helton on the night of the accident\r\n  was that he was neither visibly intoxicated, nor actually served alcohol while\r\n  at the Pub. Â As a result, Hartfield called a series of experts to establish\r\n  Heltonâ€™s intoxication at the time he died, and by virtue of his height, weight,\r\n  drinking style, and the nightâ€™s general timeline, introduced circumstantial\r\n  evidence to prove Helton would have been visibly intoxicated during the time he\r\n  was at the Pub.Â  Dr. William Brewer was qualified before the court as an expert\r\n  in toxicology.Â  Brewer testified as to the general effects of alcohol on people\r\n  based on their physical characteristics, as well as the physical manifestations\r\n  an intoxicated person would exhibit given the level of his or her\r\n  intoxication.Â  Brewer then explained to the jury how retrograde extrapolation[1] could be used to determine the level of intoxication of a person at any point\r\n  during the night.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  ultimately prevented parts of Brewerâ€™s retrograde extrapolation analysis from\r\n  introduction before the jury.Â  Hartfield contends the proffered circumstantial\r\n  evidence may be used to establish service of alcohol and the level of a personâ€™s\r\n  intoxication at the time of service.Â  In support of this contention, Hartfield\r\n  points to several other courts and jurisdictions that have allowed the\r\n  introduction of circumstantial evidence in dram shop cases. See Alaniz\r\n    v. Rebello Food &amp; Beverage, L.L.C., 165 S.W.3d 7 (Tex. App. 2005); Romano\r\n      v. Stanley, 684 N.E.2d 19 (N.Y. 1997); People v. Ladd, 675 N.E.2d\r\n  1211 (N.Y. 1996).Â  In addition, Hartfield cites Daley v. Ward, which\r\n  states a jury could determine from circumstantial evidence whether a person was\r\n  visibly intoxicated such that a prudent man would have known of his condition.Â  Daley, 303 S.C. at 87, 399 S.E.2d at 16.Â  However, in each of the cases\r\n  cited by Hartfield, the sale or consumption of alcohol at the establishments in\r\n  question was either admitted to, or proven by other evidence.Â  We find\r\n  Hartfieldâ€™s lack of evidence as to the Pubâ€™s sale of alcohol fatal to his argument.\r\nMoreover, each of\r\n  the cases cited by Hartfield is factually distinguishable from the case at\r\n  hand.Â  In Daley, this court held that the circuit court erred in its\r\n  response to a jury question, because it removed from the province of the jury the\r\n  issue of whether circumstantial evidence could establish visible intoxication.Â  Daley, 303 S.C. at 87, 399 S.E.2d at 16.Â  However, the intoxicated\r\n  patron admitted that he drank nine beers in the five hours he was present in\r\n  the establishment.Â  Id. at 83, 399 S.E.2d at 14.Â  In addition, the\r\n  accident occurred only fifteen to twenty minutes after the patron left, and the\r\n  establishment was the only one which the patron frequented that evening.Â  Id.Â  In Alaniz, the Texas Court of Appeals found that the temporal proximity\r\n  between the patronâ€™s exit from the establishment, and a convenience store video\r\n  captured after the accident occurred, some fifty to fifty-five minutes after\r\n  the patron left, was too great.Â  Alaniz, 165 S.W.3d at 15. Â The Alaniz court noted that â€œalthough evidence of [patron]â€™s obvious intoxication and the\r\n  requisite proximate causation may be established by circumstantial evidence, the evidence must transcend mere suspicion and conjecture.â€Â  Alaniz,\r\n  165 S.W.3d at 14-15.Â  \r\nIn Romano,\r\n  the Court of Appeals in New York also found that circumstantial evidence was\r\n  admissible to prove intoxication; however, it expressly rejected as speculative\r\n  and conclusory, evidence such as the retrograde analysis in the case at hand,\r\n  because the academic conclusion of a personâ€™s level of toxicity, arrived at\r\n  after-the-fact, was not based on any facts or data contemporaneous to the sale\r\n  of the alcohol.Â  Romano, 684 N.E.2d at 22; see also Sorenson\r\n    v. Denny Nash, Inc., 671 N.Y.S.2d 559, 560-61 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998) (applying\r\n  the analysis in Romano).Â  Finally in Ladd, retrograde analysis\r\n  evidence was admitted as evidence of what the personâ€™s intoxication would have\r\n  been when the accident occurred, where the BAC test was not administered until\r\n  later; however, objections to this evidence were not properly preserved, so the Ladd court did not rule on its propriety.Â  Ladd, 675 N.E.2d at 1213.\r\nSection 61-4-580(2)\r\n  clearly states that an actual sale of alcohol to an intoxicated person\r\n  is prohibited.Â  (emphasis added).Â  Even taking the evidence at trial in the\r\n  light most favorable to Hartfield, as we are required to do on review of a\r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the record is simply devoid of any evidence that\r\n  the Pub actually sold Helton alcohol while he was there, or that Helton was drinking\r\n  while present.Â  As a result, we need not decide whether retrograde analysis\r\n  would be admissible in a proper case because, in the absence of evidence of a\r\n  sale, the directed verdict was properly granted.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Retrograde extrapolation begins with the known\r\n  variable of what a personâ€™s BAC is at the time of testing, and then\r\n  extrapolates that figure back, taking certain assumptions and known variables\r\n  into consideration, in order to create a drinking timeline as a rough estimate\r\n  of what the personâ€™s BAC would have been at any point during the day of\r\n  drinking.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4470","title":"State v.

time that you remember that [Kirton] touched your private parts?\r\n\tA:Â  When\r\n  we were living in the trailer, and me and him were laying on his bed watching\r\n  tv.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd, um,\r\n  whereâ€”how old were you?\r\n\tA:Â  Six\r\n  or seven.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tDo you\r\n  remember what grade you were in?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Second or third.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd, um,\r\n  where did he touch you?\r\n\tA:Â  He\r\n  just, like, touched my boobs and made me touch his penis.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd do\r\n  you remember if you had your clothes on or off?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  donâ€™t remember.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd what\r\n  about him?Â  Did he have his clothesâ€”his pants on?\r\n\tA:Â  He\r\n  had a pair of boxers on.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  did you touch his penis on the outside or the inside of his boxers?\r\n\tA:Â  The\r\n  inside.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd how\r\n  did that happen?Â  Did he pull his pants down or how didâ€”do you remember?\r\n\tA:Â  He\r\n  took my hand.\r\n\tQ:Â  Heâ€”\r\n\tA:Â  He\r\n  took my hand.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd he\r\n  did what with you hand?\r\n\tA:Â  He\r\n  pulled it into his boxers.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Inside his boxers?\r\n\tAnd is\r\n  that the only time anything like that ever happened to you?\r\n\tA:Â  No.\r\n\tQ:Â  Um,\r\n  so whenâ€”so this was six or seven years ago.Â  Is that right?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  you were about six years old?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â  Do\r\n  you remember about how many times that type of thing happened?\r\n\tA:Â  No,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tHow\r\n  often did it happen?\r\n\tA:Â  A\r\n  couple of times a month, I guess.\r\n\tQ:Â  And,\r\n  um, for the next few years up until, um, the last year or so, was it the thing\r\n  that happened a couple of times a month, was that all the same or was it\r\n  different?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  donâ€™t know.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tWhat\r\n  kind of things did he do to you a couple of times a month?\r\n\tA:Â  Just\r\n  making me touch his penis and he touched me.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tWhere\r\n  did he touch you?\r\n\tA:Â  On\r\n  my crotch and my boobs.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd, ah,\r\n  do you know when the first time was when he touched you in your crotch?\r\n\tA:Â  No,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Alright.\r\n\tDo you\r\n  remember about how long it was?\r\n\tA:Â  No,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â  Was\r\n  it more than a year ago or less than a year ago?\r\n\tA:Â  It\r\n  was probably more than a year ago.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  did he everâ€”what did he touch yourâ€”the first time he touched you in your\r\n  crotch, what didâ€”what did he touch you with?Â  What body part of his?\r\n\tA:Â  His\r\n  hand.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAndâ€”and\r\n  you say that was probably more than a year ago?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  then did he ever touch your crotch with any part of his body?\r\n\tLet me\r\n  ask you this.Â  You said it happened a couple of times a month.Â  Right?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  was there ever a time when he either didnâ€™t do it or didnâ€™t do it as much?\r\n\tA:Â  When\r\n  he first started dating Lisa.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tTell\r\n  meâ€”tell me what happened the last times.\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  donâ€™t remember the first one that well but the last time was two or three days\r\n  before Christmas, and I was laying on the couch because I had spent the night\r\n  with him, and he came in the living room and took my pants off andâ€”put his\r\n  penis in my crotch.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Whoâ€”where did that take place?\r\n\tA:Â  His\r\n  house in the living room.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  did you say you were on the couch?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â  I\r\n  said were youâ€”you were laying on the couch before he came in, and I was about\r\n  to ask the question.\r\n\tWhich\r\n  is, um, when he inserted his penis into your crotch, were youâ€”was he onâ€”how\r\n  were yâ€™all positioned on the couch?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  was laying down, and he was on his knees.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ:Â  How\r\n  does itâ€”how did that make you feel?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Upset.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  did you tell anybody right away after that?Â  Did you tell anybody right away\r\n  after that happened?\r\n\tA:Â  No,\r\n  not right away.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  why not?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  just didnâ€™t want anybody to know.\r\n\tQ:Â  Were\r\n  you embarrassed?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tWere you\r\n  afraid?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ:Â  Did\r\n  he say anything to you about what would happen if you told?\r\n\tA:Â  He\r\n  just told me if I told Iâ€™d never get to see him again.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\tAnd you\r\n  told your mom, and then after that, did you go to see a lady named Dr. Carol\r\n  Rahter?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  think so.\r\n\tQ:Â  Okay.\r\n\tAnd did\r\n  you tell her basically what happened?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â  When\r\n  [Kirton] put his penis in your crotch, did he put it inside your vagina?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  sir.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\r\nDr.\r\n  Carol Ann Rahter conducted a forensic interview with Victim on March 2, 2006.Â \r\n  The forensic interview consisted of a one-on-one conversation lasting\r\n  approximately thirty minutes followed by a medical examination.Â  Dr. Rahter\r\n  advised the purpose of a forensic interview of a child victim of sexual assault\r\n  is to determine what happened to the child to ascertain (1) what kind of\r\n  medical treatment is needed and (2) whether it is safe for the child to return\r\n  to his or her environment.Â  Dr. Rahter has conducted over a thousand forensic\r\n  interviews with child victims of sexual assault since 1993.Â  Dr. Rahter\r\n  asserted on direct examination:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  In\r\n  your opinion did [Victim] appear to be competent?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  she was competent.\r\n\tQ:Â  And,\r\n  um, what, if anything, did she relate to you about the time frame of the sexual\r\n  assault?\r\n\tA:Â  She\r\n  has difficulty with age because she told me that the first time it happened she\r\n  was seven, that that was either second grade, third grade or fourth grade.\r\n\tNow, we\r\n  all know that when youâ€™re about seven, youâ€™re aboutâ€”youâ€™re either in first\r\n  grade depending on your birthday or second grade.Â  Youâ€™re not in fourth grade.\r\n\tUm, so\r\n  that wasâ€”she has a little difficulty with time. \r\n\tThatâ€™s\r\n  when she said the first time happened.\r\n\tShe told\r\n  me that the last time happened approximately or aboutâ€”I think she used the word\r\n  â€œaboutâ€ four weekends before.\r\n\tAndâ€”\r\n\tQ:Â  What\r\n  is the concept of delayed reporting?Â  What does that mean?\r\n\tA:Â  The\r\n  majority of children do not report at the time of any kind of sexual abuse.Â \r\n  Thereâ€™s many reasons for that. . . .Â  \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tQ:Â  Now,\r\n  um, how does that impact the childâ€”the delayed reporting, how does that impact\r\n  the childâ€™s ability to be specific with respect to dates of the assault?\r\n\tA:Â  My\r\n  experience with children reporting dates is unless itâ€™s something that happened\r\n  on their birthday or Christmas or something thatâ€™s very impactual [sic] in a\r\n  childâ€™s life, they canâ€™t tell you the date.\r\n\tI mean,\r\n  Iâ€™ve got a teenager.Â  She canâ€™t tell you the date of anything.\r\n\tItâ€™s\r\n  just theyâ€™re not small adults.Â  Theyâ€™re children, and their time frames are not\r\n  the same as adults.Â  They donâ€™t write checks.Â  They donâ€™t knowâ€”write dates down\r\n  all the time, and so frequently children will tell me, â€œIt happened a lot of\r\n  times.â€\r\n\tAnd when\r\n  Iâ€™ll say to them, â€œDoes that mean less than five or more than five?â€\r\n\tTheyâ€™ll\r\n  say, â€œMore than five.â€\r\n\tBut they\r\n  canâ€™t tell me how many times.\r\n\tBut when\r\n  you go on and interview them, theyâ€™ll end up saying that it happened every\r\n  weekend over a three year period of time.\r\n\tWell,\r\n  then, obviously, thatâ€™s a lot more than five.\r\n\tThey\r\n  have a lot of difficulty quantitating [sic] and telling specifics about dates.\r\n\tThey can\r\n  tell nighttime and daytime.Â  They can sometimes tell you it was before\r\n  Christmas or after Christmas or, â€œIt was before my birthday or after my\r\n  birthday,â€ or it was in the summertime and school was not going on but they\r\n  have a lot of difficulty telling me a specific date, a specific month, specific\r\n  quantities of the timesâ€”of how many times something occurs to them.\r\n\tAlso,\r\n  when there is an extended period of time where children have been assaulted, a\r\n  lot of that blends together.Â  So sometimes theyâ€™ll report something that was\r\n  actually several different incidents as if it was all in one day, and so\r\n  sometimes it doesnâ€™tâ€”it just doesnâ€™t make logical sense the way theyâ€™re\r\n  reporting but thatâ€™s just what we see.Â  They blend things, and so itâ€™s\r\n  notâ€”sometimes it doesnâ€™t make logical sense with dating and reporting.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  as in the case of [Victim,] somebody a child has assaulted at the time that\r\n  youâ€™re sevenâ€”if they are seven until the time that they are twelve or thirteen,\r\n  um, how would that impact their ability to be specific with respect to the\r\n  nature of their assaults?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Well, the same thing.Â  When it happens multiple times, they tend to blendâ€”the\r\n  wayâ€”the things that they can tell oftentimes, like, if itâ€™s a different\r\n  location theyâ€™ll be able to tell different things that occurred to them\r\n  physically which is usually a grooming process, what starts out being something\r\n  thatâ€™s non-painful and ends up progressing to something thatâ€™s more, um, ah,\r\n  aggressive and oftentimes painful.Â  Over a period of time that occurs.\r\n\tSo they\r\n  can oftentimes tell you specific about when things transitioned, when different\r\n  acts started occurring to them, and oftentimes, they can tell you more specific\r\n  detail if it was something like it always happened in the house but one time it\r\n  happened in their car on the way to Wal-Mart.Â  \r\n\tBut when\r\n  the assaults are occurring in the same setting, theyâ€™re very blended together,\r\n  especially if it happens over a number of years.\r\n\tSo,\r\n  oftentimes, they might be saying something that happened when they were seven\r\n  and also blending it with something that happened when they were nine and then\r\n  something that happened when they were eleven because thatâ€™s just the way their\r\n  memories are of the sexual abuse.\r\n\tQ:Â  Did\r\n  you, ah, conduct a physical examination of [Victim]?\r\n\tA:Â  I\r\n  did.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â  With\r\n  the disclosure of children, ah, do they always fully disclose the first time\r\n  you talk to them?\r\n\tA:Â  It\r\n  is very rare to fully disclose the first time.Â  Kids disclose in a piece-meal\r\n  fashion, and the only time thereâ€™s a big exception to that is when itâ€™s a\r\n  one-time incident and they disclose right away.\r\n\tBut even\r\n  then some of the details donâ€™t come out right after that happens.Â  They may a\r\n  week later tell something else they remember, um, about what the guy was\r\n  wearing or what something looked like or whatever.\r\n\tSo, itâ€™s\r\n  very rare to get a full disclosure which is why we try to refer all these\r\n  children to counseling so that they can build a rapport with a counselor and\r\n  have ongoing counseling to not only work through these things but oftentimes\r\n  theyâ€™re able toâ€”theyâ€™re more comfortable in that setting when theyâ€™ve had\r\n  multiple sessions with somebody to disclose more.\r\n\tThis is\r\n  a forensic interview.Â  You see them one time.Â  You donâ€™t have a rapport that\r\n  youâ€™ve built up with them over a number of weeks or months.Â  \r\n\tSo it\r\n  would be very rare to get a full disclosure in the first interview.\r\n\tQ:Â  And\r\n  would it surprise if different details were given at different times to\r\n  different people?\r\n\tA:Â  No.\r\n\tQ:Â  Why\r\n  is that?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Because thatâ€™s what happens.Â  Thatâ€™s the norm.\r\n\tQ:Â  Does\r\n  that happen more often than not?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Correct.\r\n\tQ:Â  So,\r\n  ah, getting back to the physical exam, whenâ€”did you say when you conducted the\r\n  physical exam?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes,\r\n  right after the interview.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tQ:Â  What\r\n  were your findings?\r\n\tA: . . .\r\n\tIn her\r\n  case, her hymen was redundant and estrogenized meaning it was like the\r\n  scrunchy.Â  Estrogrenized means it was thickened, and there was a complete transection\r\n  noted at seven oâ€™clock.\r\n\tWe look\r\n  at the hymen like a clock.Â  Six oâ€™clock is down here.Â  Twelve oâ€™clock is up\r\n  here.\r\n\tSo at\r\n  seven oâ€™clock she had a complete transection of her hymen which was healed.Â \r\n  You know, it wasnâ€™t bleeding or anything at the time but, obviously, there had\r\n  been a penetrating injury there that had caused a transection to her hymen, and\r\n  when it healed, it did not heal back together.Â  So thereâ€™s a permanent transection\r\n  there at seven oâ€™clock.\r\n\tQ:Â  What\r\n  kind of object would cause that type of injury?\r\n\tA:Â  When\r\n  you see a transection, you donâ€™t know what object.Â  All you know is itâ€™s a\r\n  penetrating injury to the hymen.\r\n\tIt could\r\n  be a penis.Â  It could be a foreign object.Â  It could be digital penetration\r\n  with a finger.Â  You donâ€™t know by looking at the injury what caused the injury.\r\n\tQ:Â  Um,\r\n  so that doesnâ€™t differ in every case.Â  In every case itâ€™s not possible for you\r\n  to say who the perpetrator is.Â  Is that true?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Correct.\r\n\tQ:Â  You\r\n  can just say whether there is physical evidence to indicate penetration.Â  Is\r\n  that right?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Correct.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Would it be, ah, likely that the injury to the hymen was caused by the victim\r\n  herself?\r\n\tA:Â  No.\r\n\tQ:Â  Why\r\n  is that?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Because research and studies have shown that even in severely mentally retarded\r\n  children, they donâ€™t injure their own hymen, and the reason is because the\r\n  hymen is very sensitive in children, painful to touch.\r\n\tSo, and\r\n  even if all children masturbate even in extremely mentally retarded children,\r\n  they donâ€™t touch the hymen because when they touch it, it hurts, and they stop\r\n  touching it.Â  So they donâ€™t cause injury to their own hymen.\r\n\tUm, the\r\n  same thing with tampons donâ€™t cause injuries to hymens.\r\n\tInjuries\r\n  to hymen occur by something thatâ€™s forceful penetrating the hymen, and so you\r\n  donâ€™t get those injuries from self, ah, stimulation.Â  \r\n\tQ:Â  Were\r\n  your findings, ah, you saidâ€”you say your findings were diagnostic of sexual\r\n  assault?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  Yeah, the penetrating injury to the vagina.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  Thank you.\r\n\tAnd, ah,\r\n  wereâ€”were your medical findings consistent with the forensic interview that you\r\n  conducted with [Victim]?\r\n\tA:Â  Yes.\r\n\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Kirton was asked whether it would be â€œsickâ€ for an adult to have sex\r\n  with a child, and Kirton agreed.Â  The State then sought to introduce a\r\n  statement Kirton made at his bond hearing in which he indicated he needed\r\n  mental help.Â  The court held a Jackson v. Denno hearing in camera to determine whether to suppress the statement.\r\nGeorgetown County magistrate Benjamin Dunn testified that at Kirtonâ€™s bond hearing, he read him\r\n  his Miranda rights.Â  Judge Dunn confirmed he informed Kirton of his right to\r\n  remain silent and anything he said could be used against him.Â  Judge Dunn substantiated\r\n  he told Kirton he had a right to an attorney and if he could not afford an\r\n  attorney that one would be appointed for him.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  informing Kirton of his rights, Judge Dunn asked Kirton, â€œWould you like to\r\n  address the court?â€Â  Kirton responded, â€œI need help.â€Â  Judge Dunn inquired what\r\n  kind of help, and Kirton professed, â€œI need mental help.â€Â  Judge Dunn\r\n  acknowledged Kirton was in custody but asserted the purpose of the questioning\r\n  was solely as it related to setting bond and not seeking anything substantive\r\n  related to the charges against Kirton.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Kirton guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second\r\n  degree, and the court sentenced him to twelve years imprisonment.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Kirtonâ€™s motion to exclude evidence of prior bad acts?\r\n\tII.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Kirtonâ€™s motion to suppress a statement made during his bond hearing?\r\n\tIII.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in admitting\r\n  Dr. Rahterâ€™s testimony, which Kirton avers exceeded the parameters of time and\r\n  place?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v.

Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827,\r\n  829 (2001).\r\na.&nbsp; Clear and\r\n  Convincing Evidence\r\nâ€œWhen considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence\r\n  of other bad acts, this court is bound by the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings\r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.â€Â  State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 325,\r\n  580 S.E.2d 186, 189 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1,\r\n  6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)).Â  The determination of a witnessâ€™s credibility\r\n  is left to the trial judge who saw and heard the witness and is therefore in a\r\n  better position to evaluate his or her veracity.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at\r\n  325-326, 580 S.E.2d at 190 (citing State v. Rosier, 312 S.C. 145, 149,\r\n  439 S.E.2d 307, 310 (Ct. App. 1993)).\r\nVictim testified about the events that took place beginning at\r\n  approximately age seven.Â  While she could not remember details of the events\r\n  from six years prior, she specifically testified Kirton touched her breasts and\r\n  crotch and made her touch his penis.Â  She professed the abuse occurred several\r\n  times a month except when Kirton first started dating his girlfriend.Â  Testimony\r\n  in the record supports the finding made by the trial judge that there was clear\r\n  and convincing evidence of the prior bad acts, and that finding was not\r\n  erroneous.\r\nb.&nbsp; Common Scheme\r\n  or Plan\r\nâ€œA\r\n  close degree of similarity or connection between the prior bad act and the\r\n  crime for which the defendant is on trial is required to support admissibility\r\n  under the common scheme or plan exception.â€Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346\r\n  S.C. 526, 546, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001).Â  Prior bad act evidence is\r\n  admissible where the evidence is of such a close similarity to the charged\r\n  offense that the previous act enhances the probative value of the evidence so\r\n  as to outweigh the prejudicial effect.Â  State v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110,\r\n  114, 456 S.E.2d 390, 392 (1995).Â  The degree of remoteness between the other\r\n  crimes and the one charged is one factor to be considered in determining the\r\n  connection between them.Â  Id.Â  As the similarity becomes closer, the\r\n  more likely the evidence will be admissible.Â  State v. Aiken, 322 S.C.\r\n  177, 180, 470 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œThe acid test of admissibility\r\n  is the logical relevancy of the other crimes.â€Â  State v. Cutro, 332 S.C.\r\n  100, 103, 504 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1998); see also State v. Stokes,\r\n  279 S.C. 191, 304 S.E.2d 814 (1983) (finding common scheme or plan exception\r\n  requires more than mere commission of two similar crimes by the same person).Â  When\r\n  a criminal defendantâ€™s prior bad acts are directed toward the same victim and\r\n  are very similar in nature, those acts are admissible as a common scheme or\r\n  plan.Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. at 471, 523 S.E.2d at 792-793.Â  \r\nWe reviewed the history of jurisprudence addressing prior bad act\r\n  evidence in child sexual abuse cases in State v. Weaverling:\r\n\r\n\tIn State v. Richey, 88 S.C. 239, 70 S.E. 729 (1911), our\r\n  Supreme Court held admissible evidence that a man charged with carnal knowledge\r\n  of a girl under fourteen continued his illicit relationship with the child past\r\n  her fourteenth birthday. The court ruled â€œ â€˜acts prior and also subsequent to\r\n  the act charged in the indictment, when indicating a continuousness of illicit\r\n  intercourse, are admissible in evidence as showing the relation and mutual\r\n  disposition of the parties.â€™ â€Â  Id. at 242, 70 S.E. at 730. \r\n\tThe common scheme or plan exception â€œis\r\n  generally applied in cases involving sexual crimes, where evidence of acts\r\n  prior and subsequent to the act charged in the indictment is held admissible as\r\n  tending to show continued illicit intercourse between the same parties.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 265, 89 S.E.2d 701, 711 (1955).Â  Such evidence\r\n  is admissible when the â€œ â€˜close similarity of the charged offense and the\r\n  previous act[s] enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule\r\n  the prejudicial effect.â€™ â€Â  State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323\r\n  S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984).Â  In McClellan, the Court addressed the\r\n  admissibility of testimonial evidence of appellant's pattern of sexual attacks\r\n  against each of his three daughters in his trial for criminal sexual conduct\r\n  against the youngest daughter.Â  The Court allowed the youngest daughter to\r\n  testify the appellant had attacked her on previous occasions, even though the\r\n  appellant was not charged for the previous attacks.Â  The Court held the â€œprosecutrixâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding prior attacks was admissible under [the common scheme]\r\n  exception to show the continued illicit intercourse forced upon her by\r\n  Appellant.â€Â  Id. at 392, 323 S.E.2d at 774. \r\n\tAdditionally, the Court found the testimony\r\n  of the other daughters concerning prior misconduct was admissible.Â  The\r\n  experiences of each of the three daughters paralleled that of her sisters: the\r\n  initial attack occurred around the time each girl reached age twelve; appellant\r\n  entered their bedroom late at night and chose one of them who he would then\r\n  take to his bedroom where she would be forced to submit; he gave to each the same\r\n  explanation for his actionsâ€”that he was â€œteaching them how to be with their\r\n  husbandsâ€; and he quoted to each a specific Bible verse during the attacks.Â  \r\n\tId. at 391, 323 S.E.2d at 773.Â  The Court concluded the evidence fell squarely\r\n  within the common scheme or plan exception. \r\n\tLikewise, in State v. Hallman, 298\r\n  S.C. 172, 379 S.E.2d 115 (1989), our Supreme Court held the trial court did not\r\n  err in admitting evidence of appellantâ€™s sexual abuse of three of his former\r\n  foster daughters in his criminal sexual conduct trial for abuse of a fourth\r\n  foster daughter.Â  The challenged evidence included the testimony of two sisters\r\n  who were foster children in the Hallman home for five years.Â  Shortly after\r\n  they were placed in his care, appellant rubbed the girlsâ€™ bodies outside their\r\n  clothing.Â  He then began digital penetration and forced each girl to rub his\r\n  penis.Â  Another young woman testified that when she lived with appellant at the\r\n  age of four, he forced her to rub his penis on four occasions.Â  The charges\r\n  against the appellant included, but went beyond, the type of acts testified to\r\n  by the other young women.Â  Finding the evidence of the other acts admissible,\r\n  the Court explained the abuse against the victim â€œcommenced . . . in exactly\r\n  the same manner under similar circumstancesâ€ as the abuse of the other foster\r\n  children.Â  Id. at 175, 379 S.E.2d at 117.Â  The Court determined â€œthe\r\n  evidence of prior bad acts bears such a close similarity to the offense charged\r\n  in this case that its probative value clearly outweighs its prejudicial effect.â€Â  \r\n\tId. at 175, 379 S.E.2d at 117. \r\n\tThe appellant in State v. Blanton,\r\n  316 S.C. 31, 446 S.E.2d 438 (Ct. App. 1994), claimed the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting the testimony of two females in his trial for criminal sexual conduct\r\n  against his granddaughter.Â  He argued the alleged prior bad acts were not\r\n  closely similar to the charged offense.Â  In their testimony, the females\r\n  indicated they had been sexually molested by appellant at approximately the\r\n  same age and in the same manner as appellant's granddaughter.Â  The Court held: â€œIn\r\n  each instance, [appellant] took advantage of his relationship with the victim\r\n  for his sexual gratification. The prior acts were sufficiently similar to the\r\n  charged offense to be admissible.â€Â  Id. at 33, 446 S.E.2d at 439. \r\n\tMore recently, in State v. Adams,\r\n  332 S.C. 139, 504 S.E.2d 124 (Ct. App. 1998), the trial courtâ€™s admission of appellantâ€™s\r\n  stepdaughterâ€™s testimony, detailing eight years of extensive sexual abuse which\r\n  mirrored the charged allegations made by another stepdaughter, was upheld under\r\n  the common scheme or plan exception.Â  The appellant used his relationship as\r\n  stepfather to control both stepdaughters and engaged in similar conduct as to\r\n  each. The Court announced the specifics were so similar â€œthat proof of one\r\n  tended to prove the otherâ€ and the close similarity of the other bad act\r\n  evidence to the charged offense enhanced the probative value so that it\r\n  outweighed the prejudicial effect.Â  Id. at 143, 504 S.E.2d at 126. \r\n\r\nWeaverling, 337 S.C. at 469-471, 523 S.E.2d at 791-792.\r\nIn Weaverling, we analyzed a situation where Weaverling was\r\n  charged with performing fellatio on Doe on three occasions and providing Doe a\r\n  pornographic magazine to look at on one occasion.Â  EvidenceÂ  indicated: (1)\r\n  Weaverling initiated the sexual contact by pulling down Doeâ€™s pants or shorts;\r\n  (2) he obtained sexual gratification by having the child review pornography;\r\n  (3) beginning when Doe was seven or eight years old, almost every time they saw\r\n  one another, Weaverling would get Doe alone, pull down Doeâ€™s pants, and perform\r\n  oral sex on Doe; and (4) Weaverling would have Doe look at a pornographic magazine\r\n  or movie during the sexual assaults.Â  We elucidated:\r\n\r\n\tThe challenged testimonial evidence of Weaverlingâ€™s prior bad acts\r\n  shows the same illicit conduct with the same victim under similar circumstances\r\n  over a period of several years.Â  The probative value of the evidence regarding\r\n  Weaverlingâ€™s prior bad acts clearly outweighs the prejudicial effect of\r\n  admitting the evidence.Â  As the Court concluded in State v. McClellan,\r\n  283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984), â€œ[i]t would be difficult to\r\n  conceive of a common scheme or plan more within the plain meaning of the\r\n  exception than that presented by this evidence.â€\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  471, 523 S.E.2d at 792-793.\r\nIn State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003), we considered a case where Tutton was charged with sexual assault of two\r\n  sisters, twelve-year old Jane and thirteen-year old Mary.Â  Jane alleged Tutton\r\n  touched her buttocks and private parts, and she testified, â€œ[h]e stuck his\r\n  fingers inside of me.â€Â  Mary advanced that Tutton touched her buttocks and\r\n  private parts outside of the covers before she was able to move outside of\r\n  Tuttonâ€™s reach.Â  During direct examination, the State sought to elicit\r\n  testimony that Tutton had sexually assaulted Jane on another occasion several\r\n  years prior to the events in question.Â  She asserted that four or five years\r\n  prior to the trial, Tutton sexually assaulted her when she and Mary were\r\n  staying with Tutton because their parents were on vacation.Â  She declared that\r\n  Tutton forced her to lay down on her back and take off her panties.Â  Tutton\r\n  performed oral sex on her and forced her to perform oral sex on him.Â  She\r\n  professed Tutton threatened to tell her parents she was misbehaving if she\r\n  spoke of the incident, and she didnâ€™t tell anyone about the incident prior to\r\n  the investigation of Tuttonâ€™s current charges.\r\nThe trial court ruled the evidence was admissible under the common\r\n  scheme or plan exception to Lyle.Â  We enunciated:\r\n\r\n\tSex crimes may be unique in this respect because they commonly\r\n  involve the same victims engaged in repeated incidents occurring under very\r\n  similar circumstances.Â  The reason for the general admissibility of such\r\n  evidence under these circumstances is self evidentâ€”where there is a pattern of\r\n  continuous conduct shown, that pattern clearly supports the inference of the\r\n  existence of a common scheme or plan, thus bolstering the probability that the\r\n  charged act occurred in a similar fashion.\r\n\tHowever, Weaverling and McClellan do not lower the bar for admissibility under \r\n\tLyle simply because sexual\r\n  crimes are involved.Â  Regardless of the nature of the charges facing the\r\n  defendant, there must be evidence that the defendant employed a common scheme\r\n  or plan in the commission of the crimes.Â  Where there is a pattern of\r\n  continuous misconduct, as commonly found in sex crimes, that pattern supplies\r\n  the necessary connection to support the existence of a plan.Â  Presumably, this\r\n  is so because the same evidence that establishes the continuous nature of the\r\n  assaults will generally suffice to prove the existence of the common scheme or\r\n  plan as well.Â  In Weaverling and McClellan, the sheer volume of\r\n  repeated occurrences, together with the close similarities in the assaults,\r\n  evidenced a pattern of continuous illicit conduct. Accordingly, these cases\r\n  fall squarely within the plain meaning of common scheme or plan evidence.Â  McClellan,\r\n  283 S.C. at 392, 323 S.E.2d at 774 (stating it would be difficult to conceive\r\n  of evidence more within the common scheme or plan exception); Weaverling,\r\n  337 at 469, 523 S.E.2d at 791 (stating the pattern of sexual abuse represented\r\n  â€œquintessential common scheme or plan evidenceâ€).\r\n\r\nTutton, 354 S.C. at 328-329, 580 S.E.2d at 191.Â \r\n  We then examined the dissimilarities between the charges and the uncharged\r\n  prior bad acts.Â  We concluded:\r\n\r\n\tThe balancing of the similarities in cases\r\n  concerning the admission of common scheme or plan evidence is a difficult task.Â \r\n  While inferential leaps are at the heart of such decisions, we are compelled to\r\n  find that the similarities in this case are insufficient to support the\r\n  inference that Tutton employed a common scheme or plan to commit the assaults\r\n  alleged in this case.Â  As stated in Lyle, â€œif the court does not clearly\r\n  perceive the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the\r\n  crime charged, that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be given the\r\n  benefit of the doubt and the evidence should be rejected.â€Â  Lyle, 125\r\n  S.C. at 417, 118 S.E. at 807; see also State v. Henry, 313 S.C.\r\n  106, 432 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 1993) (cert. dismissed as improvidently\r\n    granted) (stating the defendant must be given the benefit of the doubt\r\n  regarding the introduction of common scheme testimony where the admissibility\r\n  was a close question).Â  Because we do not clearly perceive the required\r\n  connection, we hold the trial judge erred by admitting Janeâ€™s testimony about\r\n  the uncharged assault under the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle.\r\n\r\nTutton, 354 S.C. at 333-334, 580 S.E.2d at 194 (footnote\r\n  omitted).\r\nIn State v. Hubner, 362 S.C. 572, 608 S.E.2d 463 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005), cert. granted, Nov. 15, 2006, Hubner was charged with six acts of\r\n  committing a lewd act upon a child.Â  The victim met Hubner at age twelve when\r\n  she became involved in a church youth group where Hubner volunteered.Â  Hubnerâ€™s\r\n  actions toward her progressed for three years.Â  The victim became uncomfortable\r\n  around him and successfully avoided him for certain periods during the three\r\n  years.Â  The victim eventually informed her youth pastor about Hubnerâ€™s actions,\r\n  and charges were brought.\r\nAt trial, the State proffered the testimony of Rachel, a\r\n  thirty-two year old who voluntarily traveled from her home in Arizona to South Carolina.Â  She testified that she met Hubner when her family moved to Maine in 1981, just before her twelfth birthday.Â  Hubner lived three to four houses away\r\n  and became acquainted with Rachelâ€™s parents.Â  Rachel began to watch television\r\n  with Hubner and became his friend.Â  She would help him shovel his driveway and\r\n  baby-sat his children at his house.Â  \r\n\r\n\tRachel thought Hubner was nice to her.\r\n  Hubner began to give Rachel short hugs.Â  At some point, however, these hugs\r\n  became a kind where Hubner would touch her body in the wrong way.Â  He also\r\n  began to kiss Rachel on the neck, and cheek, and would French kiss her.Â  This\r\n  contact occurred at his house while Rachel was baby-sitting.Â  There came a time\r\n  when Hubner began to fondle Rachelâ€™s breasts and bottom through her clothing\r\n  and would tell Rachel she had a nice body.Â  On one occasion, Hubner came up\r\n  from behind Rachel, grabbed her chest, and â€œrub[bed] certain body parts.â€Â  In\r\n  another incident, Hubner removed Rachelâ€™s shirt, but not her bra, and just\r\n  stared at her.\r\n\tHubner also would put his hands in her\r\n  front and back pockets and would massage her vagina and her buttocks through\r\n  her clothes.Â  This progressed until he would also touch her vaginal area under\r\n  her clothes.Â  Hubner would also come up behind her while he had an erection and\r\n  rub himself against her.Â  On other occasions, she touched his crotch both with\r\n  and without his clothes on.Â  This behavior progressed to him masturbating in\r\n  front of Rachel and having sexual intercourse with her.Â  Hubner also gave her\r\n  alcohol. Rachel testified Hubner would tell her she was pretty, she had a\r\n  beautiful body, and that he loved her.Â  He threatened to kill her if she ever\r\n  told anyone.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tDuring the hearing, Hubner took the stand\r\n  and admitted pleading guilty to one count of unlawful sexual contact against\r\n  Rachel, but denied he committed any of the acts Rachel claimed he committed.Â  After\r\n  hearing the testimony and arguments, the trial judge noted that the progression\r\n  of the seriousness of the acts over a period of time was different between the\r\n  two cases and there were â€œa number of acts that were very dissimilar.â€Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  the judge found the similar acts were probative, and their probative value\r\n  outweighed their prejudicial effect.Â  He thus determined it was proper to admit\r\n  the portions of Rachelâ€™s testimony regarding the similar acts, but the State\r\n  was not allowed to go into dissimilar acts.Â  The case proceeded to trial, and\r\n  Rachelâ€™s testimony regarding the hugging, kissing and inappropriate touching\r\n  was allowed into evidence over Hubnerâ€™s objection.Â  Thereafter, Hubner was\r\n  found guilty on all charges and was sentenced to three consecutive twelve-year\r\n  terms, two concurrent twelve-year terms, and one fifteen-year term, which was\r\n  suspended with five years of probation.\r\n\r\nId., 362 S.C. at 580-581, 608 S.E.2d at 467.Â \r\n  We reversed, instructing:\r\n\r\n\tIn the case at hand, the acts were against\r\n  two different victims and occurred some fourteen years apart.Â  Thus, the\r\n  testimony cannot be admitted on a generalized basis as a pattern of continuous\r\n  illicit conduct under the common scheme or plan exception.Â  Rather, the\r\n  admissibility of Rachelâ€™s testimony rests solely on whether the requisite\r\n  degree of similarity between the separate acts is present.Â  As noted, this\r\n  similarity must not merely be a similarity in the results.Â  Rather, there must\r\n  be such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are normally to\r\n  be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual\r\n  manifestations.\r\n\tThe trial judge here recognized the\r\n  numerous dissimilarities in the two cases.Â  He nonetheless allowed into\r\n  evidence prior bad acts against Rachel, attempting to limit the impact of these\r\n  dissimilarities by restricting the examination of Rachel to testimony\r\n  concerning only similar acts.Â  The evidence was thus presented in a vacuum to\r\n  the jury.Â  However, this does not diminish the fact that an overwhelming number\r\n  of significant dissimilarities were present between the prior bad act and the\r\n  case at hand.Â  While the similarities may â€œlink the two crimes,â€ the question\r\n  is whether they â€œpaint the broader, more relevant pictureâ€ of a common scheme\r\n  or plan of which they are the individual manifestations.Â  Tutton, 354\r\n  S.C. at 331, 580 S.E.2d at 192-93.Â  Thus, the trial judge failed to balance the\r\n  similarities and dissimilarities in making a determination as to whether Rachelâ€™s\r\n  testimony concerning the prior bad acts was admissible at all.\r\n\r\nId., 362 S.C. at 584-585, 608 S.E.2d at 469.\r\nIn State v. Wallace, 364 S.C. 130, 611 S.E.2d 332 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005), cert. granted, Nov. 14, 2006, Wallace was convicted of second\r\n  degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  The victim accused Wallace of â€œpush[ing]\r\n  his hands up [her] privates.â€Â  The trial court admitted testimony from victimâ€™s\r\n  sister that on prior occasions, Wallace performed oral sex, digital\r\n  penetration, and sexual intercourse on her.Â  We reversed, determining:\r\n\r\n\tIn this case, the trial court did not\r\n  address any connection between the two crimes to establish if the allegations\r\n  by the victimâ€™s sister were admissible.Â  The court instead ruled, â€œit goes to a\r\n  common scheme or plan because of the close degree of similarity between the\r\n  conduct, with regards to the two victims.â€Â  When the State was asked to explain\r\n  why the testimony was essential to its case, the solicitor responded:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThis is technically a credibility case, thatâ€™s what it is.Â  Itâ€™s\r\n  one witness's word against potentially another witnessâ€™s word.Â  The evidence\r\n  would be relevant and would be essential to the Stateâ€™s case because it is a\r\n  piece of evidence, just like any other piece of evidence, that goes to prove or\r\n  disprove the case.Â  And this is strictly a credibility case: Therefore, this\r\n  testimony is necessary to, again, prove the victimâ€™s allegations.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis argument could be used to admit testimony of any prior crime\r\n  when a defendant is accused of a subsequent but similar crime.Â  It falls far\r\n  short of the threshold for the admission of a prior crime under the common\r\n  scheme or plan exception to Lyle. Accordingly, the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting the evidence on this basis.\r\n\tIt was also error for the trial judge to\r\n  attempt to limit the testimony of the sister so that there would be a close\r\n  similarity between the prior bad act and the crime charged.Â  The court noted\r\n  that the testimony of the sister was more egregious than that of the victim and\r\n  ordered the testimony redacted, stating, â€œI find it appropriate under State\r\n    v. Tutton to limit the testimony of the Lyle witness only to the extent and\r\n  only to the acts which occurred to the victim in this prosecution, and not to\r\n  go beyond that, which will limit the prejudicial effect of this testimony\r\n  coming in.â€Â  This court in Tutton concluded the differences in the\r\n  evidence proffered of the prior criminal sexual conduct was sufficiently\r\n  different to render it inadmissible.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 333, 580\r\n  S.E.2d at 194.Â  We did not, however, sanction the redaction of testimony in\r\n  order to make similar that which is dissimilar.\r\n\r\nWallace, 364 S.C. at 141, 611 S.E.2d at 338.\r\nThe case at bar is formed out of the same mold as Weaverling and McClellan.Â  All of Kirtonâ€™s alleged activity was directed toward the\r\n  same victim.Â  The six to seven year pattern of escalating abuse of Victim by\r\n  Kirton is the essence of grooming and continuous illicit activity.Â  Kirton\r\n  began by rubbing the minor victimâ€™s breasts, proceeded to make her touch his\r\n  penis, began touching her vagina as she got older, and finally culminated the\r\n  sexual abuse by engaging in the intercourse for which he was charged.Â  The\r\n  prior sexual acts did not take place just once or twice, six or seven years\r\n  ago.Â  Victim indicated they happened several times a month for years.Â  While\r\n  the prior sexual acts are not the same as the exact crime for which Kirton was\r\n  charged, Victim detailed a clear pattern of escalating sexual abuse and not a\r\n  few isolated, unrelated incidents.\r\nKirtonâ€™s prior abuse of the minor victim was clearly â€œpart of an\r\n  overall plan or scheme devised by him to perpetuate the type of misconduct that\r\n  occurred.â€Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 330, 580 S.E.2d at 192.Â  The probative\r\n  value of the evidence was so great that it substantially outweighed the danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.Â  The\r\n  trial court properly found the evidence was admissible to show a common scheme\r\n  or plan, and Kirtonâ€™s continuous illicit conduct toward Victim was extremely\r\n  probative to prove the charged criminal sexual conduct occurred.Â  \r\nc.&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nWhether\r\n  an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  In\r\n    re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 63, 584 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2003); Taylor, 333\r\n  S.C. at 172, 508 S.E.2d at 876; State v.

App. 2003).Â  â€œNo definite rule of law governs this\r\n  finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be\r\n  determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€Â  Mitchell, 286\r\n  S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151.\r\nError\r\n  is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the\r\n  trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897; Mitchell,\r\n  286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 610,\r\n  486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set\r\n  aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State\r\n    v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380-381, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error\r\n  not affecting the result of the trial is harmless when guilt has been\r\n  conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational\r\n  conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d\r\n  581, 584 (1989).Â  The admission of improper evidence is harmless where the\r\n  evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.Â  State v. Blackburn,\r\n  271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978); State v. Weaverling, 337\r\n  S.C. 460, 471, 523 S.E.2d 787, 793 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v.\r\n    Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 463, 469 S.E.2d 49, 54 (1996) (instructing that\r\n  error in admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other\r\n  evidence which is properly admitted).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Victim, Dr. Rahter, and Victimâ€™s friend all testified regarding Kirtonâ€™s\r\n  touching Victim prior to the forcible intercourse for which he was charged.Â \r\n  While the objection to the testimony presented by Victim was preserved, Kirton\r\n  did not timely object to the testimony by the Victimâ€™s friend or Dr. Rahter.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the admission of Victimâ€™s testimony would have been harmless error\r\n  because it was merely cumulative to her friendâ€™s testimony and Dr. Rahterâ€™s\r\n  testimony that was entered into evidence without a contemporaneous objection.Â  See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003) (recognizing admission\r\n  of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to\r\n  other evidence); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993)\r\n  (finding any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to\r\n  evidence is harmless); State v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 498, 381 S.E.2d\r\n  732, 733 (1989) (instructing admission of improper evidence is harmless where\r\n  it is merely cumulative to other evidence); Broaddus, 361 S.C. at 542,\r\n  605 S.E.2d at 583-84 (concluding error in admission of drug evidence was\r\n  harmless where it was cumulative to other unobjected-to testimony at trial\r\n  regarding drug use and drug dealing); State v. Richardson, 358 S.C. 586,\r\n  596-97, 595 S.E.2d 858, 863 (Ct. App. 2004) (observing even if the challenged\r\n  testimony constituted improper â€œcharacter evidence,â€ any error in its admission\r\n  was harmless where the testimony was cumulative to other similar testimony that\r\n  was admitted without objection); see also State v. Brown, 344\r\n  S.C. 70, 75, 543 S.E.2d 552, 555 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding any error in\r\n  admitting evidence of murder defendantâ€™s violent character was harmless as\r\n  properly admitted evidence of the defendantâ€™s use of force during his argument\r\n  with victim the previous day clearly demonstrated defendantâ€™s propensity to\r\n  become violent).\r\nAssuming, arguendo, that the trial judge did err in admitting Victimâ€™s testimony,\r\n  such error was harmless.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; bond hearing statement\r\nKirton posits the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a statement made during\r\n  his bond hearing.Â  We disagree\r\nThe\r\n  trial courtâ€™s determination of whether a defendant was deprived of his Miranda rights will be upheld unless unsupported by the record.Â  See State v.\r\n    Navy, 370 S.C. 398, 405, 635 S.E.2d 549, 553 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œAppellate\r\n  review of whether person is in custody for Miranda purposes is limited to a\r\n  determination of whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by the record.â€)\r\nIn Miranda\r\n  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the United States Supreme Court held the\r\n  Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prohibits admitting\r\n  statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, given by a suspect during\r\n  â€œcustodial interrogationâ€ without following prescribed procedural safeguards.Â  Id. at 444.Â  Custodial interrogation means â€œquestioning initiated by law enforcement\r\n  officers after a person has been taken into custody.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe warning\r\n  mandated by Miranda was meant to preserve the privilege during â€˜incommunicado\r\n  interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.â€™ â€Â  Illinois\r\n    v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 296 (1990) (quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 445).\r\na.&nbsp; Custodial\r\n  Interrogation\r\nIn the case sub judice, Kirton was not subjected to\r\n  custodial interrogation at his bond hearing, even though he was in custody at\r\n  the time.Â  There is no evidence that he was subjected to questioning by law\r\n  enforcement or any other interrogation such that the requirement to provide Miranda warnings attached.\r\nâ€œInterrogation is either express questioning or its functional\r\n  equivalent. It includes words or actions on the part of police (other than\r\n  those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are\r\n  reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.â€Â  State v. Kennedy,\r\n  325 S.C. 295, 303, 479 S.E.2d 838, 842 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified,\r\n  333 S.C. 426, 510 S.E.2d 714 (1998) (citing Rhode Island v. Innis, 446\r\n  U.S. 291 (1980); State v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 382 S.E.2d 911 (1989)).\r\n\r\n\tThe Miranda decision is meant to preserve the privilege\r\n  against self-incrimination during interrogation of a suspect in a police\r\n  dominated atmosphere. The police dominated atmosphere generates â€œinherently\r\n  compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist\r\n  and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Lynch, 375 S.C. 628, 635, 654 S.E.2d 292, 296\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. at 296).\r\nNot all encounters with law enforcement require Miranda warnings to be given.Â  Requiring a suspect to perform field sobriety tests\r\n  during a traffic stop does not constitute detainment sufficient to rise to the\r\n  level of â€œcustodial interrogation.â€Â  State v. Peele, 298 S.C. 63, 66,\r\n  378 S.E.2d 254, 256 (1989).Â  \r\nIn discussing the difference between Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  counsel and the Fifth Amendment right as memorialized in Miranda, the\r\n  United States Supreme Court has held a suspectâ€™s Miranda rights are only\r\n  invoked by â€œsome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression\r\n  of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial\r\n  interrogation by the police.Â  Requesting the assistance of an attorney at a\r\n  bail hearing does not bear that construction.â€Â  McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501\r\n  U.S. 171, 179 (1991) (emphasis removed).Â  The Court in McNeil found a\r\n  bail hearing is not a setting in which custodial interrogation takes place\r\n  requiring Miranda warnings.Â  The Illinois Supreme Court recognized:\r\n\r\n\tIt is not surprising that virtually every Supreme Court opinion\r\n  involving Miranda has used the phrase â€œcustodial interrogation.â€Â  It is\r\n  custodial interrogation with which Miranda was concerned.Â  . . .Â  While in\r\n  court on a bond hearing, a defendant is not subject to interrogation, and the\r\n  need for Miranda is not yet present.Â  . . .Â  Absent the interplay of custody\r\n  and interrogation, an individualâ€™s privilege against self-incrimination is not\r\n  threatened.\r\n\r\nPeople v.\r\n  Villalobos, 737 N.E.2d\r\n  639, 645 (Ill. 2000).Â  \r\nThe Maryland Court of Appeals dealt with a remarkably similar case\r\n  in Fenner v. State, 846 A.2d 1020 (Md. 2004).Â  At Fennerâ€™s bail hearing,\r\n  he was asked, â€œIs there anything youâ€™d like to tell me about yourself, sir?â€Â  Id. at 1023.Â  During the colloquy that followed, statements were made which the\r\n  State sought to admit at his trial.Â  Fenner sought to suppress the statements\r\n  because he was not given his Miranda warnings.Â  The court held that Miranda warnings were not required because Fenner was not subject to custodial\r\n  interrogation.Â  Specifically, the court reasoned â€œany questions asked of an\r\n  arrestee at a bail hearing should normally be general and unrelated to evidence\r\n  gathering or prosecution.â€Â  Id. at 1028.Â  The court announced:\r\n\r\n\tWe hold that nothing in the setting of petitionerâ€™s January 10,\r\n  2001 bail review hearing can be said to have coerced him into making his\r\n  inculpatory statement.Â  The question posed, â€œIs there anything you'd like to\r\n  tell me about yourself, sir?,â€ was a routine question to ask in a setting such\r\n  as a bail review hearing.Â  Questions posed to an arrestee by a judge regarding\r\n  matters relevant to bail, asked in the setting of a bail review hearing, do not\r\n  normally amount to an â€œinterrogationâ€ requiring that the arrestee be again\r\n  advised of his Miranda rights in order that his responses may be later\r\n  admitted into evidence at his merits trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 1030 (footnote omitted). \r\nKirton was not questioned by law enforcement or anyone associated\r\n  with law enforcement.Â  He was asked a single question by a magistrate presiding\r\n  over his bond hearing.Â  The innocuous question related solely to the setting of\r\n  the bond and in no way was intended to elicit an incriminating response.Â  There\r\n  was no requirement that Kirton be advised of his Miranda rights and no\r\n  requirement that a waiver of those rights be obtained.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in admitting into evidence Kirtonâ€™s voluntary statement made at his bond\r\n  hearing.\r\nb.&nbsp; Miranda\r\n  Warnings and Voluntary Waiver\r\nKirton contends he was not properly advised of his Miranda rights\r\n  and, even if he was advised, the State failed to demonstrate he voluntarily waived\r\n  his rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe well-known Miranda rights are that the accused must be\r\n  informed of: the right to remain silent; any statement made may be used as\r\n  evidence against him or her; and the right to the presence of an attorney.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Lynch, 375 S.C. 628, 633 n.5, 654 S.E.2d 292, 295 n.5 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (citing State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 303, 479 S.E.2d 838, 842 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 333 S.C. 426, 510 S.E.2d 714 (1998)).\r\nDuring the in camera hearing, Judge Dunn testified, â€œWhen\r\n  he came in, I advised him that this was his bond hearing; not his trial.Â  And I\r\n  read him his rights.â€Â  Judge Dunn elaborated about the rights he explained to\r\n  Kirton: â€œadvised him that he has the right to remain silent; and anything that\r\n  he says can be held against him [in] a court of law. . . .Â  And I asked himâ€”I\r\n  said: Do you understand that?â€Â  According to Judge Dunn, Kirton answered that\r\n  he did.Â  The trial court asked Judge Dunn, â€œDo you as a common course . . .\r\n  advise defendants of their right to have an attorney; and that if they cannot\r\n  afford an attorney . . . to contact the Public Defenderâ€™s Office?â€Â  Judge Dunn\r\n  responded, â€œYes sir.â€\r\nThe State introduced the Magistrateâ€™s Bond Hearing Checklist,\r\n  which indicated a check mark beside â€œDefendant was advised of his right to\r\n  counselâ€”to an appointed counsel if financial unable.â€Â  It was only after\r\n  advising Kirton of his rights and going through the checklist that Judge Dunn\r\n  asked Kirton if there was anything he wanted to say to the court.Â  At the in\r\n    camera hearing, Kirton testified that Judge Dunn went down the checklist\r\n  and â€œ[h]e read me rights . . . and then set my bond.â€Â  The evidence in the\r\n  record amply supports a finding that Kirton was properly advised of his Miranda rights and given the opportunity to waive them.\r\nThere is no indication Kirton was under the influence of drugs or\r\n  alcohol.Â  There is no evidence Kirton was coerced into making a statement, was promised\r\n  anything in exchange for his statement, or made his statement by anything other\r\n  than his own volition.Â  Judge Dunnâ€™s testimony supports the conclusion that\r\n  Kirton voluntarily waived his rights and freely made his statement to the\r\n  magistrate.Â  The trial courtâ€™s admission of Kirtonâ€™s statement did not\r\n  constitute error.\r\nIII.&nbsp; time and place evidence \r\n\r\nKirton\r\n  avers the trial court erred in allowing testimony by the Stateâ€™s expert\r\n  witness, Dr. Carol Rahter, that went beyond the corroborative testimony allowed\r\n  by Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE.Â  Rule 801(d)(1)(D) states, â€œA statement is not\r\n  hearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is\r\n  subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (D)\r\n  consistent with the declarantâ€™s testimony in a criminal sexual conduct case or\r\n  attempted criminal sexual conduct case where the declarant is the alleged\r\n  victim and the statement is limited to the time and place of the incident.â€\r\na.&nbsp; Preservation\r\nThe\r\n  issue Kirton raises is not properly preserved for review on appeal.Â  Kirton\r\n  relies on a motion made prior to trial to allege the issues are properly\r\n  preserved for review on appeal.Â  Prior to trial, Kirtonâ€™s counsel stated, â€œI\r\n  have one motion that the Court caution the State that any corroboration of\r\n  [Victimâ€™s] allegation of sexual abuse be strictly limited to time and place, and\r\n  I would impose that on each of the testifying witnesses and also to Dr. Rahter\r\n  as she testified also.â€Â  The court did not consider the motion to be a motion in\r\n    limine, but as a motion â€œto simply be sure that the witnesses do not come\r\n  in and without an understanding.â€Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\n\tI would\r\n  expect that if questions come up which defense counsel feels are proper\r\n  questions and you feel are improper questions, you will interpose an\r\n  appropriate objection, and likewise, if questions are asked that you feel are\r\n  proper and defense counsel feels are improper, . . . he will impose proper\r\n  objections.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  ruling by the court prior to trial was not a final ruling and the court\r\n  expected counsel to offer a contemporaneous objection if allegedly improper\r\n  testimony is offered.Â  Significant testimony occurred between the pre-trial\r\n  motion and Dr. Rahterâ€™s testimony that is challenged.Â  The pre-trial motion,\r\n  therefore, did not act to preserve the issue for review on appeal.Â  See State\r\n    v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642-43, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001) (finding\r\n  only when no evidence is taken between the trial courtâ€™s in limine ruling and the admission at trial of the evidence is the issue preserved\r\n  without a contemporaneous objection). \r\nKirton\r\n  alleges the objections were entered into the record by counsel.Â  Kirton points\r\n  to two instances where Dr. Rahterâ€™s testimony included allegedly improper\r\n  hearsay testimony beyond that which is allowed by Rule 801(d)(1)(D).Â  The first\r\n  instance is when Dr. Rahter was testifying regarding the beginning of the\r\n  sexual abuse Victim suffered.Â  Dr. Rahter stated she was told by Victim that\r\n  the first time the abuse occurred was when Victim was seven and the last time\r\n  was about four weekends before their interview.Â  No contemporaneous objection was\r\n  made when Dr. Rahter testified about the abuse.Â  See State v. Johnson,\r\n  363 S.C. 53, 58-59, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (â€œTo preserve an issue for\r\n  review there must be a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court. . . .Â  If a party fails to properly object, the party is\r\n  procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal.â€).\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Rahter testified regarding whether the medical findingsâ€”that Victimâ€™s hymen\r\n  had been transected by a â€œpenetrating injuryâ€â€”and Victimâ€™s testimony were consistent,\r\n  Kirton failed to object on any grounds.Â  Kirton directs this Court to an\r\n  exchange with the trial court after Dr. Rahterâ€™s testimony and counselâ€™s objection\r\n  after the presentation of Kirtonâ€™s case before he rested.Â  Neither of these\r\n  objections was contemporaneous to Dr. Rahterâ€™s testimony.Â  Kirtonâ€™s counsel\r\n  even admitted to the trial court: â€œI know I did not contemporaneously object\r\n  when she answered that but the Court prior to that made its ruling, and Iâ€™m\r\n  going to see if I can preserve it by putting the sidebar on.â€Â  \r\nb.&nbsp; Cumulative\r\nEven\r\n  if properly preserved, the allegedly improper testimony is cumulative to other\r\n  un-objected to testimony.Â  Several other witnesses testified regarding Victimâ€™s\r\n  statements about abuse by Kirton.Â  The other witnessesâ€™ testimony identifies\r\n  Kirton as the perpetrator and provides some details of the abuse.Â  See State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993) (stating\r\n  that any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to\r\n  evidence is harmless); State v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 499, 381 S.E.2d\r\n  732, 733 (1989) (â€œThe admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is\r\n  merely cumulative to other evidence.â€).\r\nc.&nbsp; Not Improper Testimony\r\nThe\r\n  testimony by Dr. Rahter was not improper hearsay testimony.Â  The first instance\r\n  alleged in Kirtonâ€™s brief included only the date or time frame of the alleged\r\n  abuse.Â  This testimony is properly allowed under Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  second instance involved testimony regarding the medical findings by Dr.\r\n  Rahter.Â  This testimony was properly admitted as evidence used by the expert\r\n  witness in forming her opinion that the medical findings were consistent with\r\n  the interview conducted with Victim.Â  Dr. Rahter explained why the statements\r\n  and medical findings were significant.Â  The testimony was admitted as forming\r\n  the base of her opinion and not for the truth of the matter asserted.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Howle v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 288 S.C. 586, 595-596, 344 S.E.2d\r\n  157, 162 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  issue raised in Kirtonâ€™s brief is not properly preserved for review on appeal,\r\n  the testimony was cumulative to other unobjected-to testimony, and the\r\n  testimony was not improper hearsay.Â  The trial court did not err in admitting\r\n  the testimony.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the trial court properly denied Kirtonâ€™s motion to exclude evidence of\r\n  prior bad acts.Â  Notwithstanding that Kirtonâ€™s appearance before a magistrate\r\n  at his bond hearing did not require Miranda warnings, Kirton was given\r\n  the Miranda warnings and voluntarily waived his rights by stating he\r\n  needed â€œmental help.â€Â  The trial courtâ€™s admission of this statement was not in\r\n  error.Â  Despite Kirtonâ€™s failure to preserve any objection to Dr. Rahterâ€™s\r\n  testimony, her testimony was proper and cumulative to other unobjected-to\r\n  evidence.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in admitting her testimony.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Kirtonâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4471","title":"Coker v.

Green, Annette Green, Jeanette Green, and Annie Harriot Green.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:Â  In this\r\n  boundary dispute case, James Coker appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s grant of\r\n  summary judgment in Respondentsâ€™ favor finding Coker had acquiesced to the\r\n  boundary lines.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  1985, Mott Fogle conveyed Lot 24 in the Smithville subdivision near Mount Pleasant to Jessie and Evelyn Gregg.Â  However, in 1987 the Greggs conveyed the lot\r\n  back to Fogle.Â  In 1999, Fogle filed a suit regarding the boundary issue, which\r\n  he later withdrew.Â  In 2002, Coker purchased Lot 24 from Fogle.Â Â  At the time\r\n  Coker entered the contract to purchase the lot, he was unaware of a discrepancy\r\n  between the boundaries as described on certain plats of the property and where\r\n  the boundaries were physically located.Â  In actuality, the lot contained\r\n  less land than the plats depicted.Â  Coker learned of the discrepancy in 1999\r\n  when he had a survey of the property performed in contemplation of the closing.\r\nIn 2003, Coker\r\n  brought suit against Catherine Cummings, who owns Lots 25 and 26, and Ida Dell, Jerome L., Annette, Jeanette, and\r\n  Annie Harriot Green, who own Lots 21, 22,\r\n  and 23, seeking a declaratory judgment on the boundary line dispute.Â  In 2004,\r\n  Coker added Agnes and Clayton\r\n  L. Oree and Thomas and Fred Snype, as\r\n  defendants.Â  In 2006, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The\r\n  parties stipulated that the Orees and Snypes should be dismissed from the\r\n  action.\r\nThe\r\n  Greens purchased some of their property but the rest they obtained by an\r\n  adverse possession action in 1986.Â  Annie Green presented an affidavit stating\r\n  she had cleared the property on lots 21, 22, and 23 in 1952 or 1953, began\r\n  cultivating a garden, and no one had challenged or complained about the\r\n  boundaries of her familyâ€™s lots.Â  However, the Greensâ€™ counsel did admit â€œthe\r\n  plants do not go up exactly to where they claim theâ€ boundary is located.Â \r\n  Greenâ€™s affidavit also stated that â€œin 1986 or 1987, Mr. Gregg attempted to\r\n  come on to my famil[yâ€™s] lots, however, I instructed him as to the boundaries\r\n  and asked that he move off the property, which he did.â€Â  Additionally, she provided,\r\n  â€œNo one since Mr. Gregg has questioned the boundaries of the lots until the\r\n  current dispute with Mr. Coker arose.â€\r\nCummings\r\n  submitted an affidavit stating Lot 25 had been in her family since 1913 and her\r\n  husband purchased Lot 26 in 1975.Â  Further, she stated her son installed a home\r\n  on Lot 25 in 1975 and has lived there permanently and without interruption\r\n  since the mid-1970s.Â  Additionally, she asserted â€œ[f]or over 20 years, no one\r\n  has complained about the location of his home or the location of the eastern\r\n  boundary (which is approximately 50 feet behind the home).â€Â  Cummings also\r\n  provided, â€œWe had the land surveyed many years ago.Â  The existing eastern\r\n  boundary of Lot 25 is clearly marked with iron property stakes.Â  Those stakes .\r\n  . . are approximately 50 feet behind [my sonâ€™s] house.â€\r\nCoker\r\n  also submitted an affidavit from a title examiner giving the title history for\r\n  the lots implicated in the action.Â  The affidavit asserted the Huguenin plat,\r\n  prepared in 1870, and the Weston plat, prepared in 1951, depicted all the lots involved\r\n  in the dispute to be approximately the same size and dimensions.Â  Ben Coker,\r\n  Cokerâ€™s brother, stated in his deposition that Ms. Green informed his crew they\r\n  were on her property when they went to perform a survey prior to Cokerâ€™s\r\n  purchase.Â  Ben Coker testified the distances depicted on the Weston plat do not\r\n  agree with the field distance.\r\nThe\r\n  master granted the defendants summary judgment in a form order filed October\r\n  27, 2006.Â  On December 8, 2006, the master entered a longer order, which Coker\r\n  asserts the master instructed the Greensâ€™ attorney to draft at the hearing.Â \r\n  The order provided Coker had â€œnot countered the considerable proof presented by\r\n  the defendants and there is no genuine issue of material fact.â€Â  The master\r\n  determined â€œall defendants have occupied their respective properties up to the\r\n  de facto boundary lines (as shown on the Seabrook survey) by acquiescence,\r\n  which the plaintiffâ€™s grantor and predecessors have recognized without contest\r\n  for a long period of time in excess of ten years.â€Â  (citing Knox v. Bogan,\r\n  322 S.C. 64, 71-72, 472 S.E.2d 43, 48 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œIt is well settled that\r\n  if adjoining landowners occupy their respective premises up to a certain line\r\n  which they mutually recognize and acquiesce in for a long period of time â€“\r\n  usually the time prescribed by the statute of limitations â€“ they are precluded\r\n  from claiming that the boundary line thus recognized and acquiesced in is not\r\n  the true one.â€)).Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.[1]Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to\r\n  expedite the disposition of cases not requiring the services of a fact\r\n  finder.&nbsp; George v.

[T]he time to file a notice of appeal pursuant to Rule\r\n  203(b), SCACR, begins to run when written notice that the order has been\r\n  entered into the record by the clerk of court has been received.â€Â  Upchurch\r\n    v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 24, 624 S.E.2d 643, 647&nbsp;(2006).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  notice of appeal in a case appealed from the Court of Common Pleas must be\r\n  served on all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written notice of\r\n  entry of the order or judgment.Â  The requirement of service of the notice of\r\n  appeal is jurisdictional, i.e., if a party misses the deadline, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction\r\n  to consider the appeal and has no authority or discretion to â€œrescueâ€ the\r\n  delinquent party by extending or ignoring the deadline for service of the\r\n  notice.Â  \r\n\r\nElam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n  Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 14-15, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 772, 775&nbsp;(2004) (citations omitted).\r\nIn Leviner\r\n  v. Sonoco Products Co.,&nbsp;339 S.C. 492, 493, 530 S.E.2d 127,\r\n  127-28&nbsp;(2000), the trial court filed a form order on January 10, 1997, and neither party filed a\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion asking for a clarification within the ten day period\r\n  following the order. Â The trial court filed a full\r\n  written order on February 10, 1997, which the supreme court found untimely\r\n  because under Rule 59(e), the trial court has only ten days from entry of judgment\r\n  to alter or amend an earlier order on his own initiative absent a â€œreservationâ€\r\n  of jurisdiction in the form order.Â  Id. at 494, 530 S.E.2d at 128; see\r\n    also Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR (â€œWhen a form or other short order or judgment\r\n  indicates that a more full and complete order or judgment is to follow, a party\r\n  need not appeal until receipt of written notice of entry of the more complete\r\n  order or judgment.â€).Â  However, the January form order contained no such\r\n  reservation, and the supreme court found because no timely Rule 59 motion was\r\n  made nor timely sua sponte order filed under Rule 59(e), the January\r\n  form order â€œmaturedâ€ into a final judgment.Â  Leviner, 339 S.C. at 494,\r\n  530 S.E.2d at 128.Â  Therefore, the order filed on February 10 was a nullity\r\n  because the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.Â  Id.\r\nWe\r\n  find Leviner distinguishable from the present case.Â  Because Coker did\r\n  not receive notice of the form order until he received the full order, the time\r\n  for him to file the appeal from the form order did not begin to run until he\r\n  received the full order.Â  Thus, his appeal was timely.Â  Further, although the\r\n  form order did not mention the full order would follow, the master instructed\r\n  one of the defendantsâ€™ attorneys to draft the longer order.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  master reserved jurisdiction and could enter the full order.\r\nII.&nbsp; Doctrine of\r\n  Acquiescence\r\nCoker\r\n  argues the master erred in finding the evidence failed to raise any judiciable\r\n  issue of fact, and thus, concluding the defendants were entitled to summary\r\n  judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  boundary dispute is an action at law, and the location of a disputed boundary\r\n  line is a question of fact.â€Â  Bodiford v.

Â â€œ[A]cquiescence is a\r\n  question of fact determined by the intent of the parties.â€Â  Id. at 198,\r\n  332 S.E.2d at 549.Â  \r\n\r\n\t[I]f a party stands by, and sees another dealing with property in a\r\n  manner inconsistent with his rights, and makes no objection, he cannot afterwards\r\n  have relief.Â  His silence permits or encourages others to part with their money\r\n  or property, and he cannot complain that his interest[s] are affected.Â  His\r\n  silence is acquiescence and it\r\n  estops him.\r\n\r\nMcClintic\r\n  v. Davis, 228\r\n  S.C. 378, 383, 90 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1955)\r\n  (quoting S. Ry. v. Day, 140 S.C. 388, 138 S.E. 240 (1926)).\r\nâ€œIf\r\n  adjoining landowners occupy their respective premises up to a certain line,\r\n  which they mutually recognize and acquiesce in for a long period of time, they\r\n  are precluded from claiming the boundary line thus recognized and acquiesced in\r\n  is not the true one.â€Â  Gardner v. Mozingo, 293 S.C. 23, 26, 358 S.E.2d\r\n  390, 392&nbsp;(1987).Â  â€œIn other words, such recognition of, and acquiescence\r\n  in, a line as the true boundary line, if continued for a sufficient length of\r\n  time, will afford a conclusive presumption that the line thus acquiesced in is\r\n  the true boundary line.â€Â  Knox v.\r\n    Bogan,&nbsp;322 S.C. 64, 72, 472 S.E.2d 43, 48&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996). Â The length of time required is usually that prescribed by the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, acquiescence can be established even if the period of\r\n  time is very short; acquiescence need not continue for the period necessary to\r\n  establish adverse possession. Â McClintic, 228\r\n  S.C. at 384, 90 S.E.2d at 366.Â  For\r\n  a new boundary to be established by acquiescence, both parties must recognize a\r\n  particular line constituted the true property line.Â  See Croft v.\r\n    Sanders, 283 S.C. 507, 510, 323 S.E.2d 791, 793&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  when boundary lines have â€œbeen\r\n  located and designated by monuments and there is a discrepancy between the\r\n  calls for these monuments and courses and distances shown by a plan referred to\r\n  in the conveyance, the normal rule as to the controlling effect of calls for\r\n  monuments will be followed.â€Â  Klapman v. Hook, 206 S.C. 51, __, 32 S.E.2d 882, 883 (1945).Â  â€œ[U]nder the rules for determining disputed boundaries â€˜the\r\n  quantity of land named in the deed is ordinarily one of the lowest in the scale\r\n  of importance.â€™â€ Â Id. at __, 32 S.E.2d at 883 (quoting Holden v. Cantrell,\r\n  100 S.C. 265, 84 S.E. 828 (1915)).\r\nWhen a party makes a motion for summary judgment, â€œan\r\n  adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations\r\n  or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise\r\n  provided in this Rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a\r\n  genuine issue for trial.â€Â  S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Combustion Engâ€™g,\r\n    Inc., 283 S.C. 182, 188-89, 322 S.E.2d 453, 457&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984).Â  If\r\n  the adverse party does not respond accordingly, the trial court shall enter\r\n  summary judgment against him if appropriate.Â  Id. at 189, 322 S.E.2d at\r\n  457.Â  When a party makes no factual showing in opposition to a motion for\r\n  summary judgment, the trial â€œcourt must grant summary judgment to the moving\r\n  party if, under the facts presented, the latter is entitled to summary judgment\r\n  as matter of law.â€Â  Id.\r\nCoker\r\n  offered plats and an affidavit in support of his contention the boundaries on\r\n  the ground are incorrect.Â  However, the record contains nothing to dispute\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ evidence they have lived on their property with the boundaries as\r\n  they claim for at least twenty years.Â  The plats simply show that at some\r\n  point, the boundaries may have been as Coker asserts they were intended.Â \r\n  Further, the affidavit is purely speculative as to what happened, and thus,\r\n  does not raise a material question of fact.Â  Accordingly, the master did not\r\n  err in granting summary judgment and the order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondents\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss the appeal asserting Cokerâ€™s appeal was not timely.Â \r\n  We denied the motion but allowed them to address the issue in their brief.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4472","title":"Eadie v.

Eadie (Eadie) appeals from a trial\r\n  court order granting summary judgment in favor of Steven M. Krause and the\r\n  law firm of Krause and Moorhead, P.A. (Krause).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe instant case arises from a workers' compensation claim in\r\n  which Krause was retained to represent Eadie in an action seeking workers'\r\n  compensation benefits for injuries he sustained while completing a job for\r\n  Complete Company, Inc. (Complete). \r\nComplete is a small commercial industrial maintenance business\r\n  incorporated in Tennessee and wholly owned by Ronald Rigsby (Rigsby).Â  In May 1997,\r\n  Eadie, a resident of Anderson, South Carolina, learned that Rigsby was looking\r\n  for help doing concrete repair for Home Depot.Â  Having performed concrete\r\n  repairs in the past, Eadie, while in South Carolina, called Rigsby in Tennessee to inquire about the work. Â During their conversation, Rigsby allegedly offered\r\n  to pay Eadie to perform concrete repairs at a Home Depot store in North Carolina.Â  Eadie allegedly accepted Rigsby's offer and began work at the North\r\n  Carolina Home Depot shortly thereafter.[1]Â  \r\nAfter completing the job in North Carolina, Complete\r\n  retained Eadie to perform four similar repairs at Home Depot locations in North Carolina and Florida.Â  For each job, Eadie personally purchased or rented the\r\n  necessary supplies and equipment to complete the work.Â  Eadie's rate of pay was\r\n  calculated by Rigsby based upon the square footage of the concrete repair. \r\nOn June 10, 1997, Eadie was seriously injured in a one-vehicle\r\n  accident while picking up concrete in Atlanta, Georgia, for a concrete repair\r\n  job at a Home Depot store in Charlotte, North Carolina.Â  Eadie was rendered\r\n  paraplegic as a result of the accident. \r\nIn August 1997, Eadie retained Krause to represent him in the\r\n  workers' compensation and personal injury claims arising from the accident.Â  On\r\n  September 19, 1997, Krause filed a Form 50 with the South Carolina Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission indicating Complete as Eadie's employer.Â  In response,\r\n  Complete filed a Form 51 asserting the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission lacked jurisdiction on the grounds that the employer and &quot;alleged\r\n  employee&quot; were not subject to South Carolina law and that the\r\n  employer-employee relationship did not exist. Depositions of Eadie and Rigsby\r\n  were conducted on February 16, 1998, and a hearing on the matter was scheduled\r\n  for April 14, 1998.Â  The hearing was eventually postponed and no further\r\n  proceedings were commenced before the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission. \r\nIn June 1998, Eadie filed notices of claim with the Georgia\r\n  State Board of Workers' Compensation and the North Carolina Industrial\r\n  Commission.Â  Krause's office assisted Eadie in filing these notices to toll the\r\n  statute.Â  At this time, Krause associated attorney Philip R. Newman\r\n  (Newman) of Puryear &amp; Newman, in Franklin, Tennessee, to represent Eadie in\r\n  a Tennessee action. Newman filed a complaint in the circuit court for Williamson County, Tennessee, seeking workers' compensation benefits against Complete and\r\n  Home Depot.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Krause associated Georgia counsel and filed a\r\n  civil action on behalf of Eadie.Â  Eadie alleged that Construction Materials\r\n  Ltd., the company from which Eadie received the concrete, improperly loaded the\r\n  trailer that Eadie was towing at the time of the accident.Â  This case settled\r\n  in April 2001 and Eadie received $590,000 as a result of that lawsuit.Â  \r\nIn the Tennessee case, Home Depot, Complete, and Complete's\r\n  insurer moved for summary judgment on the basis that Eadie was not an employee.\r\n  Additionally, Complete alleged that Eadie had affirmatively sought workers'\r\n  compensation benefits in three other states and therefore had made a binding\r\n  election of remedies, under Tennessee law, barring him from recovery in Tennessee.Â  The Tennessee trial court found in favor of Complete as to the election of\r\n  remedies argument and granted Home Depot's summary judgment motion on the\r\n  ground that Eadie was not an employee of Home Depot.Â  \r\nThereafter, Eadie appealed to the Tennessee Special Workers'\r\n  Compensation Appeals Panel (Tennessee Appeals Panel).Â  In a memorandum opinion\r\n  dated December 19, 2003, the three-judge panel affirmed the trial court's\r\n  finding that Eadie was not an employee of Home Depot and unanimously reversed\r\n  the trial court's ruling as to Complete on the election of remedies issue.Â  The\r\n  Tennessee Appeals Panel held that Eadie's filing of notices of claim in other\r\n  states did not amount to an election of remedies.Â  In arriving at its\r\n  determination, the panel noted that Eadie did not receive any compensation\r\n  benefits in the other three states, nor had any of his claims been denied. \r\nComplete and its insurer appealed the decision of the\r\n  Tennessee Appeals Panel to the Supreme Court of Tennessee.Â  In its final\r\n  opinion, dated August 27, 2004, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that the\r\n  filing of a claim in South Carolina, the request for a hearing here, and the\r\n  taking of depositions in the matter constituted affirmative acts to obtain\r\n  benefits in another state sufficient to constitute a binding election of\r\n  remedies that barred Eadie's claim in Tennessee.\r\nOn November 16, 2005, Eadie filed the instant action against\r\n  Krause and his law firm alleging that the defendants failed to timely and\r\n  properly commence workers' compensation proceedings on Eadie's behalf and that\r\n  as a result of defendants' acts and omissions, Eadie lost the ability to\r\n  recover workers' compensation benefits.Â  Krause and his law firm filed a motion\r\n  for summary judgment on the ground that Eadie did not have a valid South\r\n  Carolina workers' compensation claim because: (1) he was an independent\r\n  contractor; and (2) his purported employer, Complete, was not subject to the\r\n  jurisdiction of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission as it\r\n  lacked the requisite number of employees to fall within the purview of the\r\n  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act.Â  Eadie opposed Krause's motion\r\n  asserting his complaint was broader than a consideration of the South Carolina workers' compensation matter.Â  Eadie argued that material facts are in\r\n  dispute with regard to whether he was an employee of Complete and entitled to\r\n  workers' compensation benefits under Tennessee, North Carolina, or Georgia law. \r\nAt oral argument before the trial court, the parties focused\r\n  primarily on the question of whether Eadie was an employee or an independent\r\n  contractor of Complete at the time of his injury.Â  As such, the trial court\r\n  requested the parties submit additional memoranda on independent contractor law\r\n  in the four states at issue.Â  Additionally, the trial court requested that any\r\n  further materials pertinent to the motion be submitted by May 28, 2007.Â  Eadie\r\n  responded by filing several affidavits, exhibits, and supplemental memoranda on\r\n  or shortly after the deadline.Â  Krause filed a responsive affidavit as well as\r\n  Eadie's responses to requests to admit.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Krause on July 9, 2007.Â  Eadie filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,\r\n  which was denied on August 23, 2007.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court\r\n  under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â Boyd v. Bellsouth Telephone Telegraph Co., Inc.,\r\n  369 S.C. 410, 415, 633 S.E.2d 136, 138 (2006).Â  Summary judgment is proper\r\n  where no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Town of Summerville v. City of North Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008); Hurst v. East Coast Hockey League, Inc., 371 S.C. 33, 36, 637 S.E.2d 560,\r\n  561 (2006).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corrs., 368\r\n  S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEadie maintains the trial court erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment on the ground disputed issues of material fact exist\r\n  concerning whether Krause's alleged professional errors proximately caused\r\n  injuries to Eadie.Â  Specifically, Eadie argues the existence of disputed issues\r\n  of material fact concerning: (1) whether the acceptance of the telephone offer\r\n  of employment took place in Tennessee and was sufficient to establish\r\n  jurisdiction in Tennessee;[2] (2) whether Eadie was an employee of Complete under Tennessee law or an\r\n  independent contractor; and (3) whether the application of Tennessee's election\r\n  of remedies doctrine was reasonably foreseeable.[3]Â  \r\nIn order to prevail in a legal malpractice claim, a\r\n  plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2)\r\n  a breach of duty by the attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) the damage\r\n  was proximately caused by the breach of duty.Â  Holy Loch Distributors, Inc.\r\n    v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 26, 531 S.E.2d 282, 285 (2000).Â Â  The plaintiff\r\n  must prove that he most probably would have been successful in the action if\r\n  the attorney had not committed the alleged malpractice.Â  Brown v. Theos,\r\n  345 S.C. 626, 629, 550 S.E.2d 304, 306 (2001) (internal citation omitted).Â \r\n  Accordingly, where a plaintiff alleging legal malpractice fails to show that\r\n  the underlying claim would have been successful, defendant is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  This principle accords with the\r\n  requirement that the alleged act of negligence proximately causes damage.\r\nGiven the burden of the plaintiff in a legal\r\n  malpractice action to prove the probability of success of the underlying claim,\r\n  the requisite analysis of the underlying claim that accompanies this burden\r\n  requires, in essence, a trial within a trial.[4] Shearon v. Seaman, 198 S.W.3d 209, 210 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).Â  Under\r\n  this trial within a trial scenario, we must address the viability of Eadie's Tennessee workers' compensation claim under Tennessee law in order to determine whether the\r\n  elements of the instant legal malpractice claim can be satisfied. \r\nTurning to the underlying Tennessee workers'\r\n  compensation claim, we note that pursuant to Section 50-6-225(a)(3) of the\r\n  Tennessee Code, civil actions for workers' compensation benefits are commenced\r\n  before a judge in the circuit or chancery court.Â  Tenn. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  50-6-225(a)(3) (West 2008) (&quot;Neither party in a civil action filed\r\n  pursuant to this section shall have the right to demand a jury.&quot;).Â  When\r\n  the facts are undisputed, the question is one of law.Â  Travelers Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Dozier, 410 S.W.2d 904, 907 (Tenn. 1966).Â  When there is a dispute as to\r\n  particular facts, the question becomes one of mixed law and fact for the\r\n  court.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, it is through this specialized lens that we would\r\n  normally address the question of whether Eadie had a legal basis for a workers'\r\n  compensation claim in Tennessee in order to determine the probability of\r\n  success absent any malpractice. \r\nHowever, before reaching the underlying claim, we note\r\n  the Tennessee Supreme Court held the affirmative acts of filing, taking a\r\n  deposition, and requesting a hearing in South Carolina constituted a binding\r\n  election of remedies barring Eadie's claim in Tennessee; because of these same\r\n  acts, Eadie claims Krause breached a duty to foresee a Tennessee election of\r\n  remedies bar that proximately caused him damage.Â  \r\nWe are mindful of and respect the interpretation of Tennessee law by the Tennessee Supreme Court since we must, in the context of this\r\n  malpractice action, utilize Tennessee law in our analysis.Â  However, in this South Carolina malpractice litigation, we nonetheless must scrutinize the action of the\r\n  attorney involved to determine whether there are any factual disputes for\r\n  purposes of summary judgment.Â  Even assuming Eadie's status as an employee for\r\n  purposes of our analysis, we nonetheless may resolve this case as a matter of\r\n  law on the issue of whether Krause should have foreseen his actions in\r\n  attempting to preserve his client's rights in South Carolina would preclude the\r\n  Tennessee workers' compensation claim under the election of remedies doctrine\r\n  of Tennessee which existed at that time.\r\nAs indicated, essential elements of a legal\r\n  malpractice claim are duty and proximate cause.Â  Proximate cause requires proof\r\n  of causation in fact and legal cause.Â  Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 298,\r\n  592 S.E.2d 315, 320 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Causation in fact is proved by\r\n  establishing the plaintiff's injury would not have occurred &quot;but for&quot;\r\n  the defendant's negligence.Â  Id.Â  Legal cause is proved by establishing\r\n  foreseeability.Â  Id.Â  When the injury complained of is not reasonably\r\n  foreseeable, in the exercise of due care, there is no liability.[5] Â Stone\r\n    v. Bethea, 251 S.C. 157, 161, 161 S.E.2d 171, 173 (1968). Â In the context\r\n  of a legal malpractice action, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the\r\n  alleged malpractice proximately caused damage to plaintiff and the defendant\r\n  may be held liable for anything which appears to have been a natural and\r\n  probable consequence of his negligence.Â  Sims, 357 S.C. at 298, 592\r\n  S.E.2d at 320. Â Consequently, since Eadie alleges malpractice from Krause's\r\n  actions in South Carolina, we address whether the Tennessee court's conclusion\r\n  that Krause's pursuit of a claim in South Carolina constituted a binding\r\n  election of remedies was reasonably foreseeable by counsel thus constituting a\r\n  breach of duty proximately causing damage to his client.Â  \r\nUnder the doctrine of election of remedies, Tennessee case\r\n  law at the time of Eadie's claim held that an employee injured on the job in\r\n  another state who files a workers' compensation claim in that jurisdiction and\r\n  obtains either an award, or a court-approved settlement of the claim, or who\r\n  actively pursues a claim in a venue that has jurisdiction, is barred\r\n  from filing a subsequent claim in Tennessee. Â Gray v. Holloway Construction\r\n    Co., 834 S.W.2d 277, 279 (Tenn. 1992). Â \r\nIn the instant case, the Tennessee Supreme Court only\r\n  addressed whether the actions taken by Krause in South Carolina constituted an\r\n  election of remedies.Â  While we might view those same acts differently for\r\n  purposes of South Carolina law, we need not distinguish the effect of these\r\n  acts for even if these acts are deemed sufficient affirmative acts under Tennessee law, the Tennessee Supreme Court did not address whether the alleged affirmative\r\n  acts occurred in a forum with jurisdiction over the matter. Â See Gray,\r\n  834 S.W.2d at 279 (stating an employee injured on the job in another state who\r\n    actively pursues a claim in a venue that has jurisdiction is barred from\r\n  filing a subsequent claim in Tennessee) (emphasis added).\r\nAs we previously indicated, we must respect the\r\n  interpretation of Tennessee law by the Tennessee Supreme Court.Â  Notwithstanding,\r\n  our review cannot be premised on speculation as to why the Tennessee Supreme\r\n  Court did not address its past precedent on the &quot;venue with jurisdiction&quot;\r\n  element of its earlier cases.Â  However, we may consider the question before us\r\n  from two perspectives: 1) whether counsel should have foreseen that Tennessee\r\n  would not address one of the components of the doctrine established at the\r\n  time; or, alternatively, 2) whether counsel should have foreseen that the\r\n  Tennessee Supreme Court would modify its common law on the election of remedies\r\n  doctrine by removing the &quot;venue with jurisdiction&quot; element.Â  While we\r\n  do not suggest that the Tennessee Supreme Court has modified its doctrine, we\r\n  find it appropriate to consider both alternatives because we are reviewing\r\n  whether counsel erred in not foreseeing the possible application of the\r\n  doctrine before taking action in South Carolina. \r\nHere, as the trial court in South Carolina correctly\r\n  found, the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission did not have jurisdiction\r\n  over Eadie's workers' compensation claim because Complete lacked the requisite\r\n  number of employees in South Carolina as required by Section 42-1-360(2) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code.Â  This ruling was not appealed; thus, it is the law of the\r\n  case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Hous. Corp., 338\r\n  S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an\r\n  unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â  \r\nThus, utilizing Tennessee's own interpretation of its election\r\n  of remedies precedent at the time of counsel's conduct, this court cannot find\r\n  the alleged &quot;affirmative&quot; acts in South Carolina constituted a breach\r\n  of duty or proximately caused damage since Tennessee law at the time would\r\n  require that Krause's affirmative acts occur in a venue that had jurisdiction,\r\n  which does not include South Carolina. Â See Gray, 834 S.W.2d at\r\n  279. Â Under our first alternative, if we were to consider only one element of\r\n  the Tennessee election of remedies doctrine existing at the time, we would be\r\n  prevented from objectively assessing the conduct of counsel; thus, we also must\r\n  consider the &quot;venue with jurisdiction&quot; element even if the Tennessee\r\n  Supreme Court failed to do so.Â  We are sympathetic to a claim that the\r\n  Tennessee Supreme Court may not have been presented with the argument that\r\n  South Carolina was not a &quot;venue with jurisdiction&quot; and that Tennessee's\r\n  election of remedies law should not actually apply; however, the alleged\r\n  malpractice raised by the pleadings is whether counsel should have reasonably\r\n  foreseen the application of the Tennessee election of remedies bar such that\r\n  counsel should have avoided the alleged acts he took in South Carolina to\r\n  preserve any rights his client might have here.Â  \r\nTherefore, because we may affirm for any ground\r\n  appearing in the record, we conclude, as a matter of law, that the application\r\n  of Tennessee's election of remedies doctrine under this alternative was not\r\n  foreseeable by Krause since, even if the acts in South Carolina were sufficient\r\n  affirmative acts under Tennessee law, the acts occurred in a venue in which\r\n  there was no workers' compensation jurisdiction.[6] Â See Rule 220(c), SCACR; Upchurch v. New York Times Co., 314 S.C.\r\n  531, 538, 431 S.E.2d 558, 562 (1993) (&quot;We may affirm the trial judge for\r\n  any reason appearing in the record.&quot;).Â  We further hold, in deference to\r\n  the possibility that the Tennessee Supreme Court signaled a change in its prior\r\n  precedent under the alternative consideration we suggested, that counsel could\r\n  not have reasonably foreseen any modification of the existing precedent since\r\n  no other case at the time actually indicates or signals a change in precedent.Â \r\n  Accordingly, since material facts are not in dispute as to this component of\r\n  the claim, summary judgment in the South Carolina litigation is appropriate.\r\nGiven the dispositive nature of this determination,\r\n  the court need not address Eadie's remaining arguments including, but not\r\n  limited to, the acceptance of the contract for hire and whether Eadie was an\r\n  employee of Complete.[7]Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not review\r\n  remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\n  appeal); see also Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292,\r\n  353 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;Where a decision is based on\r\n  alternative grounds, either of which independent of the other is sufficient to\r\n  support it, the decision will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.&quot;); see also State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 86, 276 S.E.2d 163,\r\n  170 (1981) (stating all other grounds not argued or briefed are deemed\r\n  abandoned on appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court did not err in\r\n  granting summary judgment on the ground the application of the election of\r\n  remedies doctrine as a bar to Eadie's claim in Tennessee was not reasonably foreseeable.\r\n  Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties disagree as to who made the offer;\r\n  however, we may resolve this case without a determination of this issue.\r\n[2] The trial court indicated its concern as to a\r\n  possible sham affidavit by Eadie; however, since the court never excluded the\r\n  affidavit on this basis, the affidavit is part of the record for purposes of this\r\n  action.\r\n[3] Eadie also asserts on appeal the trial court erred in denying his motion to\r\n  recuse based upon the trial judge's previous professional relationship with\r\n  Krause and the fact the trial judge allowed less than 40 business days for the\r\n  parties to complete discovery.Â  The fact the trial judge had a previous\r\n  professional relationship with Krause is insufficient evidence, standing alone,\r\n  of bias or prejudice.Â  See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 524, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004) (stating &quot;[i]t is not sufficient for a party\r\n  seeking disqualification to simply allege bias; the party must show some\r\n  evidence of bias or prejudice.&quot;).Â  Moreover, while we acknowledge the\r\n  short time frame for discovery, there is no evidence the time frame harmed\r\n  Eadie so as to demonstrate the trial judge's alleged bias against Eadie.Â  As\r\n  such, we do not find evidence of bias or prejudice sufficient to warrant\r\n  reversal of the trial judge's denial of appellant's motion to recuse.\r\n[4] On appeal, Eadie challenges the trial court's finding\r\n  only as to the Tennessee workers' compensation claim.Â  \r\n[5] Generally, issues of foreseeability and proximate\r\n  cause are questions for a jury.Â  However, to survive a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, the plaintiff must offer some evidence that a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact exists as to each element of the claim unless that element is either\r\n  uncontested or agreed to by stipulation; otherwise, the plaintiff cannot meet\r\n  his burden of proof and the claim may be determined as a matter of law by the\r\n  trial judge.Â  Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 116,\r\n  410 S.E.2d 537, 546 (1991) (defendant entitled to judgment as a matter of law\r\n  where plaintiff failed to demonstrate one element of the claim and therefore\r\n  could not meet the required burden of proof).\r\n[6] As previously indicated, even Complete asserted in\r\n  its Form 51 that South Carolina lacked jurisdiction.\r\n[7] For similar reasons, we need not address whether the\r\n  parties consented to litigate the merits of the Tennessee claim on the motion\r\n  for summary judgment.Â  While we note the court in this type of proceeding would\r\n  ultimately address the viability of the underlying claim, we need not address\r\n  this ground since our opinion focuses only on the alleged act of negligence as\r\n  to failing to foresee the application of the election of remedies bar, not the\r\n  underlying merits of the Tennessee claim.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4473","title":"Hollins v.

Massey, of Columbia, and M. David Scott, of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tStephen G. Morrison, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Maria\r\n  Hollins appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Wal-Mart in this action for\r\n  negligent hiring and retention.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nTen-year-old Jane Doe accompanied her mother, Hollins,\r\n  and sister to the Wal-Mart located on Forest Drive in Columbia.Â  While her\r\n  mother and sister shopped in another area of the store, Doe browsed through the\r\n  merchandise in the electronics department.Â  There, Randall, a Wal-Mart\r\n  employee, touched Doeâ€™s private areas and began masturbating in her presence.Â \r\n  As a result of this incident, Hollins commenced negligent hiring and retention\r\n  claims against Wal-Mart on behalf of Doe.\r\nThe incident in\r\n  question generated vast amounts of pre-trial media coverage.Â  Recognizing this,\r\n  the trial court implemented extraordinary procedures to ensure the selection of\r\n  an impartial jury.Â  In addition to performing its traditional function of\r\n  questioning potential jurors during general qualification, the trial court also\r\n  required potential jurors to complete questionnaires.Â  Additionally, the court permitted\r\n  counsel to conduct extended voir dire of the potential jurors.\r\nDuring general\r\n  qualification, the trial court asked whether a relationship existed between the\r\n  potential jurors and counsel for the parties.Â  Juror B, an attorney,\r\n  acknowledged she opposed Hollinsâ€™ counsel in a previous proceeding.Â  However, Juror\r\n  B affirmed she could still be fair and impartial.Â  Hollinsâ€™ counsel asked the\r\n  trial court to strike Juror B for cause and requested permission to question\r\n  her about this matter.Â Â  The trial court noted Juror B already indicated she\r\n  could be fair and impartial.Â  Counsel for Hollins made no objection to the\r\n  denial of further voir dire and began discussing the next juror.Â  \r\nIn her\r\n  questionnaire, Juror D acknowledged her brother worked at the Wal-Mart where\r\n  the incident occurred.Â  Because of this, the trial court permitted counsel for Hollins to conduct additional voir dire of Juror D.Â  In her dialogue with\r\n  Hollinsâ€™ counsel, Juror D explained she had not discussed the lawsuit with her\r\n  brother; furthermore, she stated she possessed no knowledge of the lawsuit\r\n  whatsoever.Â  Finally, Juror D affirmed her brotherâ€™s employment at Wal-Mart\r\n  would not affect her ability to be fair and impartial.Â  Subsequently, Hollinsâ€™\r\n  counsel moved to dismiss Juror D for cause.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  request.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  jury selection, Juror B informed the trial court that a partner in her firmâ€™s Charleston office had previously represented Wal-Mart in a class action lawsuit.Â  The\r\n  trial court posed several questions to Juror B in light of this discovery.Â \r\n  Juror B responded by noting she never worked in the Charleston office, did not\r\n  personally work on the case, and her firm no longer represented Wal-Mart.Â  Again,\r\n  Juror B acknowledged she could still be fair and impartial.Â  Hollins failed to\r\n  seek additional voir dire of Juror B; instead, Hollins simply moved to strike\r\n  Juror B for cause.Â  The trial court denied this request.Â  \r\nOn two previous\r\n  occasions, Randall exposed himself to young girls while working for Wal-Mart.Â  The\r\n  first incident was revealed to the jury during Francis Parkerâ€™s testimony.Â \r\n  Parker testified Randall exposed himself to her sixteen-year-old daughter in\r\n  JDâ€™s Beauty Supply Store, situated across from the Forest Drive Wal-Mart.Â  After\r\n  the incident, Parker informed the assistant manager at Wal-Mart and another\r\n  store employee of Randallâ€™s actions.Â  The second incident concerned Randallâ€™s\r\n  arrest outside of a different Columbia-area Wal-Mart.Â  Hollins attempted to\r\n  introduce this evidence through the testimony of Sergeant William Connors.Â \r\n  However, the trial court excluded Sgt. Connorsâ€™ testimony as irrelevant.Â  In\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s view, Hollins failed to connect the incident with any\r\n  evidence tending to demonstrate Wal-Martâ€™s actual or constructive knowledge of\r\n  the arrest.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Sgt. Connorsâ€™ deposition, two young girls and their mother informed him that\r\n  Randall exposed himself to the girls.Â  Thereafter, Sgt. Connors arrested\r\n  Randall on the edge of the Wal-Mart location without capturing the attention of\r\n  on-lookers or Wal-Mart employees.Â  Sgt. Connors placed Randall inside his\r\n  unmarked patrol car until one City of Columbia squad car and one unmarked car\r\n  arrived on the scene.Â  At that time, Sgt. Connors transferred custody of\r\n  Randall to the City of Columbia.Â  Sgt. Connors stated no sirens or flashing\r\n  lights were used, and no employee from Wal-Mart arrived on the scene.Â  Although\r\n  Randall worked at the Wal-Mart located on Forest Drive, he was not working when\r\n  he was arrested and was dressed in plain clothes.Â  Thus, Wal-Mart was not\r\n  contacted about the arrest.Â  Thereafter, Randall asked for and received a leave\r\n  of absence from Wal-Mart, offering no reason for his request. \r\nThe\r\n  jury returned a verdict in favor of Wal-Mart.Â  Hollins filed timely written\r\n  post-trial motions seeking a new trial absolute and/or judgment notwithstanding\r\n  the verdict (JNOV).Â  In these motions, Hollins claimed the trial court denied\r\n  her right to a fair and impartial jury and erroneously excluded the testimony\r\n  of Sgt. Connors.Â  The trial court issued a written order denying Hollinsâ€™\r\n  post-trial motions on August 3, 2006.Â  On August 17, Hollins submitted a motion\r\n  to reconsider, alter, and amend the order pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  In\r\n  this Rule 59(e) motion, Hollins primarily noted small disagreements with the\r\n  manner in which the trial court characterized portions of its order.Â  In\r\n  addition, she asked the court to reconsider its previous order denying her\r\n  motion for a new trial/JNOV.Â  The trial court denied Hollinsâ€™ motion in writing\r\n  on November 2, noting she â€œraises no additional legal or factual basis for\r\n  amending my order of August 3, 2006.â€Â  This appeal followed with the service of\r\n  Hollinsâ€™ notice of appeal on November 29, 2006.[1]Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe manner and scope of voir dire is largely within\r\n  the discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 16,\r\n  482 S.E.2d 760, 765 (1997).Â  â€œOn appeal, this court will rely on the judgment\r\n  of the trial judge who is able to observe the character and demeanor of the\r\n  jurors, unless the record firmly establishes an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Creighton\r\n    v. Colingy Plaza Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 334 S.C. 96, 109, 512 S.E.2d 510, 517 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998).Â  The exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court.Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  The courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\na.Â  Juror\r\n  IssuesÂ  Â Â Â \r\nHollins\r\n  alleges the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing her to conduct\r\n  extensive voir dire of Juror B on two separate occasions.Â  The first incident\r\n  occurred when Juror B disclosed she opposed counsel for Hollins in prior\r\n  litigation.Â  The second incident occurred when Juror B informed the court that\r\n  a member of her law firm previously represented Wal-Mart in a class action\r\n  lawsuit.Â Â  \r\nThese arguments are\r\n  not preserved for appeal.Â  After Juror B disclosed she opposed counsel for Hollins in prior litigation, Hollins accepted the trial courtâ€™s denial of\r\n  additional voir dire without objection.Â  After the court made its ruling,\r\n  Hollins stated â€œ[a]ll right, we wonâ€™tâ€”Okay,â€ and immediately began discussing\r\n  the next juror.Â  No objection was made to the denial of further voir dire.Â \r\n  Because Hollins acquiesced in the trial courtâ€™s ruling, she failed to preserve\r\n  the issue of the denial of additional voir dire for appellate review.Â  See Patterson, 324 S.C. at 17, 482 S.E.2d at 766 (affirming on preservation\r\n  grounds where counsel accepted the trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow additional\r\n  voir dire).Â  After learning a member of Juror Bâ€™s law firm previously\r\n  represented Wal-Mart in another matter, Hollins failed to ask the trial court\r\n  to conduct further voir dire of Juror B.Â  Instead, Hollins only asked the trial\r\n  court to strike Juror B for cause.Â  Accordingly, this argument is also not\r\n  preserved for appeal.Â  See State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510,\r\n  476 S.E.2d 903, 911-12 (1996) (holding a contemporaneous objection must be made\r\n  to preserve the issue for review). \r\nNext,\r\n  Hollins claims the trial court denied her right to an impartial jury by\r\n  refusing to strike Juror B for cause after learning a member of her law firm\r\n  previously represented Wal-Mart in a class action lawsuit.Â  In addition,\r\n  Hollins argues the trial court erred by refusing to strike Juror D for cause\r\n  after learning her brother worked at the Wal-Mart where the incident took place.Â \r\n  Hollins argues this error was particularly egregious in light of the courtâ€™s knowledge\r\n  that Juror Dâ€™s brotherâ€™s direct supervisor would sit at the defense table\r\n  during trial.\r\nThe decision to\r\n  disqualify a juror is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Abofreka\r\n    v. Alston Tobacco Co., 288 S.C. 122, 125, 341 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1986).Â  â€œA\r\n  prior business relationship between a juror and a party to the case does not as\r\n  a matter of law disqualify a juror.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike Juror B.Â  Upon learning this\r\n  information, the trial court immediately questioned Juror B about the matter.Â \r\n  Juror B responded by informing the trial court that the lawyer representing\r\n  Wal-Mart worked in the firmâ€™s Charleston office while she worked in the Columbia office, the representation had terminated, and she had no involvement with the\r\n  matter.Â  Finally, Juror B again acknowledged she could be fair and impartial.Â \r\n  Similarly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike\r\n  Juror D for cause.Â  The court allowed Hollins the opportunity to fully question\r\n  Juror D, and Juror D responded by asserting she had no knowledge of the matter,\r\n  had not discussed it with her brother, and could be fair and impartial.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to\r\n  strike Jurors B and D for cause.Â  See State v. Spann, 279 S.C.\r\n  399, 402, 308 S.E.2d 518, 520 (1983) (finding the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in refusing to strike a juror who stated he could be fair and\r\n  impartial).Â  \r\nb.Â  Evidentiary\r\n  Matters\r\nLastly, Hollins\r\n  argues the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Sgt. Connorsâ€™\r\n  testimony.Â  According to Hollins, Sgt. Connorsâ€™ testimony was relevant to her\r\n  negligent supervision claim.Â  Â Â \r\nRelevant evidence\r\n  is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  The admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence in general is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 25, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  In addressing the\r\n  law of negligent supervision, our supreme court has cited the Restatement\r\n  (Second) of Torts Â§ 317 (1965). Â See Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus,\r\n  309 S.C. 114, 116-17, 420 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1992).Â  Comment c to section 317 of\r\n  the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides â€œthe master may subject himself to\r\n  liability under the rule stated in this Section by retaining in his employment\r\n  servants who, to his knowledge,\r\n  are in the habit of misconducting themselves in a manner dangerous to others.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  trial court properly excluded Sgt. Connorsâ€™ testimony as irrelevant because\r\n  Hollins failed to demonstrate that Wal-Mart knew of the arrest or should have\r\n  known about it.Â  According to Sgt. Connors, the arrest took place on the edge\r\n  of the Garners Ferry Wal-Mart property without the use of sirens or flashing\r\n  lights and without attracting the attention of on-lookers.Â  Although Randall\r\n  worked at another Wal-Mart in the Columbia area, he was â€œoff the clockâ€ at the\r\n  time of his arrest and dressed in plain clothes.Â  Finally, Wal-Mart was not\r\n  contacted about the incident.Â  In addition, contrary to Hollinsâ€™ assertions, we\r\n  fail to see how Randallâ€™s request for a leave of absence charges Wal-Mart with\r\n  constructive knowledge of his arrest.Â  Therefore, absent evidence Wal-Mart\r\n  either was aware of the incident or should have been aware of it, the trial\r\n  court properly excluded the evidence as irrelevant.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wal-Mart contends Hollinsâ€™ August 17 motion did not\r\n  toll the time for appeal; therefore, service of her notice of appeal was\r\n  untimely.Â  We believe a close question is presented in this evolving area of\r\n  the law.Â  See Matthews v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 357\r\n  S.C. 594, 594 S.E.2d 177 (Ct. App. 2004), overruled by Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reach the merits of this appeal.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4474","title":"Stringer v.

Macaulay, Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4474\r\nHeard November 19, 2008 â€“ Filed December\r\n  23, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCharles R. Norris, of Columbia, and John P. Riordan, of Greenville, for Appellant. \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDonald Leverette Allen, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this action arising from an automobile accident, the circuit\r\n  court held Andrew F. Stringer, III (Stringer) had uninterrupted automobile coverage\r\n  with State Farm Mutual\r\n  Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm)\r\n  and dismissed Stringerâ€™s claims for breach of contract accompanied by a\r\n  fraudulent act, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, emotional\r\n  damages, and attorneys fees.Â  State Farm appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nOn July 31, 2002, Stringer was involved in an automobile accident in which he was driving a\r\n  1984 Chevrolet truck.Â  The accident was caused by an uninsured driver named\r\n  Troy Robinson.Â  Stringer suffered various injuries, some of which are\r\n  permanent.Â  Stringer made a payment of $424.76 to State Farm for a six month policy\r\n  on the truck running from February 15, 2002 until August 15, 2002.Â  After Stringer paid State Farm, there were two policy adjustments that caused an additional\r\n  $47.25 premium to be due.Â  \r\nState\r\n  Farm mailed Stringer a bill that he failed to pay.Â  The $424.76 premium paid\r\n  was sufficient to carry the policy to July 29, 2002.Â  On July 11, State Farm mailed Stringer a notice of cancellation that stated payment of $47.25 by the\r\n  cancellation date of July 29, 2002 would provide uninterrupted coverage.Â  The notice\r\n  informed that in the event of payment after that date, there would be no\r\n  coverage between the date and time of cancellation and the date and time of\r\n  reinstatement based upon a post-cancellation payment.\r\nOn\r\n  August 1, Stringer notified Sherry Jennings (Jennings), an employee of the\r\n  Quincy Waters State Farm agency, about his accident on the previous day.Â  Stringer\r\n  testified that Jennings told him there would be uninterrupted coverage if he\r\n  paid the $47.25 due.Â  Stringer sent his son to the agency where he paid the\r\n  additional $47.25 premium on August 2, 2002, after the accident.Â  Jennings accepted the payment, issued a receipt, and promptly mailed form FR-10 to the\r\n  Department of Motor Vehicles.Â  The form FR-10 verified that Stringer had valid\r\n  coverage with State Farm at the time of the accident.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court held Stringer paid his entire premium pursuant to the insurance\r\n  policy prior to the expiration of the six month policy period, which fulfilled\r\n  his obligations under the insurance policy.Â  State Farm appeals this ruling.Â  The\r\n  circuit court dismissed Stringerâ€™s claims for breach of contract accompanied by\r\n  a fraudulent act, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, emotional\r\n  damages, and attorneys fees.Â  These issues are not appealed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in ruling Stringer had\r\n  uninterrupted automobile insurance coverage for the full policy period?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law.Â  Auto-Owners\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Hamin, 368 S.C. 536, 540, 629 S.E.2d 683, 685 (Ct. App. 2006), cert.\r\n      granted, May 24, 2007; Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Prioleau, 359\r\n  S.C. 238, 241, 597 S.E.2d 165, 167 (Ct.

Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 442,\r\n  527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000)).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the\r\n  facts based on its own view of the evidence but simply determines whether the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Wilson, 345\r\n  S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); Preslar, 364 S.C. at 472, 613\r\n  S.E.2d at 384; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 583, 575 S.E.2d 852, 855\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State\r\n    v.

Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623\r\n  S.E.2d 122 (Ct.

App. 1993) (quoting Trotter\r\n      vs. State Farm, supra).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIn light of the cardinal rules governing\r\n  construction of insurance contracts, the Plaintiff complied with the language\r\n  of State Farmâ€™s coverage provision.Â  The Plaintiff paid all premiums due within\r\n  the six-month and before the end of the, then, current policy period ending August 15, 2002.Â  Moreover, and in addition, the post-collision remittance of $47.25 by\r\n  the insured and the insurerâ€™s receipt and retention of the consideration bound\r\n  the insurer to the coverage.\r\n\r\nState Farm argues the case of Jones v. State Farm Mutual Auto\r\n  Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 612 S.E.2d 719 (Ct. App. 2005), is controlling.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  In Jones, State Farm provided insurance for three of Jonesâ€™s\r\n  vehicles as late as November 1999, including a 1986 Mazda pickup truck.Â  On November 5, 1999, State Farm sent a cancellation notice informing Jones that effective November 24, 1999, coverage of the 1986 Mazda would be cancelled due to nonpayment of\r\n  premiums.Â  On December 19, 1999, Jones was seriously injured in a motor vehicle\r\n  collision while driving the 1986 Mazda.Â  Sometime after the accident, Jonesâ€™s\r\n  State Farm agent signed a Form FR-10 which stated: â€œI hereby affirm that to the\r\n  best of my knowledge the vehicle described above was insured by State Farm\r\n  insurance company on the date and time of the accident.â€\r\nAfter settling with the at-fault driverâ€™s liability carrier, Jones\r\n  sought a declaration that (1) the 1986 Mazda was covered by State Farm at the\r\n  time of the collision, (2) he was entitled to $50,000 of underinsured motorist\r\n  coverage on the Mazda, and (3) he was entitled to stack $50,000 of underinsured\r\n  motorist coverage from each of the two additional vehicles covered by State\r\n  Farm.Â  State Farm moved for summary judgment, claiming the policy had been\r\n  cancelled.Â  The trial judge ruled that State Farm was entitled to summary\r\n  judgment because State Farmâ€™s cancellation notice complied with the applicable\r\n  statute and the Form FR-10 did not affect the cancellation.\r\nThis Court held the trial judge properly granted summary judgment.\r\n  In a light most favorable to Jones, the FR-10 did not raise an issue as to the\r\n  validity of State Farmâ€™s cancellation notice.Â  We elucidated: \r\n\r\n\tThe form simply states â€œto the best of my knowledge the\r\n  vehicle described above was insured by State Farm insurance company on the date\r\n  and time of the accident.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  State Farm presented evidence\r\n  that Jones, in fact, was not insured by State Farm at the time of the accident\r\n  because his policy had been cancelled weeks earlier.Â  Jones cites no legal\r\n  authority establishing that a policy, once effectively canceled, can somehow\r\n  become renascent by virtue of a qualified representation of coverage by an\r\n  agent after a loss.\r\n\r\nIn the case at bar, Jennings not only completed Form FR-10\r\n  acknowledging coverage, but she also accepted and retained consideration from\r\n  Stringer.Â  The insured has a right to rely on the representations made by an\r\n  employee of his insurance company regarding coverage.Â  Giles v. Lanford &amp;\r\n    Gibson, Inc., 285 S.C. 285, 328 S.E.2d 916 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  If the insurer\r\n  or insurerâ€™s agents assume the duty to advise the insured, liability arises for\r\n  failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in counseling the insured.Â  Id.Â  See also Riddle-Duckworth, Inc. v. Sullivan, 253 S.C. 411, 171\r\n  S.E.2d 486 (1969).Â  When the employee of State Farm advised the insured, she\r\n  had a duty to exercise due care in giving advice.Â  Carolina Prod.

Co., 310 S.C. 32, 38, 425 S.E.2d 30, 40 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1993).\r\nThe contemporaneous representations made by Jennings are\r\n  inconsistent with State Farmâ€™s subsequent legal contention that the coverage\r\n  was interrupted.Â  State Farmâ€™s intentions were clear when it made its\r\n  representations to Stringer and its assertions to the Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles, all of which were done after receiving and retaining the $47.25\r\n  premium on August 2, 2002.\r\nThe circuit court did not make an express finding of fact in its\r\n  order that the policy is ambiguous, but the court did reference ambiguity in\r\n  its first conclusion of law.Â  This implies that the court found the policy to\r\n  be ambiguous and relied on that ambiguity in reaching its conclusions of law.Â  â€œIt\r\n  is a well settled rule that the terms of an insurance policy must be construed\r\n  most liberally in favor of the insured and where the words of a policy are\r\n  ambiguous or where they are capable of two reasonable interpretations that\r\n  construction will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured.â€Â  Garrett\r\n    v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 241 S.C. 299, 304, 128 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1962).\r\nThe circuit court quoted a section of the policy titled â€œWhen\r\n  Coverage Appliesâ€ in its findings of fact.Â  That provision states:\r\n\r\n\tThe policy period is shown under â€œPolicy Periodâ€ on the\r\n  declarations page and is for successive periods of six months each for which \r\n\tyou pay the renewal premium.Â  Payments must be made on or before the end of the\r\n  current policy period.Â  The policy period begins and ends at 12:01 A.M. Standard\r\n  Time at the address shown on the declarations page.Â  \r\n\r\n[Emphasis in\r\n  original.]Â  Because Stringer paid the additional $47.25 before the end of the\r\n  stated policy period, August 15, 2002, he was entitled to continuous,\r\n  uninterrupted coverage.Â  The circuit court correctly adopted an interpretation\r\n  most favorable to the insured based on the ambiguity and an application of Garrett.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn light of the cardinal rules governing construction of insurance\r\n  contracts, Stringer complied with the provisions of State Farmâ€™s insurance\r\n  policy.Â  Stringer paid all premiums due within the six-month coverage period\r\n  and before the end of the policy period on August 15, 2002.Â  The post-collision remittance of $47.25 by the insured and the insurerâ€™s receipt and\r\n  retention of the consideration bound the insurer to the coverage.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.Â  \r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J. (dissenting): Â I respectfully\r\n  dissent from the majority.Â  \r\nThe majority\r\n  correctly points out that when construing the language of an insurance policy, the\r\n  cardinal rule of construction is in favor of finding coverage for the insured.Â  Garrett v. Pilot Life Ins., Co., 241 S.C. 299, 128 S.E.2d 171 (1962).Â  This\r\n  rule of construction, however, applies only if the policy is ambiguous.Â  See id. at 304, 128 S.E.2d at 174 (â€œ[I]n cases where there is no ambiguity,\r\n  contracts of insurance, like other contracts, must be construed according to\r\n  the terms which the parties have used, to be taken and understood in their\r\n  plain, ordinary and popular sense.â€).\r\nAs\r\n  the majority acknowledges, the trial court made no express finding that the\r\n  policy in question was ambiguous.Â  While the majority states that such a\r\n  finding is implied by the language of the order, this Court does not sit to\r\n  speculate as to the holdings of the trial court.Â  See S.C. Coastal\r\n    Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtâ€™l Control, Op. No.\r\n  4450 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 65,\r\n  90 (â€œIssue preservation rules are designed to give the trial court a fair\r\n  opportunity to rule on the issues, and thus provide [the Court] with a platform\r\n  for meaningful appellate review.â€) (quoting Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal\r\n    Prop. Regime v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 373, 628 S.E.2d 902,\r\n  919 (Ct. App. 2006) (internal quotations omitted)).Â  An issue must be both\r\n  raised to the trial court and ruled on by the trial court to be\r\n  preserved for review by this Court. Pye v. Est. of Fox, 369 S.C. 555,\r\n  564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2006); Singleton v. Sherer, 377 S.C. 185, 208,\r\n  659 S.E.2d 196, 208 (Ct. App. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  Accordingly, as the\r\n  trial court made no ruling as to any ambiguity in the policy, construction of\r\n  the language of the policy is not an issue before this Court.[1] Â Rather, the issue is simply whether the laws of this state provide for\r\n  coverage under these particular facts; and absent an ambiguity, they do not.\r\nThe\r\n  terms of the insurance policy at issue in this case clearly state:Â  â€œ[The insured] agrees thatâ€¦[the insurer] may\r\n  increase the premium during the policy period based uponâ€¦changed information.â€Â \r\n  Further, the insured agrees â€œthat if the premium is decreased or increased\r\n  during the policy periodâ€¦[the insured] will pay for any increase in premium.â€Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on adjustments to the policy made by Stringer, an additional $47.25 in premium\r\n  came due in order to keep the policy in place until the stated termination date\r\n  of August 15, 2002.[2]Â \r\n  It is undisputed that Stringer received two notifications informing him that\r\n  failure to pay this amount would result in cancellation of the policy at 12:01\r\n  am on July 29, 2002.Â  Such cancellation is specifically provided for in the\r\n  plain language of the policy: â€œ[State Farm] will not cancel your policy before\r\n  the end of the current policy period unlessâ€¦you fail to pay the premium when\r\n  due.â€Â  In the case at hand, it is not contested that the payment of the $47.25\r\n  overdue premium was not paid until after July 29, 2002.Â  Thus, the only issue\r\n  before this Court is whether Jenningsâ€™ statement can retroactively provide\r\n  coverage.Â  It cannot.\r\nOur courts have held that an insured is entitled to rely on\r\n  representations made by the employee of the insured. Giles v. Lanford &amp;\r\n    Gibson, Inc., 285 S.C. 285, 328 S.E.2d 916 (Ct. App. 1985); however, â€œwhether or not reliance upon a representation in a\r\n  particular case is justifiable or excusable, what constitutes reasonable\r\n  prudence and diligence with respect to such reliance, and what conduct\r\n  constitutes a reckless or conscious failure to exercise such prudence, will\r\n  depend upon the various circumstances involved, such as the form and materialty\r\n  [sic] of the representations, the respective intelligence, experience, age, and\r\n  mental and physical condition of the parties, and the relation and respective\r\n  knowledge and means of knowledge of the parties.â€ Id.Â Â  In the\r\n  present case, Stringerâ€™s reliance was simply\r\n  unreasonable.Â  The record reflects that Stringer was fully aware that the policy would terminate on July 29, 2002, and as such\r\n  was fully aware that after such date he was uninsured.Â  While the trial court\r\n  found that Stringerâ€™s payment of $47.25 was in\r\n  reliance on an unsubstantiated representation that coverage would be\r\n  continuous, such reliance could not have been to Stringerâ€™s detriment as it arose after the accident had occurred.Â  Moreover,\r\n  it is significant that Stringer did not plead estoppel as basis for asserting\r\n  coverage, and the majority cites no authority that a lapsed insurance policy\r\n  can be resurrected in the absence of estoppel being plead or preserved.[3] Â \r\nThe majorityâ€™s decision not only rewards Stringerâ€™s misconduct and\r\n  languidness but also extends the law on this issue beyond that supported by our\r\n  jurisprudence.Â Â  \r\nState\r\n  Farm relies heavily on this Courtâ€™s decision in Jones\r\n    v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., 364 S.C. 222, 612 S.E.2d 719 (Ct. App. 2005), for the\r\n  proposition that post cancellation representations may not be relied on. Â While\r\n  I do not believe Jones to go so far as State Farm suggests, the majority languishes to distinguish it from\r\n  the case at hand.Â  I agree with the majority that Jones has no binding\r\n  effect on this issue; however, this is because the language relied on by State\r\n  Farm and distinguished by the majority, is not the\r\n  law of the case.Â  In Jones, this Court specifically held that the\r\n  issue of the legal effect of the agentâ€™s representation on the FR-10 form was\r\n  not preserved for appeal.Â  Id. at 234, 612 S.E.2d at 725.[4]Â  Â Â \r\nMoreover,\r\n  in discussing the merits of the issue in Jones, this Court noted the\r\n  insured â€œcites no legal authority establishing that a policy, once effectively\r\n  canceled, can somehow become renascent by virtue of a qualified representation\r\n  of coverage by an agent after a loss.â€Â  Id. at 236, 612 S.E.2d at 726.Â \r\n  Similarly, no such authority exists that would support Stringerâ€™s claim that he\r\n  had insurance coverage at the time of his accident.\r\nThe\r\n  majorityâ€™s holding would allow a situation in which\r\n  an insured could wait until after a policy has lapsed, and then, with the certainty of\r\n  hindsight, determine if he wants to pay the premiums.Â  Effectively, the\r\n  decision circumvents the purpose of insurance and creates a system which would\r\n  allow an insured to retroactively insure himself after an accident or\r\n  loss has occurred. \r\nAccordingly, while I am sensitive to the position of the majority\r\n  to prefer a finding of coverage, neither the policy at issue nor the laws of\r\n  this State support such a finding.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of\r\n  the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Had there been a finding that the policy was\r\n  ambiguous and had the policy in fact been ambiguous, I would concur in the\r\n  result reached by the majority as it would be the policy of this state to\r\n  construe the contract in favor of coverage. \r\n[2] According to the trial courtâ€™s order, the increase in\r\n  premium was due to the addition of a driver to the policy at the request of the\r\n  insured.\r\n[3] The majority cites authority that an insured may rely\r\n  on representations made by an employee of an insurance company as to coverage.Â \r\n  However, these authorities are not analogous to the case at hand because the\r\n  representations were made before any loss or accident had occurred.Â  See Giles v. Gibson, Inc., 285 S.C. 285, 328 S.E.2d 916 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding\r\n  that when an insured specifically requested particular fire coverage and an\r\n  employee, in writing the policy, represented the policy provided such coverage,\r\n  the insurer could not deny coverage when the loss subsequently occurred); Riddle-Duckworth, Inc. v. Sullivan, 253 S.C.\r\n  411, 171 S.E.2d 486 (1969) (holding that an insured was entitled to rely on\r\n  representations that he was â€œfully covered,â€ and accordingly when an accident\r\n  later occurred the insurer could not deny coverage).Â  \r\n[4] Additionally, much of the discussion in Jones,\r\n  concerned Jonesâ€™ claim that the insurer was estopped from denying overage.Â  In\r\n  the case at hand Stinger did not plead estoppel as a basis for asserting\r\n  coverage.Â  Moreover, even had estoppel been plead, Stinger would not be able to\r\n  demonstrate any detrimental reliance as the representation was made to him after the accident had already occurred.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4475","title":"State v.

Parker,\r\n  Jr., (â€œParkerâ€) was convicted of the armed robbery of an Ashepoo grocery store\r\n  and the murder of its employee, English Jack Savage.Â  Parker confessed after\r\n  being apprehended.Â  He appeals his conviction arguing the trial judge erred\r\n  ruling his confession was admissible and by denying his motion for a change of\r\n  venue.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThe events leading\r\n  up to Parkerâ€™s confession occurred primarily on the night of December 26, 2003, and into the morning of December 27, 2003.Â  Parker was wanted by law enforcement in connection to numerous crimes. Â Multiple agencies participated\r\n  in the investigation and manhunt including the highway patrol, the South\r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department,\r\n  and the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.Â  The search utilized\r\n  helicopters and two bloodhound units.Â  Joe Boykin, an ATF agent who testified\r\n  at the Jackson v. Denno hearing, became involved with the pursuit of\r\n  Parker because many of the crimes committed were federal offenses.Â  \r\nAuthorities\r\n  were tipped off that Parker and his co-defendant, Jaquan Ferrell, had stolen a Mercedes\r\n  Benz in Columbia and were traveling towards Colleton County.Â  Interstate 95 was\r\n  shut down for an hour causing a significant back-up of holiday traffic.Â  The\r\n  various law enforcement agencies created a command post by taking over a rest\r\n  area.Â  Parker and Ferrell were spotted in the car and crashed following a high\r\n  speed chase.Â  The pair fled into a wooded area and spent the night without shelter\r\n  or warm clothing as the temperature dipped below freezing.Â  \r\nEarly\r\n  the next morning, Parker and Ferrell were seen running across a dirt road. Â Boykin,\r\n  Investigator Philip Roberson and Officer Hampton Jenkins, both with the\r\n  Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department, responded to the area.Â  They eventually observed\r\n  Parker lying on the ground with his hands under his body.Â  Despite being\r\n  commanded to â€œshow us your hands,â€ Boykin testified Parker refused to obey.Â  After\r\n  Roberson discharged a warning shot, Parker jumped up and ran away.Â  Roberson\r\n  and Jenkins both fired as he fled. Â Boykin opined Roberson was shooting to\r\n  kill.Â  Soon after, bloodhounds tracked Parker and he was tackled during a foot\r\n  chase.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  Parker was apprehended, Boykin estimated there were approximately thirty agents\r\n  and officers on the scene.Â  Â Boykin asked Parker if he was okay and whether he\r\n  needed a doctor.Â  Parker only complained of being cold and was placed in the\r\n  back of a heated police car.Â  Boykin noted that Parker was angry with Roberson for\r\n  having tried to shoot him.Â  He inquired whether Parker would be willing to\r\n  speak with him and if he wanted his father present.Â  Parker responded\r\n  affirmatively to both questions.Â  After being examined and treated at the\r\n  hospital, Parker confessed at the sheriffâ€™s department.Â  The majority of his\r\n  oral confession was videotaped. Â A jury found him guilty, and he was sentenced\r\n  to life imprisonment for murder and thirty years imprisonment for armed\r\n  robbery.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t(1)&nbsp; Did the trial court err in determining Parkerâ€™s statement\r\n  was admissible?\r\n\t(2)&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Parkerâ€™s motion to\r\n  change venue due to pretrial publicity?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 435 (Ct.

Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge determines the admissibility of a statement upon proof of its\r\n  voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  State v.

Von\r\n      Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 242, 471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996).Â Â  â€œIn criminal\r\n  cases, appellate courts are bound by fact finding in response to preliminary\r\n  motions where there has been conflicting testimony or where the findings are\r\n  supported by the evidence and not clearly wrong or controlled by an error of\r\n  law.â€Â  State v.

Â â€œWhen\r\n  reviewing a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning voluntariness, this Court does not\r\n  reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence, but simply determines whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported\r\n  by any evidence.â€Â  Saltz, 346 S.C at 136, 551 S.E.2d at 252; State v.\r\n    Breeze, 379 S.C. 538, 543, 665 S.E.2d 247, 250 (Ct.

Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. 527, 565, 647 S.E.2d 144, 164 (2007) (citing Jackson v Denno,\r\n  378 U.S. 368, 377 (1964)), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 128 S. Ct. 1872, 170 L. Ed. 2d 751 (2008).Â  In State v. Miller, this court instructed:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  process for determining whether a statement is voluntary, and thus admissible,\r\n  is bifurcated; it involves determinations by both the judge and the jury.Â  First,\r\n  the trial judge must conduct an evidentiary hearing, outside the presence of\r\n  the jury, where the State must show the statement was voluntarily made by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed. 2d 908 (1964).Â  If the statement is found to have been given\r\n  voluntarily, it is then submitted to the jury, where its voluntariness must be\r\n  established beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Washington, 296 S.C.\r\n  54, 56, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988).\r\n\r\nMiller, 375 S.C. at 380, 652 S.E.2d at 448; Arrowood,\r\n  375 S.C. at 366, 652 S.E.2d at 442.Â  See also Lego v. Twomey, 404\r\n  U.S. 477, 489 (â€œ[T]he prosecution must prove . . . by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that the confession was voluntary.â€); State v. Smith, 268 S.C. 349,\r\n  354, 234 S.E.2d 19, 21 (1977) (â€œIt has been uniformly held, a confession may be\r\n  introduced upon proof of its voluntariness by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.â€); State v.

Denno hearing to determine the admissibility of\r\n  Parkerâ€™s oral and written statements.Â  The State presented ATF Agent Joe Boykin\r\n  and three members of the Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department:Â  Investigator\r\n  Philip Roberson, former investigator Leslie Jamison, and Investigator Angela\r\n  McAllister Stallings.Â  The judge viewed the videotaped portion of the oral\r\n  confession.\r\nBoykin told the trial judge details concerning how he, as a\r\n  federal agent, came to be involved in the investigation and manhunt.Â  He\r\n  explained he, Roberson and Jenkins spotted Parker in the woods, ordered him to\r\n  show his hands, and that shots were fired as he ran.Â  Parker was eventually\r\n  tackled, handcuffed and placed in a heated police car.Â  In Robersonâ€™s presence,\r\n  Boykin read Parker his Miranda warnings.Â  At the time, Parkerâ€™s main\r\n  complaint was that he was cold. Â Boykin estimated the arrest occurred at seven\r\n  or eight oâ€™clock in the morning. \r\nParkerâ€™s Miranda warnings were given by Boykin a second\r\n  time at the sheriffâ€™s department prior to the questioning, but Boykin had no\r\n  knowledge that a written waiver form was provided.Â  The videotaping was not\r\n  initiated until fifteen to twenty minutes after Parker had been placed in the\r\n  interview room because the equipment was locked in an adjoining office.Â  Boykin\r\n  discussed only â€œgeneralitiesâ€ as they waited for Parkerâ€™s father to arrive.Â  When\r\n  asked to describe Parkerâ€™s physical appearance at the sheriffâ€™s office, Boykin\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tTired.Â  He had been in the woods all night long.Â  It was cold that\r\n  night.Â  But he was certainly more comfortable at that point and time than he\r\n  had been, because it was a cold night.Â  And also he had been scared.Â  He had\r\n  been, you know, hiding from police all night long.Â  But he seemed to be calm.Â \r\n  Or calm, much more calm than having been in the woods all night and with his\r\n  apprehension that occurred previously.Â  And I mean, we spoke easily to each\r\n  other.Â  He didnâ€™t seem apprehensive to talk to me.Â  I was very kind to him.Â \r\n  And spoke respectfully to him.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tAnd I inquired as to his condition.Â  If he was okay.Â  He said he\r\n  was.Â  He was just tired.Â  He had some cuts and some dings from, you know,\r\n  running through the woods the night before.Â  And I had inquired earlier if he\r\n  would like to see his father.Â  And have his father there.Â  And he said yes.Â  So\r\n  I made arrangements to get Mr. Parker, Sr. to come to the sheriffâ€™s\r\n  department.Â  \r\n\r\nBoykin knew Parker had spent time with the Department of Juvenile\r\n  Justice, but was unaware of his intellectual capacity or level of education.Â Â \r\n  He said Parker spoke coherently and did not appear to be under the influence of\r\n  alcohol or intoxicants. Â When Boykin asked if he wanted an attorney, â€œ[Parker]\r\n  said no.Â  He said he was fine.Â  He responded that he would agree to be\r\n  interviewed.Â  And I asked him did he want his father there and he said, yes.â€Â \r\n  Boykin denied being coercive or threatening.Â  He did not make any\r\n  representations that Parker would be tried as a juvenile or an adult or receive\r\n  a life sentence unless he spoke.Â  Although Boykin admitted he did not serve the\r\n  Stateâ€™s arrest warrants for murder or armed robbery, he remembered telling Parker\r\n  he was arrested under state charges, not federal, and was being charged with the\r\n  grocery store robbery.Â  Because the taped confession lasted at least an hour\r\n  and a half, adding on the fifteen to twenty minutes missed before the video equipment\r\n  was activated, Boykin estimated his interview lasted nearly two hours.Â  \r\nAt the Denno hearing, Boykin was cross-examined concerning\r\n  his interrogation techniques:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tIsnâ€™t it true that the particular technique that \r\n\t\t\tyou use is called the [Reid] technique?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI have heard of the [Reid] technique.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve \r\n\t\t\tnever been specifically instructed in the [Reid] technique.&nbsp; I \r\n\t\t\tthink thatâ€™s a school, itâ€™s an advanced school.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve never \r\n\t\t\tgone to it.&nbsp; But I am familiar with it.&nbsp; I mean, Iâ€™ve \r\n\t\t\tfamiliar with some of the, you know, fundamentals I guess.&nbsp; My \r\n\t\t\tâ€“ I mean, my way of interviewing is I always try to be nice to \r\n\t\t\tfolks, you know, and treat them with respect.&nbsp; And I find for \r\n\t\t\tme that gets me a lot further in talking to folks than being \r\n\t\t\tbelligerent or condescending.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tIsnâ€™t it true, Agent Boykin, that the [Reid] \r\n\t\t\ttechnique involves breaking the defendant down first of all?&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAnd then after breaking him down, then you give him some moral \r\n\t\t\tjustification or rationalization?&nbsp; You kind of back him into a \r\n\t\t\tcorner and break him down.&nbsp; And then you back him into a corner \r\n\t\t\twith the, you know, showing him the pictures and the evidence like \r\n\t\t\tyou did between the two.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI am not sure if thatâ€™s all part of the [Reid] \r\n\t\t\ttechnique per se.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd then you give him a morally justified reason \r\n\t\t\tfor what youâ€™re accusing him of doing.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI use that as a technique personally.&nbsp; I use \r\n\t\t\tthe expression of giving somebody an out.&nbsp; I mean thatâ€™s what \r\n\t\t\tyouâ€™re saying basically.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tThatâ€™s part ofâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tItâ€™s hard for somebody to admit when theyâ€™ve done \r\n\t\t\tsomething wrong without any justification.&nbsp; And so a lot of \r\n\t\t\ttimes when I interview folks, I try to craft my questioning in such \r\n\t\t\ta way that, you know, if they want to admit theyâ€™ve done something \r\n\t\t\twrong, to help them make that admission.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tIsnâ€™t it true, Agent Boykin, and when you said, \r\n\t\t\tâ€œRodney [] I know you didnâ€™t mean toâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tRight, I did say that.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\t--to shoot Mr. Savage.&nbsp; I know you didnâ€™t mean \r\n\t\t\tto kill him.â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tRight.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;â€œI know you must have been nervous.&nbsp; I \r\n\t\t\tknow you must have been scared you were going to get shot by all \r\n\t\t\tthat.â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tThat was a deceptive [Reid] technique that is used \r\n\t\t\tto try to involuntarily gain a confession, isnâ€™t that right?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t know about the [Reid] technique per se.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tBut, I mean, I did say that.&nbsp; And I did say it with the hopes \r\n\t\t\tthat I could give Mr. Parker a platform if you will, to admit that \r\n\t\t\the shot Mr. Savage.&nbsp; And I thought it would be easier for him \r\n\t\t\tto come out with the admission if he thought that I thought there \r\n\t\t\twas some justification for it.&nbsp; And that he was not the bad guy \r\n\t\t\tthat he had been portrayed or perceived to be; that maybe there was \r\n\t\t\ta reason that he shot him.&nbsp; Maybe, you know, maybe he was \r\n\t\t\tscared.&nbsp; Maybe he was upset.&nbsp; Maybe Mr. Savage did \r\n\t\t\tsomething that frightened him or upset him and made him shoot.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tBut when I do interviews, you know, I try to create an environment \r\n\t\t\tfor someone to be comfortable with me, to want to talk to me.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAnd in effect, get if off their chest and have an opportunity to \r\n\t\t\tunload.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\tAnd thatâ€™s what I was trying to do with Mr. Parker when I\r\n  interviewed him, is try to put him at ease, and try to give him an out, if you\r\n  will, to make that admission.Â  And thatâ€™s certainly accurate.Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nInvestigator\r\n  Roberson was with Boykin on December 27, 2003, when Parker was given his Miranda warnings in the back of the police car.Â  He first became involved with the\r\n  investigation after being called to the grocery store the night of the robbery\r\n  and shooting.Â  He worked extensively on the case until Parker was arrested.Â \r\n  Roberson participated in the car chase but his vehicle was unable to keep up.Â \r\n  He told the trial judge another officer, Captain Buddy Hill, shot out the\r\n  Mercedesâ€™ windows and tires prior to the wreck.Â  \r\nRobersonâ€™s\r\n  testimony about the efforts made to find Parker in the woods and the subsequent\r\n  arrest corroborated that of Boykin.Â  After spotting Parker, Roberson said he\r\n  refused to show his hands leading him to believe he had a gun.Â  He admitted\r\n  firing twenty-eight rounds as Parker ran away.Â  Roberson never interviewed\r\n  Parker, but, immediately after his arrest, â€œtalked to him to see howâ€”what kind\r\n  of mind set he was in so I would know what we were dealing with when we were\r\n  transporting him.â€Â  He denied telling Parker that he would go to jail for the\r\n  rest of his life.Â  \r\nLeslie\r\n  Jamison, an investigator with the Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department at the\r\n  time of Parkerâ€™s arrest, was the case officer in the murder and armed robbery\r\n  investigation.Â  She was with Boykin at the department when he advised Parker of\r\n  his Miranda rights and conducted the interview.Â  Jamison agreed no\r\n  written waiver of Parkerâ€™s Miranda rights was prepared. Â She stated: (1)\r\n  neither she nor Boykin used threats, coercion, or promises, (2) Parker appeared\r\n  to understand the questions asked during the interview, (3) he did not appear\r\n  to be under the influence of intoxicants or alcohol, and (4) he did not appear\r\n  injured.Â  To the best of her knowledge, Parkerâ€™s statement was given freely and\r\n  voluntarily.Â  \r\nJamison\r\n  explained the arrest warrants were not served until January 9, 2004, because\r\n  Parker was a minor and her supervisor told her to wait.Â  She confirmed Boykin\r\n  talked to Parker subsequent to the hospital visit and asked if he wanted his\r\n  father present.Â  She denied speaking with Parker about his father.Â  Jamison disagreed\r\n  that Parker was interviewed the afternoon following his arrest because he was\r\n  at a vulnerable point.Â  Taking into consideration that Parker had experienced a\r\n  car crash, been shot at, and spent a night in the cold, Jamison opined Parker\r\n  had spent other nights in the woods and been pursued by law enforcement on\r\n  previous occasions.Â  Â Â She did not tell Parker exactly what he was charged with\r\n  or the penalties involved.Â  Although she was aware there would be an attempt to\r\n  try Parker as an adult, she did not communicate this information to him.Â  She\r\n  knew of Parkerâ€™s education level but not that of his father.\r\nColleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department Investigator Angela\r\n  McAllister Stallings took Parkerâ€™s written statement following his interview\r\n  with Boykin.Â  She testified she transcribed the statement as Parker spoke and,\r\n  if he spoke too fast, she would ask him to â€œhold on.â€Â  Although unable to remember\r\n  why she wrote the statement rather than Parker, she asserted the practice was not\r\n  unusual.Â  She confirmed Parker and Ferrell were taken to the hospital to be\r\n  checked for hypothermia after their arrest and prior to their arrival at the\r\n  sheriffâ€™s department.Â  One of them had a foot checked for frostbite.\r\nStallings averred Jamison and Boykin gave Parker his Miranda warnings, but admitted she was not present either time.Â  With custodial\r\n  interviews Stallings initiates, she usually has a written waiver form but conceded\r\n  none was provided to Parker.Â  The written statement began at 3:40 p.m. and concluded at 5:40 p.m.Â  She did not recall Parker crying or hanging his head.Â \r\n  The written statement, which Stallings read at the Denno hearing,\r\n  declared:\r\n\r\n\t[Ferrell] picked me up in a gray ford taurus.Â  It had Orangeburg\r\n  paper tags on it.Â  I thought it was a rental car.Â  We came back to Colleton County.Â  We went to Greed Pond and parked at Woodâ€™s store.Â  We were in the ford taurus.Â \r\n  We walked from Woodâ€™s store to Ashepoo Grocery.Â  We walked behind the store.Â \r\n  We came up on the south side of the building and stood there for awhile to wait\r\n  for the least amount of cars in the parking lot.Â  We went inside.Â  I went\r\n  behind the cash register and pointed the gun at Jack and [Ferrell] pointed his\r\n  gun at a customer.Â  I told Jack to open up the cash register and he started\r\n  yelling the name Lucious.Â  I got scared when he started yelling for him.Â \r\n  Before we went in, [Ferrell] said if he called Lucious, he would come out and\r\n  shoot us.Â  He walked towards me and I backed up and the gun went off.Â  He\r\n  started backing up.Â  I grabbed the register and ran.Â  As [Ferrell] was watching\r\n  the customer, his gun fell apart.Â  After I took the register, we ran out and\r\n  went left, ran behind the store and ran back through the field to the car and\r\n  pulled out on the highway and went right.\r\n\tYesterday we came to Walterboro in the white Benz.Â  A black jeep\r\n  was following us so I pulled off the road.Â  We got to the interstate and got on\r\n  and saw all the black and golds. I pulled over and the black and gold pulled in\r\n  behind me and turned the blue lights on.Â  [Ferrell] said go-go and I took off.Â \r\n  A man shot at me and caused me to wreck.Â  We jumped out and ran into the\r\n  woods.Â  We went and hid and went to sleep.Â  This morning we got up and was\r\n  walking out when [Ferrell] saw the cop car.Â  We ran back in the woods and split\r\n  up.Â  They found us and one shot at me.Â  We ran to another and there were cops\r\n  there with dogs, and they got us.Â  This statement was written by Detective\r\n  McAllister for Rodney Parker.\r\n\r\nParker testified at the Denno hearing.Â  He was sixteen-years-old\r\n  at the time of arrest, had completed the sixth grade, spent four years in the\r\n  Department of Juvenile Justice, and said he had an I.Q. of eighty-four.Â  His\r\n  writing and spelling ability were â€œall right.â€Â Â  In a discussion of the events\r\n  leading up to his arrest, he explained the Mercedes Benz crashed after an\r\n  officer shot the carâ€™s windows and tires.Â  He was not wearing a seatbelt and\r\n  sustained â€œa big gash on my right arm at the top.â€Â  He and Farrell ran into the\r\n  woods and â€œalluded [sic] the bloodhounds by running through water.â€Â  They slept\r\n  very little that night and stayed warm by huddling.Â  As a result of the cold,\r\n  Parker said he had frostbite.Â  During the manhunt, he was scared because â€œit\r\n  was already evident that they were shooting to kill even though I wasnâ€™t\r\n  armed.â€Â  He explained:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI got trapped off.&nbsp; So I was on the ground but \r\n\t\t\tone of my arms was caught in my sleeve.&nbsp; And I was trying to \r\n\t\t\tpull it out.&nbsp; So another officer was telling me to freeze.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI guess I thought he was going to shoot, because he probably thought \r\n\t\t\tI had a gun and I ainâ€™t had\r\n  no gun.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAfter being arrested, Parker did not ask for medical assistance or\r\n  for his father, though he agreed he wanted his father when Boykin made the\r\n  suggestion.Â  He maintained no one told him he had the right to have an attorney\r\n  present, the right to remain silent, nor that anything he said could be used\r\n  against him in court.Â  He confirmed never having been presented with a written\r\n  waiver of his Miranda rights.Â  \r\nParker said he was treated at the hospital for hypothermia and\r\n  frostbitten feet. Â The hospital discharge paper, which reported he was treated\r\n  for neck muscle strain and abrasions, recorded that Parker left the facility at\r\n  1:35 p.m.Â  The interrogation process began immediately upon his arrival at the\r\n  sheriffâ€™s department. Â Â Parker asserted that he was questioned for two or three\r\n  hours before the recording equipment was turned on.Â  However, he agreed he was\r\n  first interviewed and then the written statement began at 3:40 p.m.Â  On re-direct examination he responded affirmatively when his counsel asked, â€œSo what youâ€™re\r\n  saying is, you were questioned about 2 hours before the tape started, which is\r\n  really not out of line, is it?Â  With the total time of 3 and a half hours?â€Â  He\r\n  contended he was crying uncharacteristically and was â€œpretty sure [he] was\r\n  stressed out, emotionally disturbed.â€Â  Before the tape came on, Parker complained\r\n  Boykin told him he could get life in prison:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDid he ever threaten you in any way about that?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tHe never threatened me.&nbsp; He just was like, you \r\n\t\t\tknow, the type of time you are facing.&nbsp; If you donâ€™t tell us \r\n\t\t\tthis, if you donâ€™t tell us that, we are going to give you life in \r\n\t\t\tprison, stuff like that.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nParker\r\n  testified he did not know what he was charged with until January 9, 2004, when the warrants were served.Â  His father arrived approximately twenty minutes after\r\n  the questioning began but never spoke to him privately, recommended getting an\r\n  attorney, nor advised him not to talk to the police.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the Denno hearing, Parker moved to suppress the statement.Â  The trial\r\n  judge denied the motion and determined:\r\n\r\n\tOn the question of voluntariness of the defendantâ€™s statement, I\r\n  put a significantly different interpretation on the evidence than that which\r\n  was argued by [Parkerâ€™s counsel].Â  And there are four questions that I have to\r\n  answer.Â  The first is, did the defendant make this statement.Â  I find the State\r\n  has proven by the preponderance of the evidence that he did.Â  The second\r\n  question is whether or not he was administered his Miranda warnings\r\n  before he was questioned by law enforcement.Â  And I find that the State has\r\n  proven by the preponderance of the evidence that he was.Â  And in doing so, I\r\n  specifically find that the defendantâ€™s testimony on the subject of whether or\r\n  not he was advised of his right to counsel and given his other Miranda warnings is not credible.\r\n\tThe third question is did he knowingly and intelligently waive his\r\n  constitutional rights.Â  And the answer to that question is that the State has\r\n  proven by the preponderance of the evidence that he did.Â  It was argued that\r\n  there was a way in which the defendant had attempted to invoke his right to\r\n  counsel by asking for his father or in some other way.Â  I find specifically\r\n  that at no point during the period of time leading up to the statement that was\r\n  given by the defendant, that has been admitted into evidence for purposes of\r\n  the Mirandaâ€”of the Jackson v. Denno as exhibit No. 1. \r\n\t.\r\n  . . \r\n\tAt no point prior to that statement did the defendant invoke his\r\n  right to counsel.Â  And then the fourth question is, was the statement given\r\n  voluntarily.Â  And I find that the State has proven by the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that the answer to that question is yes.Â  So the State to sum it up,\r\n  the State has proven by the preponderance of the evidence that the answer to\r\n  each of those four questions is yes.Â  The statement is therefore admissible.Â \r\n  And of course it will be up to the jury to determine whether or not the State\r\n  has proven the same answers to each of those questions beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.\r\n\r\nQuestioning\r\n  suspects â€œis often indispensable to crime detection.Â  Its compelling necessity\r\n  has been judicially recognized as its sufficient justification, even in a\r\n  society which, like ours, stands strongly and constitutionally committed to the\r\n  principle that persons accused of crime cannot be made to convict themselves\r\n  out of their own mouths.â€Â  Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 571 (1961).Â  However:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  statement obtained as a result of custodial interrogation is inadmissible\r\n  unless the suspect was advised of and voluntarily waived his or her rights\r\n  under Miranda v.

Â [T]here\r\n  are some cases which discuss, I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re right exactly on point.Â \r\n  But itâ€™s certainly been argued that when you bring somebodyâ€™s parent in or\r\n  trusted adult, or person of that nature, that thatâ€™s tantamount to asking for\r\n  legal counsel.Â  Itâ€™s not the same thing because this person is not trained as\r\n  an attorney.Â  But if you ask somebody, do you want your father here and they\r\n  say yes and heâ€™s a juvenile, thatâ€™s saying that he didnâ€™t want to talk to the\r\n  police. \r\n\r\nA\r\n  juvenileâ€™s request for a parent may be considered when determining the\r\n  voluntariness of his confession.Â  Register, 323 S.C. at 477, 476 S.E.2d\r\n  157 (1996).Â  In Michael C., the United States Supreme Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n\tWhere\r\n  the age and experience of a juvenile indicate that his request for . . . his\r\n  parents is, in fact, an invocation of his right to remain silent, the totality\r\n  approach will allow the court the necessary flexibility to take this into\r\n  account in making a waiver determination.Â  At the same time, that approach\r\n  refrains from imposing rigid restraints on police and courts in dealing with an\r\n  experienced older juvenile with an extensive prior record who knowingly and\r\n  intelligently waives his Fifth Amendment rights and voluntarily consents to\r\n  interrogation. \r\n\r\nId. at 725-26.\r\nAfter\r\n  hearing the testimony and viewing the confession, the trial judge was not\r\n  persuaded by Parkerâ€™s argument that his fatherâ€™s presence represented an\r\n  invocation of Miranda rights.Â  Further, the father was not acting as a\r\n  state agent during the interview when he asked Parker to tell him â€œwhat\r\n  happened.â€Â  See, e.g., Adkins v. Com., 96 S.W.3d 779, 791 (Ky. 2003) (after invoking Miranda rights, in-custody defendant told brother he had\r\n  committed crime after brother encouraged him to take responsibility; brother\r\n  then shared information with officer and court found the confession was not\r\n  caused by police conduct and officer â€œwas not required to bar the jailhouse\r\n  doors simply because he knew that a member of Appellantâ€™s family intended to\r\n  induce him to confess.â€)\r\nParker\r\n  cites an Illinois decision to demonstrate that a juvenileâ€™s statement was\r\n  involuntary when a youth officer was not helpful and his parents were not\r\n  allowed to see the boy during questioning.Â  In re J.J.C., 689 N.E.2d\r\n  1172 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998). Â The case is not persuasive to Parkerâ€™s appeal. Â While\r\n  the lack of guidance from a friendly adult was considered, additional\r\n  circumstances led the Illinois Court of Appeals to deem the confession\r\n  inadmissible.Â  In J.J.C., the juvenile was â€œmore susceptible than the\r\n  general population of sixteen-year-oldsâ€ because of learning disabilities,\r\n  psychiatric disorders, use and misuse of various psychotropic and\r\n  antidepressant medications, and minimal prior police contact.Â  Id. at 1180.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Parker contends he was â€œstressed outâ€ and emotionally distraught from the\r\n  entire ordeal when he was subjected to a three and one half hour interview.Â \r\n  Specifically, he was in a car wreck, shot at by police, exposed overnight to\r\n  the cold, and taken to the hospital.Â  In ruling on the admissibility of\r\n  Parkerâ€™s statements, the trial judge had the opportunity in the Denno hearing to listen to the testimony, assess the demeanor and credibility of the\r\n  witnesses, view the taped portion of the confession, and weigh the evidence\r\n  accordingly.Â  The evidence presented supports the trial courtâ€™s conclusion the\r\n  State met its burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, the\r\n  statement was given freely and voluntarily.Â  Luculently, the admission of\r\n  Parkerâ€™s statement was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Motion to\r\n  Reconsider\r\nParker avers the trial judge erred in denying his motion to\r\n  reconsider the statementâ€™s admissibility and presents two bases for his\r\n  argument.Â  First, Parker claims testimony regarding the fatherâ€™s role in the\r\n  confession was enhanced before the jury.Â  Secondly, he posits Boykinâ€™s trial\r\n  testimony concerning his framing of the shooting as an accident was more expansive\r\n  than that offered in the Denno hearing.Â  \r\nPreliminarily, Parker did not argue to the trial judge that more\r\n  information concerning the father was presented.Â  Consequently, the argument is\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â  â€œHaving failed to raise this issue at trial,\r\n  appellant waived his right to argue it on appeal.â€Â  State v. Bailey, 298\r\n  S.C. 1, 6, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).\r\nAt trial, the following colloquy with Agent Boykin occurred on\r\n  cross-examination:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tIsnâ€™t it true, Agent Boykin, that during the \r\n\t\t\tinterrogation that while Rodney Parker was crying and sobbing and \r\n\t\t\tvisibly upset; that you told him that you knew that he didnâ€™t mean \r\n\t\t\tto shoot Mr. Savage?&nbsp; And you knew it had to be an accident?&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid you say that?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI did suggest that, yes, I did.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tSo you actually, when you said how you believe it \r\n\t\t\twas an accidental shooting?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tNo, sir.&nbsp; I didnâ€™t believe it was accidental \r\n\t\t\tat all.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tSo you actually were misleading, \r\n\t\t\twerenâ€™t you?&nbsp; When you said if you didnâ€™t believe it was an \r\n\t\t\taccidental shooting.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI was deceptive.&nbsp; That was not how I truly \r\n\t\t\tfelt.&nbsp; But again, I was trying to interview him and get him to \r\n\t\t\ttell me the truth about what happened.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe intent of telling him that was to try to elicit \r\n\t\t\ta confession out of him, wasnâ€™t it?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tIt was certainly my intent to [elicit] an admission \r\n\t\t\tfrom him as to what he had done.&nbsp; Yes, sir, that is true.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, Parker asked the judge to\r\n  reconsider the ruling on the admissibility of the confession:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tParker:\r\n\t\t\tI believe that additional information came out from \r\n\t\t\tthis stand that didnâ€™t come out during the Jackson\r\n    v. Denno concerning the confession.Â  Whereby Agent Joe Boykin admitted that\r\n  he intentionally deceived Rodney Parker by saying, you know, I know this was an\r\n  accident.Â  I know you didnâ€™t, you know, mean to shoot Mr. Savage.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt:\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Do you want me in light of this, to \r\n\t\t\treconsider my ruling on the admissibility of the statement?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tParker:\r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.&nbsp; Because he admittedly used and he \r\n\t\t\tadmitted for purposes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCourt: \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;I paid attention to it.&nbsp; And that of \r\n\t\t\tcourse is something you are going to argue to the jury.&nbsp; But \r\n\t\t\tjust like when I ruled on the Denno motion in the first place, I disagree\r\n  with the spin, and I am not, I am not saying that in a critical way, but I\r\n  disagree with the spin that youâ€™re putting on this.Â  Mr. Boykin did admit that\r\n  heâ€”well he admitted what the record reflects he admitted.Â  But I donâ€™t know\r\n  that that changes my view as to whether or not the state has proven by the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence that the statement was made by the defendant;\r\n  that it was made after he had been given his Miranda warnings; that he had\r\n  understood the rights that are included in the Miranda warnings, and that he\r\n  waived those rights and that the statement was made voluntarily.Â  I understand\r\n  thatâ€™s what youâ€™re going to argue.Â  But it does not change, and I listened to\r\n  it all.Â  And I figured you are going to say this when we got to this point.Â \r\n  But it does not change my mind about my answers to those four questions. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed absent a prejudicial\r\n  abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.â€Â  State v. Sheldon,\r\n  344 S.C. 340, 342, 543 S.E.2d 585, 585-86 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Here, the trial\r\n  judge did not err in denying Parkerâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  Boykinâ€™s trial\r\n  testimony was consistent with that given in the Denno hearing.Â  Parker alleges\r\n  significance in Boykinâ€™s admission at trial that he suggested the shooting was\r\n  â€œaccidentalâ€ whereas, at the Denno hearing, he merely reported telling Parker\r\n  he â€œknew he didnâ€™t mean to kill the victim.â€Â  The transcripts reflect Boykin never\r\n  represented that his sympathy was sincere nor offered for any other reason than\r\n  to coax a confession.Â Â  There was no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in\r\n  denying the motion to reconsider where no new information altered his\r\n  conclusion that the State had proven the statement was voluntary by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Change of Venue \r\nParker complains the trial court erred by denying his motion for a\r\n  change of venue based on pre-trial publicity and the victimâ€™s standing in the small\r\n  community.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge observed, â€œyou only moved to strike one or two\r\n  jurors for cause . . . And the only way that I believe I could grant a motion\r\n  for a change of venue is if I had taken out enough jurors for cause to where we\r\n  didnâ€™t have [enough] jurors left to get a jury.Â  That was clearly not a\r\n  problem.â€Â  We agree with Parker this is an incorrect standard for a change of\r\n  venue, and acknowledge the Stateâ€™s contention that the motion was procedurally\r\n  barred.Â  This court, however, is\r\n  â€œauthorized to consider any sustaining ground found within the record.â€Â  Hutto\r\n    v. State, 376 S.C. 77, 654 S.E.2d 846 n.2 (Ct. App. 2007); see also Iâ€™On,\r\n      L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723\r\n  (2000) (â€œThe appellate court may review respondentâ€™s additional reasons and, if\r\n  convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason\r\n  appearing in the record to affirm the lower courtâ€™s judgment.â€); Rule 220(c), SCRCP (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order,\r\n  decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\n\tIn essence, the right to a fair trial guarantees to the criminally\r\n  accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, â€˜indifferentâ€™ jurors.Â  The failure\r\n  to accord an accused a fair hearing violates even the minimal standards of due\r\n  process.Â  â€˜A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due\r\n  process.â€™Â  In the ultimate analysis, only the jury can strip a man of his\r\n  liberty or his life.Â  [A] juror must he as â€˜indifferent as he stands\r\n  unsworne.â€™Â  His verdict must be based upon the evidence developed at the\r\n  trial.Â  This is true, regardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the\r\n  apparent guilt of the offender or the station in life which he occupies.Â  â€˜The\r\n  theory of the law is that a juror who has formed an opinion cannot be\r\n  impartial.â€™Â  \r\n\r\nIrvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 722 (1961) (citations\r\n  omitted); Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466 (1965).\r\nIssues involved in a change of venue motion were recently\r\n  addressed with certitude in State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904\r\n  (2007), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 128 S. Ct. 662, 169 L. Ed. 2d 521\r\n  (2007):\r\n\r\n\tA motion to change venue is addressed to\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 594\r\n  S.E.2d 462 (2004); State v. Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 495 S.E.2d 191 (1997) (finding\r\n  trial court abused discretion by granting the State's motion to change venue\r\n  based on pretrial publicity because no evidentiary facts supported finding of\r\n  actual juror prejudice towards the State). When a trial judge bases the denial\r\n  of a motion for a change of venue because of pretrial publicity upon an\r\n  adequate voir dire examination of the jurors, his decision will\r\n  not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances. Â State v. Caldwell,\r\n  300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990). Â When jurors have been exposed to pretrial\r\n  publicity, a denial of a change of venue is not error where the jurors are found\r\n  to have the ability to set aside any impressions or opinions and render a\r\n  verdict based on the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Tucker, 334\r\n  S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999); Manning, 329 S.C. at 1, 495 S.E.2d at 191.\r\n  Therefore, mere exposure to pretrial publicity does not automatically\r\n  disqualify a prospective juror.Â  Id. The relevant question is not\r\n  whether the community remembered the case, but whether the\r\n  jurors had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially the guilt\r\n  of the defendant.Â  Id. Â It is the defendant's burden to demonstrate\r\n  actual juror prejudice as a result of such publicity.Â  Caldwell, 300\r\n  S.C. at 494, 388 S.E.2d at 816..\r\n\r\nEvins, 373 S.C. at 412-13, 645 S.E.2d at 908.Â  See State v. Longworth, 313 S.C. 360, 438 S.E.2d 219 (1993) (a motion for\r\n  change of venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and\r\n  his ruling will not be disturbed absent abuse).Â  â€œWhen the trial judge bases his ruling upon an adequate voir dire examination of the jurors, his conclusion that the objectivity of the jury\r\n  panel has not been polluted by outside influence will not be disturbed absent\r\n  extraordinary circumstances.â€Â  State v.

Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 (1997), and Patton\r\n    v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025 (1984), for the proposition that pretrial publicity\r\n  may be sufficiently severe to cause the presumption of prejudice in the\r\n  community thus rendering a fair trial impossible.\r\n\r\n\tHowever, in Dowd the Court stated there was no requirement\r\n  that jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case. Â â€œIt\r\n  is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a\r\n  verdict based on the evidence presented in court.â€ Â Dowd, 366 U.S. at 723, 81 S. Ct. at 1632, 6 L.

Â The Court in \r\n\tDowd ultimately concluded that\r\n  the pretrial publicity was unduly prejudicial to the defendant because eight of\r\n  the twelve jurors finally placed in the jury box expressed, during voir dire,\r\n  their belief that the defendant was in fact guilty. \r\n\r\nState v.\r\n  Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 68,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 63, 72 (1998) (finding no error by denying change of venue when nine\r\n  of twelve seated jurors had heard some coverage of case but told judge they\r\n  could set aside what they had heard and decide case on evidence presented); see also State\r\n    v.
