H&H contends: (1) Bufkin's agreement to provide H&H with title\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                         \r\n\r\n\r\ninsurance coverage was not the practice of law requiring an expert witness\r\naffidavit under subsection 15-36-100(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012);\r\nand (2) Bufkin made an oral contract with H&H at closing for coverage as to three\r\nadverse claims. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis case arises out of a real estate transaction involving property purchased by\r\nH&H from Five Star Development, LLC (Five Star) within the Stoney Pointe\r\nsubdivision in Chapin, South Carolina. The property consisted of twenty-six\r\nresidential lots and an 11.44 acre tract.\r\n\r\nBufkin represented H&H and Five Star as the real estate closing attorney at the\r\nJuly 2007 loan closing. In conjunction with the closing, and as a title insurance\r\nagent for Old Republic, Bufkin also issued a title insurance commitment and policy\r\nto H&H. According to Stanley Herlong, a member of H&H, H&H had an oral\r\ncontract with Bufkin as the title agent to: (1) insure H&H would be able to\r\nimmediately sell the builder-ready lots through a listing agreement with Russell\r\nand Jeffcoat Realtors; (2) insure H&H would not be required to pay any Stoney\r\nPointe Homeowners Association (HOA) assessments; and (3) insure H&H would\r\nbe able to immediately sell the 11.44 acre tract without being subject to restrictions\r\nor assessments. Bufkin disputed this claim, maintaining he was never asked by\r\nH&H to act as a title agent and never promised or offered to provide a title\r\ncommitment without any exceptions.\r\n\r\nFollowing the closing, H&H entered into contracts to sell the property. P&K\r\nConstruction (P&K) protested the sale of the property and sought to enforce a\r\ncontract it had with Five Star concerning a right of first refusal. H&H filed a claim\r\nwith Old Republic and paid P&K $25,000 to cancel the contract. In April 2008,\r\nthe HOA filed suit against H&H claiming violations of certain restrictions and\r\ncovenants and failure to pay assessments. H&H settled with the HOA and agreed\r\nto pay $16,300. Additionally, H&H agreed to the imposition of certain restrictive\r\ncovenants on the 11.44 acre tract.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 2010, H&H filed suit against Bufkin and Old Republic asserting breach\r\nof contract and promissory estoppel claims. In its complaint, H&H maintained\r\nBufkin breached his duties as a title insurance agent by failing to explain to H&H\r\nwhat exceptions were included in the title insurance binder, specifically, the HOA\r\nrestrictions and assessments and the right of first refusal contract with P&K. Old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                         \r\n\r\n\r\nRepublic filed an answer on August 5, 2010, denying the allegations in H&H's\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 2010, Bufkin filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the\r\ngrounds that H&H failed to comply with subsection 15-36-100(B), which requires\r\na plaintiff asserting a professional negligence claim against an attorney to file an\r\naffidavit of an expert witness specifying the particular negligent acts or omissions\r\nof the attorney. Following a hearing, the circuit court issued an order in March\r\n2011, holding that \"insofar as the [c]omplaint attempts to assert any claim against\r\nBufkin in his capacity as an attorney, the same is dismissed for failure to state a\r\nclaim pursuant to section 15-36-100.\" Thereafter, Bufkin filed an answer and the\r\nparties engaged in discovery to determine if any of H&H's remaining claims\r\nagainst Bufkin were asserted against him in any capacity other than his capacity as\r\nan attorney.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of discovery, Bufkin filed a motion for summary judgment and\r\nsubsequently an amended motion for summary judgment. The grounds for\r\nBufkin's summary judgment motion included: (1) failure to comply with section\r\n15-36-100; (2) no mutual understanding and intent between the parties sufficient to\r\nform a contract; (3) no promise made by Bufkin to H&H regarding the coverage\r\nexceptions; and (4) no proximate cause because even if the coverage exceptions at\r\nissue had not been listed as exceptions, the title policy would not have covered\r\nH&H's claims. Old Republic also filed a motion for summary judgment asserting\r\nthere was no evidence of an oral contract between the parties.\r\n\r\nFollowing a hearing, the circuit court granted both summary judgment motions on\r\nFebruary 8, 2012. The circuit court found the claims against Bufkin were made in\r\nhis capacity as the real estate closing attorney, and H&H failed to file an expert\r\nwitness affidavit as required by section 15-36-100. Additionally, the court found\r\nthere was no evidence of an oral contract between H&H and Bufkin.\r\nSubsequently, H&H filed a motion to alter or amend which was denied by the\r\ncircuit court. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the\r\nsame standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Fleming v.\r\nRose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). \"Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving\r\nparty must prevail as a matter of law.\" Id. In determining whether a genuine issue\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                          \r\n\r\n\r\nof fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\nAuth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003). \"Once the moving\r\nparty carries its initial burden, the opposing party must come forward with specific\r\nfacts that show there is a genuine issue of fact remaining for trial.\" Sides v.\r\nGreenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 250, 255, 607 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Subsection 15-36-100(B)\r\n\r\nH&H argues the circuit court erred in granting the summary judgment motions\r\nbecause Bufkin's actions in making the oral contract did not involve claims of\r\nprofessional negligence subject to the requirements of subsection 15-36-100(B).\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to subsection 15-36-100(B), when a plaintiff asserts a professional\r\nnegligence claim against an attorney, the plaintiff must file an affidavit of an\r\nexpert witness in support of the complaint specifying particular negligent acts or\r\nomissions of the attorney.\r\n\r\nH&H maintains it is seeking damages due to a breach of contract by Bufkin and\r\nnot on the basis of a failure to disclose by Bufkin as an attorney. H&H argues\r\nBufkin made the oral contract on behalf of Old Republic, the insurer, and\r\ntherefore, Bufkin's actions do not involve claims of professional negligence subject\r\nto the requirements of subsection 15-36-100(B). Bufkin and Old Republic assert\r\nH&H attempts to characterize its suit against Bufkin as something other than a\r\nprofessional malpractice action in order to circumvent the requirements of\r\nsubsection 15-36-100(B).\r\n\r\nWe find Bufkin was acting as an attorney at the closing. First, we note Stanley\r\nHerlong testified he relied on Bufkin as an attorney at the closing and was not\r\naware that Bufkin was an insurance agent for Old Republic. Second, Bufkin gave\r\nhis legal opinion when he made the alleged oral contract with H&H. In its\r\ncomplaint, H&H alleged Bufkin agreed to insure that H&H would: (1) be able to\r\nimmediately sell the builder-ready lots through a listing agreement with Russell\r\nand Jeffcoat Realtors; (2) not be required to pay any HOA assessments; and (3) be\r\nable to immediately sell the 11.44 acre tract without being subject to restrictions or\r\nassessments. We find any advice Bufkin gave H&H regarding potential adverse\r\nclaims constituted the practice of law. See State v. Buyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. 426,\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                          \r\n\r\n\r\n430, 357 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1987) (holding \"[t]he practice of law is not confined to\r\nlitigation, but extends to activities in other fields which entail specialized legal\r\nknowledge and ability.\"); Linder v. Ins. Claims Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477,\r\n493, 560 S.E.2d 612, 621 (2002) (holding \"adjusters shall not . . . [a]dvise clients\r\nof their rights, duties, or privileges under an insurance policy regarding matters\r\nrequiring legal skill or knowledge, i.e., interpret the policy for clients.\").\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the circuit court's grant of Bufkin's summary judgment\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nII.   Existence of an Oral Contract\r\n\r\nH&H argues the circuit court erred in granting the summary judgment motions\r\nbecause there was evidence in the record Bufkin and H&H had an oral contract as\r\nto title insurance coverage. We reverse the circuit court's grant of Old Republic's\r\nsummary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stanley Herlong, H&H had an oral contract with Bufkin as the title\r\nagent to: (1) insure H&H would be able to immediately sell the builder-ready lots\r\nthrough a listing agreement with Russell and Jeffcoat Realtors; (2) insure H&H\r\nwould not be required to pay any HOA assessments; and (3) insure H&H would be\r\nable to immediately sell the 11.44 acre tract without being subject to restrictions or\r\nassessments.\r\n\r\n\"South Carolina common law requires that, in order to have a valid and\r\nenforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties\r\nwith regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.\" Player v.\r\nChandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989).\r\n\r\nBufkin argues H&H failed to prove there was a meeting of the minds necessary for\r\nthe formation of a contract. Bufkin contends Stanley Herlong admitted in his\r\ndeposition that the terms of the alleged oral contract were never discussed and the\r\nonly conversation that took place between H&H and Bufkin regarding title\r\ninsurance was that Bufkin would issue a title insurance policy for approximately\r\n$1,400. Bufkin and Old Republic maintain there were no discussions between the\r\nparties concerning the exceptions in the title insurance policy. H&H argues\r\nStanley Herlong admitted in his affidavit in opposition to the summary judgment\r\nmotions that he discussed the exceptions with Bufkin at or before the closing.\r\nFurther, H&H notes Bufkin stated in his affidavit that he discussed the P&K\r\ncontract with the Herlongs and showed them the title commitment and discussed\r\nthe list of exceptions with them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to H&H, we find a genuine issue\r\nof fact exists as to whether there was an oral contract. There is some evidence of\r\nan oral contract between the parties in the record. Although Stanley Herlong\r\nasserted at his deposition he did not discuss the terms and conditions of the title\r\ninsurance policy with Bufkin, he also stated in his affidavit that H&H had an\r\nagreement with Bufkin regarding the three coverage exceptions. Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the circuit court's determination that there was no evidence of an oral\r\ncontract between H&H and Bufkin. Should H&H prove an oral contract with\r\nBufkin existed, Old Republic can still be liable because Bufkin, as an agent of Old\r\nRepublic, can bind the company. See Holmes v. McKay, 334 S.C. 433, 438, 513\r\nS.E.2d 851, 854 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"Insurance companies are bound by the\r\nrepresentations and acts of their agents acting within the scope of their authority.\").\r\nThus, we reverse the circuit court's grant of Old Republic's summary judgment\r\nmotion and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe affirm the circuit court's grant of Bufkin's summary judgment motion and\r\nreverse the circuit court's grant of Old Republic's summary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: I concur in the majority's\r\ndecision to affirm summary judgment for Bufkin. However, I would also affirm\r\nsummary judgment for Old Republic. To that extent, I dissent.\r\n\r\nAs the majority points out, \"[i]nsurance companies are bound by the\r\nrepresentations and acts of their agents acting within the scope of their authority.\"\r\nHolmes v. McKay, 334 S.C. 433, 438, 513 S.E.2d 851, 854 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nHowever, there is no evidence in this case of any representations or acts by Bufkin.\r\nHerlong's affidavit mentions only things Herlong said and did: \"I asked [Bufkin] to\r\nmake sure I got a copy of\" the P&K contract; \"I told [Bufkin] that I wanted to\r\nmake sure that H&H would not have to sell lots to P&K under any option\r\nagreement and that the purchaser could sell the lots to a third party;\" \"I needed to\r\nmake sure that the purchaser would have protection for any claims of the P&K\r\nCompany or assessments\"; and \"I asked Mr. Bufkin to find\" the P&K contract.\r\nThese statements provide no evidence of any representations or acts by Bufkin.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHerlong also states, \"H&H had an agreement with Mr. Bufkin\" to insure that H&H\r\nwould be able to do certain things and would be protected from P&K's claims.\r\nThis also is not evidence of a representation or act by Bufkin. It is simply a legal\r\nconclusion drawn by Herlong that is insufficient to withstand summary judgment.\r\nSee Rule 56(e), SCRCP (providing responsive affidavits \"must set forth specific\r\nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\"); 10B Charles Alan Wright,\r\nArthur Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2738 (3d ed.\r\n1998) (stating \"ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law . . . cannot be\r\nutilized on a summary-judgment motion\" (quoted in Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C.\r\n58, 68, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003))); Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 516-17, 445\r\nS.E.2d 651, 655 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"A conclusory statement as to the ultimate issue\r\nin a case is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact for purposes of resisting\r\nsummary judgment.\").\r\n\r\nBufkin's affidavit also does not create a genuine issue of material fact. In it,\r\nBufkin states that at the closing, he discussed the P&K contract with\r\nrepresentatives of H&H, showed them the title commitment, and \"discussed the list\r\nof exceptions with them.\" He then states, \"I never promised or offered to provide a\r\ntitle commitment without any exceptions.\" Even viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to H&H, these statements are not evidence of representations or acts by\r\nBufkin that could bind Old Republic to an oral contract. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the majority's finding that \"Bufkin gave his legal opinion when he\r\nmade the alleged oral contract with H&H\" disproves its own conclusion that there\r\nis evidence of an oral contract between H&H and Old Republic. By finding that\r\n\"any advice Bufkin gave H&H regarding potential adverse claims constituted the\r\npractice of law,\" the majority finds—correctly—that Bufkin was providing his\r\nlegal opinion about the outcome of future disputes, not representing to the insured\r\nwhat the terms of the written policy would be.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the circuit court ruled correctly in granting summary judgment to\r\nboth defendants. I would affirm the entire order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5140","title":"Bank of America v.

Henrikson (collectively, Appellants) appeal the master-in-equity's granting\r\nsummary judgment to Bank of America (the Bank), arguing the Bank lacked\r\nstanding because it did not own the loan but was the servicer of the loan. We\r\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 2005, Draper executed a promissory note in the amount of\r\n$245,000 to America's Wholesale Lender. To secure the note, Draper gave a\r\nmortgage to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as nominee\r\nfor America's Wholesale Lender encumbering a piece of real estate in Greenville.\r\nThe note and mortgage state that the lender is America's Wholesale Lender. The\r\nmortgage was recorded with the Greenville County Register of Deeds on August\r\n30, 2005. Freddie Mac, a secondary market investor, funded the loan to Draper.\r\nMERS assigned the loan to Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P.\r\nCountrywide Homes Loans Servicing, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.'s wholly\r\nowned subsidiary, serviced the loan. The note has an indorsement in blank made\r\nby Countrywide Home Loans, doing business as America's Wholesale Lender.\r\nThe Bank acquired Countrywide Home Loans and changed the name of\r\nCountrywide Home Loans Servicing to BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P. In\r\nAugust of 2008, Draper stopped making monthly payments.\r\n\r\nMERS transferred its rights under the mortgage to BAC Home Loans Servicing,\r\nL.P. by an assignment. On December 30, 2010, BAC filed an action for\r\nforeclosure against Appellants1 and others2 it asserted had an interest in the\r\n\r\n1 The complaint stated that Henrikson was made a party for any interest he may\r\nclaim to have in the property by virtue of a private contract dated and recorded\r\nAugust 31, 2009. In his affidavit in opposition to the Bank's motion for summary\r\njudgment, Henrikson states he has occupied the property since September 1, 2009,\r\npursuant to a contract with Draper. According to the Bank, Henrikson has a\r\ncontract to purchase the property from Draper.\r\n2 These others were MERS, acting as nominee for American Home Mortgage, its\r\nsuccessors and assigns; Shawn Kephart; the United States of America, by and\r\n\nproperty seeking a deficiency judgment. Draper filed an answer on March 7, 2011.\r\nOn April 8, 2011, the matter was referred to the master. In his response to BAC's\r\nrequest for admissions, Draper admitted he defaulted on the payments on the note\r\nand mortgage. On July, 1, 2011, BAC merged into the Bank and the Bank became\r\nthe servicer of the loan.\r\n\r\nOn October 3, 2011, the Bank moved for summary judgment, arguing no genuine\r\nissue of material fact existed. The Bank submitted an affidavit from Lisa M. Byers\r\nof the Bank. Attached to the affidavit was the total amount the Bank alleged\r\nDraper currently owed, which included itemized charges for grass cutting and\r\ninspecting the property. Draper submitted an affidavit in opposition to the Bank's\r\nmotion for summary judgment stating \"the Affidavit of . . . Byers . . . is inaccurate\r\nin that numerous expenses claimed by [the Bank] are false and inaccurate,\r\nincluding property inspection fees.\" Henrikson also filed an affidavit in opposition\r\nto the Bank's motion for summary judgment. He stated that he moved into the\r\nproperty in question on September 9, 2009, and no lawn \"re-cuts\" or \"occupied\r\nhome inspections\" had occurred after that date as Byers's affidavit alleged. On\r\nOctober 19, 2011, Henrikson filed a motion for summary judgment, contending the\r\nBank did not own the debt and therefore lacked standing.\r\n\r\nThe master held a hearing on the motions. The Bank argued it held the note and\r\nmortgage and Draper was in arrears in payment on the note in the amount indicated\r\nin the affidavit of debt. On January 24, 2012, the master granted the Bank's motion\r\nfor summary judgment.3 This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not\r\nrequiring the services of a fact finder. George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\nS.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\nmotion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In\r\n\r\nthrough its agency, the Internal Revenue Service; South Carolina Department of \n\r\nRevenue; Branch Banking and Trust Company; and Linkside III Homeowners \n\r\nAssociation, Inc.\n\r\n3 The master denied Henrikson's motion for summary judgment at the hearing.\n\r\n\ndetermining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences drawn from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub. Serv.

The South\r\n\n             Carolina rule with respect to the real party in interest\r\n             requirement is patterned after the comparable federal\r\n             rule, which has been regarded as embodying the concept\r\n             that an action shall be prosecuted \"in the name of the\r\n             party who, by the substantive law, has the right sought to\r\n             be enforced.\" It is ownership of the right sought to be\r\n             enforced which qualifies one as a real party in interest,\r\n             rather than absolute ownership of specific property.\r\n\r\n4 S.C.

D.S.C. 2012).\r\n\r\n             Under South Carolina law one finds the general\r\n             proposition that the plaintiff in a foreclosure suit should\r\n             be the real, beneficial owner of the mortgage debt.\r\n             Despite the statement of the general proposition, it\r\n             appears that foreclosures and motions for relief from the\r\n             stay are frequently brought by parties other than the\r\n             beneficial owner. The court and parties have not found a\r\n             dispositive case under South Carolina law.\r\n\r\n             Other jurisdictions tend to favor the view that a loan\r\n             servicer is a party in interest and a real party in interest.\r\n             The general rule is that a mortgage servicer has standing\r\n             by virtue of its pecuniary interest in collecting payments\r\n             under the terms of the note and mortgage. It seems the\r\n             better view that a loan servicer, with a contractual duty to\r\n             collect payments and foreclose mortgages in the event of\r\n             default, has standing to move for relief from stay in the\r\n             Bankruptcy Court.\r\n\r\nIn re Woodberry, 383 B.R. 373, 379 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2008) (brackets, citations, and\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn a recent case, the South Carolina bankruptcy court found:\r\n\n             As in Woodberry, there is only a mere assertion by\r\n             Debtors that the moving party lacks standing, an\r\n             assertion which is contrary to the entire record of this\r\n             case. . . . [The loan servicer] is the responsible agent for\r\n             receiving payment and acting on the mortgage holder's\r\n             behalf and Debtors are bound by their Plan to pay [the\r\n             loan servicer] for the mortgage. This record is more than\r\n             sufficient proof to find that [the loan servicer] has\r\n             standing to bring the Motion.\r\n\r\nIn re Burretto, CA 05-07146-JW, 2008 WL 8895361, at *2 (Bankr. D.S.C. July 23,\r\n2008).\r\n\r\nIn another bankruptcy court case, the court noted \"there is a general view, which\r\nhas been accepted in this jurisdiction and others, that a loan servicer is a 'party in\r\ninterest' and has standing by virtue of its pecuniary interest in collecting payments\r\nunder the terms of the note and mortgage.\" In re Neals, 459 B.R. 612, 617 (Bankr.\r\nD.S.C. 2011) (citing In re Woodberry, 383 B.R. at 379; In re Miller, 320 B.R. 203,\r\n206 n. 2 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. 2005) (permitting a servicer to litigate motion for relief\r\nfrom stay); In re O'Dell, 268 B.R. 607, 618 (N.D.

Va. 1994) (concluding that both lender and servicer have\r\nstanding to foreclose even if servicer is not the holder of the mortgage); In re\r\nTainan, 48 B.R. 250, 252 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1985) (finding that a mortgage servicer\r\nis a party in interest for purposes of [Rule 17(a), FRCP,] in a relief from stay\r\nproceeding)). The court \"agree[d] with the general view that a loan servicer has\r\nstanding to move for relief from stay.\" Id.\r\n\r\nSeveral bankruptcy courts and federal district courts, including those in South\r\nCarolina, have recognized the servicer of a loan to be a real party in interest and\r\nable to initiate a foreclosure. We agree with this view. Draper acknowledges the\r\nBank is the servicer of his loan. Accordingly, the master correctly found the Bank\r\nhad standing to foreclose on the mortgage.\r\n\nII.    Original Note\r\n\r\nAppellants maintain the master erred in granting the Bank's motion for summary\r\njudgment because the Bank failed to offer any evidence it was the owner or holder\r\nof the mortgage note. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 36-3-301 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) states:\r\n\r\n             \"Person entitled to enforce\" an instrument means (i) the\r\n             holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in possession of\r\n             the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a\r\n             person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled\r\n             to enforce the instrument pursuant to Section 36-3-309 or\r\n             36-3-418(d). A person may be a person entitled to\r\n             enforce the instrument even though the person is not the\r\n             owner of the instrument or is in wrongful possession of\r\n             the instrument.\r\n\r\nA holder is a person in possession of instrument drawn, issued, transferred, or\r\nindorsed to him. S.C. Code Ann. § 36-1-201(20) (2003). \"[A]n instrument is paid\r\nto the extent payment is made by or on behalf of a party obliged to pay the\r\ninstrument, and to a person entitled to enforce the instrument.\" S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n36-3-602(a) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n\"A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine\r\nquestion is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it\r\nwould be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.\" Rule 1003, SCRE.\r\n\r\nDraper originally executed the note to America's Wholesale Lender. Through a\r\nseries of transfers and mergers, the Bank became the holder of the note.\r\nAppellants do not dispute these transfers and mergers. BAC asserted when it filed\r\nthe foreclosure action that it was the holder of the note and mortgage. The Bank\r\nasserted the same at the summary judgment hearing. The Bank produced a copy of\r\nthe note, which shows the indorsement by Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. doing\r\nbusiness as America's Wholesale Lender. The Bank produced a ledger of\r\npayments, prepared on April 6, 2011, showing all transactions on the account\r\nbeginning on September 1, 2005. Because the evidence indicates the Bank did\r\nhold the note, the master did not err in granting summary judgment on this issue.\r\n\nIII.   Opposing Affidavits\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in granting the Bank's motion for summary\r\njudgment because the Bank's affidavit for damages was contradicted by opposing\r\naffidavits thereby creating a question on fact. They maintain the affidavit from\r\nByers was inaccurate because it stated there were property inspection fees and\r\ncharges for the lawn being recut, which Henrikson disputes because he was living\r\non the property at the time they allegedly occurred. We agree in part.\r\n\r\n\"The rule governing summary judgment provides that '[s]upporting and opposing\r\naffidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as\r\nwould be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is\r\ncompetent to testify to the matters stated therein.'\" Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58,\r\n64, 580 S.E.2d 433, 436 (2003) (quoting Rule 56(e), SCRCP) (alteration and\r\nemphasis added by court).\r\n\r\nThere is a material question of fact but only in regards to the charges in the\r\naffidavit that occurred after September 9, 2011, for inspections and lawn cutting.\r\nThose charges totaled $375 for lawn cutting and $170 for inspections, amounting\r\nto $545. Henrikson lived in the house at the time of the charges and his affidavit\r\nindicating those inspections and law cutting did not occur raised an issue of\r\nmaterial fact. However, because Appellants have not provided any evidence to\r\ndispute the other charges, this does not raise an issue of credibility to the entire\r\namount of charges. Accordingly, the master's grant of summary judgment as to\r\nonly this part is reversed and remanded for a decision on the charges for grass\r\ncutting and inspections after September 9, 2011.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe master correctly granted the Bank's motion for summary judgment in regards\r\nto the issue of standing and the issue of the original note. However, Appellants\r\nraised an issue of material fact as to the amount due to the Bank. Therefore, the\r\nmaster's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5095","title":"Town of Arcadia Lakes v.

We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent Roper Pond, LLC (Roper) is the owner and developer of 12.75 acres\r\nof real property on Trenholm Road in an unincorporated area of Richland County.\r\nThe property includes 1.8 acres consisting of wetlands and waters that were\r\nidentified by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in 2005 as falling\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA).1 These\r\njurisdictional wetlands include Roper Pond, a man-made pond that is visible from\r\nTrenholm Road but wholly within the boundaries of Roper's property. Before\r\nimplementation of the project at issue in this appeal, water lilies covered the\r\nsurface of Roper Pond.\r\n\r\nRoper Pond drains through a pipe that runs beneath Trenholm Road and into Cary\r\nLake. Cary Lake is privately owned by the Cary Lake Homeowners Association,\r\nwhich is not a party to this litigation. Although Cary Lake lies partly within the\r\nboundaries of the Town, the Town has no ownership interest in it and is not\r\nresponsible for its maintenance or remediation.\r\n\r\nIn August 2007, Roper submitted to the Corps its initial plans for a multifamily\r\napartment development to be built on its property. As part of this undertaking,\r\nRoper needed a permit for stormwater discharges from land-disturbing activities\r\nassociated with the project. See S.C. Code Ann. § 48-14-30(A) (2008) (prohibiting\r\nland-disturbing activities without the submission of a stormwater management and\r\nsediment control plan to the appropriate agency and a permit to proceed with these\r\nactivities); 9 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 72-305 (Supp. 2012) (stating similar\r\nprohibitions to section 48-14-30(A) and setting out the permit application and\r\napproval process).\r\n\r\nTo expedite matters, Roper could \"seek coverage under a promulgated storm water\r\ngeneral permit\" instead of obtaining an individual permit. See 3 S.C. Code Ann.\r\n\r\n1   33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. (2006).\r\n\nRegs. 61-9.122.26(c)(1) (2012) (\"Dischargers of storm water associated with\r\nindustrial activity and with small construction activity are required to apply for an\r\nindividual permit or seek coverage under a promulgated storm water general\r\npermit.\"). Under 3 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-9.122.28 (2012), DHEC is authorized\r\nto issue general permits for stormwater discharges from projects that meet certain\r\ncriteria. Pursuant to this authority, DHEC issued Permit Number SCR100000\r\n(State General Permit) on August 1, 2006. The State General Permit, which\r\nDHEC described as an \"NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges from\r\nLarge and Small Construction\"2 covered discharges from the commencement of an\r\nauthorized project until final stabilization of the construction site.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, DHEC published a Guidance Document for the State General Permit\r\nadvising prospective permittees about the need to obtain necessary permits from\r\nthe Corps. In this particular case, Roper was required under section 404 of the\r\nCWA to obtain a wetlands permit from the Corps because it intended to fill some\r\nof the jurisdictional wetlands on the project site. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a) (2006)\r\n(authorizing the Corps to issue permits \"for the discharge of dredged or fill\r\nmaterial into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites\").\r\n\r\nUnder section 404(e) of the CWA, the Secretary of the Army is authorized to issue\r\nNationwide Permits (NWPs) for any category of similar activities involving\r\ndischarges of dredged or fill material determined to \"cause only minimal adverse\r\nenvironmental effects when performed separately\" and to \"have only minimal\r\ncumulative adverse effect [sic] on the environment.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(1)\r\n(2006). If a proposed activity meets the applicable regional and general conditions\r\nfor an NWP, application for its authorization can proceed more quickly than it\r\nwould if the applicant sought an individual permit. On March 12, 2007, the Corps\r\nissued NWP 29 and NWP 39, the two NWPs at issue in the present litigation.\r\nNWP 29 applied to residential developments, and NWP 39 applied to commercial\r\nand institutional developments.\r\n\r\nThe requirement for a 404 permit from the Corps in turn triggers a requirement\r\nunder section 401 of the Clean Water Act for water quality certification that any\r\ndischarge into navigable waters is consistent with federal and state water quality\r\n\r\n\r\n2 As authorized by the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge\r\nElimination System (NPDES) Permit Program controls water pollution by\r\nregulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States.\r\nThe program is administered by authorized states, including South Carolina.\r\n\nstandards (401 certification). 401 certification is required \"from the State in which\r\nthe discharge originates or will originate.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1) (2006).3 On\r\nMay 11, 2007, pursuant to its regulatory authority, DHEC issued 401 certifications\r\nfor projects covered under NWP 29 and NWP 39.4 DHEC 401 certifications for all\r\nNWPs included general conditions that a given project must meet, including the\r\nrequirement that DHEC, in reviewing a project for which coverage under an NWP\r\nis sought, would consider not only the land area directly impacted by each NWP\r\nrequest, but also impacts to adjacent water bodies or wetlands resulting from the\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 2008, George Whatley, a wetland scientist for BP Barber, submitted a\r\njoint federal and state application for the proposed construction project on Roper's\r\nproperty. On the application, Whatley noted the project would involve the filling\r\nof 0.075 acres of jurisdictional wetlands.5 On May 5, 2008, Whatley submitted a\r\n\r\n\r\n3 DHEC regulations reference this requirement as well. See 8 S.C. Ann. Regs. 61-\r\n101.A.2 (2012) (stating federal law requires an applicant for a federal permit to\r\nconduct an activity that \"during construction or operation may result in any\r\ndischarge to navigable waters\" \"to first obtain a certification from [DHEC]\" and\r\nstating that \"Federal law provides that no Federal license or permit is to be granted\r\nuntil such certification is obtained\").\r\n4 See 8 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101.A.3 (2012) (\"[DHEC] may issue, deny, or\r\nrevoke general certifications for categories of activities or for activities specific in\r\nFederal nationwide or general dredge and fill permits pursuant to Federal law or\r\nregulations.\"); 33 C.F.R. § 330.4(c)(1) (2013) (\"State 401 water quality\r\ncertification pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act, or waiver thereof, is\r\nrequired prior to the issuance or reissuance of NWPs authorizing activities which\r\nmay result in a discharge into waters of the United States.\").\r\n5 As noted earlier, the CWA requires a 404 permit for certain discharges of\r\ndredged or fill material into navigable waters. The term \"navigable waters\" is\r\ndefined in the CWA as \"waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\"\r\n33 U.S.C. § 1362(7) (2006). The United States Supreme Court has imposed\r\nlimitations on the inclusion of wetlands, holding that \"only those wetlands with a\r\ncontinuous surface connection to bodies that are 'waters of the United States' in\r\ntheir own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between 'waters' and\r\nwetlands, are 'adjacent to' such waters and covered by the [CWA].\" Rapanos v.\r\nU.S., 547 U.S. 715, 742 (2006) (emphasis in original). In the present case, the\r\n\npre-construction notification (PCN) to the Corps. In the PCN, Whatley noted: (1)\r\nalthough Roper initially advised the Corps in 2007 that the project would impact\r\n0.099 acres of jurisdictional wetlands, the project was redesigned to reduce impacts\r\nto 0.075 acres and (2) \"best management practices\" (BMPs) would be implemented\r\nto ensure that construction activities would not impact jurisdictional areas lying\r\noutside the permitted impact areas. Whatley further requested that the Corps\r\nreview the project for possible coverage under an NWP; however, he did not\r\nspecify any particular NWP under which the activity would be conducted.\r\n\r\nNo other impacts to water quality were disclosed on the application; however,\r\naccording to subsequent e-mails between BP Barber and the Corps, Whatley\r\nnotified the Corps that the project included lowering the elevation of Roper Pond\r\nand the discharge of the soil and sediment from the bottom of the pond into an\r\nupland area. According to the e-mails, Whatley inquired whether either of these\r\nwas an impact to be considered in obtaining approval for the construction, and the\r\nCorps advised: (1) lowering the pond was not an impact and (2) excavation of the\r\npond would be exempt from permitting requirements provided the excavated\r\nmaterial was \"placed in a truck or deposited onto uplands\" and there was \"[n]o\r\ndouble handling or stockpiling in jurisdictional areas.\"\r\n\r\nPursuant to the requirements for coverage under the State General Permit, a\r\nStormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) was prepared for the project on\r\nJune 26, 2008. DHEC reviewed the SWPPP and requested certain revisions.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated September 9, 2008, the Corps advised Whatley: (1) it reviewed the\r\nPCN and determined the proposed activity would \"result in minimal individual and\r\ncumulative adverse environmental effects and [was] not contrary to public\r\ninterest\"; (2) the activity met the terms and conditions of NWP 39; and (3) for\r\nauthorization to remain valid, the project had to comply with general conditions of\r\nthe NWP, regional conditions, and certain special conditions, namely, that Roper\r\nobtain and provide the Corps with \"all appropriate state certifications and/or\r\nauthorizations (i.e. 401 Water Quality Certification, Coastal Zone Management\r\nConsistency Determination, State Navigable Waters Permit).\" Consistent with its\r\nusual practice, the Corps sent a copy of the September 9, 2008 letter to DHEC as\r\nwell as to Whatley.\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 2008, Roper submitted to DHEC a notice of intent (NOI) to\r\ndischarge storm water associated with its proposed project, now designated as\r\n\r\nparties do not dispute that the 0.075 acres of wetlands to be filled in conjunction\r\nwith Roper's proposed project were \"jurisdictional wetlands\" subject to the CWA.\r\n\nRoper Pond Apartments, seeking approval from DHEC to have the stormwater\r\ndischarges covered under the State General Permit.6 According to the NOI, the\r\nproject site was 12.8 acres, of which 9.9 acres would be disturbed by land-clearing\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nDHEC responded to Whatley by letter dated October 2, 2008, advising it\r\ndetermined that the impacts of the project on water quality would be minimal and\r\nthat the proposed work would be consistent with the 401 certification issued in\r\n2007 for NWP 39, subject to various conditions not at issue in this appeal.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2008, DHEC staff engineer Jill Stewart e-mailed BP Barber to\r\nexpress various concerns. Among these concerns was information she received\r\nthat the proposed plans for Roper Pond Apartments included lowering of the water\r\nsurface elevation of Roper Pond to allow for detention of post-development runoff\r\nof stormwater. Stewart inquired whether the dropping of the water surface\r\nelevation should be taken into account in determining if a site is eligible for\r\ncoverage under NWP 39. BP Barber responded the following day, informing\r\nStewart that its wetlands consultant advised \"the lowering of the water surface\r\nelevation is included and covered under [NWP 39].\"\r\n\r\nIn December 2008, DHEC issued a letter acknowledging it was satisfied that the\r\nrevised SWPPP met the requirements of the State General Permit and the\r\napplicable regulations. On December 15, 2008, DHEC staff granted Roper\r\ncoverage under the State General Permit for its stormwater discharges associated\r\nwith construction of Roper Pond Apartments.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated December 30, 2008, Appellants and other individuals requested that\r\nthe DHEC Board review and overturn the decision.7 Among the technical issues\r\nraised in the letter were Roper's failure to disclose its intent to lower the elevation\r\nof Roper Pond and an allegation that it sought coverage under the wrong NWP.\r\nOn January 14, 2009, DHEC responded to the letter, informing Appellants that the\r\nBoard declined to conduct a final review conference and that anyone aggrieved by\r\nthe decision could request a contested case hearing in the ALC. On February 16,\r\n2009, Appellants filed a request for a contested case hearing in the ALC.\r\n\r\n6The NOI was on a DHEC form entitled \"Notice of Intent (NOI) for Stormwater\r\nDischarges from Large and Small Construction Activities, NPDES General Permit\r\nSCR100000.\"\r\n7 Additional facts about Appellants will be presented in the LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nsection of this opinion.\r\n\nMeanwhile, on January 6, 2009, Whatley e-mailed the Corps requesting a\r\ncorrected letter indicating the impacts of the project would be covered under NWP\r\n29 instead of NWP 39. As noted earlier, Whatley also recounted Roper's plans to\r\nlower the elevation of Roper Pond and its intent to remove the excavated material\r\nto an upland area and his understanding that Roper did not need approval from the\r\nCorps for these activities. By letter to Whatley dated February 25, 2009, the Corps\r\nadvised that it determined the proposed activity would result in minimal individual\r\nand cumulative adverse environmental effects, would not be contrary to the public\r\ninterest, and met the terms and conditions of NWP 29. Except for the particular\r\nNWP referenced, the language in the February 25, 2009 letter was identical to the\r\ncorresponding language in its September 9, 2008 letter.\r\n\r\nAs it did with the September 9, 2008 letter, the Corps sent a copy of its February\r\n25, 2009 verification letter to DHEC. DHEC, however, did not issue another\r\nauthorization letter advising Roper that the project would be consistent with the\r\n401 certification issued in 2007 for NWP 29. According to Charles Hightower,\r\nDHEC's Section Manager of the 401 Wetlands Section, the purpose of such\r\nnotification from DHEC is to provide an applicant assurance that the applicant's\r\nproposed project falls within the conditions of DHEC's 401 certification.\r\nHightower further testified that Roper's proposed fill of the 0.075 acres of\r\njurisdictional wetlands satisfied the necessary conditions to receive 401 water\r\nquality certifications for both NWP 29 and NWP 39 and that because the requisite\r\nconditions had been met, Roper did not need to notify DHEC before proceeding\r\nwith the project under NWP 29.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 2009, in response to a motion by Roper to dismiss Appellants' request\r\nfor a contested case hearing, the ALC issued a consent order in which the parties\r\nagreed to the dismissal of all claims raised by Appellants challenging the 401\r\ncertification and authorization to conduct activities under NWP 39 for the proposed\r\ndevelopment. The partial dismissal did not affect Appellants' claims and Roper's\r\ndefenses in connection with the 401 certification and authorization under NWP 29 .\r\n\r\nThe contested case hearing before the ALC took place on September 3 and 4,\r\n2009. Stewart, Hightower, Whatley, and several individual Appellants testified.\r\nThe record on appeal also includes depositions from various individuals, including\r\nStewart and Hightower. In addition, Appellants called Seth Reice, Ph.D., a\r\nprofessor of ecology and biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel\r\nHill, as an expert on aquatic ecology. Although Reice admitted he previously\r\nopined that the proposed excavation of the Pond would have disastrous\r\nconsequences, he now admitted this was only conjecture. Furthermore, Reice's\r\nprimary interest was sedimentation, and he admitted he had no direct experience\r\n\nwith excavation. When asked if he believed the land-disturbing activities\r\nconducted in conjunction with Roper Pond Apartments would have an adverse\r\nimpact on Roper Pond, Reice stated only that \"[i]t doesn't sound good\" and he\r\nwould \"be surprised if they didn't,\" but declined to offer an expert opinion about\r\nthe probable results. On cross-examination, Reice also stated he was not provided\r\ncopies of Roper's SWPPP and except for what he heard at the hearing, had no\r\nknowledge of the BMPs that Roper intended to follow in order to minimize the\r\nimpact of its construction activities.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2010, the ALC issued a final order upholding DHEC's approval of\r\ncoverage under the State General Permit on the merits and further finding that\r\nAppellants lacked standing to challenge DHEC's decision. On March 23, 2010,\r\nfollowing a hearing on a motion for stay by Appellants, the ALC temporarily\r\nstayed its final order pending a decision on Appellants' motion for reconsideration.\r\n\r\nBy order dated April 1, 2010, the ALC denied Appellants' motion to reconsider and\r\nlifted the temporary stay. Appellants then filed their notice of appeal to this court.\r\n\r\nISSUES8\r\n\r\nI. Did the ALC err in finding Appellants lacked standing to challenge DHEC's\r\ndecision to authorize coverage for Roper Pond Apartments under the State General\r\nPermit?\r\n\r\nII. Did the ALC err in holding the 401 certification issued by DHEC was sufficient\r\nfor a valid 404 permit and coverage under the State General Permit?\r\n\r\nIII. Did the ALC err in holding that Roper's proposed stormwater control activities\r\ncould be covered under the State General Permit?\r\n\r\n\r\n8 The Home Builders Association of South Carolina has filed an amicus curiae\r\nbrief asserting that Appellants seek to add an unnecessary step in stormwater\r\nregulation and nationwide permitting that would have adverse consequences for\r\nthe construction industry, the housing market, and the public at large and that\r\nexisting programs and regulations sufficiently protect the public interest in the\r\npermitting process. Because our rulings on the issues Appellants have presented\r\nare dispositive of this appeal, we decline to address these policy concerns. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\nits disposition of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review that an appellate court is to apply to appeals from the ALC\r\nis set forth in the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA),\r\nspecifically in section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012).

Under section 1-23-610(B), a reviewing court may reverse or modify\r\na decision by the ALC if the substantive rights of the appellant have been\r\nprejudiced because of a finding, conclusion, or decision that: (1) violates\r\nconstitutional or statutory provisions; (2) exceeds the agency's statutory authority;\r\n(3) is made upon unlawful procedure; (4) is affected by other error of law; (5) is\r\nclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the\r\nwhole record; or (6) is arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by either abuse of\r\ndiscretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. Section 1-23-610 has\r\nbeen applied not only to findings by the ALC on the merits of a controversy but\r\nalso to findings by the ALC concerning a party's standing to maintain an action.\r\nSee Bailey v.

South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources, 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001),\r\nthe Supreme Court of South Carolina, quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\r\nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992), set forth three requirements that must be met to satisfy\r\n\"the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\":\r\n\r\n             First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in\r\n             fact\"—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is\r\n             (a) concrete and particularized and (b) \"actual or\r\n             imminent, not \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical.\" Second,\r\n             there must be a causal connection between the injury and\r\n             the conduct complained of—the injury has to be \"fairly\r\n             trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and\r\n             not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some\r\n             third party not before the court.\" Third, it must be\r\n             \"likely,\" as opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the\r\n             injury will be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\r\n\r\n(Citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\"The party seeking to establish standing carries the burden of demonstrating each\r\nof the three elements.\" Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 601, 550 S.E.2d at 291. \"At the\r\npleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's\r\nconduct may suffice\" to withstand a motion to dismiss. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\r\nElements of standing, however, \"are not mere pleading requirements but rather an\r\nindispensable part of the plaintiff's case\"; therefore, \"each element must be\r\nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the\r\n\r\n11 The ALC did not consider whether the \"public importance\" exception could\r\nconfer standing on any of the Appellants, and Appellants have not raised this\r\nexception in their brief. See Davis v. Richland Cnty. Council, 372 S.C. 497, 500,\r\n642 S.E.2d 740, 741 (2007) (\"[S]standing may be conferred upon a party when an\r\nissue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.\").\r\n\nburden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the\r\nsuccessive stage of the litigation.\" Id. (quoted in Beaufort Cnty. v. Trask, 349 S.C.\r\n522, 528 n.14, 563 S.E.2d 660, 663 n.14 (Ct. App. 2002)).\r\n\r\nA. The Town\r\n\r\nThe ALC found the Town did not satisfy the first element required to establish\r\nstanding, namely, that it had a personal stake in the litigation. Quoting Glaze v.\r\nGrooms, 324 S.C. 249, 255, 478 S.E.2d 841, 845 (1996), the ALC referenced the\r\ngeneral rule that \"a municipality must allege an infringement of its own proprietary\r\ninterests or statutory rights to establish standing.\" In response to this statement,\r\nAppellants advocate a broad interpretation of the term \"proprietary interest\" in\r\ndetermining whether the Town has demonstrated an injury in fact sufficient to\r\nconfer standing. In the present case, Appellants argue \"proprietary interests\"\r\ninclude: (1) the Town's interest in protecting the environmental quality of Cary\r\nLake, which lies partly within the Town borders; (2) the Town's ability to comply\r\nwith federal law, such as NPDES regulations; (3) the Town's interest in\r\nmaintaining its character and desirable attributes, including its aesthetic appeal:\r\nand (4) the diminution of property values within the Town and other adverse\r\neffects of a nearby apartment complex on such concerns as security and traffic\r\ncongestion. We hold that none of these professed interests, whether \"proprietary\"\r\nor not, are sufficient to confer standing on the Town in this case.\r\n\r\nAs to the first two concerns, Town Mayor Richard Thomas testified in a deposition\r\nthat the Town had no ownership interest in Cary Lake. Mayor Thomas gave a\r\nbrief statement that under NPDES regulations, the Town was responsible for water\r\nthat flowed out of Cary Lake, but provided no supporting authority for this\r\nassertion.12 Moreover, he acknowledged the Town is not responsible for the\r\n\r\n\r\n12 In their reply brief, Appellants cite title 33, section 1342(p) of the United States\r\nCode (2006), which the United States Congress added to the CWA in 1987. This\r\nsection covers municipal and industrial stormwater discharges. Under paragraph\r\n(4) of this section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is\r\nrequired to establish regulations setting forth permit application requirements for\r\ndischarges from municipal separate stormwater systems and either the\r\nAdministrator or appropriate State agency would eventually acquire the authority\r\nto issue and deny such permits. We have found nothing in this section either\r\nrequiring a municipality to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from a\r\nstormwater system that is already covered by a permit or holding a municipality\r\nresponsible for such discharges.\r\n\nmaintenance of Cary Lake, has never allocated funds for this purpose, and has\r\nnever incurred any fines under NPDES regulations despite alleged problems in the\r\npast with water flowing into Cary Lake. He also stated that Cary Lake is the\r\n\"bottom lake,\" that is, the final lake into which the remaining six lakes flow. We\r\nalso find significant the absence of any evidence from Appellants that the BMPs to\r\nbe implemented under the SWPPP were inadequate to prevent sediment from\r\nleaving the construction site; thus, Appellants have also failed to show their alleged\r\ninjuries are \"fairly traceable\" to the challenged action in this case. Similarly,\r\nAppellants have not shown any causal connection between the authorization of\r\ncoverage to Roper for land-disturbing activities under the State General Permit and\r\neither of their two remaining concerns. Therefore, pursuant to section 1-23-610,\r\nwe affirm the ALC's determination that the Town lacks standing.\r\n\r\nB. Kaminer Station Appellants\r\n\r\nThe ALC found the Kaminer Station Appellants failed to establish either an injury\r\nin fact from the permitting decision or a causal connection between the challenged\r\ndecision and their alleged injuries. We agree with the ALC to the extent that it\r\nfound that Appellants have failed to establish any injury that would be traceable to\r\nthe permitting decision.\r\n\r\nLinda Jackson, one of the Kaminer Station Appellants, conceded that \"water flows\r\ndown\" and there was no serious concern that stormwater from Roper Pond would\r\nflow uphill to Kaminer Station. However, Jackson also described the visual appeal\r\nof Roper Pond and her appreciation of the nature sounds in the area. She also\r\ntestified that she had fished on Cary Lake and had seen changes for the worse in\r\nthat area as it developed. Such observations, even if shared by many others,\r\narguably can still form the basis for a concrete and particularized injury that would\r\nconfer standing. See Pye v. U.S., 269 F.3d 459, 469 (4th Cir. 2001) (\"[M]erely\r\nbecause an injury is widely held does not necessarily render it abstract and thus not\r\njudicially cognizable. . . . So long as the plaintiff himself has a concrete and\r\nparticularized injury, it does not matter that legions of other persons have the same\r\ninjury.\"). Moreover, even those concerns reflecting aesthetic or recreational\r\ninterests have been recognized as \"judicially cognizable injur[ies] in fact.\" Sea\r\nPines, 345 S.C. at 602, 550 S.E.2d at 292. Nonetheless, when such interests\r\ninvolve property that is privately owned by a party other than the plaintiff, the\r\npresence of an injury in fact cannot be assumed. Cf. Conservation Council of N.C.\r\nv. Costanzo, 505 F.2d 498, 501-02 (4th Cir. 1974) (stating the plaintiffs'\r\n\nrecreational use of privately owned property as either licensees or trespassers did\r\nnot confer standing to challenge development on that property because there was\r\nno evidence that the owner of the property would allow such use to continue in the\r\nfuture). Here, the affected bodies of water, Roper Pond and Cary Lake, are\r\nprivately owned by parties other than Appellants.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we hold substantial evidence supports the ALC's determination that\r\nthe Kaminer Station Appellants have not established a causal connection between\r\ntheir alleged injuries and the conduct giving rise to their complaint. When Roper's\r\nattorney asked Jackson to explain the injuries she would suffer if the land-\r\ndisturbing activities for which coverage under the State General Permit was\r\ngranted were managed properly, she responded only that \"we don't know how it's\r\ngoing to be managed.\" Jackson also conceded that much of her dissatisfaction\r\nwith prior construction in the area was due to violations of the applicable permits\r\nrather than the permits themselves. Furthermore, Reice's inability to offer a\r\ndefinitive opinion about the impact of the dredging of the pond supports the ALC's\r\nfinding that the Kaminer Station Appellants have failed to meet the second\r\nrequirement for standing.\r\n\r\nC. Cary Lake Appellants\r\n\r\nFinally, we agree with the ALC that the Cary Lake Appellants failed to show that\r\ngranting coverage for Roper Pond Apartments under the State General Permit\r\nwould cause an actual or imminent injury and therefore lacked standing to\r\nchallenge DHEC's decision to grant coverage under the State General Permit.\r\n\r\nTestifying for the Cary Lake Appellants, Elaine Starr stated her home, where she\r\nhas lived since 1971, borders Cary Lake, which is on the opposite side of\r\nTrenholm Road from Roper Pond. She further testified that she had a bachelor's\r\ndegree in biology and had done graduate work in wetlands and coastal resources.\r\nShe had participated in several organizations that were concerned with water\r\nquality, and she and her family have made extensive use of Cary Lake for\r\nrecreational purposes. Starr testified about her empirical observations of the\r\ndecline in the water quality of Cary Lake and how these observations were\r\nsupported by her use of a Secchi disk, a technique to measure water clarity. She\r\nalso expressed concerns about the possible demise of the water lilies due to the\r\ndredging of Roper Pond, noting \"if their [rhizomes] or root systems get damaged or\r\ntaken way, . . . they may not be there.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Starr, the increased sedimentation in Cary Lake that she described\r\nresulted from prior occurrences involving possible mismanagement. However,\r\n\nthere was no evidence that the project at issue here would lead to similar results.\r\nStarr admitted she had not reviewed the SWPPP for the proposed project and was\r\nunable to offer any specific challenge to DHEC's determination that the SWPPP\r\nwas not, under the terms of the State General Permit, a sufficient precaution\r\nagainst the consequences she claimed would result from the building of Roper\r\nPond Apartments. Finally, similar to what we noted in our discussion about the\r\nKaminer Station Appellants, the complaints of the Cary Lake Appellants primarily\r\nconcern Roper Pond and Cary Lake, both of which are privately owned and\r\nmaintained by parties other than Appellants, and are thus not injuries in fact. We\r\ntherefore agree with the ALC that the Cary Lake Appellants presented at best only\r\nspeculative evidence that they would suffer an injury in fact from DHEC's decision\r\nto allow Roper Pond Apartments to be covered under the State General Permit.\r\n\r\nII. Validity of the 401 Certification\r\n\r\nAppellants further argue the 401 certification issued by DHEC was insufficient to\r\nsatisfy the requirements Roper needed to fulfill to obtain a 404 permit because: (1)\r\nthe 401 certifications that DHEC issued for projects authorized under NWP 29 or\r\nNWP 39 could not apply to the excavation of the pond because that activity was\r\nnot disclosed when Roper applied to the Corps for a 404 permit; (2) the project did\r\nnot comply with certain general conditions applicable to all NWPs, specifically\r\nthat DHEC consider the impacts to all land within a project boundary and to\r\nadjacent bodies of water or wetlands; (3) DHEC never issued a formal certification\r\nthat the project met the conditions under NWP 29 for water quality certification;\r\nand (4) DHEC failed to conduct the required review for compliance with certain\r\nwater quality regulations. We hold none of these allegations warrant reversal of\r\nthe ALC's finding that Roper had an effective 401 certification for its proposed\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nFirst, although Roper did not initially inform the Corps that it intended to dredge\r\nand excavate the pond as part of the project, as of January 6, 2009, when Whatley\r\nrequested a corrected letter from the Corps indicating that the impacts of the\r\nproject would be covered under NWP 29 instead of NWP 39, the Corps had been\r\ninformed that such an activity was to be part of the project. Having received this\r\ninformation, the Corps nevertheless determined that the project would result in\r\n\"minimal individual and cumulative environmental effects\" and met the conditions\r\nof NWP 29.\r\n\r\nAs to Appellants' second argument, we agree with their position that the general\r\nconditions for water quality certification require DHEC to review the \"overall\r\nproject proposed by a single owner/developer,\" \"includes all land within the project\r\n\nbound under single ownership,\" and is not confined to \"the land area directly\r\nimpacted by each NWP request\" and their assertion that no one at DHEC\r\nundertook a complete examination of the impact of the project on all waters and\r\nwetlands at the project site or determined if feasible alternatives were available.\r\nHere, however, 401 certification was necessary only as a prerequisite to obtaining\r\na 404 permit from the Corps for filling the jurisdictional wetlands. This\r\nrequirement was pursuant to 33 U.S.C. section 1341(a)(1) (2006), which states in\r\npertinent part:\r\n\r\n             Any applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct\r\n             any activity including, but not limited to, the construction\r\n             or operation of facilities, which may result in any\r\n             discharge into the navigable waters, shall provide the\r\n             licensing or permitting agency a certification from the\r\n             State in which the discharge originates or will originate,\r\n             . . . that any such discharge will comply with the\r\n             applicable provisions . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Appellants have emphasized they never argued that a 404\r\npermit was necessary to dredge and excavate the pond, and there was no\r\ncontention here that this activity would result in a discharge into a navigable water.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, according to their brief, the specific \"impacts\" that Appellants\r\nmaintain were overlooked by DHEC pertained only to the pond. As Appellants\r\npoint out, under DHEC's general conditions, Roper was required to: (1)\r\ndemonstrate that impacts to wetlands have been avoided and that unavoidable\r\nimpacts to wetland areas have been minimized; and (2) provide suitable\r\ncompensation for any unavoidable impacts. Roper, as the owner of the property on\r\nwhich the pond is located, would be the proper party to object to impacts that have\r\nnot been avoided or minimized and to enforce compensation for any unavoidable\r\nimpacts. In other words, Roper would be placed in the illogical position of having\r\nto complain about its own project or to demand compensation from itself.\r\n\r\nBased on our interpretation of the events in this case, we disagree with Appellants'\r\nthird argument, their assertion that the project never received a proper water\r\nquality certification for coverage under NWP 29. We acknowledge Hightower\r\nadmitted that after DHEC received notice from the Corps that the project would be\r\ncovered under NWP 29, it did not issue a letter advising Roper that the project\r\nwould be consistent with the 401 certification it issued for this NWP and agreed\r\nthat sending such a letter would have been advisable; however, he also testified\r\nthat an authorization letter was only a formality for the applicant's benefit and was\r\n\nnot required by the State General Permit. The Corps verified that Roper's proposed\r\nwork was eligible for coverage under NWP 29, and DHEC, consistent with its\r\nregulatory authority, had already issued a 401 certification for projects covered\r\nunder NWP 29. A follow-up letter would have served only as documentation of\r\nthis certification, and the absence of such a letter does not mean DHEC failed to\r\nissue a water quality certification for the project.\r\n\r\nFinally, Appellants have challenged the water quality certification on the ground\r\nthat DHEC failed to review the project to determine: (1) whether it complied with\r\n6 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-68 (2012) and 8 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101 (2012),\r\nboth of which were promulgated pursuant to the South Carolina Pollution Control\r\nAct; and (2) the impact of the draining and excavation of Roper Pond. They\r\nfurther argue the ALC erroneously relied on Responsible Economic Development\r\nv. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, 371 S.C. 547,\r\n552-53, 641 S.E.2d 425, 428 (2007), for the proposition that \"a stormwater permit\r\nissued pursuant to the Stormwater Act cannot be denied based on the regulations of\r\nthe Pollution Control Act.\" We need not determine whether the ALC correctly\r\napplied this holding. We have already determined that the Corps was aware that\r\nRoper intended to excavate the pond when it authorized coverage under NWP 29\r\nand that the 401 certification that DHEC issued for this NWP 29 satisfied the water\r\nquality certification requirement for a 404 permit.\r\n\r\nIII. Coverage Under the State General Permit\r\n\r\nFinally, Appellants take issue with the finding that Roper was entitled to coverage\r\nunder the State General Permit. They submit two arguments in support of their\r\nposition. We reject both arguments.\r\n\r\nFirst, Appellants reiterate their previous argument that Roper was not entitled to\r\ncoverage because the 401 certification was inadequate for a 404 permit, which in\r\nturn was a prerequisite for coverage under the State General Permit. We have\r\nalready determined that the 401 certification that DHEC issued was sufficient for\r\nRoper to obtain coverage under NWP 29.\r\n\r\nAppellants further contend that the excavation of the pond and lowering of its\r\nsurface would make the pond a water control structure and would therefore require,\r\nunder the terms of the State General Permit, a 404 permit from the Corps, which in\r\nturn would require a 401 certification. The ALC did not specifically address the\r\nquestion of whether the use of the pond as a water control structure required a 404\r\npermit, and Appellants did not request a ruling in their motion to reconsider. The\r\nissue, then, has not been preserved for appellate review, and it would be improper\r\n\nfor us to address it now. See Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d\r\n438, 444-45 (2000) (holding an issue was not preserved for appeal because the trial\r\njudge's general ruling was insufficient to preserve the specific issue for appellate\r\nreview and the appellant did not move to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to\r\nRule 59(e), SCRCP); Hendrix v. Eastern Distribution, Inc., 320 S.C. 218, 218, 464\r\nS.E.2d 112, 113 (1995) (vacating an opinion by this court \"to the extent it\r\naddressed an issue which was not preserved\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe agree with the ALC that none of the Appellants had standing to maintain their\r\nchallenge to the authorization of coverage for Roper Pond Apartments under the\r\nState General Permit. As to the merits of Appellants' arguments, we affirm the\r\nALC's ruling that Roper is entitled to this coverage.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5141","title":"Graham v.

Graham, Jr. (\"Graham\") appeals the circuit court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment to Welch, Roberts and Amburn, LLP, and Russell\r\nPatrick Welch (collectively, \"WRA\") based on its finding that Graham's claims\r\nwere barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Graham contends the circuit\r\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment when conflicting evidence existed as to\r\nwhen Graham knew or should have known he had a cause of action against WRA.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nRussell Patrick Welch (\"Welch\") is a partner at the Charleston accounting firm of\r\nWelch, Roberts and Amburn, LLP. In 2005, Graham hired WRA to perform\r\ncertain accounting and tax services.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 2005, Graham received a notice of tax liability stating that he owed\r\n$4,296.49 in unpaid taxes to the State of New York. On October 13, 2005,\r\nGraham issued a check to WRA for $4,296.49 believing the funds would be used\r\nto satisfy his outstanding tax liability. Graham included instructions on the face of\r\nthe check to \"Post to Account: DM Graham.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 28, 2005, WRA issued an invoice to Graham \"For Services\r\nRendered Through October 31, 2005\" in the amount of $6,656.00. This invoice\r\nincluded four line item descriptions of the services performed by WRA; none of\r\nthese descriptions indicate a payment was made for the tax liability to the State of\r\nNew York. Instead, this invoice reflected a credit towards the service charges for\r\n$4,296.49, leaving a balance owed in the amount of $2,359.51. On December 30,\r\n2005, Graham issued a check made payable to WRA for $2,359.51. This check\r\nGraham included the same instruction on the face of the check to \"Post to Account:\r\nDM Graham.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 28, 2008, Graham received notice from his bank that the New York\r\nState Department of Taxation and Finance had levied his account to collect unpaid\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2011, Graham commenced this action, alleging the following causes\r\nof action against WRA: professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,\r\nnegligent misrepresentation, conversion, and unjust enrichment. With his\r\ncomplaint, Graham attached an affidavit from Michael Goldson, Graham's new\r\naccountant, detailing the alleged actions of WRA, which he believed amounted to\r\nprofessional negligence. On May 24, 2011, WRA answered this complaint,\r\ndenying any allegations of misconduct and asserting several defenses, including\r\nthe statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 2011, WRA moved for summary judgment on the ground that Graham\r\nknew, or should have known, of his claims as early as November 2005 and the\r\naction was therefore barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\r\n\nOn October 26, 2011, Graham filed an affidavit detailing his version of the events\r\nthat led to this lawsuit. In this affidavit, Graham states that he \"agreed to send\r\n$4,296.49 to [WRA] and for [WRA] to pay the Tax Penalty on [his] behalf.\"\r\nGraham explained, \"At the time[,] it was not uncommon for [WRA] to pay\r\nexpenses on [his] behalf with funds [Graham] provided . . . .\" Graham also stated\r\nthat \"[o]n or about April 20, 2010,\" his bank confirmed that WRA deposited the\r\nfunds he believed were used to pay his taxes into WRA's account, and \"[t]his was\r\nthe first time [he] knew that a cause of action related to the failure to pay the tax\r\nliability might exist against [WRA].\"\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 2011, the circuit court heard WRA's motion for summary\r\njudgment. In addition to the pleadings, the court considered Graham's affidavit,\r\nGoldson's affidavit that accompanied the complaint, and an affidavit submitted by\r\nWelch at the hearing that detailed his account of the story.\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 2012, the circuit court issued an order granting WRA's motion for\r\nsummary judgment. In this order, the circuit court found that because Graham had\r\nreceived the November 28 invoice reflecting that Graham's payment of $4,296.49\r\nhad been applied towards services rendered and not towards his tax liability,\r\nGraham knew or should have known his causes of action against WRA existed at\r\nthat time. Accordingly, the circuit court concluded that \"more than three years had\r\npassed since [Graham] first knew or should have known\" about his claims, and, as\r\na result, his claims were now \"barred by the expiration of the statute of\r\nlimitations.\" This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same\r\nstandard applied by the [circuit] court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Bovain v. Canal\r\nIns., 383 S.C. 100, 105, 678 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2009). Rule 56(c) provides a circuit\r\ncourt may grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. (quoting Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP). \"In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and\r\nall inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in\r\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt.\r\nCo., 381 S.C. 326, 329-30, 673 S.E.2d 801, 802 (2009).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nGraham contends his October 26 affidavit creates conflicting evidence regarding\r\nwhen he knew or should have known of the existence of his cause of action;\r\ntherefore, he argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe applicable statute of limitations for Graham's causes of action is three years.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-530(5) (Supp. 2012) (stating the statute of limitations\r\nfor \"an action for assault, battery, or any injury to the person or rights of another,\r\nnot arising on contract and not enumerated by law\" is three years). The \"discovery\r\nrule\" applies to actions brought under section 15-5-530(5). See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n15-3-535 (Supp. 2012); Santee Portland Cement Co. v. Daniel Int'l Corp., 299 S.C.\r\n269, 272, 384 S.E.2d 693, 695 (1989), overruled on other grounds by Atlas Food\r\nSys. & Servs., Inc. v. Crane Nat. Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C.\r\n556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995) (\"Section 15-3-535 extended the 'discovery rule' to\r\nactions governed by § 15-3-530(5).\").\r\n\r\nAccording to \"the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the\r\ndate the injured party either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable\r\ndiligence, that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.\" True v.\r\nMonteith, 327 S.C. 116, 119, 489 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1997). \"We have interpreted\r\nthe 'exercise of reasonable diligence' to mean that the injured party must act with\r\nsome promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable\r\nperson of common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim against\r\nanother party might exist.\" Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363-64, 468\r\nS.E.2d 645, 647 (1996). In Bayle v. South Carolina Department of Transportation,\r\nthis court stated:\r\n\r\n             The date on which discovery of the cause of action\r\n             should have been made is an objective, rather than\r\n             subjective, question. In other words, whether the\r\n             particular plaintiff actually knew he had a claim is not the\r\n             test. Rather, courts must decide whether the\r\n             circumstances of the case would put a person of common\r\n             knowledge and experience on notice that some right of\r\n             his has been invaded, or that some claim against another\r\n             party might exist.\r\n\n344 S.C. 115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal citations\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\nHowever, when conflicting evidence exists on the issue of when a claimant knew\r\nor should have known that a cause of action existed, the issue becomes one for a\r\njury to decide. See Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320,\r\n338, 534 S.E.2d 672, 681 (2000) (\"[T]he determination of the date the statute [of\r\nlimitations] began to run in a particular case [is a question] of fact for the jury\r\nwhen the parties present conflicting evidence.\"); Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C.\r\n371, 377, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"The jury must resolve conflicting\r\nevidence as to whether a claimant knew or should have known he had a cause of\r\naction.\").\r\n\r\nThe resolution of this case hinges on when the three-year statute of limitations\r\nbegan to run. Graham contends the first time he knew or could have known about\r\nthe existence of claims against WRA was in 2008 when the state of New York\r\nlevied his account. Graham further argues his October 28 affidavit demonstrates a\r\ncourse of dealing between the parties that creates conflicting testimony regarding\r\nwhether he knew or should have known that his tax liability with New York was\r\nunpaid. According to Graham, \"this course of dealing would lead a reasonable\r\nperson to believe that the tax liability had been paid by [WRA], and it would not be\r\nuntil April 29, 2008, that a person of reasonable knowledge would conclude that\r\nthe tax liability had not been satisfied . . . .\"\r\n\r\nHowever, we find that the invoice provided to Graham on November 28, 2005,\r\nwould put \"a reasonable person of common knowledge and experience\" on notice\r\nthat the funds had not been applied towards the outstanding tax liability and had\r\ninstead been applied towards WRA's service charge. The invoice clearly indicates\r\nin its heading that it is billing \"[f]or [s]ervices [r]endered [t]hrough October 31,\r\n2005.\" Additionally, the bill shows a beginning balance of \"-$4,296.49,\" which is\r\nthe exact amount of the check issued by Graham to pay his New York tax liability.\r\nThe descriptions of the services provided do not mention the New York tax\r\nliability. The only mention of New York in the brief descriptions shows that WRA\r\nconducted \"[r]esearch [on] penalty notices from South Carolina and New York\r\nregarding prior year balances due.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree that Graham's affidavit creates a course of dealing that would lead a\r\nreasonable person to expect that Graham's check in the amount of his tax liability\r\n\nwould be used to satisfy that liability. Viewing this evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Graham, we find a reasonable person in his position would be justified\r\nin believing the funds were used in this way immediately following his delivery of\r\na check for $4,296.49. However, upon receipt of the invoice showing that exact\r\namount being applied towards \"services rendered,\" a reasonable person would then\r\nbe on notice that their previous assumption was no longer valid. Viewing all\r\ninferences that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Graham, we find that the invoice provides notice to \"a reasonable\r\nperson of common knowledge and experience\" that the money provided by\r\nGraham was not used to satisfy his tax liability with the state of New York.\r\nTherefore, the statute of limitations would have begun to run, at the latest, on\r\nDecember 30, 2005, the date when Graham paid the remaining balance from the\r\ninvoice.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the applicable statute of limitations on all of Graham's causes\r\nof action had run, and the circuit court properly granted WRA's motion for\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5142","title":"Hembree v.

Albin1, appeals the circuit court's order (1) ordering the forfeiture of his\r\nmotor home pursuant to section 44-53-520(a)(3) and (4) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2002), (2) finding that his failure to appeal the denial of his summary\r\njudgment motion rendered it the \"law of the case,\" and (3) dismissing his\r\ncounterclaim for conversion. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAfter receiving complaints of illegal gambling activities at Putters Lounge\r\n(Putters), a Horry County restaurant owned by Albin, agents for the South Carolina\r\nState Law Enforcement Division (SLED) initiated an investigation. Pursuant to\r\nthe investigation, Agents Christina Gainey and Kathy Bass visited Putters several\r\ntimes. During each of their visits, Agents Gainey and Bass engaged in illegal\r\ngambling while wearing a hidden recording device. In addition, during their final\r\nvisit, Agent Gainey asked Albin if she could purchase some marijuana from him.\r\nAlbin indicated that she and Agent Bass could smoke marijuana with him in his\r\nmotor home, which was parked directly behind Putters.\r\n\r\nThe following day, SLED agents executed a search warrant of Putters and the\r\nmotor home. Upon SLED's request, officers from the Horry County Police\r\nDepartment (HCPD) assisted with the search. During the search and a subsequent\r\ninventory of the contents of the motor home, officers from the HCPD discovered\r\nfive bags containing a total of 137 grams or approximately four ounces of\r\nmarijuana in the motor home, a pistol, and $1,847 in currency. In addition, SLED\r\nagents recovered approximately $15,000 in currency and a laptop computer from\r\nthe motor home and Putters.2 HCPD agents also seized the motor home during the\r\nexecution of the warrant.\r\n\r\nThe HCPD brought the instant action against Albin for forfeiture of the marijuana,\r\npistol, motor home, and $1,847 in currency the HCPD seized during the execution\r\nof the search warrant. Prior to trial, Albin moved for summary judgment on the\r\nground that forfeiture pursuant to section 44-53-520(a)(6) of the South Carolina\r\n\r\n1 This action was originally brought against Michael Albin. Mr. Albin died after\r\ntrial, and his estate is represented on appeal by Michaela Albin. For purposes of\r\nthis opinion and because it is not necessary to our analysis, we will not\r\ndifferentiate between Michael Albin and Michaela Albin.\r\n2 In general, SLED seized items associated with illegal gambling, while the HCPD\r\nseized items associated with illegal drug use.\r\n\nCode (Supp. 2012), which applies to conveyances, would not be proper because\r\nofficers seized less than a pound of marijuana required by the section for the\r\nforfeiture of a motor vehicle. In response, the HCPD agreed to strike the portion of\r\nits complaint proceeding pursuant to subsection (6) of section 44-53-520(a).\r\nHowever, the HCPD argued that it could properly proceed pursuant to subsections\r\n(3), which addresses containers, and (4), which addresses property used to\r\nfacilitate certain drug activities. In a pre-trial order, the Honorable Steven John\r\nagreed and denied Albin's motion for summary judgment, finding that the HCPD\r\ncould proceed pursuant to subsections (3) and (4).\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Larry B. Hyman tried the case in a bench trial on July 28, 2011.\r\nJust before trial, Albin again argued that the portion of the case seeking forfeiture\r\nof the motor home should be dismissed. Specifically, Albin argued that the\r\nofficers found less than a pound of marijuana in the motor home, which falls below\r\nthe threshold for allowing the forfeiture of a motor vehicle pursuant to subsection\r\n(6) of section 44-53-520(a). Judge Hyman denied the motion, finding Judge John's\r\nprior order denying Albin's motion for summary judgment on the same grounds\r\nwas the law of the case because Albin did not appeal that order.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the HCPD moved to dismiss Albin's counterclaims for the\r\nmisappropriation of $15,000 seized by SLED during the raid, arguing that they\r\nwere not properly before the court because SLED was not a party to the instant\r\naction. The circuit court agreed, dismissing the counterclaims without prejudice\r\nand noting that Albin was free to bring a separate action against SLED to recover\r\ncurrency seized by SLED.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Albin admitted giving marijuana to Agents Gainey and Bass in his motor\r\nhome but denied ever selling marijuana to anyone. Albin also admitted purchasing\r\nand smoking marijuana in his motor home and claimed he smoked marijuana\r\nbecause his doctor recommended he do so to alleviate the effects of radiation\r\ntreatments for cancer. Following the bench trial, the circuit court issued a final\r\norder (1) ordering the HCPD to return the pistol and $1,847 in currency to Albin\r\nand (2) finding Albin presented evidence reflecting legitimate sources of income\r\nand evidence that he purchased the pistol for protection after several burglaries and\r\nlarcenies of his business. However, the court ordered forfeiture of the motor home.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA. Forfeiture of the Motor Home\r\n\r\nAlbin argues the circuit court erred in ordering forfeiture of the motor home\r\npursuant to subsections (3) and (4) of section 44-53-520(a). Specifically, Albin\r\ncontends the court erred in allowing forfeiture of the motor home pursuant to these\r\nsubsections despite the fact that the amount of marijuana found in the motor home\r\nwas less than that required for the forfeiture of a motor vehicle pursuant to\r\nsubsection (6) of section 44-53-520(a). Albin also argues the circuit court erred in\r\nfinding Judge John's order denying his motion for summary judgment to be the law\r\nof the case. We agree.\r\n\r\nInitially, we find the circuit court erred in finding Judge John's order denying his\r\nmotion for summary judgment to be the law of the case. Albin could not have\r\nappealed this order because the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not\r\nappealable, even after final judgment. Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc.,\r\n354 S.C. 161, 167, 580 S.E.2d 440, 443-44 (2003). We also agree with Albin on\r\nthe merits.\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the legislature.\" Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459\r\n(2007). \"When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is\r\nno room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to\r\nits literal meaning.\" Id. In interpreting a statute, \"[w]ords must be given their\r\nplain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit\r\nor expand the statute's operation.\" Id. at 499, 640 S.E.2d at 459. Further, \"the\r\nstatute must be read as a whole and sections which are part of the same general\r\nstatutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.\" S.C. State\r\nPorts Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006).\r\nAccordingly, we \"read the statute as a whole\" and \"should not concentrate on\r\nisolated phrases within the statute.\" CFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty. Assessor, 395\r\nS.C. 67, 74, 716 S.E.2d 877, 881 (2011). \"In that vein, we must read the statute so\r\nthat no word, clause, sentence, provision or part shall be rendered surplusage, or\r\nsuperfluous, for the General Assembly obviously intended the statute to have some\r\nefficacy, or the legislature would not have enacted it into law.\" Id. (alterations,\r\ncitation, and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nSection 42-53-520(a) provides in pertinent part that the following are subject to\r\nforfeiture:\r\n\n             (1) all controlled substances which have been\r\n             manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or acquired in\r\n             violation of this article;\r\n\r\n             (2) all raw materials, products, and equipment of any\r\n             kind which are used, or which have been positioned for\r\n             use, in manufacturing, producing, compounding,\r\n             processing, delivering, importing, or exporting any\r\n             controlled substance in violation of this article;\r\n\r\n             (3) all property which is used, or which has been\r\n             positioned for use, as a container for property described\r\n             in items (1) or (2);\r\n\r\n             (4) All property, both real and personal, which in any\r\n             manner is knowingly used to facilitate production,\r\n             manufacturing, distribution, sale, importation,\r\n             exportation, or trafficking in various controlled\r\n             substances as defined in this article;\r\n\r\n             ...\r\n\r\n             (6) all conveyances including, but not limited to, trailers,\r\n             aircraft, motor vehicles, and watergoing vessels which\r\n             are used or intended for use unlawfully to conceal,\r\n             contain, or transport or facilitate the unlawful\r\n             concealment, possession, containment, manufacture, or\r\n             transportation of controlled substances and their\r\n             compounds, except as otherwise provided, must be\r\n             forfeited to the State. No motor vehicle may be forfeited\r\n             to the State under this item unless it is used, intended for\r\n             use, or in any manner facilitates a violation of Section\r\n             44-53-370(a)3, involving at least one pound or more of\r\n             marijuana . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Section 44-53-370(a) (Supp. 2012) of the South Carolina Code makes it illegal\r\n\"to manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, purchase, aid, abet, attempt, or\r\nconspire to manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, or purchase, or possess with\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-53-520(a) (Supp. 2012) (emphasis and footnote added).\r\nBased on the principles of statutory interpretation, we find the circuit court erred in\r\nordering forfeiture of the motor home pursuant to subsections (3) and (4). A\r\nstatute must be read as a whole and so that no phrase is rendered superfluous. See\r\nCFRE, LLC, 395 S.C. at 74, 716 S.E.2d at 881. Allowing a seizing agency to\r\nproceed pursuant to subsections (3) and (4) would render the one-pound weight\r\nlimitation found in subsection (6) regarding marijuana meaningless and, therefore,\r\nsuperfluous, because motor vehicles could in every situation be forfeited pursuant\r\nto another subsection. For example, as in the instant case, it is likely that in many,\r\nif not all, circumstances, a motor vehicle will serve as a container for controlled\r\nsubstances, in which case the motor vehicle could be forfeited pursuant to\r\nsubsection (3) as well as (6). This concern is further heightened by the fact that\r\nsubsection (6) purports to apply to \"all conveyances including . . . motor vehicles .\r\n. . which are used or intended for use unlawfully to . . . contain . . . controlled\r\nsubstances and their compounds . . . .\" This language indicates the legislature did\r\nnot intend for the State to pursue the forfeiture of a motor vehicle pursuant to\r\nsubsection (3), which applies to containers generally, as well as subsection (6),\r\nwhich specifically applies to motor vehicles. Otherwise, the above language in\r\nsubsection (6) is rendered redundant and unnecessary because the use of a motor\r\nvehicle as a container would already fall within subsection (3).\r\n\r\nFurther, it is difficult to ascertain why the legislature would preclude the forfeiture\r\nof a motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (6) but allow the forfeiture of the same\r\nmotor vehicle pursuant to subsections (3) or (4). The fact that the legislature\r\nspecifically addresses conveyances, including motor vehicles, in subsection (6)\r\nwould appear to reflect the intent that all conveyances be forfeited pursuant to that\r\nsubsection only. See Bloate v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1345, 1354 (2010)\r\n(\"[G]eneral language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it,\r\nwill not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the\r\nsame enactment[.]\" (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Skinner\r\nv. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 394 S.C. 428, 432-33, 716 S.E.2d 443, 445 (2011)\r\n(holding that a specific statute governing a certain issue controls over the more\r\ngeneral language of another statute addressing the issue); Avant v. Willowglen\r\nAcademy, 367 S.C. 315, 319, 626 S.E.2d 797, 799 (2006) (noting \"the principle\r\nthat more specific rules prevail over general ones\"). Based on the above\r\nconsiderations and because it is undisputed that less than a pound of marijuana was\r\n\r\nthe intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, or purchase a controlled\r\nsubstance or controlled substance analogue.\"\r\n\nfound in the motor home, we find the circuit court erred in ordering forfeiture of\r\nthe motor home pursuant to subsections (3) and (4). Accordingly, we reverse the\r\ncircuit court's order of forfeiture of the motor home.\r\n\r\nB. Dismissal of Counterclaims\r\n\r\nAlbin argues the circuit court erred in dismissing his counterclaims against SLED.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nAlbin filed counterclaims for the misappropriation of $15,000 allegedly seized by\r\nSLED during the raid. However, as noted by the circuit court, SLED was not a\r\nparty to the instant action, and, accordingly, the circuit court dismissed Albin's\r\ncounterclaims involving the seizure of the funds.\r\n\r\nDespite this, Albin points to two statutes in support of his argument that the circuit\r\ncourt improperly dismissed his counterclaims. First, Albin cites section 44-53-\r\n520(h) of the South Carolina Code (2002), which states that \"whenever the seizure\r\nof any property subject to seizure is accomplished as a result of a joint effort by\r\nmore than one law enforcement agency, the law enforcement agency initiating the\r\ninvestigation is considered to be the agency making the seizure.\" We fail to see\r\nhow this section supports Albin's argument that the circuit court erred in\r\ndismissing his counterclaims against SLED, which was not a party to the instant\r\naction. Further, SLED and the HCPD were investigating and searching for\r\nevidence of completely different criminal activity, i.e., the HCPD was\r\ninvestigating and searching for evidence of drug activity, and SLED was\r\ninvestigating and searching for evidence of illegal gambling activity. Accordingly,\r\nthis argument is without merit.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Albin contends that pursuant to section 44-53-530 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2012), a forfeiture action involving the funds seized by\r\nSLED would be brought by the same plaintiff, i.e., the circuit solicitor, as in the\r\ninstant case. Accordingly, Albin states this supports a finding that he could\r\nproperly bring counterclaims against SLED in the instant action. This argument is\r\nwithout merit because the circuit solicitor in the instant action was representing the\r\nHCPD, not SLED. The fact that the circuit solicitor would also be responsible for\r\nbringing a forfeiture action on behalf of SLED does not lead to the result that Albin\r\ncould properly file counterclaims in the instant case involving any property seized\r\nin the circuit, regardless of the agency that seized the property. Accordingly, the\r\ncircuit court did not err in dismissing Albin's counterclaims involving $15,000\r\n\nseized by SLED, and we affirm the circuit court's dismissal of Albin's\r\ncounterclaims.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the circuit court's order allowing forfeiture of\r\nthe motor home and affirm the ruling dismissing Albin's counterclaims against\r\nSLED.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5143","title":"Carlson v.

We\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 8, 2002, Roger F. Carlson and Mary Jo Carlson entered into a purchase\r\nagreement with Del Webb whereby they agreed to purchase a home in the Sun City\r\ndevelopment in Hilton Head, South Carolina. The purchase agreement contained\r\nthe following arbitration clause:\r\n\r\n               Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this\r\n               Agreement or Your purchase of the Property shall be\r\n               finally settled by arbitration administered by the\r\n               American Arbitration Association in accordance with its\r\n               Arbitration Rules for the Real Estate Industry and\r\n               judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be\r\n               entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\r\n\r\n               ...\r\n\r\n               After Closing, every controversy or claim arising out of\r\n               or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof shall\r\n               be settled by binding arbitration as provided by the South\r\n               Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act.\r\n\r\nThe deed to the home, which a representative for Del Webb executed on March 15,\r\n2002, did not include an arbitration clause.\r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Carlsons commenced the instant action against Del Webb\r\nand Pulte, alleging construction defects in their home's stucco siding. The\r\nCarlsons' case is one of about 140 cases currently pending against Del Webb and\r\nPulte involving stucco-clad homes in the Sun City development. Del Webb and\r\nPulte answered in December 2008 and asserted various defenses, including: (1) the\r\nalleged failure of the Carlsons to comply with sections 40-59-810 to -860 of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Del Webb is a subsidiary of Pulte.\r\n\nSouth Carolina Code (2011) (Right to Cure Act2 or the Act), and (2) that the\r\nCarlsons' claim was subject to mandatory arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn February 2009, the Carlsons sent Del Webb and Pulte a letter purportedly\r\nproviding notice as required by the Right to Cure Act along with a proposed\r\nconsent order staying the action to allow for compliance with the Act. Del Webb\r\nand Pulte responded with a letter requesting clarification of the defects as allowed\r\nby the Act. Del Webb and Pulte allege the Carlsons did not respond to the request.\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the circuit court entered a consent order finding that the Carlsons\r\nfiled the instant action without first complying with the requirements of the Right\r\nto Cure Act and staying the case until the Carlsons complied with the Act. The\r\nstay expired ninety days after it was entered. Del Webb and Pulte allege that, at a\r\nstatus conference in April 2010 addressing all 140 cases, they advised the circuit\r\ncourt that the two threshold issues to decide in the cases were the Right to Cure\r\nAct and arbitration. Also in April 2010, the Carlsons moved to amend their\r\ncomplaint to add class action allegations pursuant to Rule 23(a), SCRCP. Del\r\nWebb and Pulte opposed the motion, and the circuit court granted the motion on\r\nDecember 10, 2010. The Carlsons filed their amended complaint on December 29,\r\n2010.\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 2010, Del Webb and Pulte filed a motion to dismiss based on\r\nnoncompliance with the Right to Cure Act in a related case, Amadeo v. South\r\nCarolina State Plastering, LLC, Peter Conley, Individually, Del Webb, & Pulte,\r\nNo. 09-CP-2904 (hereinafter, Amadeo case). The case was one of the 140 cases\r\nbrought against Del Webb and Pulte alleging defective stucco on homes in the Sun\r\nCity development. In the alternative, Del Webb and Pulte moved to stay the case\r\nand compel compliance with the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The Right to Cure Act requires claimants to give notice to a contractor ninety\r\ndays before filing an action against the contractor arising out of the construction of\r\na dwelling. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-59-840 (2011). After receiving such notice, the\r\ncontractor has fifteen days to request clarification of the alleged defects if the\r\ndefect is not sufficiently stated. Id. Otherwise, the contractor has thirty days after\r\nreceipt of such notice to \"inspect, offer to remedy, offer to settle with the claimant,\r\nor deny the claim regarding the defects.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 40-59-850 (2011). If a\r\nclaimant files an action in court before complying with the Right to Cure Act, upon\r\nmotion of a party, the court shall stay the action until the claimant has complied\r\nwith the Act. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-59-830 (2011).\r\n\nIn a status conference on July 13, 2010, the circuit court imposed a seventy-day\r\nbriefing schedule to brief the Right to Cure Act issue. Del Webb and Pulte assert\r\nthey again informed the court during this status conference that the two threshold\r\nissues to address were the Right to Cure Act and arbitration, and the circuit court\r\nindicated its intent to address the Right to Cure Act issue first.\r\n\r\nIn an order filed January 11, 2011, the circuit court denied Del Webb and Pulte's\r\nmotion to dismiss in the Amadeo case. The circuit court noted that because it had\r\nnot yet certified the class, the order technically only applied to the Amadeo case,\r\nbut that \"all parties are aware that there are multiple pending similarly situated civil\r\nclaims.\"\r\n\r\nDel Webb and Pulte moved to compel arbitration in the current action on February\r\n14, 2011. In an order filed October 20, 2011, the circuit court denied the motion,\r\nfinding that Del Webb and Pulte had waived the right to compel arbitration based\r\non their delay in bringing the motion. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Standard of Review\r\n\"In reviewing a circuit court's decision regarding a motion to stay an action\r\npending arbitration, the determination of whether a party waived its right to\r\narbitrate is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review . . . .\" MailSource, LLC v.\r\nM.A. Bailey & Assocs., 356 S.C. 370, 374, 588 S.E.2d 639, 641 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nII. Waiver\r\nDel Webb and Pulte argue the circuit court erred in finding they waived their right\r\nto enforce the arbitration clause in the purchase contract by engaging in litigation\r\nfor over two years before filing a motion to compel arbitration. Specifically, Del\r\nWebb and Pulte argue (1) the Carlsons did not suffer any prejudice as the result of\r\nthe delay; (2) Del Webb and Pulte did not engage in any discovery before filing the\r\nmotion; and (3) Del Webb and Pulte did not file the motion sooner because they\r\nwere waiting on the resolution of the Right to Cure Act issue. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The right to enforce an arbitration clause may be waived.\" Davis v. KB Home of\r\nS.C., Inc., 394 S.C. 116, 131, 713 S.E.2d 799, 807 (Ct. App. 2011). \"In order to\r\nestablish waiver, a party must show prejudice through an undue burden caused by\r\ndelay in demanding arbitration.\" Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658,\r\n\n665, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999). \"There is no set rule as to what\r\nconstitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the question depends on the facts of\r\neach case.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nThis court has previously recognized three factors to consider when determining\r\nwhether a party has waived its right to compel arbitration:\r\n\r\n             (1) whether a substantial length of time transpired\r\n             between the commencement of the action and the\r\n             commencement of the motion to compel arbitration; (2)\r\n             whether the party requesting arbitration engaged in\r\n             extensive discovery before moving to compel arbitration;\r\n             and (3) whether the non-moving party was prejudiced by\r\n             the delay in seeking arbitration.\r\n\r\nDavis, 394 S.C. at 131, 713 S.E.2d at 807 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"To\r\nestablish prejudice, the non-moving party must show something more than mere\r\ninconvenience.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition to the above\r\nfactors, this court has also considered the extent to which the parties have availed\r\nthemselves of the circuit court's assistance. See id. at 133, 713 S.E.2d at 808.\r\n\r\nBased on the above factors, we find the circuit court erred in denying Del Webb\r\nand Pulte's motion to compel arbitration. First, we acknowledge that a relatively\r\nsubstantial length of time transpired in the instant case between the commencement\r\nof the action and the commencement of the motion to compel arbitration.\r\nSpecifically, the Carlsons commenced the instant action in September 2008, and\r\nDel Webb and Pulte did not file their motion to compel until February 2011, over\r\ntwo years after the filing of the complaint. Nevertheless, Del Webb and Pulte had\r\nraised the issue of arbitration since the inception of the action. The history of\r\nactivity in the instant case indicates that the delay in filing the motion to compel\r\nwas the result of the circuit court's decision to address the Right to Cure Act issue\r\nfirst and not because of any dilatory actions or tactics by Del Webb and Pulte.\r\n\r\nSecond, no discovery has occurred in the instant case. In its order, the circuit court\r\nrelied in part on a list of more than forty actions undertaken by Del Webb and\r\nPulte in support of its ruling denying the motion to compel arbitration. However,\r\nthe majority of the actions on the list were taken in other cases against Del Webb\r\nand Pulte. Although we recognize that similar cases are currently pending against\r\nDel Webb and Pulte, we find it would be inappropriate to consider actions\r\nundertaken in other cases for purposes of determining the extent of discovery that\r\n\nhas been undertaken in the instant case. Accordingly, we find the lack of\r\ndiscovery conducted by Del Webb and Pulte weighs in favor of granting the\r\nmotion to compel arbitration. See Gen. Equip. & Supply Co. v. Keller Rigging &\r\nConstr., SC, Inc., 344 S.C. 553, 557, 544 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding\r\nan eight-month period in which the \"litigation consisted of routine administrative\r\nmatters and limited discovery [that] did not involve the taking of depositions or\r\nextensive interrogatories\" did not establish waiver).\r\n\r\nFinally, due to the relatively limited amount of activity occurring in the instant\r\ncase, the Carlsons will not be prejudiced by Del Webb and Pulte's delay in filing\r\ntheir motion to compel arbitration. Further, the record reveals the Carlsons were\r\non notice from the inception of Del Webb and Pulte's involvement in the case that\r\nthey would be seeking to compel arbitration. Aside from the mere passage of time,\r\nthe Carlsons can point to no prejudice they will suffer as the result of Del Webb\r\nand Pulte's delay in moving to compel arbitration. Accordingly, we find this factor\r\nweighs in favor of granting the motion to compel arbitration. Based on the\r\nforegoing, we find the circuit court erred in denying Del Webb and Pulte's motion\r\nto compel arbitration.\r\n\r\nIII. Unconscionability\r\nThe Carlsons argue as an additional sustaining ground that the purchase agreement,\r\nincluding the arbitration clause, is unconscionable and, thus, unenforceable.3 We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\"General contract principles of state law apply in a court's evaluation of the\r\nenforceability of an arbitration clause.\" Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373\r\nS.C. 14, 24, 644 S.E.2d 663, 668 (2007). \"In South Carolina, unconscionability is\r\ndefined as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-\r\nsided contract provisions, together with terms that are so oppressive that no\r\nreasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept\r\nthem.\" Id. at 24-25, 644 S.E.2d at 668. In making this determination, courts must\r\nconsider that \"[t]he policies of the United States and this State favor arbitration of\r\ndisputes.\" New Hope Missionary Baptist Church v. Paragon Builders, 379 S.C.\r\n620, 630, 667 S.E.2d 1, 6 (Ct. App. 2008). Accordingly, \"[t]here is a strong\r\n\r\n\r\n3The Carlsons raised this argument and the following two arguments to the circuit\r\ncourt, but the court declined to rule on the issues because it denied the motion to\r\ncompel arbitration based on waiver.\r\n\npresumption in favor of the validity of arbitration agreements.\" Simpson, 373 S.C.\r\nat 24, 644 S.E.2d at 668.\r\n\r\nThe Carlsons point to the Simpson case cited above in support of their argument\r\nthat the arbitration clause in the purchase agreement was unconscionable.\r\nHowever, we find the facts of the instant case distinguishable. In Simpson, the\r\nsupreme court found an arbitration clause in a contract involving the sale of an\r\nautomobile to be unconscionable. Id. The court first determined that the purchaser\r\nhad no meaningful choice in agreeing to arbitrate because (1) the contract she\r\nsigned was an adhesion contract; (2) the arbitration clause was inconspicuous in\r\nthe contract; and (3) the purchase was for a necessity. Id. at 26-28, 644 S.E.2d at\r\n669-670. The court then determined that the arbitration clause was substantively\r\noppressive and one-sided because it prohibited the recovery of punitive,\r\nexemplary, double, or treble damages. Id. at 28, 644 S.E.2d at 670. The court\r\nfound this limitation on damages violated statutory law because it precluded the\r\nplaintiff from receiving mandatory statutory remedies under the South Carolina\r\nUnfair Trade Practices Act and the Dealers Act and undermined the statutes'\r\npurposes of punishing acts that adversely affect the public interest. Id. at 30, 644\r\nS.E.2d at 671. In addition, the court found the arbitration clause's stipulation that\r\nthe dealer could bring a judicial proceeding irrespective of any pending consumer\r\nclaims requiring arbitration to be oppressive. Id. at 31-32, 644 S.E.2d at 672.\r\nSpecifically, the court noted that this created the possibility of a scenario \"in which\r\na dealer's claim and delivery action is initiated in court, completed, and the vehicle\r\nsold prior to an arbitrator's determination of the consumer's rights in the same\r\nvehicle.\" Id. at 32, 644 S.E.2d at 672.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the facts in Simpson, no evidence in the record indicates whether the\r\npurchase agreement was an adhesion contract, and the clause is clearly identified in\r\nthe purchase agreement. In addition, the arbitration clause in the purchase\r\nagreement does not waive any rights or remedies otherwise available by law.\r\nAlthough the Carlsons point to other limitations in the purchase agreement, such as\r\na provision limiting the statute of limitations for bringing claims to two years,\r\nthese provisions are not part of the arbitration clause and are irrelevant to a\r\ndetermination of whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable. See Davis, 394\r\nS.C. at 125, 713 S.E.2d at 804 (noting that arbitration clauses are severable from\r\nthe contracts in which they are contained and, therefore, that the issue of the\r\narbitration clause's validity is distinct from the substantive validity of the contract\r\nas a whole). Finally, the arbitration clause does not lack mutuality and applies to\r\nDel Webb and Pulte as well as the Carlsons. Based on the foregoing, we find the\r\nCarlsons' argument that the arbitration clause was unconscionable is without merit.\r\n\nIV. Merger\r\nThe Carlsons also argue as an additional sustaining ground that the doctrine of\r\nmerger precludes arbitration of their claims. Specifically, the Carlsons argue that\r\nbecause the deed, which contained no arbitration clause, superseded the purchase\r\nagreement, their claims are not subject to arbitration. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe merger by deed doctrine provides that \"a deed made in in full execution of a\r\ncontract of sale of land merges the provisions of the contract therein.\" Charleston\r\n& W. Carolina Ry. Co. v. Joyce, 231 S.C. 493, 504, 99 S.E.2d 187, 193 (1957); see\r\nalso Wilson v. Landstrom, 281 S.C. 260, 264, 315 S.E.2d 130, 133 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n(\"A deed executed subsequent to the making of an executory contract for the sale\r\nof land supersedes that contract . . . .\" (quoting Charleston & W. Carolina Ry. Co.,\r\n231 S.C. at 505, 99 S.E.2d at 193)). However, agreements that are not intended to\r\nbe merged in a deed are not merged into the deed. See Hughes v. Greenville\r\nCountry Club, 283 S.C. 448, 450-51, 322 S.E.2d 827, 828 (Ct. App. 1984). \"[T]he\r\nparty denying merger has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence\r\nthat merger was not intended.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, we find the parties did not intend for the arbitration clause to be\r\nsuperseded by the subsequently-executed deed. The purchase agreement in the\r\ninstant case expressly provides, \"The covenants, disclaimers and agreements\r\ncontained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be merged into or waived by\r\nthe instruments executed at Closing, but shall expressly survive the Closing and\r\ncontinue to be binding upon both parties.\" In addition, the arbitration clause in the\r\npurchase agreement specifically states that \"[a]fter closing, every controversy or\r\nclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement . . . shall be settled by binding\r\narbitration.\" Pursuant to the clear and unambiguous terms of the purchase\r\nagreement, clear and convincing evidence supports a finding that the parties did\r\nnot intend for the arbitration clause to be merged into the deed at closing.\r\nAccordingly, this argument has no merit, and we decline to affirm the circuit\r\ncourt's order on this ground.\r\n\r\nV. Scope of Arbitration Clause\r\nAs a third additional sustaining ground, the Carlsons argue that because their\r\nclaims arise in tort, they are not subject to the purchase agreement's arbitration\r\nclause because the clause only applies to claims arising in contract. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Arbitration is a matter of contract[,] and a party cannot be required to submit to\r\narbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.\" New Hope Missionary\r\n\nBaptist Church, 379 S.C. at 627, 667 S.E.2d at 4. \"A clause which provides for\r\narbitration of all disputes 'arising out of or relating to' the contract is construed\r\nbroadly.\" Landers v. FDIC, 402 S.C. 100, __, 739 S.E.2d 209, 213-14 (citing\r\nPrima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 (1967)). Courts\r\nhave held that such broad clauses \"appl[y] to disputes in which a significant\r\nrelationship exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the\r\narbitration clause is contained.\" Id. at __, 739 S.E.2d at 214. \"Thus, the scope of\r\nthe clause does not limit arbitration to the literal interpretation or performance of\r\nthe contract, but embraces every dispute between the parties having a significant\r\nrelationship to the contract.\" Id. (alterations and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). Accordingly, the \"court must determine whether the factual allegations\r\nunderlying the claim are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause, regardless\r\nof the label assigned to the claim.\" Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580,\r\n597, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).\r\n\r\nBased on the above standard, we find the Carlsons' tort claims fall within the scope\r\nof the arbitration clause in the instant case. The arbitration clause in the purchase\r\nagreement executed by the Carlsons applies to \"every controversy or claim arising\r\nout of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof . . . .\" We hold the\r\nfactual allegations underlying the Carlsons' claims have a significant relationship\r\nbetween the purchase agreement, such that the arbitration clause should be read to\r\nencompass the Carlsons' tort claims. The Carlsons' claims all arise from Del Webb\r\nand Pulte's allegedly defective construction of their home. The purchase\r\nagreement encompassed the parties' agreements regarding the construction of the\r\nCarlsons' home and includes Del Webb and Pulte's agreement to construct a home\r\nfree from defective materials. Therefore, we find the arbitration clause in the\r\npurchase agreement was not intended to apply to claims arising in contract only\r\nand encompasses the Carlsons' tort claims as well. This conclusion is supported by\r\nrecent case law in this state. See, e.g., Landers, 402 S.C. at __, 739 S.E.2d at 214-\r\n15 (finding plaintiff's tort claims for slander and intentional infliction of emotional\r\nstress arising from his employment with the defendant were encompassed by an\r\narbitration clause in his employment contract that requires arbitration for \"any\r\ncontroversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach\r\nthereof\"). Accordingly, we find this argument is without merit and decline to\r\naffirm the circuit court's decision on this ground.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the order of the circuit court denying Del Webb\r\nand Pulte's motion to compel arbitration.\r\n\nREVERSED.     \n\r\n\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5144","title":"Hamilton v.

We\r\naffirm.               FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nEmma Hamilton worked as a machine operator for Martin Color-Fi, Inc. in Sumter,\r\nSouth Carolina. On July 22, 2008, she was injured at work when her right hand and\r\nforearm were caught in rollers and \"crushed.\" She went to Tuomey Hospital\r\nEmergency Room and was treated for pain. The next day she began treatment with\r\nan orthopedist, Dr. James Gee. She continued to experience intermittent pain and\r\nweakness but Dr. Gee noted steady improvement. He ordered a nerve conduction\r\nstudy on October 22, 2008 because of her continued complaints. On November\r\n26, 2008, Hamilton had an MRI of her wrist. Dr. Gee explained to Hamilton both\r\ntests came back essentially normal and she would improve over time.\r\n\r\nDr. Gee referred Hamilton to Dr. Michael Green, a hand specialist. Dr. Green\r\nbelieved she was at MMI and assigned her a 2% permanent disability rating, which\r\nhe later changed to a 1% rating. At Dr. Green's suggestion, the insurance carrier\r\nauthorized work hardening. This was discontinued because Hamilton continued to\r\nreport pain in her hand and wrist. Dr. Gee advised her time would be the best cure\r\nand she needed to work on strengthening her hand herself.\r\n\r\nDr. Blake Moore conducted an independent medical evaluation (IME) of Hamilton\r\non June 1, 2009. He stated she had not yet achieved MMI and would benefit from\r\nfurther treatment potentially, including surgery. He gave her a 7% whole person\r\nimpairment rating.\r\n\r\nDr. Gee referred her to a hand specialist, Dr. David Fulton, for another IME on\r\nJune 30, 2010. He placed Hamilton at MMI stating he saw no need to continue\r\nmedical treatment and no permanent impairment.\r\n\r\nHamilton worked light duty at Martin Color-Fi until she was laid off in December\r\n2008. She testified she does light chores around the house and has not looked for\r\nanother job since she was laid off.\r\n\r\nOn October 12, 2010, Martin Color-Fi and its carrier, Liberty Mutual Insurance\r\nCompany (collectively, Respondents), filed a Form 21 with the Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission requesting a stop payment of temporary compensation\r\nbecause Hamilton had reached MMI. They further requested to pay the permanent\r\ndisability amount and to receive a credit for overpayment of temporary\r\ncompensation. Hamilton filed a Form 50 on November 22, 2010, asking for\r\n\nadditional treatment. Respondents filed a Form 51, denying the need for additional\r\nmedical treatment.\r\n\r\nA hearing was held on December 15, 2010, in front of a single commissioner. He\r\nset forth an order declaring Hamilton had reached MMI, she was entitled to 10%\r\npermanent partial disability, and Respondents were entitled to a stop payment of\r\ntemporary total compensation as of June 30, 2010. He calculated her total\r\ncompensation at $7,575.70. He found Respondents were entitled to a credit for\r\noverpayment against the award for permanent partial disability from that date in\r\nthe amount of $11,019.20. Hamilton appealed to the Appellate Panel, which\r\naffirmed in full. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard\r\nfor judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276\r\nS.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the scope of review\r\nestablished in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\nAppellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\nreverse when the decision is affected by an error of law. Stone v. Traylor Bros.,\r\nInc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a workers'\r\ncompensation decision. Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593\r\nS.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\n            \"Substantial evidence\" is not a mere scintilla of evidence\r\n            . . . [but] is evidence which, considering the record as a\r\n            whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n            conclusion that the administrative agency reached . . . .\r\n\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\n\r\n                               LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Stop Payment\r\nHamilton argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she reached MMI on June 30,\r\n2010, because her authorized health care provider did not report she reached MMI.\r\nShe asserts only Drs. Green and Fulton, her IME doctors, stated she was at MMI.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\nThe relevant South Carolina Regulation states:\r\n\r\n            After the one hundred fifty day period, when the claimant\r\n            is receiving temporary compensation and the authorized\r\n            health care provider reports the claimant has reached\r\n            maximum medical improvement, the employer's\r\n            representative shall continue payment of temporary\r\n            compensation until the Commission finds the employer's\r\n            representative may terminate compensation unless\r\n            compensation has been suspended according to R.67-\r\n            505.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-506(B) (2012).\r\n\r\nThe record contains substantial evidence Hamilton's authorized health care\r\nprovider found she had reached MMI. The Appellate Panel found Dr. Gee placed\r\nHamilton at MMI in a report dated May 27, 2009. Dr. Gee is Hamilton's\r\nauthorized health care of provider. His report specifically states \"at some point\r\nbetween February 25, 2009 and March 25, 2009, [he] felt she reached maximum\r\nmedical benefits as far as active orthopedic care was concerned.\" Additionally, Dr.\r\nGreen placed Hamilton at MMI on February 11, 2009. Dr. Fulton found she\r\nreached MMI when he saw her on June 30, 2010. The Appellate Panel determined\r\nHamilton reached MMI on June 30, 2010.\r\n\r\nNowhere does Reg. 67-506(B) require the date the authorized health care provider\r\ngives for the patient's MMI match the date given by the Appellate Panel. Nor does\r\nit state the Appellate Panel is barred from considering MMI dates offered by other\r\nphysicians. Id. Here, Hamilton's authorized health care provider determined she\r\nreached MMI before the date the Appellate Panel chose. Other doctors placed her\r\nat MMI around the same time as her authorized provider or on the same date the\r\nAppellate Panel found. Accordingly, we affirm the Appellate Panel's decision.\r\n\r\nII.   MMI\r\nHamilton contends the Appellate Panel erred in finding she had reached MMI\r\nbecause Drs. Green, Fulton, and Gee either did not find she was at MMI or their\r\nfindings were unsupported by evidence. Hamilton maintains Dr. Green's\r\nrecommendation of work hardening contradicts a finding of MMI. She asserts\r\nbecause Dr. Fulton did not use the term \"maximum medical improvement,\" his\r\nreport is not adequate. Likewise, Hamilton questions Dr. Gee's finding of MMI\r\nbecause he also suggested work hardening. We disagree.\r\n\nMMI \"is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the\r\nphysician's opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen\r\nthe degree of impairment.\" O'Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24,\r\n28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995). MMI is a factual determination made by\r\nthe Appellate Panel that will be upheld unless not supported by substantial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\"[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does\r\nnot prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial\r\nevidence.\" Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432,\r\n319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). When the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue,\r\nthe findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive. Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co.,\r\n360 S.C. 276, 290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004). In workers'\r\ncompensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact. Shealy v.\r\nAiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000). The final\r\ndetermination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is\r\nreserved to the Appellate Panel. Bass v. Kenco Grp., 366 S.C. 450, 458, 622\r\nS.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel found Drs. Green, Fulton, and Gee all determined at some\r\npoint Hamilton was at MMI. The record contains substantial evidence to support\r\nthese findings. Dr. Green believed work hardening could increase her strength in\r\nthe injured hand and she had reached maximum medical benefits with regard to\r\nmotion. He stated she could work unrestricted activities. Dr. Fulton determined\r\nshe could work without restriction and no further treatment was medically\r\nnecessary. As previously discussed, Dr. Gee reported that Hamilton reached MMI\r\nsometime between February and March 2008.\r\n\r\nHamilton also questions the decision of the Appellate Panel to give more weight to\r\nthe findings of Drs. Green and Fulton than Dr. Moore and the Appellate Panel's\r\nfinding she was at MMI when Dr. Moore stated she had not reached MMI yet. She\r\nclaims his report is the most thorough and should, therefore, be given more\r\ndeference.\r\n\r\nThe regulations do not forbid the assignment of more or less weight to different\r\nreports. Hamilton does not deny that Drs. Green and Fulton are \"hand specialists\";\r\nshe only asks the Appellate Panel be stopped from giving their opinions more\r\nweight. Nothing suggests the Appellate Panel overreached in giving more\r\ncredence to the reports of more specialized physicians.\r\n\nSouth Carolina jurisprudence makes clear the Appellate Panel determines the\r\nweight of the evidence. The Appellate Panel had all four doctors' reports available\r\nto them and decided the reports of Drs. Green, Fulton, and Gee were more\r\nconvincing than Dr. Moore's. Nothing in the record suggests this determination\r\nwas beyond their scope or flawed. The Appellate Panel makes the final\r\ndetermination on credibility. Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err in\r\nfinding Hamilton had reached MMI.\r\n\r\nIII.   Necessary Medical Treatment\r\nHamilton argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she was not entitled to further\r\nmedical treatment. She claims that while she saw four doctors to manage her\r\ninjury, she was only treated by Dr. Gee, and she categorizes his care as minimal.\r\nAlthough he ordered a nerve conduction study and MRI of the wrist, Hamilton\r\nbelieves he ignored the findings of the tests. In his report, Dr. Moore wrote\r\nsurgery ought to be considered based on his reading of the MRI. Hamilton also\r\npoints to the note found in the nerve conduction study requesting the neurologist\r\n\"rule out other potential contributing factors.\" She posits this note restricted the\r\nneurologist to only eliminate other potential causes of her wrist problems rather\r\nthan look for the underlying cause. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-15-60 of the South Carolina Code outlines the employer's financial\r\nresponsibilities to an employee receiving workers' compensation. It states:\r\n\r\n            The employer shall provide medical, surgical, hospital,\r\n            and other treatment, including medical and surgical\r\n            supplies as reasonably may be required, for a period not\r\n            exceeding ten weeks from the date of an injury, to effect\r\n            a cure or give relief and for an additional time as in the\r\n            judgment of the commission will tend to lessen the\r\n            period of disability as evidenced by expert medical\r\n            evidence stated to a reasonable degree of medical\r\n            certainty. In addition to it, the original artificial members\r\n            as reasonably may be necessary must be provided by the\r\n            employer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-15-60(A) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe record contains substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panel's finding\r\nHamilton was not entitled to further medical treatment. Hamilton was seen and\r\ntreated by Dr. Gee for over two years. Many of the notes from those visits indicate\r\n\nDr. Gee believed time would be a major factor in her improvement. He did not\r\npursue a more aggressive course because he reasoned usage of the wrist over time\r\nwould produce a better result.\r\n\r\nFurther, substantial evidence indicates the MRI and nerve conduction studies were\r\nnot ignored. Dr. Moore focused on the fact the MRI revealed \"subtle sclerosis with\r\nincreased signal and small subchondral cystic degenerative changes.\" However,\r\nDr. Gee specifically states Hamilton's MRI was essentially normal. He and Dr.\r\nFulton also found the nerve conduction study results were normal. Drs. Green,\r\nFulton, and Gee all agreed she would not benefit from further medical treatment.\r\nDr. Gee, as the authorized treating physician, completed a Form 14B stating he\r\nbelieved within a reasonable degree of medical certainty Hamilton did not require\r\nmore treatment. Dr. Moore's report conflicted with the other recommendations;\r\nhowever, the Appellate Panel had access to all the reports and determined medical\r\ncare should be stopped. Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err in ordering\r\nmedical care be stopped.\r\n\r\nIV.   Hamilton's Credibility\r\nHamilton contends the Appellate Panel erred in finding her uncredible. She\r\nmaintains the Appellate Panel has no cause to question her credibility. She argues\r\nthe mere attempt to use a post hole digger was held against her. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded\r\nevidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel. Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448,\r\n455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000) (citing Ford v. Allied Chem. Co., 252 S.C. 561,\r\n167 S.E.2d 564 (1969)). It is not the task of an appellate court to weigh the\r\nevidence as found by the Appellate Panel. Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C.\r\n487, 494-95, 541 S.E.2d 526, 529 (2001).\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel was in the best position to gauge the credibility of a witness\r\nbecause they saw and talked with her. No other evidence in the record points to\r\nHamilton's credibility, however this court differentiates between the use and the\r\nattempted use of a post hole digger. Therefore, the Appellate Panel did not err in\r\nfinding her uncredible.\r\n\r\nV.    10% Permanent Partial Disability\r\nHamilton contends the Appellate Panel erred in determining her disability to be\r\n10% and requests a greater award of partial disability. She does not attempt to\r\nshow a loss of earning capacity. Hamilton does state that the doctor's impairment\r\n\nrating is unreliable. She points to Dr. Greene's initially stating she suffered a 2%\r\npermanent impairment to her right arm and later changing it to 1%. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe only injury Hamilton sustained was to her right arm. Therefore, she is eligible\r\nto receive permanent partial disability under section 42-9-30(13) which grants \"for\r\nthe loss of an arm, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wages\r\nduring two hundred twenty weeks.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-30(13) (Supp. 2012).\r\nTo come under the statute, a claimant must show an injury and a loss of earning\r\ncapacity. Bass v. Kenco Grp., 366 S.C. 450, 460-61, 622 S.E.2d 577, 582 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005).\r\n\r\n\"[T]he extent of an injured workman's disability is a question of fact for\r\ndetermination by the [Appellate Panel] and will not be reversed if it is supported\r\nby competent evidence.\" Colvin v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours Co., 227 S.C. 465,\r\n473, 88 S.E.2d 581, 585 (1955).\r\n\r\nIn this case, Dr. Green assigned Hamilton an impairment rating in her right arm of\r\n2%, which was later changed to 1%. Dr. Fulton stated he saw no permanent partial\r\nimpairment of her right arm. Dr. Fulton gave her a 7% whole person rating.\r\nHamilton does not point to any facts other than Dr. Fulton's recommendation in\r\nsupport of her contention her disability percentage should be higher. The opinions\r\nsubmitted by the two other doctors support the determination of the Appellate\r\nPanel. Therefore, sufficient evidence justified the Appellate Panel's finding of\r\n10% permanent disability.         CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5117","title":"Colonna v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nColonna sustained an admittedly compensable injury to her right ankle and foot on\r\nFebruary 21, 2004, when she slipped on a wet floor and twisted her right ankle and\r\nfoot while working as a geriatric nurse for Marlboro Park. Marlboro Park accepted\r\nher claim and began providing medical treatment and compensation. However,\r\nColonna continued to experience pain and ceased working as a result of her injury.\r\nColonna claimed she required surgery; in response, Marlboro Park sought a\r\ndetermination of whether Colonna had reached MMI and was entitled to additional\r\nmedical treatment.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner held a hearing and subsequently issued an order on\r\nAugust 22, 2005 (2005 Order), finding Colonna sustained \"a right lower extremity\r\n(ankle) injury,\" was entitled to additional medical treatment and temporary total\r\ndisability benefits, and had not reached MMI. In addition, the single commissioner\r\nfound Colonna \"had some aggravation of pre-existing psychological problems\r\nbecause of this injury, but she . . . failed to prove her need for psychological\r\ntreatment [wa]s the sole result of this accidental injury.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of her continuing medical issues, Colonna underwent surgery shortly after\r\nthe initial hearing in May 2005. In March 2006, her attending surgeon, Dr. Mark\r\nEasley, of Duke University Medical Center, opined her condition had stabilized,\r\nassigned an impairment rating of 40% to her right lower extremity, and released\r\nher from his care. Based on Dr. Easley's report, Marlboro Park sought an order\r\nterminating temporary compensation, awarding permanent disability, and\r\nrequesting a credit for overpayment of temporary compensation. In response,\r\nColonna contended she had not reached MMI and requested additional medical\r\ntreatment for her injuries.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the single commissioner issued an order on May 8, 2007 (2007\r\nOrder), and found Colonna reached MMI in March 2006, sustained a 50%\r\npermanent partial disability to her right lower extremity, and was entitled to all\r\ncausally-related medical treatment for her injuries. The single commissioner\r\nterminated her temporary compensation and found Marlboro Park was entitled to a\r\ncredit for overpayment of temporary compensation, which would be deducted from\r\nher permanent partial disability award of 97.5 weeks. In addition, the single\r\n\ncommissioner held the compensability of any psychological injury was not before\r\nhim based on the parties' prior stipulation in the 2005 Order that Colonna had not\r\nsustained a compensable psychological injury. The Commission upheld the single\r\ncommissioner's order in full, and Colonna did not appeal this order.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Colonna complained of continued problems with her right ankle and\r\nfoot and filed a change of condition claim, seeking additional medical treatment,\r\nincluding a second surgery. Marlboro Park authorized the additional treatment and\r\nreinstated her temporary total disability compensation. Colonna underwent a\r\nsecond surgery with Dr. Easley on her right ankle. From an orthopedic standpoint,\r\nDr. Easley concluded Colonna had reached MMI for her right ankle and foot in\r\nJuly 2008 and assessed a 35% impairment rating.\r\n\r\nColonna then sought medical treatment from Dr. Sonia Pasi, a pain management\r\nand neurology specialist, at Duke University Medical Center. Dr. Pasi diagnosed\r\nher with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD),1 which caused chronic pain to\r\nColonna's right foot and ankle, resulting from her compensable right foot and ankle\r\ninjury. In August 2008, Dr. Pasi implanted a trial spinal stimulator to help\r\nalleviate her RSD. Following a successful trial period, Dr. Pasi and Dr. Peter\r\nGrossi implanted a permanent spinal cord stimulator in Colonna's back in\r\nDecember 2008. Dr. Pasi opined she was at MMI for her right leg and foot in\r\nMarch 2009.\r\n\r\nColonna subsequently underwent a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) in April\r\n2009, which found she was able to work at a light physical demand level for an\r\neight-hour day and was \"most likely limited to simple, or unskilled, or at most,\r\ndetailed, or semi-skilled clerical administrative and similar work activities . . . .\" In\r\nconducting the FCE, the evaluator noted, \"The combination of symptom\r\nexaggeration and submaximal effort is thought to represent a voluntary effort to\r\ndemonstrate a greater level of disability than is actually present.\"\r\n\r\nMarlboro Park again filed a Form 21 to stop payment of temporary total disability\r\nbenefits and sought a determination for permanent impairment as well as a credit\r\nfor overpayment of temporary compensation. In response, Colonna alleged\r\nadditional injuries to her right knee, left knee, back, neck, and right shoulder and\r\n\r\n1 Our supreme court defined RSD as follows in Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 397\r\nn.1, 570 S.E.2d 176, 178 n.1 (2002): \"Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy ('RSD') is a\r\nrare condition affecting the sympathetic nervous system, usually in an extremity,\r\nresulting in ongoing cycles of extreme pain. It is often triggered by an accident,\r\nsurgery, or other injury.\"\r\n\nsought a finding of compensability and additional medical treatment. In support of\r\nher claim, Colonna testified she could not exercise, suffered from constant stiffness\r\nand chronic pain in her right ankle, was unable to drive, and was receiving Social\r\nSecurity disability benefits because of her injury.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner held a hearing and issued an order on March 1, 2010. In\r\nhis order, he held Colonna failed to prove she sustained compensable injuries to\r\nher right knee, left knee, back, neck, or right shoulder. He further found Colonna\r\nhad reached MMI for her right foot and ankle injury, and Marlboro Park was\r\nentitled to stop temporary disability benefits. He also concluded she had not\r\nsuffered any additional permanent partial disability but was entitled to ongoing\r\nmedical treatment as recommended by her authorized treating physician, Dr. Pasi.\r\n\r\nThe Commission upheld the single commissioner's decision, adopting the single\r\ncommissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law in full. Colonna appealed\r\nto this court, and we transferred her case to the circuit court pursuant to Rule 204,\r\nSCACR, because this case accrued prior to July 1, 2007. See Pee Dee Reg'l\r\nTransp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 375 S.C. 60, 62, 650 S.E.2d 464, 465 (2007)\r\n(holding that all workers' compensation cases in which the injury occurred on or\r\nafter July 1, 2007, should be made directly to the Court of Appeals).\r\n\r\nAfter two hearings, the circuit court upheld the Commission's decision in full. In\r\ndoing so, the circuit court held the following: (1) the surgery to implant the spinal\r\ncord stimulator to treat Colonna's RSD did not constitute a separate injury to her\r\nback that would bring her within the \"two-body part\" rule, but her spine was,\r\ninstead, \"merely the site for treatment modality\"; (2) the 2007 Order holding that\r\nshe had not sustained a compensable psychological condition was law of the case\r\nand, because Colonna had not raised this issue to the Commission, she was barred\r\nfrom arguing it on appeal; (3) Colonna was limited to recovery under section 42-9-\r\n30 because she only suffered a compensable injury to a single scheduled member;\r\n(4) Colonna had not suffered any additional permanent partial disability to her\r\nright ankle/foot; (5) Colonna reached MMI for her right ankle/foot injury; and (6)\r\nColonna was entitled to additional medical treatment as recommended by Dr. Pasi,\r\nincluding lifetime maintenance and treatment of her spinal cord stimulator. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) governs appeals from\r\ndecisions of an administrative agency. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380 (Supp. 2012);\r\nLark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the\r\n\nAPA, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to\r\nthe weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the\r\ndecision is affected by an error of law. § 1-23-380(5). If the findings, inferences,\r\nconclusions, or decisions of that agency are \"clearly erroneous in view of the\r\nreliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record[,]\" a reviewing\r\ncourt may reverse or modify. Id. Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\nreasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached. Pratt\r\nv. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n1. Permanent and Total Disability Pursuant to Section 42-9-10.\r\nColonna contends her work-related injury affected more than one body part; thus,\r\nshe is entitled to a permanent, total disability award pursuant to section 42-9-10.\r\nSpecifically, Colonna claims she satisfied the \"two-body part\" rule in section 42-9-\r\n10 because: (1) the implantation of the spinal cord stimulator affected her back;\r\nand (2) her right foot/ankle injury aggravated her preexisting psychological\r\nproblems. We address each argument in turn.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina provides three methods to receive disability compensation: (1) total\r\ndisability under section 42-9-10; (2) partial disability under South Carolina Code\r\nsection 42-9-20 (Supp. 2012); and (3) scheduled disability under section 42-9-30.\r\nWigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 105, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 (2003).\r\nThe first two methods are based on the economic model in most instances, while\r\nthe third method conclusively relies upon the medical model with its presumption\r\nof lost earning capacity. Id.\r\n\r\nAs stated in Singleton v. Young Lumber Company, 236 S.C. 454, 471, 114 S.E.2d\r\n837, 845 (1960), \"Where the injury is confined to the scheduled member, and there\r\nis no impairment of any other part of the body because of such injury, the\r\nemployee is limited to the scheduled compensation [pursuant to section 42-9-30] . .\r\n. . To obtain compensation in addition to that scheduled for the injured member,\r\nclaimant must show that some other part of his body is affected.\" (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\r\nAs reflected by the foregoing language, Singleton stands for the exclusive rule that\r\na claimant with one scheduled injury is limited to recovery under section 42-9-30\r\nalone. The case also stands for the rule that an individual is not limited to\r\nscheduled benefits under section 42-9-30 if he or she can show additional injuries\r\n\nbeyond a lone scheduled injury. See Wigfall, 354 S.C. at 106, 580 S.E.2d at 103.\r\nThe principle espoused in Singleton recognizes \"the common-sense fact that, when\r\ntwo or more scheduled injuries [or a scheduled and non-scheduled injury] occur\r\ntogether, the disabling effect may be far greater than the arithmetical total of the\r\nschedule allowances added together.\" Id. at 106-07, 580 S.E.2d at 103 (internal\r\ncitation omitted). Accordingly, the question of whether Colonna is totally and\r\npermanently disabled, and thus entitled to recover under section 42-9-10, turns on\r\nwhether her initial injury had a \"disabling effect\" on other parts of her body.\r\n\r\na. Back Injury\r\nColonna first argues her claim is within the ambit of section 42-9-10 as a matter of\r\nlaw because the implantation of the spinal cord stimulator affected her back. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nColonna relies on the portion of Singleton, wherein the supreme court held, \"To\r\nobtain compensation in addition to that scheduled for the injured member, claimant\r\nmust show that some other part of his body is affected.\" Singleton, 236 S.C. at\r\n471, 114 S.E.2d at 845 (emphasis added). Because her right foot/ankle injury\r\nnecessitated the implantation of a spinal cord stimulator, Colonna claims her back\r\nwas affected, thus triggering the \"two-body part\" rule.2\r\n\r\nNo South Carolina case directly addresses whether the implantation of a spinal\r\ncord stimulator constitutes an indirect injury to the back. However, we find that a\r\nmore thorough reading of Singleton and subsequent cases demonstrates that a\r\nclaimant must prove not only that another body part was affected by the insertion\r\nof the treatment device, but that another body part was impaired or injured for\r\n\r\n2 In support of her argument that the implantation of a spinal cord stimulator is\r\nconclusive proof of an indirect injury to the back, Colonna cites to Haley v. ABB,\r\nInc., 621 S.E.2d 180 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003). In Haley, the North Carolina Court of\r\nAppeals stated that \"[Haley's] back condition resulted from the implantation of the\r\nspinal cord stimulator [to treat RSD] and was a natural and probable result of the\r\ncompensable injury by accident and resulting pain.\" Id. at 185. However, we find\r\nHaley distinguishable because in that case, the unsuccessful implantation caused\r\nHaley to experience severe back pain at the site of the insertion. Id. at 182. As a\r\nresult of the unsuccessful implantation, the court held her back condition was the\r\nnatural and probable result of the work-related injury. Unlike in Haley, Colonna\r\nhas failed to sufficiently demonstrate that her initial injury or the resulting surgery\r\ncaused Colonna back pain or impairment. Thus, we find Haley is distinguishable\r\nfrom the instant case.\r\n\nsection 42-9-10 to apply. See id. at 471, 114 S.E.2d at 845 (\"Where the injury is\r\nconfined to the scheduled member, and there is no impairment of any other part of\r\nthe body because of such injury, the employee is limited to the scheduled\r\ncompensation . . . .\" (emphasis added)); see also Wigfall, 354 S.C. at 106, 580\r\nS.E.2d at 103 (finding the Singleton court intended for \"impairment\" to encompass\r\na physical deficiency and concluding a claimant is not limited to scheduled\r\nbenefits under section 42-9-30 if he or she can show \"additional injuries beyond a\r\nlone scheduled injury\"); Bixby v. City of Charleston, 300 S.C. 390, 397, 388 S.E.2d\r\n258, 262 (Ct. App. 1989) (analyzing whether the claimant's injury to a scheduled\r\nmember \"affected\" another body part by analyzing whether the claimant\r\n\"suffer[ed] a residual disability as a result\" of the compensable injury (emphasis\r\nadded)).\r\n\r\nWe find Colonna's argument flawed because she failed to demonstrate that the\r\nimplantation of the spinal cord stimulator injured her back or caused additional\r\nback impairment. We concur with the circuit court's conclusion:\r\n\r\n             The only relationship between [Colonna's] foot and ankle\r\n             injury and her spine is that the spine was merely the site\r\n             for a treatment modality that would serve to improve the\r\n             functioning in her right leg. The spinal cord stimulator\r\n             was implanted for the sole purpose of deriving a benefit\r\n             to nerve deficits in her right leg. The spinal cord\r\n             stimulator was not implanted to diagnose, remedy or treat\r\n             any condition in her spine. . . .\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n             . . . Implantation of a spinal cord stimulator, without\r\n             evidence of causally-related symptoms, pain or ill effects\r\n             in the spine, does not render the body part \"affected\"\r\n             under the Act and therefore, there are no additional body\r\n             parts, including the back, which were affected by\r\n             [Colonna's] work injury or subsequent treatment for\r\n             same.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we find substantial evidence in the record to support the circuit\r\ncourt's decision that Colonna did not suffer additional injury or impairment to her\r\nback as a result of the spinal cord implantation. Dr. Pasi's medical notes reflect\r\nColonna complained of pain in her right foot, toes, ankle, knee, and leg. In\r\n\naddition, Dr. Pasi noted Colonna complained of pain in her left leg, back, neck, and\r\nshoulder, but only diagnosed Colonna with RSD of \"the lower limb\" and\r\nconcluded her implantation surgery was successful. Upon examination, Dr. Pasi\r\nconcluded Colonna's cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of her spine were all\r\nstable and her range of motion in those areas was also normal. We recognize\r\nColonna's testimony before the single commissioner conflicted with Dr. Pasi's\r\nconclusions. Specifically, she stated, \"I can't lift twenty pounds without straining\r\nand hurting my right foot and right ankle as well as my back. Since I have a spinal\r\ncord stimulator in my back[,] I can't lift twenty pounds.\" Colonna also testified she\r\ncould only drive short distances after the implantation of the spinal cord stimulator,\r\nand her husband typically drove her everywhere. However, when faced with\r\nconflicting testimony, we are constrained by our limited standard of review. See\r\nStokes v. First Nat'l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1991)\r\n(\"Regardless of conflict in the evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same\r\nwitness, a finding of fact by the Commission is conclusive.\"). Therefore, we defer\r\nto the Commission on this issue.\r\n\r\nb. Preexisting Psychological Injury\r\n\r\nNext, Colonna contends she is entitled to benefits pursuant to section 42-9-10\r\nbecause her injury aggravated her preexisting psychological problems. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nClaims for psychological injury are compensable only if the claimant proves by a\r\npreponderance of evidence they are caused by physical injury or by extraordinary\r\nand unusual conditions of employment. Pack v. State Dep't of Transp., 381 S.C.\r\n526, 538, 673 S.E.2d 461, 467 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\nIn the 2005 Order, the single commissioner held, \"[Colonna] has had some\r\naggravation of pre-existing psychological problems because of this injury, but she\r\nhas failed to prove her need for psychological treatment is the sole result of this\r\naccidental injury.\" In the 2007 Order, Colonna stipulated that \"[she] did not\r\nsustain [a] compensable psychological injury per prior Order of the Commission.\"\r\nAs a result, the single commissioner noted compensability of any psychological\r\ninjury was not before him in light of the 2005 Order that found Colonna did not\r\nsustain a compensable psychological injury. Colonna never appealed this ruling;\r\ntherefore, it is law of the case. See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &\r\nTouche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding an unappealed\r\nruling is law of the case and should not be reconsidered by the appellate court).\r\nAccordingly, we find the compensability of any preexisting psychological\r\n\nproblems, and thus whether those problems constitute a second injury under\r\nsection 42-9-10, are not properly before this court.3\r\n\r\nc. Requirement to Apply Section 42-9-10\r\n\r\nLast, Colonna contends the circuit court erred in failing to award her benefits under\r\nsection 42-9-10 because she is entitled to recover under whichever statute provides\r\nthe greatest benefits. We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, an injured employee may proceed under either the general disability\r\nstatutes, i.e., sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20, or under the scheduled member statute,\r\ni.e., section 42-9-30, to maximize recovery under the South Carolina Workers'\r\nCompensation Act. See Brown v. Owen Steel Co., 316 S.C. 278, 280, 450 S.E.2d\r\n57, 58 (Ct. App. 1994) (proceeding under the general disability sections for an\r\ninjury to a scheduled member gives the claimant \"the opportunity to establish a\r\ndisability greater than the presumptive disability provided for under the scheduled\r\nmember section\"). However, the scheduled recovery is exclusive only when a\r\nscheduled loss is not accompanied by additional complications affecting another\r\npart of the body. See id. (citing Singleton, 236 S.C. at 471, 114 S.E.2d at 845).\r\n\r\nAlthough Colonna may proceed under the general disability statutes to maximize\r\nher recovery, we find Colonna's argument that the Commission is \"required\" to\r\nmake an award for permanent and total disability under section 42-9-10 misplaced.\r\nAs the aforementioned case law demonstrates, Colonna's ability to recover under\r\nsection 42-9-10 is premised on her ability to establish an additional injury or\r\nimpairment to a second body part. See id., 316 S.C. at 280, 450 S.E.2d at 58\r\n(holding commission properly required employee to proceed under the scheduled\r\n\r\n\r\n3 We note Colonna attempts to distinguish what she is now arguing on appeal from\r\nthe prior rulings of the Commission and circuit court. She contends that while the\r\nparties stipulated her psychological injury was not compensable, i.e., she was not\r\nentitled to receive medical treatment, the single commissioner's statement in the\r\n2005 Order that \"she had some aggravation of pre-existing psychological problems\r\nbecause of this injury\" conclusively proves that her injury produced a\r\npsychological injury or overlay, which would entitle her to recover under section\r\n42-9-10. However, if Colonna's preexisting mental injury is not compensable as a\r\nmatter of law, we find it cannot be an \"affected\" or injured member for purposes of\r\ntriggering benefits under section 42-9-10.\r\n\nmember section when employee failed to prove back injury affected other body\r\nparts or contributed to an impairment beyond a single scheduled member); cf.\r\nSimmons v. City of Charleston, 349 S.C. 64, 76, 562 S.E.2d 47, 482 (Ct. App.\r\n2002) (finding a firefighter was not limited to recovery under the scheduled\r\nmember statute when he presented substantial evidence that he suffered additional\r\ncomplications to another part of his body, thus entitling firefighter to recover under\r\nthe general disability statute). Because Colonna failed to sustain her burden of\r\nproof on this issue, we find the circuit court properly limited Colonna's recovery to\r\nsection 42-9-30.\r\n\r\n2. Permanent Partial Disability\r\n\r\nIn the alternative, Colonna claims she is entitled to additional permanent, partial\r\ndisability benefits for her left leg and back following her admitted change of\r\ncondition for the worse. We disagree.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note that Colonna captioned her entitlement to additional permanent\r\npartial disability benefits as it relates to \"her left leg and back.\" However, the\r\ncircuit court's order addresses her entitlement to additional permanent partial\r\ndisability benefits only in reference to her \"right lower extremity for the\r\ncompensable injury suffered to the right ankle/foot.\" Neither the single\r\ncommissioner, the Commission, nor the circuit court addressed Colonna's\r\nentitlement to additional permanent partial disability benefits as it related to her\r\nleft leg and back. Because an issue must be properly raised below before we may\r\naddress it on appeal, we find this issue is not properly preserved for appellate\r\nreview. See Pratt, 353 S.C. at 352, 577 S.E.2d at 481-82 (stating an issue cannot\r\nbe raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the single commissioner or in a request for commission review of the single\r\ncommissioner's order to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\nEven if we assume Colonna intended to reference her right ankle/foot injury, we\r\nfind substantial evidence exists to support the circuit court's decision to uphold the\r\nCommission on this issue. First, Colonna had already received permanent partial\r\ndisability for the injury she sustained to her right ankle and foot. The medical\r\nevidence shows that Colonna's impairment rating for her right ankle and foot\r\ndecreased from 40% to 35% between her first surgery in 2005 and her second\r\nsurgery in 2007, which indicates her disability could have decreased as well.\r\nFurther, despite Dr. Pasi's diagnosis of RSD and acknowledgement of Colonna's\r\ncomplaints of chronic pain, she did not assign Colonna with an impairment rating\r\nfor her RSD. Rather, once Colonna underwent the surgery to implant the spinal\r\ncord stimulator, Dr. Pasi concluded the implantation was \"successful,\" and as of\r\n\nMarch 18, 2009, she opined Colonna was at MMI for her right leg and foot pain.\r\nIn view of the foregoing, we hold Colonna failed to establish the requisite facts to\r\nentitle her to additional disability benefits. See Smith v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320\r\nS.C. 296, 298, 465 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"The claimant has the burden to\r\nprove such facts as will render the injury compensable.\").\r\n\r\n3. Maximum Medical Improvement\r\n\r\nNext, Colonna claims the circuit court erred in upholding the Commission's\r\ndecision that she had attained MMI. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"[MMI] is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in\r\nthe physician's opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will\r\nlessen the degree of impairment.\" O'Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C.\r\n24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995). \"MMI is a factual determination left\r\nto the discretion of the [Commission].\" Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214,\r\n224, 628 S.E.2d 262, 268 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nColonna conceded before the circuit court that she attained MMI for her right ankle\r\nand foot injury but claims on appeal that she has not been medically released for\r\nher alleged back injury stemming from the implantation of the spinal cord\r\nstimulator. Therefore, without a finding of MMI for her back, she asserts\r\ntermination of temporary total disability benefits was premature. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe find there is substantial evidence in the record to support the circuit court's\r\nconclusion that Colonna did not sustain a compensable back injury. Likewise, a\r\nfinding of MMI for the back is unnecessary before Colonna's temporary total\r\ndisability benefits could be properly terminated. The only required MMI\r\ndetermination was for Colonna's injury to her right ankle and foot, which we find\r\nwas proper based on Dr. Easley's and Dr. Pasi's conclusions that Colonna had\r\nattained MMI.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the only medical evidence documenting Colonna's care after her spinal\r\ncord surgery was that of Dr. Pasi. Dr. Pasi saw Colonna three times after her\r\nsurgery for follow-up visits and concluded the implantation was successful. Dr.\r\nPasi's records do not document any back pain after the surgery; to the contrary, Dr.\r\nPasi notes that Colonna's cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of her spine were\r\nall stable and her range of motion in those areas was also normal.\r\n\r\nDespite Colonna's argument to the contrary, we find the circuit court's mandate to\r\ncontinue medical treatment does not negate our conclusion as the Commission may\r\n\ncontinue to award additional medical treatment if it tends to lessen Colonna's\r\nperiod of disability despite the fact that she has reached MMI for her right ankle\r\nand foot injury. See Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 583,\r\n514 S.E.2d 593, 598 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding \"an employer may be liable for a\r\nclaimant's future medical treatment if it tends to lessen the claimant's period of\r\ndisability despite the fact the claimant has returned to work and has reached\r\n[MMI]\"); see also Cranford v. Hutchinson Constr., 399 S.C. 65, 78, 731 S.E.2d\r\n303, 310 (Ct. App. 2012) (holding a finding of MMI was proper when treating\r\nphysician's report coupled with prescription was evidence from which single\r\ncommissioner could conclude the medication would help alleviate claimant's\r\nremaining symptoms, but his medical condition would not further improve);\r\nScruggs v. Tuscarora Yarns, Inc., 294 S.C. 47, 50, 362 S.E.2d 319, 321 (Ct. App.\r\n1987) (holding substantial evidence supported a finding of MMI despite the\r\nclaimant continuing to receive physical therapy). Based on the foregoing, we\r\naffirm the circuit court's conclusion that Colonna attained MMI and was no longer\r\nentitled to temporary total benefits.\r\n\r\n4. Lifetime Maintenance of Spinal Cord Stimulator\r\nLast, Colonna contends the circuit court erred in failing to order Marlboro Park to\r\nprovide lifetime maintenance of the spinal cord stimulator. We decline to address\r\nthis issue.\r\n\r\nThe Commission's order provided that Colonna was \"entitled to ongoing medical\r\ntreatment for her right ankle/foot as recommended by her authorized, treating\r\nphysician, Dr. Pasi.\" On appeal to the circuit court, the court specifically\r\naddressed the issue of lifetime maintenance to the spinal cord stimulator when it\r\nconcluded, \"Pursuant to section 42-15-60, [Colonna] is entitled to ongoing medical\r\ntreatment for her right ankle/foot as recommended by her authorized, treating\r\nphysician, Dr. Pasi, to include lifetime maintenance of the spinal cord stimulator.\"\r\n(emphasis added). Marlboro Park concedes this issue in its brief, stating, \"There is\r\nno dispute over this issue. . . . This is not a contested issue and this Court need not\r\naddress it.\" Accordingly, we decline to address this issue. See Leatherwood v.\r\nLeatherwood, 293 S.C. 148, 150, 359 S.E.2d 89, 90 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding\r\nparties' concessions on issues negated necessity of addressing those issues on\r\nappeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and CURETON, AJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5145","title":"State v.

Catoe, both of Columbia,\r\n            for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Appellant, Richard Burton Beekman, was convicted of criminal sexual\r\nconduct (CSC) with a minor in the first degree and lewd act upon a child. On\r\nappeal, Beekman contends the trial court erred in: (1) refusing to sever the two\r\ncharges because they involved two victims, did not arise out of a single chain of\r\ncircumstances, and were not provable by the same evidence; (2) admitting alleged\r\nprior bad act evidence where there was only a general similarity between the prior\r\nbad act and the crime and the probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial\r\n\neffect; and (3) failing to grant a new trial where the cumulative effect of trial errors\r\nwas so prejudicial as to deprive him of a fair trial. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nBeekman was indicted for sexual crimes against his two stepchildren, Stepdaughter\r\nand Stepson. Specifically, Beekman was charged with commission of a lewd act on\r\nStepdaughter and CSC with a minor in the first degree in regard to Stepson.\r\nStepdaughter testified that one night, when she was twelve years old, she awoke to\r\nfind Beekman touching her private area with his hand on her bare skin. Stepson,\r\nwho was eight years old during the time, testified to several instances of\r\ninappropriate touching involving Beekman, and an instance where Beekman\r\nultimately sexually penetrated him, which was the basis of the CSC charge.\r\nFollowing submission of the case to the jury, Beekman was found guilty of CSC\r\nwith a minor in the first degree in regard to Stepson and commission of lewd act\r\nupon a child with regard to Stepdaughter. He was sentenced to thirty years for the\r\nCSC charge and was given a consecutive sentence of fifteen years for the lewd act\r\ncharge. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1. Whether the trial court erred in refusing to sever Beekman's charges where the\r\nalleged sexual abuse involved two victims, the offenses did not arise out of a single\r\nchain of circumstances and were not provable by the same evidence, and Beekman\r\nwas prejudiced by its improper influential effect on the jury.\r\n\r\n2. Whether the trial court erred in admitting alleged prior bad act evidence where\r\nthe connection between the prior bad act and the crime was nothing more than a\r\ngeneral similarity and the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its\r\nprejudicial effect.\r\n\r\n3. Whether the trial court erred in refusing to grant a new trial where the\r\ncumulative effect of the errors was so prejudicial as to deprive Beekman of a fair\r\ntrial.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Motion to Sever\r\n\r\nBeekman first argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever his\r\ncharges, asserting they involved two different victims, they did not arise out of a\r\nsingle chain of circumstances, they were not provable by the same evidence, and\r\nhe was prejudiced by the improper consolidation of the charges. He contends the\r\nState would not be able to show a common scheme or plan in a subsequent trial\r\nunder Rule 404(b), SCRE, because the connection between the prior bad act and\r\nthe crime requires more than just a general similarity. Additionally, he maintains,\r\neven if the evidence of prior bad acts would have been admissible under Rule\r\n404(b), SCRE, its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed any probative value\r\nunder Rule 403, SCRE, noting in particular the lack of physical evidence. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nA motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge,\r\nwhose ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\r\nState v. Caldwell, 378 S.C. 268, 277, 662 S.E.2d 474, 479 (Ct. App. 2008). In\r\ndetermining whether the trial court's consolidation of charges was proper, the\r\nappellate court considers several factors. State v. Rice, 368 S.C. 610, 614, 629\r\nS.E.2d 393, 394 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n             Where the offenses charged in separate indictments are\r\n             of the same general nature involving connected\r\n             transactions closely related in kind, place and character,\r\n             the trial judge has the power, in his discretion, to order\r\n             the indictments tried together if the defendant's\r\n             substantive rights would not be prejudiced. Offenses are\r\n             considered to be of the same general nature where they\r\n             are interconnected.\r\n\r\n             Conversely, offenses which are of the same nature, but\r\n             which do not arise out of a single chain of circumstances\r\n             and are not provable by the same evidence may not\r\n             properly be tried together.\r\n\r\n             Charges can be joined in the same indictment and tried\r\n             together where they (1) arise out of a single chain of\r\n             circumstances; (2) are proved by the same evidence; (3)\r\n\n             are of the same general nature; and (4) no real right of\r\n             the defendant has been prejudiced.\r\n\r\nId. at 614-15, 629 S.E.2d at 395 (citations and parentheticals omitted).\r\n\r\nPrejudice to a defendant may occur where the defendant is jointly tried on charges\r\nresulting in the admission of prior bad act evidence that would have otherwise been\r\ninadmissible. State v. Cutro, 365 S.C. 366, 374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2005).\r\nSouth Carolina Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides: \"Evidence of other crimes,\r\nwrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to\r\nshow action in conformity therewith.\" However, such evidence may be admissible\r\n\"to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence\r\nof mistake or accident, or intent.\" Rule 404(b), SCRE; see also State v. Lyle, 125\r\nS.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923) (finding such evidence admissible to show\r\nmotive, intent, the absence of mistake or accident, the existence of a common\r\nscheme or plan, or identity). Additionally, even if prior bad act evidence is found\r\nadmissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE, the evidence must nonetheless be excluded if\r\nits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\r\nunder Rule 403, SCRE.1 State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872, 876\r\n(2007).\r\n\r\nOur courts have considered a single chain of circumstances exists when there is\r\n\"'in substance a single . . . course of conduct' or 'connected transactions'\" involved.\r\nState v. Tate, 286 S.C. 462, 464, 334 S.E.2d 289, 290 (Ct. App. 1985); see City of\r\nGreenville v. Chapman, 210 S.C. 157, 161, 41 S.E.2d 865, 866-67 (1947)\r\n(affirming the trial court's determination that, while the various counts could not be\r\ndeemed as arising out of the same transaction in the narrow sense of that phrase,\r\nthey did arise out of a series of identical transactions, their respective dates\r\nconstituting the only difference between them, and noting the phrase \"the same\r\ntransaction\" should not be given such a restricted meaning where the warrant was\r\nfounded upon what was in substance a single criminal course of conduct).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the indictments involved two different victims did not require\r\nseverance of the charges. See Cutro, 365 S.C. at 369-75, 618 S.E.2d at 891-95\r\n(affirming the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to sever charges involving\r\nthree victims, where appellant was charged with two counts of homicide by child\r\n\r\n1\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\" Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\nabuse and one count of assault and battery involving incidents all occurring at\r\ndifferent times with different children); State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 315, 479\r\nS.E.2d 517, 519-20 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding consolidation was proper even\r\nthough the allegations concerned two different victims, noting the offenses charged\r\nwere of the same general nature involving allegations of a pattern of sexual abuse\r\ninvolving the two minor victims). Here, the evidence established Beekman\r\nembarked upon a series of actions aimed at the sexual abuse of his two\r\nprepubescent stepchildren over the course of an eight month period. Thus, we find\r\nthe two charges against Beekman arose from, in substance, a single course of\r\nconduct or connected transactions, and decline to give such a restrictive reading of\r\nthe phrase \"a single chain of circumstances\" as asserted by Beekman.\r\nAdditionally, as noted by the trial court, there was a great overlap of evidence\r\nbetween the two charges, and the two charges were provable by the same evidence.\r\n\r\nWe further find Beekman was not prejudiced by the joinder, because evidence\r\nregarding his sexual abuse of each of the stepchildren would have been admissible\r\nin separate trials to show a common scheme or plan. \"When determining whether\r\nevidence is admissible as common scheme or plan, the trial court must analyze the\r\nsimilarities and dissimilarities between the crime charged and the bad act evidence\r\nto determine whether there is a close degree of similarity.\" State v. Wallace, 384\r\nS.C. 428, 433, 683 S.E.2d 275, 277-78 (2009). \"When the similarities outweigh\r\nthe dissimilarities, the bad act evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b).\" Id. at\r\n433, 683 S.E.2d at 278. In determining whether a close degree of similarity exists,\r\nsome of the factors to consider are: (1) the age of the victims when the abuse\r\noccurred; (2) the relationship between the victims and the perpetrator; (3) the\r\nlocation where the abuse occurred; (4) the use of coercion or threats; and (5) the\r\nmanner of the occurrence, for example, the type of sexual battery. Id. at 433-34,\r\n683 S.E.2d at 278. The above list of factors is not an exhaustive list, but is merely\r\nset forth for guidance, and other factors may be relevant in determining whether\r\nthe similarities outweigh the dissimilarities. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, there are similarities between the acts in regard to Stepdaughter and Stepson,\r\nwhich include Beekman's relationship as stepfather to the victims and the\r\noccurrence of each incident of abuse in the family home. Though Stepson was\r\neight years old and Stepdaughter was twelve years old when the abuse occurred,\r\nneither child had reached puberty and Stepdaughter was described as being very\r\nlittle with an immature body at that time. We recognize that Stepson reported\r\nBeekman's use of threats and coercion while Stepdaughter did not, and the type of\r\nsexual battery for which Beekman was ultimately charged was different for the two\r\nvictims. However, the evidence suggests Beekman's abuse of Stepdaughter was\r\n\nhalted by Stepdaughter before he had the opportunity to use threats or coercion and\r\nbefore he could progress from the inappropriate touching involved in the lewd act\r\ncharge in regard to Stepdaughter to the incident of penetration involved in the CSC\r\ncharge in regard to Stepson. Notably, Stepson's abuse also started with\r\ninappropriate touching. Thus, these factors do not diminish the similarity between\r\nthe acts. See id. at 435, 683 S.E.2d at 278 (finding the fact that victim's abuse was\r\ninterrupted before it could culminate in intercourse did not diminish the similarity\r\nbetween the incidents). Further, additional similarities are present in this case.\r\nThe two children are biological siblings; the first instances of abuse involved\r\ninappropriate touching with Beekman placing his hand on the unclothed genitalia\r\nof the children; Beekman always had a news program on television while he\r\ncommitted the sexual abuse against the victims; and the incidents all occurred\r\nwithin an eight month period, with evidence suggesting the last abuse of Stepson\r\noccurred close to the time of the incident involving Stepdaughter and just prior to\r\nher disclosure. Accordingly, we find the sexual abuse of each child would have\r\nbeen admissible in separate trials under the common scheme or plan exception\r\nbased upon the close degree of similarity between the incidents of abuse.\r\n\r\nWe further find no error in the trial court's determination that the probative value\r\nof the prior bad act evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to\r\nBeekman under Rule 403, SCRE. See State v. Clasby, 385 S.C. 148, 158-59, 682\r\nS.E.2d 892, 897-98 (2009) (\"Finally, we hold the probative value of this evidence\r\nsubstantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to Clasby. Given there was\r\nno physical evidence to corroborate B.C.'s testimony regarding the indicted\r\noffenses of CSC with a minor, first degree and lewd act upon a child, we find her\r\ntestimony of Clasby's sustained illicit conduct was extremely probative to establish\r\nthe charged criminal sexual conduct underlying the offense of lewd act upon a\r\nchild.\").\r\n\r\nIn sum, we find the offenses charged in the separate indictments are of the same\r\ngeneral nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and\r\ncharacter; they arise out of a single chain of circumstances; they are provable by\r\nthe same evidence; and Beekman's substantive rights have not been prejudiced.\r\nSee Cutro, 365 S.C. at 375, 618 S.E.2d at 895 (holding joinder of indictments for\r\nhomicide by child abuse of two children and one indictment for assault and battery\r\nof a third child was proper where all three offenses were similar in kind, place, and\r\ncharacter and fit within the common scheme or plan and motive exceptions under\r\nLyle).\r\n\nII.   Prior Bad Act Evidence\r\n\r\nBeekman next contends the trial court erred in admitting alleged prior bad act\r\nevidence where the connection between the prior bad act and the crime was\r\nnothing more than a general similarity, and the probative value of the evidence was\r\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect. He argues his case is distinguishable from\r\nClasby, because the alleged sexual misconduct in Clasby was directed at the same\r\nvictim, the alleged incidents in his case did not establish a pattern of sexual abuse,\r\nand there was not a close degree of similarity between the crimes charged in his\r\ncase since one involved touching the outside of a female's vagina and the other\r\ninvolved male anal penetration. Beekman contends the facts of his case mirror the\r\nfacts of this court's opinion in State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d 186 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2003). He further argues the probative value of the prior bad act evidence did\r\nnot substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice to him where there was\r\nno physical evidence to support Stepdaughter's and Stepson's allegations, Stepson's\r\nrectal exam was normal and showed no signs of penetration, and Stepson did not\r\nclaim the sexual abuse until he learned of Stepdaughter's sexual abuse allegation.\r\n\r\nIn making this argument on appeal, Beekman cites only to arguments raised at trial\r\nconcerning the admissibility of bad act evidence in regard to Stepson, i.e., alleged\r\ninappropriate touching of Stepson evidence. He does not reference any arguments\r\nat trial concerning admissibility of Stepdaughter's allegations as prior bad act\r\nevidence. This is likely so because Beekman did not specifically object to\r\nevidence concerning Stepdaughter's allegations on the basis that it was\r\ninadmissible as prior bad act evidence. He only made a trial objection to Stepson's\r\nallegations of inappropriate touching on the basis that it constituted prior bad act\r\nevidence. Yet Beekman's arguments on appeal of this issue all reflect a challenge\r\nto admission of prior bad act evidence relating to the two siblings, which\r\nultimately came in as a result of joinder of the trials.\r\n\r\nBecause Beekman's only objection at trial on the basis that it was prior bad act\r\nevidence related to evidence of prior inappropriate touchings of Stepson, his\r\nargument on appeal that the substantive evidence surrounding the charges as to\r\nStepdaughter and Stepson were inadmissible in the joint trial as they did not fall\r\nwithin an exception allowing prior bad act evidence is not preserved for our\r\nreview.2 See State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 646, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003)\r\n\r\n2Anticipating the introduction of the forensic interview video of Stepson,\r\nBeekman objected to two portions of the video, one portion relating to\r\nStepdaughter and another regarding prior inappropriate touchings of Stepson. In\r\n\n(noting an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by trial court to be preserved for\r\nappellate review). Further, Beekman does not challenge on appeal the trial court's\r\ndetermination that the evidence concerning the alleged inappropriate touching of\r\nStepson by Beekman was admissible. Thus, the propriety of admitting the prior\r\nbad act evidence as to Stepson is the law of the case. See State v. Fripp, 396 S.C.\r\n434, 441, 721 S.E.2d 465, 468 (Ct. App. 2012) (noting an appellant's failure to\r\nchallenge the trial court's ruling in the appellate brief renders the unchallenged\r\nruling the law of the case).\r\n\r\nAt any rate, even assuming Beekman's argument is properly preserved for our\r\nreview, we have already determined the evidence of allegations concerning\r\nStepdaughter and Stepson was admissible under the common scheme or plan\r\nexception of Rule 404(b), SCRE, and Lyle based upon the similarities surrounding\r\nthe charges. Beekman's reliance on Tutton does not change that analysis. See\r\nWallace, 384 S.C. at 434 n.5, 683 S.E.2d at 278 n.5 (stating, in regard to the close\r\ndegree of similarity required, as follows: \"The Court of Appeals relied on State v.\r\nTutton, 354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. 2003), which appears to require a\r\nconnection beyond a degree of similarity in the details of the crime charged and the\r\nbad act evidence. We find this interpretation to be an overly restrictive view of our\r\ncase law. Requiring a 'connection' between the crime charged and the bad act\r\nevidence is simply a requirement that the two be factually similar and does not add\r\nan additional layer of analysis.\"); see also Clasby, 385 S.C. at 158 n.2, 682 S.E.2d\r\nat 897 n.2 (noting this court's holding in Tutton \"was called into question by the\r\nmajority opinion in Wallace on the ground the analysis constituted an overly\r\nrestrictive view of our case law\"). Further, assuming Beekman has properly\r\nchallenged on appeal the trial court's ruling concerning the admissibility of\r\nevidence of prior inappropriate touching of Stepson, we would nonetheless affirm\r\non the merits. Id. at 156, 682 S.E.2d at 896 (holding the trial court properly\r\nadmitted the proffered evidence of four incidents of uncharged sexual misconduct\r\ncommitted by Clasby on victim prior to the offenses for which Clasby was indicted\r\nand tried, where each of the incidents established a pattern of escalating abuse\r\n\r\nregard to Stepdaughter, Beekman argued Stepson's interview included allusions to\r\ninappropriate touching or bad acts that were done by Beekman to Stepdaughter.\r\nWhile Beekman used the term \"bad acts,\" he only argued the evidence in Stepson's\r\nvideo regarding what transpired between Beekman and Stepdaughter should be\r\nexcluded because Stepson had no independent knowledge, the evidence could only\r\nbe hearsay, and it would result in bolstering. He never challenged these portions of\r\nStepson's video regarding Stepdaughter based upon the improper admission of bad\r\nact evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE, or Lyle.\r\n\nwhich ultimately culminated in Clasby's digital penetration of victim, the offense\r\nfor which Clasby was tried).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.   Cumulative Errors\r\n\r\nFinally, Beekman argues on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to grant\r\nhim a new trial, where the cumulative effect of the errors was so prejudicial as to\r\ndeprive him of a fair trial. He contends, even if this court finds the two previous\r\nerrors do not require reversal, the cumulative effect of those errors in light of the\r\nState's improper comments and arguments was so prejudicial as to deprive him of a\r\nfair trial. He specifically argues, in addition to defense counsel's sustained\r\nobjections,3 three notable instances where he claims the State prejudiced his right\r\nto a fair trial.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe this issue is preserved for our review. Beekman never\r\nspecifically raised the cumulative errors doctrine to the trial court, nor did he even\r\nargue that he was entitled to a new trial based upon errors made during the trial.\r\nRather, he argued for a new trial solely on the basis that the evidence did not\r\nsubstantiate the verdict. See State v. Covert, 368 S.C. 188, 214, 628 S.E.2d 482,\r\n496 (Ct. App. 2006), majority aff'd as modified, 382 S.C. 205, 675 S.E.2d 740\r\n(2009) (wherein the dissent, addressing the issue not reached by the majority based\r\nupon reversal on other grounds, found Covert's argument that a cumulative effect\r\nof errors required reversal of his conviction was not preserved for appeal, even\r\nassuming the presence of errors, as the issue was neither raised to nor ruled on by\r\nthe trial court); cf. Wells v. Halyard, 341 S.C. 234, 240, 533 S.E.2d 341, 344 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2000) (holding, in medical malpractice action, issue of whether cumulative\r\neffect of alleged errors in jury instructions justified new trial was preserved for\r\nappeal where appellant made a motion for new trial asserting several errors\r\nregarding the jury instructions, objected to each alleged error separately during the\r\ncharge and recharge, and objected to errors as a whole during the motion for a new\r\ntrial); see also State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005)\r\n(holding argument advanced on appeal was not raised and ruled on below and\r\ntherefore was not preserved for review); State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 157, 526\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Beekman does not elaborate on the \"sustained objections\" to which he is\r\nreferring.\r\n\nS.E.2d 228, 231 (2000) (noting a defendant may not argue one ground below and\r\nanother on appeal).\r\n\r\nEven assuming the issue is preserved, we nonetheless find no merit to the\r\nargument, as we find no error on the part of the trial court. The cumulative error\r\ndoctrine provides relief to a party when a combination of errors, insignificant by\r\nthemselves, has the effect of preventing the party from receiving a fair trial, and\r\nthe cumulative effect of the errors affects the outcome of the trial. State v.\r\nJohnson, 334 S.C. 78, 93, 512 S.E.2d 795, 803 (1999). An appellant must\r\ndemonstrate more than error in order to qualify for reversal pursuant to the\r\ncumulative error doctrine; rather, he must show the errors adversely affected his\r\nright to a fair trial to qualify for reversal on this ground. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, we have already found no errors in regard to the first two issues raised by\r\nBeekman on appeal. In regard to the other three specific instances he references\r\nunder his cumulative error argument, we find no error on the part of the trial court,\r\nbecause no prejudicial evidence was admitted in one instance and no further\r\nmotion was made or objection asserted on that matter, and because the alleged\r\nerrors were not brought to the trial court's attention in the other two instances. See\r\nState v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 500, 629 S.E.2d 363, 366 (2006) (recognizing\r\naxiomatic rule that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (\"A\r\ncontemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate\r\nreview.\"); State v. Richardson, 358 S.C. 586, 597, 595 S.E.2d 858, 863-64 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2004) (holding issue of whether the trial court erred in permitting the solicitor\r\nto make improper and prejudicial comments to the jury during closing arguments\r\nwas not properly preserved for our review where appellant failed to make any\r\nobjection during closing arguments and failed to move for a mistrial on the ground\r\nof improper argument); State v. Benning, 338 S.C. 59, 63-64, 524 S.E.2d 852, 855\r\n(Ct. App. 1999) (finding the mere asking of improper questions was not prejudicial\r\nwhere no evidence was introduced as a result thereof).\r\n\r\nIn effect, Beekman is asking this court to apply the plain error doctrine by combing\r\nthe record for unpreserved issues and arguing the cumulative effect of these\r\nunpreserved matters deprived him of a fair trial. However, our appellate courts do\r\nnot apply the plain error rule. See State v. Sheppard, 391 S.C. 415, 421, 706\r\nS.E.2d 16, 19 (2011) (noting appellant clearly sought for the appellate court to\r\napply the plain error rule and stating as follows: \"This Court, however, has\r\nroutinely held the plain error rule does not apply in South Carolina state courts.\r\n\nInstead, a party must have a contemporaneous and specific objection to preserve an\r\nissue for appellate review. Thus, Sheppard's argument that a judge commits an\r\nabuse of discretion by not ex mero motu addressing an issue at trial is not\r\nsupported by our case law. Therefore, because Sheppard has not preserved this\r\nissue for review and because this Court does not apply the plain error rule, his\r\nargument fails.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find no error in the trial court's denial of Beekman's motion for severance. As\r\nto the issue concerning prior bad act evidence, we find the issue is not preserved,\r\nand to the extent it is intertwined with the motion for severance, the analysis of that\r\nissue is dispositive. Finally, we find the cumulative errors argument is likewise\r\nunpreserved, and even if it was properly before the court, it fails on the merits\r\nbased upon our affirmance of Issues I and II and Beekman's failure to raise the\r\nissues he argues on appeal to the trial court as to the other errors he asserts.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Beekman's convictions are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5146","title":"State v.

We affirm the trial\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn April 21, 2009, Sobers shot and killed Sebastian Jaramillo (the victim) in\r\nSpartanburg County. Sobers was indicted for murder, and a jury trial was held in\r\nSeptember 2010.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Phoenix Fielder testified he, Travoiris \"Trey\" Gentry, Shaquila \"Quita\"\r\nGentry, Jayquan Hardy, Devon Davis, Ricky Smith, and the victim were at his\r\naunt's house the day of the shooting. According to Phoenix, Devon hit the victim\r\n\"in a playful way\" and a short chase ensued to a nearby cul-de-sac. Phoenix, Trey,\r\nQuita, Jayquan, and Ricky jumped in Phoenix's aunt's car and drove to the cul-de-\r\nsac. Phoenix testified Devon and the victim decided to \"tap box,\"1 and he used his\r\ncell phone to video record the fight. Approximately fifteen people gathered to\r\nwatch the fight. Phoenix stated he saw Sobers sitting in his parked car in the cul-\r\nde-sac, but Sobers was not involved in the fight. According to Phoenix, after the\r\nfight was over Devon and the victim shook hands, and he, Ricky, Quita, Trey, and\r\nthe victim got back in his aunt's car. Phoenix testified he subsequently heard\r\ngunshots and saw Sobers pointing a gun at their car. The victim was sitting in the\r\nback of the car and was shot in the head.\r\n\r\nPhoenix's video was shown to the jury. In addition to the fight, the video showed\r\nTrey and the victim approach Sobers's car before the fight. Trey testified he asked\r\nSobers about disrespectful comments Sobers had allegedly made about his sister.\r\nAccording to Trey, Sobers denied making the comments about his sister and the\r\ntwo shook hands and Trey walked away. Trey testified that after the fight, while\r\nthe group was in the car, he saw Sobers back up his car to face their car and start\r\nshooting.\r\n\r\nJayquan testified he approached Sobers after the fight between Devon and the\r\nvictim but before the shooting. Jayquan asked Sobers \"what was up with him and\r\nTrey getting into it,\" and Sobers told him \"there wouldn't be any fighting.\"\r\nJayquan testified he then saw Sobers reach to his right and pull out a gun. Jayquan\r\nstarted running and testified he heard several gunshots.\r\n\r\nDevon testified he saw Jayquan approach Sobers's car before the shooting. He\r\nstated that after Jayquan walked away from the car, he saw shots fired from\r\nSobers's car. Quita testified she did not see or hear anyone threaten Sobers before\r\nthe shooting. According to Quita, she, Trey, Ricky, Phoenix, and the victim were\r\n                                                            \r\n1   Phoenix described \"tap boxing\" as \"play fighting but not with fists, hands open.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\nall in the car when she saw shots fired from Sobers's car. Ricky also testified he\r\nwas in the car with Quita, Trey, Phoenix, and the victim when Sobers fired at their\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nSobers testified Trey approached his car before the fight between Devon and the\r\nvictim and asked about comments Sobers made about Trey's sister. According to\r\nSobers, after Trey walked away, he assumed \"it was over with\" and \"everything\r\nwas ok.\" Sobers testified he fired shots after Trey approached his car a second\r\ntime and attempted to engage him in a fight. According to Sobers, Trey grabbed\r\nhis shirt through the driver's side window. Sobers stated the others who were\r\nwatching the fight swarmed his car and opened the passenger side doors. Sobers\r\ntestified he shot out of the front passenger door \"because Trey had me,\" but he\r\ndenied shooting directly at anyone. Sobers stated he was \"scared they were going\r\nto kill me.\" Sobers admitted he lied when he told police following the shooting\r\nthat Trey had a gun at the time of the shooting.\r\n\r\nThe jury found Sobers guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006) (citing State v. Wilson, 345\r\nS.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)). \"This [c]ourt is bound by the trial court's\r\nfactual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\" Id. (citing State v.\r\nQuattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.            Gang Activity Evidence\r\n\r\nSobers argues the trial court erred in excluding evidence of gangs and gang activity\r\nat the scene of the shooting. We affirm the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\nPre-trial, defense counsel informed the trial court it would present evidence of\r\ngang activity involving the victim and witnesses. Defense counsel indicated it had\r\npictures from Facebook accounts belonging to Trey and Joshua Fuller2 that showed\r\nthe victim and witnesses flashing gang signs. The State argued the evidence of\r\n                                                            \r\n2   Joshua was not present at the shooting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\ngang activity was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Defense counsel argued the\r\nevidence went \"to self-defense.\" According to defense counsel, Sobers pulled his\r\ngun and fired after the \"mob of people\" who had been watching the fight between\r\nDevon and the victim surrounded his car and tried to pull him out. Defense\r\ncounsel maintained Sobers acted in self-defense because \"those people are gang\r\nmembers\" who had \"just beat down another little boy.\" Defense counsel argued\r\nSobers believed the fight between Devon and the victim was a gang initiation. The\r\ntrial court asked whether any witness statements indicated any gang-related\r\nactivity at the scene of the shooting, and the State responded that none of them did.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found Sobers failed to show the relevance of any possible gang\r\nassociations to the shooting. The trial court noted Sobers's fear was related to the\r\napproaching \"mob,\" not any specific gang associations within the mob. However,\r\nthe trial court left open the possibility that Sobers could offer gang evidence, if he\r\ncould establish the requisite relevancy.\r\n\r\nSobers offered Rocky Watts, a private investigator and former Greenville County\r\nSheriff's deputy, as an expert in gang activity.3 Watts testified that based on the\r\nFacebook photographs, he believed the victim, as well as Quita, Ricky, and Trey,\r\nwere members of a gang. He also testified that based on his experiences in law\r\nenforcement, gangs will \"videotape their activities.\"\r\n\r\nTrey, Ricky, Quita, and Phoenix admitted being in the photographs and making\r\ngang signs, but they all denied being in a gang. Joshua testified the individuals in\r\nthe group photo were not in a gang but were \"just posing\" and \"all being together,\r\nlike we family, all of us akin.\" Thereafter, the State argued (1) no witnesses\r\ntestified they were in a gang, and (2) assuming they were, there was no evidence of\r\na connection between gang activity and the shooting.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the evidence of gang activity presented, the trial court found:\r\n\r\n                             [W]ith respect to the testimony regarding membership by\r\n                             certain witnesses that have testified to be members of a\r\n                             gang, apparently they're all members of different gangs.\r\n                             But based upon what's been presented it's all the same\r\n                             gang if it is a gang. Nevertheless, I fail to see the\r\n                             connection between any membership in a gang if there is\r\n                             one to what occurred on April the 21st 2009. I see no\r\n                                                            \r\n3   The trial court found Watts was not qualified as an expert in gang activity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             connection whatsoever. They were, if you believe the\r\n             testimony of the defendant, acting as a mob. But I still\r\n             fail to see if they were a member of a gang that that has\r\n             any connection with what occurred on April the 21st. So\r\n             based upon there being no connection established, there\r\n             being no relevance to it, there does not appear - that the\r\n             testimony would relate or be relevant to any issue that the\r\n             jury has to decide in this case; and therefore I stand by\r\n             my previous ruling that that is to be excluded.\r\n\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\njudge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\" State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001). \"An\r\nabuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law\r\nor, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.\" State v.\r\nJennings, 394 S.C. 473, 477-78, 716 S.E.2d 91, 93 (2011) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 401, SCRE, \"'relevant evidence' means evidence having the\r\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\r\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be\r\nwithout the evidence.\"\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Sobers argues the gang evidence proffered was relevant to show his\r\nstate of mind and his fear of being killed. The State contends the evidence\r\npresented created only a mere suspicion of gang associations of the victim and\r\nwitnesses. Further, the State maintains the suggestion of gang membership does\r\nnot make any fact of consequence more or less probable.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the evidence\r\nsuggesting gang associations of the victim and witnesses was not relevant. We\r\nnote that although the trial court left open the possibility Sobers could offer gang\r\nevidence if he could establish the requisite relevancy, Sobers never testified the\r\nmob that surrounded his car was part of a gang. According to Sobers, the mob\r\naction caused him to fear for his life and fire his gun, but he never testified he was\r\nmore fearful because the mob was part of a gang. Thus, Sobers never introduced\r\nevidence that would make gang activity relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nII.   Expert Witness\r\n\r\nSobers argues the trial court erred in finding Watts was not qualified as an expert\r\nin gang activity. Based upon our decision to affirm the trial court's exclusion of\r\ntestimony regarding gang activity, we need not address this argument. See Futch\r\nv.

(Mother), appeals an order of the family court\r\nfinding Mother abused and/or neglected her child and ordering Mother's name\r\nentered into the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect (Central Registry).\r\nMother contends the family court erred in (1) finding she abused and neglected her\r\nunborn child based upon conduct that occurred when she did not know she was\r\n\npregnant and ordering her name placed upon the Central Registry, and (2)\r\nimproperly admitting and considering alleged results of drug tests for which there\r\nwas no foundation and which violated the rule against hearsay. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 2011, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a\r\ncomplaint for intervention against Mother. DSS filed an amended complaint for\r\nremoval on July 1, 2011, after Mother and her minor child (Child) allegedly tested\r\npositive for drugs in June 2011. A probable cause hearing was held on July 7,\r\n2011, resulting in an order filed by the family court on July 25, 2011, finding that\r\nprobable cause existed for Child to have been placed in emergency protective\r\ncustody and that Child was to remain in the custody of DSS. In its complaint for\r\nremoval, DSS sought a finding Child was abused and/or neglected by Mother\r\nbased upon Mother's alleged use of cocaine and marijuana in the presence of Child,\r\nresulting in Child testing positive for the drugs as indicated by Child's June 27,\r\n2011 drug test and Mother's June 23, 2011 drug test. DSS also alleged abuse and\r\nneglect of Child by Mother based upon Mother's failure to obtain prenatal care and\r\nher use of drugs during her third trimester of pregnancy with Child, as indicated by\r\nChild's and Mother's positive drug tests at birth. DSS further sought placement of\r\nMother's name on the Central Registry.\r\n\r\nA hearing was held on DSS's complaint on July 28, 2011, at which time the\r\nfollowing was presented: This matter came to the attention of DSS when it\r\nreceived an allegation Mother tested positive for certain drugs when she gave birth\r\nto Child on December 10, 2010. An investigation by DSS revealed Mother\r\nreceived no prenatal care before Child was born. Over Mother's objection, a DSS\r\ncaseworker testified that Mother tested positive for \"benzo, marijuana, [and]\r\nopiates and she had a positive methadone level\" at the time of birth. Upon\r\ninvestigation of the matter, DSS indicated the case on January 18, 2011, for\r\nphysical neglect and abuse, and a treatment plan was implemented for Mother, to\r\ninclude substance abuse treatment with random drug testing along with parenting\r\nclasses. Though home visits revealed no problems as far as Child's care, DSS had\r\nconcerns based on Mother's failure to consistently comply with her treatment plan.1\r\nOver Mother's objection, the DSS caseworker testified Mother and Child were\r\n\r\n1The caseworker noted Mother attended three sessions in March, but missed three\r\nothers in March, as well as all of April, but returned in May after being informed\r\nher case would be going to court.\r\n\ngiven hair strand tests during Mother's treatment, and both Mother and Child \"were\r\npositive.\" Also over Mother's objection, a DSS investigator testified Mother and\r\nChild had a random drug test of their hair, and both tests returned positive.2 On\r\nJune 30, 2011, Child was placed into emergency protective custody and the family\r\ncourt found probable cause to remove Child from Mother's care.\r\n\r\nThe DSS investigator acknowledged that when she originally met with Mother at\r\nthe hospital following Child's birth and questioned her concerning her pregnancy\r\nand prenatal care, while Mother admitted to drug use prior to birth of Child,\r\nMother informed the investigator she was not aware she was pregnant until she\r\nwent to the hospital with stomach pains and delivered Child. The investigator\r\nagreed that during the time she worked with her, Mother was consistent in her\r\nstatement that she did not know she was pregnant. At the time of the hearing,\r\nMother had completed her drug treatment program at Fairfield Behavioral Health\r\nServices (Fairfield Behavioral). The Clinical Counselor at Fairfield Behavioral\r\ntestified Mother submitted to random drug tests on June 6 and June 16, and these\r\ntests were negative for everything except \"benzo.\" However, Mother had provided\r\nthem with a documented prescription for the drug.3 The counselor acknowledged\r\nFairfield Behavioral administered urine drug tests, which would show if a person is\r\n\"actively\" using drugs.4 After speaking with both the DSS caseworker and\r\ninvestigator, Fairfield Behavioral recommended Mother attend parenting skills and\r\nrehabilitative psychological services programs. At the time of the hearing, Mother\r\nhad two more sessions with parenting skills to be completed and had not yet\r\nattended to the psychological services program.\r\n\r\nDSS rested its case, and Mother moved for a directed verdict on the complaint\r\nseeking a finding of abuse and neglect. Mother argued, although there had been\r\nallusions to drug tests, DSS failed to introduce any drug tests to show any\r\nsubstance in Child's system. Mother noted that no drug tests had been admitted\r\ninto evidence because DSS had no witnesses at the hearing to substantiate that any\r\n\r\n2   Mother noted a \"continuing objection as to the references of a positive test.\"\r\n3 The court information sheet and supplemental report, submitted by DSS to the\r\nfamily court, notes that in regard to the circumstances surrounding Child's birth,\r\nMother reported that she had been prescribed the drug Klonopin for her anxiety.\r\n4The counselor's testimony was that if Mother used cocaine, it would last in her\r\nsystem for 48 to 72 hours, marijuana would last from 30 to 45 days, and alcohol\r\nwould last up to 12 hours.\r\n\ntests were taken, that there was a proper chain of custody, that a chemist was\r\nqualified, or that there was not a mix up in the samples in delivery to the testing\r\nsite. Accordingly, Mother argued, since there was no evidence concerning the\r\ndrug reports, the only allegation of Mother's neglect was her failure to get prenatal\r\ncare. However, the DSS caseworker acknowledged Mother did not know she was\r\npregnant at the time. Thus, Mother contended she could not have been neglectful\r\nin failing to obtain prenatal care if she did not know she was pregnant. The family\r\ncourt noted, though Mother stated she did not know she was pregnant, the fact that\r\nshe was pregnant indicated she was having sexual intercourse and the natural\r\noutcome of sexual intercourse is pregnancy. Because Mother admitted having\r\nused drugs and knew she was having sexual intercourse, the court denied the\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nMother then took the stand and testified that she did not know she was pregnant\r\nwith Child. She stated that she had two previous pregnancies and knew what it felt\r\nlike to be pregnant, but her \"body did not have any indications of being pregnant.\"\r\nMother noted that three days before she delivered Child, she pushed a van that had\r\nrun out of gas, something a pregnant woman would not attempt. She also testified,\r\nbecause she did not know she was pregnant, she did not prepare for a baby and did\r\nnot have the things needed for a baby, and her family had to get the items together\r\nwhile she was in the hospital. Mother admitted that, before Child was born and\r\nwithout knowledge of her pregnancy, she engaged in occasional, social drug use\r\nduring the time she was pregnant. On cross-examination by the Guardian ad Litem\r\n(GAL), Mother denied using any drugs since Child came into DSS's custody, other\r\nthan what had been prescribed to her by a doctor.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mother's case, the GAL recalled DSS's caseworker to the stand and\r\nsought to question her about documents previously marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1,\r\nbut not admitted into evidence. The documents were drug tests performed on June\r\n23 and June 27, 2011. When asked what the test results revealed, Mother objected,\r\narguing there was no foundation laid for admission of those results into evidence,\r\nand asserting there was no testimony to establish the qualification of the tests or\r\nchain of custody. The GAL argued the test results were admissible because\r\nMother testified she had not used drugs since Child came into DSS custody \"or\r\n[DSS's] involvement,\" and the evidence was being introduced, not for the truth of\r\nthe matter asserted, but as an exception to hearsay for credibility purposes. Mother\r\ncountered the matter was being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and the\r\ndetermination of credibility was not an exception to the hearsay rule. She further\r\nargued DSS failed to bring in the necessary witnesses to provide a proper\r\nfoundation for admission of the evidence. The family court found the evidence\r\n\nwas being offered, not for the truth of the matter asserted, but was being offered for\r\ncredibility purposes, and overruled the objection. The caseworker then testified\r\nthat Mother's test on June 23, 2011, was positive for cocaine. When asked about\r\nthe test on Child, Mother interposed another objection asserting, even under the\r\nfamily court's ruling concerning admissibility based upon credibility, Child's test\r\nhad nothing to do with Mother's statement that she had not used drugs, and such\r\nwould not challenge the credibility of Mother. The family court sustained this\r\nobjection by Mother. Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 was never offered into evidence.\r\n\r\nAt the close of all evidence, Mother renewed her motion for directed verdict,\r\narguing a failure of proof of the allegations of abuse and neglect, and requesting\r\nthe family court dismiss the case and make no findings of abuse and no neglect and\r\nno finding of placement of Mother's name on the Central Registry. The family\r\ncourt declined to so rule, finding abuse and neglect based upon Mother's admitted\r\nuse of drugs during her pregnancy and the fact that, though Mother denied\r\nknowledge of the pregnancy, her pregnancy was the result of sexual intercourse.\r\nThe court further found Mother's name should be entered into the Central Registry.\r\nThe family court thereafter filed a written order for removal, finding the\r\npreponderance of the evidence supported the allegation Mother abused and/or\r\nneglected Child as defined in section 63-7-20 of the South Carolina Code, and the\r\nnature of the harm was physical abuse and willful and/or reckless neglect, and\r\nMother should therefore be entered into the Central Registry.5\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 2011, Mother filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or\r\namend challenging, among other things, the family court's findings of abuse and/or\r\nneglect and ordering Mother's name be placed on the Central Registry. In\r\nparticular, Mother asserted that the preponderance of the evidence did not support\r\na finding that she physically abused and willfully and/or recklessly neglected\r\nChild, as her conduct prior to Child's birth could not serve as the basis for such\r\nfinding where she had no knowledge of the pregnancy. Mother also filed, on that\r\nday, a motion for review and return of custody. Following a hearing on the\r\nmotions, the family court, by order filed November 4, 2011, denied Mother's\r\n\r\n5This initial order did not specify the basis for finding abuse and neglect or entry\r\nof Mother's name on the Registry, i.e., whether it was for her and Child testing\r\npositive at birth regardless of Mother's knowledge of the pregnancy, or whether it\r\nwas for their testing positive the following June, or whether it was based upon\r\nboth. The family court's oral ruling, however, seems to indicate the ruling was\r\nbased upon Mother's admitted use of drugs during the pregnancy.\r\n\nmotion to alter or amend concerning its findings of abuse and/or neglect.6 In so\r\ndoing, the court found Mother admitted to using illegal drugs during her\r\npregnancy, and though she testified she did not know she was pregnant and\r\ntherefore did not knowingly abuse or neglect Child, the court found her testimony\r\nto lack credibility. The court further found Mother \"participated in activity that\r\nresulted in the creation of an embryo in her body and she knew or should have\r\nknown that she could become pregnant.\" The family court concluded, because this\r\nwas not Mother's first pregnancy, she should have been aware of the physiological\r\nchanges in her body, yet she made no effort to determine if she was pregnant. The\r\nfamily court additionally found that Mother asserted the court had not allowed the\r\n\"drug testing evidence\" on Mother into the record and, therefore, she should not\r\nhave been found to have abused and/or neglected Child; however, the court\r\nconcluded it was in error in not allowing such evidence in the record.7\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.    Whether the family court erred in finding Mother abused and neglected her\r\nunborn child based on conduct that occurred when she did not know she was\r\npregnant.\r\n\r\n2.      Whether the family court erred in ordering Mother entered into the Central\r\nRegistry of Child Abuse and Neglect based on a finding of physical abuse and\r\nwillful and/or reckless neglect.\r\n\r\n3.    Whether the family court erred in admitting hearsay testimony related to\r\nalleged results of drug tests.\r\n\r\n4.    Whether the family court erred in admitting alleged results of drug tests\r\nwithout a proper foundation for admission of those results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6The court continued Mother's motion concerning return of Child to her custody\r\nuntil the GAL had an opportunity to view Mother's home. Thereafter, in early\r\nDecember 2011, the court returned custody of Child to Mother upon agreement of\r\nDSS.\r\n7It is not clear exactly what \"drug testing evidence\" on Mother the family court\r\nwas referring to here.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, an appellate court reviews factual and legal issues\r\nde novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011).\r\n\"De novo review permits appellate court fact-finding, notwithstanding the presence\r\nof evidence supporting the trial court's findings.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381,\r\n390, 709 S.E.2d 650, 654-55 (2011). However, while this court has the authority\r\nto find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence,\r\n\"we recognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\" Id. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655. Further, de novo review does not\r\nrelieve an appellant of his burden to \"demonstrate error in the family court's\r\nfindings of fact.\" Id. \"Consequently, the family court's factual findings will be\r\naffirmed unless appellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of the evidence\r\nis against the finding of the [family] court.\" Id. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655\r\n(alteration in original) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Finding of Abuse and Neglect and Placement on Registry (Issues 1 & 2)\r\n\r\nMother contends the child abuse and neglect provisions of section 63-7-20 do not\r\napply where the uncontradicted evidence shows a mother did not know she was\r\npregnant or have any of the bodily indicators to support a conclusion that she\r\nshould have known she was pregnant. Mother points to the cases of Whitner v.\r\nState, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997) and State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576\r\nS.E.2d 168 (2003) in arguing the court should find the child abuse and neglect\r\nstatutes require a knowledge element before a mother can be found to have\r\ncommitted abuse or neglect. Further, Mother contends the Central Registry statute\r\nimposes such an element, inasmuch as it requires the conduct be willful or reckless\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nMother also argues the family court improperly imputed knowledge based solely\r\non her having engaged in sexual intercourse, and the fact of intercourse alone,\r\nwithout physical symptoms or indicators of pregnancy, should not warrant a\r\nfinding a mother should know she is pregnant. Additionally, Mother asserts the\r\nfamily court's finding in its Rule 59(e), SCRCP order concerning Mother's\r\ncredibility as to her assertion that she did not know she was pregnant is unfounded.\r\nShe argues the only evidence before the court was that Mother did not know she\r\nwas pregnant. Finally, Mother argues DSS failed to introduce competent evidence\r\nto support the admission of drug test results.\r\n\nDSS cites State v. Jenkins, 278 S.C. 219, 294 S.E.2d 44 (1982) for the proposition\r\nthat whether knowledge and intent are necessary elements of a statutory crime\r\nmust be determined from the language of the statute, construed in light of its\r\npurpose and design. DSS contends the fact that the legislature did not include the\r\nword \"knowingly,\" or other apt words to indicate intent or motive are necessary\r\nelements for a violation of section 63-7-20 indicates the legislature intended that a\r\nperson could be found in violation of the statute even if the person had no\r\nknowledge or intent his or her act is criminal. Here, it argues, Mother abused and\r\nneglected her unborn child by engaging in conduct that presented a substantial risk\r\nof harm to the unborn child by using illegal drugs knowing she had engaged in\r\nsexual relations. Thus, Mother knew engaging in such conduct could likely affect\r\nthe life, health or comfort of any child conceived. DSS cites Whitner for the\r\nproposition that a viable fetus is a \"child\" for purposes of the child abuse and\r\nendangerment statute. DSS maintains, once the family court determined Mother\r\nabused or neglected her unborn child, the court was well within its discretion in\r\nfinding her name should be entered into the Central Registry. It contends, while\r\nMother's conduct may not have been \"willful,\" it was \"reckless,\" as Mother's\r\nconduct of using illegal drugs during her pregnancy was in disregard of the\r\npossible harmful consequences to Child.\r\n\r\nSection 63-7-20 of the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n             (4) \"Child abuse or neglect\" or \"harm\" occurs when the\r\n             parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the\r\n             child's welfare:\r\n\r\n                   (a) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child\r\n                   physical or mental injury or engages in acts or\r\n                   omissions which present a substantial risk of\r\n                   physical or mental injury to the child . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-20(4)(a) (2010).\r\n\r\nSection 63-7-1940 provides in part as follows:\r\n\r\n             (A) At a hearing pursuant to Section 63-7-1650 or 63-7-\r\n             1660, at which the court orders that a child be taken or\r\n             retained in custody or finds that the child was abused or\r\n             neglected, the court:\r\n\n                    (1) must order that a person's name be entered in\r\n                    the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect if\r\n                    the court finds that there is a preponderance of\r\n                    evidence that the person physically or sexually\r\n                    abused or wilfully or recklessly neglected the\r\n                    child. Placement on the Central Registry cannot\r\n                    be waived by any party or by the court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1940(A)(1) (2010).\r\n\r\nIn Whitner, our supreme court addressed whether the word \"child,\" as used in\r\nsection 20-7-50 of the South Carolina Children's Code,8 includes a viable fetus.\r\n328 S.C. at 4, 492 S.E.2d at 778. There, Whitner pled guilty to criminal child\r\nneglect after her baby was born with cocaine metabolites in its system based upon\r\nWhitner's ingestion of crack cocaine during her third trimester of pregnancy. Id. at\r\n4, 492 S.E.2d at 778-79. Our supreme court determined, in order for the\r\nsentencing court to have subject matter jurisdiction to accept Whitner's plea under\r\nsection 20-7-50, criminal child neglect under that statute would have to include \"an\r\nexpectant Mother's use of crack cocaine after the fetus is viable.\" Id. at 5, 492\r\nS.E.2d at 779. The majority ultimately concluded section 20-7-50 was \"applicable\r\nto an expectant mother's illegal drug use after the fetus is viable.\" Id. at 15, 492\r\nS.E.2d at 784. The majority further found, because it is common knowledge that\r\nuse of cocaine during pregnancy can harm a viable unborn child, Whitner could\r\nnot claim she lacked fair notice that her behavior of ingesting crack cocaine during\r\nher third trimester of pregnancy was proscribed by section 20-7-50. Id. at 15-16,\r\n492 S.E.2d at 784-85.\r\n\r\nIn McKnight, our supreme court addressed the issue of whether sufficient evidence\r\nof McKnight's criminal intent to commit homicide by child abuse was presented to\r\nsurvive a directed verdict motion, where McKnight asserted no evidence was\r\npresented that she knew the risk that her cocaine use could result in the still birth of\r\nher child. 352 S.C. at 644, 576 S.E.2d at 172-73. Recognizing the court noted in\r\nWhitner that, although the precise effects of maternal crack use during pregnancy\r\nare somewhat unclear, it was \"well documented and within the realm of public\r\nknowledge that such use can cause serious harm to the viable unborn child,\" and\r\nthis common knowledge put Whitner on notice that her conduct in utilizing\r\n\r\n8Section 20-7-50 was the predecessor to current code section 63-5-70, which\r\nproscribes unlawful conduct toward a child. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-5-70 (2010).\r\n\ncocaine during pregnancy constituted child endangerment. Id. at 645, 576 S.E.2d\r\nat 173. In McKnight's case, it was undisputed that she took cocaine on numerous\r\noccasions while she was pregnant, and McKnight admitted to the DSS investigator\r\nthat she knew she was pregnant and that she had been using cocaine when she\r\ncould get it. Id. at 645-46, 576 S.E.2d at 173. The court then held, \"Given the fact\r\nthat it is public knowledge that usage of cocaine is potentially fatal, we find the\r\nfact that McKnight took cocaine knowing she was pregnant was sufficient\r\nevidence to submit to the jury on whether she acted with extreme indifference to\r\nher child's life.\" Id. at 646, 576 S.E.2d at 173 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn Jenkins, the defendant was convicted of the misdemeanor crime of unlawful\r\nneglect of a child, in violation of section 16-3-1030 9 of the South Carolina Code,\r\nafter she left her eight year-old and five year-old sleeping alone in the house for an\r\nhour, and the two children died in a fire during that time. 278 S.C. at 220-21, 294\r\nS.E.2d at 45. In addressing whether the statute required proof of criminal\r\nnegligence, as opposed to simple negligence, our supreme court noted that the\r\nlegislature may forbid the doing of an act and make its commission criminal\r\nwithout regard to the intent or knowledge of the doer, and the knowledge or\r\nignorance of the act's criminal character is immaterial on the question of guilt. Id.\r\nat 221-22, 294 S.E.2d at 45. The court must look to the language of the statute,\r\nconstrued in light of its purpose and design, to determine whether knowledge and\r\nintent are necessary elements of a statutory crime. Id. at 222 , 294 S.E.2d at 45.\r\nNoting the statute in question was enacted to provide protection for those persons\r\nwhose tender years or helplessness rendered them incapable of self-protection, the\r\ncourt concluded the legislature's failure to include \"knowingly\" or other apt words\r\nto indicate criminal intent or motive evidenced \"the legislature intended that one\r\nwho simply, without knowledge or intent that his act is criminal, fails to provide\r\nproper care and attention for a child or helpless person of whom he has legal\r\ncustody, so that the life, health, and comfort of that child or helpless person is\r\nendangered or is likely to be endangered, violates § 16-3-1030 of the Code.\" Id. at\r\n222, 294 S.E.2d at 45-46. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHere, there is little doubt that Mother engaged in acts or omissions which\r\npresented a substantial risk of physical injury to Child based upon her admission of\r\ndrug use prior to Child's birth, and such acts could qualify as child abuse or\r\nneglect. See Whitner, 492 S.E.2d at 15, 492 S.E.2d at 784 (holding child neglect\r\n\r\n9This statute was repealed and similar provisions appeared in section 20-7-50. Id.\r\nat 220 n.1, 294 S.E.2d at 45 n.1. As we previously noted, section 20-7-50 is the\r\npredecessor to current code section 63-5-70.\r\n\nunder the criminal child neglect statute would include an expectant mother's illegal\r\ndrug use after the fetus is viable). Further, Mother could be susceptible to a\r\nfinding of abuse and/or neglect under section 63-7-20, regardless of whether she\r\nhad intent to harm Child through her drug use, or knowledge of the possible harm\r\nto Child from her drug use. See McKnight, 352 S.C. at 645, 576 S.E.2d at 173\r\n(finding, even if no evidence was presented that McKnight knew the risk that her\r\ncocaine use could result in the still birth of her child, common knowledge that such\r\nuse can cause serious harm to a viable unborn child is sufficient to put one on\r\nnotice that conduct in utilizing cocaine during pregnancy constitutes child\r\nendangerment); Jenkins, 278 S.C. at 222, 294 S.E.2d at 45-46 (holding the\r\nlegislature's failure to include \"knowingly\" or other apt words to indicate criminal\r\nintent or motive evidenced the legislature's intent that one who, without knowledge\r\nor intent that his act is criminal, fails to provide proper care and attention for a\r\nchild or helpless person of whom he has legal custody, so that the life, health, and\r\ncomfort of that child or helpless person is endangered or is likely to be endangered,\r\nviolates the criminal statute proscribing unlawful neglect of a child). However,\r\nwe do not believe Mother can be found to have abused and/or neglected Child\r\npursuant to section 63-7-20 where there is no evidence Mother knew or should\r\nhave known that she was pregnant with a viable fetus at the time of her drug use.\r\nThough knowledge that her actions could harm Child is not necessary for a finding\r\nof abuse and/or neglect, this is not the same as knowledge that a child who could\r\nbe harmed actually exists.\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's primary function is to\r\nascertain legislative intent, and, where a statute is complete, plain, and\r\nunambiguous, legislative intent must be determined from the language of the\r\nstatute itself. Whitner, 328 S.C. at 6, 492 S.E.2d at 779. \"A statute as a whole\r\nmust receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the\r\npurpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.\" Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy\r\nExam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606 (2006). \"Any ambiguity in a\r\nstatute should be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of\r\nthe law.\" State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 351, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010) (quoting\r\nBennett v. Sullivan's Island Bd. of Adjustment, 313 S.C. 455, 458, 438 S.E.2d 273,\r\n274 (Ct. App. 1993)). Further, our courts will reject any interpretation which\r\nwould lead to a result so absurd that the legislature could not have intended it. Id.;\r\nsee also S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 78, 459 S.E.2d 846, 849\r\n(1995) (noting our courts will interpret statutes so as to promote legislative intent\r\nand escape absurd results).\r\n\nSection 63-1-20 of the South Carolina Code states \"[i]t shall be the policy of this\r\nState to concentrate on the prevention of children's problems as the most important\r\nstrategy which can be planned and implemented on behalf of children and their\r\nfamilies.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-1-20(C) (2010). It is difficult to see how a finding\r\nof abuse or neglect or inclusion of a person's name on the Central Registry for\r\ningestion of harmful drugs during pregnancy will promote the prevention of\r\nchildren's problems where the mother is not aware of the pregnancy at the time of\r\nher drug use.\r\n\r\nFurther, we believe our case law supports this interpretation of the statute. Though\r\nWhitner and Jenkins both involved interpretation of legislative intent of criminal\r\nstatutes, the policy behind these statutes clearly involved the protection of children\r\nand prevention of harm to them. Thus, we find inconsequential the fact that these\r\ncases involved statutes providing punishment for criminal conduct, and find no\r\nmerit to DSS's attempt to distinguish McKnight on this basis.\r\n\r\nIn McKnight, our supreme court specifically noted it was undisputed that\r\nMcKnight took cocaine on numerous occasions while she was pregnant, and\r\nMcKnight admitted to the DSS investigator that she knew she was pregnant and\r\nthat she had been using cocaine when she could get it. The court then held, given\r\nthat it is public knowledge that usage of cocaine during pregnancy is potentially\r\nfatal, the fact that McKnight took cocaine knowing she was pregnant was sufficient\r\nevidence of McKnight's criminal intent to commit homicide by child abuse to\r\nsubmit the matter to the jury.\r\n\r\nHere, the only evidence presented was that Mother did not know she was pregnant\r\nuntil she gave birth to Child. Though the family court, in its order denying\r\nMother's motion to amend, made a finding that Mother's testimony in this regard\r\nlacked credibility, we believe this finding is against the preponderance of the\r\nevidence. Mother adamantly denied knowing she was pregnant with Child until\r\nChild's birth. She testified that she had two previous pregnancies and knew what it\r\nfelt like to be pregnant, but her \"body did not have any indications of being\r\npregnant\" with Child, that three days prior to delivering Child she engaged in\r\nphysical activity a pregnant woman would not attempt, and she had no items at\r\nhome that a pregnant woman would normally obtain in anticipation of the birth of\r\na child. Further, the DSS investigator who met with Mother at the hospital\r\nfollowing Child's birth testified Mother informed her that she was not aware she\r\nwas pregnant until she went to the hospital with stomach pains and delivered\r\nChild. This investigator also agreed that, during the time she worked with her,\r\nMother was consistent in her statement that she did not know she was pregnant.\r\n\nAdditionally, the court information sheet/supplemental reports submitted by DSS\r\nto the family court in conjunction with its filings indicate Mother reported during\r\nthe investigation that she did not receive prenatal care because she did not know\r\nshe was pregnant, she presented to the hospital emergency room in severe pain\r\nafter pain medication she had received from a friend did not relieve her pain, and\r\nwhile in the restroom of the hospital, she gave birth to Child. At no time did DSS\r\npresent any evidence Mother knew, or should have known, she was pregnant\r\nbefore the birth of Child. Nor did DSS ever argue to the family court that Mother\r\nknew or should have known she was pregnant prior to the birth, or maintain\r\nMother was not credible in this respect. Accordingly, we hold this finding by the\r\nfamily court is against the greater weight or preponderance of the evidence.\r\n\r\nWe likewise give no credence to the family court's determination that Mother's\r\nparticipation in sexual activity alone was sufficient to show she knew or should\r\nhave known she \"could become pregnant.\" The circumstances surrounding Mother\r\nbecoming pregnant were not explored at all during the hearing.10 Thus, we do not\r\nbelieve that the family court's reasoning that Mother became pregnant, and,\r\ntherefore, must have engaged in sexual activity, is sufficient to show she knew or\r\nshould have known she was pregnant. Nor do we believe the fact that Mother\r\n\"could become pregnant\" is adequate to expose her to a finding of abuse and/or\r\nneglect of a child. Additionally, we find no support for the family court's\r\nconclusion that, because it was not Mother's first pregnancy, she should have been\r\naware of the physiological changes occurring in her body, but she made no effort\r\nto determine if she was pregnant. 11\r\n\r\n10 For example, no evidence was presented concerning Mother's possible use of\r\ncontraceptives, whether she had reason to believe she would not become pregnant\r\nas the result of any sexual encounter at that time, or whether she had experienced\r\nany false negative pregnancy tests thereafter. A likely explanation for this is that\r\nDSS did not contest Mother's assertion that she was unaware of the pregnancy, or\r\nattempt to show that Mother should have known or suspected that she was\r\npregnant prior to the birth of Child.\r\n11Despite the family court's apparent personal belief that a woman who has been\r\nthrough a previous pregnancy would have been aware of physiological changes in\r\nher body, it is common knowledge that women can carry a pregnancy full term\r\nwith no idea that they were pregnant. Discovery Fit & Health even has a show\r\nabout such situations. http://health.discovery.com/tv/i-didnt-know-i-was-\r\npregnant/. This website includes a list of ten reasons a woman might not know she\r\nwas pregnant until she was in labor. http://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-\r\n\nInterpreting section 63-7-20 so as to promote legislative intent and escape absurd\r\nresults, and resolving any ambiguity in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial\r\noperation of the law, we believe the family court erred in finding Mother abused\r\nand neglected Child where the evidence shows Mother did not know or have\r\nreason to know she was pregnant at the time of the conduct upon which the alleged\r\nabuse and/or neglect was based. Under the family court's ruling in this matter,\r\nevery woman who engages in sexual intercourse and becomes pregnant as a result\r\ncould be found to have abused and neglected her unborn child based upon any\r\nconduct potentially harmful to the unborn child, even though the woman had no\r\nknowledge of her pregnancy. We agree with Mother that her conduct, prior to the\r\nbirth of Child, should not serve as a basis for a finding of abuse or neglect where\r\nthe evidence shows she had no knowledge and there is no evidence she had reason\r\nto know of the pregnancy at the time of the conduct. Based upon the above\r\nreasons, we likewise find the family court erred in ordering Mother's placement on\r\nthe Central Registry pursuant to section 63-7-1940.\r\n\r\nB.    Admission of Evidence Relating to Drug Tests (Issues 3 & 4)\r\n\r\nMother next contends the family court erred in admitting any evidence related to\r\ndrug tests conducted at the time of birth and in June 2011, and such evidence could\r\nnot be considered on the question of whether DSS met its burden of proof. She\r\nargues the family court erred in admitting hearsay testimony related to alleged\r\nresults of drug tests, as well as in admitting alleged results of drug tests without a\r\nproper foundation for admission of those results. In regard to evidence concerning\r\nthe alleged test results at the time of birth, Mother notes DSS did not offer the\r\nwritten report of the drug tests into evidence and failed to offer any evidence\r\nconcerning the circumstances surrounding the results of those tests. As to the June\r\n2011 alleged drug tests, Mother argues DSS had the two written reports marked for\r\nidentification, but DSS never sought to admit the reports into evidence and, again,\r\nfailed to offer any evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding those test\r\nresults. Mother maintains DSS did not even attempt to lay a proper foundation for\r\n\r\nand-parenting/pregnancy/issues/10-reasons-you-might-not-know-you-are-\r\npregnant.htm. Mother's testimony that she had been previously pregnant and knew\r\nthe symptoms of pregnancy yet her body did not show these indications supports\r\nthat she did not know she was pregnant. As noted, the credibility of this testimony\r\nwas not challenged by DSS. Further, as previously noted, there was no evidence\r\npresented concerning whether Mother made any effort to determine if she was\r\npregnant before the birth.\r\n\nany of the drug test evidence, and that she was deprived of the opportunity to\r\nchallenge the reliability of the drug test evidence. Accordingly, Mother argues all\r\nof the drug test evidence was inadmissible and none of it should be considered in\r\nreviewing her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for a finding of abuse or\r\nneglect and for entry on the Central Registry.\r\n\r\nDSS does not argue in its brief against Mother's assertion that the drug test\r\nevidence was inadmissible. Rather, it argues, though \"the family court may have\r\nerred in admission of drug test evidence,\" Mother was not prejudiced by the\r\nadmission of such evidence. DSS notes the caseworker testified Mother had freely\r\nadmitted to her illegal drug use prior to Child's birth, and Mother, in her own\r\ntestimony, admitted to her use of illegal drugs prior to the birth. Thus, DSS\r\nmaintains there was sufficient evidence regarding Mother's use of illegal drugs\r\nduring her pregnancy for the court to make a finding of abuse or neglect and for\r\nthe court to order entry of Mother's name on the Central Registry. In its brief, DSS\r\nmaintains Mother's admission of her illegal drug use was the basis for the family\r\ncourt's findings in this regard.\r\n\r\nWe have already determined that Mother's conduct prior to the birth of Child could\r\nnot serve as a basis for a finding of abuse or neglect or placement on the Central\r\nRegistry where the evidence shows Mother had no knowledge or reason to know of\r\nthe pregnancy at the time of the conduct. Thus, accepting DSS's assertion in its\r\nbrief that the trial court's ruling was based upon Mother's admitted drug use while\r\npregnant, the drug test evidence on Mother and Child at the time of Child's birth is\r\ninconsequential and cannot serve as a basis for the family court's finding.\r\nAccordingly, we need not reach the issue concerning the admission of drug test\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nAt oral argument, however, DSS backed away from the stance it took in its brief\r\nthat the family court's decision was based upon Mother's use of drugs while\r\npregnant. Nonetheless, we find no properly admitted evidence to support a finding\r\nof abuse or neglect from any of the subsequent June 2011 testing.\r\n\r\nTestimony concerning the June 2011 test result on Child was not admitted, and the\r\nfamily court did not thereafter reverse its ruling concerning the inadmissibility of\r\nevidence on Child's June 2011 test result. Thus, the only evidence ultimately\r\n\nadmitted by the family court concerning the June 2011 drug test results related\r\nsolely to Mother.12\r\n\r\nTo the extent the family court may have relied on evidence concerning Mother's\r\nJune 2011 drug test results to make its finding of abuse or neglect and ordering\r\nMother's name be placed on the Central Registry, a thorough review of the record\r\nconvinces us there was no properly admitted evidence to support such a\r\ndetermination.13 Further, even if properly admitted, the evidence of Mother's June\r\n\r\n12Even if it could be argued the trial court admitted, or intended to admit, the June\r\n2011 drug test evidence on Child, we find such admission would have been\r\nimproper against Mother's timely and consistent objections based on hearsay and\r\nfoundation. DSS made no attempt to lay any foundation whatsoever for the\r\nadmission of testimony on the results of these tests. There is no evidence the\r\nwitnesses had any personal knowledge that would qualify them to testify as to the\r\nresults or validity of the drug tests, nor is there any indication that such tests results\r\nwere admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule, such as a business records\r\nexception. See Rule 801(c), SCRE (\"'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made\r\nby the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove\r\nthe truth of the matter asserted.\"); Rule 802, SCRE (\"Hearsay is not admissible\r\nexcept as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme\r\nCourt of this State or by statute.\"); Rule 803(6), SCRE (often cited as the business\r\nrecords exception, providing the following is not excluded by the hearsay rule:\r\n\"Records of Regularly Conducted Activity. A memorandum, report, record, or\r\ndata compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, or diagnoses, made at or\r\nnear the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if\r\nkept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the\r\nregular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record,\r\nor data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other\r\nqualified witness, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances\r\nof preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness . . . .\"); State v. Rich, 293 S.C. 172,\r\n173, 359 S.E.2d 281, 281 (1987) (holding, even where evidence may be admissible\r\nunder an exception to the hearsay rule, such will not absolve the offering party\r\nfrom the usual requirements of authentication).\r\n13 As to admission of evidence concerning the drug testing of Mother's hair in June\r\n2011, the family court erred in determining it was admissible based on the judge's\r\nfinding it went to Mother's credibility. Regardless of DSS's motive in seeking\r\nadmission of the evidence, if the evidence was being admitted to prove that Mother\r\nlied about her subsequent drug use, it was being admitted to prove the truth of the\r\n\n2011 drug test results would be irrelevant to abuse and neglect of Child, as there\r\nwas no evidence that such drug use by Mother at that time resulted in any abuse or\r\nneglect of Child.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the family court erred in finding Mother abused and neglected her unborn\r\nChild based upon conduct occurring while Mother did not know or have reason to\r\nknow she was pregnant. Further, the only evidence admitted by the family court\r\nsubsequent to Child's birth concerning drug tests related only to Mother; this\r\nevidence was improperly admitted based upon Mother's hearsay and foundation\r\nobjections; and, even if properly admitted, there was no evidence any subsequent\r\ndrug use by Mother caused abuse or neglect of Child. Accordingly, the family\r\ncourt's finding of abuse and neglect and ordering placement of Mother's name on\r\nthe Central Registry is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter asserted. See Rule 801(c), SCRE (\"'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one\r\nmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to\r\nprove the truth of the matter asserted.\"); Rule 802, SCRE (\"Hearsay is not\r\nadmissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the\r\nSupreme Court of this State or by statute.\"). Further, we do not believe Mother's\r\nJune 2011 test result necessarily serves to impeach Mother. On cross-examination,\r\nMother was asked if she \"[had] used drugs since [Child] has come into [DSS's]\r\ncustody\" to which Mother responded she had only used what had been prescribed\r\nby a doctor. Child did not go into DSS's custody until after Child was placed into\r\nemergency protective custody on June 30, 2011, after the June drug test. Mother\r\ndid not, as was argued to the family court, claim she had not used drugs since\r\nDSS's involvement with Child, as she was only asked about drug use subsequent to\r\nChild being placed in DSS custody. Lastly, the family court addressed the\r\nadmissibility of evidence of Mother's drug test result on the basis of hearsay,\r\nfinding that it went to Mother's credibility, but it did not address the objection\r\nmade by Mother as to the lack of foundation for the evidence and failure of DSS to\r\npresent evidence concerning the validity of the test results. See Rich, 293 S.C. at\r\n173, 359 S.E.2d at 281 (holding, even where evidence may be admissible under an\r\nexception to the hearsay rule, such will not absolve the offering party from the\r\nusual requirements of authentication).\r\n\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.

Dukes argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress an\r\neyewitness's identification of Dukes for two reasons: (1) the pretrial hearing did\r\nnot comport with due process because the detective who conducted the\r\nidentification procedure was unavailable to testify; and (2) the identification\r\n\nprocedure was impermissibly suggestive and created a substantial likelihood of\r\nmisidentification. We affirm.\r\n\r\n         I.    Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 2, 2007, Cornelius Ford witnessed Gowans' murder.\r\nThat afternoon, Ford met with Detective Sean Addison at the Conway Police\r\nDepartment and identified Dukes as the shooter.\r\n\r\nBefore trial, Dukes asked the court to suppress Ford's out-of-court identification\r\nbecause the identification procedure used was impermissibly suggestive. The trial\r\ncourt conducted a hearing, where the State called Ford to testify to what happened\r\nwhen he made the identification. Ford told the court he went to the police station\r\nwith his father after the shooting to give a statement. After Ford gave a description\r\nof the shooter, Addison suggested Ford look at photographs, \"like a photo book,\"\r\nto see if he could identify the person who shot Gowans. When Addison got up\r\nfrom the table to get the photo book, Ford saw other photographs in a file Addison\r\nhad on the table. Ford identified Dukes from one of the photographs he saw in\r\nAddison's file. Ford testified Addison did not present the photos to him or instruct\r\nhim to choose one.\r\n\r\nThe State then called Ford's father, Rasheed Muhammad, who was present when\r\nFord made the identification. Muhammad told the court Addison offered to show a\r\nbook of photographs to Ford, but before that occurred, \"[photographs] were put on\r\nthe table.\" From those photographs, Ford identified Dukes. Muhammad testified\r\nAddison did not suggest which photograph Ford should select.\r\n\r\nDukes presented no witnesses but read an excerpt of Addison's investigative report,\r\nin which Addison wrote \"the photos were presented to . . . Ford one at a time.\"1\r\nDukes asserted that because Addison's report contradicted Ford's recollection of\r\nwhat happened, \"the State [could] not meet its burden\" of showing the\r\nidentification procedure was not impermissibly suggestive without Addison's\r\ntestimony.2\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Addison's investigative report was not entered into evidence.\r\n2Addison was unavailable because he was serving on active military duty in\r\nAfghanistan at the time of trial.\r\n\nThe trial court ruled it was not \"necessary for the court to hear [Addison's]\r\ntestimony,\" and denied Dukes' motion, stating:\r\n\r\n             It does not appear, even taking into consideration the\r\n             report of [Addison], that there was any corrupting effect,\r\n             that there was any intentional act, that there was any\r\n             deliberate act, there was any act by the police of a\r\n             suggestive manner. . . . The seeing of the photographs\r\n             was either done accidently through the looking at a file or\r\n             in the process that the Court finds was not suggestive in\r\n             any manner . . . .\r\n\r\nAt trial, Ford and Muhammad testified to Ford's out-of-court identification of\r\nDukes. Ford also gave an in-court identification. The jury found Dukes guilty of\r\nmurder, and the court sentenced him to forty-seven years in prison.\r\n\r\n      II.    Identification Evidence\r\n\r\nAn out-of-court identification of the defendant violates due process and must be\r\nsuppressed when the identification procedure used by police was impermissibly\r\nsuggestive and conducive to a substantial likelihood of misidentification. State v.\r\nLiverman, 398 S.C. 130, 138, 727 S.E.2d 422, 425 (2012). A witness's subsequent\r\nin-court identification is inadmissible \"if a suggestive out-of-court identification\r\nprocedure created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\"\r\nState v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 81, 600 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2004) (emphasis added);\r\nsee also Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198, 93 S. Ct. 375, 381, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401,\r\n410 (1972) (\"While the phrase ['a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\r\nmisidentification'] was coined as a standard for determining whether an in-court\r\nidentification would be admissible . . . , with the deletion of 'irreparable' it serves\r\nequally well as a standard for the admissibility of testimony concerning the out-of-\r\ncourt identification itself.\").\r\n\r\nTrial courts employ a two-pronged inquiry to determine whether due process\r\nrequires suppression of an out-of-court eyewitness identification. Liverman, 398\r\nS.C. at 138, 727 S.E.2d at 426. First, the court must determine whether the\r\nidentification resulted from \"unnecessarily suggestive\" police procedures. Biggers,\r\n409 U.S. at 198-99, 93 S. Ct. at 381-82, 34 L. Ed. 2d at 410-11; see also Perry v.\r\nNew Hampshire, 132 S. Ct. 716, 721 n.1, 181 L. Ed. 2d 694, 703 n.1 (2012)\r\n(stating \"what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unnecessarily\r\nsuggestive identification procedure\"); Liverman, 398 S.C. at 138, 727 S.E.2d at\r\n\n426 (stating the standard for impermissible suggestiveness as whether the police\r\nprocedures were \"unnecessary and unduly suggestive\"); Traylor, 360 S.C. at 81,\r\n600 S.E.2d at 526 (stating the standard as whether the police procedures were\r\n\"unduly suggestive\"). If the court finds the identification did not result from\r\nimpermissibly suggestive police procedures, the inquiry ends there and the court\r\ndoes not need to consider the second prong. See United States v. Sanders, 708\r\nF.3d 976, 984 (7th Cir. 2013) (citing Perry for the proposition that \"courts will\r\nonly consider the second prong if a challenged procedure does not pass muster\r\nunder the first\"). If the court finds, however, that the police used an impermissibly\r\nsuggestive identification procedure, it must then determine whether the\r\nidentification was nevertheless \"so reliable that no substantial likelihood of\r\nmisidentification existed.\" Liverman, 398 S.C. at 138, 727 S.E.2d at 426 (citing\r\nBiggers, 409 U.S. at 199, 93 S. Ct. at 382, 34 L. Ed. 2d at 411).\r\n\r\n             A.    The Sufficiency of the Hearing\r\n\r\nDukes argues the suppression hearing conducted by the trial court did not comport\r\nwith due process because \"the State could not meet its burden\" of showing the\r\nidentification procedure was not impermissibly suggestive without Detective\r\nAddison's testimony. We hold Addison's absence from the hearing did not violate\r\nDukes' due process rights.\r\n\r\nProcedural due process requires \"adequate notice of the proceeding, the\r\nopportunity to be heard in person, the opportunity to introduce evidence, the right\r\nto confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and the right to meaningful\r\njudicial review.\" Dangerfield v. State, 376 S.C. 176, 179, 656 S.E.2d 352, 354\r\n(2008). It does not, however, require any particular form of procedure. See S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 352 S.C. 445, 452, 574 S.E.2d 730, 733 (2002)\r\n(stating \"due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\r\nparticular situation demands\" (citation and quotation marks omitted)). Due process\r\nalso does not require all witnesses to testify. See United States v. Morsley, 454 F.\r\nApp'x 191, 193 (4th Cir. 2011) (stating the constitution \"does not by its terms grant\r\nto a criminal defendant the right to secure the attendance and testimony of any and\r\nall witnesses\" (citation omitted)). \"The fundamental requirement of due process is\r\nthe opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"\r\nWilson, 352 S.C. at 452, 574 S.E.2d at 734.\r\n\r\nDukes argues he was denied due process because the key witness, the investigating\r\nofficer, was unavailable to testify. We disagree and hold the trial court afforded\r\nDukes all that due process required in this particular situation. The trial court gave\r\n\nDukes notice of the hearing and the opportunity to be present. The court also gave\r\nhim the opportunity to cross-examine the State's witnesses, offer his own evidence,\r\nand argue his position. Dukes argued the specific reasons Addison's testimony was\r\nessential, but the trial court determined otherwise, specifically stating, \"I find it is\r\nnot necessary for the court to make the determination on your motion to suppress\r\nthe identification to have the testimony of the officer in this particular case.\" Thus,\r\nthe trial court was able to determine from the testimony of the State's witnesses\r\nthat nothing the police did was suggestive. Finally, this appeal is Dukes'\r\nopportunity for judicial review. We find the hearing did not violate Dukes' due\r\nprocess rights.\r\n\r\nIn Liverman, our supreme court addressed the sufficiency of a suppression hearing\r\nfor identification evidence. The specific issue the court addressed was whether a\r\ntrial court must conduct a \"full\" inquiry into the reliability of the evidence when\r\nthe police procedure is impermissibly suggestive, but the eyewitness knew the\r\naccused before the identification procedure was conducted. See 398 S.C. at 134,\r\n727 S.E.2d at 423 (\"The case before us involves the intersection of a suggestive\r\npolice show-up identification procedure and an eyewitness who knows the\r\naccused.\"). Relying on Perry, the court held that \"pretrial judicial review [is\r\nnecessary] when an identification is infected by improper police influence.\" 398\r\nS.C. at 140, 727 S.E.2d at 427. Thus, the court held a suppression hearing is\r\nrequired to determine the reliability of the suggestive identification even though\r\nthe eyewitness previously knew the defendant. Id. On the facts before it, the\r\nLiverman court \"decline[d] to hold that the pretrial hearing fully comported with\r\ndue process requirements\" but found that any error was harmless. 398 S.C. at 141,\r\n727 S.E.2d at 427.\r\n\r\nTo explain our holding that the hearing in this case did comport with due process,\r\nit is important to note how this case is different from Liverman. The police\r\nprocedure in Liverman was the classic show-up lineup, 398 S.C. at 133-35, 727\r\nS.E.2d at 423-24, which our courts have held are impermissibly suggestive in most\r\ncircumstances. See State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2000)\r\n(stating \"[s]ingle person show-ups are particularly disfavored in the law,\" and\r\nholding on facts very similar to Liverman that \"it is patent the show-up procedure\r\nused was unduly suggestive\"). Liverman arose, therefore, under the second prong\r\nof Biggers—reliability. We decide this appeal under the first prong—\r\nsuggestiveness. Under Perry and Liverman, judicial inquiry into reliability is\r\nrequired every time the police orchestrate a suggestive identification procedure.\r\nUnder Perry and cases like Sanders, however, judicial inquiry into reliability is\r\nnever required unless (1) the police (2) orchestrated an identification procedure (3)\r\n\nthat was impermissibly suggestive. Perry and Sanders remove this case from the\r\nambit of Liverman because the trial court here found there was no impermissibly\r\nsuggestive police conduct.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean, however, that Dukes was not entitled to a hearing that\r\nprovided all the elements of due process. It does mean that the sufficiency of the\r\nhearing is governed by traditional concepts of procedural due process, not by the\r\ndue-process-based duty of the court to inquire into the reliability of evidence upon\r\nwhich Liverman was decided. Liverman, 398 S.C. at 140, 727 S.E.2d at 427\r\n(noting Perry \"reemphasized the [due-process-based] necessity of pretrial judicial\r\nreview when an identification is infected by improper police influence\"). In this\r\ncase, the trial court was not able to determine exactly what Addison did. However,\r\nthe court was able to determine that either Ford saw the photographs accidentally\r\nor Addison showed them to him one at a time. The court then determined that\r\nneither of those alternatives involved suggestive police conduct. Our holding that\r\nAddison's absence from the hearing did not deprive Dukes of due process,\r\nespecially given the alternative nature of the trial court's ruling, is dependent on the\r\nfact that the issue here is suggestiveness—not reliability. We do not address\r\nwhether a key witness's presence would have been necessary for the court to fulfill\r\nits duty to inquire into reliability if the court had determined the police conduct\r\nwas unnecessarily suggestive. See 398 S.C. at 140, 727 S.E.2d at 427 (\"'The\r\nfallibility of eyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state\r\nconduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen such evidence\r\nfor reliability before allowing the jury to assess its creditworthiness.'\" (quoting\r\nPerry, 132 S. Ct. at 728, 181 L. Ed. 2d at 711)).\r\n\r\n             B.     The Suggestiveness of the Identification Procedure\r\n\r\nDukes also argues the trial court erred in finding the out-of-court identification\r\nprocedure used by the police was not unnecessarily suggestive. He initially frames\r\nhis argument in terms of the burden of proof, contending that because Addison was\r\nunavailable to testify, the State could not meet its burden.\r\n\r\nWe decline to resolve this issue in terms of whether the trial court properly applied\r\nthe burden of proof. First, our supreme court has never placed the burden of\r\ndisproving suggestiveness on the State. The Fourth Circuit, whose decisions\r\n\nregarding federal constitutional law are binding on us,3 has held the defendant\r\nbears the burden of proving the identification procedure was impermissibly\r\nsuggestive. See United States v. Saunders, 501 F.3d 384, 389 (4th Cir. 2007)\r\n(\"[T]he defendant must show that the photo identification procedure was\r\nimpermissibly suggestive.\").4 Second, it appears the trial court did place the\r\n\r\n3State v. Ford Motor Co., 208 S.C. 379, 390, 38 S.E.2d 242, 247 (1946) (stating\r\n\"federal [cases] . . . are controlling of the meaning and effect of the Federal\r\nConstitution\").\r\n4 Accord Perry, 132 S.

At the beginning of the hearing, Dukes' counsel\r\nstated, \"The State can't prove its burden and it's suggestive.\" The State then put up\r\nits evidence. Under these circumstances, the question of whether the burden of\r\nproof was properly applied makes no difference because the trial court applied it in\r\nthe manner most beneficial to Dukes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we review the trial court's ruling—that the procedure used was not\r\nsuggestive—to determine whether it is supported by the evidence. Ford and\r\nMuhammad testified to how Ford identified Dukes and particularly to Addison's\r\nconduct during the procedure. Dukes presented no witnesses but described the\r\ncontents of Addison's investigative report, which contradicted Ford and\r\nMuhammad's testimony. Dukes argues this evidentiary discrepancy demonstrates\r\nthere is insufficient evidence for the court to determine whether the procedure was\r\nimpermissibly suggestive. We disagree. While Addison's testimony would have\r\nbeen helpful, the court found the testimony of Ford and Muhammad sufficient for\r\nit to determine the procedure was not suggestive. In doing so, the court considered\r\nthe discrepancy in the evidence:\r\n\r\n             It does not appear, even taking into consideration the\r\n             report of the investigator, that there was any corrupting\r\n             effect, that there was any intentional act, that there was\r\n             any deliberate act, there was any act by the police of a\r\n             suggestive manner.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the existence of contradictory evidence, the trial court had the\r\nresponsibility to determine whether the identification procedure was suggestive.\r\nWe find evidence to support the trial court's decision, and thus the court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in ruling the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. See\r\nLiverman, 398 S.C. at 138, 727 S.E.2d at 425 (stating \"the decision to admit an\r\n\r\nC.J.S. Criminal Law § 1104 (2006) (\"[T]he defendant has the initial burden to\r\nshow an improper or unreliable procedure or identification . . . .\"). C.f. People v.\r\nJackson, 780 N.E.2d 162, 165 (N.Y. 2002) (\"Although the [State] ha[s] the initial\r\nburden of establishing the reasonableness of the police conduct in a pretrial\r\nidentification procedure, the defendant bears the ultimate burden of proving that\r\nthe procedure was unduly suggestive.\"). But see Commonwealth v. Moore, 633\r\nA.2d 1119, 1125 (Pa. 1993) (placing on the State \"the burden of establishing that\r\nany identification testimony to be offered at trial is free from taint of initial\r\nillegality,\" though not clearly on constitutional grounds).\r\n\neyewitness identification is at the trial judge's discretion and will not be disturbed\r\non appeal absent an abuse of discretion\").\r\n\r\nBecause we affirm the court's ruling that the identification procedure was not\r\nimpermissibly suggestive, we need not consider the trial court's determination of\r\nthe second prong of Biggers. See Sanders, 708 F.3d at 984.\r\n\r\n      III.

On appeal, he argues the trial court\r\nerred in trying the charges related to both victims in the same trial. We affirm.\r\n\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nThe two victims are sisters, Dana and Elaina.1 They lived with their grandmother,\r\nalong with their great-grandmother, their older sister, and McGaha. The\r\ngrandmother allowed McGaha, who was not a member of the family, to live in\r\ntheir home.\r\n\r\nDana testified that on multiple occasions, McGaha picked her up at night out of the\r\nbed she shared with her grandmother and took her to his bed in the play room,\r\nwhere he touched her \"private\" with his \"wiener.\" He also put her hand on his\r\n\"wiener,\" and, in her words, \"put his wiener in my mouth and started peeing.\" He\r\nwould then wipe off Dana's mouth with a sock. McGaha told her not to tell\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nElaina also testified that on multiple occasions, McGaha picked her up at night out\r\nof the bed she shared with her great-grandmother and took her to the play room.\r\nWhile there, he would touch her \"pocketbook\"2 with his hands. McGaha also\r\nmade Elaina put her hands on his \"front part\" and hold it. After Elaina was unable\r\nto speak in response to several questions about \"what would happen when he made\r\nyou hold it,\" she testified, \"He touched me with his front part in my mouth\" and\r\n\"made me suck it.\" She said McGaha \"peed\" in her mouth, and she would spit it\r\nout. McGaha told her not to tell anyone.\r\n\r\nOne weekend the children were visiting Jessica, a thirty-year-old relative whom\r\nthey call their aunt. They approached Jessica together, and each one told her what\r\nMcGaha had been doing to them in the play room. Jessica immediately drove\r\nthem home and called the police. Investigator Heather Hubert and several other\r\nofficers responded to the call. Hubert spoke with both children, their sister, their\r\ngrandmother, their great-grandmother, and Jessica. Both children told Hubert what\r\nMcGaha had done to them in the play room. Dana, who was eight, said she had\r\nbeen assaulted since age seven. Elaina, who was seven, said she had been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1These are not the victims' real names. To protect the victims' privacy, we are\r\nusing names that have the same number of syllables and, like their real names,\r\nrhyme with each other.\r\n2The assistant solicitor had Elaina mark on a diagram of the body of a girl Elaina's\r\nage to demonstrate to the jury what she meant by \"pocketbook.\"\r\n\nassaulted since age six. During a search of the home, officer Doug Smith found a\r\npair of girl's underwear between the pillows on McGaha's bed.\r\n\r\nThe State charged McGaha with four crimes in four separate indictments—\r\ncriminal sexual conduct and lewd act as to each victim. The State made a motion\r\nto try the four charges together, and McGaha asked for separate trials as to each\r\nvictim. In a pre-trial hearing, the trial court granted the State's motion.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the State presented testimony from Dana, Elaina, the grandmother, Jessica,\r\nSmith, Hubert, and a pediatrician who physically examined the children for signs\r\nof sexual abuse. The jury also heard testimony from a forensic interviewer who\r\ninterviewed each of them, and the State played video recordings of the interviews\r\nfor the jury. McGaha testified he never touched the victims. He stated he had\r\nHepatitis B and if he had molested them, he would have infected them.\r\n\r\nThe jury found McGaha guilty of all charges. The trial court sentenced him to life\r\nin prison on each criminal sexual conduct conviction and fifteen years,\r\nconsecutive, on each lewd act conviction.3\r\n\r\n      II.    Whether the Trial Court Erred in Trying the Charges Together\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has held that a trial court may try separate charges together\r\n\"where they (1) arise out of a single chain of circumstances, (2) are proved by the\r\nsame evidence, (3) are of the same general nature, and (4) no [substantive] right of\r\nthe defendant has been prejudiced.\" State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 652, 572 S.E.2d\r\n267, 272 (2002); 4 see also State v. Cutro, 365 S.C. 366, 374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894\r\n\r\n3 McGaha was convicted of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first\r\ndegree under South Carolina Code subsection 16-3-655(A)(1) (Supp. 2012), which\r\nrequired he \"must be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum of twenty-five years . .\r\n. or must be imprisoned for life.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-655(D)(1) (Supp. 2012)\r\n(formerly § 16-3-655(C)(1)). At the time of McGaha's crimes, lewd act upon a\r\nchild carried no minimum sentence and a maximum of fifteen years. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-15-140 (2003) (repealed 2012). The crime that was lewd act is now\r\nclassified as criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the third degree. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-3-655(C) (Supp. 2012).\r\n4In other cases, the supreme court has articulated the test differently. See State v.\r\nCutro, 365 S.C. 366, 374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2005) (\"[W]hen offenses charged\r\n\n(2005) (describing the fourth element as \"the defendant's substantive rights are not\r\nprejudiced\"). The trial court has discretion in deciding whether to try charges\r\ntogether, and its decision will be reversed only if there is no evidence to support it\r\nor it is controlled by an error of law. Harris, 351 S.C. at 652, 572 S.E.2d at 272;\r\nState v. Rice, 368 S.C. 610, 613, 629 S.E.2d 393, 394-95 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court applied the test from Harris and made individual\r\nfindings as to each element. Where appropriate, the trial court explained the\r\nfactual basis for the finding. We find the trial court applied the law correctly, and\r\nthere is a factual basis in the record to support each finding. Therefore, the trial\r\ncourt acted within its discretion to try the charges together.\r\n\r\n             A.     Single Chain of Circumstances\r\n\r\nThe trial court properly began its analysis of this element by describing the chain\r\nof circumstances—\"a series of connected transactions that allege and involve\r\nsexual abuse of the victims who had the same relationship to the defendant. . . .\r\n[T]he place where the abuse occurred was the same . . . .\" The evidence supports\r\n\r\nin separate indictments are of the same general nature involving connected\r\ntransactions closely related in kind, place, and character, the trial judge has the\r\ndiscretion to order the indictments tried together, but only so long as the\r\ndefendant's substantive rights are not prejudiced.\" (footnote omitted)); accord State\r\nv. Smith, 322 S.C. 107, 109, 470 S.E.2d 364, 365 (1996). In both Cutro and Smith,\r\nhowever, the supreme court's decision turned only on the fourth element from\r\nHarris—whether the joint trial prejudiced the defendant. It was unnecessary in\r\nthose cases, therefore, for the court to consider the first three elements. In other\r\ncases, our appellate courts have reviewed trial courts' decisions to try charges\r\ntogether using the test as stated in Harris. See, e.g., State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155,\r\n164, 478 S.E.2d 260, 265 (1996); City of Greenville v. Chapman, 210 S.C. 157,\r\n161-62, 41 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1947); State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 278, 468 S.E.2d\r\n76, 79 (Ct. App. 1996); State v. Tate, 286 S.C. 462, 464, 334 S.E.2d 289, 290 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1985). Both versions of the test have a common origin in Chapman.\r\nCompare Cutro, 365 S.C. at 374, 618 S.E.2d at 894 (citing McCrary v. State, 249\r\nS.C. 14, 152 S.E.2d 235 (1967), for the test); Smith, 322 S.C. at 109, 470 S.E.2d at\r\n365 (same); and McCrary, 249 S.C. at 36, 152 S.E.2d at 246 (citing Chapman),\r\nwith Harris, 351 S.C. at 652, 572 S.E.2d at 272 (citing Tucker); Tucker, 324 S.C.\r\nat 164, 478 S.E.2d at 265 (citing Tate); and Tate, 286 S.C. at 464, 334 S.E.2d at\r\n290 (citing Chapman).\r\n\nthe trial court's finding that the charges all arose from the circumstances the court\r\ndescribed. McGaha gained access to the children because the grandmother\r\nallowed him to live in their play room. McGaha used this access on multiple\r\noccasions to take each child from her bed to the play room, where he molested her.\r\nDana was eight and Elaina was seven when the abuse ended. The time periods of\r\nthe abuse overlapped almost precisely—McGaha abused Dana between March\r\n2009 and August 2010 and Elaina between May 2009 and August 2010. Their\r\nsimilar ages and the similar duration of the abuse supports the trial court's\r\nemphasis on its finding that they \"had the same relationship to\" McGaha. The\r\nmolestation of each child during the same time period and in the same location,\r\naccomplished through the same access to them, established a sufficiently\r\nconnected chain of circumstances to satisfy this element.\r\n\r\n             B.    Proven by the Same Evidence\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the charges would be proven \"by the same evidence through\r\nthe same witnesses.\" The record supports the trial court's finding.\r\n\r\nThe jury heard from several witnesses who provided testimony and other evidence\r\nthat proved the charges as to both children. The grandmother testified she had\r\ncustody of them for \"about five years\" at the time of trial, which occurred one year\r\nafter the abuse ended. She testified she had known McGaha \"between five and six\r\nyears\" and explained she allowed him to live in her home because he was a friend\r\nof her daughter and had nowhere else to stay. She also testified McGaha \"was a\r\npretty big help around the house,\" and at first, he got along \"wonderful\" with the\r\nchildren. She explained, \"He took them places. He done things with them.\"\r\n\r\nJessica testified about her relationship with the children and its role in their\r\ndisclosing the sexual abuse to her. She described them as \"very, very sick kids\"\r\nbecause they suffer from a disease that makes them \"very slow mentally.\" She\r\nexplained that every six weeks, she takes them to Augusta, Georgia, to see a\r\nspecialist. Her testimony indicated she is very close to them. She began her\r\ndescription of the weekend they told her what McGaha had been doing to them by\r\ndescribing a conversation she had with them:\r\n\r\n             I . . . went and picked them up on a Friday. I get them\r\n             every chance that I can. And I was giving each of them\r\n             an individual bath, having a woman-to-woman talk with\r\n             them, because I feel like that's part of my responsibility.\r\n\n             And, as I was bathing and caring for them and giving\r\n             them a heart-to-heart talk, I just threw in this statement,\r\n             \"y'all are little girls, and if anybody ever does anything to\r\n             you, whether it be a girl or a boy, you need to tell\r\n             somebody. They may tell you not to say nothing, but you\r\n             need to tell somebody.\"\r\n\r\nJessica then testified, \"The very next morning, the two of them came to me . . . on\r\nmy front porch.\" She then described what they told her about McGaha abusing\r\nthem. She testified she \"immediately\" packed them up, took them home, and\r\ncalled the police. When the police arrived at their house, McGaha was asleep.\r\nJessica testified that when he woke up \"about two hours later, . . . [h]e tried to go\r\nout the back door.\" Jessica heard McGaha say as he was trying to leave, \"Oh,\r\nshoot. The police is here. I've got to get out of here.\"\r\n\r\nOther witnesses also gave testimony that proved the charges related to both\r\nchildren. Officer Smith testified that during his investigation of the house, he\r\nfound a pair of girl's underwear between the pillows of McGaha's bed. The\r\nunderwear was admitted into evidence at trial. Investigator Hubert testified she\r\ninterviewed the children and some of their family members, and after the children\r\ntold her they had been sexually assaulted, she obtained a warrant for McGaha's\r\narrest and arranged for physical examinations and forensic interviews. The\r\npediatrician testified she performed \"head to toe\" physical examinations of both\r\nDana and Elaina and tested them for sexually transmitted diseases, and the test\r\nresults were negative. The pediatrician also testified during the State's rebuttal, in\r\nresponse to McGaha's testimony that he would have given the children Hepatitis B\r\nif he had molested them, that because the children were up-to-date on their\r\nvaccinations they had \"almost no risk at all\" of getting the disease. Finally, to\r\nestablish the foundation for admitting the forensic interviews into evidence, the\r\nforensic interviewer testified about what forensic interviewing is, her training in it,\r\nand the procedures she followed when she interviewed the children.\r\n\r\nThus, a substantial portion of the testimony the State presented at trial to prove the\r\ncrimes against one child was the same evidence it would have used to prove the\r\ncrimes against the other. Even though some of the evidence related to only one\r\nchild, we find the evidence described above supports the trial court's determination\r\nthat the separate charges would be proven by the same evidence. See State v.\r\nCaldwell, 378 S.C. 268, 278, 662 S.E.2d 474, 479-80 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding the\r\nsame-evidence element met because, although the charges involved three separate\r\n\nchildren, which therefore required the State to present some individual evidence as\r\nto each of the charges, \"much of the evidence produced at trial pertained to [all] of\r\nthe separate charges\").\r\n\r\n             C.    Same General Nature\r\n\r\nThe trial court correctly found that charges for criminal sexual conduct with a\r\nminor in the first degree and lewd act upon a child are of the same general nature.\r\nSee State v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 23-24, 564 S.E.2d 331, 333 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n(finding three charges of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and one charge of\r\nlewd act upon a child were of the same general nature because they \"were all\r\nsexual misconduct crimes\"); State v. Deal, 319 S.C. 49, 50-51, 52, 459 S.E.2d 93,\r\n94, 95 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding charges of first-degree criminal sexual assault,\r\nsecond-degree criminal sexual conduct, assault with intent to commit criminal\r\nsexual assault, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, and exposing\r\nanother to HIV were of the same general nature). The issue McGaha raises,\r\nhowever, is not whether charges of criminal sexual conduct and lewd act can be\r\ntried together. Rather, he argues the cases for the two separate victims were not of\r\nthe same general nature. In this respect, the charges in the two cases are not\r\nmerely of the same general nature—they are identical.\r\n\r\n             D.    Prejudice\r\n\r\nMcGaha argues his substantive rights were prejudiced in a joint trial because\r\nevidence of the multiple charges improperly showed his propensity to commit\r\nsimilar crimes. The trial court found no substantive rights would be prejudiced.\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the defendant argues prejudice from the admission of evidence of\r\nthe other charges tried in the same case, our courts have analyzed whether\r\nevidence of one or more charges would be admissible in a trial involving only the\r\nother charge.5 In this case, part of the State's argument for trying the charges\r\n\r\n5 See Cutro, 365 S.C. at 376, 618 S.E.2d at 895 (finding defendant tried for two\r\ncounts of homicide by child abuse and one count of assault and battery was not\r\nprejudiced because the evidence met the motive and common scheme or plan\r\nexceptions in Rule 404(b), SCRE); Smith, 322 S.C. at 110, 470 S.E.2d at 366\r\n(finding defendant charged with homicide by child abuse and assault and battery of\r\na high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) was prejudiced by joint trial because\r\n\ntogether was that in separate trials, evidence of McGaha's molestation of the other\r\nchild would be admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE, as proof of a common\r\nscheme or plan. For the evidence to be admissible in separate trials for the purpose\r\nof showing a common scheme or plan, the State would have to establish a logical\r\nconnection between the crimes by showing a \"close degree of similarity.\" State v.\r\nWallace, 384 S.C. 428, 434, 683 S.E.2d 275, 278 (2009); see also 384 S.C. at 434\r\nn.5, 683 S.E.2d at 278 n.5 (stating the requirement of a connection between the\r\ncrime charged and the evidence of the other crime \"is simply a requirement that the\r\ntwo be factually similar\"). In making such a similarity determination, a court\r\nshould consider \"(1) the age of the victims when the abuse occurred; (2) the\r\nrelationship between the victims and the perpetrator; (3) the location where the\r\nabuse occurred; (4) the use of coercion or threats; [] (5) the manner of the\r\noccurrence, for example, the type of sexual battery,\" and other factors that may be\r\nrelevant in the case. 384 S.C. at 433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278.\r\n\r\nThe record demonstrates that evidence of McGaha's crimes against each victim\r\nwould be admissible in a separate trial as to the other. As we discussed above,\r\nMcGaha used his access to the children, gained by living in their play room, to\r\ncommit each crime. In addition, the children are approximately a year apart in age,\r\nand because they were abused in the same time frame, they were roughly the same\r\nage when the abuse occurred. Each child described similar acts that occurred in\r\nthe same place: McGaha picked them up out of bed, took them into the play room,\r\n\r\nevidence of the ABHAN would not have been admissible in the homicide trial);\r\nDeal, 319 S.C. at 52-53, 459 S.E.2d at 95-96 (finding defendant was not prejudiced\r\nby trying charge of exposing another to HIV together with charges of criminal\r\nsexual conduct and assault and battery because evidence defendant had HIV was\r\nadmissible as to the other charges). Federal courts have analyzed such arguments\r\nthe same way. See, e.g., United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 450, 106 S. Ct. 725,\r\n732, 88 L. Ed. 2d 814, 826 (1986) (finding defendants were not prejudiced by trial\r\nof one charge together with several other charges, in part because evidence of the\r\none charge \"would likely have been admissible\" in a trial of the other charges\r\nunder Rule 404(b), FRE); United States v. Foutz, 540 F.2d 733, 736 (4th Cir. 1976)\r\n(stating \"[o]ne inevitable consequence of a joint trial is that the jury will be aware\r\nof evidence of one crime while considering the defendant's guilt or innocence of\r\nanother\" and \"where evidence of one crime is admissible at a separate trial for\r\nanother, it follows that a defendant will not suffer any additional prejudice if the\r\ntwo offenses are tried together\").\r\n\nmade them touch his penis with their hands, put his penis in their mouths, and\r\nejaculated in their mouths. Dana testified McGaha would wipe off her mouth with\r\na sock, and in her forensic interview, Elaina said McGaha would wipe off her\r\nmouth with the covers of his bed. Finally, they both testified McGaha told them\r\nnot to tell anyone. This evidence establishes that McGaha's abuse of each child\r\nwould likely be admitted into evidence in a separate trial of the other case.\r\n\r\n      III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State's motion for a joint\r\ntrial on all four charges. Therefore, the decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5150","title":"State v.

Murray argues the trial court erred by not charging the\r\njury on the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. We affirm the\r\ntrial court's decision not to charge involuntary manslaughter because there is no\r\nevidence the shooting was unintentional.\r\n\n      I.     Factual and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOn the evening of January 18, 2010, Murray and his girlfriend Faye Brissey drove\r\nto Gibson's residence. According to Faye's testimony, she remained in the car\r\nwhile Murray walked to Gibson's front door and knocked. When Gibson opened\r\nthe door, Murray went inside. \"Not even a second\" after he entered, Faye heard\r\nthree gun shots fired \"back to back.\"1 Murray fled the residence, got back into the\r\ncar with Faye, and sped away. He told Faye a fight occurred inside the residence\r\nand that he killed Gibson.\r\n\r\nThe State introduced a written statement from Faye's cousin, Matt Brissey, who did\r\nnot witness the incident but based the statement on what Murray told him\r\nafterward:   [Murray] knocked on the door and [Gibson] opened the\r\n             door and hit [Murray] in the mouth.2 And [Murray]\r\n             jerked the door open and tried to kick [Gibson]. [Gibson]\r\n             grabbed [Murray]'s foot and pulled him in, and then they\r\n             started wrestling in the living room. And [the] first shot\r\n             hit the wall, and then the second one hit the ceiling, and\r\n             the third one he put the gun . . . to his chest and shot him.\r\n\r\nMatt also testified, and during his testimony stated Murray told him \"there was a\r\nstruggle, that he was trying to shoot [Gibson]. He shot one in his wall, one [in] the\r\ncouch and . . . he rolled [Gibson] on his back when they was wrestling and shot\r\nhim in his chest.\" An investigation by police confirmed there was a bullet hole in\r\nthe living room floor beneath the couch and another in the wall near the ceiling.\r\n\r\nMurray did not testify at trial, but his videotaped interview with two police\r\ndetectives was shown to the jury. In this interview, Murray stated that after Gibson\r\n\r\n1 Gibson's neighbor corroborated Faye's story and testified the gun shots \"were in\r\ncorrect measurement from each other. They were exact. . . . Not like firecrackers .\r\n. . [that] go off at different intervals. They were exactly pop, pop, pop.\"\r\n2Matt testified at trial that Gibson did not strike Murray, but instead the door hit\r\nMurray in the mouth when Gibson opened it.\r\n\nattacked him in the doorway, a fight took place inside the residence. Murray\r\nclaimed the gun was on his waist when he arrived, and he did not \"remember\r\ntaking the gun off [his] waist.\" He stated, \"The only thing I can think of that might\r\nhave happened right now is when I was tussling, it fell out.\" Murray went on to\r\nexplain,     I think the gun fell and that's how I got it in my hand. So\r\n             it probably went off once or twice accidental. And that's\r\n             whenever I pulled it on [Gibson].\r\n\r\nThe video showed one of the detectives prompting Murray to \"show [him] what\r\nhappened.\" Murray then acted out the fight with one of the detectives, who,\r\nfollowing Murray's direction, portrayed the actions of Gibson. The demonstration\r\nshowed Murray and Gibson standing, with Gibson \"leaned over [Murray],\" and\r\nMurray bent under Gibson's body with his head against Gibson's chest. At that\r\npoint in the demonstration, Murray said, \"I think [the gun] dropped on the floor . . .\r\nwhile he was over me.\" Murray demonstrated the gun falling to the floor between\r\nthem, and then explained, \"I went down and got it to keep him from getting to it.\"\r\nMurray gave no indication that Gibson also reached for the gun. As Murray stood\r\nup from the demonstration to speak directly to the detective, he said \"and from\r\nthere it went off probably two times . . . . It just went off, and that's whenever I\r\npulled it up.\" Murray then demonstrated the manner in which he \"pulled [the gun]\r\nup\" to Gibson's chest and explained, \"[Gibson] was still on me.\" When the\r\ndetective told Murray to \"put [the gun] wherever you think it was\" when he shot\r\nGibson, Murray held his hand in the shape of a gun—pointed at the detective's\r\nchest—and said, \"somewhere between his waist and up in here,\" demonstrating\r\nGibson's upper chest.\r\n\r\nMurray asked the court to instruct the jury on self-defense and voluntary\r\nmanslaughter—which the court charged—and also involuntary manslaughter.\r\nMurray argued the shooting was not intentional because the gun fired during a\r\nstruggle over the weapon, and the gunshots were accidental because they were \"all\r\nover the place.\" In denying the request to charge involuntary manslaughter, the\r\ncourt stated, \"I don't remember any testimony -- there was testimony, as I can\r\nremember, about a struggle going on, but I never really heard anything about a\r\nfight over a weapon.\" The jury found Murray guilty of murder, and the court\r\nsentenced him to forty years in prison.\r\n\n      II.    Involuntary Manslaughter\r\n\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is the unintentional killing of another without malice\r\nwhile (1) engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or\r\ngreat bodily harm or (2) engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the\r\nsafety of others. State v. Smith, 391 S.C. 408, 414, 706 S.E.2d 12, 15 (2011). To\r\nwarrant a jury charge on involuntary manslaughter, there must be some evidence\r\nthe killing was unintentional. See Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, 74, 504 S.E.2d\r\n307, 310 (1998) (stating \"involuntary manslaughter is at its core an unintentional\r\nkilling\"); State v. Gibson, 390 S.C. 347, 357, 701 S.E.2d 766, 771 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(stating \"the essence of involuntary manslaughter is the involuntary nature of the\r\nkilling\"). In this case, the evidence conclusively demonstrates Murray killed\r\nGibson intentionally.\r\n\r\nIn his interview, Murray claimed the gun \"probably went off once or twice\r\naccidental.\" On appeal, he argues this is supported by the random location of the\r\nbullet holes—one in the floor beneath the couch and another in the wall near the\r\nceiling. Even if the first two shots were unintentional, however, there is no\r\nevidence Murray did not intend to fire the third shot. In fact, Murray stated in his\r\ninterview that after he grabbed the gun and the first two shots discharged, he\r\n\"pulled [the gun] on [Gibson]\" and fired the third shot, which hit Gibson\r\n\"[a]nywhere from his waist up to about his solarplex.\" Murray's statements to Matt\r\nalso demonstrate Murray intentionally fired the third shot: \"[The] first shot hit the\r\nwall, and then the second one hit the ceiling, and the third one [I] put the gun . . . to\r\nhis chest and shot him.\" Thus, even if a jury could reasonably conclude Murray\r\naccidentally fired the first two shots, there is no evidence the third shot, resulting\r\nfrom Murray \"put[ting] the gun . . . to [Gibson's] chest\" and shooting, was\r\nunintentional. Because there is no evidence the killing was unintentional, the trial\r\ncourt correctly refused to charge involuntary manslaughter. See State v. Tucker,\r\n324 S.C. 155, 171, 478 S.E.2d 260, 268 (1996) (holding involuntary manslaughter\r\ncharge improper because \"[e]ven if the first shooting was unintentional, the same\r\ncannot be said of the second\"); State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 7, 292 S.E.2d 581,\r\n585 (1982) (holding involuntary manslaughter charge not warranted \"when at least\r\none of the two shots was fired deliberately\"), overruled on other grounds by State\r\nv. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\n\r\nMurray argues, however, there is evidence Gibson was accidentally shot during a\r\nstruggle for control of the gun. Murray cites State v. Light, 378 S.C. 641, 664\r\nS.E.2d 465 (2008), and Tisdale v. State, 378 S.C. 122, 662 S.E.2d 410 (2008) for\r\n\nthe proposition that \"evidence of a struggle between the defendant and the victim\r\nover a weapon supports submission of an involuntary manslaughter charge.\" 378\r\nS.C. at 125, 662 S.E.2d at 412. Like this case, however, Light and Tisdale turn on\r\nthe existence or non-existence of evidence of an unintentional killing. In those\r\ncases, and in other cases like them, our courts held a struggle over a gun warrants a\r\ncharge on involuntary manslaughter because, on the facts before them, the finding\r\nthat such a struggle occurred is evidence the shooting was unintentional. See\r\nLight, 378 S.C. at 646, 648-49, 664 S.E.2d at 467, 468-69 (holding involuntary\r\nmanslaughter charge appropriate where defendant attempted to take gun from\r\nvictim, and gun \"went off\" immediately after defendant \"jerked it away from [the\r\nvictim]\"); Tisdale, 378 S.C. at 124, 126, 662 S.E.2d at 412 (holding involuntary\r\nmanslaughter charge warranted where defendant and victim fought for gun, and it\r\n\"went off\" while still in victim's hands). For example, in State v. Brayboy, 387\r\nS.C. 174, 182, 691 S.E.2d 482, 486 (Ct. App. 2010), the victim pulled a gun on the\r\ndefendant. In response, the defendant pushed the victim, causing the gun to fall to\r\nthe ground. Id. Both men reached for the gun, but the defendant grabbed it first\r\nand picked it up. Id. When he did, the gun fired, killing the victim. Id. The\r\ndefendant claimed he did not \"even remember the gun\" at the time it discharged.\r\nId. This court held the defendant was entitled to a charge of involuntary\r\nmanslaughter because on those facts the struggle for control of the gun was\r\nevidence that the defendant did not intentionally pull the trigger. Id.\r\n\r\nIn this case, however, there is no evidence the struggle was for control of the gun.\r\nMurray's gun was in his waistband when he arrived, but there is no evidence\r\nGibson knew Murray had it. Although Murray stated he \"got [the gun] to keep\r\n[Gibson] from getting to it,\" there is no evidence Gibson knew the gun had fallen,\r\nmuch less that Gibson also tried to grab it. This case is distinguishable\r\nfrom Light, Tisdale, and Brayboy, therefore, because the facts provide no basis\r\nupon which a jury could find the third shot was unintentionally fired during a\r\nstruggle over the gun. In addition, Murray admitted he \"pulled [the gun] on\r\n[Gibson]\" and fired the third shot intentionally.3 On these facts, we hold the trial\r\ncourt correctly refused to charge involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n3See also Douglas, 332 S.C. at 74, 504 S.E.2d at 310-11 (finding no involuntary\r\nmanslaughter charge warranted where defendant admitted he intentionally fired a\r\ngun into a crowd); State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 531-32, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366-67\r\n(1996) (holding defendant not entitled to charge on involuntary manslaughter\r\nbecause defendant admitted intentionally shooting the gun recklessly in self-\r\ndefense); Gibson, 390 S.C. at 358, 701 S.E.2d at 772 (holding trial court properly\r\n\n      III.

Daisy Wallace\r\nSimpson (Wife) argues the family court committed error by modifying the division\r\nof property in the decree and failing to award her attorney's fees and expenses.\r\nWilliam R. Simpson, Sr. (Husband) and William R.

Husband and Son also contend that Wife is judicially estopped\r\nfrom demanding a cash sum award or that the LLC transfer real estate to her. We\r\nreverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife married in 1968. During the course of the marriage, Husband\r\nbecame a successful farmer and real estate investor. In April 2000, Husband and\r\nSon signed a limited liability company operating agreement and Husband began to\r\ntransfer substantial property acquired during the marriage into Simpson Farms,\r\nL.L.C. (the LLC). One month later, Wife became aware of these transfers of\r\nproperty into the LLC.\r\n\r\nIn March 2003, Wife filed an action for divorce, naming Husband, Son, and the\r\nLLC as parties. In her complaint, Wife requested, among other relief, an equitable\r\ndivision of the marital assets, including the property that Husband transferred into\r\nthe LLC. Most of the trial concerned the identity and value of Husband's vast\r\nproperty holdings.\r\n\r\nOn December 31, 2004, Husband and Wife were divorced by decree of the family\r\ncourt (the Final Decree). In the Final Decree, the family court found that each of\r\nHusband's individually owned property holdings was marital property. The family\r\ncourt further found \"the transfer of marital property into the LLC was effective as\r\nto Son, and Husband should be charged with only 50% of the value of the property\r\nheld by the LLC.\" Additionally, the family court identified and valued the marital\r\nproperty that Husband owned individually and as a member of the LLC.\r\n\r\nBased on its identification of the marital assets, the family court awarded Wife\r\n34% of the marital estate, valued at $784,055. In order to effect the equitable\r\ndivision, the family court ordered Husband to transfer to Wife each of the seven\r\n\nproperties it found Husband owned individually.1 By a subsequent order, the\r\nfamily court awarded Wife $85,000 in attorney's fees and costs. Husband appealed\r\nthe equitable division of the marital property in the Final Decree. Wife appealed\r\nthe order regarding attorney's fees and costs. Neither Son nor the LLC appealed.\r\n\r\nThis matter initially came before this court in Simpson v. Simpson, Unpublished\r\nOpinion No. 2007-UP-147 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 4, 2007), cert. denied, Feb.\r\n21, 2008 (Simpson I). Therein, Husband argued the family court erred in awarding\r\nto Wife certain pieces of real property that were owned by the LLC. Simpson I.\r\nThis court found that Husband's argument was not preserved for appellate review. 2\r\nId. Additionally, this court stated that, even if the issue had been preserved,\r\nHusband failed to present credible evidence to support his contention that the\r\nproperty had been transferred to the LLC. Id. Accordingly, this court held, \"the\r\nproperty awarded to [Wife] was individually owned by [Husband], and was not\r\nproperty owned by the LLC.\" Id. (emphasis added). As to Wife's appeal, this\r\ncourt remanded the issues of attorney's fees and costs to the family court. Id.\r\nHusband subsequently filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with our supreme\r\ncourt, which was denied on February 21, 2008.\r\n\r\nFollowing Simpson I, Wife filed a contempt action, alleging Husband and Son\r\nwere in contempt for failing to transfer the funds and properties awarded to her in\r\nthe Final Decree.3 Thereafter, several contempt hearings were held before another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Final Decree did not order Son or the LLC to take part in the transfer of\r\nproperty to Wife.\r\n2 In Simpson I, this court held that the issue was not preserved because Husband\r\ndid not raise it to the family court and the family court dismissed his subsequent\r\nRule 59(e) motion. This court also noted that Husband failed to raise the issue in\r\nhis Rule 59(e) motion.\r\n3 Prior to the hearing on Wife's motion, Van Mark Stone and Paul Terry Stone\r\n(collectively, the Stones) filed a lis pendens on the House and 16 acres. The\r\nStones subsequently brought a declaratory judgment action against the LLC,\r\nHusband, Son, and Wife. The Stones' action sought to quiet title to a 3.5 acre\r\nportion of the House and 16 acres, including the house and three acres surrounding\r\nthe house. The parties eventually settled the quiet title action with the Stones. As\r\na part of the settlement, Wife signed a consent order, acknowledging that Husband\r\ndid not own the house and surrounding three acres.\r\n\nfamily court judge. 4 Throughout the hearings, Husband and Son maintained that\r\nHusband did not have the legal ability to transfer complete interest in three of the\r\nseven properties awarded to Wife in the decree—the 161.1 acre tract, the 133.2\r\nacre tract, and the House and 16 acres (collectively, the subject properties)—\r\nbecause the properties were titled in the name of the LLC.5 Additionally, Son\r\ntestified that as a member of the LLC he would not consent to transferring the\r\nsubject properties to Wife.\r\n\r\nAfter the contempt hearings, the family court issued a contempt order on May 28,\r\n2010, finding Husband was not in contempt because the LLC was the titled owner\r\nof the subject properties. Consequently, the family court denied Wife's request for\r\nattorney's fees regarding the contempt action. On June 7, 2010, Wife filed a\r\nmotion to reconsider, arguing the family court erred in finding Husband was not\r\nthe titled owner of the subject properties. Wife further argued the contempt order\r\nwould result in her receiving less than her percentage share of the marital assets.\r\nIn response to Wife's motion, the family court issued an order on March 18, 2011,\r\nreapportioning the marital property. Subsequently, Husband and Son individually\r\nfiled motions for reconsideration with the family court, which were both denied.\r\nThis cross-appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 At the second contempt hearing, Husband informed the family court that he had\r\ntendered quitclaim deeds to Wife conveying his individual interest for each of the\r\nseven properties. He also stated that Wife had rejected the quitclaim deeds and\r\ninsisted that Husband provide her with general warranty deeds to the properties.\r\nWife later testified that she rejected all of the quitclaim deeds, except one, because\r\nthey gave her less than her percentage share of the marital assets. She explained\r\nthat she accepted the quitclaim for the 6.7 acre tract, in order to satisfy the parties'\r\ndaughter, Charley Simpson (Daughter). She testified that she had accepted the\r\nquitclaim deed because the family court had inadvertently included the 6.7 acre\r\ntract as one of the properties awarded to her in the Final Decree. Wife's testimony\r\nis consistent with the Final Decree, which recognized that Husband and Wife had\r\nagreed that Daughter was to receive a house, not clearly identified in the evidence,\r\nas a gift on her twenty-first birthday.\r\n5 Husband and Son did not challenge the family court's finding that the other four\r\nproperties awarded to Wife in the Final Decree were actually titled in Husband's\r\nindividual name.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, appellate courts review factual and legal issues de\r\nnovo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); Lewis\r\nv. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651-52 (2011). \"However, we\r\nrecognize this broad scope of review does not alter the fact that a family court is\r\nbetter able to make credibility determinations because it has the opportunity to\r\nobserve the witnesses.\" Wilburn v. Wilburn, Op. No. 27222 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed\r\nMay 8, 2013) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 20 at 22). \"Additionally, the de novo\r\nstandard does not relieve the appellant of the burden of identifying error in the\r\nfamily court's findings.\" Id. \"Accordingly, the decision of the family court will be\r\nupheld unless the Court finds that a preponderance of the evidence weighs against\r\nthe family court's decision.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.   Modification of the Decree\r\n\r\nWife, Husband, and Son argue the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\r\nto modify the division of property set forth in the Final Decree. We agree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the family court has the authority to modify any order issued by the\r\ncourt. S.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-530(A)(25)(2010) (stating the family court has\r\nexclusive jurisdiction to modify or vacate any order issued by the court).\r\nHowever, \"the law in South Carolina is exceedingly clear that the family court\r\ndoes not have the authority to modify court ordered property divisions.\" Green v.\r\nGreen, 327 S.C. 577, 581, 491 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 1997) (emphasis added)\r\n(citations omitted); see Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 375\r\n(4th ed. 2010) (discussing exceptions to the family court's exclusive jurisdiction to\r\nmodify an order issued by it). Section 20-3-620(C) of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2012) provides, \"The [family] court's order as it affects distribution of\r\nmarital property shall be a final order not subject to modification except by appeal\r\nor remand following proper appeal.\" As this court explained in Swentor v.\r\nSwentor, 336 S.C. 472, 480 n.2, 520 S.E.2d 330, 334 n.2 (Ct. App. 1999):\r\n\r\n             While an agreement concerning alimony or child support\r\n             may be modified and enforced by the family court unless\r\n             the agreement clearly provides otherwise, an agreement\r\n             regarding equitable apportionment claims is final and\r\n\n             may not be modified by the parties or the court, although\r\n             it may be enforced by the family court unless the\r\n             agreement provides otherwise.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing Simpson I, Husband and Son used the contempt hearings as an\r\nopportunity to relitigate the issue of ownership of the subject properties.\r\nThroughout the contempt hearings, Husband and Son maintained that they should\r\nnot be held in contempt because the subject properties were titled in the name of\r\nthe LLC, rather than in Husband's individual name. The family court judge\r\nultimately accepted Husband and Son's contention and issued a contempt order on\r\nMay 28, 2010, finding the subject properties were titled in the name of the LLC.\r\nBased on this finding, the family court concluded that Husband, as a member of\r\nthe LLC, did not have a transferrable interest in the real estate belonging to the\r\nLLC pursuant to South Carolina Code section 33-44-501(a).6 As a result, the\r\nfamily court determined that it could not specifically enforce the provision in the\r\nFinal Decree ordering Husband, individually, to transfer full ownership in the\r\nsubject properties to Wife. In an effort to resolve this issue, the family court issued\r\nan order on March 18, 2011, removing Son's fifty-percent interest in each of the\r\nsubject properties from the marital estate and reapportioning the marital property.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, both the May 28, 2010 contempt order and the March 18, 2011\r\norder on Wife's motion for reconsideration, in effect, modified the division of\r\nproperty in the Final Decree. Notably, in taking this course of action, the family\r\ncourt acknowledged that its rulings were in contravention of the property\r\nprovisions in the Final Decree which this court upheld in Simpson I and upon\r\nwhich our supreme court denied certiorari. Nonetheless, the family court found its\r\nequitable powers provided it the authority to reinterpret the decree and to\r\nreapportion the marital property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Generally, \"a limited liability company is a legal entity distinct from its\r\nmembers.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-201 (2006 & Supp. 2012). \"A member is not\r\na co-owner of, and has no transferable interest in, property of a limited liability\r\ncompany.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-501(a) (2006 & Supp. 2012); see also\r\nComment to S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-501 (\"Members have no property interest in\r\nproperty owned by a limited liability company.\").\r\n\nWe find the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the property\r\nprovisions in the Final Decree. This court has previously held that it is beyond the\r\nequitable powers of the family court to reopen and modify court ordered property\r\ndivisions. See Green, 327 S.C. at 581, 491 S.E.2d at 262 (holding the family court\r\nerred by concluding it was within its equitable powers to reopen and modify\r\nportions of a property settlement agreement incorporated into a divorce decree).\r\nFurthermore, Simpson I affirmed the identification and apportionment of the\r\nmarital property in the Final Decree. The sole issue remanded to the family court\r\nwas the issue of attorney's fees. See S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-620(C) (\"The [family]\r\ncourt's order as it affects distribution of marital property shall be a final order not\r\nsubject to modification except by appeal or remand following proper appeal.\");\r\nHayes v. Hayes, 312 S.C. 141, 144, 439 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding\r\nthe family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider wife's subsequent\r\naction for equitable distribution of husband's retirement benefits). Accordingly, in\r\nthe present case, it was error for the family court to modify the property provisions\r\nin the Final Decree.7\r\n\r\nWe also find the family court erred in allowing Husband and Son to relitigate the\r\nissue of ownership of the subject properties at the contempt hearings. First,\r\nHusband and Son's argument that Husband, individually, could not comply with\r\nthe Final Decree because the subject properties were titled in the name of the LLC,\r\nwas barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See Duckett v. Goforth, 374 S.C. 446,\r\n464, 649 S.E.2d 72, 81 (Ct. App. 2007) (\"Res judicata precludes parties from\r\nsubsequently relitigating issues actually litigated and those that might have been\r\nlitigated in a prior action\"); Richardson v. Richardson, 309 S.C. 31, 35, 419 S.E.2d\r\n806, 808 (Ct. App. 1992) (upholding the family court's ruling that the \"issue of\r\nalimony was res judicata and could not be relitigated and it was the court's duty to\r\neffect compliance with the agreement as best as possible\" when husband contended\r\nhe could not comply with the parties' settlement agreement requiring him to satisfy\r\nhis alimony obligation by transferring the marital home to wife because the home\r\nwas owned by his mother). Second, the law of the case doctrine precluded\r\nHusband and Son from relitigating this issue. In Simpson I, this court explicitly\r\n\r\n7 Because it was error for the family court to modify the property provisions in the\r\nFinal Decree, we need not address Husband's and Son's additional arguments\r\nregarding the modification of the Final Decree and the reapportionment of the\r\nmarital estate. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing an appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nfound \"the property awarded to [Wife] was individually owned by [Husband], and\r\nwas not property owned by the LLC.\" (emphasis added). Thus, Simpson I\r\nexpressly rejected Husband's argument concerning the LLC's ownership of the\r\nsubject properties. Moreover, our supreme court implicitly approved the\r\nownership determinations in the Final Decree by denying Husband's petition for\r\ncertiorari. See Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455, 458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009)\r\n(citing Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 632, 576 S.E.2d 156, 166 (2003)) (stating\r\nthat under the law of the case doctrine, \"a party is precluded from relitigating, after\r\nan appeal, matters that were either not raised on appeal, but should have been, or\r\nraised on appeal, but expressly rejected by the appellate court\"). Furthermore, Son,\r\nwho has been a party to this action since it commenced in 2003, did not appeal the\r\nfamily court's determination that Husband individually owned the subject\r\nproperties. See Doran v. Doran, 288 S.C. 477, 478, 343 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1986)\r\n(stating that no objection can be made to an appealable order from which no appeal\r\nwas taken); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 160-61, 177 S.E.2d\r\n544, 544 (1970) (stating an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the\r\ncase and requires affirmance). Therefore, Husband and Son were not entitled to\r\ntake a second bite at the apple by defending themselves in the contempt\r\nproceedings on the ground that the subject properties were titled in the name of the\r\nLLC.\r\n\r\nII.    Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\r\n\r\nHusband and Son argue the family court erred by not setting forth specific findings\r\nof fact or conclusions of law it reached in its March 18, 2011 order, reversing its\r\nMay 28, 2010 contempt order. Having found the modifications to the decree made\r\nin both orders were error, we need not address Husband and Son's argument. See\r\nFutch, 335 S.C. at 613, 518 S.E.2d at 598 (providing an appellate court need not\r\naddress remaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nIII.    Judicial Estoppel\r\n\r\nHusband and Son contend that because Wife had previously maintained in all\r\njudicial forums that the subject properties belonged to Husband, she is precluded\r\nby judicial estoppel from demanding a cash sum award or that the LLC transfer\r\nreal estate to her. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Judicial estoppel is an equitable concept that prevents a litigant from asserting a\r\nposition inconsistent with, or in conflict with, one the litigant has previously\r\n\nasserted in the same or related proceeding.\" Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215,\r\n592 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2004). In Cothran, our supreme court held that the following\r\nelements are necessary for the doctrine of judicial estoppel to apply: (1) two\r\ninconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one\r\nanother; (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings\r\ninvolving the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking\r\nthe position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have\r\nreceived some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to\r\nmislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent. 357 S.C.\r\nat 215-16, 592 S.E.2d at 632.\r\n\r\nWe find the evidence in this matter fails to satisfy the fourth element of judicial\r\nestoppel. The fourth necessary element of judicial estoppel is satisfied when a\r\nlitigant asserts an inconsistent position as a part of an intentional effort to mislead\r\nthe court. Id. at 216, 592 S.E2d at 632. Here, there is no evidence Wife sought to\r\nintentionally mislead the family court. To the contrary, in Simpson I, this court\r\nfound that Wife's expert \"had a difficult time determining what property had been\r\nacquired and sold by Husband due to the lack of income or expense records\r\nmaintained by Husband or [Son].\" Additionally, this court found that Husband\r\neffectively stonewalled Wife's expert's efforts to identify Husband's property\r\nholdings because \"he failed to provide a list of his property.\" Simpson I. This\r\ncourt noted that Wife's expert \"had to look in several counties to determine what\r\nHusband owned\" and \"spent 1,248 hours attempting to identify all of the property\r\nowned by Husband.\" Id. Moreover, within the Final Decree, the family court\r\nstressed its own difficulty in determining what property Husband owned. Given\r\nthe difficult circumstances Wife faced in determining the exact nature of Husband's\r\nproperty holdings, we find judicial estoppel does not apply because there was no\r\nintentional effort by Wife to mislead the court.\r\n\r\nIV.    Enforcement of the Decree\r\n\r\nThe crux of this dispute is how Wife's equitable apportionment award should be\r\nenforced. Due to the prolonged nature of this dispute and the family court's\r\nadmitted difficulty in enforcing the Final Decree, we address the appropriate\r\nmethod of making Wife whole again.\r\n\r\nAlthough the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the property\r\nprovisions in the Final Decree, it did have the equitable authority to enforce the\r\nFinal Decree. See Swentor, 336 S.C. at 480 n.2, 520 S.E.2d at 334 n.2 (stating that\r\n\nalthough an order regarding the distribution of marital property is not modifiable, it\r\nmay be enforced by the family court). Therefore, even if the Final Decree\r\nmistakenly declared the subject properties to be titled in Husband's name, it was\r\nthe duty of the family court to interpret the intent of the property provisions in the\r\nFinal Decree and effect compliance as best as possible. See Richardson, 309 S.C.\r\nat 36, 419 S.E.2d at 809 (citing Means v. Means, 277 S.C. 428, 288 S.E.2d 811\r\n(1982)) (stating the duty of the trial judge in an action for civil contempt is to\r\ndetermine an appropriate method of making the aggrieved party whole again when\r\nthe prior order cannot be specifically enforced as written).\r\n\r\n\"The primary purpose of an action for civil contempt is to exact compliance\" and\r\nin doing such, \"the court must interpret what the decree mandated, considering the\r\npurpose and object of the underlying litigation.\" Id. at 35-36, 419 S.E.2d at 809. In\r\nthis instance, the Final Decree clearly identifies the subject properties as marital\r\nproperty titled in Husband's individual name. Additionally, the Final Decree orders\r\nHusband to transfer to Wife full ownership in each of the subject properties as a\r\npart of her equitable apportionment award. Therefore, we interpret the decree as\r\nmandating that Wife receive full ownership in the subject properties.\r\n\r\nGiven the clear mandate in the Final Decree that Wife is entitled to full ownership\r\nin the subject properties, it was the duty of the family court to effectuate the\r\ndivision of marital property as written in the Final Decree. Furthermore, in\r\nSimpson I, this court found that there was no credible evidence to support Husband\r\nand Son's argument that the family court mistakenly declared the subject properties\r\nto be titled in Husband's name. Therefore, irrespective of the alleged mistake in\r\nthe Final Decree, the family court had subject matter jurisdiction to determine the\r\nsubject properties were marital property and to apportion the subject properties to\r\nWife.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has held that the family court has subject matter jurisdiction to\r\nequitably apportion property owned by a third party. In re Sexton, 298 S.C. 359,\r\n361, 380 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1989); see generally Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation\r\nin South Carolina 276 (4th ed. 2010) (discussing the family court's authority to\r\nequitably apportion property owned by a third party). Section 20-3-630(A) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) defines marital property as \"all real and\r\npersonal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and\r\nwhich is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . .\r\nregardless of how legal title is held.\" (emphasis added). \"This section specifically\r\nprovides for the possibility that marital property could be titled in a third party.\" In\r\n\nre Sexton, 298 S.C. at 361, 380 S.E.2d at 834. When property is alleged to be\r\nmarital property, but is owned by a third party, the family court has the authority to\r\njoin all persons with a possible interest in the property as parties to the action and\r\nto determine if the property constitutes marital property. Id. at 361-62, 380 S.E.2d\r\nat 834. \"If the property is found to be marital property, the [family court] has the\r\nauthority to apportion it among the parties.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThis court previously dealt with the issue of distributing marital property owned by\r\na third party in Richardson v. Richardson, 309 S.C. 31, 419 S.E.2d 806 (Ct. App.\r\n1992). There, the family court adopted the parties' settlement agreement, which\r\nrequired husband and husband's mother to transfer the marital home to wife as a\r\npart of wife's alimony award. Id. at 33, 419 S.E.2d at 807. Wife brought a rule to\r\nshow cause motion against husband and husband's mother, alleging they had not\r\ncomplied with the alimony provisions of the divorce decree. Id. at 34, 419 S.E.2d\r\nat 808. In his return, husband argued that he did not own an interest in the marital\r\nhome and was legally unable to comply with the decree. Id. The family court\r\nfound that it had no jurisdiction over husband's mother because she was not a party\r\nto the divorce proceedings. Id. The family court concluded that husband was not\r\nin contempt because he was not the titled owner of the property and was unable to\r\ncomply with the divorce decree. Id. at 35, 419 S.E.2d at 808. In order to make\r\nwife whole, the family court determined the value of the marital residence and\r\nordered husband to pay to wife lump sum alimony in that amount. Id. This court\r\nupheld the decision of the family court, finding \"the family court's interpretation to\r\nbe logical and fair and the best possible solution in making the wife whole.\" Id. at\r\n36, 419 S.E.2d at 808.\r\n\r\nWe find that the facts of the present case are distinguishable from Richardson. In\r\nthis instance, Husband, Son, and the LLC were all joined as parties to the divorce\r\naction. In the Final Decree, the family court concluded that fifty-percent of\r\nproperty titled in the name of the LLC property was marital property. The family\r\ncourt also found that all the property titled in Husband's individual name was\r\nmarital property. As to the subject properties, the family court classified each one\r\nas marital property titled in Husband's individual name. Neither Husband, Son, or\r\nthe LLC properly challenged this classification. See Simpson I. Moreover, this\r\ncourt affirmed the family's court determination that the subject properties were\r\nmarital property titled in Husband's individual name. Id. Because the LLC was\r\njoined as a party to the divorce action and the family court determined the subject\r\nproperties were marital property, the family court had the authority to award full\r\nownership in the subject properties to Wife, regardless of how legal title was held.\r\n\nSee In re Sexton, 298 S.C. at 361-62, 380 S.E.2d at 834 (stating that if the family\r\ncourt determines that property owned by a third party is marital property, and the\r\nthird party has been joined in the action, then the family court has the authority to\r\ndetermine the parties' equitable rights therein); Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C. 344,\r\n351, 440 S.E.2d 387, 391 (Ct. App. 1994) (rejecting husband's mother's argument\r\nthat marital home titled in her name was not marital property and affirming the\r\naward of the marital home to husband).\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Final Decree, Wife was entitled to have full ownership in the\r\nsubject properties. As outlined above, the family court had subject matter\r\njurisdiction to award full ownership interest in the subject properties to Wife.\r\nFurthermore, the family court reiterated throughout the Final Decree that there was\r\nno clear identification and valuation of the marital property due, in large part, to\r\nHusband and Son's resistance to any effort to disclose the exact nature of their\r\nholdings. Therefore, it would be inappropriate and inequitable to allow Husband\r\nand Son to benefit, by avoiding transfer of the subject properties to Wife, from an\r\nerror created by their own conduct. See Cox v. Cox, 290 S.C. 245, 248, 349 S.E.2d\r\n92, 93 (Ct. App. 1986) (\"A party cannot complain of an error which his own\r\nconduct has induced.\").\r\n\r\nWe find equity and fairness require the family court to carry the terms of the Final\r\nDecree into effect by requiring Husband, Son, and the LLC to join in the execution\r\nof the deeds to the subject properties to Wife. See Ex parte Dibble, 279 S.C. 592,\r\n595, 310 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct. App. 1983) (stating that \"[c]ourts have the inherent\r\npower to do all things reasonably necessary to insure that just results are reached to\r\nthe fullest extent possible\"); cf. Buckley v. Shealy, 370 S.C. 317, 323-24, 635\r\nS.E.2d 76, 79 (2006) (stating the family court was authorized to convert to money\r\njudgment a note that the husband had been ordered, but failed, to assign to wife in\r\ndivorce proceedings). Therefore, we reverse the family court's orders modifying\r\nthe ownership determinations and division of property in the decree and remand\r\nthis case to the family court to enforce the property provisions in the Final Decree\r\nby ordering Husband, Son, and the LLC to join in the execution of the deeds to the\r\nsubject properties to Wife.\r\n\r\nV.   Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nWife argues that the family court abused its discretion by failing to award her\r\ncompensatory attorney's fees and expenses for her efforts to enforce the terms of\r\nthe Final Decree. We agree.\r\n\nIt is well settled that an award of attorney's fees is within the sound discretion of\r\nthe trial judge and will only be disturbed on appeal upon a showing of an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. Abate v. Abate, 377 S.C. 548, 555, 660 S.E.2d 515, 519 (Ct. App.\r\n2008). Courts may award attorney's fees under a compensatory contempt theory.\r\nId. at 555 n.4, 660 S.E.2d at 519 n.4. The court may award compensatory\r\ncontempt damages to the moving party for the costs he or she incurs in forcing the\r\nnon-complying party to obey the court's orders. See Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C.\r\n106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1998) (\"In a civil contempt proceeding, a contemnor\r\nmay be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred in enforcing\r\nthe court's prior order, including reasonable attorney's fees. The award of\r\nattorney's fees is not a punishment but an indemnification to the party who\r\ninstituted the contempt proceeding.\"); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 345, 491\r\nS.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"A compensatory contempt award may include\r\nattorney fees.\").\r\n\r\nWife has spent over five years seeking to enforce the property provisions in the\r\nFinal Decree. The family court held that Husband was not in contempt because the\r\nsubject properties were titled in the name of the LLC and, therefore, Husband did\r\nnot have the legal ability to comply with the terms of the decree. As discussed\r\npreviously, the finding that the LLC was the titled owner of the subject properties\r\nwas erroneous. See Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 546, 670 S.E.2d 669, 673\r\n(Ct. App. 2008) (\"An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by\r\nan error of law or is based on factual findings that are without evidentiary\r\nsupport.\"). Therefore, we remand the issue of attorney's fees for further\r\nconsideration in light of this decision.\r\n\r\nVI.   Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe reverse the family court's modifications to the property provisions of the Final\r\nDecree and remand for enforcement of the Final Decree as instructed in this\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
