Petrano, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Dexter Antonio Williams (Williams) appeals the Post-Conviction\r\n  Relief (PCR) judgeâ€™s finding that Williamsâ€™ trial counsel was not ineffective\r\n  for failing to move to exempt Williams from sexual offender status and for not\r\n  advising Williams he would be required to register as a sexual offender unless\r\n  the trial court ordered otherwise.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliams pled guilty to kidnapping, two counts of armed robbery,\r\n  possession of a stolen motor vehicle, failure to stop for a blue light, and\r\n  possession of a gun by a person under the age of twenty-one.Â  Pursuant to section 23-3-430(C)(15) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2007), a defendant over the age of eighteen who pleads guilty to\r\n  kidnapping will be classified as a sexual offender unless the trial court makes\r\n  a finding on the record that the kidnapping did not include a criminal sexual\r\n  offense.Â  Williamsâ€™ trial counsel did not ask the trial court to make a\r\n  determination as to the nature of the kidnapping.Â Â Â  \r\nSubsequent to Williamsâ€™ guilty plea, Williams filed a PCR\r\n  application claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Â A PCR hearing was held,\r\n  and Williams argued his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ask the\r\n  trial court to make a finding of fact on the record that Williamsâ€™\r\n  participation in the kidnapping was not sexual in nature, which would relieve\r\n  Williams of having to register as a sexual offender upon his release from\r\n  prison.Â  The PCR judge held registration on the sexual offender registry\r\n  was a collateral consequence of Williamsâ€™ sentence, and Williamsâ€™ application\r\n  was dismissed.Â  Williams then filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which this\r\n  Court granted.[1] Â This appeal follows.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThis Court will sustain the PCR judgeâ€™s factual\r\n  findings and conclusions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel if there\r\n  is any probative evidence to support those findings.â€Â  Hutto v. State,\r\n  376 S.C. 77, 80, 654 S.E.2d 846, 847 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWilliams argues his\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective: (1) for failing to move to exempt Williams from\r\n  sexual offender status because the kidnapping charge against him was not sexual\r\n  in nature; and (2) for failing to advise Williams he would be required to\r\n  register as a sexual offender unless the trial court ordered otherwise.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nTo establish a\r\n  claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove trial\r\n  counselâ€™s performance was deficient, and due to this deficient representation,\r\n  the applicant was prejudiced.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).Â  This same standard applies to a guilty plea.Â  Alexander v. State,\r\n  303 S.C. 539, 542, 402 S.E.2d 484, 485 (1991).Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  imposition of a sentence may have a number of collateral consequences, however,\r\n  and a plea of guilty is not rendered involuntary in a constitutional sense if\r\n  the defendant is not informed of the collateral consequences.â€Â  Brown\r\n    v. State, 306 S.C. 381, 382-83, 412 S.E.2d 399, 400 (1991) (emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  Thus, a defendant need not be advised of all collateral\r\n  consequences of his or her plea in order for the plea to withstand\r\n  constitutional scrutiny.Â  Id.; see also Cuthrell v. Dir.,\r\n    Patuxent Inst., 475 F.2d 1364, 1365-66 (4th Cir. 1973) (â€œ[B]efore pleading,\r\n  the defendant need not be advised of all collateral consequences of his plea .\r\n  . . .â€).Â  â€œ[A]side from two non-collateral matters specifically listed in the\r\n  PCR Act, PCR is a proper avenue of relief only when the applicant mounts a\r\n    collateral attack challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence .\r\n  . . .â€Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 367, 527 S.E.2d 742, 749\r\n  (2000) (emphasis in original).Â Â Â  \r\nThe pivotal\r\n  question of whether Williamsâ€™ counsel was ineffective for failing to ask the\r\n  trial court to make a finding on the record that Williamsâ€™ kidnapping charge\r\n  was not sexual in nature, therefore, depends on whether registration on the\r\n  sexual offender registry is a collateral consequence of sentencing.Â  If\r\n  registration is a collateral consequence of sentencing, Williamsâ€™ trial counsel\r\n  cannot be viewed as ineffective for failing to advise Williams of the registration\r\n  requirement, and by implication, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for\r\n  failing to move to exempt Williams from sexual offender status.Â Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  distinction between â€˜directâ€™ and â€˜collateralâ€™ consequences of a plea, while\r\n  sometimes shaded in the relevant decisions, turns on whether the result\r\n  represents a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of\r\n  the defendantâ€™s punishment.â€Â  Cuthrell, 475 F.2d at 1366.Â  Therefore, a\r\n  consequence that the defendant must be informed of is one which impacts the\r\n  sentence imposed on the defendant, and as such, is a direct consequence.Â  See State v. Armstrong, 263 S.C. 594, 598, 211 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1975)\r\n  (stating the defendant must be apprised of the direct consequences, which are\r\n  the direct and immediate results, of his guilty plea).Â  Â Â Â \r\nRegistration\r\n  on the sexual offender registry has no effect on the range of Williamsâ€™\r\n  punishment.Â  Registration is not intended to punish sex offenders, but rather\r\n  the purpose of requiring registration is â€œto protect the public from those sex\r\n  offenders who may re-offend and to aid law enforcement in solving sex crimes.â€Â  State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 31, 558 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2002).Â  The South\r\n  Carolina Sex Offender Registry Act (the Act) was created to be a non-punitive\r\n  act, and our Supreme Court has found that â€œthe Act is not so punitive in\r\n  purpose or effect as to constitute a criminal penalty.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the\r\n  consequence of registering as a sexual offender pursuant to the Act is\r\n  regulatory in nature and is imposed to promote public safety.Â  Accordingly, we agree\r\n  with the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that registration on the sexual offender registry\r\n  is a collateral consequence of Williamsâ€™ sentencing.Â  Consequently, Williamsâ€™\r\n  trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request the trial court to\r\n  make a determination as to whether the kidnapping was sexual in nature.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the decision of the PCR judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., and CURETON, AJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In granting Williamsâ€™ petition, we requested the\r\n  parties to brief whether the\r\n  PCR court was correct for finding Williamsâ€™ counsel was not ineffective for\r\n  failing to move to exempt Williams from sexual offender status and whether the\r\n  PCR court was correct for finding Williamsâ€™ counsel was not ineffective for\r\n  failing to advise Williams that he would be required to register as a sexual\r\n  offender unless the trial court ordered otherwise.Â  These issues are our sole\r\n  appellate considerations.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4399","title":"Pelzer v.

Pelzer (â€œPelzerâ€) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s summary dismissal of\r\n  his application for post-conviction relief (PCR) for failure to file within the\r\n  applicable statute of limitations. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL\r\n  / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  June 4, 2001, Pelzer pled guilty to first degree criminal sexual conduct and\r\n  kidnapping in Richland County.Â  Two twenty year, concurrent sentences were\r\n  imposed.Â  Pelzerâ€™s direct appeal was withdrawn on August 31, 2001.Â  \r\nPelzer\r\n  filed an application for post-conviction relief on September 16, 2002. Â Included\r\n  in his application were arguments based on (1) ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel, (2) lack of subject matter jurisdiction, (3) involuntary plea, and (4)\r\n  violation of due process. Â The State filed a return and motion to dismiss dated\r\n  July 25, 2003, and a hearing was held July 27, 2004.Â  The State asserted Pelzer\r\n  failed to comply with the one-year statute of limitations for filing post\r\n  conviction relief applications.Â  Additionally, the State moved for summary\r\n  judgment on Pelzerâ€™s claim that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  over his preliminary hearing.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record indicates Pelzerâ€™s application was notarized August 30, 2002, and Pelzer\r\n  asserts it was mailed the same day.Â  However, he admits it was incorrectly sent\r\n  to the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense who then forwarded the\r\n  application on September 5th to the proper recipient, the Richland\r\n  County Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit judge issued an order denying and dismissing Pelzerâ€™s application for\r\n  failing to comply with the one-year statute of limitations.Â  His claim of lack\r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction was likewise dismissed.Â  A petition for writ of\r\n  certiorari dated April 11, 2005, was filed.Â  Pursuant to Rule 227(1), SCACR,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court transferred the case to this court.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nSummary\r\n  dismissal of a PCR application without a hearing is appropriate only when (1)\r\n  it is apparent on the face of the application that there is no need for a\r\n  hearing to develop any facts and (2) the applicant is not entitled to relief.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-70(b)-(c) (2003); State v. Leamon, 363 S.C. 432,\r\n  611 S.E.2d 494 (2005). Â â€œWhen considering the Stateâ€™s\r\n  motion for summary dismissal of an application for PCR, a judge must assume\r\n  facts presented by an applicant are true and view those facts in the light most\r\n  favorable to the applicant.â€Â  Wilson v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 217, 559\r\n  S.E.2d 581, 582 (2002) (citing Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 363,\r\n  527 S.E.2d 742, 747 (2000)).Â  Likewise, this court must view the facts in the\r\n  same fashion when reviewing the appropriateness of a dismissal.Â  Leamon,\r\n  363 S.C. at 434, 611 S.E.2d at 494.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n  / ANALYSIS\r\nPelzer\r\n  requests his case be remanded for a full hearing arguing the statute of\r\n  limitations should be equitably tolled because he filed his application in the\r\n  wrong venue.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  statute of limitations for filing an application for PCR is one year.Â  Section\r\n  17-27-45(A) of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\n\tAn application for relief filed\r\n  pursuant to this chapter must be filed within one year after the entry of\r\n  judgment of conviction or within one year after the sending of the remittitur\r\n  to the lower court from an appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an\r\n  appeal, whichever is later.Â  \r\n\r\nMailing\r\n  does not constitute filing.Â  State v. Gary, 347 S.C.627, 629, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  662, 663 (2001).Â  â€œWhen a statute requires the filing of a paper or document,\r\n  it is filed when delivered to and received by the proper officer.â€Â  Gary, 347 S.C. at 629, 557 S.E.2d at 663 (citing Fox v. Union-Buffalo Mills,\r\n  226 S.C. 561, 86 S.E.2d 253 (1955)).Â  â€œUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-40 (1985),\r\n  the application must be filed with clerk of the court in which the conviction\r\n  took place.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nPelzerâ€™s remittitur is dated August 31, 2001.Â  One year after was August 31, 2002, and\r\n  adding one day pursuant to Rule 6(a), SCRCP, Pelzerâ€™s last day to file his\r\n  application was September 1, 2002.Â  Because September 1st was a\r\n  Sunday and Monday, September 2nd, was Labor Day, the period runs\r\n  until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a\r\n  holiday.Â  Rule 6(a), SCRCP.Â  Thus, the period expired Tuesday, September 3,\r\n  2002.Â  \r\nPelzer\r\n  admits the application was not â€œtechnicallyâ€ filed within one year.Â  However,\r\n  statutes of limitations are not simply technicalities, but are fundamental to a\r\n  well-ordered judicial system.Â  Moates v. Bobb, 322 S.C. 172, 176, 470\r\n  S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing C.S.J. Limitations of Actions Â§\r\n  2 (1989)).Â  \r\n\r\n\tStatutes of limitations embody important\r\n  public policy considerations in that they stimulate activity, punish\r\n  negligence, and promote repose by giving security and stability to human\r\n  affairs.Â  One purpose of a statute of limitations is to relieve the courts of\r\n  the burden of trying stale claims when a plaintiff has slept on his rights.Â \r\n  Another purpose of a statute of limitations is to protect potential defendants\r\n  from protracted fear of litigation.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nEquitable\r\n  tolling is a doctrine rarely applied in South Carolina to stop the running of\r\n  statutes of limitations.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Svcs. and Rehabilitation\r\n    Ctr., 377 S.C. 217, 230, 659 S.E.2d 213, 219 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  â€œEquitable\r\n  tolling is reserved for extraordinary circumstances.â€Â  Id.; see, e.g., Irwin v. Depâ€™t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990) (stating that\r\n  while equitable tolling was allowed where claimant actively pursued remedies\r\n  but filed defective pleading, or was induced by adversary into allowing\r\n  deadline to pass, â€œ[w]e have generally been much less forgiving in receiving\r\n  late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving\r\n  his legal rights.â€); Hopkins v. Floydâ€™s Wholesale, 299 S.C. 127, 382\r\n  S.E.2d 907 (1989) (holding statute of limitations equitably tolled for workersâ€™\r\n  compensation claim during reliance period in which employer represented to\r\n  employee that claim compensable and would be taken care of without employee\r\n  filing claim). Â The doctrine of equitable tolling can be summarized:\r\n\r\n\tThe time requirements in lawsuits\r\n  between private litigants are customarily subject to equitable tolling if such\r\n  tolling is necessary to prevent unfairness to a diligent plaintiff.Â  However,\r\n  equitable tolling, which allows a plaintiff to initiate an action beyond the\r\n  statute of limitations deadline, is typically available only if the claimant\r\n  was prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising his or her rights, or,\r\n  in other words, if the relevant facts present sufficiently rare and exceptional\r\n  circumstances that would warrant application of the doctrine.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tEquitable tolling has been deemed \r\n\t\t\t\tavailable whereâ€” \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tâ€”\r\n\t\t\t\textraordinary circumstances prevented the \r\n\t\t\t\tplaintiff from filing despite his or her diligence.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tâ€”\r\n\t\t\t\tthe plaintiff actively pursued his or her \r\n\t\t\t\tjudicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the \r\n\t\t\t\tstatutory period or the claimant has been induced or tricked by \r\n\t\t\t\tthe defendant's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to \r\n\t\t\t\tpass.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tâ€”\r\n\t\t\t\tthe plaintiff, despite all due diligence, is \r\n\t\t\t\tunable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of \r\n\t\t\t\this or her claim. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIt has been held that equitable tolling\r\n  applies principally if the plaintiff is actively misled by the defendant about\r\n  the cause of action or is prevented in some extraordinary way from asserting\r\n  his or her rights.Â  However, it has also been held that the equitable tolling\r\n  doctrine does not require wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, such\r\n  as fraud or misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n51\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Limitation of Actions Â§ 174 (2007); see also Hooper,\r\n  377 S.C. at 232, 659 S.E.2d at 221.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Pelzer has not alleged any wrongdoing by the State. Â Rather, Pelzer relies on\r\n  our Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Gary v. State, 347 S.C. 627, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  662 (2001), to demand equitable tolling. Â We find this reliance misplaced.Â \r\n  Pelzer states Gary held â€œthat the statute of limitations should be\r\n  equitably tolled when an application is simply filed in the wrong venue.â€Â Â  In Gary, the applicant claimed he had mailed his PCR application within the one-year\r\n  limitation period but to the wrong place.Â  The period had run when the\r\n  application came back.Â  Our Supreme Court did not address his equitable tolling\r\n  argument finding it was not preserved.Â  A footnote specifically clarified,\r\n  â€œ[w]e express no opinion on the validity of this defense to the statute of\r\n  limitations.â€Â  Id. at 629, 557 S.E.2d at 663, n. 2.\r\nAt the dismissal hearing, Pelzerâ€™s counsel contended\r\n  Pelzerâ€™s misunderstanding of where to file was â€œunderstandable given his status\r\n  as a layman and his lack of knowledge of the law.â€Â  We disagree that his error\r\n  resulted from any lack of legal skill rather than simple neglect.Â  Pelzerâ€™s PCR\r\n  application, which was filled out by hand and signed, clearly instructs:Â  â€œWhen\r\n  the application is completed, the original shall be mailed to the Clerk of\r\n  Court for the County in which applicant was convicted.â€Â  Three lines below this\r\n  directive, the applicant is asked to name the location of the court which\r\n  imposed his sentence.Â  Pelzer answered â€œRichland County.â€Â  Under these facts,\r\n  the narrow window by which Pelzerâ€™s application missed the statute of limitations\r\n  cannot be construed as so exceptional a circumstance as to warrant equitable\r\n  tolling.Â  The reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in\r\n  denying equitable tolling to a party is particularly illuminating:\r\n\r\n\t[A]ny invocation of equity\r\n  to relieve the strict application of a statute of limitations must be guarded and infrequent, lest\r\n  circumstances of individualized hardship supplant the rules of clearly drafted\r\n  statutes. To apply equity generously would loose the rule of law to whims about\r\n  the adequacy of excuses, divergent responses to claims of hardship, and\r\n  subjective notions of fair accommodation. We believe, therefore, that any\r\n  resort to equity must be reserved for those rare instances where--due to\r\n  circumstances external to the party's own conduct--it would be unconscionable\r\n  to enforce the limitation period against the party and gross injustice would\r\n  result.\r\n\r\nHarris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding habeas petitionerâ€™s missing filing deadline due to\r\n  erroneous advice from counsel not extraordinary circumstance requiring equitable\r\n  tolling).\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary dismissal\r\n  of Pelzerâ€™s PCR application.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide\r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4400","title":"Bryson v.

Simmons, Jr., Special Referee\r\nOpinion No.Â  4400\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2008 â€“ Filed June 5, 2008Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid R. Harrison, of Pickens, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam Douglas Richardson, of Easley, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Carl N. Bryson (Carl), as personal representative (PR) of Conrad\r\n  Ardell Brysonâ€™s (Ardell) estate, sued Herman Billy Bryson (Billy) for breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty.Â  The special referee awarded the estate $306,786.49 in damages\r\n  and set aside a deed that Ardell transferred to Billy.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 8, 1997, Ardell appointed\r\n  Billy, his half-brother, as his power of attorney.Â  From 2001 until Ardellâ€™s\r\n  death, Billy spent time with Ardell and took him to the doctor.Â  In 1997, Dr.\r\n  Thomas E. Parrish (Dr. Parrish) diagnosed Ardell with severe dementia, and\r\n  later in 1998, Dr. Parrish diagnosed Ardell with Alzheimerâ€™s disease.Â  Billy\r\n  testified he was unaware of the diagnoses.Â  However, several witnesses\r\n  testified Ardellâ€™s symptoms and behavior stemming from Alzheimerâ€™s disease were\r\n  apparent.Â  Â Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Dr. Parrish opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Ardell\r\n  was not capable of caring for himself.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Parrish testified\r\n  Ardell did not have the mental competency to make everyday decisions, transfer\r\n  personal or real property, or handle his finances.Â  Glenda Bryson Smith\r\n  (Glenda) and Laura Jane Smith (Laura), Ardellâ€™s caretakers, testified Ardell displayed\r\n  signs of his illness and acted in a childlike manner.Â  Further, Glenda\r\n  testified Billy hired her to care for Ardell and he knew about Ardellâ€™s\r\n  condition.Â  \r\nAfter Billyâ€™s\r\n  power of attorney appointment, he and Ardell opened a joint bank account, and\r\n  several checks were written from that account.Â  One check for $50,000 was\r\n  written as a loan to an insurance company, which Billy testified was an\r\n  investment in Hal Blackwell Insurance Company.Â  Billy paid off his sonâ€™s\r\n  mortgage with another check from the joint account in the amount of $25,877.Â  Billy\r\n  also purchased a car, paid for home improvements, took out cash, and made\r\n  several other purchases for his personal benefit with Ardellâ€™s funds while\r\n  acting as Ardellâ€™s power of attorney.Â  Additionally, Ardell deeded property to\r\n  Billy without consideration on August 8, 2002.Â Â Â  \r\nCarl, as PR of Ardellâ€™s estate, filed a\r\n  summons and complaint against Billy in Pickens County on August 18, 2004,\r\n  alleging Billy breached his fiduciary duty as Ardellâ€™s power of attorney and\r\n  committed fraud and conversion.Â  Billyâ€™s answer sought dismissal of the action,\r\n  but the case proceeded to trial in front of a special referee.[1]Â  \r\nAt trial, Billy sought to have Ardellâ€™s neighbor, Brian Lloyd\r\n  Smith (Smith), a witness whom Billy did not name in his answers to the\r\n  interrogatories and whom Carl was not informed of until the morning of the\r\n  trial, testify as to his observations of Ardell.Â  The special referee allowed\r\n  Billy to proffer Smithâ€™s testimony but ultimately excluded the evidence.Â  Additionally,\r\n  at the close of trial, Billy moved for an involuntary nonsuit, claiming Carl\r\n  was not the real party in interest.Â  The special referee denied this motion.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe special referee found Billy breached his fiduciary duty to\r\n  Ardell and awarded the estate $306,786.49.Â  Additionally, the special referee ordered\r\n  the deed of real property, which Ardell transferred to Billy and executed on\r\n  August 8, 2002, be set aside in its entirety except for the portion of the\r\n  parcel Ardell transferred to Providence Christian Academy.Â  The special referee\r\n  ordered the property be included in Ardellâ€™s estate.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[A] claim of\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law[,] and the trial [courtâ€™s]\r\n  findings will be upheld unless without evidentiary support.â€Â  Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005).Â  Accordingly, our\r\n  standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law, and â€œwe\r\n  will not disturb the refereeâ€™s factual findings that have some evidentiary\r\n  support.â€Â  Jones v. Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 314, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Exclusion of a Witness\r\nBilly contends the special referee erred in excluding\r\n  Smithâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  decision of whether or not to allow a witness to testify who was not previously\r\n  listed on answers to interrogatories rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial [court].â€ Â Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C. 142, 150, 558 S.E.2d 911,\r\n  915 (Ct. App. 2001) (citation omitted). Â â€œExclusion of a witness is a sanction\r\n  which should never be lightly invoked.â€Â  Id. at 149, 558 S.E.2d at 915\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  Before imposing the sanction of excluding a witness, a\r\n  trial court is required to consider and evaluate several factors:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(1) the\r\n  type of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence emanating from the\r\n  proffered witness; (3) the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to\r\n  furnish the witnessâ€™ name; (4) the degree of surprise to the other party,\r\n  including the prior knowledge of the name of the witness; and (5) the prejudice\r\n  to the opposing party.\r\n\r\nId. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at 916.Â  \r\nIn Barnette\r\n  v. Adams Bros. Logging, Inc., the South Carolina Supreme Court found the\r\n  trial court abused its discretion in excluding an expert witness when there was\r\n  no disobedience of any court order and no prejudice to the opposing party other\r\n  than necessity of further discovery.Â  355 S.C. 588, 593, 586 S.E.2d 572, 575\r\n  (2003).Â  Additionally, our Supreme Court stated the exclusion rule is designed\r\n  to promote decisions on the merits after a full and fair hearing, and the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s sanction should serve to protect the rights of discovery provided by\r\n  the rules of civil procedure.Â  Id. at 592, 586 S.E.2d at 574. Â In\r\n  recognizing the potentially harsh sanctions a trial court may invoke in\r\n  addition to the sanction of exclusion of a witness, our Supreme Court noted, â€œA\r\n  sanction of dismissal is too severe if there is no evidence of any intentional\r\n  misconduct.â€Â  Id. (internal citations omitted). \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in Orlando v. Boyd, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s sanction when no evidence of intentional misconduct existed in the\r\n  record to â€œwarrant the exclusion of a crucial witness.â€Â  320 S.C. 509, 512, 466\r\n  S.E.2d 353, 355 (1996).Â  Our Supreme Court held, â€œ[When] the effect will be the\r\n  same as granting judgment by default or dismissal, a preclusion order may be\r\n  made only if there is some showing of willful disobedience or gross\r\n  indifference to the rights of the adverse party.â€Â  Id. at 511, 466\r\n  S.E.2d at 355.\r\nPreviously, this Court found it is within the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s discretion to allow an appropriate sanction when a party fails to\r\n  strictly comply with a scheduling order.Â  Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic,\r\n  368 S.C. 326, 338, 628 S.E.2d 894, 900 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Therefore, when\r\n  noncompliance is undisputed, the question becomes whether the trial court\r\n  abused its discretion in imposing exclusion of a witness as a sanction.Â  Id.Â  Though the trial court did not specifically enunciate the Jumper factors, this Court found the trial court â€œconsidered the requisite factors and\r\n  made the appropriate inquiry before ultimately excluding the challenged\r\n  witnesses.â€Â  Id. at 339, 628 S.E.2d at 901.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Billy attempted to call Smith as a witness, and Carl objected\r\n  because Smithâ€™s name was not provided in the answers to interrogatories.Â \r\n  Additionally, Carl was not informed Billy was calling Smith as a witness until\r\n  the morning of the trial.Â  The special referee allowed Billy to proffer Smithâ€™s\r\n  testimony, and based on the content of Smithâ€™s proffer, the special referee\r\n  excluded Smith as a witness.Â  By virtue of the proffer, we find the special\r\n  referee properly considered the Jumper factors.Â  Cf. Jumper,\r\n  348 S.C. at 150-51, 558 S.E.2d at 916 (â€œ[T]he court never made an inquiry into\r\n  the content of the evidence [the expert witness] would offer. By not getting any information about the proposed witnessâ€™ testimony, the court did not meet its\r\n  duty of discovering and evaluating the content of the potential evidence.â€)\r\n  (emphasis in original).\r\nBilly\r\n  wished to call Smith as a fact witness,[2] and through his proffer, Smith explained he had known Ardell his whole life and\r\n  was his neighbor for several years.Â  Smith also stated Ardellâ€™s will named the\r\n  chairman of the board of deacons of their church as administrator of his\r\n  estate.Â  Further, Smith stated Ardell appeared lucid, competent, and able to\r\n  understand conversations.Â  Therefore, the special referee properly considered\r\n  the type of witness Smith would be and the content of his proposed testimony as\r\n  required by the first and second factors of Jumper.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the special referee satisfied the third Jumper factor by considering the\r\n  nature of Billyâ€™s failure to furnish Smithâ€™s name as a witness, stating, â€œIt is\r\n  clear from his testimony he is here as a result of a conversation with your\r\n  client prior to ever receiving a letter from [Carlâ€™s attorney].Â  And the\r\n  motivating factor was a personal contact with your client as opposed to\r\n  notification that there was a trial.â€Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the fourth and fifth Jumper factors, this late notification\r\n  inevitably created significant surprise and prejudice to Ardellâ€™s estate and\r\n  its representatives.Â  The failure to inform the estate until the morning of the\r\n  trial that Smith would be a witness left the estate with an insufficient amount\r\n  of time to adequately prepare for an examination of Smith and eliminated the\r\n  estateâ€™s opportunity to depose Smith.Â  See Arthur, 368 S.C. at\r\n  341, 628 S.E.2d at 902 (finding the respondent was significantly surprised and\r\n  prejudiced when the appellant failed to give notice of two witnesses until the\r\n  Friday before trial because the respondent was not able to depose the witnesses\r\n  before trial). Â \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the special referee properly considered all factors\r\n  set forth in Jumper when deciding to exclude Smith as a witness, and\r\n  therefore, the exclusion was not an abuse of discretion.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nII.Â  Involuntary Nonsuit\r\nBilly also contends\r\n  the special referee erred in failing to grant his motion for an involuntary nonsuit.Â \r\n  Specifically, Billy argues Carl, as PR of Ardellâ€™s estate, is not the real\r\n  party in interest.Â  We disagree.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  17(a), SCRCP, provides in part: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tEvery\r\n  action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.Â  An\r\n  executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party\r\n  with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another,\r\n  or a party authorized by statute may sue in his own name without joining with\r\n  him the party for whose benefit the action is brought; and when a statute so\r\n  provides, an action for the use or benefit of another shall be brought in the\r\n  name of the State.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nUnless\r\n  a party promptly challenges the opposing partyâ€™s status as a real party in\r\n  interest, such a challenge is waived.Â  Bardoon Props., NV v. Eidolon Corp.,\r\n  326 S.C. 166, 169, 485 S.E.2d 371, 373 (1997) (â€œA challenge to a partyâ€™s status\r\n  as real party in interest must be made promptly or the court may conclude the\r\n  point has been waived.â€).\r\nWe\r\n  find Billy waived his right to challenge Carlâ€™s status as the real party in\r\n  interest.Â  Billy first raised this argument at the close of trial.[3]Â \r\n  Although Billy asserts he raised such a motion at the beginning of trial as\r\n  well, the record is devoid of such evidence.Â  As the appellant, Billy bears the\r\n  burden of presenting a sufficient record for review. Â See Helms\r\n    Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339-40, 611 S.E.2d 485, 487-88\r\n  (2005) (stating the appellant has the burden of providing a sufficient record\r\n  on appeal).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Billy has failed to provide a sufficient record for our review in this matter,\r\n  we affirm the special refereeâ€™s denial of Billyâ€™s motion for an involuntary\r\n  nonsuit.Â  See Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329\r\n  S.C. 433, 447, 494 S.E.2d 827, 834 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding the appellate court\r\n  must affirm the trial court on an issue when the appellant fails to provide\r\n  adequate materials for this Court to consider the argument).Â  Â Â Â \r\nIII.Â  Repayment from\r\n  Property Sale\r\nFinally,\r\n  Billy argues the special referee erred in ordering him to repay monies from a\r\n  sale of property when the special referee did not set aside the sale of\r\n  property.Â  We find this issue abandoned on appeal.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument\r\n  is raised in a brief but not supported by authority. Historic Charleston\r\n    Holdings, L.L.C. v. Mallon, 365 S.C. 524, 533 n.7, 617 S.E.2d 388, 393 n.7\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Billy failed to cite any authority in support of his\r\n  assertion the special referee erred in ordering him to repay proceeds from the\r\n  sale of property.Â  Therefore, Billy abandoned this issue on appeal, and we\r\n  decline to consider the argument.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the special refereeâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both parties consented to have this matter referred\r\n  to a special referee.\r\n[2] We note Barnette and Orlando involved\r\n  the exclusion of expert witnesses rather than the exclusion of a lay witness as\r\n  in the present case.Â  After excluding the expert witnesses, the trial courts\r\n  dismissed the cases.Â Â Â  Barnette, 355 S.C. at 591, 586 S.E.2d at 574; Orlando, 320 S.C. at 511, 466 S.E.2d at 355.Â  The exclusion of Smithâ€™s testimony,\r\n  however, did not lead to such a dramatic result.Â  Further, Smithâ€™s testimony,\r\n  while favorable to Billy, was not as crucial to the case as were the witnessesâ€™\r\n  testimonies in Barnette and Orlando.Â  These distinctions support\r\n  the conclusion the special refereeâ€™s exclusion was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n[3] Billy argues Ardell appointed members of the Six Mile Baptist Church as executors of his estate through his will and made no provisions\r\n  for a PR.\r\n[4] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4401","title":"Doe v.

Bryson, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:&nbsp; John Doe (Father) appeals the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order terminating his parental rights to his biological child (Child)\r\n  and ordering payment of his attorney's fees and $1,635.50 in guardian ad litem\r\n  fees.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 2004, Jane Roe (Mother) learned she\r\n  was pregnant and informed two men that one of them is Childâ€™s father.Â  Eight\r\n  months later, on March 6, 2005, Child was born.Â  Both potential fathers were at\r\n  the hospital for Childâ€™s birth.Â  The man excluded from being Childâ€™s biological\r\n  father assisted Mother in the delivery room and served as Motherâ€™s birth coach.[1]Â  Father was not permitted in the\r\n  delivery room during Childâ€™s birth.Â  While at the hospital the day after Childâ€™s\r\n  birth, Mother indicated she was uncomfortable and wanted Father to leave.Â  As a\r\n  result, she requested that her father (Grandfather) ask Father to leave. \r\nLess\r\n  than a week after Childâ€™s birth and prior to any determination as to paternity,\r\n  Grandfather called Father to meet with him to discuss the rights and\r\n  responsibilities of parenthood should the paternity test reveal Father to be Childâ€™s\r\n  biological father. Â During this conversation, Grandfather indicated that\r\n  child support and visitation are inextricably linked. Â Grandfather further\r\n  suggested the possibility of termination of parental rights should Father decide\r\n  he did not want to assume parental responsibilities.[2]Â  Additionally, Grandfather directed\r\n  Father to the DSS website and indicated that the site includes a child support\r\n  calculator. \r\nOn March 15, 2005, nine days after Childâ€™s birth, Grandfather\r\n  informed Father a paternity test had excluded the other man as Childâ€™s father.Â \r\n  The same day, Mother e-mailed photos of Child to Father.Â  The next day, Father\r\n  told his mother about the paternity test results, and the following day she visited\r\n  Child with a gift.Â  \r\nOn December 15, 2005, Father filed a complaint\r\n  asking the court to establish his paternity and to award attorney's fees and costs.Â \r\n  Father additionally sought an award of custody or liberal visitation and to\r\n  issue a restraining order against Mother should his paternity be established.Â  In Motherâ€™s\r\n  answer, she agreed to Fatherâ€™s request for a paternity determination; she also\r\n  counterclaimed, asking the court to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights (TPR)\r\n  and to award attorney's fees and costs.Â  Mother further requested: (1) that the\r\n  court hold in abeyance the issues of child support and visitation, pending the\r\n  courtâ€™s TPR decision; (2) that the court issue a restraining order against\r\n  Father; and (3) that the court award attorney's fees and costs.Â  In a temporary\r\n  order, the court ordered paternity testing and appointed Patricia Forbis as\r\n  Childâ€™s guardian ad litem (GAL).Â  On June\r\n  8, 2006, Mother and Father agreed to bifurcate the issues in order to expedite a\r\n  decision regarding TPR. Â Additionally, they agreed the court would thereafter determine\r\n  GAL and attorney's fees only if Fatherâ€™s parental rights were terminated. Â \r\nThe\r\n  hearing on the TPR issue was held on October 9 and 10, 2006.Â  Child was then\r\n  nineteen months old.Â  At the call of the hearing, the court was advised a\r\n  paternity test had determined Father was Childâ€™s father; neither party\r\n  contested this finding.[3]Â \r\n  In its written order of December 19, 2006, the court terminated Fatherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights based upon its finding that clear and convincing evidence\r\n  supported TPR on the statutory grounds of failure to visit and failure to support\r\n  Child for six months and finding TPR was in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  The court further\r\n  ordered Mother and Father to pay their own attorney's fees, ordered Mother to\r\n  pay GAL fees of $845.50, and ordered Father to pay GAL fees of $1,635.50.Â \r\n  Fatherâ€™s petition for supersedeas was denied on June 6, 2007.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn TPR proceedings,\r\n  the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby\r\n    Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  Before\r\n  parental rights can be permanently terminated, the alleged grounds for\r\n  termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v.\r\n    Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982).Â  On appeal, this\r\n  court may review the record and make its own determination whether grounds for\r\n  termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â Â \r\n  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we are not required to disregard\r\n  the findings of the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, and was in a\r\n  better position to assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  In reviewing TPR cases, we note â€œ[t]he termination of the legal relationship\r\n  between natural parents and a child presents one [of] the most difficult issues\r\n  this [c]ourt is called upon to decide.â€ Charleston County Depâ€™t. of Soc. Serv. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, 105, 631 S.E.2d 239, 244 (2006)\r\n  (alteration in original) (citations omitted).Â Â  As a result, â€œ[w]e exercise great\r\n  caution in reviewing termination proceedings and will conclude termination is\r\n  proper only when the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates such a result.â€Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn South Carolina, procedures for TPR are governed by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  20-7-1560 to 1582 (Supp. 2007).Â  The purpose of the TPR statute is:\r\n\r\n\tto\r\n  establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of\r\n  parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to\r\n  protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for\r\n  adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love\r\n  and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court may order TPR upon a finding of one or more of the eleven\r\n  statutory grounds and a finding that TPR is in the best interest of the\r\n  child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2007).Â  The TPR statute\r\n  â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for\r\n  freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by\r\n  terminating the parent-child relationship.Â  The interests of the child shall\r\n  prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nFather first alleges it was improper for the family court to\r\n  determine his paternity and terminate his parental rights in the same order.Â  This\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nThis\r\n  argument was not raised to the family court and is, therefore, not preserved\r\n  for our review.Â  â€œIt is an axiomatic rule of law that issues may not be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal.â€Â  Talley v. S.C. Higher Educ. Tuition Grants Comm., 289\r\n  S.C. 483, 487, 347 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1986).Â  Additionally, we note Father and\r\n  Mother signed an order bifurcating the issues to expedite the TPR\r\n  determination.Â  See Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 139-40,\r\n  580 S.E.2d 109, 114-15 (2003) (stating â€œpetitioner cannot now complain the trial court erred when it took [his] own\r\n  suggestionâ€).\r\nNext, Father asserts the family court erred in finding clear and\r\n  convincing evidence exists to establish the statutory grounds of willful\r\n  failure to visit and willful failure to support.Â  Although we disagree that the\r\n  family court erred with regard to these statutory grounds, we need not address this\r\n  argument in light of our ruling on whether termination is in the best interest of\r\n  the child.Â  \r\nFather argues the family court erred in determining TPR was in\r\n  Childâ€™s best interest.Â  We agree.Â  â€œIf\r\n  the family court finds that a statutory ground for [TPR] has been proven, it\r\n  must then find that the best interests of the child would be served by [TPR].â€Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 580, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003).Â  In a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount\r\n  consideration.Â  Id. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the\r\n  childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  However, â€œ[t]he public policy of this state in child custody\r\n  matters is to reunite parents and children.â€ Â Hooper v. Rockwell, 334\r\n  S.C. 281, 296, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-20.Â  The\r\n  supreme court has recognized a child's shared interest in preventing an\r\n  erroneous termination of the familial bond with a child's natural parent.Â  Greenville County Dep't Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 196, 437\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 111 (1993).Â  Furthermore, there is a presumption that it is in the\r\n  best interest of a child to be in the custody of its biological parent.Â  Shake\r\n    v. Darlington County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 306 S.C. 216, 222, 410 S.E.2d\r\n  923, 926 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 79, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 456, 458 (1989)). Â \r\nTerminating\r\n  parental rights can forever sever the relationship between parent and child.Â  As\r\n  a result of the gravity of the effect of termination on a parent-child\r\n  relationship, our courts have routinely held that a decision to terminate\r\n  parental rights should be reached only when the evidence supports a finding that\r\n  termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  In an effort to protect an\r\n  individualâ€™s parental rights to children born out of wedlock, this court, in Charleston County Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, reversed the family courtâ€™s\r\n  order terminating fatherâ€™s parental rights&nbsp;where father was incarcerated\r\n  and unable to connect with child.Â  368 S.C. 87, 103, 627 S.E.2d 765, 774 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).Â  In reasoning that TPR was not in childâ€™s best interest, the court\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n\tterminating\r\n  Father's parental rights will not ensure future stability for Child.\r\n  Moreover, keeping Father's parental rights intact will not disrupt Child's current living situation. Father does not gain custody of Child simply\r\n  because the Department failed to terminate his parental rights at this time.\r\n  Rather, by not terminating Father's parental rights, Father merely maintains\r\n  his right to connect with Child as well as his obligation to\r\n  support Child, emotionally, financially, or otherwise. The Department should,\r\n  in the best interest of Child, facilitate this connection and\r\n  accompanying obligation.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).Â  Â The Jackson court ruled in\r\n  favor of father despite the inevitable lack of conventional support the\r\n  incarcerated father could provide child while in prison.Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  finding that termination was not in child's best interest, the court noted that\r\n  the child resided in a therapeutic foster home and child's foster parents had\r\n  not expressed an interest in adopting him.Â  Id.Â  Because there was no\r\n  evidence that the foster parents had plans to adopt child, the court found\r\n  terminating father's parental rights would not ensure future stability for\r\n  child and keeping father's rights intact would not disrupt child's current\r\n  living situation. Â Id. \r\nHere,\r\n  as in Jackson, there is no indication that terminating Father's rights\r\n  will ensure future stability for Child or that keeping Father's parental rights\r\n  intact will disrupt Child's current living situation. Â Instead, keeping\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parental rights intact simply allows Father to establish a\r\n  relationship with Child and to provide emotional and financial support for\r\n  Child. Â While we acknowledge that there is some evidence to suggest that Mother\r\n  had plans to marry and that fiancÃ© may adopt Child, these plans have not been\r\n  finalized.Â  Further, at oral argument, nearly three years after Mother's\r\n  engagement, counsel was unable to confirm such plans.[4] Â Thus, while we recognize that a stable family relationship may be in a child's\r\n  best interest, we find the request herein to be premature based on the record\r\n  presented. If anything, given Mother's situation and Father's demonstrated\r\n  desire to establish a relationship with Child, we find that keeping Father's\r\n  rights intact under these circumstances will only serve to benefit Child by\r\n  allowing the familial bond between Father and Child to be furthered.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  Father is both capable and willing to provide the necessary emotional, financial,\r\n  and other obligations embodied in a parentâ€™s right to care for a biological\r\n  child.Â  Since Father demonstrates his desire to establish a relationship with\r\n  Child and because keeping Fatherâ€™s rights intact need not disrupt the quality\r\n  of Childâ€™s life, the record fails to demonstrate that it would be in Childâ€™s\r\n  best interest to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights at this time.Â  Instead,\r\n  based on the record, we find Father should have the opportunity to connect with\r\n  Child in such manner deemed appropriate under the reasoned view of the family\r\n  court.Â  \r\nNext, Father\r\n  contends the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate his parental rights violates\r\n  his constitutional right to have a relationship with his biological child.Â \r\n  Because this issue was not raised to the family court, it is not preserved for\r\n  our review.Â  Further, due to our disposition herein, we need not address this\r\n  issue.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311\r\n  S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (finding the court need not address remaining\r\n  issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nFather also argues the family court erred\r\n  by ordering him to pay GAL fees of $1,635.50\r\n  and his own attorney's fees.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nFather fails to support his argument with\r\n  authority; therefore, the argument is conclusory and is abandoned on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR.\r\n  Â Notwithstanding, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion and\r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s order regarding GAL and attorney's fees. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that termination of\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parental rights is premature at this juncture and is, therefore, not\r\n  in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  Accordingly, we remand this case to the family court\r\n  to issue an order of visitation and to establish Fatherâ€™s duty of support. Â Additionally,\r\n  we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Father to pay\r\n  his own attorney's and GAL fees.Â Â  For the foregoing reasons, the order of the\r\n  family court is\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The man excluded from being Childâ€™s biological father\r\n  is now Motherâ€™s fiancÃ©. Â Mother testified they began an exclusive relationship\r\n  in December 2004 and became engaged in May 2005.Â  Â \r\n[2] This conversation took place before the paternity\r\n  test revealed Child's biological father.\r\n[3] A\r\n  paternity test conducted in March 2006 confirmed Father was Childâ€™s biological\r\n  father; however, the family court was not notified of this prior to the October\r\n  2006 TPR hearing.Â  \r\n[4] Additionally, we note that one of the primary\r\n  purposes of TPR is to immediately free the child for adoption.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2007).Â  This is especially true in cases where a child is\r\n  faced with abuse and neglect.Â  Following their engagement in May 2005, Mother\r\n  and fiancÃ© planned to be married in October of 2006.Â  This date was cancelled.Â \r\n  At oral argument, there was no evidence of record that the couple had\r\n  subsequently married or set a new date.Â  Again, we consider this only for\r\n  purposes of whether there exists some beneficial interest to Child to be part\r\n  of some other stable family relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4402","title":"State v.

Cordell Maddox, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4402\r\nHeard March 4, 2008 â€“ Filed June 5, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney\r\n  General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina T.\r\n  Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:&nbsp; In this criminal action, Terry T. Tindall appeals the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling that a search and seizure did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Â \r\n  Tindall also appeals the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge the jury on the issue\r\n  of third-party guilt.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the morning of April 15, 2004, Oconee\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Sergeant Dale Colegrove was patrolling part of Interstate\r\n  85 in Oconee County.Â  Colegrove stopped Tindall about 7 a.m. for speeding and\r\n  following another vehicle too closely.Â  Colegrove wrote Tindall a warning\r\n  ticket but continued to talk to him.Â  Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes\r\n  into the stop, Tindall allegedly consented to a search of the vehicle.Â  Sergeant\r\n  Colegrove and other officers discovered three packages of cocaine under the\r\n  rear bumper of the vehicle, weighing a total of 2,380 grams.\r\nA grand jury indicted Tindall for\r\n  trafficking in cocaine in excess of four hundred grams.Â  At trial,\r\n  Tindall moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the search.Â  Colegrove\r\n  and Tindall testified in camera during the suppression hearing.Â  \r\nTindall testified that the morning of his arrest, he was traveling\r\n  from his home in Hampton, Georgia to visit his brother in Durham, North Carolina. He testified he and his brother were going to Wilmington, North Carolina â€œto take care of some businessâ€ for their mother.Â  The vehicle Tindall was\r\n  driving at the time of his stop was rented to Lee Braggs.Â  Tindall was named an\r\n  authorized driver, as was another individual, Lewis Wilkerson.Â  Tindall\r\n  testified his car was not reliable enough to make the trip and because he did\r\n  not have a credit card, Braggs had rented the vehicle for him.\r\nAfter Colegrove pulled Tindall over, he\r\n  informed Tindall he had been speeding, swerving, and following too closely.Â  Tindall\r\n  denied speeding or following too closely.Â  Colegrove requested Tindall\r\n  exit the vehicle and sit in the front seat of his patrol car.Â  As Colegrove\r\n  questioned Tindall, two other police cars arrived.\r\nColegrove asked Tindall how long he would\r\n  be in North Carolina, and he replied he would only be there for the day.[1]Â  Tindall testified he informed Colegrove\r\n  he intended to leave the rental car in Durham and his brother was going to drive\r\n  him back to Hampton.Â  Tindall explained that once the car was in Durham, Braggs, a restaurateur, needed the car to pick up seafood in North Carolina or Florida.Â  Tindall testified Braggs knew Tindall did not have the means to get to Durham, so Braggs rented the car and let Tindall drive it to Durham. Â Tindall also said\r\n  Braggs â€œneeded to get to Durham quicker than driving there.Â  He needed to get\r\n  to Durham to take care of some business, and he needed the car once he got to Durham.â€\r\nColegrove returned Tindallâ€™s license and other\r\n  documents, along with a warning ticket. Â Tindall testified he did not\r\n  feel as though he could leave because Colegrove was still talking to him and\r\n  the other officers were standing beside the door of the police car.Â  He further\r\n  testified Colegrove never informed him he could leave.Â  Colegrove then asked\r\n  Tindall if he could search the car and Tindall replied: â€œI donâ€™t care or . . .\r\n  I donâ€™t mind.â€ Â Tindall testified he believed the stop lasted twenty\r\n  minutes but was not surprised to learn the videotape from Colegroveâ€™s car\r\n  revealed it was only twelve minutes. \r\nColegrove testified he observed Tindall\r\n  traveling seventy-three miles per hour in a sixty-five-mile-per-hour zone.Â  He\r\n  also observed him following another car too closely and crossing the white\r\n  line.Â  Colegrove decided to stop Tindall and started the videotape equipment in\r\n  Â his vehicle.Â  Colegrove testified when Tindall exited the vehicle he did a\r\n  â€œfelony stretch,â€ raising his hands as â€œkind of a stress relief action,â€ which\r\n  police officers are taught to look for in criminal patrol classes.Â  He further\r\n  testified Tindall continued to act very nervous even after learning he would\r\n  only receive a warning ticket. Â He also testified normally once people\r\n  learn they will not receive a ticket their nervousness subsides, but Tindall\r\n  continued to have a rapid heartbeat.Â  On cross-examination, Colegrove admitted\r\n  he did not document Tindallâ€™s physical manifestations of nervousness in his\r\n  report. \r\nAdditionally, Colegrove testified he found\r\n  the circumstances of Tindallâ€™s trip suspicious because the car had to be\r\n  returned to Atlanta that same day and Tindall was not the renter of record.Â  Also,\r\n  Colegrove testified the cities traveled to and from were considered â€œdrug\r\n  hubs.â€Â  Based on his observations, Colegrove concluded Tindall was concealing\r\n  something illegal inside the car.\r\nFollowing the suppression hearing, the trial court denied\r\n  Tindallâ€™s motion to suppress finding Colegrove had a reasonable suspicion that\r\n  something illegal was occurring.Â  Tindall also moved to suppress a statement he\r\n  gave to officers at the scene of the arrest.Â  The trial court denied the motion\r\n  to suppress the statement. \r\nThe jury convicted Tindall of trafficking in cocaine.Â  The trial\r\n  court sentenced Tindall to twenty-five years imprisonment and assessed a\r\n  $250,000 fine.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has articulated the standard of review to apply to\r\n  Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases. Â State v. Brockman, 339 S.C.\r\n  57, 528 S.E.2d 661 (2000). Â A trial courtâ€™s factual rulings are reviewed under\r\n  the â€œclear errorâ€ standard, like any other factual finding.Â  Id. at 66,\r\n  528 S.E.2d at 666.Â  The appellate court will affirm if any evidence supports\r\n  the ruling and reverse only if there is clear error.Â  Id. Â Under the â€œclear errorâ€ standard, an\r\n  appellate court will not reverse a trial courtâ€™s finding of fact simply because\r\n  it would have decided the case differently. Â State v. Pichardo,&nbsp;367\r\n  S.C. 84, 95-96, 623 S.E.2d 840, 846&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Fourth Amendment\r\n  Violation\r\nTindall contends the trial court erred in denying his\r\n  motion to suppress the cocaine because the traffic stop and subsequent encounter\r\n  violated his Fourth Amendment rights.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  Fourth Amendment guarantees a person the right to be secure from unreasonable\r\n  searches and seizures. Â U.S. Const. amend. IV; State v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 201, 539 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 2000). Â â€œ[T]he Fourth\r\n  Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, including\r\n  seizures that involve only a brief detention.â€ Â State v. Pichardo&nbsp;\r\n  367 S.C. 84, 97, 623 S.E.2d 840, 847&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005). Â A temporary\r\n  detention during an automobile stop, even if only for a brief\r\n  period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a seizure within the meaning of\r\n  the Fourth Amendment. Â State v. Maybank, 352 S.C. 310, 315, 573 S.E.2d\r\n  851, 854 (Ct. App. 2002). Thus, an automobile stop is â€œsubject to the constitutional\r\n  imperative that it not be â€˜unreasonableâ€™ under the circumstances.â€ Â Whren v.\r\n    United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810 (1996). Â When probable cause exists to\r\n  believe a traffic violation has occurred, the decision to stop the automobile\r\n  is reasonable per se.Â  State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 598, 571 S.E.2d\r\n  703, 707&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  police lawfully detain a motor vehicle for a traffic violation, they may order\r\n  the driver to exit the vehicle without violating Fourth Amendment proscriptions\r\n  on unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Id. Â In carrying out the stop, the\r\n  police â€œmay request a driverâ€™s license and vehicle registration, run a computer\r\n  check, and issue a citation.â€ Â United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126,\r\n  131 (4th Cir. 1998) (quoting Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983)). Â Once the\r\n  underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded, any further\r\n  detention for questioning is not automatically unconstitutional. Â Pichardo,\r\n  367 S.C. at 98-99, 623 S.E.2d at 847-48.Â  An investigative detention must be\r\n  temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the\r\n  stop and the scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to its\r\n  underlying justification. Â Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500 (1983). Â Once the purpose of that stop has been fulfilled, the continued\r\n  detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a second detention. Â Williams,\r\n  351 at 598-99, 571 S.E.2d at 707-08. Â \r\nLengthening\r\n  a detention once an initial stop is completed is permissible in two situations:\r\n  (1) the officer has an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion illegal\r\n  activity has occurred or is occurring; or (2) the initial detention has become\r\n  a consensual encounter.Â  Â Â Pichardo,\r\n  367 S.C. at 99, 623 S.E.2d at 847-48 (quoting United States v. Hunnicutt,\r\n  135 F.3d 1345, 1349 (10th Cir. 1998)). Â Thus, anÂ  â€œofficerâ€™s continued\r\n  questioning of a vehicleâ€™s driver and passenger outside the scope of a valid\r\n  traffic stop passes muster under the Fourth Amendment either when the officer\r\n  has a reasonable articulable suspicion of other illegal activity or when the\r\n  valid traffic stop has become a consensual encounter.â€Â  Id. Â \r\nThe\r\n  term â€œreasonable suspicionâ€ requires a particularized and objective basis that\r\n  would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity. Â State v. Woodruff,\r\n  344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 2001). Â In determining whether\r\n  reasonable suspicion exists, the whole picture must be considered. Â United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 8 (1989). Â The burden is on the State to articulate\r\n  facts sufficient to support reasonable suspicion. Â State v. Butler, 343 S.C. at 202, 539 S.E.2d at 416.\r\nWe\r\n  find the traffic stop ended when Colegrove issued the warning and returned\r\n  Tindallâ€™s license. Â Therefore, Tindall was detained after the conclusion of the\r\n  traffic stop.Â  The State argues the detention was consensual.Â  We need not\r\n  determine if the detention was consensual because we find Colegrove had an objectively\r\n  reasonable articulable suspicion illegal activity had occurred or was occurring.Â  \r\nColegrove\r\n  testified he further detained Tindall because he believed something illegal was\r\n  occurring based on Tindallâ€™s actions after the stop.Â  Colegrove observed\r\n  numerous things after the stop including:Â  1) Tindall was nervous even after\r\n  receiving the warning; 2) Tindall was driving a rental car that he had not\r\n  rented; 3) Tindall was driving only one way and then dropping the car off; 4)\r\n  Tindall planned on driving approximately eighteen hours in one day; and, 5) the\r\n  cities involved were both â€œdrug hubs.â€Â  We find evidence in the record to\r\n  support a determination that Colegrove had a reasonable suspicion something\r\n  illegal was occurring.Â  Therefore, the search and seizure did not violate\r\n  Tindallâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights and the trial court did not err in admitting\r\n  the cocaine.Â  \r\nII.Â  Suppression of Statement \r\nTindall argues the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting his statement because it was obtained as a\r\n  result of the alleged violation of the Fourth Amendment.Â  We disagree.Â  Although Tindallâ€™s Brief references Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the\r\n  argument solely concerns the legality of the search.Â  Because we find the\r\n  search legal, as previously discussed, the trial court did not err in admitting\r\n  the statement.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Third-Party Guilt\r\nTindall\r\n  maintains the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the issue of\r\n  third-party guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court is required to charge the law as determined from the evidence\r\n  presented at trial.Â  State v. Gates, 269 S.C. 557, 561, 238 S.E.2d 680, 681 (1977).Â  If any evidence supports a charge, it should be given.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  A trial courtâ€™s refusal to\r\n  give a requested charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to warrant\r\n  reversal.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261,\r\n  565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002).Â  â€œFailure to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial error where the instructions given afford the\r\n  proper test for determining the issues.â€Â  Id. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at\r\n  304.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the recent decisions of State v. Rice[2] and State v. Swafford[3],\r\n  this Court reiterated that the rule for admitting third-party guilt in South\r\n  Carolina is found in State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532\r\n  (1941).Â  The rule states:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[E]vidence\r\n  offered by [an] accused as to the commission of the crime by another person\r\n  must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt, and to\r\n  such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own\r\n  innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare\r\n  suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the\r\n  commission of the crime by another, is not admissible . . . . [B]efore such\r\n  testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such\r\n  a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other\r\n  person as the guilty party.\r\n\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d at 534-35 (internal\r\n  citations omitted).Â  The Gregory rule â€œand its analogues in other\r\n  jurisdictionsâ€ require the trial court to â€œfocus the trial on the central\r\n  issues by excluding evidence that has only a very weak logical connection to\r\n  the central issues.â€Â  Rice, 375 S.C. at 320, 652 S.E.2d at 418.Â  â€œ[T]he Gregory rule [also] requires the trial judge to consider the probative value or the\r\n  potential adverse effects of admitting proffered third-party guilt evidence.â€Â  Swafford,\r\n  375 S.C. at 641, 654 S.E.2d at 299.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  these third-party guilt cases revolve around the admission of evidence of third-party guilt, Tindall appeals the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s failure to charge the jury on third-party guilt.Â  The evidence\r\n  at trial indirectly implicating a third party included Tindallâ€™s testimony that\r\n  he took possession of the rental vehicle when â€œ[i]t was left in the driveway of\r\n  [his] homeâ€ the day before his trip and the fact that he did not rent the\r\n  vehicle.Â  The trial court found it had not â€œheard any testimony in particular\r\n  blaming a third party.â€Â  The evidence that someone other than Tindall placed\r\n  the drugs in the car raised merely a conjectural inference at best and we find\r\n  no error by trial court based on State v. Gregory.Â  \r\n\r\n\tFurthermore, the trial court charged the jury on mere\r\n  presence, stating:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNow, to prove possession in\r\n  this case, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\r\n  had both the power and the intent to control the disposition or use of the\r\n  cocaine.Â  Possession may be either actual or constructive.Â  Actual possession\r\n  means that the cocaine was in the actual physical custody of the defendant.Â  Constructive\r\n  possession means that the defendant had dominion and control or the right to\r\n  exercise dominion or control over any of the cocaine itself or the property in\r\n  which the cocaine was found.\r\n\t\tMere presence at the scene\r\n  where the drugs were found is not enough to prove possession.Â  Actual knowledge\r\n  of the presence of the cocaine is strong evidence of the defendantâ€™s intent to\r\n  control its disposition or use.Â  The defendantâ€™s knowledge and possession may\r\n  be inferred when a substance is found on the property under the defendantâ€™s\r\n  control.Â  However, the inference is simply an evidentiary fact to be taken into\r\n  consideration by you along with other evidence in the case and to be given the\r\n  weight you decide it should have.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find this charge adequately charged\r\n  the law as determined from the evidence presented at trial. See Gates, 269 S.C. at 561, 238 S.E.2d at 681 (finding trial court required to charge the law as determined from the\r\n  evidence presented at trial).Â  Accordingly, because the\r\n  charge given provided the proper law for the jury to consider given the\r\n  evidence presented, the trial court did not err in failing to give the\r\n  requested charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Tindall testified it took seven hours to get from Hampton to Durham and then over two hours to get from Durham to Wilmington. \r\n[2]&nbsp; 375 S.C. 302, 652 S.E.2d 409&nbsp;(Ct.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General David E. Spencer, all of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J.:Â  Wiesart appeals the trial courtâ€™s ruling that S.C. Code Ann. Â§23-3-430(14) (Supp. 2007) is not retroactive.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1979, a Maryland court convicted Wiesart\r\n  of indecent exposure after he was caught skinny-dipping with his girlfriend in\r\n  a hotel pool.Â  Fifteen years later, Wiesart pled guilty in Horry County to a controlled substance offense.Â  He received probation.Â  Wiesartâ€™s probation\r\n  agent informed him that he was required to register under the sex offender registry\r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430 (Supp. 1995) because of the\r\n  prior indecent exposure conviction.\r\nPrior\r\n  to 1996, S.C. Code Â§Â§ 23-3-430 and 23-3-460 required any person\r\n  convicted of indecent exposure to register annually[1] as a sex offender.Â  In 1996, the\r\n  statute was amended to include a person convicted of indecent exposure only â€œif\r\n  the court makes a specific finding on the record based on the circumstances of\r\n  the case the convicted person should register as a sex offender.â€[2]Â  \r\nOn January\r\n  9, 2006, upon learning of the amendment, Wiesart brought a declaratory judgment\r\n  action in the trial court.Â  He argued he was entitled to a hearing on the issue\r\n  of whether he was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Â§ 23-3-430, as amended.Â  The trial court ruled against Wiesart,\r\n  finding the statute was not retroactive.Â  Wiesart appeals. \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nWiesart\r\n  argues the amendment to Â§ 23-3-430 is retroactive because it is\r\n  procedural or remedial in nature.Â  We agree.[3]\r\nGenerally, â€œstatutory enactments are to be considered prospective\r\n  rather than retroactive in their operation unless there is a specific provision\r\n  in the enactment or clear legislative intent to the contrary.â€[4]Â  Statutes that are remedial or procedural in nature, however, operate retroactively.[5]Â  A statute is remedial and applies retroactively when it creates new\r\n  remedies for existing rights or enlarges rights of persons under disability.[6] Â \r\nHere,\r\n  the 1996 amendment to Â§ 23-3-430 is procedural in nature.Â  As set forth above,\r\n  the amendment creates a requirement that the trial court make a specific\r\n  finding on the record regarding whether a person convicted of indecent exposure\r\n  should register as a sex offender.Â  The amendment does not create a new right.Â \r\n  Instead, it sets forth a procedure for determining whether a person convicted\r\n  of indecent exposure is required to register on the sex offender registry.  [7]Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the registration requirement renews itself on a recurring basis.Â  We take note\r\n  of the fact that the Legislature was aware of this recurring obligation when it\r\n  passed the amendment to the statute regarding the necessary findings for\r\n  registration. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In 2006, S.C. Code Â§23-3-460 (Supp. 2006) was\r\n  amended to require bi-annual registration. \r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(14) (Supp. 2006).\r\n[3] We are aware of Hazel v. State, Op. No. 26448\r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 10, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.

James, of Easley, for the Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â Patsy\r\n  Gail Nicholson (Mother) and her adult son Kyle Allan Nicholson (Kyle) initiated\r\n  this action against F. Allan Nicholson (Father) seeking Fatherâ€™s payment of\r\n  Kyleâ€™s college expenses pursuant to a separation agreement.Â  Father appeals the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order in favor of Mother and Kyle.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMother and Father married in March 1978, separated\r\n  in October 1992, and later divorced.Â  They had two children, Kyle being the\r\n  youngest.Â  A separation agreement entitled â€œComplete Property, Support,\r\n  Custody, and Separation Agreementâ€ (the Agreement) was approved by the family\r\n  court and made part of the Order Approving Separation.Â  The Agreement provided:\r\n\r\n\t3-OTHER\r\n  BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN\r\n\tThe Husband presently owns ____ shares of stock in Duke Power\r\n  Company, as a result of his employment.Â  The Husband agrees to use the proceeds\r\n  from the sale of the stocks for the minor childrenâ€™s educational needs, first\r\n  and foremost, or to other necessities for the children as a need may arise.Â \r\n  Notwithstanding his continued employment at Duke Power Company or his\r\n  termination from employment, the Husband agrees to provide for the minor\r\n  children in an amount equivalent to the value of 1,200 shares of the Duke Power\r\n  Stock at its present value of 36,000.\r\n\r\nKyle graduated\r\n  from high school in May 2006 with a grade point average of 3.4 and ranked\r\n  thirty-eighth in a class of one hundred fifteen.Â  He received awards in art\r\n  during his junior and senior years.Â  His career ambitions focused on the design\r\n  field with special interests in automotive design or architecture.Â  In\r\n  September 2006, he enrolled at Tri-County Technical College majoring in\r\n  University Transfer hoping to later attend Clemson University or another school\r\n  offering design programs.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  still in high school, Kyle was diagnosed with depression and placed on\r\n  medication.Â  During his first semester at the technical college, he explained\r\n  to the court his depression was worsened by the stress of not knowing where he\r\n  would live or if he would have the money to continue his education.Â  His anxiety\r\n  grew to the point where â€œeveryday was kind of a struggleâ€ and, following a\r\n  suicide attempt and hospitalization, he withdrew from school.Â  Kyle did not\r\n  take his prescribed medication properly, used marijuana prior to his\r\n  hospitalization, and tried cocaine one time.Â  At the time of the hearing, Kyle\r\n  remained in counseling and found it beneficial.Â  He no longer uses illegal\r\n  drugs and his prescribed medicine has been adjusted with positive results.Â \r\n  Kyle returned to Tri-County Technical College the spring semester following his\r\n  withdrawal.\r\nIn his\r\n  financial declaration, Kyle indicated he intended to participate in a\r\n  work-study program expecting to earn $309 per month.Â  His tuition was covered\r\n  by financial aid, federal Pell grants, and a Life Scholarship requiring he\r\n  maintain a 3.0 grade point average and complete a certain number of credits.Â  \r\nKyle used a car, but it was not in his name. Â Because Mother had\r\n  totaled her vehicle and was moving from the area, she would take the car Kyle\r\n  had been driving.Â  Among the expenses Kyle submitted were auto related costs of\r\n  $250 per month and automobile payments of $300 per month.Â  On a monthly basis,\r\n  Kyle estimated he needed $200 for food and household supplies, $200 for\r\n  utilities, $30 for his medical co-payment, and $100 for computer and internet supplies.Â \r\n  Overall, his monthly expenses were $1620.Â  Additionally, he listed a $4000 debt\r\n  owed to a family friend for money borrowed by Mother on Kyleâ€™s behalf to pay\r\n  the actionâ€™s attorney fees. \r\nThe\r\n  family court judge found the â€œOther Benefits for Childrenâ€ clause ambiguous. Â The\r\n  testimony of Mother and Father was received on the issue of intent.Â  Father\r\n  testified he earns $72,000 per year as an employee of Duke Energy, where he has\r\n  worked for twenty five years.Â  The Duke Energy stock referenced in the Agreement\r\n  began as a stock benefit account but later changed to a 401(k).Â  At the time of\r\n  the hearing, the stock had split and was worth approximately $60,000.Â  He\r\n  explained the disposition of the stock at the time Mother and Father entered\r\n  the Agreement:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\t[W]as that part of the equitable\r\n  division of marital property with [Mother], your ex-wife?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tYeah, that was set aside yes, to help pay for \r\n\t\t\tthings, educational things, or things that they needed, as they grew \r\n\t\t\tup from the time we separated.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; So in lieu of her taking a percentage \r\n\t\t\tof stock, yâ€™all were essentially holding it in trust for your kids; \r\n\t\t\tis that right?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tWe set aside that amount to help with the kids.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFather stated he did not understand â€œeducational needsâ€ as used in\r\n  the Agreement to be college.Â  His understanding of â€œother necessities for\r\n  childrenâ€ included â€œ[c]lothes, things they need in school, food when they donâ€™t\r\n  have money for food, powerâ€¦.â€ Â \r\nFather presented\r\n  the family court with a list of miscellaneous expenditures made on behalf of\r\n  the children in years past.Â  The list, admittedly prepared for the purpose of\r\n  the hearing, included such items as trips to the beach and amusement parks,\r\n  musical instruments, a Play Station, and a go-cart.Â  Father argued these were\r\n  â€œother necessitiesâ€ and asserted his $36,000 obligation should be set off\r\n  accordingly.Â  He admitted he never communicated to Mother or Kyle that the\r\n  expenses were to be counted towards the shares of stock he owned.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  was currently seeking disability due to temporal arthritis and collagen\r\n  vascular disease. Â She had been residing with her aging parents in North Carolina, returned to South Carolina to help Kyle after his emotional problems intensified,\r\n  and planned to return to her parentsâ€™ home.Â  She testified the Agreement provided\r\n  for the childrenâ€™s college education.\r\nThe family court judge ruled: the Agreement was ambiguous but (1)\r\n  the intent was to include college expenses as indicated by the testimony of\r\n  Mother and Father; (2) â€œother necessitiesâ€ was intended to include living\r\n  expenses incident to college; (3) Father agreed to pay up to $36,000, the\r\n  stockâ€™s value at the time of the Agreement; (4) the older child did not seek\r\n  benefits under the Agreement; and (5) the Agreement contained no requirement\r\n  the children mitigate expenses or work. Â \r\n\r\n\tThe order mandated:\r\n\tDefendant/father shall pay directly to Kyle Nicholson the sum of\r\n  $800.00 per month for the months of January through May 2007 and for the months\r\n  of September through December 2007, yet equating to nine (9) months a year.Â \r\n  The Defendant/father shall do the same for next year.Â  Kyle Nicholson shall\r\n  provide proof to his father that he is continuously enrolled full time to\r\n  obtain the money.\r\n\t[A]fter Kyle Nicholsonâ€™s two (2) years at Tri-County Technical College, there shall be a balance left from the agreement in the amount of $21,600.00\r\n  for his last two (2) years of college, or eighteen (18) months for a sum of\r\n  $1,200 per month.\r\n\tKyle Nicholson shall be required to exhaust all grants and\r\n  scholarships, but shall not be required to incur loans or minimize expenses.\r\n\tKyle Nicholson shall provide a print-out to his father of his\r\n  tuition, room and board, books, and his grants and scholarships.\r\n\t$400.00 transportation expenses shall be included in the tuition,\r\n  room and board, and books.Â  The room and board expenses shall not exceed the\r\n  cost to live on campus with room and board and full meal plan.\r\n\t[T]he Defendant/fatherâ€™s obligation shall forever end if Kyle\r\n  Nicholson is not continuously enrolled full time, except if he has a medical\r\n  withdrawal unrelated to substance abuse.Â  Kyle Nicholson shall not use illegal\r\n  drugs and the Defendant/father shall have full discovery on that issue.\r\n\t[T]he Defendant/father shall pay attorneyâ€™s fees directly to\r\n  Plaintiffâ€™s attorney in the amount of $2000â€¦.\r\n\tKyle Nicholson is not entitled to assistance under Risinger v.\r\n  Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 253 S.E.2d 652 (1979).\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the evidence.

Â Â Father acknowledges in his brief\r\n  that the family court did not specifically state Kyle had characteristics\r\n  indicating he would benefit from college.Â  Rather, he contends the asseveration\r\n  is â€œimplicit in its order.â€ Â In the pleadings, Mother and Kyle alleged that\r\n  Kyle demonstrated the ability to do well at college, would benefit, and has or\r\n  would apply for grants and scholarships.Â  In response to this paragraph, Father\r\n  denied the allegations claiming to be without sufficient knowledge to form a\r\n  belief and demanding strict proof.Â  Nonetheless, Father testified to Kyleâ€™s\r\n  aptitude:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; Do you agree with me, that your son has \r\n\t\t\tthe ability to do well in school?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tVery much so.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDo you think college would benefit him?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI do.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; Do you want him, to do well?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI do, Iâ€™ve encouraged it.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Father conceded if Kyle was struggling with\r\n  depression and using drugs like marijuana, â€œsome of the best curesâ€ were a\r\n  stable education and gaining a better life.Â  Fatherâ€™s motion to reconsider\r\n  focused solely on the grounds the family court failed to adequately consider\r\n  the Agreementâ€™s ambiguity and the intentions of the parties.Â  \r\nFather relies on Risinger v. Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 253\r\n  S.E.2d 652 (1979), where our supreme court articulated a non-exclusive list of\r\n  circumstances under which a family court may order a parent to pay for a childâ€™s\r\n  college education.Â  The Risinger court held:\r\n\r\n\t[A] family court may require a parent to contribute that amount of\r\n  money necessary to enable a child over 18 to attend high school and four years\r\n  of college, where, as here, there is evidence that: (1) the characteristics of\r\n  the child indicate that he or she will benefit from college; (2) the child\r\n  demonstrates the ability to do well, or at least make satisfactory grades; (3)\r\n  the child cannot otherwise go to school; and (4) the parent has the financial\r\n  ability to help pay for such an education.\r\n\r\nId. at 39, 253 S.E.2d at 653-54.Â  However,\r\n  the family court judge explicitly stated Kyle was not entitled to assistance\r\n  under Risinger.Â  Instead, the judge cited Lacke v. Lacke, 362\r\n  S.C. 302, 608 S.E.2d 147 (Ct. App. 2005), in ruling that Kyle â€œshall be\r\n  required to exhaust all grants and scholarships, but under [Lacke] Kyle\r\n  Nicholson is not required to incur loans or minimize expenses.â€Â  \r\nIn Lacke, an agreement in a divorce decree required both\r\n  parents to pay for the childrenâ€™s â€œcollege education,â€ a term found ambiguous\r\n  as to which expenses were included.Â  This court ruled when a parent voluntarily\r\n  enters an agreement to assume a childâ€™s college education, the child has no\r\n  obligation to minimize expenses, take on student loans, or contribute their own\r\n  income unless the agreement so provides.Â  Id. at 314, 608 S.E.2d at 153.Â \r\n  We explicated Lacke was â€œgoverned by the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â \r\n  Consequently, Risinger â€¦ [was] inapplicable.Â  Pursuant to Risinger,\r\n  the family court may order a parent to pay for a childâ€™s education where no\r\n    agreement to pay exists.â€Â  Lacke, 362 S.C. at 313, 608 S.E.2d at 153\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  As in Lacke, this controversy is governed by the Agreement\r\n  and, thus, the Risinger analysis is inapplicable.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorney\r\n  Fees\r\nFather\r\n  contends the family court erred in awarding attorney fees to Mother and Kyle.Â \r\n  Specifically, Father argues the award should be reversed because the family\r\n  court failed to explain its reasoning and consider the appropriate factors.Â  Counsel\r\n  for Mother and Kyle submitted an affidavit requesting attorney fees of $4220\r\n  plus costs and fees totaling $235.Â  The family court judge ordered Father to\r\n  pay $2000, stating at the hearing, â€œI find that [Father] presented credible\r\n  evidence of his attempts to resolve this without litigation, and his offers of\r\n  support.Â  I also believe Kyle should take some responsibility for where he\r\n  finds himself.â€Â  The final order merely offered, â€œI find that Defendant/father\r\n  was credible on his attempts to resolve some issues with his son.â€ Â Although\r\n  the family court does not fully articulate its reasoning or contemplate the\r\n  related factors, this error does not necessitate reversal.Â  \r\nAttorney\r\n  fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in family court.Â \r\n  S.C.

Â â€œIn deciding whether to\r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider:Â  (1) the partiesâ€™\r\n  ability to pay; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the\r\n  respective financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect of the fee\r\n  on each partyâ€™s standard of living.â€Â  Lacke, 362 S.C. at 317, 608 S.E.2d\r\n  at 154 (citing E.D.M. v.

App. 1999).\r\nThrough\r\n  this courtâ€™s plenary powers of review, we find the decision to award attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees is supported by the record.Â  Neither Mother nor Kyle had the ability to\r\n  pay the fee to bring this action without borrowing money from a friend.Â  Their\r\n  counsel obtained beneficial results.Â  Whereas Father has been with his employer\r\n  for many years and was currently earning $72,000 per year, Mother and Kyle were\r\n  unemployed.Â  Mother was seeking disability and Father admitted Kyleâ€™s school attendance\r\n  would inhibit his ability to work.Â  Â Â Given Motherâ€™s and Kyleâ€™s strained\r\n  financial circumstances, the effect of owing the full attorney fees would more\r\n  adversely affect their standard of living than it would Fatherâ€™s as a result of\r\n  his required $2000 contribution.Â  \r\nThe attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fee affidavit specifically called the family courtâ€™s attention to the Glasscock factors:\r\n\r\n\t4.&nbsp; [Counsel] incorporates herein\r\n  Rule 407 of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules which contains the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct and further calls the attention of the Court to the\r\n  holding of Glasscock v. Glasscock, 403 S.E.2d 313 (S.C. 1991),\r\n  concerning the factors and criteria which should be considered in the setting\r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  He relies upon the discretion of the Court in the\r\n  determination of the amount of fees, based, among other things, upon the\r\n  Courtâ€™s file, the Courtâ€™s knowledge of the litigation between the parties,\r\n  which reflects the difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily\r\n  expended, the result accomplished, the fact that there is no contingency of\r\n  compensation in a domestic relations case, the professional standing of\r\n  counsel, and fees customarily charged in this area for similar legal services.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn the\r\n  case at bar, where the controversy was based on an alleged ambiguity in the Agreement,\r\n  the partiesâ€™ testimony regarding intent was the centerpiece of its resolution.Â \r\n  The affidavit stated counsel for Mother and Kyle spent 21.10 hours preparing\r\n  the pleadings and affidavits and readying for the hearing.Â  Counsel provided he\r\n  was admitted to the South Carolina Bar ten years earlier and had since been in\r\n  private practice.Â  Concerning his professional standing, he was an active\r\n  member of the state bar and other professional legal associations.Â  Contingency\r\n  of compensation was not applicable in this domestic action.Â  Mother and Kyleâ€™s\r\n  counsel secured beneficial results for his clients.Â  Although no indication of\r\n  customary legal fees for similar services appears, the record sufficiently\r\n  supports the Glasscock factors.Â  Accordingly, $2000 is a reasonable\r\n  award, and we find no abuse of discretion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Agreement is enforceable and was intended to provide for the\r\n  childrenâ€™s educational needs and other necessities.Â  Under the circumstances of\r\n  this case, transportation is a necessity enabling Kyle to attend classes.Â  We rule\r\n  Father must pay Kyle the sum of $800 per month, including transportation\r\n  expenses of $400, for the months of January through May 2007 and September\r\n  through December 2007, equating to nine months per year.Â  Father shall do the\r\n  same for 2008.Â  After Kyleâ€™s first two years of college, Father shall apply the\r\n  $21,600 balance towards Kyleâ€™s last two years, or eighteen months at a sum of\r\n  $1200 per month. Â Father is not entitled to a credit towards the $36,000 he\r\n  owes.Â  The record provides ample evidence to support the award of attorney fees.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4405","title":"Swicegood v.

Jahue Moore, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Â Sheriff\r\n  Leon Lott, in his official capacity as Sheriff of Richland County, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s failure to grant\r\n  his motions for directed verdict and judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), as well as his post-trial motions for a new\r\n  trial absolute and new trial nisi. &nbsp;We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department (Department) was conducting an\r\n  investigation on a former deputy, Brian Gailey, based on allegations of\r\n  criminal activity.Â  The Department became convinced then-current deputy Shawn Swicegood\r\n  had information on Gailey because the two were friends and former co-workers.Â  Upon\r\n  arriving at work on February 28, 2003, Swicegood was taken into the office of\r\n  Chief Investigator David Wilson for questioning.Â  Swicegood repeatedly denied having\r\n  any knowledge of Gaileyâ€™s alleged illegal activity. Â \r\nWilson did not\r\n  believe Swicegood, asking him if he would submit to a polygraph examination. Â Swicegood\r\n  agreed, and ultimately was administered three polygraph exams, which the\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department believed indicated Swicegood had not told the truth.Â  In\r\n  preparation for the polygraph, Swicegood told the examiner he was in possession\r\n  of an unauthorized assault rifle which he had built from scrap metal pieces.Â \r\n  The Department contacted the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and\r\n  federal weapons charges were initiated against Swicegood, to which he\r\n  ultimately pled guilty and served eighteen months in federal prison.Â  \r\nOn the same day,\r\n  and after Swicegoodâ€™s interrogation had begun, Department Captain James Stewart,\r\n  at Wilsonâ€™s direction, began looking into the hours Swicegood had reported on\r\n  his Department timesheet.Â  Specifically, Stewart was directed to compare\r\n  Swicegoodâ€™s reported hours as a deputy, against the hours Swicegood had\r\n  reported participating in the Departmentâ€™s Special Duty Program.Â  The program,\r\n  also known as moonlighting, was encouraged by the Department as an opportunity\r\n  for deputies to find extra work to supplement their incomes. Â Swicegood\r\n  participated in the moonlighting program, including providing security at a\r\n  Cash-O-Matic location.Â  Stewartâ€™s investigation ultimately yielded three\r\n  instances where Swicegoodâ€™s security moonlighting overlapped with hours he had\r\n  submitted to the Department for his deputy duties.[1]Â \r\n  These instances were for fifteen minutes each, and because Stewart believed\r\n  this represented a pattern, he did not approach Swicegood in order to allow him\r\n  a chance to explain the discrepancies.Â  Instead, Stewart went to a magistrate\r\n  and swore out three warrants for Swicegoodâ€™s arrest for obtaining signature or\r\n  property by false pretenses.Â  \r\nThe three warrants were\r\n  then given to Wilson to serve on Swicegood during the still ongoing interrogation.Â \r\n  Throughout the interrogation, Wilson stated he would make both the state and\r\n  federal charges â€œgo awayâ€ if Swicegood would give the information that the\r\n  Department wanted on Gailey.Â  When Swicegood refused to perjure himself, he was\r\n  arrested, and spent approximately the next eighteen hours in jail.Â  By the time\r\n  Swicegood posted bail, reports of his arrest and charges had been given by the\r\n  Department to The State newspaper, other news agencies, and were posted on the\r\n  internet.Â  \r\nSwicegood brought an action for false arrest,\r\n  malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and negligence against Lott in his\r\n  official capacity. Â On summary judgment motion, the circuit court dismissed\r\n  Stewart as a defendant, and dismissed all causes of action against Lott except\r\n  for the abuse of process claim.Â  A jury trial was held only on the abuse of\r\n  process action which resulted in a $150,000 jury verdict in favor of\r\n  Swicegood.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV,\r\n  the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that\r\n  reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\r\n  opposing the motions and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields\r\n  more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€ Â Law v. S.C. Dept. of\r\n    Corrections, 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006). Â An appellate\r\n  court will only Â reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a JNOV motion when there\r\n  is no evidence to support the ruling or where\r\n  it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. at 434-35, 629 S.E.2d at 648 \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Sovereign Immunity\r\n  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(17)\r\nLott contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying his motions for a directed verdict and judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on the grounds that he is entitled to sovereign\r\n  immunity pursuant to an exception of the general waiver of immunity under the\r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act.[2]Â \r\n  Specifically, Lott maintains an action for abuse of process necessarily\r\n  involves alleging elements of actual malice and intent to harm, for which he\r\n  would be entitled to immunity as a matter of law under Section 15-78-60(17) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe tort of abuse\r\n  of process consists of two elements:Â  an ulterior purpose, and a willful act in\r\n  the use of the process that is not proper in the regular conduct of the\r\n  proceeding.Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Int'l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 492\r\n  S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997).Â  In explaining the elements of abuse of process, the\r\n  circuit court charged the jury that Swicegood must prove by a greater weight or\r\n  preponderance of the evidence that Lott â€œhad some ulterior purpose or bad\r\n  intent.â€Â  Additionally, in explaining the second element of the tort, the\r\n  circuit court explained â€œit is the malicious misuse or perversion of the\r\n  process for a result thatâ€™s not legitimate for its purpose that constitutes an\r\n  abuse of process.â€ \r\nSection 15-78-60(17)\r\n  provides:Â  â€œThe governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from . .\r\n  . (17) employee conduct outside the scope of his official duties or which constitutes actual fraud, actual malice, intent to\r\n    harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.â€ (emphasis added).Â  Thus, Lott\r\n  contends, the preceding jury charge necessarily involves a finding of both\r\n  malicious conduct sufficient to rise to the level of actual malice, and intent\r\n  to harm.Â  As stated above, the tort of abuse of process contains neither an\r\n  element of intent to harm, nor actual malice.Â  Although harm may result from\r\n  the â€œbad intentâ€ used by the circuit court to describe an ulterior purpose,\r\n  proving an abuse of process claim does not require a party to intend such\r\n  harm.Â  See Eldeco, Inc. v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 372 S.C.\r\n  470, 481, 642 S.E.2d 726, 732 (2007) (finding the comparable torts of tortious\r\n  interference with contractual relations, and intentional interference with\r\n  prospective contractual relations do not contain an intent to harm element\r\n  providing immunity under Â§ 15-78-60(17)).Â  \r\nSimilarly, there is\r\n  no required element of actual malice.Â  Actual malice in this situation refers\r\n  to common law actual malice, and has been defined by situations where â€œdefendant\r\n  was actuated by ill will in what he did, with the design to causelessly and\r\n  wantonly injure the plaintiff.â€Â  Jones v. Garner, 250 S.C. 479, 488, 158\r\n  S.E.2d 909, 914 (1968); see also Hubbard and Felix, The South\r\n  Carolina Law of Torts, p. 398.Â  The improper purpose element of an abuse of\r\n  process claim usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral\r\n  advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself.Â  Therefore, it is\r\n  the use of the process to coerce or extort that is the abuse, and need not be\r\n  accompanied by any ill will.Â  As the tort of abuse of process does not require\r\n  a finding of actual malice or intent to harm, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  denying Lottâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV as to his immunity under Â§\r\n  15-78-60(17).\r\nII. Arrest Warrants\r\n  Carried To Their Authorized Conclusion\r\nLott\r\n  next contends the circuit court erred in failing to grant his motions for\r\n  directed verdict and JNOV because the process had been carried to its\r\n  authorized conclusion.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; \r\nLott\r\n  maintains that because the arrest warrants obtained by Stewart for the alleged\r\n  double-dipping were carried to their authorized conclusion, i.e., Swicegood was\r\n  taken to trial and the charges were ultimately dismissed, then there should be\r\n  no liability for the tort of abuse of process.&nbsp; This logic is\r\n  misplaced.&nbsp; Lott relies upon the isolated statement in Guider v.\r\n    Churpeyes, Inc. that â€œ[r]egardless, there is no liability\r\n  when the process has been carried out to its authorized conclusion, even though\r\n  with bad intentions.â€&nbsp; 370 S.C. 424, 432, 635 S.E.2d 562, 566 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (emphasis added).&nbsp; However, this statement should not be interpreted\r\n  to mean that no liability may ever arise where the process is carried to its\r\n  authorized conclusion.Â  &nbsp; Indeed, the essence of the tort of abuse of\r\n  process centers on events occurring outside of the process, namely:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  improper purpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral\r\n  advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the\r\n  surrender of property or the payment of money, by the use of the process as a\r\n  threat or club. There is, in other words, a form of extortion, and it is what\r\n  is done in the course of negotiation, rather than the issuance or any formal\r\n  use of the process itself, which constitutes the tort.\r\n\r\nHuggins v. Winn-Dixie\r\n  Greenville, Inc., 249 S.C. 206, 209,\r\n  153 S.E.2d 693, 694 (1967) (citation omitted).&nbsp; The existence of probable\r\n  cause for the double-dipping arrest warrants is not in dispute.&nbsp;\r\n  Nonetheless, there is clearly evidence in the record the Department initiated\r\n  the investigation into Swicegoodâ€™s moonlighting with the intent of coercing him\r\n  into implicating Gailey. Â The â€œwillful actâ€ element of the abuse of process\r\n  tort has been interpreted by this court to consist of three different\r\n  components:Â  1) an act that is either willful or overt; 2) in the use of the\r\n  process; 3) that is ultimately reprehensible because it is either (a) unauthorized\r\n  or (b) aimed at an illegitimate collateral objective.Â  Food Lion, Inc. v.\r\n    United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 351 S.C.65, 71, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The evidence before us is sufficient to\r\n  create a jury question as to both the ulterior purpose element and all three\r\n  aspects comprising the willful act element.&nbsp; \r\nOur decision that a jury issue was created on the peculiar facts of this case\r\n  should not be interpreted to chill law enforcement activity in its legitimate\r\n  procurement of cooperation to further investigations.&nbsp; The eliciting of\r\n  cooperation from an accused in one case in exchange for leniency with existing\r\n  charges, where the accused genuinely has information that would benefit law\r\n  enforcement, does not, and never has fallen within the tort of abuse of\r\n  process.&nbsp; Here, however, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Swicegood, as we must for the purposes of evaluating this issue at the directed\r\n  verdict and JNOV stage, the evidence is susceptible to the inference that the\r\n  primary purpose of the investigation and issuance of warrants was to coerce or\r\n  extort Swicegoodâ€™s testimony against Gailey, even though he had previously\r\n  indicated he had no knowledge that would further the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  investigation.Â  Thus the facts of this case are distinguished from normal\r\n  police investigative procedure.Â  As a result, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  denying Lottâ€™s motions on this issue.\r\nIII. Causal Connection\r\n  Between the Abuse of Process and Damages \r\nLott\r\n  next contends the circuit court erred in denying his motions for directed\r\n  verdict and JNOV because Swicegood failed to prove the causal connection\r\n  between the alleged misuse of the process and his claimed damages.Â  He\r\n  maintains that under abuse of process, recoverable damages are only those\r\n  resulting from the misuse of the process, but not those losses resulting from\r\n  the proper use of the process.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has addressed the issue of damages in an abuse of\r\n  process action in the second Huggins case to come before the court after\r\n  remand and appeal.Â  It provides an appropriate explanation of the damages\r\n  recoverable from an abuse of process claim.Â  Huggins v. Winn-Dixie\r\n    Greenville, Inc., 252 S.C. 353, 166 S.E.2d 297 (1969).Â  The court concluded\r\n  â€œ[d]amages recoverable for abuse of process are compensatory for the natural\r\n  results of the wrong, and may include recompense for physical or mental injury;\r\n  expenses; loss of time; and injury to business, property or financial standing.â€Â  Id. at 362, 166 S.E.2d at 301 (citation omitted).Â  In finding that\r\n  once abuse of process is proven, damages are recoverable, the court went on to explain\r\n  that â€œthere may be recovery without proof for harm to the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  reputation, standing and credit,â€ as well â€œas to humiliation and other mental\r\n  suffering or injury to [a personâ€™s] feelings.â€Â  Id. at 363, 166 S.E.2d\r\n  at 301 (citation omitted). Moreover, if some damage to the reputation could be\r\n  considered a natural and probable consequence of the abuse of process, then\r\n  submission to the jury is proper, even if there was no proof as to the damage.Â  Id.Â  Swicegood testified as to the frustration, embarrassment, and\r\n  humiliation he experienced having to face his family, friends and members of\r\n  his church, after his arrest had been leaked to the press.Â  We find this to be\r\n  sufficient evidence to support the submission of damages to the jury. \r\nIV. New Trial; New Trial Nisi Remittitur\r\nLott next contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in failing to grant his post-trial motion for a new trial\r\n  absolute.Â  We disagree.\r\nA circuit court may\r\n  grant a new trial absolute on the ground that the verdict is excessive or\r\n  inadequate.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 379, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805\r\n  (1993).Â  The circuit court should grant a new trial absolute on the\r\n  excessiveness of the verdict only if the amount is so grossly inadequate or\r\n  excessive as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the\r\n  figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality,\r\n  corruption or some other improper motives.Â  Id. at 379-80, 426 S.E.2d at\r\n  805.Â  \r\nThe grant or denial\r\n  of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the circuit court, and its\r\n  decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless its findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence, or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\n  of law.Â  Umhoefer v. Bollinger, 298 S.C. 221, 224, 379 S.E.2d 296, 297\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œIn deciding whether to assess error to a courtâ€™s denial of a\r\n  motion for a new trial, we must consider the testimony and reasonable\r\n  inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.â€Â  Id.\r\nLott first\r\n  maintains the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a new trial\r\n  absolute because the juryâ€™s charge, which defined ulterior purpose as â€œbad\r\n  intent,â€ was incorrect and confusing to the jury.Â  Lott failed to lodge an\r\n  objection at the close of the jury charge.Â  Only after the jury requested to be\r\n  re-charged on the law of abuse of process and ulterior motive did counsel take\r\n  exception to the charge.Â  See Lundy v. Lititz Mut. Ins. Co., 232\r\n  S.C. 1, 10, 100 S.E.2d 544, 548 (1957) (finding an objection was waived as\r\n  untimely, where counsel did not object at the conclusion of the main charge,\r\n  but later objected to additional instructions that were substantially the same\r\n  as the main charge).Â  \r\nLott next contends\r\n  the circuit court erred because of the excessiveness of the verdict.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  Swicegood lost his job, and testified as to the humiliation he felt\r\n  amongst his family, friends and church members as a result of this process,\r\n  and, as noted above, this is evidence of compensable damages for an abuse of\r\n  process claim.Â  The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding the\r\n  award of $150,000 was neither so excessive as to shock the conscience, nor the\r\n  result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruption or some other\r\n  improper motives.Â  \r\nFinally, Lott\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in failing to grant his motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Although Lott claims to have made a nisi motion, and that it was denied by the circuit court, a review of the record\r\n  before us finds no motion for a new trial nisi.Â  As a result, this issue\r\n  is unpreserved for our review.Â  See Peterson v. Richland County,\r\n  335 S.C. 135, 515 S.E.2d 553 (Ct. App. 1999) (although brief indicated that a\r\n  motion to reconsider was filed and denied, neither the motion nor the order\r\n  were in the record on appeal).\r\n\r\n  We hold the circuit court did not err in failing to grant Lottâ€™s motions for\r\n  directed verdict and JNOV, or his\r\n  post-trial motions for a new trial absolute and new trial nisi.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\nPIEPER, J., and GOOLSBY,\r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Based on Swicegoodâ€™s annual wage at the time, each\r\n  alleged instance amounted to $3.75 of â€œdouble-dipping.â€Â  Additionally,\r\n  testimony indicates it was common practice to fill out timesheets with expected\r\n  hours at the beginning of each month, before actually working the hours.Â  \r\n[2] S.C.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for\r\n    Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Â Â Lance Lyles (Lyles)\r\n  appeals his convictions for murder, attempted first degree burglary, attempted\r\n  armed robbery, and possession of a pistol by a person under the age of\r\n  twenty-one.Â  Lyles contends that the circuit court erred by excluding the\r\n  proffered testimony of two defense witnesses because the exclusion constituted\r\n  an abuse of discretion by denying Lyles his due process right to present witnesses\r\n  in his own defense.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  December 8, 2004, two men approached the apartment of Clarence Spicer (Spicer)\r\n  in Spartanburg, South Carolina.Â  At the time, Spicer, known as â€œSeeâ€ or â€œC.â€,\r\n  and the victim, Tavaris Howze (Howze), were the only people inside the\r\n  apartment.Â  Spicer recounted the events:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[T]wo guys came up to my door, one of\r\n  them with a mask and a gun and the other with a hood covering his face.\r\n\tI opened the door and saw that.Â  One of\r\n  the guys tried to step in.Â  I stopped him on his way in.Â  The other guy came\r\n  from the side with a gun and a mask on, and I started trying to close the\r\n  door.Â  And while I was closing the door one of them shot inside of my house,\r\n  and thatâ€™s when [Howze] was shot.\r\n\r\nSpicer\r\n  called 911 and waited for the authorities.Â  Upon their arrival, police officers\r\n  discovered Howzeâ€™s body in the apartment with a gunshot wound to the head.Â  Howze\r\n  died from his injuries.Â  \r\nAt the time of the shooting, Spicer did\r\n  not recognize either of the men.Â  However, he later recalled the identity of\r\n  the individual in the hood as Lance Lyles because Lyles had visited Spicerâ€™s\r\n  apartment several weeks beforehand.Â  Spicer relayed Lylesâ€™ identity to the\r\n  police and an arrest warrant was issued.Â  Police officers then approached Lyles\r\n  and a chase ensued.Â  He was subsequently apprehended and arrested.Â  Spicer was\r\n  able to identify Lyles as one of the assailants from a photographic lineup and\r\n  again at trial.Â  Following the arrest, police searched Lylesâ€™ residence and discovered\r\n  multiple rounds of ammunition in various sizes, several shell casings, and a\r\n  jacket containing a ski mask.Â  \r\nSeveral\r\n  days after Lylesâ€™ arrest, Joshua Jeter (Jeter) was arrested as Lylesâ€™\r\n  accomplice to the crimes.Â  Jeter indicated he and Lyles had been outside of\r\n  Spicerâ€™s apartment on the night of the incident and Jeter was wearing a ski\r\n  mask.Â  However, Jeter did not admit he was carrying a firearm at the scene\r\n  until making another statement almost a year after his arrest.Â  In the latter\r\n  statement, Jeter conceded he carried a pistol to the apartment but claimed it\r\n  was a different caliber than the weapon that killed Howze.\r\nBoth\r\n  Lyles and Jeter were indicted for several offenses including murder, burglary\r\n  in the first degree, armed robbery, and unlawful possession of a pistol by a\r\n  person under the age of twenty-one.Â  At trial, both individuals testified in\r\n  their own defense.Â  Lyles and Jeter gave conflicting accounts of the incident\r\n  with each inculpating the other as the shooter.Â  However, each corroborated\r\n  they had originally gone to the apartment to purchase drugs from Spicer and had\r\n  no intention of robbing him.\r\nBoth\r\n  men were convicted of murder, attempted burglary in the first degree, attempted\r\n  armed robbery, and unlawful possession of a pistol by a person under the age of\r\n  twenty-one.Â  Lyles was sentenced to life for murder and other consecutive\r\n  sentences for the lesser offenses.Â Â Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid trial judge\r\n  err in excluding testimony as unfairly prejudicial and irrelevant when the\r\n  proffered statements went to establishing (1) drugs were previously sold from\r\n  the apartment where the incident occurred and (2) drugs were present in the\r\n  apartment at the time of the incident?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v.

State, 350 S.C. 465, 472, 567 S.E.2d 847, 851 (2002)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ  Â \r\nLyles avers the exclusion of testimony\r\n  regarding prior drug sale solicitations at the apartment where the shooting\r\n  occurred and the presence of drugs next to the victim constituted an abuse of\r\n  discretion by the trial judge and was a denial of his due process rights.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nA.Â \r\n  How the Issue was Raised\r\nAt the nascency\r\n  of trial, the State anticipated the attorneys for both Lyles and Jeter were\r\n  planning to address alleged drug use at Spicerâ€™s apartment.Â  In response, the\r\n  State made a motion in limine for the court to exclude any comments\r\n  regarding drug use or the existence of drugs at the apartment and to preclude\r\n  any questions related to this subject matter.Â  The trial judge agreed to limit\r\n  opening statements by barring any reference to drug use or presence.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the judge required the defense to establish the relevancy of any drug evidence\r\n  before the topic could be introduced at trial.Â  \r\nAt the outset of the defenseâ€™s case, Jeter\r\n  and Lyles proffered the testimony of an individual (Neighbor) who lived in the\r\n  apartment next door to Spicer at and before the time of the incident.Â  Outside\r\n  the presence of the jury, Neighbor testified an individual called C.C.\r\n  attempted to sell drugs to him and a friend as they approached Neighborâ€™s\r\n  apartment. This solicitation occurred several months preceding the shooting.Â  Neighbor\r\n  further stated C.C. stayed in the apartment rented by Spicer but did not know\r\n  if C.C. lived there.Â  Neighbor failed to identify Spicer as C.C. when asked if\r\n  C.C. was present in the courtroom. \r\nThe\r\n  State objected and the trial judge conducted an inquiry to determine the\r\n  relevance of the testimony.Â  Defense counsel for Jeter argued the testimony\r\n  established drugs were being sold out of Spicerâ€™s apartment and bolstered the\r\n  credibility of Lyles and Jeter by supporting their claim they went to the\r\n  apartment to purchase drugs.Â  The trial judge excluded the testimony after\r\n  making the following determination:\r\n\r\n\tWell, I think I understand the purpose\r\n  for which it is offered, but I find that itâ€™s not -- it is certainly\r\n  prejudicial as to the state.Â  And whatever probative value might result is\r\n  clearly outweighed by that prejudicial effect, not to mention the fact that I\r\n  donâ€™t find it to be relevant in any fashion in this case.\r\n\r\nLater in the\r\n  defenseâ€™s case, Lyles and Jeter attempted to introduce an expert who planned to\r\n  testify that a partially-smoked cigarette found in the apartment contained\r\n  marijuana.Â  The State objected.Â  The trial judge sustained the objection after\r\n  determining the evidence was irrelevant because no drugs other than the\r\n  partially-smoked cigarette were found at the scene.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Relevancy of Evidence\r\nLyles maintains\r\n  the exclusion of the testimony was an abuse of discretion.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Evidence offer guidance on the admissibility of proffered\r\n  testimony.Â  Hamilton, 344 S.C. at 357, 543 S.E.2d at 593.Â  â€œ â€˜Relevant\r\n  evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œAll\r\n  relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the\r\n  Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of South\r\n  Carolina, statutes, [the rules of evidence], or by other rules promulgated by\r\n  the Supreme Court of South Carolina.â€Â  Rule 402, SCRE.Â  â€œEvidence which is not\r\n  relevant is not admissible.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\n  cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  â€œRules 401 and 403, SCRE, are identical\r\n  to their federal counterparts and consistent with South Carolina common law.â€Â  Hamilton , 344 S.C. at 357, 543 S.E.2d at 593 (citing Rules 401 &amp; 403, SCRE\r\n  (advisory committeeâ€™s notes)).Â  â€œRule 402, SCRE, is identical to the federal\r\n  rule, except as amended to reference South Carolina law.â€Â  Hamilton, 344\r\n  S.C. at 357, 543 S.E.2d at 593 (citing Rule 402, SCRE (advisory committeeâ€™s\r\n  note)).\r\nOnly\r\n  evidence found to be relevant should be admitted.Â  Hamilton, 344 at 353,\r\n  543 S.E.2d at 591.Â  â€œUnder Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has a direct\r\n  bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in\r\n  controversy.â€Â  Preslar, 364 S.C. at 476, 613 S.E.2d at 386 (citing In\r\n    re Care and Treatment of Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 205, 577 S.E.2d 451, 453\r\n  (2003); Adams, 354 S.C. at 378, 580 S.E.2d at 794); accord State\r\n    v.

Â We review a trial court's\r\n  decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and\r\n  are obligated to give great deference to the trial court's judgment.

Â A trial judge's\r\n  balancing decision under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate court believes\r\n  it would have decided the matter otherwise because of a differing view of the\r\n  highly subjective factors of the probative value or the prejudice presented by\r\n  the evidence. Â United States v. Long, 574 F.2d 761 (3d Cir. 1978).\r\n  Â If judicial self-restraint is ever desirable, it is when a Rule 403 analysis\r\n  of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal. Â Id.\r\n\r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the\r\n  relevancy of evidence should only be overturned for a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Aleksey, 343 S.C. at 35, 538 S.E.2d at 256; Alexander,\r\n  303 S.C. at 380, 401 S.E.2d at 148; Jeffcoat, 279 S.C. at 170, 303\r\n  S.E.2d at 857.Â  In Rish v. Rish, 296 S.C. 14, 15-16, 370 S.E.2d 102, 103\r\n  (Ct. App. 1988), this Court enunciated what constitutes an abuse of discretion:\r\n\r\n\tIt is not always easy to determine when\r\n  and if a trial judge has abused his discretion.Â  Overly simplified, abuse of\r\n  discretion involves the extent of disagreement.Â  When an appellate court is in\r\n  agreement with a discretionary ruling or is only mildly in disagreement, it\r\n  says that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion.Â  On the other hand,\r\n  when the appellate court is in substantial or violent disagreement, it says\r\n  that there has been an abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, the evidence presented by Lyles was properly\r\n  excluded.Â  The trial judge correctly found no probative link between the\r\n  proffered testimony and the pending charges.Â  Lyles was on trial for murder,\r\n  burglary in the first degree, armed robbery, and unlawful possession of a\r\n  pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one.Â  The testimony put forth by the\r\n  defense, if accepted, would have established drugs were offered for sale\r\n  outside of the apartment several months before the shooting by an individual\r\n  known only as C.C. whose true identity remains unknown to the court.Â  Additionally,\r\n  there was evidence that a small quantity of partially-smoked marijuana was\r\n  found near the victim.Â  Lyles professes this evidence shows that he and Jeter\r\n  were truthful in their assertions of venturing to the apartment to purchase\r\n  drugs.Â  Defense counsel argued this went directly to the credibility of Lyles\r\n  and Jeter.Â  Nevertheless, these contentions miss the mark.Â  Even if factual, the\r\n  testimony does not serve as a defense to any of the offenses charged in this\r\n  case nor does it excuse or mitigate Lylesâ€™ actions.Â  It is not probative of any\r\n  issue material to reaching a verdict.Â  This absence of a logical connection to\r\n  the facts in debate makes the evidence irrelevant and inadmissible.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  even if the testimony were relevant to the controversy, the trial judge\r\n  correctly ruled it was inadmissible as unfairly prejudicial. Â The evidence is\r\n  prejudicial because it stands to suggest a decision on an improper basis.Â  By potentially\r\n  insinuating a key witness for the State is a drug dealer and drugs were present\r\n  next to the victim, the testimony could unfairly impugn the character of Spicer\r\n  and Howze and cloud the issues.Â  The risk of confusion or misdirection requires\r\n  an analysis under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Given the tenuous probative link, the prejudicial\r\n  effect outweighs any value the evidence may hold.Â  Moreover, we are obligated\r\n  to give great deference to the decision of the trial judge in this matter and\r\n  should only reverse in exceptional circumstances when there is a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  After a thorough review of the record, we find no abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  There is no error of law in the trial judgeâ€™s discretionary ruling.\r\n  Â The details of the present case do not warrant reversal.Â  \r\nC.Â \r\n  Right to Present a Defense\r\nLyles\r\n  contends the exclusion of the testimony deprived Lyles of his due process right\r\n  to present witnesses in his own defense.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Constitution of the United States guarantees a criminal defendant certain fundamental rights.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  â€œThe Sixth Amendment rights to notice, confrontation, and\r\n  compulsory process guarantee that a criminal charge may be answered through the\r\n  calling and interrogation of favorable witnesses, the cross-examination of\r\n  adverse witnesses, and the orderly\r\n  introduction of evidence.â€Â  State v.

XIV; Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403-404 (1965) (holding the\r\n  Sixth Amendment applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment); Mizzell,\r\n  349 S.C. at 330, 563 S.E.2d at 317 (â€œThe Sixth Amendment is applicable to the\r\n  states through the Fourteenth Amendment.â€).\r\nOur Stateâ€™s Constitution and legislature\r\n  have further ensured individuals accused of a crime will enjoy these rights.Â \r\n  The Constitution of the State of South Carolina asseverates:\r\n\r\n\tThe right of trial by jury shall be\r\n  preserved inviolate. Â Any person charged with an offense shall enjoy the right\r\n  to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury; to be fully informed of the\r\n  nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against\r\n  him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to be\r\n  fully heard in his defense by himself or by his counsel or by both.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Const. art. 1, Â§ 14; see also S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 3 (due process\r\n  rights).Â Â  Additionally, the South Carolina Code confirms these guarantees by\r\n  allowing criminal defendants to compel witnesses to appear in their favor and\r\n  to produce witnesses and evidence at trial.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-23-60 (1976); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-7-60 (1976).Â  These safeguards ensure the\r\n  accused will benefit from a fair and impartial trial.Â Â  \r\nâ€œFew\r\n  rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his\r\n  own defense.â€Â  Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302 (1973); see\r\n    also California v.

Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967), the United States Supreme Court elucidated the rights of an accused to\r\n  present testimony:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe right to offer the testimony of\r\n  witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the\r\n  right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant's version of the\r\n  facts as well as the prosecution's to the jury so it may decide where the truth\r\n  lies. Â Just as an accused has the right to confront the prosecution's witnesses\r\n  for the purpose of challenging their testimony, he has the right to present his\r\n  own witnesses to establish a defense. Â This right is a fundamental element of\r\n  due process of law. Â \r\n\r\nHowever, â€œ[i]n the exercise of this\r\n  right [to present a defense], the accused, as is required of the State, must\r\n  comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both\r\n  fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.â€Â  Chambers,\r\n  410 U.S. at 302.Â  â€œThe right to present a defense is not unlimited, but must â€˜\r\n  â€˜bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.â€™\r\n  â€™ â€Â  Hamilton, 344 S.C. at 359, 543 S.E.2d at 594 (quoting Rock v.\r\n    Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 55 (1987) (quoting Chambers, 410 U.S. at 295)).Â  â€œ â€˜The accused does not have an unfettered right to offer [evidence] that\r\n  is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of\r\n  evidence.â€™ â€ Montana v.

The\r\n  Development Services Counter is the key point of public contact for the\r\n  planning and zoning functions of the County.Â  It is the primary information\r\n    resource of property owners and land use professionals who often need to know\r\n    â€˜What can and can not be done with a piece of property.â€™â€ (emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â  \r\nAccordingly, in January 2003, Broker met with the Richland County\r\n  Planning Department staff (Staff) to obtain the zoning classification and\r\n  permitted uses for the parcel. Â Countyâ€™s subdivision coordinator, Carl Gosline,\r\n  told Broker the parcel was zoned RU (rural), a classification that permits a\r\n  manufactured-home subdivision. Â Additionally, County tax records listed the\r\n  parcelâ€™s zoning as RU. \r\nOn\r\n  March 13, 2003, Buyer purchased the parcel and then surveyed, platted, and\r\n  prepared it for development.Â  In September, Buyer filed an application with the\r\n  County Planning Commission for site plan approval for his proposed subdivision.\r\n  Â Buyerâ€™s site plan requested subdividing the parcel into twenty lots for\r\n  manufactured homes.Â  The Staff Report to the Planning Commission recommended\r\n  approval of Buyerâ€™s subdivision plan and included the following findings: (1) the\r\n  parcel was zoned RU, (2) the proposed projectâ€™s impact on traffic was well within\r\n  design capacity for the access road, (3) the proposed project was compatible\r\n  with adjacent development, and (4) the project implemented objectives of the\r\n  North Central Subarea Plan, including varied and low-density development\r\n  initiatives.Â  On October 6, 2003, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to\r\n  approve Buyerâ€™s subdivision application and site plan. Â Thereafter, Buyer began\r\n  marketing and selling lots for Brockington Acres.Â  \r\nOver a year later, after the first manufactured homes were already\r\n  installed, community members contacted their county council representative and\r\n  asked him to attend a neighborhood meeting at a church adjoining Brockington\r\n  Acres.Â  Countyâ€™s current zoning\r\n  administrator, Geonard Price, accompanied\r\n  the council member to the meeting, where neighbors inquired about zoning\r\n  restrictions and expressed opposition to the development of Brockington Acres.Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2004, Staff notified Buyer that Price had interpreted the official\r\n  zoning map and found the parcel was zoned RS-1, a classification that prohibits\r\n  manufactured homes.[1]Â \r\n  Three days later, Price issued an order requiring Buyer to cease development of\r\n  the subdivision.Â  \r\nOn November 17, 2004, County issued its\r\n  order stopping further development; however, since receiving final site plan\r\n  approval from the Planning Commission in October 2003, Buyer had already sold\r\n  five of the subdivisionâ€™s twenty lots.Â  Two purchasers had obtained County permits\r\n  authorizing them to install manufactured homes and, in fact, two homes were already\r\n  installed on the lots. Â Another purchaser had permits to install manufactured homes\r\n  on three lots, but had not yet installed them when the County issued its order\r\n  to cease development. Â \r\nWhen Buyer contacted Staff about Countyâ€™s order to cease\r\n  development at Brockington Acres,Â  Staff told him to apply to county council\r\n  for a zoning map amendment and assured him it would recommend approval of his\r\n  request.Â  However, just two weeks later, the Staff Report recommended the\r\n  Planning Commission deny Buyerâ€™s application for a zoning map amendment.\r\n  Â At a meeting on December 2, 2004, the Planning Commission accepted the Staff\r\n  Report and recommended county council deny Buyerâ€™s request for a zoning map amendment.\r\n  Â Thereafter, county council voted unanimously to deny Buyerâ€™s application to\r\n  amend the zoning map. \r\nBuyer filed a complaint in circuit court requesting\r\n  an injunction and alleging causes of action against County for equitable\r\n  estoppel, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and inverse condemnation.Â  Buyer\r\n  sought an order requiring County to change zoning of his parcel from\r\n  RS-1 to RU. Â Alternatively, Buyer sought damages and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  County\r\n  moved for summary judgment, which the circuit court granted.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment, this court applies the same standard that\r\n  governed the trial court; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860\r\n  (2002); see also Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œOn appeal from an order\r\n  granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities,\r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most\r\n  favorable to the appellant, the non-moving party below.â€Â  Willis v. Wu,\r\n  362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Validity of Zoning\r\n  Ordinances\r\nInitially Buyer\r\n  contends there is a material issue of fact as to whether County validly enacted\r\n  its 1978 zoning ordinances.Â  We agree with the circuit court that Buyer is\r\n  statutorily barred from challenging the validity of the zoning ordinance at\r\n  this juncture.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  took County thirteen months to provide the minutes from the county council\r\n  meetings in 1978 wherein the zoning on the subject property was purportedly\r\n  granted.Â  While Buyer asserts certain irregularities in connection with the\r\n  approval of the zoning ordinances, the circuit court correctly held that Buyer\r\n  may not now be heard to challenge the validity of the enactment of the\r\n  ordinances.Â  Section 6-29-760(D) of the South Carolina Code (2004) provides: \r\n\r\n\tNo challenge to the adequacy of notice or challenge to the\r\n  validity of a regulation or map, or amendment to it, whether enacted before or\r\n  after the effective date of this section, may be made sixty days after the\r\n  decision of the governing body if there has been substantial compliance with\r\n  the notice requirement of this section or with established procedures of the\r\n  governing authority or the planning commission. \r\n\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find Buyerâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\nII. Inverse Condemnation\r\nBuyer next alleges\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of County on his\r\n  claim for inverse condemnation.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nAn inverse condemnation may result from the\r\n  governmentâ€™s physical appropriation of private property, or it may result from\r\n  government-imposed limitations on the use of private property.Â  Byrd v. City\r\n    of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2005).Â  To prevail in\r\n  an action for inverse condemnation, â€œa plaintiff must prove an affirmative,\r\n  aggressive, and positive act by the government entity that caused the alleged\r\n  damage to the plaintiff's property.â€ Â WRB Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. County of Lexington, 369 S.C. 30, 32, 630 S.E.2d 479, 481 (2006).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found there was â€œno evidence that the zoning designation [of Buyerâ€™s parcel]\r\n  was changed, and at most, any representation of the zoning designation of the\r\n  property by Mr. Gosline or contained in the Tax Assessorâ€™s records was a\r\n  mistake.â€Â  This finding is in line with Buyerâ€™s own complaint, which stated\r\n  â€œthe staff represented to [Buyer] that it had erroneously advised [Buyer] that\r\n  the subject property was zoned â€œRUâ€ and that records in the development staff\r\n  offices and Tax Assessorâ€™s office differed from the official zoning map.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Buyer puts forth two alternative arguments in support of its assertion\r\n  that the circuit court erred in granting Countyâ€™s motion for summary judgment\r\n  on the inverse condemnation claim.Â  First, Buyer contends there has never been\r\n  a valid, enforceable zoning map and that therefore, it was denied the ability\r\n  to develop the property as it desired without being subject to zoning\r\n  restrictions.Â  As discussed above, because Section 6-29-760(D) bars Buyerâ€™s\r\n  challenge, this contention is without merit. Next, Buyer contends\r\n  that Countyâ€™s action in informing it the zoning of the property was RU\r\n  constituted a sufficient showing of an affirmative, aggressive, and positive\r\n  act to establish inverse condemnation.Â  \r\nHowever, the only\r\n  evidence in the record indicates that Countyâ€™s informing Buyer of the zoning\r\n  designation for the property was merely a mistake, caused primarily by incorrect\r\n  record keeping in the tax assessorâ€™s office.Â  We have found no reported case,\r\n  and Buyer has cited none, which holds that a mistake may rise to the level of\r\n  an affirmative, aggressive, and positive act sufficient to constitute inverse\r\n  condemnation. Â Accordingly, the courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to County on\r\n  this cause of action is affirmed.\r\nÂ III. Negligence and\r\n  Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nBuyer also contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment in favor of County on its claims of negligence and\r\n  negligent misrepresentation.Â  We agree. \r\nThe circuit\r\n  court judge, relying on the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, held that Buyerâ€™s\r\n  tort claims against County were barred by sovereign immunity.Â  Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-40 (2005) states:Â  â€œThe State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a\r\n  governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the\r\n  same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the\r\n  limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and\r\n  damages, contained herein.â€Â  Moreover, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-50(b) (2005)\r\n  provides:Â  â€œIn no case is a governmental entity liable for a tort of an\r\n  employee where that employee, if a private person, would not be liable under\r\n  the laws of this State.â€Â  Thus, the circuit court reasoned, County is liable\r\n  for the negligent administration and enforcement of its zoning ordinances only\r\n  if a private person could also be held liable for breach of that same duty\r\n  under South Carolina law.Â  \r\nWe recognize\r\n  that there is Federal authority which supports the circuit courtâ€™s resolution\r\n  of this issue.Â  See United States v. Olson, 546 U.S. 43 (2005) (holding\r\n  that under a similar provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the United\r\n  States only waives sovereign immunity under circumstances where local law would\r\n  make a private person liable in tort). Â Moreover, the circuit court also relied\r\n  upon a recent decision from this court in granting summary judgment to County\r\n  on these causes of action; however, the case relied upon was recently reversed\r\n  by our supreme court.Â  See Sloan Constr. Co., Inc. v. Southco\r\n    Grassing, Inc., 368 S.C. 523, 629 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 2006), revâ€™d ___ S.C. ___, 659 S.E.2d 158 (2008) (holding that because a private person\r\n  would never be liable for the failure to require bonds mandated under the\r\n  â€œLittle Miller Act,â€ this court found Sloan had no right to sue under the South\r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Actâ€™s limited waiver of sovereign immunity).Â  Thus, no South Carolina precedent exists to support the circuit courtâ€™s determination that it is\r\n  necessary to have a private analogue in order for liability to exist against a\r\n  governmental entity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Therefore, at\r\n  this premature stage of the litigation, we decline to hold that Buyer may not\r\n  pursue its claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation based on these\r\n  provisions of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court also based its decision to grant summary judgment on S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005), which states a governmental entity is not liable for a\r\n  loss resulting from:Â  â€œadoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or\r\n  failure to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but\r\n  not limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule,\r\n  regulation, or written policies . . . .â€Â  We view Buyerâ€™s claims for negligence\r\n  and negligent misrepresentation as arising from Countyâ€™s actions in mistakenly\r\n  advising Buyer on the applicable zoning restrictions on the 72.5 acre parcel,\r\n  not as emanating from the adoption or enforcement of Countyâ€™s zoning\r\n  ordinances; therefore, we disagree with the circuit court that this provision\r\n  of the tort claims act bars Buyerâ€™s claims.Â Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on Buyerâ€™s causes of action for\r\n  negligence and negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nIV. Equitable Estoppel\r\nFinally, Buyer\r\n  contends the circuit court\r\n  erred in granting summary judgment to County on its claim for equitable estoppel.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Buyer argues further inquiry is needed to determine whether County should be estopped from enforcing the RS-1\r\n  zoning determination almost two years after County determined the same parcel\r\n  was zoned RU and a year after it approved Buyerâ€™s site plan.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œ[E]stoppel is an equitable doctrine,\r\n  essentially flexible, and therefore to be applied or denied as equities between\r\n  the parties may preponderate.â€ Â Pitts v. N.Y. Life Ins.\r\n    Co., 247 S.C. 545, 552, 148 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1966).Â  To prevail on a\r\n  claim of equitable estoppel, a party must show: â€œ(1) a lack of knowledge[,] and\r\n  the means of knowledge[,] of truth as to facts in question; (2) justifiable\r\n  reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and (3) prejudicial change in\r\n  the position of the party claiming estoppel.â€ Â Evins v. Richland County Historic Pres. Commâ€™n, 341 S.C. 15, 20, 532 S.E.2d 876, 878 (2000).[2] Â \r\nâ€œThe acts of a\r\n  government agent that are within the proper scope of his authority may give\r\n  rise to estoppel against a municipality.â€ Â Charleston County v. Natâ€™l Adver. Co., 292 S.C. 416, 418, 357 S.E.2d\r\n  9, 10 (1987); see also Landing Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle Beach,\r\n  285 S.C. 216, 221, 329 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1985) (â€œTo allow the city to repudiate\r\n  its former interpretation of permissible rentals and the statements of its\r\n  zoning director, based upon a re-assessment of the meaning of an undefined term\r\n  in the ordinance[,] would be unconscionable.â€).\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; Lack of\r\n  Knowledge\r\nIn granting summary\r\n  judgment to County on Buyerâ€™s claim of equitable estoppel, the circuit court\r\n  found the zoning administratorâ€™s interpretation of the official zoning map was\r\n  conclusive because: â€œRichland County Zoning Ordinances provide that the\r\n  official zoning map of Richland County constitutes the only official description\r\n  of the location of zoning district boundaries, and that the zoning\r\n  administrator is the only representative on behalf of Richland County that can\r\n  interpret the official zoning map.â€Â  However, this finding ignores the clear\r\n  import of the Countyâ€™s website which directs the public to the Development\r\n  Services Counter as â€œthe primary information resource of property owners and\r\n  land use professionals who often need to know â€˜What can and can not be done\r\n  with a piece of property.â€™â€ Moreover, the Frequently Asked Questions portion of\r\n  the website advises the public to check the zoning of a parcel prior to its\r\n  development by consulting with the Department of Development Services, and\r\n  suggests that it is advisable â€œto meet with the Planning Staff to discuss your upcoming\r\n  project.â€Â  Nowhere on the website is it stated that the official zoning map\r\n  must be consulted to determine a propertyâ€™s correct zoning designation.\r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  believe a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Buyer possessed\r\n  the knowledge or the means to acquire the knowledge concerning the true zoning\r\n  of this property.Â  See Abbeville Arms v. City of Abbeville, 273\r\n  S.C. 491, 257 S.E.2d 716 (1979); Landing Dev. Corp., 285 S.C. at 220,\r\n  329 S.E.2d at 425.Â  At trial, both parties will have the opportunity to develop\r\n  evidence on the issue of whether or not the official zoning map in Richland County is the exclusive means for acquiring zoning information.\r\n2.&nbsp; Justifiable\r\n  Reliance\r\nBuyer contends\r\n  there is a question of material fact whether its reliance on the\r\n  representations of County officers and staff, acting within their proper scope\r\n  of authority, was justified.Â  We agree.\r\nAt the zoning\r\n  hearing, Price was asked about Staffâ€™s determination that Buyerâ€™s parcel was\r\n  zoned RU, and the Planning Commissionâ€™s subsequent approval of Buyerâ€™s\r\n  subdivision plan for manufactured housing which was predicated upon RU zoning.Â \r\n  Price admitted: â€œIt was thought to be approvable when we were asked.â€Â  Price\r\n  also conceded subdivision coordinator Gosline told him the parcel was zoned\r\n  RU.Â  Price then reviewed tax cards from the assessorâ€™s office showing the\r\n  parcelâ€™s zoning as RU; however, Price could offer no reason for the\r\n  contradictions of these statements and his later determination the development\r\n  had a classification of RS-1.Â  \r\nBroker\r\n  testified he met with subdivision coordinator Gosline about two months before\r\n  Buyer purchased the parcel.Â  Broker stated it was the common practice for\r\n  brokers to consult Staff to determine a parcelâ€™s zoning classification.Â  He\r\n  also acknowledged that, prior to November 17, 2004, he was unaware County kept\r\n  an official zoning map and had never heard of developers demanding to see it. Additionally,\r\n  Broker testified that Gosline determined the parcel was zoned RU by looking it\r\n  up on his computer.Â  Broker confirmed he later saw a tax bill that showed the\r\n  property was zoned RU.Â  Finally, Broker stated prior to November 17, 2004, all\r\n  County documents referring to the parcel, including Buyerâ€™s recorded\r\n  subdivision plat, showed the parcel was zoned RU.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on all of these assertions, Buyer purchased the parcel, then surveyed, platted\r\n  and prepared it for development.Â  We hold this evidence created a genuine issue\r\n  of material fact as to whether Buyerâ€™s reliance on the representations of\r\n  County officers and staff was justified.\r\n3.&nbsp; Prejudicial\r\n  Change in Position\r\nBuyer\r\n  contends there is a question of material fact whether harm was caused by his\r\n  justifiable reliance on the Countyâ€™s representations.Â  Specifically, he argues\r\n  there was evidence that: (1) after Countyâ€™s Planning Staff determined the\r\n  parcel was zoned RU, which permitted a manufactured home subdivision, Buyer\r\n  purchased the parcel and prepared it for development; (2) after the Planning\r\n  Commission unanimously approved the subdivision plan for Brockington Acres,\r\n  Buyer recorded the plat, marketed the property, and sold lots for twelve months\r\n  without objection; and (3) after County granted permits to purchasers for\r\n  installation ofÂ  their manufactured homes, it notified Buyer the parcel was\r\n  zoned RS-1 and development must cease.[3]Â  \r\nBuyer\r\n  contends that, as a result of his detrimental reliance, the value of his\r\n  property was greatly diminished.Â  Broker testified mobile homes predominate in\r\n  the community encompassing Brockington Acres and lots for â€œstick-built homesâ€\r\n  do not sell as quickly as lots for manufactured-homes.Â  After County\r\n  told Buyer he could not install manufactured-homes on his property, he sold six\r\n  lots at a twenty-percent discount to the church members who had earlier opposed\r\n  his development, losing a substantial amount of interest Buyer would have\r\n  received from self-financing those six lots to the original purchasers.Â  We\r\n  believe these facts clearly demonstrate a question of Buyerâ€™s prejudicial\r\n  change in position.Â  Â Â \r\nUnder the\r\n  standard of review for summary judgment, we find questions of material fact exist\r\n  on each of the elements of Buyerâ€™s cause of action for equitable estoppel.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the courtâ€™s order granting County summary judgment on this cause of\r\n  action is reversed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor\r\n  of County on Buyerâ€™s claims of the existence of a valid zoning ordinance and\r\n  inverse condemnation are affirmed.Â  The grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\n  County on Buyerâ€™s claims of negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and\r\n  equitable estoppel are reversed.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART,\r\n  REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nCURETON, A.J.,\r\n  concurs.Â  PIEPER, J., dissents in a separate  opinion.\r\nPIEPER, J., dissenting:\r\nWhile\r\n  I recognize the facts of the case are troubling, I respectfully dissent.\r\nI do not believe\r\n  that the Tort Claims Act provides a remedy for any negligence or mistake of a\r\n  governmental employee not authorized by statute or ordinance to deviate from a\r\n  zoning ordinance duly passed by the county.Â  The negligence or mistake at issue\r\n  did not involve the exercise of a discretionary act by even the duly authorized\r\n  zoning administrator; instead, the negligent act or mistake at issue was the\r\n  misinterpretation of the official zoning classification by an official other\r\n  than the zoning administrator.Â Â  Moreover, there simply is no indication that\r\n  the zoning administrator or anyone else had the authority to deviate from the\r\n  official zoning classification absent a duly authorized variance.\r\nI am\r\n  also concerned that the opinion may be interpreted as modifying the\r\n  long-standing jurisprudence of this state regarding the application of estoppel\r\n  against a governmental entity by recharacterizing a possible estoppel claim, if\r\n  any, into one for negligence or negligent misrepresentation.Â  United States\r\n  Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once noted that &quot;men must turn\r\n  square corners when they deal with the Government.&quot;Â  Rock Island, A.\r\n    &amp; L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 141, 143 (1920).Â  This case\r\n  indeed presents such a situation and the majority opinion is very compelling as\r\n  to the estoppel issue and the issue of summary judgment.\r\nHowever,\r\n  based upon my interpretation of the law on this issue, I would affirm the\r\n  decision of the circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Record indicates Price was not the Countyâ€™s\r\n  zoning administrator in 2003 when the Planning Commission approved Buyerâ€™s\r\n  subdivision plan.Â  Â Â \r\n[2] We note there appears to be a divergence in our\r\n  stateâ€™s case law as to the number of elements required to prove equitable\r\n  estoppel; however, for the purposes of this appeal, we analyze this claim under\r\n  the three element rubric.Â  See e.g. McCrowey v.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160, the Claimant did not sustain\r\n  an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.\r\n\t2.Â  That the Claimantâ€™s actions deviated outside the course and\r\n  scope of employment by using a company vehicle in an inappropriate and\r\n  unauthorized manner.Â  Boykin v. Prioleau, 255 S.C. 437, 179 S.E.2d 599\r\n  (1971).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court issued an order affirming the appellate panelâ€™s\r\n  denial of benefits.Â  The circuit court denied Claimantâ€™s motion to alter or\r\n  amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â  Does\r\n  substantial evidence support the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Claimant\r\n  allowed an unauthorized person to drive the Employerâ€™s dump truck which\r\n  resulted in an impermissible deviation from his duties?\r\n2.Â \r\n  Did the circuit court and appellate panel commit an error of law in determining Claimant did not sustain an\r\n  injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act governs judicial review of a decision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission. Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n  (1981); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604,\r\n  610 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Pursuant to the APA, an appellate courtâ€™s review is\r\n  limited to deciding whether the full commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Grant v. Grant\r\n    Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 200, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006).\r\nI.&nbsp; Substantial\r\n  Evidence Standard\r\nThe judicial review of the appellate panelâ€™s factual findings is\r\n  governed by the substantial evidence standard.Â  Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368\r\n  S.C. 214, 221, 628 S.E.2d 262, 266 (Ct. App. 2006); Frame v. Resort Servs.,\r\n    Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct.

App.\r\n  2001).Â  The appellate panelâ€™s decision must be affirmed if supported by\r\n  substantial evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C.\r\n  435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Sharpe v. Case\r\n    Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999)).Â  A reviewing\r\n  court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d)(e) (Supp. 2006); see also Hall\r\n    v. United Rentals, Inc., 371 S.C. 69, 77, 636 S.E.2d 876, 881 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006).Â  However, a reviewing\r\n  court may reverse or modify a decision of the appellate panel if the findings,\r\n  inferences, conclusions, or decisions of the panel are â€œclearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(e) (Supp.\r\n  2006); Bass v. Kenco Group,\r\n  366 S.C. 450, 457, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005); Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004), affâ€™d, 369 S.C. 176, 631 S.E.2d 899 (2006).Â  \r\nIt is\r\n  not within the appellate courtâ€™s province to reverse the appellate panelâ€™s\r\n  factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Etheredge\r\n    v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (citing Hoxit v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 405 S.E.2d 407\r\n  (1991)); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 282, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor\r\n  the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action. Â Pratt\r\n    v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004); Jones\r\n      v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 417, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113 (2003); Brown\r\n        v.

App. 1999).Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s\r\n  findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe, 336 S.C.\r\n  at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105; Smith v. NCCI Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 247, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 268, 274 (Ct. App. 2006); DuRant v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 707 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe appellate panel is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™\r\n  compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of\r\n  fact.Â  Isochem, 365 S.C. at 468, 617 S.E.2d at 376; Frame, 357\r\n  S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495; Muir, 336 S.C. at 281, 519 S.E.2d at\r\n  591.Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight assigned to\r\n  the evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â  Shealy v.

Spartan Mills, Startex\r\n    Div., 245 S.C. 265, 140 S.E.2d 173 (1965), our supreme court discussed the\r\n  â€œarising out ofâ€ requirement:\r\n\r\n\tIt (the\r\n  injury) arises â€œout ofâ€ the employment, when there is apparent to the rational\r\n  mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between\r\n  the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the\r\n  resulting injury.Â  Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed\r\n  as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable\r\n  person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned\r\n  by the nature of the employment, then it arises â€œout ofâ€ the employment.Â  But\r\n  it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a\r\n  contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen\r\n  would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.Â  The causative danger\r\n  must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood.Â  It must be\r\n  incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation\r\n  of master and servant.Â  It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after\r\n  the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the\r\n  employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\r\n\r\nId., 245 S.C. at 269, 140 S.E.2d at 175 (quoting Eargle\r\n  v.

Prioleau, 255 S.C. 437, 179 S.E.2d 599 (1971), an employee was assigned\r\n  to take several co-workers home after work.Â  â€œInstead of doing so, he took them\r\n  on an extensive joy ride. During the course of this jaunt some intoxicants were\r\n  consumed while stops were made at two houses, two night clubs and, finally, at\r\n  a restaurant several miles out Farrow Road at about 5:45 A.M.â€Â  Id. at 440, 179 S.E.2d at 600.Â  While the employee was driving back to Columbia to take the co-workers home, the vehicle was involved in a fatal accident.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\tThe supreme\r\n  court articulated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  only reasonable inference from the facts which have been stated is that almost\r\n  immediately upon driving away from his employerâ€™s place of business, Dickerson\r\n  forsook the task assigned to him and embarked upon the pursuit of his own ends.\r\n  It is abundantly clear that while thus engaged he was not conducting his\r\n  employerâ€™s business within the meaning of the [workersâ€™ compensation] statute.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 441, 179 S.E.2d at 600.\r\nThe appellate panel\r\n  correctly applied Boykin to the facts of this case when concluding\r\n  â€œClaimantâ€™s actions deviated outside the course and scope of employment by\r\n  using a company vehicle in an inappropriate and unauthorized manner.â€\r\nIn Brownlee\r\n  v. Wetterau Food Services, 288 S.C. 82, 339 S.E.2d 694 (Ct. App. 1986),\r\n  this Court held that an employee who died in an automobile accident while out\r\n  of town on business was not acting within the scope of and in the course of his\r\n  employment at the time of death.Â  Brownlee, who worked out of the employerâ€™s North Charleston office, was sent to St. Louis, Missouri to attend a training seminar.Â  Id. at 84, 339 S.E.2d at 695.Â  The seminar began each day around 7:00 a.m. and ended\r\n  at 10:00 p.m.Â  Id.Â  Everyone attending the seminar from out of town\r\n  roomed at the motel where all of the seminar activities took place.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  accident occurred at 1:55 a.m., apparently when the employee and several other\r\n  seminar attendees were returning from watching a movie.Â  Id.Â  The movie\r\n  was an outing planned by Brownlee and other attendees after the end of the\r\n  seminarâ€™s daily events.Â  Id.Â  Because the accident occurred some\r\n  distance from the motel and several hours after the last scheduled seminar\r\n  event had ended, we held: â€œthere is substantial evidence Brownlee died while\r\n  engaged in an outing that occurred after work, away from the premises of his\r\n  employer, and at a time when his employer exercised no control over his\r\n  activities.â€Â  Id. at 85, 339 S.E.2d at 695.\r\nThe\r\n  present case can be distinguished from Hall v. Desert Aire, Inc., 376\r\n  S.C. 338, 656 S.E.2d 753 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In Hall, the employee and\r\n  another individual went for a jeep ride after a dinner party where alcohol was\r\n  consumed.Â  Id. at 345, 656 S.E.2d at 756-57.Â  The employer regularly\r\n  paid for entertainment, including alcohol, which was common practice for the\r\n  industry.Â  Id.Â  The evidence indicated that the discussions at the\r\n  dinner party were strictly related to the employerâ€™s business, and the two\r\n  intended on continuing their business discussions in the jeep.Â  Id.Â  The jeep overturned approximately 300 yards from where the ride started,\r\n  wounding Hall and killing the driver.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\tThis\r\n  Court determined:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tPellucidly,\r\n  the evidentiary record exuberates that Hall was engaged in ongoing discussions\r\n  regarding planning for sales activities on behalf of Desert Aire at the time of\r\n  the accident.Â  The accident occurred within the period of employment, at a\r\n  place where Hall was reasonably in the performance of his duties and was\r\n  fulfilling those duties or engaged in activities incidental to that employment.Â \r\n  Like the claimants in Beam, Hall was not exercising a personal privilege\r\n  wholly apart from Desert Aireâ€™s interests.Â  Rather, Hallâ€™s ongoing business\r\n  discussion with Brunner was an act, incidental to and recognized as beneficial\r\n  by Desert Aire in connection with Hallâ€™s duties as national sales manager. . .\r\n  .\r\n\t\tWe hold\r\n  substantial evidence supports the factual finding that Hallâ€™s injury arose out\r\n  of and in the course of employment with Desert Aire, illatively satisfying the\r\n  legal standard for compensability under section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code of Laws.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 360-61, 656 S.E.2d at 764-65 (citing Beam v.\r\n  State Workmenâ€™s Compensation Fund, 261 S.C. 327, 200 S.E.2d 83, (1973)).\r\nThe\r\n  case sub judice differs from Hall, where Hall was advancing his\r\n  employerâ€™s interests by discussing business on the jeep ride.Â  Although the\r\n  parties in the present case dispute whether Claimant was authorized to train\r\n  Brown and allow her to drive the truck, there is substantial evidence to\r\n  support the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Brown was not authorized to drive\r\n  the truck.Â  By allowing Brown to drive, Claimant deviated from the task he was\r\n  assigned to do: haul asphalt from a plant to a road construction site.Â  The\r\n  deviation resulted in an accident that injured him, and thus, Claimantâ€™s\r\n  injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment with Deloach\r\n  &amp; Deloach.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  factual findings of the appellate panel are presumed correct and will only be\r\n  set aside if unsupported by substantial evidence. Rodney v. Michelin Tire\r\n    Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996). We rule there is\r\n  substantial evidence to support the factual finding that allowing Brown to\r\n  drive the dump truck was an impermissible deviation from Claimantâ€™s duties.Â  We\r\n  hold Claimantâ€™s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his\r\n  employment.Â  We place our imprimatur upon the rulings of law by the appellate\r\n  panel and the circuit court.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4409","title":"Sweat v.

Code Section 56-5-4140 contains several sections\r\n  which set forth the weight limits of trucks driving on South Carolina roads\r\n  that are not in the interstate highway system.\r\n\tUnder Section 56-5-4140(1)(a)(2), the general weight\r\n  limit provision, the gross weight for vehicles equipped with three axles is\r\n  46,000 pounds.\r\n\tSeveral exceptions to this general rule for gross\r\n  vehicle weights exist under this statute, however.\r\n\tUnder Section 56-5-4140(1)(b) trucks with three axles\r\n  spaced 32 feet in any consecutive group allow the gross vehicle weight to top\r\n  out at 60,000 pounds.\r\n\tAnother excepted group of trucks appears in Section\r\n  56-5-4140(2)(a).Â  Under this provision, trucks designated and constructed for\r\n  special type workâ€”and the state [sic] has stipulated the City of\r\n    Aiken garbage truck is such a truckâ€”are exempted from any axle spacing\r\n  requirements, are limited to a maximum gross weight of 20,000 pounds per axle \r\n\tplus\r\n    scale tolerances.\r\n\tUnder S.C. Code Section 56-5-4160, scale tolerances\r\n  are set at ten percent.\r\n\tPhotos introduced to Magistrate Neal and this Court\r\n  show the garbage truck to have three axles.Â  A review of the tickets issued to\r\n  Appellants show that the vehicle weights for Sweatâ€™s driving to have been\r\n  15,500 pounds for axle 1 and 41,600 pounds for axle 2 and 3 in total.Â  When\r\n  Bryant drove the truck, it weight [sic] in at 15,300 for axle 1; 21,200 for\r\n  axle 2; and 20,400 for axle 3.\r\n\tAll of these weights were well within the\r\n  statutorily-set maximum weight per axle of 22,000 pounds.Â  \r\n\tThe Stateâ€™s position that only the general provision\r\n  under Section 56-5-4140(1)(a)(2) apply to this truck is misplaced.\r\n\tTo adopt the Stateâ€™s reading of this statute would\r\n  contravene state law of statutory interpretation.Â  When reviewing a statute,\r\n  this Court must follow specific provisions over general language in the\r\n  statute.\r\n\tIn these present cases, applying the specific\r\n  statutory provisions allow for a garbage truck, as a vehicle constructed for a\r\n  special type of work, means it can weigh in at up to 22,000 pounds per axle.Â \r\n  Both Appellants were well within these limits as appears from the uncontraverted\r\n  [sic] evidence in this record.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the order denying the Stateâ€™s motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the circuit court reiterated and further explained the\r\n  reasoning of its prior order:\r\n\r\n\tRespondent has stipulated that the City of Aiken garbage truck driven by these two Appellants is a truck â€œ. . . designed and\r\n  constructed for special type work . . .â€ under the provisions of Section\r\n  56-5-4140(2)(a), S.C. Code Ann. (2005).\r\n\tTrucks subject to this exception to the state gross\r\n  vehicle weight limits are not required to follow the axle spacing requirements\r\n  of 56-5-4140(b).Â  Furthermore, these specially-built trucks also are allowed a\r\n  weight of 20,000 pounds per axle, plus a 10% scale tolerance, not to exceed the\r\n  maximum weight allowed by this section for the appropriate number of axles,\r\n  irrespective of the spacing distance between axles, plus allowable scale\r\n  tolerances.Â  See 56-5-4140(2)(a) and table contained in 56-5-4140(1)(b).\r\n\tIn one instance, this truck driven by Sweat, with a\r\n  single axle under the cab, and a tandem axle under its payload, weighed a total\r\n  of 57,100 pounds [15,500 for the cab axle plus 41,600 lbs for payload axles].Â \r\n  When driven by Arthur Bryant, III, this truck weighed a total of 56,900 pounds\r\n  [15,300 cab axle plus 41,600 for payload axles].Â  In both instances, the truck\r\n  was well below the statutory maximum gross vehicle weight for a three-axle,\r\n  specially built truck under 56-5-4140(2)(a):\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t20,000 lbs for each axle X\r\n      three axles:\r\n\t\t\tPLUS\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t60,000 pounds\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tScale tolerances of 10%\r\n      (56-5-4160(A)):\r\n\t\t\tfor each axle X three axles\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6,000 pounds\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTOTAL ALLOWABLE GROSS\r\n      WEIGHT\r\n\t\t\tFOR THIS SPECIALLY-BUILT\r\n          TRUCK:\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t66,000 pounds\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSection 56-5-4140(2)(a) is the applicable specific\r\n  statutory exception to the general gross weight limits contained in\r\n  56-5-4140(1)(a)(2).Â  Therefore, charging these two drivers with purportedly\r\n  exceeding allowable gross vehicle weights at readings of 57,100 and 56,900\r\n  pounds was improper and their convictions cannot stand.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for\r\n  the court.Â  Univ. of S.

Â§ 56-5-4140 (2006).\r\nSection 56-5-4160(A) states, in part: â€œIn determining\r\n  whether the limits established by Section 56-5-4130 or 56-5-4140 have been\r\n  exceeded, the scaled weights of the gross weight of vehicles and combinations\r\n  of vehicles are considered to be not closer than ten percent to the true gross\r\n  weight, except as otherwise provided in Section 56-5-4140.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-4160(A) (Supp. 2007).\r\nThe\r\n  State has conceded that the drivers were operating â€œtrucks designated and\r\n  constructed for special type workâ€ as defined in subsection (2)(a) of section\r\n  56-5-4140.Â  The only remaining question is how to interpret the language of\r\n  this subsection.Â  It permits special use trucks to weigh 20,000 pounds per axle\r\n  plus the ten percent scale tolerance.Â  This totals 22,000 pounds per axle or\r\n  66,000 total pounds for three-axle vehicles such as the sanitation truck at\r\n  issue here.Â  This is the only reasonable way to interpret this language.\r\nThe\r\n  State focuses on the second part of subsection (2)(a) and argues it\r\n  incorporates the general standard of subsection (1)(a).Â  The Stateâ€™s position\r\n  is incorrect because it would render subsection (2)(a) meaningless.Â  If we\r\n  accepted the Stateâ€™s interpretation, the maximum allowable weight for a\r\n  three-axle vehicle would be 46,000 pounds plus scale tolerances totaling 50,600\r\n  pounds, regardless of the special use exception found in subsection (2)(a).Â  The\r\n  Stateâ€™s interpretation strips the special use vehicle exception of any real\r\n  force or meaning.Â  Under the Stateâ€™s theory, the general rule in (1)(a) would\r\n  always apply and the exception in (2)(a) would be pointless.Â  The General\r\n  Assembly obviously intended the exception to have some efficacy, or the\r\n  legislature would not have enacted it into law.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s interpretation properly honors and harmonizes both\r\n  subsections.Â  Subsection (1)(a) sets the general per-axle standard for vehicles\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Subsection (2)(a) provides a different standard for\r\n  specific types of vehicles when they are not operated on the interstate highway\r\n  system.Â  Subsection (2)(a) does precisely what an exception is intended to do:\r\n  it identifies a category to which the general rule does not apply.Â  The courtâ€™s\r\n  interpretation recognizes the common interplay between general rules and their\r\n  statutorily created exceptions.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State overlooks the fact that subsection (2)(a) carves out an exception that\r\n  applies only to certain specified types of vehicles, but an understanding of\r\n  this point is vital to aÂ  proper reading of the statute.Â  The Stateâ€™s\r\n  interpretation raises the question: why have subsection (2)(a) at all if\r\n  subsection (1)(a) always controls?Â  The answer is that subsection (2)(a) exists\r\n  to create a different weight allowance for â€œtrucks designated and constructed\r\n  for special type work.â€Â  Neither subsection â€œcontrolsâ€ the other.Â  They work\r\n  together to set forth the different standards for regular and special use\r\n  vehicles.Â  This is the only way to harmonize the two subsections and give\r\n  effect to both.Â  Under the rules of statutory interpretation, it was proper and\r\n  indeed necessary for the circuit court to do so.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State focuses on a perceived inconsistency in the use of the words â€œthis\r\n  sectionâ€ in subsection (2)(a).Â  According to the State, the phrase â€œmaximum\r\n  weight allowed by this sectionâ€ can only be a reference back to the general\r\n  standard of subsection (1)(a).Â  We rule that the phrase â€œthis sectionâ€ refers\r\n  to section 56-5-4140 as a whole.Â  This includes subsection (1)(b), which\r\n  presents a formula for increased weight allowances based on the number of axles\r\n  and the distances between them.Â  The maximum allowable weight for a three-axle\r\n  vehicle under subsection (1)(b) is 80,000 total pounds.Â  This is the largest\r\n  allowable weight found anywhere in section 56-5-4140.\r\nWhen\r\n  one reads the phrase â€œthis sectionâ€ in the clause â€œ. . . and the maximum gross\r\n  weight of these vehicles may not exceed the maximum weight allowed by this\r\n  section for the appropriate number of axles, irrespective of the distance\r\n  between axles, plus allowable scale tolerancesâ€ in subsection (2)(a) to refer\r\n  to the entire section of the Code, a clear and consistent meaning emerges.Â \r\n  Special use vehicles can exceed the general rule requirements of subsection\r\n  (1)(a), but the exception in no event allows those vehicles to surpass the\r\n  maximum figures found in subsection (1)(b).Â  The legislature used the\r\n  additional clause in subsection (2)(a) simply to clarify this point.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Stateâ€™s interpretation honors only subsection (1)(a), leaving subsection (2)(a)\r\n  without any force.Â  In affirming the circuit courtâ€™s order, we find all three\r\n  subsections coexist, each serving specific, complementary functions.Â  \r\nHad\r\n  the legislature intended subsection (2)(a) to be an exception only as to tandem\r\n  axle vehicles, as the State advances, the General Assembly could have easily\r\n  included language expressly limiting the nature of the exception contained in\r\n  subsection (2)(a).Â  The statute is lacking any such verbiage.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is true that agencies charged with enforcing statutes usually receive deference\r\n  from the courts as to their interpretation of those laws.Â  Brown v. Bi-Lo,\r\n    Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003).Â  Yet where â€œthe plain\r\n  language of the statute is contrary to the agencyâ€™s interpretation, the Court\r\n  will reject the agencyâ€™s interpretation.â€Â  Id. (citing Brown v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002); Richland\r\n      Co. Sch. Dist. Two v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Educ., 335 S.C. 491, 517 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  In this case, the State is not entitled to any deference in its\r\n  interpretation because the plain language of section 56-5-4140(2)(a) refutes\r\n  the Stateâ€™s position.Â  The circuit court was not bound to accept the Stateâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of the statute.Â  This Court is free to read the statute based on\r\n  its plain language without deference to the Stateâ€™s position.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court properly interpreted section 56-5-4140 based on the clear wording\r\n  of the statute.Â  By its express terms, subsection (2)(a) allows special use\r\n  vehicles like the one involved in these cases to weigh up to 22,000 pounds per\r\n  axle.Â  This is an intentional exception to the general rule of subsection\r\n  (1)(a).Â  Subsection (1)(b), and not the general rule, provides the overall\r\n  maximum weight limitations for special use vehicles.Â  This interpretation\r\n  honors the plain meaning of the statute, and it gives force and effect to all\r\n  the subsections.Â  The Stateâ€™s proposed interpretation, which elevates\r\n  subsection (1)(a) over all others and effectively renders subsection (2)(a)\r\n  meaningless, flies in the face of the plain language of the statute.\r\nIII.Â  Public Policy\r\nThe\r\n  Stateâ€™s claim that the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the statute would\r\n  allow for grossly overweight vehicles is without merit.Â  According to the\r\n  State, reading subsection (2)(a) as allowing up to 22,000 pounds per axle would\r\n  lead to vehicles in excess of 100,000 pounds on South Carolinaâ€™s roads.Â  The\r\n  State has not demonstrated that affirming the circuit court will adversely\r\n  affect the stateâ€™s roads or public safety.Â  The Stateâ€™s argument overlooks\r\n  subsection (1)(b).Â  This subsection establishes a maximum total weight for all\r\n  vehicles, including special use vehicles like the one involved in this case.Â \r\n  The special use exception in subsection (2)(a) references and incorporates the\r\n  statuteâ€™s overall weight limitations.Â  The maximum total weight in subsection\r\n  (1)(b) is 80,000 pounds.Â  With the ten percent scale tolerance, the maximum\r\n  weight of a vehicle on South Carolinaâ€™s roads is 88,000 pounds.Â  This puts to\r\n  rest the Stateâ€™s fears of trucks weighing more than 100,000 pounds on South Carolinaâ€™s roads.Â  The State is able to cite drivers of vehicles over 88,000 pounds\r\n  under the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the statute.\r\nTo\r\n  the extent any policy considerations are implicated, they support the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling.Â  The legislature obviously determined there was a legitimate\r\n  reason to create separate, higher weight allowances for special use vehicles.Â \r\n  One purpose for this special category is to permit larger loads in order to\r\n  limit the trips these vehicles are required to make.Â  The Stateâ€™s\r\n  interpretation would prevent sanitation trucks from hauling full loads and\r\n  require them to make more trips to and from the landfill.Â  This would result in\r\n  increased fuel costs passed on to the taxpayers.Â  The legislature recognized\r\n  that sanitation trucks and other special use vehicles are designed and built to\r\n  handle heavier loads safely to reduce the number of trips per truck.\r\nThere\r\n  is nothing in the statute to indicate the legislature intended to place the\r\n  standard limitations on sanitation trucks and other special use vehicles.Â  The\r\n  existence of the special use exception suggests the legislature wanted to\r\n  achieve the opposite result.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision honors that goal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  position articulated by the State in regard to the body of the statute and the\r\n  exception is quintessential academic statutory colliquefaction.Â  The conflation\r\n  of the base of the statute and the exception emasculates the separate efficacy\r\n  intended by the General Assembly in adding the exception.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4410","title":"Estate of Beatrice Carr v.

Carr\r\n  (Estate) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting the motion for directed\r\n  verdict by Circle S Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Newberry Auto Mart, (the Dealership).\r\n  Â The Estate argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict in\r\n  favor of the Dealership on the following grounds: (1) the motion for a directed\r\n  verdict was improperly postured; (2) the Estate suffered damages as a result of\r\n  the Dealership&#700;s conduct; and (3) there was sufficient\r\n  evidence for submission of the various causes of action to the jury.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn late\r\n  September 2000, Linda Carr (Linda) was in the market to buy an automobile.Â \r\n  Linda, her mother Beatrice Carr (Beatrice), and the rest of her family went to the\r\n  Dealership to purchase a vehicle for Linda.Â  While negotiating for the purchase\r\n  of a 1999 Chrysler Sebring convertible with the Dealershipâ€™s salesman, it was\r\n  brought to Linda and Beatriceâ€™s attention that they would receive a more\r\n  favorable interest rate on their loan if the vehicle was purchased in\r\n  Beatriceâ€™s name as opposed to Lindaâ€™s name. Â Accordingly, Beatrice\r\n  agreed to allow the vehicle to be purchased under her name and signed a retail\r\n  installment contract and security agreement with the financing company, Firstar\r\n  Financial Services (Firstar), for the financing of the vehicle.[1]Â  The amount financed was $15,751.49\r\n  and monthly payments on the loan came to $334.09.Â  Each of the first 41 monthly\r\n  payments included $29.00 to pay for credit life and disability insurance, which\r\n  Linda testified the Dealership required in order for the sale to be completed\r\n  in Beatriceâ€™s name.Â  The total cost of the proposed insurance coverage came to\r\n  $1,543.49. \r\nOn June\r\n  1, 2003, Beatrice, at age eighty-one, passed away.Â  After her motherâ€™s death,\r\n  Linda stopped making the payments on the note under the assumption that the\r\n  credit life insurance would apply and pay off the note.Â  Upon discovering that\r\n  the note had not been paid, Linda contacted the Dealership which, after\r\n  numerous attempts to justify the misapplication of the premiums, eventually informed\r\n  her that Beatrice had been too old to qualify for the insurance; the Dealership\r\n  proceeded as if the coverage had never been purchased. Â The Dealership\r\n  thereafter refunded the insurance premiums plus 6% interest from the date of\r\n  the sale to the Estate.Â  However, at this point, the note was past due and the\r\n  vehicle had been repossessed. \r\nThe\r\n  only beneficiaries under Beatriceâ€™s last will and testament were Lindaâ€™s\r\n  daughter, Deborah S. Carr, and Lindaâ€™s sister, Beatrice Sue Bolton (Mrs.\r\n  Bolton).Â  Mrs. Bolton was the personal representative for the Estate.Â  She\r\n  filed the original inventory and appraisement on February 3, 2005, without\r\n  mention of the 1999 Sebring as an asset of the Estate, the potential civil\r\n  claim against the Dealership, or the debt owed to Firstar/US Bank.Â  Mrs. Bolton\r\n  reopened the Estate in August of 2006, after this claim was filed, to account for\r\n  the action against the Dealership.Â  \r\nThe Estate\r\n  filed a Summons and Complaint on January 18, 2005, alleging breach of contract,\r\n  conversion, negligence, violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices\r\n  Act (hereinafter SCUTPA), and violations of the Regulation of Manufacturers,\r\n  Distributors, and Dealers Act (hereinafter Dealers Act).Â  Ultimately, the case\r\n  was called for trial before a jury on February 5, 2007, in the Newberry County\r\n  Court of Common Pleas.Â  At the close of all evidence, the trial court granted the\r\n  Dealershipâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  The trial judge stated â€œthereâ€™s no\r\n  evidence that the Estate has suffered any loss or has been damaged in any way\r\n  on the specific causes. . . . I also find thereâ€™s insufficient evidence to show\r\n  a violation of the Dealers Act . . . and the same thing with unfair trade practice.â€Â \r\n  This ruling on the record was solemnized by a written form order stating â€œCourt\r\n  Directed Verdict Against Plaintiff.â€Â  The Estate thereafter filed and served\r\n  this notice of appeal on February 26, 2007.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to view\r\n  the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the\r\n  light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and to deny the motion\r\n  when either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in\r\n  doubt.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642,\r\n  648 (2006); Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231,\r\n  236 (2002).Â  However, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative,\r\n  theoretical, or hypothetical views to the jury.Â  Proctor v. Depâ€™t of Health\r\n    &amp; Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 292-93, 628 S.E.2d 496, 503 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006).Â  In essence, the court must determine whether a verdict for the opposing\r\n  party would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in\r\n  his or her favor.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566\r\n  S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002); Proctor at 293, 628 S.E.2d at 503.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  appellate court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict\r\n  motion only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling\r\n  is controlled by an error of law.Â  Law at 434-35, 629 S.E.2d at 648.Â  When\r\n  considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate\r\n  court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the\r\n  testimony or evidence.Â  Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368\r\n  S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFirst,\r\n  the Estate argues that the trial court erred in directing a verdict since a\r\n  motion for a directed verdict was not made by the Dealership at the close of\r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Estate\r\n  claims that because the Dealership only made a motion to dismiss at the close\r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s case, it could not subsequently make a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict at the close of all the evidence. Â The Estate is mischaracterizing the\r\n  motions made by the Dealership.Â  At the close of the plaintiffâ€™s case, the\r\n  Dealership did make a motion to dismiss challenging the Estateâ€™s existence at\r\n  the time the suit was filed.Â  However, immediately thereafter, the Dealership\r\n  asserted its directed verdict motion as to each of the causes of action.Â  The trial\r\n  court entertained the request as a directed verdict motion, despite not\r\n  initially being mentioned by name, and denied the request at that point in the\r\n  trial.Â  At the close of all evidence, the directed verdict motion was\r\n  revisited.Â  The Dealership appropriately referred to the motion by claiming\r\n  entitlement to a directed verdict and the trial judge treated the motion as\r\n  such in his order by directing a verdict against the Estate.Â  Regardless of the\r\n  form in which the request for relief was framed, the substance of the relief\r\n  sought is controlling.Â  Standard Federal Sav. and Loan Assâ€™n v. Mungo,\r\n  306 S.C. 22, 26, 410 S.E.2d 18, 20 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The record is clear that\r\n  throughout the arguments both counsel and the trial judge understood the motion\r\n  being entertained was a motion for a directed verdict.Â  Counsel for the\r\n  Dealership at the close of his final argument stated: â€œwe think that weâ€™re\r\n  entitled to a directed verdict on all causes of action for all the reasons\r\n  stated.â€ Accordingly, the motion was properly before the court and the judge\r\n  appropriately treated the motion as a directed verdict motion. \r\nIn\r\n  addition, the Estate failed to contemporaneously object to the trial court treating\r\n  the motion as one for a directed verdict.Â  Therefore, the matter is not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Â In order to preserve\r\n  an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family\r\n    Ltd. Pâ€™ship., 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt\r\n  is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an\r\n  appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).\r\nAs to the\r\n  remainder of the Estateâ€™s allegations, we must consider whether or not the Estate\r\n  suffered any damage.Â  The trial judge based his ruling primarily on the\r\n  conclusion that the Estate suffered no damage.Â  We respectfully find the court\r\n  erred.Â  \r\nWe first note that it was error for the trial court to conclude\r\n  that the Estate suffered no damage at the directed verdict stage of the trial.Â \r\n  â€œThe failure to list an item in the inventory of an estate is not determinative\r\n  of the title.â€ Gibson v. Belcher, 287 S.C. 315, 318, 338 S.E.2d 330, 332\r\n  (1985) (citing Griffith Admâ€™x. v. Miller, 285 Ky. 675, 149 S.W.2d\r\n  11 (1941)).Â  Furthermore, the president of the Dealership admitted the\r\n  existence of a contract between Beatrice and the Dealership.Â  Beatrice bought\r\n  the vehicle from the Dealership by arranging for financing through Firstar.Â \r\n  Beatrice was therefore the legal owner of the vehicle, although Linda made\r\n  payments on the vehicle.Â  Therefore, under these circumstances, legal title\r\n  would remain in Beatrice but we recognize Linda may arguably have a legal or\r\n  equitable claim because of any payments made.Â  \r\nSince\r\n  Beatrice was the legal owner of the vehicle, her interest passes to her estate\r\n  upon her demise.Â  â€œIt has long been the law in South Carolina that upon the\r\n  testatorâ€™s death, title to the personal property vests in the executor.â€ Belcher,\r\n  287 S.C. at 318, 338 S.E.2d at 332 (citing Lenoir v. Sylvester, 1 Bail.\r\n  632, 17 S.C.L. 632 (1830)).[2]Â \r\n  Therefore, we find the Estate would have benefitted had the insurance been\r\n  obtained and the policy paid, thereby preventing the repossession of the\r\n  vehicle.Â  The loan in Beatriceâ€™s name would have been paid off by those\r\n  proceeds as an obvious benefit to the Estate in its entirety. Â The Estateâ€™s\r\n  legal title would only be subject to Lindaâ€™s equitable or legal interest at\r\n  that point as opposed to also being subject to Firstar/U.S. Bankâ€™s security\r\n  interest.Â Â Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  we find that whether the Dealership is liable for any alleged insurance\r\n  coverage is a question for the jury.Â  If the jury were to find such liability,\r\n  that coverage would be an asset of the Estate.Â  See Moultis v. Degen,\r\n  279 S.C. 1, 7, 301 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1983) (citing In re Miles Estate,\r\n  262 N.C. 647, 138 S.E.2d 487 (1964) (holding that an undistributed insurance\r\n  policy is an asset of the estate)).Â  There is sufficient evidence in the record\r\n  to support the claim that the Dealership was obtaining insurance for Beatrice.Â \r\n  Generally, one who pays insurance premiums is justified in assuming that\r\n  payment will bring immediate protection.Â  Crossley v. State Farm Mut. Auto.\r\n    Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 354, 357, 415 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1992).Â  In the case at\r\n  hand, the insurance premium was paid up front through its inclusion in the\r\n  financing arrangement thereby evidencing an insurance agreement between the\r\n  parties; however, we also recognize the existence of contrary contractual\r\n  language yet cannot resolve these conflicts at the directed verdict stage. The\r\n  terms of the contract included the offer to secure credit life and disability\r\n  coverage in exchange for the payment of the premium.Â  The premiums were\r\n  admittedly received and misapplied. Â While the Dealership argues that it is not\r\n  an insurance provider and that it was only offering to obtain quotes for Beatrice,\r\n  it nonetheless accepted and retained payments for insurance coverage it never\r\n  obtained for an extensive period of time.Â  The acceptance of these payments at\r\n  a minimum presents a question as to the existence of a contract as well as a\r\n  question as to the Dealershipâ€™s liability for said coverage.Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  established that the Estate suffered damage, we now turn to the remainder of\r\n  the Estateâ€™s allegations.Â  First, as to the breach of contract claim, there is\r\n  sufficient evidence as to the existence of a contract and its breach by the\r\n  Dealership.Â  Further, sufficient evidence exists in the record for a jury to\r\n  conclude that the Estate, as legal owner of the automobile, was damaged by the\r\n  breach of that contract.Â  Second, the Dealership admitted to accepting and\r\n  retaining the insurance premiums for its own benefit, thereby creating at least\r\n  an inference that the funds were improperly converted, although eventually\r\n  returned.Â  Third, as to the negligence cause of action, due to the nature of the\r\n  relationship between the Dealership and Beatrice, the Dealership had a duty to\r\n  properly utilize the insurance premiums paid to obtain the proper insurance\r\n  coverage; otherwise, at a minimum, the Dealership should have indicated that\r\n  coverage was not obtained.Â  Sufficient evidence exists in the record that such\r\n  duty was breached and that the breach proximately injured the Estate, thereby warranting\r\n  the submission of the claim to the jury.Â  The mere fact the Dealership\r\n  subsequently realized its error and refunded the alleged premiums is not dispositive\r\n  as to whether the Estateâ€™s claims may proceed.\r\nAccordingly, we respectfully find the court erred in directing a\r\n  verdict as to the causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, and\r\n  negligence.\r\nThe Estate next asserts that the court erred in directing a\r\n  verdict on its cause of action for a violation of the Dealers Act.Â  The Dealers\r\n  Act declares certain unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts\r\n  or practices to be unlawful. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-30(a) (2006). Â It is a\r\n  violation of the Dealers Act for any manufacturer or motor vehicle dealer â€œto\r\n  engage in any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable and\r\n  which causes damage to any of the parties or to the public.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-15-40(1) (2006).\r\nOur supreme court has defined the term â€œarbitraryâ€ for purposes of\r\n  the Dealers Act to include â€œacts which are unreasonable, capricious or\r\n  nonrational; not done according to reason or judgment; depending on will\r\n  alone.â€ Taylor v. Nix, 307 S.C. 551, 555, 416 S.E.2d 619,\r\n  621 (1992). Furthermore, our supreme court has defined bad faith as:\r\n\r\n\tThe opposite of good faith, generally\r\n  implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to deceive or\r\n  mislead another, or a neglect or refusal to [fulfill] some duty or some\r\n  contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to oneâ€™s rights or\r\n  duties, but by some interested or sinister motive.\r\n\r\nState v.\r\n  Griffin, 100 S.C. 331, 333, 84 S.E. 876, 877\r\n  (1915) (quoting Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary).\r\nâ€œThe Dealers Act defines â€˜fraudâ€™ to include its â€˜normal legal\r\n  connotationâ€™ as well as â€˜misrepresentation in any manner, whether\r\n  intentionally false or due to gross negligence, of a material fact; a promise\r\n  or representation not made honestly and in good faith; and an intentional\r\n  failure to disclose a material fact.â€™â€ deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc.,\r\n  342 S.C. 254, 263-64, 536 S.E.2d 399, 404 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-15-10(m) (1991)).\r\nTo be liable under the Dealers Act, the\r\n  dealer must participate in the wrongful conduct. Â Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 302, 486 S.E.2d 750, 756 (1997). â€œAn agent for an entity who\r\n  makes misrepresentations while attempting to sell a motor vehicle qualifies as\r\n  a dealer who may be held liable under this act.â€ Id. at 302, 486 S.E.2d\r\n  at 756.Â  The record contains evidence of misrepresentations by the Dealership.Â \r\n  Whether intentional or not, the president of the Dealership admitted to\r\n  unintentionally offering numerous misleading explanations regarding the\r\n  ultimate disposition of the insurance premiums.Â  These misrepresentations constitute\r\n  a sufficient basis to submit the violation of the Dealers Act cause of action to\r\n  the jury.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on\r\n  this cause of action.\r\nFinally, the Estate claims the trial court\r\n  erred in directing a verdict on its SCUTPA cause of action.Â  To recover in an\r\n  action under the SCUTPA, the plaintiff must show: (1) the defendant engaged in\r\n  an unfair or deceptive act in the conduct of trade or commerce; (2) the unfair\r\n  or deceptive act affected the public interest; and (3) the plaintiff suffered\r\n  monetary or property loss as a result of the defendantâ€™s unfair or deceptive\r\n  act(s). Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-10-560 (Supp. 2007).Â  The second element may be\r\n  satisfied by proof of â€œfacts demonstrating\r\n  the potential for repetition of the defendantâ€™s actions.â€ Daisy Outdoor\r\n    Adver. Co., Inc. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49\r\n  (1996). Â â€œPlaintiffs . . . generally have shown potential for repetition in two\r\n  ways: (1) by showing the same kind of actions occurred in the past, thus making\r\n  it likely they will continue to occur absent deterrence . . . or (2) by showing\r\n  the companyâ€™s procedures create a potential for repetition of the unfair and\r\n  deceptive acts.â€ Id. at 496, 473 S.E.2d at 51 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nSufficient evidence exists in the record for submission of this\r\n  cause of action to the jury.Â  The first and third elements of the cause of\r\n  action are sufficiently supported by the evidence for submission to the jury\r\n  for reasons similar to those as necessary for submission of the Dealers Act\r\n  claim.Â  The public interest element necessitates additional scrutiny. Â The Estate,\r\n  while questioning the president of the Dealership, specifically inquired about\r\n  the existence of safeguards to ensure that unapplied premiums would be\r\n  refunded.Â  While the response to the question was unclear, an inference could\r\n  be made that the Dealership lacked internal protections to prevent the\r\n  reoccurrence of this conduct in the future.Â  The conduct complained of herein\r\n  continued for approximately three years without action.[3]Â  Therefore, there is some evidence\r\n  relating to the potential for public harm which justifies the submission of the\r\n  SCUTPA claim to the jury.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred by directing a\r\n  verdict against the Estate as to the SCUTPA cause of action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the order\r\n  of the trial court directing a verdict against the Estate is hereby\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and CURETON, A.J. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Firstar subsequently sold the note to U.S. Bank.\r\n[2] This concept is currently codified in section\r\n  62-3-101 which states that a decedentâ€™s personal property â€œdevolves, first, to\r\n  his personal representative.â€ S.C.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4411 \r\nHeard March 6, 2008 â€“ Filed June 10, 2008Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMichael F. Talley, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAdamÂ  Fisher, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent(s).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.: Â Ruby Rice (Rice) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order denying her\r\n  motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment against her.Â  Rice also appeals\r\n  the entry of judgment in favor of William and Elena Tobias (William and Elena).Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliam and Elena filed the underlying complaint in\r\n  this case on May 7, 2004.Â  In their complaint, they allege the following four\r\n  causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) conversion; (3) unjust\r\n  enrichment; and (4) specific performance.Â  The allegations arose from two lease\r\n  agreements and an alleged oral purchase contract between William and Elena and Rice\r\n  for a number of residential apartments in two separate apartment buildings in Greenville,   S.C., one on Haughty Court and one on Summit Place.Â  The lease agreements\r\n  were structured such that William and Elena would be responsible for\r\n  maintaining the apartments, collecting rent, finding tenants, and generally\r\n  managing the properties in return for below market value rental payments for\r\n  those properties.Â  These lease agreements allowed William and Elena to sublet\r\n  the apartments for a greater amount of rent than they were obligated to pay Rice,\r\n  thereby creating a profit margin.Â  In addition, William and Elena allege that\r\n  they had an oral option to purchase the above-referenced properties from Rice\r\n  for a purchase price of $144,000.00 for the Haughty Court property and\r\n  $288,000.00 for the Summit Place property.Â  \r\nWilliam and Elena further\r\n  assert that Rice violated her duties under the contracts by unilaterally\r\n  cancelling the lease agreements and excluding William and Elena from these\r\n  rental properties once they had successfully subleased each of the individual\r\n  units to tenants.Â  They claim that in reliance on their option to purchase the\r\n  buildings, they expended some $68,000.00 in improving the properties.Â  In order\r\n  to be compensated, William and Elena also seek specific performance on the oral\r\n  option contract. \r\nIn her answer, Rice\r\n  admits the existence of one of the lease agreements, but specifically denies\r\n  the existence of any lease agreement on the Summit place property or the\r\n  existence of any option or purchase agreement on either property.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Rice alleges that William and Elena defaulted under the lease provisions and\r\n  were excluded properly from the properties pursuant to magistrate court\r\n  procedures. \r\nThe procedural history of this case is important since\r\n  it is the foundation of the motion to vacate and/or set aside the judgment.Â \r\n  Following the May 7, 2004, filing of the complaint, Rice hired attorney Rodman\r\n  Tullis to represent her.Â  Communication problems existed from the outset of\r\n  their attorney-client relationship and as a result, both Rice and her counsel\r\n  filed a separate answer and counterclaim on Riceâ€™s behalf on August 3, 2004.Â \r\n  However, throughout these proceedings, Mr. Tullis was listed as Riceâ€™s attorney\r\n  of record with the clerk of court.\r\nWilliam and Elena's\r\n  trial counsel, Randall Hiller, Esquire, indicated to the court that in order to\r\n  obtain discovery, multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to contact attorney Tullis.Â  As a result, he filed a motion to compel which was granted by the\r\n  Honorable D. Garrison Hill by order dated April 26, 2005.Â  Judge Hillâ€™s order\r\n  indicates that neither Rice nor her counsel appeared at the motion hearing.Â \r\n  Judge Hill further found the record reflected that interrogatories were served\r\n  and had gone unanswered.Â  He then ordered Rice to respond to discovery requests\r\n  within thirty (30) days from the date of service of that order, and in the\r\n  event of noncompliance, Riceâ€™s answer and counterclaim would be dismissed with\r\n  prejudice.Â  Judge Hill, aware of potential communication problems between Rice\r\n  and her attorney, directed attorney Hiller to serve a copy of his order on both\r\n  attorney Tullis and Rice individually. \r\nRice was served\r\n  with that order in June 2005; since she was unable to get in touch with Mr. Tullis, Rice contacted attorney J. Patricia Anderson, Esquire, who called\r\n  attorney Hillerâ€™s office requesting a thirty day extension to answer the\r\n  complaint.Â  Attorney Hiller ultimately denied the request pursuant to a\r\n  facsimile letter advising Anderson that the relevant deadline pertained to\r\n  discovery responses and that he was unwilling to grant an extension to that\r\n  deadline.Â  Due to the denial of the extension, Anderson did not become Riceâ€™s\r\n  counsel of record.Â  There was no further communication from Anderson to\r\n  attorney Hiller, nor from any other attorney representing Rice.\r\nThe case then\r\n  appeared on the Greenville County non-jury docket for the week of November 7,\r\n  2005, with a mandatory roster meeting scheduled that same day before the Honorable\r\n  John C. Few.Â  Attorney Hiller appeared on behalf of William and Elena but no\r\n  one was present for Rice.Â  The matter was set to be tried the following day.\r\nThe trial took\r\n  place on November 8, 2005, at which time Judge Few was made aware of the\r\n  inattentive manner in which attorney Tullis had represented his client in these\r\n  proceedings.Â  However, the trial commenced in Riceâ€™s absence.Â  Judgment was\r\n  entered by order dated November 24, 2005, wherein William and Elena were\r\n  granted judgment in the amount of $211,700.00 with interest thereon at 8.75%\r\n  from April, 2004, to the date of the order and at the judgment rate\r\n  thereafter.Â  Judge Few further ordered Rice to attend a closing for the sale of\r\n  the two above-referenced properties to William and Elena for a total sales price\r\n  of $432,000.00, from which William and Elena would be entitled to offset\r\n  against the purchase price the amount of the judgment obtained. \r\nRice was served\r\n  with Judge Fewâ€™s order on December 1, 2005, and filed a motion to reconsider\r\n  claiming that her attorney was disbarred and failed to inform her of the\r\n  commencement of the trial proceedings.Â  She hired Michael Talley to represent\r\n  her.Â  Attorney Talley filed a motion to vacate and/or set aside the judgment on\r\n  January 20, 2006.Â  Judge Few entertained Mr. Talleyâ€™s motion (not the pro se\r\n  motion) to vacate at a hearing on January 3, 2007, and denied that motion by\r\n  form order the same day.Â  Rice now appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of the\r\n  motion to vacate and/or set aside the judgment against her.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether to grant or\r\n  deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.Â  Raby\r\n    Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17-18, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004).Â  An\r\n  appellate courtâ€™s standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining\r\n  whether there was an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  Relief under Rule\r\n  60(b)(1), SCRCP, lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will\r\n  not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Paul Davis Sys.,\r\n    Inc. v. Deepwater of Hilton Head, LLC, 362 S.C. 220, 225, 607 S.E.2d 358,\r\n  360 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion arises where the order was\r\n  controlled by an error of law or where the order is based on factual\r\n  conclusions that are without evidentiary support. Tri-County Ice &amp; Fuel\r\n    Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782\r\n  (1990).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nRiceâ€™s first three issues on appeal pertain to issues\r\n  of notice and depend on whether there was a default judgment damages hearing or\r\n  a trial.Â  Each of Riceâ€™s first three grounds for appeal attempt to place some\r\n  affirmative duty on William and Elena to give Rice notice of the trial.Â \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 55(b), SCRCP, a party seeking a default judgment not involving\r\n  liquidated damages must provide three days notice to the opposing side;\r\n  however, this requirement would only be applicable in the case at hand if William\r\n  and Elena actually sought a default judgment.Â  \r\nA\r\n  similar situation was dealt with by this court in Goodson v. Am. Bankers\r\n    Ins. Co. of Fla., 295 S.C. 400, 368 S.E.2d 687 (1988).Â  In the concurrence\r\n  portion of Judge Curetonâ€™s opinion in Goodson, he articulately points\r\n  out that the defendant was not in default for failing to appear at trial when\r\n  it had filed an answer, where there had been no application for default, and\r\n  where default had not been entered by the clerk. Â Id. at 403, 368 S.E.2d at 690.Â  Recently, this court again relying on\r\n  similar logic reached the same conclusion.Â  In RRR, Inc. v. Toggas, Op.\r\n  No. 4375 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 97), this court held that where the\r\n  plaintiff did not seek or file for a default judgment but instead proceeded to\r\n  a judgment on the merits, the notice prescribed in Rule 55(b)(2) is\r\n  inapplicable.Â  \r\nIn the case herein, Rice had answered and filed a counterclaim; no\r\n  application for default was ever made, and no default was ever entered by the\r\n  clerk.Â  While Rice argues that Judge Hillâ€™s order states that the failure to\r\n  answer interrogatories will result in her answer and counterclaim being\r\n  dismissed with prejudice, that order was not automatically effective and there\r\n  was never a motion made to enforce that order.Â  We cannot assume an order of\r\n  the type at issue would be automatically effective when the court would only be\r\n  aware of the failure to comply with the order pursuant to some application by\r\n  the movant to enforce that order.Â  Absent any such motion to enforce the\r\n  courtâ€™s order, compliance is presumed under these circumstances.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  not only was Riceâ€™s answer and counterclaim not dismissed, it was referred to\r\n  and considered by the judge at trial.Â  Therefore, this court will not\r\n  treat the trial as a default judgment hearing; as a result, the notice\r\n  provision in Rule 55(b)(2) is inapplicable.\r\nDespite the fact that Riceâ€™s primary argument on appeal is that William\r\n  and Elena should have provided her notice, we do find the overall situation\r\n  troubling, especially as it pertains to the adequacy of trial notice given to Rice.Â \r\n  As evidenced by the record, Riceâ€™s counsel of record, Mr. Tullis, was mailed\r\n  and faxed notice of the mandatory roster meeting, thereby providing adequate\r\n  notice of trial.Â  On the other hand, it is undisputed that Mr. Tullis was\r\n  providing inadequate representation to Rice throughout the circuit court\r\n  proceedings.Â  Mr. Tullis had some disciplinary history which ultimately\r\n  culminated in his disbarment in 2007 and included a suspension in 2005 for\r\n  failure to comply with CLE requirements and failure to pay bar dues.[1]Â  \r\nThe general rule is that the neglect of an attorney will be\r\n  imputed to the client preventing the client from using the attorneyâ€™s neglect\r\n  as a ground for relief in a later motion to vacate.Â  Mitchell Supply Co. v.\r\n    Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 163-64, 375 S.E.2d 321, 323 (Ct. App. 1988).Â \r\n  However, â€œthis is not a hard and fast rule.Â  Rather, it\r\n  is one that is â€˜to be applied rationally, with a fair recognition that justice\r\n  to the litigants is always the polestar.â€â€™ Brown v. Butler, 347 S.C.\r\n  259, 554 S.E.2d 431 (App. Ct. 2001) (quoting 7A C.J.S. Attorney &amp; Client Â§ 181, at 284 (1980)).Â  Furthermore, this general rule is not always applicable\r\n  when the attorneyâ€™s neglect rises to the level of willful abandonment.Â  Graham\r\n    v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 452, 248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978); see also 7A C.J.S. Attorney &amp; Client Â§ 181, at 285 (1980) (where\r\n  the conduct of counsel is outrageously in violation of his implicit duty to\r\n  devote reasonable efforts in representing his client, his acts will not always\r\n  be imputed to his client).\r\nNotwithstanding, Rice did not move to vacate the judgment based on\r\n  excusable neglect by arguing that the negligence of her counsel should not be\r\n  imputed to her due to his willful abandonment of her case, nor does she attempt\r\n  to raise this ground on appeal.Â  While arguably one could assert that this\r\n  ground was raised in Riceâ€™s pro se motion to reconsider, that motion was never\r\n  ruled on by the trial court and the issue was never raised on appeal.Â  In order\r\n  for an issue to be properly presented for appeal, Rice's brief must set forth\r\n  the issue in the statement of issues on appeal. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR; Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 285, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001). Â Further, it is error\r\n  for the appellate court to consider issues not properly raised\r\n  to it. Â First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d\r\n  513, 514 (1994) (stating appellant must provide authority and supporting\r\n  arguments for his issue to be considered raised on appeal).Â  Accordingly, we may not consider this issue. \r\nAs to the excusable neglect of Rice, the decision of the trial\r\n  court is supported by the fact that Rice was on notice of the problems she was\r\n  facing with her counsel of record in June 2005 at the latest, when she was\r\n  served with Judge Hillâ€™s order.Â  While she attempted to obtain new counsel at\r\n  one point, she was unsuccessful and made no further attempts despite knowing\r\n  that the failure to answer the interrogatories would result in the dismissal of\r\n  her answer and counterclaim with prejudice.Â  For almost six months she never contacted\r\n  the clerk to ensure that she was served with all relevant notices, never\r\n  obtained new counsel, nor moved to relieve counsel.Â  We do not find an abuse of\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s discretion in his apparent reliance on the proposition that\r\n  â€œa party has a duty to monitor the progress of his case.â€Â  Hill v. Dotts,\r\n  345 S.C. 304, 310, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Goodson v.\r\n    Am. Bankers Ins. Co., 295 S.C. 400, 403, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988).Â  Rice was aware of her dire legal situation for at least six months, and\r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in refusing to grant her relief based on her own\r\n  negligence as opposed to excusable neglect for her attorneyâ€™s negligence, which\r\n  has not been raised on appeal.\r\nRice also asserts the trial court should have set aside its\r\n  judgment because the grant of specific performance absent a written contract\r\n  violates the statute of frauds.Â  This issue was not raised at trial and was\r\n  only raised to the trial judge in the context of a meritorious defense, one of\r\n  the factors considered by the trial court when ruling on a Rule 60, SCRCP\r\n  motion.Â  See Hill, 345 S.C. at 309, 547 S.E.2d at 897.Â \r\n  Therefore, it is only proper for this court to consider this issue in that\r\n  context. Â \r\nA court may relieve a party from a final judgment for mistake,\r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Â Rule 60(b)(1),\r\n  SCRCP. In determining whether a default judgment should be set aside under Rule 60(b)(1), â€œ[t]he promptness with which relief is\r\n  sought, the reasons for the failure to act promptly, the existence of [a] meritorious defense, and the prejudice\r\n  to the other parties are relevant.â€ N.H. Ins. Co. v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47, 50, 435 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 1993) (quoting Harry M. Lightsey\r\n  &amp; James F. Flanagan, South\r\n    Carolina Civil Procedure 82 (1985)).Â  The alleged violation of the statute\r\n  of frauds, if true, would amount to a mistake of law, not a mistake of fact.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the issue is not persuasive since a party may not generally use\r\n  Rule 60(b)(1) as a vehicle for relief from a mistake of law.Â  Hillman v.\r\n    Pinion, 347 S.C. 253, 256, 554 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct.

App. 2001) (Relief from a judgment under Rule 60 is\r\n  not a substitute for appeal).Â  While we may not agree with the trial judge's\r\n  rulings on the application of the law at trial, because we find no abuse of\r\n  discretion by the trial court as to excusable neglect, the mere allegation that\r\n  the trial judge made a mistake of law on the merits is not properly presented\r\n  for the first time in a Rule 60 motion and is insufficient by itself as\r\n  presented to warrant reversal.Â  Since this appeal is postured on grounds solely\r\n  related to the denial of the Rule 60 motion, as opposed to a direct appeal of\r\n  the rulings outside of the Rule 60 context, we find no reversible error.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See In the Matter of Rodman C.

Thames, all of Columbia; and Solicitor\r\n          David Michael Pascoe, Jr., of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Christopher Williams was convicted of two\r\n  counts of assault of a high and aggravated nature (AHAN), one count of\r\n  attempted escape, and two counts of kidnapping.Â  He was sentenced to two\r\n  concurrent terms of ten years in prison for AHAN, a consecutive term of fifteen\r\n  years in prison for attempted escape, and two concurrent terms of life in\r\n  prison without parole for the kidnappings.Â  Williams appeals, contending the\r\n  trial court committed reversible error by sustaining the Stateâ€™s Batson[1] motion and thereafter mandating that a challenged juror be seated on the new\r\n  jury.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nI.\r\nThe\r\n  Stateâ€™s Batson motion began with a challenge to all of Williamsâ€™ peremptory\r\n  challenges.Â  Rather than requiring the State to be more specific, the court\r\n  required Williams to account for all strikes.Â  Williams did so, and the inquiry\r\n  narrowed to three potential jurors.Â  The court granted the Stateâ€™s Batson motion regarding the three jurors.Â  The court precluded Williams from striking\r\n  any of the three jurors (Jurors 78, 72 and 116) when the jury was redrawn.Â \r\n  Because only Juror 78 was called and served on the jury that convicted Williams,\r\n  the appeal is limited to Juror 78.\r\nWilliamsâ€™\r\n  counsel said he struck Juror 78, a white male, â€œbecause his wife is unemployedâ€\r\n  and he â€œusually like[d] to have jurors that consider their spouse somewhat\r\n  equal and they both work.â€Â  The State contended the reason was pretextual\r\n  because Williamsâ€™ counsel sat Juror 81, also a white male, who is unemployed.Â  Williamsâ€™\r\n  counsel maintained that there is a fundamental difference between a juror who\r\n  is unemployed and a juror whose spouse is unemployed.Â  Williamsâ€™ counsel\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    And\r\n      as far as I struck [Juror 78] because his wife was unemployed, and he said I\r\n      sat somebody who was unemployed.Â  Thereâ€™s a difference between a juror being\r\n      unemployed and a jurorâ€™s wife being unemployed, and thatâ€™s where I make my\r\n      difference, Your Honor.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  State then turned its argument to, â€œHow is that any different from every juror\r\n  thatâ€™s a single juror then?â€Â  Williamsâ€™ counsel reiterated his distinction\r\n  between jurors who are unemployed and spouses of jurors who are unemployed.Â \r\n  Concerning unmarried jurors, defense counsel asserted that â€œevery juror thatâ€™s\r\n  single wouldnâ€™t be sitting here thinking how much money is my unemployed wife\r\n  at home spending . . . .Â  Thereâ€™s a big difference between a single juror and a\r\n  married juror.â€Â  \r\nWithout\r\n  further discussion, the trial court granted the Stateâ€™s Batson motion,\r\n  observing that, in connection with Juror 78, â€œsomeone similarly situated was\r\n  seated of a different race.â€ Â Williams claims the trial court erred in both of\r\n  its stated reasons.Â  First, according to Williams, the other juror (Juror 81)\r\n  may not properly be considered â€œsimilarly situated,â€ as Williams repeatedly\r\n  emphasized to the trial court his distinction between an unemployed juror and\r\n  an employed juror whose spouse is unemployed.Â  Second, the other juror, Juror\r\n  81, is white (as is Juror 78) and therefore not of a â€œdifferent raceâ€ from\r\n  Juror 78.Â  We agree with Williams on both counts, and as a result, we reverse\r\n  and remand for a new trial.\r\nII.\r\nIf a\r\n  trial court improperly grants the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, but none of the\r\n  disputed jurors thereafter serve on the jury, any error in improperly quashing\r\n  the jury is harmless because a defendant is not entitled to a particular jury.Â  State v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 631 S.E.2d 244 (2006).Â  Conversely, if\r\n  one of the jurors is thereafter seated on the jury, then the erroneous Batson ruling has tainted the jury and prejudice is presumed in such cases â€œbecause\r\n  there is no way to determine with any degree of certainty whether a defendantâ€™s\r\n  right to a fair trial by an impartial jury was abridged.â€Â  Id. at 114,\r\n  631 S.E.2d at 248; see also State v. Short, 327 S.C. 329, 489\r\n  S.E.2d 209 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding the remedy for the improper granting of a Batson motion where a disputed juror is seated on the new jury is a new trial).\r\nEven in light of the deference given trial judges in Batson motions, we are persuaded that error has been established in this case.Â  The\r\n  State, in its brief, acknowledges that Williams â€œoffered race-neutral reasons\r\n  for his strikes.â€Â  We agree that Williams offered a race-neutral reason for\r\n  striking Juror 78.Â  The State has no good answer for the trial courtâ€™s clearly\r\n  erroneous statement that â€œsomeone similarly situated [Juror 81] was seated of a\r\n  different race.â€Â  The State suggests the trial court really meant to say that\r\n  the strike â€œwas so fundamentally implausible [as] to not require disparate\r\n  treatment.â€Â  Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  reject the Stateâ€™s efforts to rescue the trial courtâ€™s erroneous Batson ruling,\r\n  and we decline the invitation to recast the trial courtâ€™s ruling to something\r\n  it was not.Â  In any event, we do not view as â€œfundamentally implausibleâ€ the\r\n  idea that counsel may draw a distinction between the employment status of a\r\n  prospective juror and the employment status of the spouse of a prospective\r\n  juror.[2]Â \r\n  More to the point, employment, or lack of it, is a well-understood and\r\n  recognized consideration in the exercise of peremptory challenges.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 632, 515 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1999) (stating unemployment is\r\n  a race-neutral reason for a strike); State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 65, 512\r\n  S.E.2d 500, 504 (1999) (holding place of employment is a race-neutral reason\r\n  for a strike); see State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 125, 470 S.E.2d\r\n  366, 372 (1996) (finding type of employment is a race-neutral reason for a\r\n  strike).Â  And finally, there is no evidence that someone similarly situated to\r\n  Juror 78 was seated, i.e., no other juror was seated whose spouse was\r\n  unemployed.\r\nIII.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, Williams articulated a race-neutral reason for striking Juror 78, and the\r\n  State failed to establish that a similarly situated juror was seated.Â  The\r\n  proper remedy is a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON AND\r\n  HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n[2]Â  See State v. Haigler,&nbsp;334 S.C. 623, 629, 515\r\n  S.E.2d 88, 91&nbsp;(1999) (â€œPretext generally will be established by showing\r\n  that similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury.Â \r\n  Under some circumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the proponent\r\n  may be so fundamentally implausible that the judge may determine, at the third\r\n  step of the analysis, that the explanation was mere pretext even without a\r\n  showing of disparate treatment.â€) (emphasis added).Â  As noted, Jurors 78 and 81\r\n  are both white and they are not â€œsimilarly situated,â€ as Juror 81 is unemployed\r\nand the spouse of Juror 78 is unemployed.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4413","title":"Snavely v.

Snavely\r\n  appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of Piedmont Medical Centerâ€™s (Piedmont) motion\r\n  for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  January 20, 2003, Carol Brooks, Snavelyâ€™s sister-in-law, drove Snavely to the\r\n  emergency room of Piedmont because Snavely was complaining of weakness,\r\n  jaundice, and abdominal pain.[2]Â \r\n  Per Snavelyâ€™s request, Mrs. Brooks accompanied her to a private examination\r\n  room.Â  Dr. Zellner, an emergency room physician working at Piedmont, examined\r\n  Snavely in Mrs. Brooksâ€™ presence and questioned Snavely regarding her\r\n  symptoms.Â  After completing the examination and reviewing Snavelyâ€™s medical\r\n  history, Dr. Zellner informed Snavely â€œshe had likely contracted some form of\r\n  hepatitis.â€Â  To confirm his diagnosis, Dr. Zellner ordered Snavely undergo\r\n  â€œblood work and an ultrasound.â€Â  Shortly thereafter, Snavelyâ€™s brother, James\r\n  Brooks, arrived at Piedmont and joined Snavely in the examination room[3] where Mrs. Brooks informed him of Dr. Zellnerâ€™s preliminary diagnosis. \r\nAfter\r\n  obtaining the results of Snavelyâ€™s blood tests, Dr. Zellner returned to the\r\n  examination room and confirmed to Mr. and Mrs. Brooks the diagnosis of\r\n  hepatitis.Â  Dr. Zellner also indicated he would refer Snavely to a specialist\r\n  to determine the type of hepatitis she had contracted.Â  The next day, the Brookses\r\n  accompanied Snavely to the office of Dr. Debra Gazzuolo.Â  After completing a\r\n  physical examination and reviewing Snavelyâ€™s test results, Dr. Gazzuolo\r\n  informed Snavely she contracted Hepatitis B.Â  Dr. Gazzuolo provided Snavely\r\n  information about Hepatitis B, including a pamphlet explaining the nature of\r\n  the disease and methods to avoid transmitting it to others.Â  Snavely then\r\n  shared this diagnosis with the Brookses, and allowed them to review the\r\n  information Dr. Gazzuolo provided.Â  Subsequently, either Mr. or Mrs. Brooks\r\n  disclosed Snavelyâ€™s condition to her employer, a local restaurant, and she was\r\n  fired.[4]Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  her termination, Snavely filed an action against Piedmont and Dr. Zellner for\r\n  breach of patient-physician confidentiality.Â  Specifically, Snavely alleged Dr.\r\n  Zellner unlawfully disclosed her medical condition to the Brookses, and Piedmont was responsible for any unlawful act of Dr. Zellner.Â  In response, Piedmont filed a motion for summary judgment asserting Snavely consented to the disclosure\r\n  of her condition by allowing the Brookses to remain in the examination room at\r\n  the time Dr. Zellner delivered his diagnosis.Â  At the motion for summary\r\n  judgment hearing, the trial court ruled in favor of Piedmont finding:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    [Snavely]\r\n        permitted Mrs. Brooks to remain in the examination room while Dr. Zellner\r\n        performed his examination, and when he advised [Snavely] of his diagnosis.Â  By\r\n        allowing her sister-in-law to remain in the room throughout Dr. Zellnerâ€™s\r\n        examination, [Snavely] at least tacitly consented to disclosure of her medical\r\n        conditions to her sister-in-law.Â  \r\n    [Snavely]\r\n        then allowed her brother and sister-in-law to accompany her to Dr. Gazzuoloâ€™s\r\n        office the following day and after seeing the doctor, confirmed to the Brooks\r\n        her specific diagnosis of Hepatitis B.Â  [Snavely] also shared a pamphlet with\r\n        her brother and sister-in-law that discussed the disease and ways to prevent\r\n        spreading it.Â  [Snavely] made no attempt to conceal her medical condition;\r\n        rather, she involved her brother and sister-in-law at each stage.Â  Thus, she\r\n        cannot complain that any negligence, assuming there was any, of Dr. Zellner\r\n        caused her injury. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSnavelyâ€™s\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration was denied.Â  Shortly thereafter,\r\n  Dr. Zellner filed a motion to dismiss based upon the trial courtâ€™s grant of\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Piedmont.Â  The trial court granted Dr. Zellnerâ€™s\r\n  motion, concluding â€œthe issue of negligence was held to be solely that of\r\n  [Snavely] and no one else.Â  Moreover, medical confidences were waived by\r\n  consenting to the inclusion of family members in medical examination,\r\n  diagnosis, and treatment.â€Â  The trial court further found the collateral\r\n  estoppel doctrine barred Snavely from litigating her claims against Dr. Zellner.Â \r\n  In response to the trial courtâ€™s order of dismissal, Snavely filed another Rule\r\n  59(e) motion, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  proper where no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Hurst v. East Coast Hockey League, Inc., 371 S.C. 33, 36, 637 S.E.2d 560, 561\r\n  (2006).Â  On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard governing the trial court.Â  Id. The trial court should grant summary judgment â€œif the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329,\r\n  334&nbsp;(2003) (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP).Â  In determining whether any\r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law\r\n    v. S.C. Department of Corrections, 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642,\r\n  648&nbsp;(2006). Â â€œA court considering summary judgment neither makes factual\r\n  determinations nor considers the merits of competing testimony; however,\r\n  summary judgment is completely appropriate when a properly supported motion\r\n  sets forth facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.â€Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1,\r\n  5&nbsp;(2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Summary Judgment\r\nSnavely\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting Piedmontâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment based upon: (1) Snavelyâ€™s lack of consent to the disclosure of her\r\n  medical condition; (2) Piedmontâ€™s contributory negligence; (3) the contradicted\r\n  findings of fact relied upon by the trial court; (4) invasion of privacy; and\r\n  (5) the doctrine of ostensible agency.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Snavelyâ€™s Consent to\r\n  Disclosure\r\nSnavely\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting Piedmontâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment because she did not consent to the disclosure of her medical\r\n  condition.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  South Carolina does not recognize physician-patient testimonial privilege,[5] the law does recognize an action against a physician for the disclosure of\r\n  confidential information, unless the disclosure is compelled by law or\r\n  consented to by the patient.Â  McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627,\r\n  635-40, 494 S.E.2d 431, 435-37 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Aakjer\r\n    v. Spagnoli, 291 S.C. 165, 173, 352 S.E.2d 503, 508 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œThere\r\n  is no physician-patient privilege in South Carolina.â€).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Snavely implicitly consented to the disclosure of her medical\r\n  condition by involving the Brookses at every stage of her medical treatment.Â  By\r\n  her own admission, Snavely â€œchose to take [Mrs. Brooks] backâ€ to the\r\n  examination room and did not ask her to leave during Dr. Zellnerâ€™s examination.Â  Specifically, Snavely testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Okay.&nbsp; And you chose to take [Mrs. Brooks] back with you?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Okay.&nbsp; That was your decision?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:&nbsp;\r\n    Okay.&nbsp; And you met Dr. Zellner in an examining room?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Okay.&nbsp; And what occurred in the examining room?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:&nbsp;\r\n    [Dr. Zellner] asked me what my symptoms were.&nbsp; I\r\n  told him.&nbsp; He told me that he was guessing right now with hepatitis, but not\r\n  sure which one and that he would send me for blood work and an ultrasound. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Snavely permitted the Brookses to accompany her to Dr. Gazzuoloâ€™s office where\r\n  her diagnosis of Hepatitis B was confirmed.Â  Additionally, Snavely shared a\r\n  pamphlet with the Brookses discussing the disease and preventive treatments.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting summary based upon the finding Snavely â€œat least tacitly consentedâ€ to\r\n  the disclosure of her medical condition.Â  \r\nB. Contributory Negligence\r\nSnavely\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting Piedmontâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment by failing to find Piedmont contributorily negligent.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn order to establish a cause of action in negligence, a plaintiff\r\n  must prove the following three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by defendant\r\n  to plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3)\r\n  damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira,\r\n  339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 712 (2000).Â  â€œHowever, under South Carolinaâ€™s comparative negligence doctrine, a plaintiff may only recover damages if his own\r\n  negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.â€Â  Id. at 422, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 712-13.Â  Generally, a â€œcomparison of the plaintiffâ€™s negligence\r\n  with that of the defendant is a question\r\n  of fact for the jury to decide.â€Â  Id. at 422, 529 S.E.2d 713. Â In a\r\n  comparative negligence case, the trial court should only determine judgment as\r\n  a matter of law if the sole reasonable inference which may be drawn from the\r\n  evidence is the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.Â  See Hopson\r\n    v. Clary, 321 S.C. 312, 314, 468 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œIf the evidence as a whole is susceptible to only one\r\n  reasonable inference, no jury issue is created.â€).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Snavely fails to prove any negligent act attributable to Dr. Zellner was the\r\n  proximate cause of the disclosure of her medical condition.Â  Indeed, the record contains no evidence suggesting Dr.\r\n  Zellner, or anyone else connected with Piedmont, disclosed her condition\r\n  outside the examination room.Â  Furthermore, Snavely consented to the disclosure\r\n  of her medical condition by (1) allowing the Brookses to remain in the\r\n  examination room; (2) involving the Brookses at every stage of her medical\r\n  treatment; (3) sharing information explaining the disease with the Brookses;\r\n  and (4) making no attempt to conceal her condition.Â  Consequently, Snavelyâ€™s\r\n  negligence in consenting to the disclosure of her medical condition exceeded\r\n  any negligent act of Dr. Zellner.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in\r\n  granting Piedmont summary judgment based upon the doctrine of comparative\r\n  negligence. \r\nC. Uncontradicted v.\r\n  Contradicted Findings of Fact\r\nSnavely\r\n  alleges the trial court erroneously relied upon contradicted facts in granting Piedmontâ€™s motion for summary judgment because the record contains factual discrepancies\r\n  regarding the disclosure of her medical condition.Â  We disagree. \r\nMindful\r\n  of the summary judgment standard of review, we note the record contains many\r\n  facts which, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Snavely, clearly\r\n  show Snavely at least tacitly consented to the disclosure of her medical\r\n  condition.Â  Snavely involved the Brookses at every stage of her medical\r\n  treatment and made no attempt to conceal her condition.Â  Consequently, any factual discrepancies\r\n  which might exist as to Piedmontâ€™s contributory negligence cannot alter the\r\n  inescapable conclusion Snavelyâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.Â  Under South Carolina jurisprudence, where evidence of the plaintiffâ€™s greater negligence is\r\n  overwhelming, evidence of slight negligence on the part of the defendant is\r\n  simply not enough for a case to go to the jury.Â  See Hopson, 321 S.C. at 314, 468 S.E.2d at 307.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not err in granting\r\n  summary judgment. \r\nD. Publication\r\nLastly,\r\n  Snavely argues the trial court erred in granting Piedmont summary judgment\r\n  because the publication of her medical condition to the Brookses amounts to an\r\n  invasion of privacy.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\n  Invasion of privacy consists of the public disclosure of private\r\n    facts about the plaintiff, and the gravamen of the tort is publicity as opposed to mere publication.Â  The defendant must intentionally reveal facts\r\n    which are of no legitimate public interest, as there is no right of privacy in\r\n    public matters.Â  In addition, the disclosure must be such as would be highly\r\n    offensive and likely to cause serious mental injury to a person of ordinary\r\n    sensibilities. \r\n\r\nMcCormick, 328 S.C. at 640, 494 S.E.2d at 437-38 (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nâ€œPublicity involves disclosure to the public, not just an\r\n  individual or a small group.â€Â  Id. at 641, 494 S.E.2d at 438; see also Swinton\r\n    Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334\r\n  S.C. 469, 478-80, 514 S.E.2d 126, 131 (1999) (noting\r\n  the difference between publicity and publication â€œis one of a communication\r\n  that reaches, or is sure to reach, the publicâ€).Â  Thus, while a confidential\r\n  relationship is breached if unauthorized disclosure is made to an individual not\r\n  a party to the confidence, the right of privacy[6] is not implicated. McCormick, 328 S.C. at 641, 494 S.E.2d at 438.\r\nBased\r\n  upon the foregoing, we find Snavely cannot sustain her claim against Piedmont for invasion of privacy.Â  Here, the record contains no evidence suggesting Dr.\r\n  Zellner or anyone else connected with Piedmont disclosed Snavelyâ€™s condition\r\n  outside the examination room.Â  Consequently, Snavely cannot satisfy the\r\n  publicity requirement of her invasion of privacy claim because Snavely cannot\r\n  prove Piedmont publicized her medical condition to the public at large.Â  Thus,\r\n  the trial court properly granted Piedmont summary judgment on this ground. \r\nBecause we find Dr. Zellner breached no duty, we\r\n  decline to address Snavelyâ€™s remaining argument regarding the ostensible agency\r\n  doctrine established in Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32,\r\n  533 S.E.2d 312 (2000). See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need\r\n  not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).Â Â  \r\nII. Motion to Dismiss\r\nSnavely\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting Dr. Zellnerâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Snavely argues the trial court erred in finding the collateral estoppel doctrine barred the litigation of her claims\r\n  against Dr. Zellner.Â  We disagree. \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note this issue is not properly before us because Snavely failed to serve her\r\n  motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Rules\r\n  5(a) and 59(e), SCRCP.Â  According to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, â€œa motion to alter or\r\n  amend judgment shall be served no later than 10 days after receipt of written\r\n  notice of the entry of the order.â€Â  Rule 5(a), SCRCP, further provides\r\n  all â€œwritten motions . . . shall be served upon each of the parties of record.â€Â  In the present case, Dr. Zellner was never served with\r\n  Snavelyâ€™s motion to alter or amend judgment.[7]Â \r\n  Thus, we decline to rule on this issue. \r\nAdverting\r\n  to the merits, this court set forth the modern\r\n  rule regarding the application of collateral estoppel in Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 370-71, 315 S.E.2d\r\n  186, 190-91 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In addressing the application of collateral\r\n  estoppel, the Beall court held a party precluded from relitigating an\r\n  issue with an opposing party is also precluded from relitigating the same issue\r\n  with a different party unless the precluded party lacked full and fair\r\n  opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action.Â  Id.Â  While\r\n  the traditional use of collateral estoppel required mutuality of parties to bar\r\n  relitigation, modern courts recognize the mutuality requirement is not\r\n  necessary for the application of collateral estoppel where the party against\r\n  whom estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to previously\r\n  litigate the issues.Â  Id.Â  As noted by this court: \r\n\r\n  In the abstract, there is no legitimate reason to permit a defendant\r\n    who has already thoroughly and vigorously litigated an issue and lost the\r\n    opportunity to relitigate the identical question, already once decided, simply\r\n    because he now faces a different plaintiff who for due process reasons could\r\n    not be adversely bound by the prior judgment. The public interest demands an\r\n    end to the litigation of the same issue.Â  Principles of finality, certainty,\r\n    and the proper administration of justice suggest that a decision once rendered\r\n    should stand unless some compelling countervailing consideration necessitates\r\n    relitigation. \r\n\r\nId. at 370, 315 S.E.2d at 190.Â  Thus, the\r\n  primary concern of our courts in applying collateral estoppel is not whether\r\n  the parties satisfy the mutuality requirement, but whether a potentially\r\n  precluded party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in a\r\n  prior action.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the record clearly indicates Snavely had a\r\n  full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues of consent, waiver, and\r\n  comparative negligence in her claim against Piedmont.Â  Therefore, non-mutual\r\n  collateral estoppel was correctly applied, and Snavely was properly barred from\r\n  relitigating these same issues against Dr. Zellner.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court did not err in granting Dr. Zellnerâ€™s motion to dismiss. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in granting both Piedmontâ€™s motion for\r\n  summary judgment and Dr. Zellnerâ€™s motion for dismissal. Â Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nWILLIAMS\r\nand PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] At the time of the incident, Snavely resided with her\r\nbrother, James Brooks (Mr. Brooks), and his wife, Carol Brooks (Mrs. Brooks).Â  \r\n[3] The record contains no evidence suggesting Dr.\r\n  Zellner, or anyone else connected with Snavely, disclosed her condition outside\r\nthe examination room.Â  \r\n[4] It appears there was a falling out between Snavely\r\n  and the Brookses after which Mrs. Brooks allegedly called Snavelyâ€™s employer\r\nand disclosed Snavelyâ€™s condition. \r\n[5] At common law, neither the\r\n  patient nor the physician has the privilege to refuse to disclose in court a\r\n  communication of one to the other, nor does either have a privilege that the\r\n  communication not be disclosed to a third person. 61 Am.Jur.2d Physicians,\r\n    Surgeons, and Other Healers Â§Â§ 148, 169 (1981).Â  Although several states\r\n  have statutorily created a â€œphysician-patient testimonial privilege,â€ South Carolina has not enacted a similar statute and does not recognize the\r\n  physician-patient privilege.Â  See Peagler v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R.\r\n    Co., 232 S.C. 274, 282-83, 101 S.E.2d 821, 825 (1958) (noting statutes have\r\n  been enacted in most states making communications between a physician and\r\n  patient privileged from compulsory disclosure, but there is no such statute in\r\n  South Carolina).Â  However, the absence of a testimonial privilege barring certain\r\n  in-court disclosures is not determinative of our issue because this evidentiary\r\n  privilege is discernible from a duty of confidentiality.Â  As noted by our\r\n  Supreme Court in S.C. State Board of Medical Examiners v. Hedgepath, 325\r\n  S.C. 166, 169, 480 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1997): â€œThe terms â€˜privilegeâ€™ and\r\n  â€˜confidencesâ€™ are not synonymous, and a professionalâ€™s duty to maintain his\r\n  clientâ€™s confidences is independent of the issue whether he can be legally\r\n  compelled to reveal some or all of those confidences, that is, whether those\r\ncommunications are privileged.â€ \r\n[6] As noted by our Supreme\r\n  Court in McCormick:\r\n\r\n  Privacy is a right against the public at large. Its doctrinal\r\n    limits narrowly circumscribe the zone of proscribed conduct in order to prevent\r\n    hindrance of public expression. In contrast, a right to confidentiality exists\r\n    against a specific person, who, by virtue of his relationship to the confider,\r\n    has notice of the duty to preserve the secrecy of clearly identifiable\r\n    information.\r\n\r\n328 S.C. at 641, 494 S.E.2d at 438 (citation omitted). \r\n[7] In her attorney affidavit, Snavelyâ€™s counsel\r\n  explained the motion to alter and amend judgment was not properly served on Dr.\r\nZellner due to â€œinadvertence and excusable mistake.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4414","title":"Johnson v.

Renfrow, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCURETON, A. J.:Â  In this action seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits for a\r\n  work-related eye injury, Macksey Johnson appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  affirming an award of benefits for an 8.5% loss of vision.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 31, 2001, a tree limb struck Macksey Johnsonâ€™s right eye\r\n  while he was working for Beauty Unlimited Landscaping (Beauty Unlimited).Â  As a\r\n  result of that injury, Johnson developed a traumatic cataract in that eye.Â  Dr.\r\n  Karen Ullian, a general ophthalmologist, surgically removed the cataract and\r\n  implanted an artificial lens.Â  Johnson returned to work in September of 2001.Â \r\n  One month later, Dr. Ullian recorded that the intraocular implant had restored Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  vision in his right eye to 20/20.Â Â Â  \r\nDr. Ullian testified in March of 2005 Johnson had 20/30 vision in\r\n  his right eye, but glasses corrected this vision to 20/20.Â  When Johnson\r\n  complained of seeing â€œfloatersâ€ in February of 2005, Dr. Ullian examined him.Â \r\n  She determined the floating visual disruptions were benign and would eventually\r\n  go away.Â  Dr. Ullian considered the intraocular implant to be a corrective\r\n  measure comparable to glasses or contact lenses.Â  However, according to Dr.\r\n  Ullian, the implant is a permanent solution to Johnsonâ€™s injury.Â  She testified\r\n  the only maintenance the implant would ever require was an annual eye exam.Â \r\n  Dr. Ullian confidently stated, â€œHe will never need an implant replacement[;]\r\n  that implant is perfect.â€Â  Moreover, as a result of the implant, Dr. Ullian\r\n  testified Johnson â€œha[d] no disability.â€Â Â Â  \r\nJohnson filed a Form 50 with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission)\r\n  seeking compensation for 100% loss of use of his right eye.[2]Â  The single commissioner found\r\n  Johnsonâ€™s eye injury was compensable and ordered Beauty Unlimited to pay all\r\n  approved medical bills related to treatment for this injury through February\r\n  16, 2005, the date Johnson reached maximum medical improvement.Â  However, the single\r\n  commissioner declined to characterize the intraocular implant as a â€œcorrective\r\n  lensâ€ and awarded Johnson only an 18.5% permanent partial disability for the loss\r\n  of vision in his right eye.Â  Both parties appealed.Â Â Â  \r\nThe appellate panel affirmed the single commissioner with some\r\n  modifications.Â  The appellate panel reduced the 18.5% loss of vision to 8.5% based\r\n  upon correction of Johnsonâ€™s 20/30 vision to 20/20.[3]Â  Furthermore, the appellate panel\r\n  held the word â€œuseâ€ in the applicable regulation must necessarily indicate a\r\n  removable corrective appliance like glasses or contact lenses.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the appellate panel.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing workersâ€™ compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains â€œwhether\r\n  the circuit court properly determined whether the appellate panelâ€™s findings of\r\n  fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the\r\n  panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.â€ Â Baxter v.

Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007).Â  Generally, â€œâ€˜[c]ourts\r\n  defer to the relevant administrative agencyâ€™s decisions with respect to its own\r\n  regulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.â€™â€Â  Neal v.

S.C.\r\n  Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414\r\n  (2002)) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Regulation 67-1105\r\nJohnson\r\n  first argues the circuit court erred in interpreting regulation 67-1105[4] to exclude compensation for the 100% loss of vision in his eye.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA\r\n  disability is an â€œincapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the\r\n  employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other\r\n  employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-120 (1985).Â  An employer must pay an injured\r\n  employee compensation for partial disability.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 to -30\r\n  (1985 &amp; Supp. 2007).Â  The loss of an eye results in a compensable partial\r\n  disability.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(18) (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œLoss of vision is\r\n  based on reading without the use of corrective lenses.â€Â  S.C. Code Regs. Â§&nbsp;67-1105\r\n  (1989).Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court properly determined the appellate panel committed no error of\r\n  law.Â  Under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (Act), a work-related injury is\r\n  compensable above and beyond the cost of treatment to the extent it renders the\r\n  employee disabled.Â  See Â§Â§ 42-9-20 to -30.Â  From this premise it follows\r\n  that when treatment restores the employee to his pre-injury condition so he no\r\n  longer requires assistive devices to compensate for his loss, the employee is\r\n  no longer disabled.Â  Only a disabled employee is eligible for additional workersâ€™\r\n  compensation benefits.Â  In Dr. Ullianâ€™s opinion, Johnson was no longer disabled\r\n  after the implant surgery.Â  However, he did wear glasses to correct the 20/30\r\n  vision in his right eye.Â  No other medical testimony was offered.Â  In light of\r\n  these facts, the appellate panel affirmed an award of disability benefits\r\n  appropriate to Johnsonâ€™s 20/30 vision.Â  Consequently, we find the circuit court\r\n  did not err in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s award.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  see no compelling reason to depart from the appellate panelâ€™s ruling that the\r\n  term â€œcorrective lensesâ€ does not include implanted lenses.[5] Â While we agree with Dr. Ullian that an intraocular implant is corrective in\r\n  nature, we find it is not a â€œcorrective lensâ€ as contemplated by regulation\r\n  67-1105.Â  In affirming the appellate panel, the circuit court reasoned:\r\n\r\n\tClearly,\r\n  there is a distinct difference between a removable glass or plastic lens, which\r\n  must be replaced or removed periodically, and a complex invasive surgery that\r\n  permanently restructures and repairs oneâ€™s vision.Â  An intra-ocular lens\r\n  implant . . . is an intricate surgery that rebuilds the inner-workings of the\r\n  eye, whereby the patient is able to permanently recover his or her vision to a\r\n  degree often greater than that prior to injury.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find an intraocular\r\n  implant differs significantly from both glasses and contact lenses in terms of\r\n  the permanence of the solution and the requirement of future maintenance.Â  With\r\n  regard to permanence, a person may wear or remove glasses or contact lenses at\r\n  will.Â  However, an intraocular implant resides wholly within the patientâ€™s eye\r\n  and is inaccessible without surgery.Â  Furthermore, according to Dr. Ullian, the intraocular\r\n  implant will last the rest of Johnsonâ€™s life.Â  In light of these facts, we do not believe Johnsonâ€™s current â€œloss of\r\n  visionâ€ without the use of his implanted lens could be determined without\r\n  surgically removing his implant.Â  See S.C. Code Regs. Â§&nbsp;67-1105\r\n  (1989).Â  With regard to future maintenance, common knowledge dictates that both\r\n  glasses and contact lenses frequently require replacement because they become\r\n  lost, break, or, more commonly in the case of contact lenses, wear out.Â  Periodic\r\n  vision examinations and new prescriptions render old glasses and contact lenses\r\n  obsolete.Â  In addition, as Dr. Ullian observed, contact lenses expose the\r\n  wearer to the risk of eye infections.Â  Â Â \r\nBy contrast, Johnsonâ€™s implant will never need replacement and\r\n  does not regularly expose his eye to infections.Â  His vision without the use of\r\n  contact lenses or eyeglasses has been measured at 20/30.Â  He need only wear\r\n  glasses to perfect his vision, which is already quite good.Â  However, Johnson\r\n  received an award of workersâ€™ compensation benefits for the percentage of his\r\n  vision the glasses restore.Â  Because we concur with the appellate panelâ€™s\r\n  reasoning in distinguishing an intraocular implant from the â€œcorrective lensesâ€\r\n  contemplated in the regulation, we defer to the agencyâ€™s expertise and ruling\r\n  in this matter.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Interpretation of\r\n  Regulation\r\nJohnson\r\n  next argues the circuit court erred in failing to interpret the regulation in\r\n  the light most favorable to the claimant.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œWorkersâ€™\r\n  compensation laws were intended by the Legislature to relieve workers of the\r\n  uncertainties of a trial for damages by providing sure, swift recovery for\r\n  workplace injuries regardless of fault.â€ Â Peay v. U.S. Silica Co., 313\r\n  S.C. 91, 94, 437 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1993).Â  On appeal from a decision of the appellate\r\n  panel, a court must â€œreview the evidence, and state the facts and the\r\n  reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to claimant.â€ Â Ford\r\n    v. Allied Chem. Corp., 252 S.C. 561, 564, 167 S.E.2d 564, 565 (1969).Â  â€œAny\r\n  reasonable doubts as to construction of the Act should be resolved in favor of\r\n  coverage.â€Â  Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 22, 416\r\n  S.E.2d 639, 641 (1992).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not err in affirming the appellate panel.Â  The role of the\r\n  courts is to evaluate the evidence â€œin the light most favorable to claimantâ€ to\r\n  ensure injured employees do not bear the cost of disabilities resulting from\r\n  work-related hazards. Â This role does not empower the courts to employ\r\n  semantics to stretch the Act or its attendant regulations and extend benefits\r\n  to persons who no longer suffer a disability.Â  See Santee Cooper\r\n    Resort, Inc. v.

Commâ€™n, 298 S.C. 179, 184, 379 S.E.2d 119,\r\n  122 (1989).Â  The Commission found Johnson suffered a work-related disability\r\n  and ordered his employer to fund his medical treatment.Â  No evidence suggests\r\n  his employer failed to pay for his treatment.Â  But for a small diminution in\r\n  vision, the medical treatment he received eliminated the disability.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find Johnson has recuperated without bearing the cost of his recovery.Â  Permitting\r\n  him to recover simultaneously for wholly successful medical treatment and for a\r\n  100% disability that no longer exists would create an unreasonable windfall for\r\n  Johnson.Â  The Act has served its purpose by ensuring coverage for Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  â€œsure, swift recoveryâ€ from injury and by providing for his future vision-care\r\n  needs in accordance with the actual diminution in vision he has experienced.Â  Peay,\r\n  313 S.C. at 95, 437 S.E.2d at 65.Â  Accordingly, we see no error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find no error of law in the appellate panelâ€™s decision to exclude an\r\n  intraocular implant from the term â€œcorrective lensesâ€ in regulation 67-1105.Â  For\r\n  this reason, the circuit court did not err in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s\r\n  decision.Â  Furthermore, we find the appellate panel committed no error in\r\n  evaluating the evidence or interpreting the law in this matter, and thus, its\r\n  decision is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Consequently, the circuit court\r\n  did not err in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s decision.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  order of the circuit court in this matter is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Johnson subsequently developed a cataract in his left\r\n  eye, but Dr. Ullian believed it was unrelated to the right-eye injury.Â  Johnson\r\n  made no claim for his left eye.Â  \r\n[3] According to the Snellen Notation table, 20/30 vision\r\n  corresponds with an 8.5% loss of vision.Â  25A S.C.

Unrue), approached Elizabeth about managing these funds.Â  At the time, Karen was the owner of an accounting\r\n  business, Carolina Bookkeeping, and held herself out as knowledgeable regarding\r\n  investments.Â  Karen told Elizabeth that the investment firm of Charles Schwab,\r\n  where Elizabeth had already invested a portion of the funds, would cheat her\r\n  out of her money.Â  Ultimately, Elizabeth began to rely on Karen for investment\r\n  advice, and between February 21 and May 1 of 2001, Elizabeth transferred\r\n  $274,191 to Karen for investment.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  March 29, 2001 order of the probate court of Williamsburg County, Karen and her\r\n  brother, Travis Powell, were appointed co-conservators for the estate of Cody.Â \r\n  Under the probate court order, the funds were to be deposited in a restricted\r\n  account, and no funds were to be withdrawn or transferred without written order\r\n  of the probate court.Â  The probate court also prohibited Karen and Travis from\r\n  compensating themselves out of Codyâ€™s funds.Â  \r\nCodyâ€™s funds were\r\n  never placed in a restricted account.Â  Karen deposited Codyâ€™s funds into her\r\n  checking account at the Bank, and subsequently placed them into certificates of\r\n  deposit (CDs) with the Bank in her name.Â  As each CD matured, the money was\r\n  re-deposited into Karenâ€™s personal checking account, and by September 2001, all\r\n  of the funds had been withdrawn from the CDs and placed into Karenâ€™s personal\r\n  account.Â  \r\nKaren\r\n  and her husband moved to Colorado in 2001.Â  By the end of November 2001, Karen\r\n  had removed $355,000 from her checking account at the Bank and deposited the\r\n  funds in an account with Vectra Bank in Colorado in the names of Karen, Travis,\r\n  and Elizabeth.Â  Elizabeth was unaware of this account.Â  While in Colorado, Karen withdrew the funds for her own personal use.Â  On several occasions, Elizabeth contacted Karen through a phone booth in Colorado requesting an accounting of\r\n  the funds.Â  While Karen did make several small payments at the request of Elizabeth, Karen failed to provide an accounting of the funds or to return the funds to\r\n  Cody and Elizabeth.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 30, 2002, Elizabeth filed a complaint against Karen for conversion of the\r\n  funds. Â The same day, Karen forwarded a check in the amount of $194,637.97\r\n  drawn from the account at Vectra Bank to a South Carolina attorney, who placed\r\n  the funds in escrow.Â  In June 2004, Elizabeth secured a judgment in her action\r\n  against Karen in the amount of $249,733.39 actual damages and $750,000 punitive\r\n  damages.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 2, 2003, Cody, through his conservator, Kelly H. Kelley, and his mother,\r\n  Elizabeth, filed suit against the Bank, Travis, and Karen to recover his\r\n  funds.Â  The Bank and Travis appeared and filed answers denying liability.Â \r\n  Karen, however, did not respond and was held in default.Â Â Â  \r\nBy\r\n  consent order filed November 21, 2003, the parties in Codyâ€™s action agreed for\r\n  all funds in the escrow account to be deposited in an interest-bearing account\r\n  with the clerk of court for Williamsburg County.Â  Subsequently, on June 16,\r\n  2004, Elizabeth joined the case as a defendant-intervenor pursuant to Rule\r\n  24(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  \r\nJudge\r\n  Howard P. King issued a scheduling order in Codyâ€™s case on December 30, 2004,\r\n  which set March 1, 2005, as the deadline for completion of discovery.Â \r\n  Subsequent to the discovery deadline, the Bank filed a motion to sever Elizabethâ€™s equitable action pursuant to Rule 42, SCRCP.Â  The Bankâ€™s motion, dated May 12,\r\n  2005, asserted five grounds to justify its request for severance:Â  \r\n\r\n  (1) Codyâ€™s claims against the Bank are â€œentirely\r\n    separate and have no relation to the issue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [of] what portion of\r\n    the escrowed funds belongs to [Cody] and what portion belongs to [Elizabeth].â€Â  \r\n  (2) â€œ[D]eciding the ownership of such funds furthers\r\n    the important interests of judicial economy for all parties, counsel and the\r\n    Courtâ€ because Elizabeth â€œwill not have to actively participate in the trial of\r\n    the primary claims[.]â€Â  \r\n  (3) â€œ[S]evering this issue from the first-party action\r\n    also serves the best interest of [Cody]. . . .Â  If the Court agrees with [the\r\n    Bankâ€™s expert], [Cody] will receive over $150,000 in cash before trial . . .\r\n    which is patently to his benefit.â€Â  \r\n  (4) â€œ[S]everance of this claim will benefit all parties to this action.Â  [Elizabeth] will receive her interest of the escrowed\r\n    funds and will not have to incur additional attorneysâ€™ fees, costs and\r\n    inconvenience associated with the trial of this case.â€Â  \r\n  (5) The Bank â€œwill know [its] liability before\r\n    trial.â€Â  (Emphasis in original.)Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Bankâ€™s motion to sever was heard by Judge Thomas W. Cooper, Jr.Â Â  Judge Cooper\r\n  granted the severance motion by order dated July 25, 2005.Â  Judge Cooperâ€™s\r\n  reasoning tracked the grounds asserted in the Bankâ€™s May 12 motion, as the\r\n  order emphasized factors such as convenience of parties, convenience of\r\n  witnesses, judicial economy, and the â€œseparateâ€ and â€œindependentâ€ nature of\r\n  Codyâ€™s legal claims and Elizabethâ€™s â€œequitable claim as to a portion of the\r\n  escrowed funds.â€Â  At the hearing before Judge Cooper, the Bank acknowledged\r\n  that neither the Bank â€œnor any of the\r\n  co-conservators or anyone else is claiming any ownership of those funds.&nbsp;\r\n  Itâ€™s only how much belongs to [Cody and] how much belongs to [Elizabeth].&nbsp;\r\n  Thatâ€™s it.â€&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nThe\r\n  hearing to apportion the escrowed funds was scheduled to begin December 20,\r\n  2005 before Judge King.Â  According to the record, Cody and Elizabeth reached an\r\n  agreement on the eve of the hearing concerning the apportionment of the\r\n  escrowed funds.Â  Subject to court review and approval, Cody and Elizabeth\r\n  agreed to apportion the funds 56% to 44%, respectively.Â  The Bank objected to\r\n  the settlement as it, in hopes of minimizing Codyâ€™s ultimate damage claim,\r\n  advocated for Cody receiving a greater share of the funds. Elizabeth contended\r\n  that the Bank did not have an interest in the funds, noting that she and Cody\r\n  â€œhave an absolute unfettered right to settle.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  issue of apportionment of the funds proceeded to a contested hearing, with the\r\n  Bank taking a prominent role ostensibly on Codyâ€™s behalf.Â  Judge King\r\n  apportioned the funds, which then totaled $197,596.44, giving 56% to Cody ($110,654)\r\n  and 44% to Elizabeth ($86,942.44), the same as the settlement agreement.Â  The\r\n  cross-appeals followed.Â \r\nII.\r\nAPPEAL OF ELIZABETH POWELL \r\nElizabeth argues the Bank has no interest in the subject matter\r\n  of the apportionment of the escrowed funds.Â  We agree and dismiss the Bankâ€™s\r\n  appeal.\r\nWe conclude the Bank has no interest in the subject matter of the apportionment of the escrowed\r\n  funds and therefore lacks standing.Â  As a consequence of its lack of interest\r\n  in the escrowed funds, the Bank is not an aggrieved party under Rule 201 of the\r\n  South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.Â  The Bank is a party only to Codyâ€™s\r\n  underlying damage claims.Â  The Bank has never been a party to the severed\r\n  equitable claim of Elizabeth.Â  As Judge Cooper correctly noted in severing the\r\n  legal and equitable claims, â€œ[t]here is no overlapping evidence in these two separate cases brought by separate parties.â€Â  (Second emphasis\r\n  added.)Â  \r\nStanding\r\n  refers to a â€œ[a] partyâ€™s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial\r\n  enforcement of a duty or right.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1413 (7th ed.\r\n  1999).Â  â€œStanding is . . . that concept of justiciability that is concerned\r\n  with whether a particular person may raise legal arguments or claims.â€Â  1A\r\n  C.J.S. Actions Â§ 101 (2005).Â  It concerns an individualâ€™s â€œsufficient\r\n  interest in the outcome of the litigation to warrant consideration of [the personâ€™s]\r\n  position by a court.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nStanding\r\n  is comprised of three elements:\r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    the plaintiff must have suffered an â€œinjury in factâ€â€”an invasion of a legally\r\n    protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) â€œactual or\r\n    imminent, not â€˜conjecturalâ€™ or â€˜hypothetical.â€™ â€Â  Second, there must be a\r\n    causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained ofâ€”the injury has to be\r\n    â€œfairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not .\r\n    . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the\r\n    court.â€Â  Third, it must be â€œlikely,â€ as opposed to merely â€œspeculative,â€ that\r\n    the injury will be â€œredressed by a favorable decision.â€\r\n\r\nSmiley v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health\r\n    &amp; Envtâ€™l Control,&nbsp; 374 S.C.\r\n  326, 329, 649 S.E.2d 31, 32-33&nbsp;(2007) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders\r\n    of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992) (alteration in original)).Â  â€œThe party seeking to establish standing\r\n  carries the burden of demonstrating each of the three elements.â€Â  Sea Pines\r\n    Assâ€™n for the Protection of Wildlife, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural\r\n    Res., 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291&nbsp;(2001).\r\nâ€œAs\r\n  a general rule, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal stake in the\r\n  subject matter of the litigation.â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62,\r\n  624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œOne must be a real party in interest, i.e.,\r\n  a party who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter\r\n  of the action, as opposed to one who has only a nominal or technical interest\r\n  in the action.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Bank admits it has no ownership interest in the interpleaded funds.Â  The Bank\r\n  posits two grounds to support its claim of standing: (1) it is in Codyâ€™s best\r\n  interest to receive all of the interpleaded funds; and (2) by allocating all of\r\n  the interpleaded funds to Cody, the Bank reduces Codyâ€™s damages, thereby\r\n  reducing the Bankâ€™s potential liability.\r\nFirst,\r\n  we reject as transparently thin the Bankâ€™s argument that it is seeking to\r\n  protect Codyâ€™s best interest.Â  We are unaware of any law (and the Bank has\r\n  cited none) supporting the idea that one party may acquire standing by\r\n  asserting the interest of an adverse party.Â  The familiar principle that courts\r\n  must zealously guard the rights of minors certainly does not give the Bank a pass\r\n  on standing requirements.Â  Second, while we understand the Bankâ€™s desire to\r\n  limit its potential exposure in Codyâ€™s underlying action, this practical\r\n  concern falls far short of the â€œinjury in factâ€ standing requirement.Â  Not\r\n  every practical concern equates to the legal interest required for standing.Â \r\n  The Bank denies any liability to Cody, and its interest in maximizing Codyâ€™s\r\n  share of the interpleaded funds is therefore speculative and contingent.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find instructive the supreme courtâ€™s recent decision in Ex Parte Government\r\n    Employeeâ€™s Insurance Co., 373 S.C. 132, 644 S.E.2d 699 (2007), in which the\r\n  court addressed the sufficiency of a partyâ€™s potential liability in relation to\r\n  joinder and standing.Â  Ronnie Cooper was injured in a motor vehicle accident.Â  Id. at 134, 644 S.E.2d at 700.Â  Cooper, claiming the status of a Class I insured,\r\n  sought to stack underinsured motorist coverage provided by Government\r\n  Employeeâ€™s Insurance Co. (GEICO) to Yolanda Goethe.Â  Id.Â  According to\r\n  Cooper, he and Goethe had a common law marriage.Â  Id.Â  GEICO denied the\r\n  common law marriage claim and Cooperâ€™s stacking claim.Â  Id.Â  GEICO\r\n  brought a declaratory judgment action against Cooper to determine the partiesâ€™\r\n  rights pursuant to the policy issued to Goethe.Â  Id.Â  Cooper responded\r\n  by filing a family court action seeking an order recognizing the purported\r\n  common law marriage.Â  Id.Â  Because the family courtâ€™s decision on the\r\n  common law marriage issue would impact GEICOâ€™s ability to protect its interest\r\n  in the circuit court declaratory judgment action, GIECO moved to join the\r\n  family court action.Â  Id. at 134-35, 644 S.E.2d at 700.\r\nFinding\r\n  that GEICO was not a necessary party for joinder and did not have standing to\r\n  intervene, the family court denied GEICOâ€™s motion.Â  Id. at 135, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  at 700.Â  The supreme court affirmed, referring to GEICOâ€™s interest in the\r\n  common law marriage determination as â€œinsufficient,â€ â€œmerely tangential,â€ and\r\n  â€œmerely peripheral.â€ Id. at 136-37, 644 S.E.2d at 701-02.Â  The supreme\r\n  court, while well aware that â€œthe existence of a common law marriage may impact\r\n  GEICOâ€™s liability to Cooper,â€ id. at 136, 644 S.E.2d at 701, concluded\r\n  that â€œGEICOâ€™s interest is in the financial implications of the family\r\n  courtâ€™s decision, which is peripheral to the subject matter before the court.â€Â  Id. at 138-39, 644 S.E.2d at 702 (emphasis added).\r\nGEICO\r\n  presented a stronger case for standing than does the Bank.Â  The Bankâ€™s interest\r\n  in the allocation of the interpleaded funds falls far short of conferring\r\n  standing.Â  The Bankâ€™s potential and speculative liability to Cody is tangential\r\n  and peripheral to the precise allocation of the interpleaded funds between Cody\r\n  and Elizabeth.Â  As with GEICO, the Bankâ€™s interest is merely in the â€œfinancial\r\n  implicationsâ€ of the trial courtâ€™s decision allocating the interpleaded funds.\r\nWe\r\n  now turn to Elizabethâ€™s specific assignments of error concerning the Bankâ€™s\r\n  lack of standing.Â  Elizabeth first claims the trial court erred in allowing the\r\n  Bank to prevent her and Cody from settling the matter of the allocation of\r\n  escrowed funds.Â  As noted, Elizabeth and Cody reached an agreement concerning\r\n  their respective ownership interest of the funds.Â  When the Bank objected to\r\n  the proposed settlement, Elizabeth challenged the Bankâ€™s standing to do so.Â \r\n  The trial court erred.Â  Yet the error, by itself, would not warrant reversal,\r\n  for the trial court ultimately apportioned the funds in the same manner as the\r\n  parties had proposed in their settlement.Â  Consequently, Elizabeth was not\r\n  prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Brown v. Pearson,\r\n  326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating â€œ[a]n error not\r\n  shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversalâ€); McCall\r\n    v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987) (â€œAppellate\r\n  courts recognize . . . an overriding rule of civil procedure which says:Â \r\n  whatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t matter.â€).Â  \r\nElizabeth finally challenges the Bankâ€™s status as an â€œaggrieved\r\n  partyâ€ for appeal purposes.Â  There is no\r\n  material distinction in general standing principles juxtaposed to the ability\r\n  of an â€œaggrieved partyâ€ to appeal pursuant to Rule 201(b) of the South Carolina\r\n  Appellate Court Rules.Â  See Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort County,&nbsp;346\r\n  S.C. 298, 301-03, 551 S.E.2d 588-89, 589&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (conducting an\r\n  analysis under both Rule 201 and general standing principles in addressing\r\n  whether a party had standing to appeal). \r\nIn\r\n  considering the Bankâ€™s ability to appeal from the order apportioning the\r\n  escrowed funds, the Bank is neither a â€œpartyâ€ nor â€œaggrieved.â€Â  As noted\r\n  earlier, the Bank has never been a party to the severed equitable action.Â \r\n  Judge Cooper specifically stated in his order granting the motion for a\r\n  severance that this matter involves â€œtwo separate cases brought by separate\r\n  parties.â€Â  In addition, Elizabethâ€™s counsel pointed out at a subsequent hearing\r\n  that the Bank was never made a party to the equitable action.Â  \r\nRule\r\n  201(b) limits the ability to appeal to â€œ[o]nly a party aggrieved by an order,\r\n  judgment . . . or decision . . . .â€Â  Rule 201(b), SCACR.Â  This court has\r\n  previously explained that under Rule 201(b), â€œ[t]he word â€˜aggrievedâ€™ refers to\r\n  a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right, or the\r\n  imposition on a party of a burden or obligation.â€Â  Beaufort Realty Co.,\r\n  346 S.C. at 301, 551 S.E.2d at 589.Â  â€œA party is aggrieved by a judgment or\r\n  decree when it operates on his or her rights of property or bears directly on\r\n  his or her interest.â€Â  Id.Â  In light of Ex Parte Government\r\n    Employeeâ€™s Insurance Co., the Bank may not properly claim that the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s apportionment of the escrowed funds affects its property rights or\r\n  otherwise bears on its interest.\r\nBecause\r\n  the Bank has no interest in the escrowed funds, the Bank is not aggrieved by\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s apportionment of the funds between Cody and Elizabeth.Â  We\r\n  dismiss the Bankâ€™s appeal.Â  \r\nElizabeth conceded at oral argument that the dismissal of the\r\n  Bankâ€™s appeal renders the balance of her appeal moot.Â  We therefore decline to\r\n  address the balance of her appeal.\r\nAPPEAL\r\n  DISMISSED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4416","title":"Olson v.

Sims, was not a joint-use permit for Simsâ€™ lot 55 and the\r\n  Olsonsâ€™ lot 56.Â  The Olsons also appeal the denial by OCRM of an independent\r\n  permit for a dock from their property to the Intracoastal Waterway.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe\r\n  Olsons own lot 56 in the Romain Retreat subdivision.Â  Sims is the owner of lot\r\n  55, which is adjacent to the Olsonsâ€™ property.Â  John McCown owns lot 54, which\r\n  is adjacent to Simsâ€™ lot 55.Â  Molly Ball is the owner of lot 61, located across\r\n  a drainage ditch easement from the Olsons.Â  The Olsonsâ€™ property is situated\r\n  such that the extension of their property lines result in their lot bordering\r\n  the drainage ditch, across from which is the backyard of the Ball property. [1]Â \r\n  The Ball property lines extend out over a marsh and toward the Intracoastal Waterway, as do the Sims and McCown properties.[2]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Olsonsâ€™ lot was previously owned by Ann Graves, and the Sims lot was previously\r\n  owned by Annâ€™s son, Stephen Graves.Â  In 1996, William Blume entered into two\r\n  contracts to purchase lot 55 and lot 56 from Stephen Graves and Ann Graves.Â \r\n  Prior to finalizing the purchase, Blume applied for a permit for a dock located\r\n  on lot 55, noting the property was under contract to purchase.Â  On July 3,\r\n  1997, OCRM issued a permit to Blume, but included with the permit the special\r\n  condition that â€œthis is the only dock permitted for lots 55 &amp; 56.â€Â  Prior\r\n  to issuance of the permit, in April 1997, Blume informed Ann and Stephen Graves\r\n  he was exercising his right to terminate the contract as he was unable to\r\n  obtain a dock permit that was satisfactory to him.[3]Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, on July 8, 1997, Stephen Graves applied for a permit to\r\n  construct a private dock from lot 55.Â  On August 25, 1997, OCRM issued the\r\n  permit, which again included the special condition that it was the â€œonly dock\r\n  permitted for lots 55 and 56.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1998, Sims purchased lot 55 from Stephen Graves. Â In 2001, the Olsons purchased\r\n  lot 56 from Ann Graves.Â  In August, 2002, Stephen Graves transferred his dock\r\n  permit to Sims.Â  After discovering the Sims property was being surveyed for the\r\n  construction of a dock, the Olson family approached Sims about the possibility\r\n  of a joint-use dock with Sims, which Sims declined.Â  In October 2003, Sims and\r\n  McCown, who held his own permit for a private dock on his lot 54, applied for\r\n  an amended permit allowing the two landowners to build one walkway down their\r\n  property line leading to two pier heads.Â  OCRM approved the amended permit for\r\n  Sims and McCown in February 2004.Â  In March 2004, the Olsons appealed the\r\n  approval of the Sims/McCown amended permit for a joint-use dock and requested a\r\n  contested hearing before the ALC.Â  Thereafter, the Olsons submitted an\r\n  application for their own private dock from lot 56 to the Intracoastal Waterway.Â \r\n  On September 3, 2004, OCRM denied the Olsonsâ€™ permit application.Â  The Olsons\r\n  challenged this decision by OCRM as well, and the two matters were consolidated\r\n  for consideration by the ALC.\r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing on the matter, the ALC judge issued his order concluding the Olsonsâ€™\r\n  permit was properly denied and the Sims/McCown joint-use permit was properly\r\n  issued.Â  Specifically, the judge affirmed the denial of the Olsonsâ€™ permit\r\n  based on (1) the impact the proposed Olson dock would have on the adjacent\r\n  property ownersâ€™ value and enjoyment and (2)Â  â€œthe extent to which long-range,\r\n  cumulative effects of the project may result within the context of other\r\n  possible development and the general character of the area.â€Â  He further\r\n  determined, based on the evidence before him, the permit originally issued to\r\n  Stephen Graves did not create a joint dock permit for lot 55 and lot 56.Â  The\r\n  ALC judge also concluded the Olsonsâ€™ due process rights were not violated, and\r\n  found no deprivation of the Olsonsâ€™ equal protection rights as well.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed. [4] \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  contested permitting cases, the ALC serves as the finder of fact.Â  Neal v.\r\n    Brown, 374 S.C. 641, 648, 649 S.E.2d 164, 167 (Ct. App. 2007); Brown v.\r\n      S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d\r\n  410, 417 (2002).Â  Judicial review of the ALC judgeâ€™s order is governed by\r\n  section 1-23-610(C) of the South Carolina Code which provides as follows: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order must be confined to the record.Â \r\n    The reviewing tribunal may affirm the decision or remand the case for further\r\n    proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights\r\n    of the petitioner has (sic) been prejudiced because of (sic) the finding,\r\n    conclusion, or decision is:\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a)\r\n      in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b)\r\n      in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c)\r\n      made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (d)\r\n      affected by other error of law;\r\n  \r\n    (e)\r\n      clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n      on the whole record;Â  or\r\n    (f)\r\n      arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n      unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  Thus, this court can reverse the ALC if the findings are affected\r\n  by error of law, are not supported by substantial evidence, or are characterized\r\n  by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.Â  The ALCâ€™s\r\n  findings are supported by substantial evidence if, looking at the record as a\r\n  whole, there is evidence from which reasonable minds could reach the same\r\n  conclusion the administrative agency reached.Â  Neal, 374 S.C. at 648,\r\n  649 S.E.2d at 167.Â  The mere\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent a finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  DuRant v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704,\r\n  707 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Joint Dock Permit\r\nThe Olsons first\r\n  argue the ALC erred in finding the permit issued to Graves did not create a\r\n  joint dock permit for lots 55 and 56.Â  In particular, the Olsons point to\r\n  evidence that the dock permit in question contained the provision that it was\r\n  the only permit for lots 55 and 56, and that one of OCRMâ€™s internal documents\r\n  on the application noted the permit type as â€œjoint.â€Â  We find substantial\r\n  evidence in the record supports the ALC decision.\r\nWhile the\r\n  application by Stephen Graves did result in a notation on the Agencyâ€™s DBASE IV\r\n  information sheet that the â€œPermit Typeâ€ was â€œjoint,â€ Richard Chinnis, director\r\n  of regulatory programs with OCRM, explained this language did not indicate it\r\n  was an application for a joint-use permit, but designated it was a joint\r\n  application with OCRM and the Corps of Engineers.Â  We find absolutely no merit\r\n  to the Olsonsâ€™ assertion that Chinnis did not participate in the Blume or\r\n  Graves permitting process and therefore did not â€œunderstand the dynamics of the\r\n  whole processâ€ sufficient enough to accurately describe the meaning of the\r\n  condition or the notes in the file.Â  The record clearly reflects Chinnis\r\n  participated in the permitting decision for both the Blume and Graves applications.Â  Further, the Olsons called Chinnis as their own witness, and it was\r\n  the Olsons who elicited information on the meaning of the term â€œjointâ€ in the\r\n  internal document from Chinnis.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the special condition of the permit providing â€œthis is the only dock\r\n  permitted for lots 55 and 56,â€ we find this language insufficient to transform\r\n  the permit into a joint-use permit for lots 55 and 56.Â  Chinnis testified the\r\n  condition was placed on the Blume permit because at the time Blume was in the\r\n  process of acquiring both lots 55 and 56, and this was a notice to him that he\r\n  need not apply for a dock permit for lot 56 as one would not be issued.Â \r\n  Chinnis further stated he was under the assumption that Stephen Graves owned\r\n  both lots 55 and 56 when he applied for the dock permit, and looking at it as\r\n  they did the Blume application with one owner of both lots, the special\r\n  condition was an advisement to the applicant that lot 56 was not going to\r\n  receive a dock permit.Â  Chinnis indicated there was never any mention nor\r\n  documentation of any agreement between Stephen Graves and Ann Graves for a\r\n  joint-use dock.[5]Â \r\n  As noted above, we find no merit to the Olsonsâ€™ assertion that Chinnis lacked\r\n  knowledge on the subject.\r\nFurther,\r\n  the evidence here clearly shows the dock permit for lot 55 issued to Stephen\r\n  Graves and subsequently transferred to Sims did not include the owner of lot 56\r\n  as an applicant.Â  Rather, the application shows a single-use permit for a\r\n  private dock was sought for lot 55, with no mention of a joint-use dock.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Additionally,\r\n  the property identified on the application corresponded with the property\r\n  description of lot 55 and the application clearly shows the dock was solely\r\n  located within the boundaries of lot 55.Â  The public notice for the Graves\r\n  permit application made no reference to any joint-use dock for lots 55 and 56,\r\n  but indicated only it was for construction of a private dock located at lot\r\n  55.Â  The permit issued to Stephen Graves by OCRM stated the purpose of the\r\n  permit was â€œfor the property ownerâ€™s private recreational use.â€Â  Accordingly,\r\n  substantial evidence exists to support the ALC judgeâ€™s decision that no\r\n  joint-use dock permit existed for lot 55 and 56.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  as noted by the ALC judge, there is no evidence the Olsons have secured any\r\n  easement rights to cross Simsâ€™ property to reach the dock located on lot 55.Â \r\n  In fact, the Olsons admitted they had no written agreement for a joint-use dock\r\n  with Sims, nor an easement across Simsâ€™ property. Â Issuance of a joint-use\r\n  permit for lots 55 and 56 by OCRM could not convey any right for the owners of\r\n  lot 56 to cross the land of lot 55.Â  See 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§\r\n  30-4(E) (Supp. 2007) (â€œNo permit shall convey, nor be interpreted to convey, a\r\n  property right in the land or water in which the permitted activity is\r\n  located.â€).Â  Thus, the Olsons would have no access to the dock as originally\r\n  permitted from the Graves application.Â  This lack of access further indicates\r\n  the Graves permit was not a joint-use permit for lots 55 and 56. \r\nII.Â  Independent Dock\r\n  Permit\r\nThe Olsons next\r\n  maintain lot 56 is entitled to its own dock and their application should have\r\n  resulted in the issuance of a permit.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn asserting\r\n  their right to an independent dock permit, the Olsons challenge several of the\r\n  bases cited by OCRM in its letter denying the Olsons permit request.Â  However,\r\n  this court is concerned with whether\r\n  the ALC judgeâ€™s decision was supported by substantial evidence.Â  While the ALC\r\n  judge agreed with the Olsons that several of OCRMâ€™s reasons were insufficient\r\n  as a basis for denial, he concluded that there were two separate bases which\r\n  warranted denial of the permit.Â  We find substantial evidence in the record to\r\nsupport the ALC judgeâ€™s decision.\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether to approve or deny a permit application the Department is\r\n  to base its decision on the individual merits of each application, the policies\r\n  specified in South Carolina Code sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30, and specified\r\n  statutory general considerations, including â€œ[t]he extent to which the proposed\r\n  use could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  48-39-150(A)(10) (2008).Â  â€œAfter considering the views of interested agencies,\r\n  local governments and persons, and after evaluation of biological and economic\r\n  considerations, if the department finds that the application is not contrary\r\n    to the policies specified in this chapter, it shall issue to the applicant\r\n  a permit.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150(B) (2008) (emphasis added).Â  South\r\n  Carolina Code of Regulations section 30-11(B) includes the same general\r\n  considerations as South Carolina Code Annotated section 48-39-150, with section\r\n  30-11(B)(10) of the Regulations likewise providing the Department must consider\r\n  â€œ[t]he extent to which the proposed use could affect the value and enjoyment of\r\n  adjacent owners.â€ Â 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 30-11(B)(10) (Supp. 2007). Â The Regulations\r\n  further provide that in fulfilling its responsibility under section 48-39-150,\r\n  the Department must also be guided in part by â€œ[t]he extent\r\n  to which long-range, cumulative effects of the project may result within the\r\n  context of other possible development and the general character of the area.â€Â  23A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â Â§ 30-11(C)(1) (Supp. 2007).Â  The ALC judge determined\r\n  both the impact on adjacent owners and the long-range cumulative effects of the\r\n  project warranted denial of the permit.\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, there is evidence that the dock as proposed by the Olsons would have to\r\n  come through some trees and run down the drainage ditch easement border between\r\n  the Olson and Ball property lines, and that there was no cove or other such\r\n  area as depicted in the Olsonsâ€™ permit application.[6]Â \r\n  The dock would then have to â€œbendâ€ at a right angle to head out toward the\r\n  water.Â  Additionally, the Olsonsâ€™ proposed dock and pier would be in very close\r\n  proximity to existing docks and piers.Â  Specifically, the proposed Olson dock\r\n  would have to run between the Ball dock and Sims/McCown dock and would be as\r\n  close as seven feet from the Ball dock and forty-four feet from the Sims\r\n  floating dock.Â  Further, there is an existing piling[7] that is used for mooring and as an area for swimming between the Ball and Sims\r\n  floating docks, and that piling would have to be removed for construction of\r\n  the dock as proposed by the Olsons.Â  McCown testified to safety issues with\r\n  swimming off the docks that would be created by the proposed new dock.Â  Sims\r\n  also testified to safety concerns with boat navigation if another dock were\r\n  allowed in that area.Â  Sims maintained an attempt to place another dock between\r\n  the two existing docks would also lower his property value because of the close\r\n  proximity.Â  Ball likewise testified to the decreased value of her property from\r\n  the proposed Olson dock, stating it would â€œclog up the whole view,â€ make it\r\n  impossible to navigate, impair their ability to swim, kayak and fish from their\r\n  dock, and impede the ability to tie boats up to the side of her dock.Â \r\n  Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the ALC judgeâ€™s finding\r\n  concerning the effect on the adjacent ownersâ€™ value and enjoyment.Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is also evidence of record that the proposed Olson dock would have long-range,\r\n  cumulative effects within the context of other possible development and the\r\n  general character of the area.Â  McCown testified allowing the Olsons to build a\r\n  dock there would open it up to others being able to build a dock down any ditch\r\n  that runs to the Intracoastal Waterway.Â  Sims expressed concern that building a\r\n  dock in that location could block the easement and jeopardize maintenance of\r\n  the ditch.Â  Richard Chinnis testified placement of a dock down the drainage\r\n  easement could inhibit the maintenance of the area.Â  He further stated that a\r\n  permit for the proposed Olson dock would violate the definition of waterfront\r\n  property in the Regulations and, assuming adequate room existed to build the\r\n  dock as proposed, the cumulative impact of permitting docks on non-waterfront\r\n  property would cause material harm to the policies of the Act governing the\r\n  permitting process.Â  Thus, there is substantial evidence.\r\n  III.Â  Due Process\r\nThe Olsons next\r\n  assert they were not afforded procedural due process.Â  Specifically, they\r\n  maintain they were entitled to direct notice of the Sims/McCown dock permit\r\n  amendment and were not afforded the same.\r\n When Sims and\r\n  McCown applied to amend their permits to build a joint-use dock, no direct\r\n  notice was sent to the Olsons as adjoining property owners.Â  However, public\r\n  notice for the request was published in the Post and Courier on January 10,\r\n  2004.Â  The amended permit actually reduced the overall square footage of the\r\n  two pier heads, and changed the number of walkways from two to only one.Â \r\n  Richard Chinnis testified no public notice was required for an amended permit\r\n  if the size of the project was smaller and there was no change in use.Â \r\n  However, he later acknowledged, generally speaking, if it involves combining\r\n  two permits, â€œit should go on public notice.â€Â  It was never clarified whether\r\n  the newspaper notice sufficed as â€œpublic notice.â€\r\nAssuming\r\n  arguendo the Olsons were entitled to direct notice of the amended application,\r\n  we find no violation of the Olsonsâ€™ due process rights.Â  â€œProcedural due\r\n  process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals\r\n  of liberty or property interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause\r\n  of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.â€Â  Kurschner\r\n    v. City of Camden Planning Commâ€™n, 376 S.C. 165, 171, 656 S.E.2d 346, 350\r\n  (2008). Â â€œDue process requires (1) adequate notice; (2) adequate opportunity\r\n  for a hearing; (3) the right to introduce evidence; and (4) the right to\r\n  confront and cross-examine witnesses.â€Â  Clear Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 372 S.C. 230, 235, 642 S.E.2d 565, 567 (2007).Â  Procedural due process\r\n  requirements are not technical, and no particular form of procedure is\r\n  necessary.Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd. Of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452,\r\n  485, 636 S.E.2d 598, 615 (2006).Â  Rather, due process is flexible and calls for\r\n  such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.Â  Id. Â The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a\r\n  meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t. of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705&nbsp;(1997).Â  To prevail on a\r\n  claim of denial of due process, there must be a showing of substantial\r\n  prejudice.Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C.\r\n  430, 435, 319 S.E.2d 695, 698&nbsp;(1984).\r\nThe\r\n  amended permit for the Sims/McCown joint-use dock was issued in February 2004\r\n  and the Olsonâ€™s appealed the approval of the amendment the following month.Â  A\r\n  full hearing was held on the matter before the ALC, where the Olsons challenged\r\n  the joint-use dock permit approved for Sims and McCown.Â  As noted by the ALC\r\n  judge, the Olsons participated extensively in the hearing by eliciting\r\n  testimony, presenting evidence, and confronting witnesses.Â  Thus, the Olsons\r\n  received an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful\r\n  manner.Â  Furthermore, no prejudice resulted because the Olsons received\r\n  sufficient notice of the actions of OCRM such that they were able to obtain a\r\n  hearing before the ALC providing them the opportunities required by due\r\n  process.Â  We also agree with the ALC judge the fact that Sims and McCown\r\n  continued construction of the joint-use dock did not violate the Olsonsâ€™ due\r\n  process rights since, had the Olsons been successful in contesting the matter,\r\n  the ALC could have ordered the removal of the dock.Â  Accordingly, we find no\r\n  denial of the Olsonsâ€™ due process rights.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Equal Protection\r\nFinally, the Olsons maintain they were deprived of their right to\r\n  equal protection because Simsâ€™ lot 55 is â€œidentically situatedâ€ to their lot\r\n  56, and the denial of the right to a dock to them is therefore â€œpatently\r\n  unequal treatment.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\r\n  Constitution, â€œa state may not â€˜deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\r\n  equal protection of the laws.â€™â€Â  Town\r\n    of Iva ex rel. Zoning Admâ€™r v. Holley, 374 S.C. 537, 540-41, 649 S.E.2d\r\n  108, 110 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing U.S. Const. amend.Â  XIV, Â§ 1).Â  â€œThe sine qua non of an equal\r\n  protection claim is a showing that similarly situated persons received\r\n  disparate treatment.â€Â  Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 354,\r\n  461 S.E.2d 388, 391&nbsp;(1995).Â  The Olsons claim similarity between lots 55\r\n  and 56, summarily arguing they â€œhave angled lines in the highwater, both would\r\n  fail to reach water before either extended property line reached other land,\r\n  and both got an interest in the Graves permit.â€Â  The Olsons fail, however, to\r\n  cite any evidence of record that support these assertions.Â  Further, as\r\n  previously determined, the Olsonsâ€™ lot has no interest in the dock permit\r\n  originally issued to Graves and transferred to Sims.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  any rate, a review of the record reveals substantial differences in the two\r\n  properties.Â  First, the shape and location of the Olsonsâ€™ lot requires the\r\n  dockâ€™s walkway to be placed along a drainage ditch.Â  The Sims/McCown dock does\r\n  not run along the drainage ditch, but runs down their common property line.Â \r\n  Additionally, an aerial photograph showing the existing Ball and Sims/McCown\r\n  docks submitted into evidence, and used to demonstrate the position of the\r\n  proposed Olson dock, reflects that the Sims/McCown dock runs straight out over\r\n  the marsh and into the Intracoastal Waterway, while the Olson dock would have\r\n  to make a dogleg bend at a right angle to head out toward the water.Â  Chinnis\r\n  testified that OCRM â€œgenerally [does not] let people build sharply angled like\r\n  that off a non-waterfront property.â€Â  Accordingly, the Olsons failed to meet\r\n  their burden of demonstrating they were treated differently from other similarly\r\n  situated landowners and we find no equal protection violation.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the decision of the ALC is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While the Olsons asserted a portion of their property\r\n  bordered a â€œfinger of water,â€ there is evidence of record the area around there\r\n  is â€œhardly ever wetâ€ and there is no cove area to the property as asserted by\r\nthe Olsons.Â  \r\n[2] Sims and Ball also testified to their ownership of\r\n  lots 55A and 61A, respectively, which is marshland between their land lots 55\r\n  and 61 and the Intracoastal Waterway.Â  McCown also testified to his ownership\r\n  of the marsh between his lot 54 and the Waterway.Â  While the Olsons contest the\r\n  validity of their ownership of this marshland, we need not address the matter\r\nas it is unnecessary for our determination.Â  \r\n[3] Stephen Graves testified that there was a dock\r\n  contingency clause in the contract on his lot and Blume used a â€œdocking poleâ€\r\n  to the side of lot 61â€™s dock (the Ball dock) to get out of the contract,\r\nclaiming the pole interfered with his proposed dock.Â  \r\n[4] OCRM raises the issue of jurisdiction to this court.Â \r\n  Because the Olsonsâ€™ appeal was pending before the Appellate Panel, not the ALC\r\n  or the circuit court, on the effective date of Act 387 (codified at Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2007)), we find jurisdiction is proper in this court\r\n  pursuant to our supreme courtâ€™s recent decision in Chem-Nuclear Sys., LLC v.\r\n    S.C. Board of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 374 S.C. 201, 648 S.E.2d 601\r\n(2007). \r\n[5] Stephen\r\n  Graves testified he was involved with the sale of lot 56 to the Olsons and that\r\n  he never told the Olsons they had a joint-use dock with Sims.Â  He specifically\r\n  informed the Olsons that lot 56 did not have a dock permit and informed Mr.\r\n  Olson â€œa number of timesâ€ that he did not have a right to a dock for that\r\nproperty.Â  \r\n[6] Stephen\r\n  Graves testified the Olsonsâ€™ lot â€œdoes touch salt marsh on the cornerâ€ but it\r\n  then â€œbecomes the ditch that runs down the property line and all the way\r\nthrough the main drainage trunk.â€Â  \r\n[7] This piling appears to be the same â€œdocking poleâ€\r\n  Stephen Graves referred to that Blume used as a reason to get out of his\r\ncontract to purchase lot 55.

Â In particular, Power Products alleged that Kozma and\r\n  Ferguson were terminated in or around July 2003 and, â€œon information and\r\n  belief had already misappropriated all of the Trade Secrets of Power Products\r\n  with a plan toward opening a competitive business.â€Â  \r\nRespondents moved to dismiss based on a lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction, asserting each were citizens or corporate citizens of a\r\n  state other than South Carolina and there was an insufficient nexus from their\r\n  actions to support jurisdiction in this state.Â  Respondents submitted\r\n  affidavits in support of their motion to dismiss.Â  Fergusonâ€™s affidavit shows\r\n  she is a citizen and resident of Virginia and was employed with Power Products\r\n  from July 1992 through July 2003.Â  She worked solely in Virginia from 1992\r\n  until 1999, at which time she began to commute to South Carolina to work during\r\n  the week, but maintained her residency in Virginia, continued to perform some\r\n  of her work duties from her home in Virginia, and filed for unemployment in Virginia following her termination from Power Products in July 2003.Â  Kozma filed an\r\n  affidavit averring that he is a citizen and resident of Virginia and has been\r\n  since September 2003.Â  From November 1993 to March 1994 and from November 2001\r\n  to September 2003, Kozma performed services for Power Products in his capacity\r\n  as an employee of Longdrive, a New York corporation that served as a marketing\r\n  and sales consultant for Power Products.Â  Hobbsâ€™ affidavit indicates he is a\r\n  citizen and resident of Maryland and has never been a resident of South Carolina.Â  He was associated with Power Products as an independent contractor through\r\n  Lakeland, a Maryland corporation that performed certain engineering services\r\n  for Power Products.Â  Lakeland last performed services for Power Products in May\r\n  2003.Â  Finally, Montgomeryâ€™s affidavit indicates he is a citizen and resident\r\n  of Virginia, never having resided in South Carolina.Â  He was formerly employed\r\n  by Power Products in a sales capacity from 1986 to 1994, during which time he\r\n  was always based in Virginia.Â  South Carolina was never included in his sales\r\n  territory.Â  Power Products terminated his employment in 1994 after Montgomery suffered a back injury, and he has had no contact with Power Products since\r\n  that time.Â  \r\nPower Products\r\n  maintained jurisdiction was proper in South Carolina because (1) many of\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ tortious actions occurred while Respondents were in South Carolina\r\n  and (2) the respondents have minimum contacts with South Carolina because they\r\n  were current or former residents of this state, they committed numerous torts\r\n  in this state, and they are using the misappropriated trade secrets to sell or\r\n  attempt to sell their products in this state.Â  Power Products submitted the affidavits\r\n  of Al Burns and Jeffrey R. Rogers to support its contention Respondents were\r\n  misappropriating Power Productsâ€™ trade secrets and conducting business in South Carolina.Â  Power Products further included within its filings a printout of River\r\n  Technologiesâ€™ website, to show River Technologies was currently doing business\r\n  or attempting to do business in South Carolina.Â  Lastly, Power Products\r\n  submitted a decree of divorce showing Kozma had lived with his wife in South Carolina until their separation in July 2003.Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  The\r\n  court found â€œall Defendants are out-of-state residents and have so\r\n  resided at all times pertinent to this litigationâ€ and the â€œentities named as Defendants\r\n  are likewise corporate citizens of other states.â€Â  Further, the court found\r\n  Power Products is a corporation organized and registered in Virginia.Â \r\n  Additionally, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\n  [Power\r\n    Products] argues that if [Respondents] are competing in the nuclear industry,\r\n    they must be doing so using trade secrets taken from [Power Products].Â \r\n    However, this Court finds such conclusory statements an insufficient basis for\r\n    the assertion of in personam jurisdiction.Â  The record establishes that\r\n    fewer than seventy-two (72) nuclear power facilities exist in the United\r\n    States, and the existence of these facilities (and their purchasing\r\n    departments) are in no way â€œsecretâ€ or â€œconfidential.â€Â  The record further\r\n    reflects that there are presently four or five businesses which compete with\r\n    [Power Products] in the nuclear market.Â  The Court thus rejects [Power\r\n    Productsâ€™] argument that all nuclear industry sites are â€œits customersâ€ and any\r\n    contact with them constitutes evidence that these [Respondents] misappropriated\r\n    trade secrets.Â  Moreover, [Power Products] did not submit any evidence that the\r\n    â€œoff the shelfâ€ products re-sold by the [Respondents] were products developed\r\n    pursuant to anything â€œtakenâ€ from [Power Products].\r\n\r\nThe trial court held Power\r\n  Productsâ€™ â€œconclusory allegations fail to establish the contacts necessary to\r\n  invoke personal jurisdiction over these [Respondents] either generally or\r\n  specifically.â€Â  After analyzing the matter under South Carolinaâ€™s Long-Arm\r\n  Statute and under due process requirements, the court concluded Power Products\r\n  failed to establish the necessary requisites to confer jurisdiction pursuant to\r\n  both this stateâ€™s Long-Arm Statute and the minimum contacts required to afford\r\n  due process.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nPersonal\r\n  jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is a question to be resolved upon the\r\n  facts of each particular case.Â  Cockrell v.\r\n    Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 363 S.C. 485,\r\n  491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005).Â  â€œThe decision of the trial court\r\n  should be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence or influenced by error of\r\n  law.â€Â  Id.Â  The party seeking to invoke personal jurisdiction over a\r\n  non-resident defendant by using South Carolinaâ€™s long-arm statute bears the\r\n  burden of establishing jurisdiction.Â  S. Plastics Co. v. S. Commerce\r\n    Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 259, 423 S.E.2d\r\n    128, 130 (1992).Â â€œAt the pretrial stage, the burden of proving personal\r\n  jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a prima facie showing of jurisdiction\r\n  either in the complaint or in affidavits.â€Â  Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp;\r\n    Co., 358 S.C. 320, 328, 594 S.E.2d 878, 882 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When a\r\n  nonresident defendant attacks the allegations of a complaint based on\r\n  jurisdiction, the court is not confined to the allegations of the complaint but\r\n  may resort to affidavits or other evidence to determine jurisdiction.Â  Coggeshall\r\n    v. Reprod. Endocrine Assocs. of Charlotte, 376 S.C. 12, 16, 655 S.E.2d 476,\r\n  478 (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPower\r\n  Products maintains the trial court erred in finding it lacked personal\r\n  jurisdiction over the Respondents.Â  We disagree.\r\nTraditionally, our courts have employed a two-step\r\n  analysis in determining whether it is proper to exercise personal jurisdiction\r\n  over a nonresident defendant.Â  S. Plastics Co. v. S. Commerce Bank, 310\r\n  S.C. 256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992). Â First, the trial\r\n  court must determine that the South Carolina long-arm statute applies.Â  Second,\r\n  the trial court must determine that the nonresidentâ€™s contacts in South Carolina are sufficient to satisfy due process requirements.Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  both this court and our Supreme Court have noted our long-arm statute, which affords broad\r\n  power to exercise personal jurisdiction over causes of action arising from\r\n  tortious injuries in South Carolina, has been construed to extend to the outer\r\n  limits of the due process clause. Â Cockrell v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co.,\r\n  363 S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005); Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp;\r\n    Co., 358 S.C. 320, 329, 594 S.E.2d 878, 883 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  our courts have held, because we treat our long-arm statute as coextensive with\r\n  the due process clause, the sole question becomes whether the exercise of\r\n  personal jurisdiction in this case would violate the strictures of due process.\r\n  Â Id. Â See alsoÂ  Sonoco Prods. Co. v. Inteplast Corp.,\r\n  867 F.Supp. 352, 354 (D.S.C. 1994) (holding our long-arm statute has been\r\n  interpreted to reach the limits of due process and therefore the determination\r\n  of personal jurisdiction in South Carolina compresses into a due process\r\n  assessment of minimum contacts and fair play).Â  Whether employing the\r\n  traditional two-step analysis, or following the more recent determination that\r\n  the analysis is compressed into a due process assessment alone, it is clear\r\n  that personal jurisdiction over a\r\n  non-resident defendant may be invoked only if the\r\n  nonresidentâ€™s contacts in South Carolina are sufficient to satisfy due process\r\n  requirements.Â  Because we agree with the trial court that Power Products failed\r\n  to meet its burden of proving personal jurisdiction under the strictures of due\r\n  process, we affirm. Â \r\nDue process requires that there exist minimum contacts between the\r\n  defendant and the forum state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend\r\n  traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Â  Cockrell, 363\r\n  S.C. at 491, 611 S.E.2d at 508.Â  Further, the due process requirement mandates\r\n  the defendant possess sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state such\r\n  that he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.Â  Id. at 491-92, 611 S.E.2d at 508.\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether due process minimum contacts exist between the defendant\r\n  and the forum state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend\r\n  traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, a two pronged\r\n  analysis is applied.Â  S. Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 260, 423 S.E.2d at 131.Â  The court must (1) find\r\n  that the defendant has the requisite minimum contacts with the forum, without which,\r\n  the court does not have the â€œpowerâ€ to adjudicate the action and (2) find the\r\n  exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable or fair.Â  Id.Â  â€œIf either prong fails, the exercise\r\n  of personal jurisdiction over the defendant fails to comport with the\r\n  requirements of due process.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\n  Under the power prong, a minimum contacts analysis requires a\r\n    court to find that the defendant directed its activities to residents of South Carolina and that the cause of action arises out of or relates to those activities.Â  Without\r\n    minimum contacts, the court does not have the â€œpowerâ€ to adjudicate the action.Â \r\n    It is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant\r\n    purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the\r\n    forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.Â  The\r\n    â€œpurposeful availmentâ€ requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled\r\n    into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated\r\n    contacts.Â  Whether the constitutional requirement of minimum contacts has been\r\n    met depends on the facts of each case.\r\n\r\nMoosally, 358 S.C. at 331-332, 594 S.E.2d at 884-885 (internal\r\n  citations omitted).\r\nIn order to\r\n  determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign defendant meets\r\n  the fairness prong, the court must consider the following:Â  (1) the duration of\r\n  the activity of the nonresident within the state; (2) the character and\r\n  circumstances of the commission of the nonresidentâ€™s acts; (3) the\r\n  inconvenience resulting to the parties by conferring or refusing to confer\r\n  jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the Stateâ€™s interest in exercising\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Cockrell, 363 S.C. at 492, 611 S.E.2d at 508.Â  A single\r\n  act that causes harm in this State may create sufficient minimum contacts to\r\n  confer jurisdiction where the harm arises out of or relates to that act.Â  S.\r\n    Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 260-61, 423 S.E.2d at 131.Â  However, that single\r\n  act must create a â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ with the forum to give rise to\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Moosally, 358 S.C. at 331, 594 S.E.2d at 884.Â  \r\nA.Â  Power ProngÂ  \r\nPower\r\n  Products asserts it showed the requisite minimum contacts under the power\r\n  prong. It contends the majority of Respondentsâ€™ tortious acts occurred in South Carolina and the alleged duration and frequency of the acts were sufficient to\r\n  satisfy due process.Â  Power Products further maintains it presented evidence\r\n  Respondents were doing business in South Carolina. Â We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  to the assertion the tortious acts occurred in South Carolina, the trial court\r\n  found Power Products failed to allege specific facts to support its conclusory\r\n  allegation that Respondents took the trade secrets in South Carolina, and\r\n  further found the Respondentsâ€™ affidavits actually support the opposite\r\n  conclusion.Â  In particular, the court noted Fergusonâ€™s affidavit shows she was\r\n  unexpectedly terminated on a Sunday and was not allowed to return to Power\r\n  Productsâ€™ facility.Â  Because she did not anticipate being fired, she had no\r\n  opportunity to take anything from the company.Â  While Power Products contends\r\n  that Kozma and Ferguson had already misappropriated the trade secrets of Power\r\n  Products with a plan toward opening a competitive business prior to their termination,\r\n  we find absolutely no support for this conclusory assertion. Â Further, as did\r\n  the trial court, we find the case of Drayton Enters., L.L.C. v. Dunker,\r\n  142 F.Supp.2d 1177 (D.N.D. 2001) particularly instructive and applicable. \r\nIn Drayton,\r\n  the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota analyzed a\r\n  similar personal jurisdiction issue.Â  There, defendants were Value-Added\r\n  Products (VAP), an Oklahoma cooperative based in Oklahoma, and VAPâ€™s employee,\r\n  Dunker, who was a former employee of Drayton.Â  Id. at 1180.Â  Drayton, a North Dakota based company, initiated litigation alleging Dunker had disclosed trade\r\n  secrets to VAP and VAP had wrongfully obtained the trade secrets.Â  Id.Â  Drayton alleged that Dunker revealed its trade secrets to VAP and VAP hired him\r\n  with the secrets in mind.Â  The court found there seemed to be no argument that\r\n  if Dunker did reveal any secrets to VAP, he did so in Oklahoma after he was\r\n  hired by VAP.Â  Id. Â at 1184.Â  Thus, the only direct connection between\r\n  the litigation and the defendantsâ€™ actions was the injury caused by the alleged\r\n  tort to be felt in North Dakota.Â  Id.Â  The court held the tort was\r\n  allegedly committed in Oklahoma, not North Dakota, because until Dunker\r\n  revealed the information and VAP used it, no tort had been committed.Â  Id.Â  In the case at hand, Respondentsâ€™ affidavits establish that the concept\r\n  to form a business entity to do business in the nuclear field did not occur\r\n  until well after all of the Respondents had severed their working relationships\r\n  with Power Products and the individual defendants all resided in states other\r\n  than South Carolina.Â  While Kozma and/or Ferguson may have received such\r\n  information during their work for Power Products in South Carolina, they could\r\n  only have misappropriated it for use in the new company after their working\r\n  relationships with Power Products were terminated and their connections to South Carolina severed.Â  There is no specific allegation or showing that Ferguson and/or\r\n  Kozma revealed, and River Technologies used, the allegedly misappropriated\r\n  trade secrets prior to their termination of employment with Power Products. \r\nPower\r\n  Products relies on the printout of River Technologiesâ€™ website, to show River\r\n  Technologies was currently doing business or attempting to do business in South Carolina.Â  In particular, it points to language on the website which states, â€œOur\r\n  relationships extend to every commercial nuclear plant in the United States and Canada, a majority of US Government DOE and DOD sites, and several large industrial\r\n  manufacturers. . . .â€ Â However, as noted by the trial court, Power Products\r\n  failed to make any allegations or produce any evidence a South Carolina\r\n  resident purchased any product from or because of River Technologiesâ€™ website,\r\n  or that the website was particularly directed at South Carolinians.Â  See Brown v. Geha-Werke GmbH, 69 F.Supp.2d 770, 777-78 (D.S.C. 1999)\r\n  (holding the critical inquiry in such a matter is the nature and quality of\r\n  commercial activity conducted by an entity over the Internet in the forum\r\n  state, and where the record failed to reflect any commercial activity over the\r\n  Internet in South Carolina and plaintiff failed to submit evidence any South\r\n  Carolina resident, other than the staff of plaintiffâ€™s attorneyâ€™s law firm,\r\n  visited the entityâ€™s website or purchased any product over or because of the\r\n  website, or that the website was directed at South Carolina any more than any\r\n  other place, the entityâ€™s website did not provide the basis for an assertion of\r\n  personal jurisdiction).Â  \r\nPower\r\n  Products also relies on the affidavit of Al Burns, the former director of the\r\n  Planning Commission for Economic Development in Georgetown County.Â  In his affidavit, Mr. Burns states that Kozma informed him in August 2004 he had\r\n  opened a new company in Virginia that would be in the same business as Power\r\n  Products â€œand that he might be looking at moving the company down to Georgetown.â€ Â (emphasis added).Â  Mr. Burns further stated Kozma informed him he was\r\n  interested in playing in an annual golf tournament â€œas a prospective new\r\n  industrial client representing his new Virginia business.â€Â  At most, this\r\n  affidavit merely suggests Respondents considered doing business in South Carolina, not that they actually did business in South Carolina.Â  Accordingly, Power\r\n  Products failed to meet its burden of establishing Respondents directed activities to residents of South Carolina and that\r\n  the cause of action arises out of or relates to those activities, and therefore\r\n  failed to meet the requirements of the â€œpower prong.â€\r\nB.Â  Fairness\r\n  Prong\r\nPower Products contends the court may properly exercise\r\n  jurisdiction under the fairness prong.Â  It argues it has its principal place of\r\n  business in South Carolina and that much of the evidence and many of the\r\n  witnesses are located in South Carolina.Â  Power Products further maintains\r\n  Respondents are all either former residents of the state or have lived and/or\r\n  worked in this state for extended periods of time.\r\nAs noted by the trial court, River Technologiesâ€™ principal place\r\n  of business is in Virginia.Â  It does not have offices or employees in South Carolina, and there is no evidence it has any customers in this state.Â  None of the\r\n  Respondent entities are corporations of this state and none of the individual\r\n  Respondents are residents or citizens of South Carolina.Â  While Ferguson worked for Power Products in South Carolina for approximately four years out of\r\n  her eleven year employment with Power Products, she continued to maintain her\r\n  residency in Virginia the entire time.Â  Both Hobbsâ€™ and Montgomeryâ€™s affidavits\r\n  show they have never been residents of South Carolina.Â  Montgomery lives in Virginia and Hobbs lives in Maryland.Â  Only Kozma resided in South Carolina, and his\r\n  affidavit shows he became a citizen of Virginia in early September 2003.Â  We agree with the trial court that the Respondentsâ€™\r\n  limited working relationship with Power Products is not a sufficient nexus to\r\n  satisfy due process.Â  We also agree with the trial\r\n  court that the mere fact that the alleged injury may be felt in South Carolina is insufficient to support jurisdiction under the facts of this case.Â  As\r\n  noted, the alleged tortious conduct of the Respondents could not\r\n  have occurred until after Ferguson and Kozmaâ€™s relationships were severed with\r\n  Power Products and they revealed, and River Technologies used, the allegedly\r\n  misappropriated trade secrets. Â At this time, their connections to South Carolina had been severed.Â  Further, it is uncontested that\r\n  Power Products, despite the fact that it maintains its principal place of\r\n  business in South Carolina, is still a Virginia corporation, organized and\r\n  existing pursuant to Virginia law.Â  Accordingly, under the facts of this\r\n  case, we do not believe this stateâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction over the\r\n  Respondents would be reasonable or fair.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Power Products failed to establish sufficient minimum\r\n  contacts of any of the Respondentsâ€™ to indicate purposeful availment of the\r\n  privilege of conducting activities within this state such that they should be\r\n  haled into court in this state. Nor did Power Products meet its burden of\r\n  showing Respondentsâ€™ had such minimum contacts that exercise of jurisdiction is\r\n  reasonable or fair. Â Consequently, the evidence supports the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s findings that Power Products did not establish facts sufficient to\r\n  confer jurisdiction over Respondents.Â  For the foregoing reasons, we find the\r\n  trial court did not err by dismissing Power Productsâ€™ action for lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction.Â  Accordingly, the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Robert A.

Â A damages hearing was scheduled\r\n  for July 19, 2006, and Kim was served notice of the damages hearing.Â  Kim filed\r\n  a motion to set aside default and, with Meltonâ€™s consent, the damages hearing\r\n  was continued.Â  Kim moved to set aside default for good cause, inadvertence,\r\n  and excusable neglect on the grounds that: (a) she had only recently become\r\n  aware of the suit against her and no hearing on damages had been held; (b) she\r\n  had a meritorious defense; and (c) there would be no prejudice to Melton.Â  \r\nA\r\n  hearing on Kimâ€™s motion was held on November 13, 2006.Â  The court denied the\r\n  motion to set aside the entry of default and immediately proceeded to hear\r\n  Meltonâ€™s testimony in support of her motion for default judgment.Â  Melton and\r\n  Kim are Korean and they both have a limited proficiency in the English\r\n  language.Â  As such, Melton requested the use of an interpreter she brought with\r\n  her to the hearing.Â  Kim objected to the use of that particular interpreter and\r\n  requested the use of a joint court interpreter.[5]Â \r\n  The court performed a voir dire of the interpreter to determine her\r\n  experience.Â  After the voir dire, the court asked if there was any objection.Â \r\n  Kim objected to the interpreter and requested a South Carolina court certified\r\n  interpreter.Â  The court commenced the hearing without any interpreter.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn the\r\n  basis of Meltonâ€™s testimony, the court found Melton was entitled to a default\r\n  judgment in the amount of $50,000.Â  Kim filed a Rule 59(e) motion, arguing\r\n  default should be set aside, or in the alternative, the default judgment should\r\n  be vacated and she should be granted a new hearing on damages with a qualified\r\n  interpreter.Â  The court summarily denied the motion.Â  This appeal follows.[6] \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKim argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying relief from the default judgment.Â  We agree.\r\nThe power to set\r\n  aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court\r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Mitchell Supply Co., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 162-63,\r\n  375 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  An abuse of discretion arises when the\r\n  court issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or when the order,\r\n  based upon factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.Â  Goodson v.\r\n    Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., 295 S.C. 400, 402, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988).Â  Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, Kim asserts the court erred in denying the motion to set aside the\r\n  default judgment on the grounds that: (1) the evidence presented of Kimâ€™s\r\n  inadvertence and excusable neglect justified relief under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP;\r\n  (2) the court relied upon incompetent parol evidence and the court's subsequent\r\n  award of damages is without evidentiary support and was controlled by an error\r\n  of law; and (3) the court&#700;s refusal to accommodate her request for a\r\n  qualified court interpreter violated statutory law and deprived her of equal\r\n  access to justice and to the court proceedings.\r\nWe first address\r\n  the issue on appeal as to the request for an interpreter.Â  Pursuant to Section\r\n  15-27-155(A) of the South Carolina Code (2005): \r\n\r\n  [W]henever\r\n    a party or witness to a civil legal proceeding does not sufficiently speak the\r\n    English language to testify, the court may appoint a qualified interpreter to\r\n    interpret the proceedings and the testimony of the party or witness.Â  However,\r\n    the court may waive the use of a qualified interpreter if the court finds that\r\n    it is not necessary for the fulfillment of justice.Â  The court must first make a finding on the record that the waiver of a qualified interpreter\r\n    is in the best interest of the party or witness and that this action is in the\r\n    best interest of justice.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  In this\r\n  case, both parties have limited English proficiency and expressed concern with\r\n  a possible language barrier before the hearing.Â  When Kim objected to the use\r\n  of the interpreter Melton brought to the hearing, Melton agreed to an alternate\r\n  qualified court interpreter.Â  The court performed a voir dire of the\r\n  interpreter to determine her experience and abilities, after which Kim renewed\r\n  the objection to the use of that particular interpreter.Â  Kim requested a South Carolina qualified court interpreter but the court refused that request.Â  Rather than proceeding with the\r\n  interpreter Melton provided, the court held the damages hearing without the use of any interpreter.Â  Before proceeding\r\n  to the hearing, the court failed to make any findings under the statute that\r\n  waiver of the use of a qualified interpreter was in the best interest of the\r\n  party, or witness, or that it was in the best interest of justice.Â  We find the\r\n  courtâ€™s decision to proceed without the use of a qualified interpreter without\r\n  making any findings on the record that it was in the best interest of the\r\n  party, witness, or justice was legal error.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we find proceeding without the use of an interpreter prejudiced Kim. Â At the\r\n  hearing, Melton attempted to explain the transaction and exchange of money.Â  However,\r\n  the testimony is confusing and at times incoherent, such that both attorneys\r\n  and the judge often sought further clarification of Meltonâ€™s statements.Â  For\r\n  example: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q. \r\n    (Melton&rsquo;s Attorney)&nbsp; You gave her $50,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A. \r\n     (Melton):&nbsp; Yes \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    Okay. And what were you supposed to get for\r\n  that 50,000? What were you getting? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    She go &ndash; she go sign the $30,000 contract\r\n  promissory, and she gave me two check, two checks.&nbsp; One each check is $25, $25\r\na total of $50,000.&nbsp; She gave me check.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    Okay. Why did she give you two checks for\r\n  $25,000 if you paid her 50,000? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Because we help a partner asked &ndash; she wanted\r\n  $50,000.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;m thinking $50,000, she going to promise a contract.&nbsp; But she\r\n  go lawyer office.&nbsp; She say $30,000. Why?&nbsp; I ask you, why $30,000? I don&rsquo;t trust\r\n  her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I want your check. Give it to me.&nbsp; Any time you don&rsquo;t give me\r\n  help, partner, I want my money back. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n     Okay. So that was in case you didn&rsquo;t get your\r\n  half, if she didn&rsquo;t let you have your half?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    She don&rsquo;t give it to me. She no money back,\r\n  too. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    How did you give her the $50,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     She &ndash; I give her money.&nbsp; She give me check,\r\n  two checks. Mh-hmm (affirmative) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n     Okay.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:&nbsp;\r\n     I don&rsquo;t think she understood the\r\n  question.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q. \r\n    Okay.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Because I have the same question.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    . . . \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    Q.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    You paid her $50,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n    How did you give her the money? Was it in\r\n  cash?&nbsp; Or was it a check? How did you give it to her? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    Oh.&nbsp; I got something in the &ndash; the bank check\r\n  and cash it, too.&nbsp; But she want, everything wanted cash.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t\r\n  trust her, is I go to a lawyer office.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a notarizer and helping making\r\n  sure.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I want two checks, 25,000, 25,000, two checks.&nbsp; I needed\r\n  this.&nbsp; Then she gave it to me.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nAt\r\n  the close of Meltonâ€™s direct examination her attorney states, â€œ[y]our Honor, I\r\n  donâ€™t â€“ I â€“ it may be that we need to get a translator if â€“ I donâ€™t know if the\r\n  Court is following whatâ€™s going on.Â  I donâ€™t know that I can get any more\r\ndetail because of the language barrier.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  following testimony was elicited during cross-examination of Melton:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n     (Kim&rsquo;s Attorney)&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; What proof do you\r\n  have that you gave her $50,000? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A. \r\n    (Melton)&nbsp; They have a &ndash; it&rsquo;s a &ndash; I have a\r\n  contract&nbsp; promise to pay her for that. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp; \r\n    Where is that? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp; \r\n    Where is that? Okay. And two checks.&nbsp; And\r\n  there is &ndash; one of them is $30,000.&nbsp; One year.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a contract promise.&nbsp; And I\r\n  give her 50,000.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why, you know, she don&rsquo;t &ndash; she give &ndash; she &ndash; she a\r\n  liar.&nbsp; So I don&rsquo;t trust her.&nbsp; I need the two check, $50,000.&nbsp; Mm-hmm\r\n  (affirmative).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    You gave her a check for $50,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n     (Shakes head negatively). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    Did you give her cash? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    No. She give me two check. Mm-hmm\r\n  (affirmative). \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\nfollowing testimony was further elicited:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n     (Kim&rsquo;s Attorney)&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, ma&rsquo;am, it goes\r\n  back to my original question of, do you have any proof whatsoever that you\r\n  actually gave her $50,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    Because she wanted to have to share $50,000.\r\n  Mm-hmm (affirmative). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:&nbsp;\r\n    Ma&rsquo;am, let me &ndash; did you give her\r\n  $50,000? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:&nbsp;\r\n    Cash?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    She wanted cash.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a -- everything had\r\n  to prove money. Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Did you give her cash? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A. \r\n    Yes. She wanted cash. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    You gave her cash? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    Yes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    (Kim&rsquo;s Attorney)&nbsp; Ma&rsquo;am, do you have any sort\r\n  of withdrawal slip from your bank showing that you took out $50,000?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    But I don&rsquo;t give her $50,000.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t sign\r\n  anything.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t give me check. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    . . . \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n      Do you have any way to prove that you gave her\r\n  $50,000 in cash? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n     Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    What is that proof? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n     I have to talk?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n     You&rsquo;re telling us that&rsquo;s your proof?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Yes.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have to talk to\r\n  you.&nbsp; Mm-hmm (affirmative). \r\n  \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the contradictory statements and incoherent testimony of Melton and the lack of\r\n  an interpreter to assist with the language barrier, the court ultimately\r\n  ordered default judgment against Kim for $50,000.Â  We find Meltonâ€™s inability\r\n  to convey the facts of the transaction during the hearing, due to her limited\r\n  English proficiency and the lack of an interpreter, prejudiced Kim and affected\r\nher ability to contest the damages.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we find the court committed an error of law and thus abused its discretion in regard\r\n  to the interpreter issue.Â  We reverse and remand for a new damages hearing at\r\n  which time the court shall direct that a qualified interpreter must be present\r\n  or alternatively, the court must make the necessary findings of waiver under\r\n  the statute.[7]\r\nKim also argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to set aside the entry of default as provided\r\n  under Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  Since we have already determined a remand is\r\n  appropriate due to the interpreter issue, we also find a remand as to this\r\n  issue is appropriate.\r\nUnder Rule 55(c) of\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, a default may be set aside â€œfor\r\n  good cause shown.â€Â  Rule 55(c) should be â€œliberally construed to promote\r\n  justice and dispose of cases on the merits.â€Â  Bage v. Southeastern Roofing\r\n    Co. of Spartanburg, Inc., 373 S.C. 457, 471, 646 S.E.2d 153, 160 (Ct. App. 2007), cert. granted (Mar. 20, 2008). Â The decision whether to grant relief\r\n  from an entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court.Â  Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381\r\n  S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  On appeal, this court cannot substitute its\r\n  judgment for that of the trial judge and will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Ricks v. Weinrauch,\r\n  293 S.C. 372, 374, 360 S.E.2d 535, 536 (Ct. App. 1987).Â Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion arises when the judgeâ€™s decision was controlled by some error of law\r\n  or lacks evidentiary support.Â Â  Boland v. S.C. Public Service Authority,\r\n  281 S.C. 293, 295, 315 S.E.2d 143, 145 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nIn deciding whether\r\n  to set aside an entry of default, the court should consider the following\r\n  factors: (1) the timing of the motion for relief; (2) whether the defendant has\r\n  a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if\r\n  relief is granted.Â  Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501-02.Â  Kim\r\n  argues the court failed to weigh the Wham factors relevant to her\r\n  motion.Â  Specifically, Kim contends the only factor the court relied upon and\r\n  cited was the timing of the motion for relief.\r\n  â€œ[I]t is not\r\n  necessary for the trial judge to make specific findings in regard to the\r\n  factors enumerated in Wham.Â  This court has held â€˜[t]he trial judge will\r\n  not be reversed for failing to make specific findings of fact on the record for\r\n  each factor if there is sufficient evidentiary support in the record for the\r\n  finding of the lack of good cause.â€™â€ Bage, 373 S.C. at 472, 646 S.E.2d\r\n  at 161 (citing Dixon v. Besco Engineering, 320 S.C. 174, 179, 463 S.E.2d\r\n  636, 639 (Ct. App. 1995)).Â Â  \r\nArguably, in this\r\n  case, over seven months elapsed between the time Kim was served with the\r\n  summons and complaint and when she moved for relief.Â  As indicated, Kim\r\n  acknowledged the receipt of the envelope in November 2005, but never looked at\r\n  the papers served upon her and claimed the envelope was placed in her purse and\r\n  was subsequently stolen.Â  On the other hand, Kim filed her motion a little over\r\n  one month from being notified of the entry of default.Â  We recognize both of\r\n  these time periods are relevant to the consideration of the motion to set aside\r\n  the entry of default.Â  The trial judge cited in his order that â€œthe defendant\r\n  failed to file a motion for relief from the entry of default until some five\r\n  (5) months after said entry and more than thirty (30) days after she received\r\n  notification for the damages hearing.â€Â  This factual finding is clearly\r\n  erroneous based upon the record.Â  Default was entered on June 6, 2006, and\r\n  mailed to the parties on June 7, 2006.Â  The motion to set aside the entry of\r\n  default was filed on July 17, 2006.Â  We recognize this statement may have been\r\n  a clerical error on the part of the court.\r\nAlthough we review\r\n  this matter under an abuse of discretion standard, we find a remand is\r\n  appropriate to allow the court an opportunity to clarify or reconsider any\r\n  findings on the motion to set aside the entry of default in light of the\r\n  courtâ€™s erroneous factual finding or clerical error. We simply cannot determine\r\n  whether the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, relied solely on an\r\n  erroneous factual finding or whether that finding was merely a clerical error\r\n  on the issue of delay and the court relied on the other Wham factors.Â \r\n  Although we recognize the court is not required to make findings as to each\r\n  factor, we find it problematic to determine here whether the judge properly\r\n  exercised the discretion afforded under the law since the other Wham factors were not discussed. Â Â Since we already have determined a remand is\r\n  appropriate as to the default judgment damages hearing due to the interpreter\r\n  issue, we think fairness suggests that the judge also be afforded an\r\n  opportunity to clarify or revisit this matter on remand since the judge is\r\n  vested with the discretionary review in the first instance.Â  The judge, upon\r\n  making that determination, shall proceed in accordance with that determination\r\n  as well as in accordance with the opinion herein.\r\nDue to our\r\n  disposition of these issues, we need not address the remaining issues on\r\n  appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling\r\n  an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe respectfully\r\n  find the courtâ€™s decision to proceed without the use of a qualified interpreter\r\n  without making any findings on the record that it was in the best interest of\r\n  the party, witness, or justice was legal error and we therefore reverse and\r\n  remand as to this issue since we find prejudice to the appellant. Â We also\r\n  remand for further proceedings on the motion to set aside the entry of default\r\n  due to the courtâ€™s reliance on either an erroneous factual finding or a clerical\r\n  error so that the court may be afforded the initial opportunity to exercise its\r\n  discretion without consideration of this erroneous finding or clerical error.Â \r\n  Once a redetermination of the motion to set aside the entry of default is made,\r\n  the court shall proceed based on that determination and in accordance with our\r\n  opinion.Â  The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\nREVERSED\r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] There is some discrepancy as to what business Melton\r\nwas purchasing.Â  Melton describes the business as being located in Columbia, South Carolina, whereas Kimâ€™s Answer indicates the business was located in Augusta, Georgia.Â  \r\n[2] Meltonâ€™s complaint and motion for default with\r\n  attached affidavit allege a purchase price of $50,000.Â  Further, at trial\r\n  Melton testified she was owed $50,000, but did not explain the discrepancy\r\n  between the alleged $50,000 purchase price and the $30,000 purchase price\r\nindicated in the agreement.Â  \r\n[3] Again, there is some confusion as to what interest\r\n  Melton agreed to purchase.Â  The agreement indicates Melton was to receive a\r\n  one-half interest in the business, whereas Meltonâ€™s affidavit indicates she was\r\nto receive full ownership of the business. Â \r\n[4] Kim acknowledged receiving and signing for an\r\n  envelope in November 2005, as she was on her way out of town to visit her\r\n  ailing sister.Â  She recalled placing the envelope in her purse which she\r\n  alleged was subsequently stolen from her sonâ€™s car.Â  She further explained she failed\r\nto look at the contents of the envelope before it was stolen. Â Â \r\n[5] Melton\r\nagreed to the use of a joint court interpreter.Â Â  \r\n[6] Kim did not actually seek relief under Rule 60,\r\n  SCRCP, to set aside default judgment, as opposed to the entry of default under\r\n  SCRCP 55(c).Â  However, Kim raised the same grounds in a Rule 59 motion as would\r\n  be raised under Rule 60.Â  Notwithstanding, we need not resolve any issue raised\r\n  by this pleading distinction since Kim actually appeared at the damages hearing\r\n  and preserved her grounds for appeal as to the interpreter.Â  Moreover, Kim\r\n  filed an earlier Rule 55(c) motion which was denied by the court.Â  Since the\r\n  Rule 59(e) motion properly requested the court to address its lack of findings\r\n  pursuant to the interpreter statute, it was the proper procedural mechanism to\r\n  use.Â  The remainder of the Rule 59 motion pertaining to the default issue was\r\n  more properly characterized as a Rule 60(b) motion, SCRCP.Â  We are free to\r\n  treat the motion based upon its substance and effect as opposed to how it was\r\n  captioned.Â  See Mickle v. Blackmon, 255 S.C. 136, 140, 177 S.E.2d\r\n  548, 549 (1970).Â  While recharacterization could be problematic as to the\r\n  timeliness of an appeal since Rule 60 does not toll the filing of an appeal, we\r\n  do not see any jurisdictional bar where part of the relief requested is proper\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59.Â  In any event, the appellant asserts she did not receive\r\n  notice of the entry of judgment until January 8, 2007.Â  Since the appeal was\r\n  filed on February 6, 2007, we find the appeal is timely regardless of how the\r\nmotion is characterized.\r\n[7]Â  We recognize that counsel in civil cases will often\r\n  arrange for an interpreter to be present.Â  The trial court has the authority to\r\n  direct that a litigant, especially a non-indigent litigant as found herein,\r\n  provide for and compensate an interpreter.Â  Moreover, the court is not limited\r\n  to qualification only of an interpreter of choice by either one of the parties.Â \r\n  The court may exercise its discretion in the management of a trial or hearing\r\n  in such a manner as to proceed without multiple interpreters if fairness allows\r\n  it to do so and no prejudice will arise.Â  We leave these decisions to the trial\r\n  court.Â  Notwithstanding, absent a determination that an interpreter is not\r\n  necessary, the court must make findings on waiver as required by the statute.Â \r\n  The record herein indicates that an interpreter was necessary.Â  The court did\r\n  not base its decision on the failure of counsel to arrange for an interpreter\r\n  or upon a finding that an interpreter was not necessary.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court should have either qualified the interpreter present and proceeded\r\n  with that interpreter if qualified, or continued the proceeding with\r\n  instructions to the parties to make the necessary arrangements; alternatively,\r\n  the court should have made the findings provided by the statute as to waiver if\r\nthe court determined the requirements for waiver were met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4419","title":"Sanders v.

Lindemann and Christopher M. Coy, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.: This appeal arises from inmate Cleveland\r\n  Sandersâ€™ challenge of the manner by which payment of a two hundred and fifty\r\n  dollar DNA processing fee (â€œfeeâ€), required by statute, was deducted from his\r\n  E.H. Cooper Trust Fund account (â€œAccountâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1994, the South Carolina Legislature created the State\r\n  Deoxyribonucleic Acid Identification Record Database Act (â€œDNA Actâ€), Â§23-3-600\r\n  through Â§23-3-700 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, requiring certain inmates\r\n  to provide DNA samples.Â  The DNA Act lists the classes of offenders who are required\r\n  to give a sample and states when the sample is to be taken.Â  In addition, it\r\n  provides all inmates required to submit a sample must pay the fee.Â  This fee is\r\n  mandatory and may not be waived by a court. \r\nIn August 2004, Sanders, an inmate at the Tuberville Correctional\r\n  Institution (â€œTubervilleâ€), signed a â€œDNA Notice &amp; Payment Proceduresâ€ form\r\n  (â€œPayment Formâ€) indicating three options for payment of the fee: Sanders could\r\n  choose to pay the fee from his Account by completing a Form 15-1, â€œCooper Trust\r\n  Fund Withdrawal;â€ he could have a non-incarcerated family member pay the fee by\r\n  money order; or, he could have the money deducted from his inmate wages at a\r\n  rate of 5% when receiving more than $5.00 for the bi-weekly pay period.Â  Sanders\r\n  did not sign the Form 15-1 authorizing a deduction from his Account, but did\r\n  sign the form authorizing a 5% deduction from his wages each pay period.Â  \r\nAt some point after Sanders signed the Payment Form, an\r\n  administrative decision was made to change the fee collection procedure in\r\n  order to facilitate the recovery of the fees and to provide a more equitable\r\n  system where wage-earning inmates were not the only inmates required to pay the\r\n  fee.Â Â  Under the new policy, inmates receiving non-wage deposits into their Account\r\n  would automatically have 10% of those deposits retained to pay the fee.Â  On\r\n  August 18, Acting Director of Operations for the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Corrections (â€œthe Departmentâ€), Robert Ward, disseminated a memorandum to all\r\n  wardens regarding the new procedure.Â  The memorandum stated the new procedure\r\n  would begin September 13, 2004, and requested all wardens notify the inmate\r\n  population of the change in policy.Â  \r\nIn late 2004, Sanders noticed several deductions listed on his Account\r\n  statement for payment of the fee.[2]Â \r\n  The deductions were made from monies directly deposited into his Account from\r\n  family members and friends and were in addition to the 5% deductions taken from\r\n  his wages.Â  Sanders filed a Step 1 Inmate Grievance claiming the DNA Act did\r\n  not allow the Department to withdraw non-wage related funds to cover the fee.Â  Â He\r\n  further argued the DNA Act, as applied to him, was an ex post facto violation\r\n  which enhanced his sentence by assessing additional fees after his punishment\r\n  was adjudicated.Â  Sanders requested â€œthe $24.50 (plus another $30 taken from a\r\n  recent $300 deposit) be credited back to my account and future deposits to me\r\n  from outside sources not be tampered with, unless, of course, the law is\r\n  changed to reflect this practice no longer illegal.â€Â  \r\nThe request was denied and Sanders filed an appeal to the\r\n  Administrative Law Judge (â€œALJâ€). Â The ALJ found Sanders had a property\r\n  interest in non-wage funds deposited into his Account, but he was provided\r\n  notice of the change in procedure in a manner that satisfied the requirements\r\n  of minimal due process. Â Additionally, the ALJ refused to hear Sandersâ€™ ex post\r\n  facto claim finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.Â  Sanders\r\n  appealed the decision to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court found sufficient\r\n  evidence to support the ALJ and affirmed the decision. Â This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n In an appeal of\r\n  the final decision of an administrative agency, the standard of appellate\r\n  review is whether the ALJâ€™s findings are supported by substantial evidence.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C) (Supp. 2007). Â Although this court shall not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ as to findings of fact, we may\r\n  reverse or modify decisions which are controlled by error of law or are clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Id. Â In determining whether the ALJâ€™s decision was supported by substantial\r\n  evidence, this court need only find, considering the record as a whole, evidence\r\n  from which reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion that the ALJ\r\n  reached.Â  Durant v. S.C. Dept. of Health and Environmental Control, 361\r\n  S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The mere possibility of\r\n  drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a\r\n  finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Id. at 420, 604\r\n  S.E.2d at 707.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note the Department claims the circuit court erred in affirming the ALJâ€™s\r\n  initial finding Sanders had a property interest in his non-wage funds deposited\r\n  in his Account.Â  We do not address this issue because the Department failed to\r\n  cross appeal the ALJâ€™s finding.Â  Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle,\r\n  334 S.C. 176, 187, 512 S.E.2d 123, 129 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding a lower courtâ€™s\r\n  finding was the law of the case because respondent failed to cross appeal the\r\n  issue); Rule 203(c), SCACR (detailing the proper procedure for filing a cross\r\n  appeal).Â  Therefore, the ALJâ€™s finding that Sanders maintained a property\r\n  interest in non-wage funds deposited into his Account is the law of the case\r\n  and we find the circuit court did not err in affirming the ALJ on this issue. Â See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175,\r\n  525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (finding an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is\r\n  the law of the case).[3]Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we next determine whether the notice provided Sanders met the minimal\r\n  requirements of due process. Â Sanders alleges the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding the ALJ properly construed the DNA Act so as to allow the Department to\r\n  recover non-wages in payment of the fee.Â  The DNA Act provides: \r\n\r\n  Processing fee; payment by person\r\n    providing sample. \r\n    (A) A person who is required to provide a sample pursuant to this\r\n    article must pay a two hundred and fifty dollar processing fee which may not be\r\n    waived by the court.Â  If the person is incarcerated, the fee must be paid\r\n    before the person is paroled or released from confinement and may be garnished\r\n    from wages the person earns while incarcerated.Â  If the person is not sentenced\r\n    to a term of confinement, payment of the fee must be a condition of the\r\n    personâ€™s sentence and may be paid in installments if so ordered by the court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  23-3-670 (Supp. 2007).Â  Sanders claims\r\n  the statute provides the fee may only be paid from wages earned by inmates.Â  While\r\n  the statute provides the fee may be â€œgarnished from wages,â€ we find it does not\r\n  restrict the Department from recovering the fee from non-wages voluntarily deposited in the inmateâ€™s Account subsequent to notice of the deduction\r\n  procedure.\r\nWe also find the circuit\r\n  court properly affirmed the ALJâ€™s finding that the notice provided of the\r\n  change in the fee collection procedure met the minimal requirements of due\r\n  process.Â  When the DNA Act was first enacted, the Department adopted a\r\n  procedure whereby all funds in an inmateâ€™s Account in excess of the recognized indigency\r\n  level were automatically deducted until the fee was fully paid.Â  Sprouse v. Sanford, No. 0:04-22477-RBH (D.S.C. Jan. 22, 2008).Â  The Department subsequently\r\n  changed its procedure to automatically deduct the fee from inmate wages only.Â  Id.Â  This meant that any non-wage\r\n  deposits were not subject to an automatic deduction.Â  Id.Â  This procedure was in place at the time Sanders signed\r\n  the Payment Form in August 2004.Â  Under this procedure, inmates who received\r\n  funds from outside sources avoided payment of the fee while inmates participating\r\n  in work programs faced deductions from their accounts for the fee.Â  \r\nConsequently, the\r\n  Department changed its procedure so as to automatically deduct 10% of all\r\n  non-wage deposits into an Account until the fee was paid in full.Â  Id. Â The manner by which deductions were made from inmate wages remained the same.Â  The\r\n  new procedure was outlined in an August memorandum sent to all wardens within\r\n  the state.Â  The memorandum\r\n  also indicated inmates were to be notified of the change in the procedure prior\r\n  to September 13, 2004.Â  Michael Sheedy,\r\n  the warden at Tuberville in August 2004, stated in his affidavit that the memorandum\r\n  was posted in each housing unit on August 19, 2004.Â  Further, Sheedy stated he notified\r\n  the Inmate Relations Council about the information so that it could assist in\r\n  disseminating the memorandum. Â \r\nThe ALJ found\r\n  sufficient factual evidence that the memorandum was sent to Sheedy on August\r\n  18, 2004, and that Sheedy provided notice to all inmates.Â  The ALJ concluded\r\n  that such notice met the demands of minimal due process and therefore any funds\r\n  deducted from the Account which were deposited after notice were properly\r\n  deducted.Â  The circuit court found sufficient evidence to support the ALJâ€™s\r\n  finding. Â The circuit courtâ€™s review of the ALJ order must be confined to the\r\n  record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  The circuit court may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or\r\n  modify an ALJâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â  Further, neither the circuit court nor this court may substitute its judgment\r\n  for that of the ALJ on questions of fact when the facts are supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.Â  Id.; see also Al-Shabazz v.\r\n    State, 338 S.C. 354, 380, 527 S.E.2d 742, 756 (2000).\r\nWe find Sanders had\r\n  notice. Â Prior to the change in procedure, he knew he was required to submit a\r\n  DNA sample, pay a two hundred and fifty dollar fee, and knew that the fee was automatically\r\n  going to be deducted from his wages as he signed a form notifying him of\r\n  this procedure as to wages.Â  Further, we find substantial evidence in the\r\n  record to support the ALJâ€™s finding that the memorandum was sent to and\r\n  received by Sheedy and that he provided notice to all inmates regarding the\r\n  change in the fee collection procedure as to non-wages.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find there was sufficient evidence that the posting of the fee collection\r\n  procedure provided notice and did not violate Sandersâ€™ due process rights; accordingly,\r\n  the circuit court did not err in affirming the ALJâ€™s decision.[4]Â \r\n  Additionally, we note that once Sanders was provided notice of the change in\r\n  procedure, the deposit of any money, beyond wages, into the Account by Sanders\r\n  or his family and friends was completely voluntary.[5] Â Â \r\nLastly, Sanders\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in affirming the ALJâ€™s conclusion it lacked\r\n  jurisdiction to hear his ex post facto claim.Â  We agree. \r\nAn ALJ has\r\n  jurisdiction to hear appeals from the final decision of the Department in\r\n  non-collateral or administrative matters.Â  Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 369,\r\n  527 S.E.2d at 750.Â  â€œAn ex post facto violation occurs when a change in the law\r\n  retroactively alters the definition of a crime or increases the punishment for\r\n  a crime.â€Â  Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 261, 531 S.E.2d 507, 509\r\n  (2000).Â  Ex post facto violation claims are non-collateral matters.Â  Id. at 260, 531 S.E.2d at 509.Â  Therefore, we find the ALJ did have jurisdiction to\r\n  hear Sandersâ€™ ex post facto claim.Â  However, for purposes of judicial economy,\r\n  we address Sandersâ€™ ex post facto claim. \r\nA\r\n  law violates the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and South Carolina\r\n  Constitutions if it 1) applies to events that occurred before its enactment,\r\n  and 2) the offender of the law is disadvantaged by the law.Â  State v. Walls,\r\n  348 S.C. 26, 30, 558 S.E.2d 524, 525 (2002); see also Cooper v. S.C.\r\n    Dept. of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Servs., Op. No. 26480 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 5, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 34) (citing State v. Walls for\r\n  the proposition that the above stated elements must be present for a law to\r\n  fall within the prohibition).Â  Further, â€œfor the [E]x [P]ost [F]acto [C]lause\r\n  to be applicable, the statute or the provision in question must be criminal or\r\n  penal in nature.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nA\r\n  determination of whether a statute is civil or criminal in nature is primarily\r\n  a question of statutory construction, which begins by reference to the actâ€™s\r\n  text and legislative history.Â  In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 648, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 311, 316 (2001).Â  â€œWhere the legislature has manifested its intent that\r\n  the legislation is civil in nature, the party challenging that classification\r\n  must provide â€˜the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in\r\n  either purpose or effect as to negate the [legislatureâ€™s] intention.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001)).\r\nIn Cannon\r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole and Pardon Servs., 361 S.C. 425, 604 S.E.2d\r\n  709 (Ct. App. 2004), revâ€™d on other grounds, 371 S.C. 581, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  429 (2007), this court found the DNA Act to be civil in nature.Â  â€œBecause the South Carolina legislatureâ€™s intent appears to have been to protect the public, and not to\r\n  punish those individuals who commit or have committed the specified crimes, South Carolinaâ€™s DNA Act is non-punitive and does not constitute a criminal penalty.â€Â  Id. at 433, 604 S.E.2d at 714. Â Further, this court found the plaintiff had failed\r\n  to prove the DNA Act was so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate\r\n  the legislatureâ€™s intention.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the supreme court has since reversed Cannon, it did so based upon the\r\n  statutory construction regarding the meaning of the word â€œparoledâ€ as it applied\r\n  to Cannon.Â  The court did not address the finding by this court that the DNA Act\r\n  was civil, not penal, or the finding that the Act did not violate the Ex Post\r\n  Facto Clause.Â  While not controlling due to its ultimate disposition on appeal,\r\n  we find the statutory construction of the DNA Act and the reasoning provided by\r\nthis court in Cannon nonetheless persuasive[6].Â  \r\nÂ We\r\n  simply are not convinced that the DNA Act makes an act which was innocent\r\n  before the law, criminal thereafter and now punishes said act. Â Moreover, the DNA\r\n  Act does not impose a subsequent greater punishment than that which existed at\r\n  the time the act was committed, nor does it make a crime more aggravated than\r\n  it was when committed before the change in law.Â  Finally, the DNA Act does not alter\r\n  in any way the nature of the proof or evidence necessary for a crime at the\r\n  time of the commission of the offense.Â  See Stogner v. California,\r\n  539 U.S. 607 (2003); Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24 (1981); Calder v.\r\n    Bull, 3 U.S. 386 (1798); see also Jones v. Murray, 962 F.2d 302, 309 (4th Cir. 1992).\r\nThus,\r\n  we find the Ex Post Facto Clause is not applicable in this case because the DNA\r\n  Act is civil, not criminal or penal, in nature.Â  Further, having found that any\r\n  deposits made into Sandersâ€™ Account after September 13, 2004, were voluntarily made with notice of the fee collection procedure, we can find no way in which\r\n  the DNA Act is so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the\r\n  legislatureâ€™s intent.Â  Had Sanders told family members and friends not to\r\n  deposit monies into his Account, he could have avoided any deduction about\r\n  which he had been provided advance notice.Â  Quite simply, we decline to find a\r\n  punitive effect because Sanders had notice of the consequences and the\r\n  contributions were voluntarily made.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the DNA Act does not restrict the Department from recovering the fee from\r\n  non-wages voluntarily deposited into the inmateâ€™s Account. Â Furthermore, we find there was sufficient evidence that the\r\n  posting of the fee collection procedure provided notice and did not violate\r\n  Sandersâ€™ due process rights; therefore, we conclude the circuit court did not\r\n  err in affirming the ALJâ€™s decision.Â  Lastly, we find the ALJ did have\r\n  jurisdiction to hear Sandersâ€™ ex post facto claim; however, we hold the Ex Post\r\n  Facto Clause is not applicable in this case because the DNA Act is civil, not\r\n  criminal or penal, in nature.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Sanders\r\n  received monthly statements indicating all Account activity.Â  The statement\r\n  included wages earned working in the prison library, monies directly deposited\r\n  from family members and friends, and monies withdrawn by Sanders for canteen\r\npurchases. \r\n[3] Our holding the ALJâ€™s unappealed finding that Sanders\r\n  maintained a property interest is the law of the case should in no way be\r\n  interpreted as this courtâ€™s resolution of this issue.Â  We need not do so under\r\nthe posture of this case.\r\n[4] On appeal, Sanders also finds error in the ALJâ€™s\r\n  acceptance of two arguments made by the Department.Â  The Department claimed\r\n  Sandersâ€™ non-wage monies were subject to garnishment because 1) he gave consent\r\n  by signing a Form 1815 and 2) wage and non-wage monies were comingled and there\r\n  was no way to differentiate wages from non-wages.Â  Since the ALJ did not rely on\r\neither argument in his order, we find no error. \r\n[5] Â Likewise, we note that the new procedure for\r\n  deducting the fee was not applied to any funds previously deposited into\r\n  Sandersâ€™ Account.Â  The new procedure was applied only to those monies deposited\r\ninto his Account after September 13, 2004. \r\n[6]Â  In a recent decision upholding the processing fee\r\n  requirement of the DNA Act, the federal district court in South Carolina\r\n  specifically held that the requirement of payment of a processing fee is civil,\r\n  not criminal or penal.Â  In re DNA Ex Post Facto Issues, No.\r\n  2:99-CV-5555-RBH (D.S.C. Oct. 19, 2007).Â  In arriving at its determination, the\r\n  district court relied on the legislative intent of the statute stating â€œit is\r\n  clear that the intent of the state legislature was not to punish inmates by\r\n  imposition of the fee but rather to provide funds for the implementation and\r\noperation of the database.â€Â  Id. at 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4420","title":"Leon v.

Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â  To show counsel was deficient, the applicant must\r\n  establish counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under\r\n  prevailing professional norms.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687;Â Â  Cherry, 300 S.C. at 117-18, 386 S.E.2d at 625.Â  When a guilty plea has been\r\n  entered, the applicant must prove counselâ€™s representation was below the\r\n  standard of reasonableness and but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, there\r\n  is a reasonable probability the applicant would not have pled guilty and would\r\n  have insisted on going to trial.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58-59 (1985); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 543, 402 S.E.2d 484, 485\r\n  (1991).Â  In determining guilty plea issues, it is proper to consider the guilty\r\n  plea transcript, as well as evidence at the PCR hearing.Â  Harres v. Leeke,\r\n  282 S.C. 131, 133, 318 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1984).Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if we assume counselâ€™s performance was deficient, Leon has the burden to\r\n  establish prejudice under the two-prong Strickland test.Â  â€œ[I]n order to\r\n  satisfy the â€˜prejudiceâ€™ requirement [in the context of a guilty plea], the\r\n  defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\r\n  counselâ€™s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on\r\n  going to trial.â€Â  Alexander, 303 S.C. at 542, 402 S.E.2d at 485.Â  Here, Leon testified he did not understand the interpreter provided by the court because he was\r\n  nervous and the interpreter spoke too fast.Â  However, when asked during\r\n  direct-examination if he would have gone to trial instead of pleading guilty if\r\n  someone would have further explained his rights or possible defenses, Leonâ€™s\r\n  response was, â€œNo.â€Â  Thus, Leon fails to prove the deficient performance by his\r\n  attorney prejudiced his case.Â  Because Leon did not establish prejudice, the\r\n  PCR court erred in granting PCR.Â  Therefore, the order of the PCR court is\r\nREVERSED.[1] \r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4421","title":"McLaughlin v.

(Dunes Realty) was Williamsâ€™ listing\r\n  agent.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 3, 2003, Kingsmore contacted Dunes Realty and requested a Residential\r\n  Property Disclosure Statement (the Disclosure Statement) for the Subject\r\n  Property.Â  On May 5, 2003, Williams and her husband prepared the Disclosure\r\n  Statement, which was subsequently sent to Kingsmore.Â  Upon receipt of the\r\n  Disclosure Statement, Kingsmore noticed several of the items were left blank\r\n  and there were no explanations for certain items, indicating possible problems\r\n  with the Subject Property.Â  Kingsmore requested a more complete disclosure\r\n  statement; however, neither Dunes nor Williams provided one.Â  \r\nOn May 14, 2003,\r\n  Kingsmore showed the Subject Property to McLaughlin.Â  Ultimately, McLaughlin\r\n  decided to submit an offer to purchase the Subject Property and executed\r\n  contracts with Chicora to establish the representative relationship between the\r\n  parties.Â  On May 15, 2003, Kingsmore showed the Disclosure Statement to\r\n  McLaughlin and advised him to obtain an inspection to ensure there were no\r\n  major defects with the Subject Property.Â  McLaughlin initialed each page of the\r\n  Disclosure Statement, signifying he had reviewed it.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  negotiations between McLaughlin and Williams, the parties entered into an\r\n  Agreement of Sale and Purchase and scheduled the closing for June 18, 2003.Â \r\n  Pursuant to the agreement, McLaughlin employed U.S. Home Inspections to perform\r\n  a â€œwhole house inspectionâ€ on the Subject Property.Â  Following the inspection,\r\n  McLaughlin received a written inspection report (the Home Inspection Report)\r\n  indicating moisture damage to the exterior of the Subject Property. \r\nIn addition to the\r\n  Home Inspection Report, a termite and moisture inspection (the CL-100) was\r\n  performed on the Subject Property and included in the closing documents.Â  The\r\n  CL-100 indicated the presence of wood-destroying fungi and a wood moisture\r\n  content of 28% or more below the first main floor.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 18, 2003, McLaughlin closed and took possession of the Subject Property.Â \r\n  Approximately six weeks following the closing, McLaughlin learned of defects in\r\n  the structure of the Subject Property due to prior water intrusion.Â  \r\nMcLaughlin asserted\r\n  claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation against Williams, Chicora, and\r\n  Dunes Realty.Â  Separately, each defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.Â \r\n  In separate orders, the circuit court granted summary judgment for all three\r\n  defendants.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion, this Court applies the same standard of review as the circuit court\r\n  under Rule 56, SCRCP. Â Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d\r\n  437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005). Â Summary judgment\r\n  is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Â Id.Â  To determine\r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing court must consider the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcLaughlin\r\n  argues the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Williams and Chicora because there was a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to his ability to rely upon the Disclosure Statement.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  survive a motion for summary judgment, McLaughlin must offer some evidence that\r\n  a genuine issue of material fact existed as to each element of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. SeeÂ  Steele v. Rogers,\r\n  306 S.C. 546, 552, 413 S.E.2d 329, 333 (Ct. App. 1992) (explaining the plaintiff\r\n  has the burden to prove each element of the cause of\r\n  action).Â  To maintain a claim for fraud, a plaintiff must show by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence:\r\n\r\n  (1) a\r\n    representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) knowledge of its\r\n    falsity or a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the\r\n    plaintiff act upon the representation; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its\r\n    falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely\r\n    thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s\r\n    consequent and proximate injury.\r\n\r\nHendricks v. Hicks,&nbsp;374 S.C. 616, 620, 649 S.E.2d 151,\r\n  152-53&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007).Â  To maintain\r\n  a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must show by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence: \r\n\r\n  (1) the\r\n    defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a\r\n    pecuniary interest in making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of\r\n    care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the\r\n    defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff\r\n    justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a\r\n    pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance upon the representation.\r\n\r\nRedwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v.\r\n  Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 473-74, 581\r\n  S.E.2d 496, 504&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  key difference between fraud\r\n  and negligent misrepresentation is that fraud requires the conveyance of a\r\n  known falsity, while negligent misrepresentation is predicated upon\r\n  transmission of a negligently made false statement.â€ Armstrong v. Collins,\r\n  366 S.C. 204, 219-20, 621 S.E.2d 368, 375-76&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).Â  While the two causes of action differ, both\r\n  fraud and negligent misrepresentation contain â€œthe necessary element that the\r\n  hearer had the right to rely upon\r\n  the misrepresentation or fraud.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note McLaughlinâ€™s claims against each of the three defendants are based on his\r\n  assertion that the Disclosure Statement completed by Williams was a\r\n  misrepresentation.Â  Specifically, McLaughlinâ€™s complaint asserted: 1) the\r\n  Disclosure Statement was a misrepresentation, upon which he reasonably and\r\n  detrimentally relied; and 2) all three Defendants had a statutory duty to\r\n  ensure that the Disclosure Statement was in compliance with the applicable\r\n  statutory law.Â  Because McLaughlinâ€™s claims focused on the Disclosure Statement\r\n  as a misrepresentation, we must determine whether McLaughlin was entitled to\r\n  rely on the Disclosure Statement itself.Â  \r\nIn arguing summary judgment was inappropriate because\r\n  there was an issue of fact as to whether he could rely upon the Disclosure\r\n  Statement, McLaughlin points to the general premise that â€œissues of reliance and its reasonableness going as\r\n  they do to subjective states of mind and applications of objective standards of\r\n  reasonableness, are preeminently factual issues for the trier of facts.â€Â  Unlimited\r\n    Servs., Inc. v. Macklen Enters., Inc., 303 S.C. 384, 387, 401 S.E.2d 153,\r\n  155&nbsp;(1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  Additionally,\r\n  McLaughlin notes â€œa buyer has the right\r\n  in South Carolina to rely on a seller of a home to disclose latent defects or\r\n  hidden conditions which are not discoverable on a reasonable examination of the\r\n  property and of which the seller has knowledge.â€Â  May v. Hopkinson, 289\r\n  S.C. 549, 557, 347 S.E.2d 508, 513&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  Â Â \r\nHowever,\r\n  while issues of reliance are ordinarily resolved by the finder of fact, â€œthere can be no reasonable reliance on a misstatement if the\r\n  plaintiff knows the truth of the matter.â€Â  Gruber v. Santee Frozen Foods,\r\n    Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 20, 419 S.E.2d 795, 800&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992).Â  Thus, if\r\n  the undisputed evidence clearly shows the party asserting reliance has\r\n  knowledge of the truth of the matter, there is no genuine issue of material\r\n  fact. \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the circuit court determined McLaughlin failed to create an\r\n  issue of fact regarding reliance on the Disclosure Statement in light of the\r\n  information available to him prior to closing.Â  The circuit court pointed to\r\n  the information contained in the Home Inspection Report and the CL-100, which\r\n  showed the existence of water damage to the Subject Property, as well as the\r\n  testimony of McLaughlin and Kingsmore stating such information placed them on\r\n  notice of potential moisture problems.Â  Ultimately, the circuit court\r\n  determined because of this information, no reasonable jury could conclude\r\n  McLaughlin had a right to rely on the Disclosure Statement.Â  \r\nMcLaughlin\r\n  argues there is an issue of fact as to what level of knowledge could be gleaned\r\n  from the information contained in the two reports.Â  Specifically, he argues the\r\n  Home Inspection Report does not indicate water damage to locations within the\r\n  interior portion of the house, and therefore, there is an issue of fact as to\r\n  whether or not the Home Inspection Report precluded him from relying upon the\r\n  Disclosure Statement.Â  McLaughlin also argues the CL-100 only indicates the\r\n  presence of active wood destroying fungi, which is not an issue in this case.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the Disclosure Statement indicated Williams was not aware of a malfunction or\r\n  defect due to â€œwater seepage, leakage, dampness or standing water or water\r\n  intrusion from any source in any area of the structure,â€ the Home\r\n  Inspection Report clearly informed McLaughlin there was â€œ[s]ome moisture\r\n  damageâ€ in various locations on the exterior of Subject Property.[2] (emphasis added).Â  The CL-100 reported â€œactive wood destroying fungiâ€ and a moisture\r\n  content of at least 28% below the first main floor of the house.Â  Furthermore, the CL-100 explicitly noted â€œfungi damage to woodâ€ is â€œcommonly called\r\n  water damage.â€Â  Both the Home Inspection Report and the CL-100 clearly show McLaughlin\r\n  had information that directly contradicted the Disclosure Statement.Â  \r\nIn addition to the\r\n  information contained in the Home Inspection Report and CL-100, McLaughlinâ€™s\r\n  testimony also supports the conclusion that he could not, as a matter of law,\r\n  rely upon the Disclosure Statement.Â  McLaughlin testified the documents reflect\r\n  moisture damage at the home and should have â€œraised red flags.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  sum, the Home Inspection Report and CL-100 clearly illustrate McLaughlin had\r\n  information indicating there was moisture damage to the Subject Property.Â \r\n  McLaughlin had knowledge that directly contradicted the representations found\r\n  in the Disclosure Statement, and therefore, as a matter of law, he failed to\r\n  establish the necessary element of reliance for his claims of fraud and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in its grant of\r\n  summary judgment.\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the circuit court on the basis that McLaughlin could not rely on the\r\n  Disclosure Statement because the Home Inspection Report and CL-100 gave him knowledge\r\n  contradicting the Disclosure Statement.Â  While this is clearly dispositive of\r\n  McLaughlinâ€™s claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, the circuit\r\n  court also noted several other grounds for granting summary judgment, and\r\n  McLaughlin appeals on those grounds as well.Â  For the sake of completeness, we\r\n  address those grounds.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nMcLaughlin\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in failing to apply the holding of MacFarlane\r\n    v. Manly, 274 S.C. 392, 395, 264 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1980), in which the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court held an â€œas isâ€ clause and a â€œright to inspectâ€\r\n  provision contained in a contract for sale do not, as a matter of law, bar an\r\n  action for fraud.Â  It is important to note, however, the circuit court did not\r\n  conclude the â€œas isâ€ clause and the â€œright to inspectâ€ provision contained in\r\n  the sales contract between McLaughlin and Williams barred McLaughlinâ€™s fraud\r\n  claims.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  order of the circuit court specifically states the â€œas isâ€ clause and the\r\n  â€œright to inspectâ€ provision did not bar the cause of action for fraud.Â \r\n  Rather, the circuit court determined the â€œas isâ€ clause and the â€œright to\r\n  inspectâ€ provision barred the claim for negligent misrepresentation as a matter\r\n  of law because he could not justifiably rely on the disclosure statement in\r\n  light of those provisions in the contract.Â  On appeal, McLaughlin challenges\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion on the basis that he did in fact inspect the\r\n  property and could rely on the Disclosure Statement in light of such\r\n  inspection.Â  However, having concluded McLaughlin could not rely on the\r\n  Disclosure Statement due to the information contained in the Home Inspection\r\n  Report and the CL-100, we cannot accept this argument.Â Â  \r\nMcLaughlin\r\n  also challenges the circuit courtâ€™s determination that Kingsmoreâ€™s knowledge is\r\n  imputed to McLaughlin due to their agency relationship. Â The circuit court did\r\n  not rely upon this determination for its conclusion, however, having already\r\n  found McLaughlin could not rely upon the Disclosure Statement based on the\r\n  information personally available to McLaughlin.Â  \r\nMcLaughlin also\r\n  argues he relied on Kingsmoreâ€™s knowledge, pointing to his own testimony that\r\n  she told him there was nothing to worry about after reviewing the Home\r\n  Inspection Report.Â  Kingsmore testified she informed McLaughlin the Home\r\n  Inspection Report showed moisture damage and a potential for structural\r\n  problems, and she advised him to have a contractor or electrician inspect the\r\n  house.Â  While this testimony may raise an issue of fact as to what Kingsmore\r\n  told McLaughlin, it does not raise an issue of fact as to whether McLaughlin\r\n  could rely on the Disclosure Statement.Â  McLaughlinâ€™s complaint alleges he is\r\n  entitled to recover based upon his reliance on the Disclosure Statement, as he\r\n  did not allege any other misrepresentations.Â  The information contained in the\r\n  Home Inspection Report and the CL-100 indicated there was moisture damage\r\n  within the Subject Property.Â  Based upon this information, McLaughlin could not\r\n  rely upon the Disclosure Statement.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition to finding McLaughlin could not rely upon the Disclosure Statement,Â \r\n  the circuit court granted summary judgment to Chicora on the grounds it did not\r\n  owe McLaughlin a duty to ensure the accuracy of the Disclosure Statement.Â \r\n  Specifically, the circuit court found the South Carolina Residential Property\r\n  Condition Disclosure Act (the Act) only imposes a duty on the owner of\r\n  real property to make disclosures about the property to be sold.Â  The circuit\r\n  court also pointed out that South Carolina Code Section 27-50-70(B) (2007)\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  The real estate\r\n    licensee, whether acting as the listing agent or selling agent, is not liable\r\n    to a purchaser if:\r\n  (1) the owner\r\n    provides the purchaser with a disclosure form that contains false, incomplete,\r\n    or misleading information; and\r\n  (2) the real estate licensee did not know or have reasonable cause\r\n    to suspect the information was false, incomplete, or misleading.\r\n\r\nUsing this language, the\r\n  circuit court concluded the Act imposed no duty on Chicora. \r\nMcLaughlin contends\r\n  the statute imposes a duty on Chicora in this instance because Chicora was\r\n  aware the Disclosure Statement was incomplete or misleading.Â  Under the\r\n  language of section 27-50-70(B), if a real estate licensee knows the\r\n  information is incomplete or misleading, the licensee may still be liable to\r\n  the purchaser.Â  \r\nHere, the record\r\n  supports a conclusion Chicora had knowledge the Disclosure Statement was\r\n  incomplete.Â  Specifically, the testimony from Kingsmore that she realized the\r\n  Disclosure statement was incomplete upon reading it; therefore, the record\r\n  supports the conclusion Chicora may be liable to McLaughlin based on the\r\n  Disclosure Statement.Â  However, such a conclusion is not adverse to our holding\r\n  that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Chicora.Â \r\n  The fact remains, McLaughlin was in possession of the Home Inspection Report\r\n  and the CL-100, and therefore, he could not rely upon the Disclosure Statement.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the orders of the circuit court are\r\nAFFIRMED.[3] \r\nHUFF\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] McLaughlin has since dropped his appeal against Dunes\r\n  Realty.Â  \r\n[2] While McLaughlin claims he was not concerned with\r\n  damage to the exterior of the property, the fact there was water damage\r\n  directly contradicts the Disclosure Statementâ€™s language indicating there was\r\n  no water damage whatsoever on the Subject Property.Â  \r\n[3] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
